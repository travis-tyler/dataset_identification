However, information technology is extremely expensive. In 2006, colleges and universities were expected to spend $6.94 billion on IT, which represented a 35% increase (Kiernan, 2006) from 2005. IT costs are expected to continue to escalate significantly in the future making the funding of IT a key issue for colleges and universities to address for the foreseeable future (Camp & Dubloy, 2007). With increasing calls for accountability in higher education, this research study tested a structural model that will help policy makers and administrators better understand the impact of information technology (IT) on the research productivity (research expenditures) and the learning productivity institutions. Because institutional mission effects the deployment of resources in higher education , the final sample of institutions was split into a research oriented group (research and doctoral) comprised of 219 institutions and a teaching oriented group (masters and baccalaureate) that included 166 institutions. The first research question addressed in the study was, \"How do the factors (technological, organizational, and environmental context) that influence the use of information technology affect institutional effectiveness in terms of the research productivity (research expenditures) and the learning productivity (undergraduate graduation rates) of a college or university? This research question was answered by examining two structural models based on five primary hypotheses and five foundational secondary hypotheses, one structural model for research oriented institutions and one for teaching oriented institutions. The results for the research oriented institution final institutional effectiveness model showed that all five primary hypotheses were supported xiii while four of the five foundational secondary hypotheses were supported. For teaching oriented institutions, four of the five primary research hypotheses were supported and four of the five foundational secondary hypotheses were supported. The second research question of this study was \"Are there differences in the impact of the factors (technological, organizational, and environmental context) that influence the use of information technology on institutional effectiveness based on the mission (research oriented or teaching oriented) of a college or a university? The second research question was answered by comparing a research oriented institution structural model to a teaching oriented institution structural model to determine if there were any significant differences between the two models. The results of this second research showed that the technological context had a much greater affect on institutional effectiveness in terms of the research and learning productivity of research oriented institutions than in teaching oriented institutions. Additionally, the technological context factor and organizational and environmental context factor were much more highly correlated in research oriented institutions than in teaching oriented institutions. The results showed that the technological context of research oriented institutions is very important to consider when making decisions related to the purchase of new IT resources as well as supporting and maintaining the IT infrastructure of the institution as well. On the other hand, the organizational and environmental context had a much greater affect on teaching oriented institutions, while the technological context factor affect was minimal. Future studies should build upon the findings of this study to advance the understanding and knowledge of the factors that affect IT use in higher education and how IT use impacts institutional effectiveness in relation to the research productivity (per capita research expenditures) and learning productivity (undergraduate graduation rates) of research and teaching oriented colleges and universities. Introduction"}, {"section_title": "Context of the Problem", "text": "With IT costs expected to continue to escalate significantly in the future, the funding of IT has become a key issue for colleges and universities to address for the foreseeable future (Camp & Dubloy, 2007). Amidst increasing calls for institutional effectiveness and accountability by stakeholders in higher education evidenced by the Spellings report (National Commission on the Future of Higher Education, 2006) regarding the future of U.S. higher education, colleges and universities were expected to spend $6.94 billion on information technology (IT) in 2006. This amount represented a 35% increase (Kiernan, 2006) from 2005. With an ever increasing amount of spending on information technology, the question is, \"What are the benefits and improvements created by IT in higher education?\" In short, are these IT expenditures well spent with a sound return on investment? Finding an answer to that question is difficult. Research on this issue in the private sector of business has generally found that IT has made a significant impact on organizational productivity. However, Carr (2003) is one researcher who questioned whether information technology really mattered in the corporate sector quest to gain a strategic advantage over competitors. Carr (2003) stated that in the corporate sector, companies emphasize the strategic value of information technology to gain a competitive edge. Companies dedicate significant amounts of personnel, money, and other resources in an effort to leverage their IT investments for differentiation and advantage. The thinking motivating these decisions is that as the power and capabilities of IT have increased, the strategic value of IT has increased as well. Contrarily, Carr (2003) argued that as information technology's power and ubiquity have grown, its strategic importance has actually diminished. IT is an infrastructural technology which Carr compared to the growth of the national rail network and the electric power grids. He said that IT is now at the end of the build out phase with greater capacity and falling prices making IT broadly accessible and affordable for expanding the infrastructure of a company. Carr declared that IT and its modes of use have become commoditized. As a result, companies that hope to gain a competitive advantage from this infrastructural technology can, at best, after its build out gain a cost advantage, which is difficult to sustain long term. On the other hand, Collins (2001) found that technology did make a competitive difference in the private sector. Information technology was an accelerator of momentum, although not a creator of it. He identified the most important factors for companies that made the transition from a good to a great company and sustained this greatness for 15 years. This extensive study looked at 1435 Fortune 500 companies between the years of 1965-1995. The final companies selected had fifteen-year cumulative stock returns at or below the general stock market, but after a transition point maintained cumulative returns at least three times the market over the next fifteen years. Only 11 companies made the final cut. Collins found that each of the 11 companies used technology as an accelerator to greatly exceed the performance of competitors. Collins claimed that the principles he identified in the private sector to transition from good to great could apply to other organizations, including education. However, this does not seem to be the case for higher education. Unlike other sectors of the economy, particularly the private sector where IT has made a significant impact on productivity, information technology has not led to increased administrative productivity in higher education in terms of efficiencies and cost savings gained related to the operation of colleges and universities (Bowen, 1968;Clotfelter, 1996, Martin, 2005. However, information technology has been linked to increases in research productivity (Clotfelter, 1996) and learning productivity (Bates, 2000) which is often measured with graduation rates serving as a proxy (Dugan & Hernon, 2006). In fact, Brint (2002) stated that no force has a greater potential to transform higher education than information technology. According to Duderstadt and Womack (2003), IT will not only transform teaching and research, but it will also transform how colleges and universities are financed and managed, and who will be regarded as students and faculty. Colleges and universities will need to be accountable for the use of their IT resources by relating the use of IT resources to outcomes of interest to both internal and external stakeholders, e.g. graduation rates (Hernon & Dugan, 2006) and research productivity. This will require colleges and universities to prioritize needed technologies to support the teaching, learning, and research needs of faculty and students (Dugan, 2002). While the \"prevailing view about faculty's research activity is that it dominates their time to the detriment of instruction\", research has shown that there can be a \"symbiotic relationship\" between teaching and research by incorporating undergraduate \"students into their research activity as assistants, faculty jointly produce contact with students (productive instructional activity) and research\" (Rhoades, 2001, p. 621). The IT resources of an institution can be utilized to facilitate this symbiotic relationship between teaching and research and lead to joint production of these two outcomes of interest by providing the virtual connections and tools and capabilities to collaborate with other faculty, students and/or researchers (Friedman, 2005). Prioritizing and making decisions about the technologies necessary to support teaching, learning, and research to meet the needs of faculty and students can be difficult. This is particularly true today. Colleges and universities are under greater scrutiny because different government entities have begun to question their investments in higher education. Taxpayers, federal and state governments, accrediting organizations, education associations, the business community, the internal community of colleges and universities, mass media, and prospective and enrolled students and their families are asking for evidence that colleges and universities are providing quality programs and services (Dugan, 2006b). Colleges and universities will need to demonstrate accountability for expenditures on information technology as well. This chapter provides an overview of the study. It begins with a statement of the purpose of the study and the conceptual framework. The research question, assumptions of the study, and the study limitations will follow. The chapter will conclude with an explanation of the significance of the study."}, {"section_title": "Purpose of the Study", "text": "The purpose of this study was to test a structural model that will aid policy makers and administrators in two ways to help them better understand the impact of information technology (IT) on the research productivity (per capita full time faculty research expenditures) and the learning productivity (undergraduate graduation rate) of a college or university. First, the structural model evaluated TOE theory in higher education by examining the theoretical factors that influence the use of IT. TOE theory is based on the Technological context, Organizational context, and Environmental context (TOE) of the institution (Tornatzky & Fleischer, 1990). Each of these three contexts of TOE was examined to evaluate the impact of TOE in higher education. Secondly, the model assessed the relationship between the TOE factors which theoretically lead to the use of IT and the institutional effectiveness in terms of the research productivity (research expenditures) and learning productivity (undergraduate graduation rate) of colleges and universities. Additionally, this structural model evaluated two separate groups based on the mission (research oriented or teaching oriented) of the institution to examine possible differences to the model based on the mission of the institution. While prior technologies have led to dramatic changes to society before such as the steam engine, telephone, automobile and railroad, in regards to information technology \"never before have we experienced a technology that has evolved so rapidly, increasing in power by a hundredfold or more every decade, radically changing the constraints of space and time, and reshaping the way the we communicate, think, and learn\" (Duderstadt, Atkins, & Van Houweling, 2002, p. 7). However, little research has been done to examine post adoption variations in the use of information technology for institutional effectiveness in higher education. While information systems research in the corporate sector is quite extensive, research specific to the context of higher education is relatively sparse. Additional research related to the adoption, use, and value of IT in higher education will aid policy makers and administrators in making complex and typically very expensive IT related decisions in the future. This study attempted to fill in some of the gaps in the current literature base. This study built upon the work of Getz, Siegried, & Anderson (1997) related to the adoption of innovations, including IT in higher education. They surveyed 238 colleges and universities in the US to identify the adoption rate of 30 innovations in curriculum, classrooms, student life, libraries, computing, and financial services. On average it took about 26 years to adopt the 30 innovations. Higher education institutions took about three times longer than the private sector to adopt innovations in these six types. Of the six types, computing and IT related library resources were adopted quicker than in the other four types of innovations that Getz, et al., evaluated. Ironically, financial innovations took the longest time to be adopted. Decisions to adopt financial innovations do not need to go through the time consuming consensus building process it takes to make decisions where faculty are involved such as with curriculum. This means that the adoption of financial innovations could potentially take place at a much quicker pace, yet this was not the case. In their study, Getz, et al., (1997) investigated the impact of six attributes of an innovation on the adoption of the innovation. They examined whether: 1) electronic devices, 2) boards of trustees making the innovation decision, 3) faculty making the innovation decision, 4) visibility of the innovation, 5) significant capital outlay, or 6) external vendor influence or promotion significantly impacted the adoption rate of these 30 innovations. Of these six innovation attributes, the regression results confirmed that only innovations that depend on electronics were adopted more rapidly than others. Getz, et al. (1997) found that large institutions were more likely to be earlier adopters of innovations. Research, doctoral, and baccalaureate (often referred to as \"liberal arts\" in the literature) institutions were more likely to be early adopters of innovations than masters (often referred to as \"comprehensive\" in the literature) institutions. Overall, public institutions were more likely to be early adopters than private institutions, but this varies based on the type of innovation. Little research has been done to build on the work of Getz, et al., (1997) regarding the adoption of innovations in higher education. The present study accounted for technological changes that have taken place since the Getz, et al. study and further added to the understanding of the adoption and use of information technology in higher education. This study also explored in greater depth the characteristics or attributes of colleges and universities and other internal and external factors that affect the adoption and use of IT innovations in higher education."}, {"section_title": "Conceptual Framework", "text": "This study examined the impact of the technological, organizational, and environmental context factors, which theoretically lead to IT use, on institutional effectiveness in higher education institutions. Zhu and Kraemer's (2005) model for studying the use and value of IT in the retail industry was adapted to study post adoption variations in the use of IT for institutional effectiveness in higher education, focusing on the research productivity and the learning productivity of the institution. The study accounted for the different context of higher education and drew upon the information systems, innovation diffusion, and strategic management literature to identify hypotheses for the study. The theoretical model for analyzing the impact of IT use on institutional effectiveness was based on the TOE framework (Tornatzky & Fleischer, 1990). The TOE framework looks at the technological, organizational, and environmental circumstances of an organization (see Fig 1.1: Proposed Institutional Effectiveness Structural Model). Each of these three contexts influences the process by which an institution adopts, implements, and uses technological innovations. The technological context describes \"both the existing technologies in use and new technologies relevant to the firm\" (Zhu & Kraemer, 2005, p. 63). The organizational context \"refers to descriptive measures about the organization such as scope, size, and the amount of slack resources available internally\" (Zhu & Kraemer, 2005, p. 63). The environmental context is the \"arena in which a firm conducts its business-it industry, competitors, access to resources supplied by others, and dealings with government\" (Tornatzky & Fleischer, 1990, p. 154). Rogers (1995) also linked the importance of studying the technological characteristics (including the technical knowledge or expertise of a firm) with studying the internal characteristics (including size and uncommitted resources available) as well as the external characteristics of the organization. The technological context was assessed in terms of the IT capacity (Internet2 bandwidth, Internet1 bandwidth, maximum speed on network, maximum speed through any Internet Connection, and number of high performance computers on campus) and IT capabilities (receive bandwidth from consortia, presence of dark fiber connected to Internet service provider, presence of dark fiber to connected to campus buildings) of the institution. The organizational context was examined based on the size (i.e. FTE student enrollment) and the potential financial commitment (i.e. total expenditures) of the institution. The environmental context was analyzed based on competitive pressure (i.e. prestige) and the regulatory support (i.e. regulatory control and governance) of the institution. TOE theory states that each of these three contexts impacts IT use. Each of these three contexts was evaluated to see the impact of each factor and its indicators on institutional effectiveness in higher education. Zhu and Kraemer evaluated the impact of IT use on three outcomes of interest to retail businesses: sales, procurement, and internal operations. IT value is a term common in private industry to describe the business value or effectiveness of IT in a corporation. In higher education, institutional effectiveness is the term used to describe the effectiveness of colleges and universities. Unlike the Zhu and Kraemer (2005) study used as a foundational model for this study, specific indicators measuring the extent IT use were not available. Therefore, TOE theory was used as the guide to look at IT use by evaluating the strength and positive or negative relationship of each TOE indicator for the TOE measurement model. As part of the analysis of the TOE measurement model, the correlations between the technological, organizational, and environmental context latent exogenous variables were also examined. Additionally, the TOE factors and indicators were inspected in the structural model to determine the impact of the TOE factors and indicators and IT use (with TOE theory serving as the guide to infer IT usage) on the institutional effectiveness latent variable. For this study, the institutional effectiveness of a college or university was based on the research productivity (i.e. the per capita full time faculty research expenditures or research dollars) of the institution and the learning productivity (i.e. undergraduate graduation rates) of the institution. IT has been utilized to increase both of these outcomes in higher education (Bates, 2000;Clotfelter, 1996). More importantly, the National Commission on the Future of Higher Education (2006) and the National Science Foundation (Bement, 2007) have called for higher education institutions to utilize IT to increase learning and research productivity to ensure that the United States can maintain its status as the leader in the production of and sharing of knowledge in the future."}, {"section_title": "Research Questions", "text": "This study developed a research model to examine the factors (technological, organizational, and environmental context) that lead to the use of information technology resources for institutional effectiveness in higher education.

However, faculty at larger institutions are more likely to be entrepreneurial, are more likely to be revenue generators through consulting and grants, and will be more likely to adopt technological innovations (Rowley & Shirman, 2001). Larger institutions will be adding more new faculty with new ideas to keep the institution abreast of developments elsewhere. In addition, larger institutions will have larger classes and may be more likely to adopt technological innovations that allow faculty to more easily manage the instruction of larger classes, as well as more likely to adopt cost saving and revenue enhancing innovations (Getz et al., 1997). In short, size will positively impact IT use in higher education."}, {"section_title": "Primary Hypotheses", "text": "\u2022 Primary Hypothesis 1: Institutions with a greater technological context (IT capacity and IT capabilities) are more likely to generate greater institutional effectiveness in terms of the research productivity and learning productivity of the institution. \u2022 Primary Hypothesis 2: Institutions with a greater organizational context (size and potential financial commitment to IT) are more likely to generate greater institutional effectiveness in terms of the research productivity and learning productivity of the institution. \u2022 Primary Hypothesis 3: Institutions with a greater environmental context (competitive pressure and regulatory support) are more likely to generate greater institutional effectiveness in terms of the research productivity and learning productivity of the institution. \u2022 Primary Hypothesis 4: Institutional effectiveness will be positively associated with research productivity (research expenditures). \u2022 Primary Hypothesis 5: Institutional effectiveness will be positively associated with learning productivity (undergraduate graduation rates)."}, {"section_title": "Secondary Hypotheses", "text": "\u2022 Secondary Hypothesis 1: IT capacity (Internet2 bandwidth, Internet1 bandwidth, maximum speed on network, maximum speed through any Internet Connection, and number of high performance computers on campus) and IT capability (receive bandwidth from consortia, presence of dark fiber connected to Internet service provider, presence of dark fiber to connected to campus buildings) indicators will positively impact the technological context and IT use. \u2022 Secondary Hypothesis 2: Size in terms of enrollment will be a positive indicator of the organizational context and IT use. \u2022 Secondary Hypothesis 3: Potential financial commitment to IT will be a positive indicator of the organizational context and IT use. \u2022 Secondary Hypothesis 4: Competitive pressure (in terms of prestige) will be a positive indicator of the environmental context and IT use. \u2022 Secondary Hypothesis 5: Regulatory support will be a positive indicator of the environmental context and IT use."}, {"section_title": "Assumptions of the Study", "text": "This study assumed that the respondents to the 2005 NSF Survey of Science and Engineering Research Facilities accurately responded to the survey about the IT resources of their institutions.

Fraenkel & Wallen (2003) define a limitation as an \"aspect of a study that the researcher knows may influence the results or generalizability of the results, but over which he or she has no control\" (p. G-4). This study included the limitation that the IT capacity and IT capabilities of each college and university were treated equally in terms of the quantity or speed of the IT infrastructure of the institution. However, in reality $1 spent on a given type of IT infrastructure/support does not equate to $1 spent on another. Not all pieces of the IT infrastructure that comprise the IT capacity and IT capabilities of the institution have similar value or costs or even uses associated with the other pieces of the IT infrastructure. The costs to purchase each piece of the infrastructure will differ for each institution based on the quantity purchased and the time of the purchase since the costs of a similar piece of IT infrastructure decreases significantly over time and purchases of greater quantity typically cost less than smaller purchases. In short, the acquisition costs and money spent to acquire and maintain the IT infrastructure would differ at each institution. However, since IT expenditure data was not available, this required the IT infrastructure of each college and university to be treated equally."}, {"section_title": "Significance of the Study", "text": "The National Commission on the Future of Higher Education (2006) criticized policy makers and even students and families for making too many decisions concerning higher education based on reputation and rankings derived from inputs rather than outcomes such as student learning outcomes. The Commission also criticized colleges and universities for not embracing opportunities for innovation. The Commission called upon colleges and universities to take advantage of technological advances to develop new or better methods of teaching and content delivery to increase student learning. Meanwhile, Arden L. Bement, director of the National Science Foundation, has called for research colleges and universities to make greater efforts to better utilize their cyberinfrastructures as an integral part of research and education across the board, not just in the sciences, but also in the humanities and the arts. Bement (2007) suggested that \"leadership in cyberinfrastructure may well become the major determinant in measuring pre-eminence in higher education among nations\" (p. B5). Traditionally, people have thought of theory and experiments as the tools for conducting scientific research. Computers have and will continue to become just as important tools for conducting and advancing scientific research (Gunzburger & Wilgenbusch, 2007). Utilizing the IT resources of colleges and universities is vital for the United States to maintain its status as the leader in advancing and developing new research and knowledge. We live in a knowledge-driven world with many competitive forces at work globally and a growing demand for highly skilled labor. In order for the US to compete in the future Bement (2007) suggested that \"the rapid pace of new technology development along with growing investments in research and education around the world should signal to us that no nation can afford to be complacent. We must continue to invent the future and fine-tune our national innovation systems. A robust cyberinfrastructure is central to that future\" (p. B5). Colleges and universities must answer the call to take advantage of technological advances to develop new or better methods of teaching and content delivery to meet the increasing demand for lifelong learning. Higher education institutions must also play a key role in advancing and developing new research. While colleges and universities have traditionally looked at information technology as merely a capital expenditure or an experimental tool, Duderstadt, et al., (2002) argued that colleges and universities should instead view IT as an investment and as a strategic asset critical to the fundamental academic mission and quality of the institution. Understanding post adoption variations in the use of information technology resources for institutional effectiveness will help institutions of higher education and policy makers understand factors that influence the use of and value gained from technological resources to increase the learning productivity (in terms of undergraduate graduation rates) and the research productivity (in terms of research expenditures) of the institution."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "This chapter introduced the issue of studying the use of information technology resources for institutional effectiveness of colleges and universities. The purpose and the conceptual framework for this study were presented. The research questions, assumptions of the study, and the study limitations were given and the significance of the study was described. There is a lack of a substantial body of research examining the impact of the factors (technological, organizational, and environmental context) that lead to the use of information technology resources and the impact of these factors on institutional effectiveness in higher education. It is vital that colleges and universities embrace opportunities for innovation by utilizing technological advances and the IT resources of their institutions to advance and share knowledge in this information society. This study served as an exploratory study of the factors that influence the adoption and use of IT and the impact of these factors on the institutional effectiveness of US colleges and universities. The study explored the relationship between the IT resources of colleges and universities and the learning productivity (in terms of undergraduate graduation rates) and the research productivity (in terms of per capita full time faculty research expenditures) of the institution. The next chapter provides a review of the literature pertaining to the variables presented in the conceptual framework as well as other literature pertinent to understanding the adoption of innovations within the context of higher education.\nThis chapter outlined the methods and procedures that were used to guide this study. The chapter included the research question and explained the design of the study. Research hypotheses were delineated. The population of the study, data sources, and variables were described. In addition, the procedures that were used for the study and the analysis were explicated. The next chapter will present the results of the data analysis.\nThis chapter presented the results of the data analysis. The purpose of this study was to test a structural model to explore the influence of information technology (IT) on the research productivity (per capita full time faculty research expenditures) and the learning productivity (undergraduate graduation rate) of a college or university. Descriptive statistics were provided. Results for the foundational technological, organizational, and environmental context (TOE) measurement model were given for research oriented institutions followed by the results for teaching oriented institutions. Afterwards, results for the full structural model for institutional effectiveness were provided, first for research oriented institutions and next for teaching oriented institutions. A review of the results for the TOE measurement models for both the research and teaching oriented institutions illustrated differences between the two groups of institutions. The influence of the technological, organizational, and environmental context was very different in the separate groups. The analysis of both TOE models showed that the organizational and environmental context factors needed to be combined. For the combined organizational and environmental (OE) context factor, large differences with two of the indicators of this factor were observed. For research oriented institutions, competitive pressure had a moderate positive effect (.473) on the OE factor while competitive pressure had a moderate negative effect (-.550) on the same OE factor for teaching oriented institutions. In regards to regulatory support, it was clear that the state government had a much greater influence teaching oriented institutions (.745) than on research oriented institutions (-.041). The greatest difference with the technological context factor was the moderate standardized total effect of high performance computing for research oriented institutions of .507 compared to a small standardized total effect of .082 for teaching oriented institutions. Furthermore, the correlations between the technological context and the combined organizational/environmental contexts were very different for both models with a high correlation between these two factors of .80 for research oriented institutions but a low correlation of .25 between these two factors for teaching oriented institutions. The results of the full structural model for institutional effectiveness for research and teaching oriented institutions also shed light on institutional mission differences. An admissible solution was found for research oriented institutions that showed that the technological context had a higher standardized total effect of .50 on institutional effectiveness than the combined organizational/environmental context factor of .34. Internet2 bandwidth (.784) and Internet1 bandwidth (.851) had the highest standardized total effects in this model for the technological context factor while the two indicators of the organizational and environmental context factor representing financial and other resources of the institution of 1) potential financial commitment to IT (.980) and 2) size (.671) had the highest standardized total effects in the research oriented institution institutional effectiveness structural model. For teaching oriented institutions, an admissible solution was not found for the institutional effectiveness structural model unless a regression weight was placed on the structural parameter connecting the technological context factor and the institutional effectiveness factor (a regression weight of \"1\" was used). After this was done, the best admissible solution showed a low standardized total effect of the technological context on institutional effectiveness of .10 while the combined organizational and environmental (OE) context factor had a high standardized total effect of .90. Similar to research oriented institutions, Internet2 bandwidth (.967) and Internet1 bandwidth (.535) had the highest standardized total effects for the technological context factor. However, for the OE context factor, competitive pressure (prestige) had by far the highest standardized total effect (-.902) in the teaching oriented institutional effectiveness structural model. It should be noted that size and financial commitment to IT were much more highly correlated at .86 for the teaching oriented institution model compared to .67 for the research oriented institution model which required the removal of the potential financial commitment to IT from the teaching oriented institution model. Instead, size served as a proxy for financial resources of the institution. Therefore, the OE context factors were not identical for the teaching oriented institution and research oriented institution models. Overall, the data analyses showed that the technological context had a large impact on research oriented institutions but a small impact on teaching oriented institutions.

For this study information technologies were \"tools or tool systems by which we transform parts of our environment, derived from human knowledge, to be used for human purposes\" (Tornatsky & Fleischer, 1990, p. 10). Technological innovation \"involves the situationally new development and introduction of knowledge-derived tools, artifacts, and devices by which people extend and interact with their environment\" (Tornatsky & Fleischer, 1990, p. 11). Institutional effectiveness of the institution was based on the research productivity (in terms of publications and research expenditures) and the learning productivity (in terms of undergraduate graduation rate) of the institution. The following literature review provides the foundation for conducting this research study. The review consists of five major sections. The first section provides an overall description of the history of IT and an overview of IT in higher education. The second section illustrates elements important for understanding the current context of higher education. The third section reviews the impact of IT on productivity and prior research on the adoption of IT and other innovations in higher education. The fourth section discusses the research question variables used in the study. The fifth section explains the elements of the proposed model for the study. A summary concludes the literature review."}, {"section_title": "Section 1: History and Overview of Information Technology in Higher Education", "text": "Society has changed significantly over the past half-century and what society needs and demands of colleges and universities who create and disseminate knowledge has changed significantly as well (Duderstadt, 1999). Before these changes took place, society was known as the industrial society and needed and demanded that colleges and universities focus efforts on creating and disseminating knowledge specific to manufacturing or industrial developments and advances. The new information society resulted from numerous societal advances and the development of new technologies. These new technologies have led to globalization and transformed the economy of all industrialized nations throughout the world. The key feature of the industrial society was the distribution network of railroads and canals to transport raw materials and finished goods to allow economies to develop. In the current information society, the key feature is the networks that allow for the global distribution of information (Law, 2000). Society has become more knowledge intensive with information becoming the most important institutional resource. Unlike natural resources such as iron and oil, knowledge is inexhaustible and the more it is used the more it multiplies and expands. This makes colleges and universities as creators and providers of knowledge increasingly important institutions (Duderstadt, et al., 2002;Duderstadt & Womack, 2003) to society. Developments coming from the information society have impacted higher education and led to better ways of doing things. As innovations come that lead to better ways of doing things, colleges and universities will need to respond and adjust to account for societal and economic changes taking place (Rowley & Sherman, 2001). However, though change is inevitable, an institution's ability to adapt to change is not (Bryson, 2004). For the most part, colleges and universities have been slow to change. Academic institutions are not immune to the dramatic changes of the emerging information age and must make changes to adapt. \"Information is the foundation of education\"\u2026and \"permeates every aspect of university and college life\". \u2026The \"creation, dissemination, understanding and preservation\" of information is central to what colleges and universities have been and continue to be called upon to do (Law, 2000, p. 146). While information serves as the foundation of education, information technologies form the information architecture for a college or university. The information architecture continues to become a more important piece of a higher education institution. Even the brick and mortar of the ivory towers of academia now take a back seat to the importance of the information architecture of the institution that enables faculty, administration, students, and staff to carry out their activities that support the creation and dissemination of information by the institution (Duderstadt & Womack, 2003). Colleges and universities wishing to develop international reputations and links will need to utilize the information resources of the institution to compete globally. Colleges and universities have begun to treat knowledge as a raw material evidenced by significant increases in patents issued to colleges and universities per year, increases in universities acquiring equity in companies licensing their technology, as well as increases in the copyright of materials and contracting of other intellectual property produced by higher education institutions (Bok, 2003;Slaughter & Rhoades, 2004). Influencing this has been technological changes that provide great opportunities to advance knowledge through research and to allow students access to education materials and a wide variety of vehicles for teaching and learning. IT makes it possible to provide access to students restricted by distance, life commitments with work and family, or who are place bound at home. Today, students use IT resources of a college or university connected to the Internet to complete a number of tasks such as registering for classes, paying their student fees, receiving advisement and counseling, or even attending orientation. The pervasiveness of IT makes it vital for students to become comfortable utilizing IT and for colleges and universities to infuse their teaching with instructional technologies. IT is also important in continuing to advance knowledge through research. Higher education institutions have recognized the increasing role of IT in terms of teaching and conducting research. Subsequently, IT infrastructure has increasingly become a recruiting tool for faculty and students with colleges and universities competing for high rank in terms of the IT infrastructure of the institution (Duderstadt & Womack, 2003;Slaughter & Rhoades, 2004). However, the IT and capital infrastructure, equipment, staffing, and faculty training costs are significant and must be understood in order for higher education institutions to exploit the capabilities of IT to benefit students and society (Zumeta, 2004)."}, {"section_title": "History of IT in Higher Education", "text": "Information technology has been used in higher education to aid with research, administrative work, and instruction for many years. The development of an ever growing use of and reliance on IT to conduct the research, administrative, and instructional operations of a higher education institution traces back to the invention of the Internet in the 1960s. The Internet actually was first conceived with research funded by the National Science Foundation to design a network as part of a project called the Defense Agency Research Projects Administration (known as DARPA). The idea was to prototype a communications infrastructure for the US military that could withstand a nuclear attack and continue to operate even if a key communication node was knocked out during an attack by another country. The Internet first connected four universities, UCLA, Stanford, UC Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah in 1968. The Internet allowed scientists to collaborate with one another and share research with one another in ways not previously possible. Scientists used the Internet to exchange electronic messages which are now typically referred to as e-mail. As a result, the use of e-mail to communicate with other scientists became more and more common in the academic science community (Reid, 1997). In the 1980s, the next major development in IT was the invention of the microcomputer or personal computer (PC). Before this time, computing was isolated to main frame computers. The PC allowed users to have computing power available to them on their own personal machines while maintaining the ability to share files and share programs without reliance on a huge mainframe computer operator (Hayes, Pisano, Upton, & Wheelwright, 2005). Since the initial introduction of the PC into higher education the use of computers across the campus has multiplied \"faster than the proverbial hare\" (Rowley, Lujan, & Dolence, 1997, p. 20). The development of the PC was followed by advances in software that eased user access based on the emergence of a market standard platform for PCs and also for software applications including the Microsoft Windows operating system. These software applications made it convenient for users to adopt software products that were compatible with complementary hardware, i.e. computers and peripherals (Torrisi, 1998). In 1990, Microsoft released its Windows 3.0 operating system. Prior to this time, the user had to have a fairly good technical understanding to operate the computer. The Windows 3.0 operating system included a graphical user interface which made it easier for users to navigate their computers, even if they were not technically inclined (Friedman, 2005). In the early 1990s, the growth of the Internet was fueled by Tim Berners Lee and his research group. Together they developed Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) which was the technology behind the World Wide Web (WWW). HTML provided the software and networking protocols used by computers to communicate over the network to allow any computer to browse for information (Reid, 1997). Hypertext is text with links to other information that can be accessed with a mouse click anywhere in the world (Hayes, et al, 2005). Before HTML was introduced, the user could only read plain text online. HTML provided the ability to format text with images and media using the Internet (Friedman, 2005). These protocols merged computer networking and hypertext into a powerful and easy to use global information system (Hayes, et al, 2005). In 1993, Marc Andreesen and scientists at the University of Illinois developed Mosaic using funding from the National Science Foundation. Mosaic was the first Internet browser. Mosaic allowed the user to browse documents and navigate among not only different documents but among different computers using point and click commands called \"hyper-links\" (Reid, 1997). This Internet browser used HTML and made the computer and its connectivity more useful for non-technical users (Friedman, 2005). Netscape became the first commercial Internet browser in 1994, opening the Internet to the masses, not just the academic research community. Since then, because Netscape allowed anyone to connect with anyone else anywhere on any machine, Internet usage has exponentially increased (Reid, 1997). In the late 1990s, another significant development related to IT was the Internet stock boom. This was important because it sparked a huge investment in fiber-optic cable companies that in turn laid substantial amounts of fiber-optic cable on land and under the ocean. This huge investment in fiber-optic infrastructure affected users of the Internet in the United States as well as users elsewhere around the world by extensively increasing the previous bandwidth and networking infrastructure. The expansion significantly lowered the cost of phone calls and transmitting data which could now travel through this fiber-optic cable infrastructure and also created a more seamless global commercial network. As fiber-optic switches continue to improve, capacity will keep growing making it cheaper and easier to transmit voice and data to other parts of the world (Friedman, 2005). Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems became important pieces of the IT infrastructure of many businesses and colleges and universities in the 1990s. These enterprise wide information systems aim to integrate most of an organization's IT-based business processes. Instead of relying on disparate and often localized IT systems throughout different parts of the organization, ERP systems make it possible to compare and aggregate data and for information systems to be networked across remote sites to share data and information (Hayes, et al., 2005). Another important technological development in the 1990s was that of the search engine. The first search engine to become really popular was Yahoo, which started out as \"Jerry's Guide to the World Wide Web\". Yahoo developed from there into a sophisticated web site that attempted to map the Internet for a user wanting to find information (Reid, 1997). Later Google, founded in 1995, was able to determine which web pages were most relevant to the specific search being conducted. Google was founded with a goal to make easily available all of the world's knowledge in every language, to organize the seemingly infinite amount of information available on the Web for the user at anytime and anywhere (Friedman, 2005). In the early 21 st century, file sharing began to impact industry and higher education. File sharing allows peers to exchange files stored on each other's computers. As file sharing became an option, students used it to illegally download music and movie files. However, in 2005, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) sued several college students and universities for illegally downloading music and videos. As a result, colleges and universities have had to identify ways to protect themselves from lawsuits by RIAA and similar parties that may lead to the courts levying fines and/or other forms of punishment on the institution for violating music, movie, and/or other copyrights (Carter & Jefferson, 2006). Some institutions protect themselves from adverse consequences related to the use of file sharing by users of the campus network by limiting the amount of bandwidth students and faculty can use at one time and suspending network privileges if students are caught. Some institutions have set up licensing agreements to allow legal access. Other campuses have completely blocked or disabled file sharing opportunities on campus (Carter & Jefferson, 2006). Whatever the institution decides, the decision can incur significant costs to the college or university to pay for licenses, monitoring software, and IT staff to manage the networks so that the institution's users can conduct teaching, learning, and research while also providing users the ability to enjoy social and personal applications of the networks as well. Voice over IP, video conferencing, and wireless Internet access have also impacted how higher education will do business in the future. Voice over IP allows the user to make phone calls over the data network of a college or university and over time can save institutions significant amounts of money. Voice over IP also allows the institution to leverage its voice and data networks in providing online multimedia teaching, research, and collaboration opportunities for faculty, students, administrators, and other users of the campus network (Burton, 2006). As colleges or universities expand their network capacity and as overall bandwidth increases, institutions can significantly reduce video conferencing costs and provide sophisticated virtual collaboration opportunities (Duderstadt & Womack, 2003). Additionally, the development of wireless technologies which allow someone to access the Internet, e-mail or any business files anytime, anywhere using a cell phone, Palm Pilot or some other personal device will significantly change the way colleges and universities will collaborate and communicate in the future (Friedman, 2005)."}, {"section_title": "Uses of IT in Higher Education", "text": "Information technology is used in a number of ways in higher education. IT is used for administrative purposes, to conduct research, and for teaching and learning. IT will \"flatten\", as Friedman (2005) described it, the way higher education institutions operate in the future. Information technology has \"flattened\" the way the world conducts business in the private sector. No longer does someone need to be located in the United States to compete for \"white collar\" jobs in knowledge based industries prevalent in this information society. Rather, employees living in China, India, Russia, and elsewhere around the world can compete for knowledge based work without physically being located at a brick and mortar United States based location because IT has \"flattened\" the world. This \"flattened\" world has enabled several highly skilled services and jobs to be outsourced to other countries (Carmel & Tija, 2005;Friedman, 2005;Lu, 2000). Previously, just lower level \"blue collar\" jobs, such as manufacturing related work, were outsourced to other countries. Use of IT for Administrative Purposes. The management and administrative processes of colleges and universities are heavily dependent on IT. Rather than paper based processes which needed to take place in person, some management and administrative processes now take place almost completely online using the IT resources of the institution. Colleges and universities use IT to run operations for financial aid, communication, admissions, registration, student records, plus a number of other functions (O' Donovan, 2000). IT will continue to have a significant impact on the administrative processes of colleges and universities in the future. Use of IT for Research. Researchers are also heavily dependent upon IT. Information technology combined with the Internet and digital media has clearly enriched the research environment for scientists and scholars. Researchers use computers to \"simulate physical phenomena, networks link investigators in virtual laboratories\u2026and digital libraries provide scholars with access to knowledge resources\" (Duderstadt & Womack, 2003, p. 59). In addition, library and information services play an important role in developing new knowledge and/or understanding for both students and faculty (Elkin, 2000;Foster, 2000). Information technology will have a significant impact on the way research is conducted in the future. The US is predicted to lose 3.3 million IT white collar office jobs to offshore locations by 2015. Because the IT infrastructure and human capital is in place around the world to justify this large migration of jobs for highly educated workers (Carmel & Tija, 2005), the hallowed ivory towers of academia will also be impacted. Instead of the lead researcher in the lab working side by side with numerous graduate students and a research team, the significant investment by telecommunications companies to increase bandwidth during the dotcom era will provide the opportunity to tap into and utilize international talent located in India, China, Russia, and elsewhere in the world, not just those who are physically located on a college campus. Research universities have already begun to set up significant virtual research lab arrangements and experiments with universities around the world to better utilize the human capital located in other countries in this \"flattened\" world (Friedman, 2005). . The integration of instructional   technologies of computer mediated communication with multimedia courseware,   electronic libraries and databases has significantly impacted teaching and learning practices. Colleges and universities use IT to improve their teaching activities including the engagement of students with subject matter content, activation of learning, assessment of learning outcomes, and provision of feedback to students (Naidu, 2003). In addition, the use of emerging instructional technologies supports learning and instruction in more challenging and complex domains. This encourages the decision to explore the uses of not just the simple but also the uses of more advanced technologies to facilitate learning (Milrad, Spector, & Davidsen, 2003)."}, {"section_title": "Use of IT for Teaching and Learning", "text": "Distance education has exploded since 1995 when the World Wide Web and the Netscape Internet browser made online learning a reality. Online learning will only continue to grow in the future. As Bates (2000) stated, \"The new technologies of the Internet and multimedia are not just enhancing the teaching and learning environment; they are fundamentally changing it\"\u2026and are \"having as profound an impact on education as the invention of the printing press did\" (p. 215). These technologies provide the possibility of not only enhancing classroom instruction but also of reaching out in this \"flattened\" world to new target groups such as lifelong learners, people in the workforce, and the physically disabled."}, {"section_title": "Impact of IT Capacity and IT Capabilities on IT Use in Colleges and Universities", "text": "The IT capacity and IT capabilities of an institution will impact the ability of an institution to use IT to meet short term as well as long term institutional goals, outcomes, and objectives such as producing more research and learning in the future. For this study, the IT capacity consisted of the networking and computing capacity of the institution. The IT capabilities examined whether or not the institution received bandwidth from a consortia, had dark fiber connected to an Internet service provider (ISP), or had dark fiber connected to buildings on campus. IT Capacity. The IT functionalities of a college or university consist of the frontend functionality that the user sees when utilizing the IT infrastructure of the institution and the back-end functionality comprised of the computing and networking capacity and resources of the institution. Computing capacity allows the user to conduct sophisticated calculations and modeling and simulations. Networking capacity allows the user to access, share, and exchange data and to communicate with other users. Both front-end functionality and back-end functionality will impact the use of IT in an organization. However, front-end functionality is public and open on the Internet and can be easily observed and copied by competitors (Carr, 2003). Back-end functionality enables information sharing within the organization and along the value chain. Back-end functionality is much more difficult to imitate and is tailored to an organization's strategic context and woven into the organization's fabric which is not transparent to competitors. As a result, back-end functionality has a much stronger impact on the organization (Zhu & Kraemer, 2005). This study will focus on the back-end functionality and will be referred to as the IT capacity of the institution. IT capacity will be measured in terms of the computing and networking capacity of the institution. Greater computing and networking capacity allows researchers to conduct more sophisticated and complicated research experiments and studies in a quicker and more efficient manner and provides greater options and capabilities for teaching students. The continual rapid increase in computing speed and bandwidth makes it very important for colleges and universities to continually expand the computing and networking capacity of the institution in order to take advantage of the possibilities and opportunities provided by this evolution. Computing and networking capacities are predicted to evolve at rates of a thousand fold every decade or faster. The rapid expansion of computing capacity has led to the development of new sciences such as quantum computing, molecular computers, and biocomputing (Duderstadt, et al., 2002;Duderstadt & Womack, 2003). These technological developments make it important for colleges and universities to have the new technologies available in order to study and further expand research in these new sciences. However, the greater impact is the rapid evolution of and the dramatic increase in networking capacity and bandwidth. This is what is often referred to as the network effect or network externalities which are based on the increasing attractiveness and value to users of certain kinds of networks as they increase in size and more users use the network. The first telephone or fax machine had little value since there was nobody to call. As more people acquired telephones, telephones became more useful, and more people were perceived value in having one. The value of a network increases faster than the volume through it (Hayes, et al., 2005;Torrisi, 1998). In the 21 st century with terabit per second networks soon transporting data at the equivalent rate of over one thousand miles per hour, there will soon exist what Bell laboratories calls a \"global communications skin\" linking billions of computers handling the routine tasks of society (Duderstadt & Womack, 2003). Greater networking capacity will allow a college or university to more fully exploit any advantages that come from having the capacity required to do so. Important components of the computing and networking capacity of a higher education institution include private Internet II connections through the Abilene connection, National LamdaRail connection, and/or some other federal government research network connection. Though costly, high performance computing systems on campus make up an important piece of the IT infrastructure needed to maximize institutional capabilities and to take full advantage of available networking capacity. Commodity Internet bandwidth, which the general public connects to, provides the ability to communicate with external institutions and users in addition to those on campus. The maximum speed through the institution's network impacts a user's ability to share information internally while the maximum speed through any Internet connection impacts a user's ability to share information externally. All of these IT infrastructure components form important pieces of the back-end functionality of the IT infrastructure of an institution. Each component relies upon other components comprising the back-end functionality in order to perform the computations requested, exchange data and information, conduct searches, and/or to learn. IT Capabilities. Current and future IT capabilities will also impact the use of IT in higher education. The current supplier integration capabilities of an institution affect the use of IT (Zhu & Kraemer, 2005). Supplier integration refers to the ability of the institution to share of data and information with suppliers. The sharing and exchanging of data and information is very important to colleges and universities. In this study, the supplier integration capability was based on whether the institutions shared bandwidth with consortia. Another approach to escalating costs for IT has been to join consortia in order to share the cost of making IT purchases. A consortium is a collaboration of any combination of educational institutions, government agencies, vendors, or non-profit organizations with the purpose of coordinating and facilitating networking activities, as well as other services (National Science Foundation, 2005). Consortia allow colleges and universities to share IT or other resources, make group IT purchases to lower IT costs, and/or to share and exchange knowledge or data. Consortia allow colleges and universities to combine to have greater bargaining and purchasing power when negotiating IT purchases with vendors. Colleges or universities use consortia to spread out not only the costs but also to share the risks associated with adopting new technologies as well as to acquire new technological capabilities whose in-house development would require a longer time and higher costs (Torrisi, 1998). In addition, consortia allow colleges and universities to collaborate with other consortia members to better understand how to implement and utilize the technologies they share in order to make informed decisions in relation to IT investments (Duderstadt & Womack, 2003). Colleges and universities with consortia connections will experience greater IT use and institutional effectiveness than those without. Additionally, future IT capabilities play an important role in preparing to utilize IT to benefit the institution in the future. Future IT capabilities represent the use of long term IT strategic planning at the institution. In this study two future IT capability indicators were evaluated to see the impact of long term IT strategic planning on the technological context of the institution. These two future IT capabilities were 1) whether the institution had acquired dark fiber to their Internet Service Provide (ISP) and 2) whether the institution had dark fiber connected to their buildings. Dark fiber is fiberoptic cable that has already been laid but is not being used by the institution (National Science Foundation, 2005). Institutions that had acquired dark fiber to their ISP and that had dark fiber connected to their buildings would have a greater ability to rapidly expand capacity as demands for IT and use of IT rises in the future. Institutions with the presence of both of these future IT capability indicators would be better prepared to tap into and strategically utilize IT to realize intended goals, outcomes, and objectives such as producing more research and learning in the future."}, {"section_title": "Current and Future Trends for IT Capacity of Higher Education Institutions", "text": "The networking and computing capacity of colleges and universities continues to increase dramatically each year. The 2005 NSF Survey of Science and Engineering Research Facilities (SSERF) reported the current computing and networking capacity of 452 colleges and universities that grant degrees in science or engineering and expended at least $1 million in research and development (R&D) funds in fiscal year 2004. The survey also asked respondents to indicate future plans for expansion of computing and networking capacity through fiscal year 2006. Christovich (2007)  showed that research performing institutions continue to emphasize the expansion and acquisition of computing and networking resources which comprise the overall information infrastructure or \"cyberinstrastructure\" of the institution. Institutions recognize that advances in computing and networking capacity are not \"simply changing the conduct of science, but are revolutionizing it\" (p. 1). In regards to external networking connections, Christovich (2007) reported that 43% of the institutions had combined commodity Internet (Internet1) and Abilene (Internet2) connection speeds greater than 155 megabits. In comparison, Christovich noted that most residential customers in the United States generally connect to the Internet at rates of one to six megabits. At the time of the survey, 21% reported bandwidth at 1 gigabit or greater, but this number was expected to jump to 30% by the next year (i.e. 2006). In terms of the internal networking connections at the institution, the highest speed from one desktop to another was 100 megabits at 64% of the institutions with 33% of the institutions having a highest speed between one to 2.5 gigabits. Noteworthy as well is that although only 4% had desktop to desktop connection speeds at greater than 2.5 gigabits in the 2005 survey, over 14% of the institutions estimated that their highest speed would be 2.5 gigabits by the next year. Christovich also reported that the presence of high-performance computing resources continues to grow among research performing colleges and universities. She found that 62% of these institutions had at least one high-performance computing system. Based on these trends, it is clear that in the near future higher education institutions will continue to spend money on acquiring increased networking and high-performance computing capacity at the highest rates possible. Furthermore in the long term, Duderstadt, et al., (2002) predicted that this explosive growth of information technology will continue to follow an exponential growth trajectory which will significantly impact higher education and society well into the future as a result of \"relentlessly increasing in power by factors of 100-to 1,000-fold decade after decade\" (p. 9)."}, {"section_title": "Section 2: Current Context of Higher Education", "text": "As part of a study of information technology within higher education it is important to understand the current context of higher education. Rising costs, declining resources, and calls from stakeholders of higher education for increased accountability, the efficient use of resources, and outcomes assessment have increased. These factors along with others influence the deployment of resources, including IT, in higher education. A review of external and internal forces influencing higher education institutions pertinent to the study of IT in higher education follows."}, {"section_title": "Rising Costs", "text": "The costs of higher education continue to rise and have been rising faster than costs in every other sector of the economy except for health care (Martin, 2005). One factor influencing the increasing costs of higher education comes as a result of the expansion of knowledge and the increasing sophistication of scientific research (Clotfelter, 1996). In addition, faculty salaries have significantly increased, particularly in private research and doctoral universities as a result of competition with other institutions for the services and expertise of star faculty. In order to compete, colleges and universities must match national salary norms or settle for less than the best candidates for open positions (Duderstadt & Womack, 2003;Ehrenberg, 2002;Rowley, et al, 1997). Strategies used by many colleges and universities to try and offset these rising costs include a combination of expanding undergraduate enrollments and having graduate assistants or adjuncts teach large undergraduate classes. The cost legislators, parents, and students have typically been most concerned with has been the rapid increase of tuition rates at colleges and universities. The pressure by these key stakeholders on colleges and universities to control the rapid rise in tuition rates has led campus leaders to look for new ways of controlling costs to reduce the need for tuition increases, and/or to find other sources for funding (Suskie, 2006). The tremendous rise in tuition rates places a great burden on students, their families, and the public who supply the subsidies to the college or university and is a very important issue for colleges and universities to address (Martin, 2005)."}, {"section_title": "Declining Resources", "text": "Federal and state funding has continued to decrease since the rapid significant investment in higher education by the government in the 1950s and 1960s. Higher education institutions must compete for government funding with other funding priorities and other higher education institutions. States are less inclined to provide funding necessary to public universities and have increased focus on other social priorities such as crime prevention, health care, and K-12 education (Duderstadt & Womack, 2003). States have limited revenue increases in campus budgets and reduced overall allocations to colleges and universities. Both private and public universities have had to find other funding sources to make up for declining financial support from the government (Kerr, 2001). Bowen's (1980) four laws of educational costs state or describe the dominant goals of higher education institutions. The laws of higher education institution educational costs are:"}, {"section_title": "Accountability and Institutional Effectiveness", "text": "1) The dominant goals of institutions are educational excellence, prestige, and influence. 2) In the quest of excellence, prestige, and influence, there is virtually no limit to the amount of money an institution could spend for seemingly fruitful educational ends. 3) Each institution raises all the money it can. 4) Each institution spends all that the money it raises which leads toward ever increasing expenditure. While Bowen's four laws are a generalization and may not always be true, the laws describe the dominant goals and related actions of higher education institutions. With higher education institutions focused on spending all the money they can raise, the only limit in this circumstance is cost. If costs rise, institutions will respond by requesting and seeking more revenue. Bowen's theory of costs has not gone unnoticed by the public who have increasingly criticized higher education institutions and called for greater accountability and institutional effectiveness. As Duderstadt and Womack (2003) stated we live in an \"audit\" society, in which accountability and performance matter. Colleges and universities are now under greater scrutiny because different government entities have begun to question their investments in higher education. Taxpayers, federal and state governments, accrediting organizations, education associations, the business community, the internal community of colleges and universities, mass media, and prospective and enrolled students and their families are all asking for evidence that colleges and universities are providing quality programs and services (Dugan, 2006b). Suskie (2006) listed a number of reasons that public attention to higher education has increased along with growing demands for accountability and institutional effectiveness. The increased need for higher education has increased public attention to what colleges and universities are doing to provide opportunities for students to receive a college education. Concerns about the success rates of low-income students and minorities and the overall retention of students along with the fact that costs of higher education to students, their families, and taxpayers are growing faster than the cost of living have also increased public attention to what colleges and universities are doing. Public concerns regarding higher education also include the quality of higher education's activities and products, higher education's historical reticence for documenting and sharing what it does and what it accomplishes, and higher education's reluctance to acknowledge its shortcomings and improve what it does. Each of these reasons has influenced the growing demands for accountability and institutional effectiveness in higher education. Higher education has become a \"prime target for accountability in terms of how faculty spend their time, what the products of higher education are, and what costs are associated with those products\" (Middaugh, 2001, p. 163). Faculty tenure has become another contentious issue of political debates along with a call for greater accountability for faculty (Angelo, 2000). Boards of trustees have turned up the heat for accountability along with state legislatures that believe that their best possible option is to legislate change (Lucas, 2000). These groups want to know what return there is on their investment in terms of the tangible products of higher education in the core mission areas of instruction, research, and public service (Middaugh, 2001). With reductions in federal and state government appropriations, private donors and company contributions are becoming more important. Private donors seek greater accountability for the use of their funds for academic projects and seek to control the research agenda. Accreditation bodies have also joined the debate regarding accountability and institutional effectiveness in higher education (Dugan, 2006b). Institutions must heed the call by the public and the government for greater accountability and efficiency for institutional expenditures and outcomes. However, efficiency has not generally been ranked among the highest of values in the academic world (Kerr, 2001). Responding to the calls for greater accountability has been a struggle for many colleges and universities because of their preference for autonomy in conducting the operations of the institution. It can be especially challenging for public higher education institutions to balance demands for accountability and autonomy. Faculty see accountability efforts as additional bureaucracy. Faculty are opposed to government restrictions that they claim will decrease institutional autonomy. They are concerned about the possible loss of academic freedom and the possible emergence of standardized testing and prescribed curricula. On the other hand, external stakeholders state that the public interest is not served well if public colleges and universities enjoy complete autonomy with no public oversight. In order for higher education institutions to maintain autonomy, they need to provide evidence that they are meeting external stakeholder expectations for institutional effectiveness in reaching learning objectives and other institutional outcomes. Stakeholders expect to see evidence that students, in particular, receive the maximum yield possible from their personal, financial, and academic investment (Dugan, 2006b)."}, {"section_title": "Outcomes of Higher Education Institutions", "text": "The products of higher education -teaching, research, and service -are difficult to measure. Teaching is an experience good that can only be judged after it is consumed. As a result, observable signals of quality, including prestigious faculty or programs, or even price often influence the decisions of consumers (students). The consumers of the output are also inputs to the production process as well because students influence other students' experiences at the institution (Clotfelter, 1996;Martin, 2005). Despite the difficulty in measuring many of the outputs or outcomes of the institution, there are measures that can be used to evaluate the institutional performance of a college or university. Two of the most common measures of outcomes of a college or university are the faculty research productivity and student graduation rates of the institution. Student graduation rates are often used as a proxy for student learning (Dugan & Hernon, 2006) or what Bates (2000) referred to as the learning productivity of the institution. Both research productivity and graduation rates are of interest to external and internal stakeholders of the college or university. The calls for institutional effectiveness and accountability by stakeholders in higher education have become much louder since 2006 when the National Commission on the Future of Higher Education released its report to US Department of Education Secretary Margaret Spellings (now commonly referred to as the Spellings report, commission, or panel) regarding the future of U.S. higher education. This report called for increased accountability, efficiency, productivity, and transparency in respect to higher education costs. Developments that have taken place since this report was released include the move by hundreds of U.S. colleges and universities to start using studentachievement tests such as the Collegiate Learning Assessment (CLA) to measure student learning. The CLA measures cognitive growth provided by colleges as a source of evidence that the school is adding measurable value to students. The increased use of other standardized tests at colleges and universities seems likely to follow. Additionally, several major college groups have outlined plans to post to their Web sites specific performance related data to allow for direct comparisons between institutions (Basken, 2007), as called for in the Spellings Report. Based on what has happened since the release of this report, these types of requests by stakeholders will not go away any time soon and will impact the management of IT at colleges and universities as well (Camp & DeBlois, 2007). Faculty Outcomes. Research productivity is often used as a measure of faculty quality . Research expenditures are a common method of measuring research productivity (Ehrenberg & Hurst, 1998;Middaugh, 2001;Porter & Umbach, 2001;Volkwein & Malik, 1997;. Research productivity is of interest to the government and other stakeholders of colleges and universities because it is important to continued economic growth. For university administrators, research funding is viewed as the \"bread and butter of external revenues streams\u2026and plays an important role in research prestige systems\" (Slaughter & Rhoades, 2004, p. 185). The level of sponsored research activity is not only a measure of faculty quality, but is also frequently a determinant of institutional reputation (Duderstadt & Womack, 2003), particularly at research oriented institutions. Faculty research and scholarship influence the perceived faculty quality and academic reputation of an institution. In addition, faculty research and scholarship activity increase the attractiveness of the institution to prospective students. As a result, greater attractiveness of the institution also increases student enrollment and financial resources . Student Outcomes. Faculty talent and effort combine with student talent and effort to produce student outcomes. Student outcomes include academic success, student cognitive growth, graduation rates, the number and types of degrees awarded, degree productivity, and alumni giving rates (Basken, 2007;. Additional student outcomes include placement rates and full-time employment in the field following completion of a higher education program or degree, and licensure pass rates (Middaugh, 2001). These institutional outcomes are of great interest to institutions, policy makers, and/or the public. As a result, it becomes important for institutions to dedicate resources and institutional efforts to increase and/or enhance these student outcomes in the future. Linking IT to Student/Faculty Outcomes. Requests for innovation utilizing information technology for institutional improvement in terms of faculty and student outcomes often compete with demands to reduce expenditures on IT at many institutions. The constant concern for acquiring the necessary funding for IT can be illustrated by the results from the most recent annual EDUCAUSE survey of campus Chief Information Officers (CIOs) who ranked the funding of IT as the top IT strategic issue for 2007. In this annual survey, CIOS rank the top 10 strategic IT issues for the year. Not only was the funding of IT the top ranked IT strategic issue for 2007, the funding of IT has been the top ranked IT strategic issue for five times in the past eight years and in the other three years the funding of IT was ranked second (Camp & DeBlois, 2007). As a result, CIO's must expect more accountability for IT based decisions in the future. CIOS will need to show the value of IT to constituencies in exchange for funding support. Future increases in IT funding will likely depend on CIO's aligning IT with institutional priorities and explaining how the value of IT will help the institution realize these priorities and more importantly to meet stated faculty and student outcomes (Camp & DeBlois, 2007)."}, {"section_title": "Factors Influencing the Deployment of Resources in Higher Education", "text": "Higher education institutions have varying missions, control, governance, size, history, and wealth, each of which influences how an institution deploys its resources to compete to recruit faculty and students and additional resources for the institution. This also will impact an institution's ability to increase its prestige and institutional attractiveness . When studying higher education institutions it is important to understand how each of these characteristics impacts the deployment of institutional resources. Age, Size, and Wealth. Institutional age and size impact an institution's ability to attract, as well as the actual deployment of, institutional resources in attempts to acquire additional resources and increase institutional prestige and attractiveness. Older institutions have had a greater amount of time to build endowments and to increase the wealth of the institution through gifts of friends of the institution and alumni. Larger institutions have greater amounts of resources to use in competing for resources compared to smaller institutions . In addition, institutions with greater wealth, as measured by the endowment of the institution, tend to attract greater amounts of new resources and donations than institutions with smaller endowments (Martin, 2005). Institutional age, size, and wealth each have an impact on the deployment and acquisition of institutional resources, including IT resources. Competition for Resources. Higher educations institutions compete with other colleges and universities to acquire human and financial resources. Colleges and universities try to differentiate themselves by offering higher quality products or services such as nationally known faculty or excellent academic programs, better customer service or personalized attention, and other characteristics such as low student faculty ratios to entice faculty and students to work for or attend the institution (Rowley & Sherman, 2001). Technology is often a critical link to acquiring human and financial resources. The ability to deliver various services requiring technology, including educational technology capabilities, can determine an institution's staying power and is becoming more and more of a necessity for colleges and universities (Hunt, et al., 1997). Institutions invest in faculty and student recruitment by providing services and activities that make the institution more attractive. Institutions will deploy available resources to attract talented prospective students and faculty plus additional resources for the institution . Competitive pressures to attract top faculty and students are intense. Only a few colleges and universities would seem to be impervious to the need for additional financing yet the wealthiest institutions continue to announce and also to receive everlarger fundraising campaigns to further increase their wealth (Hossler, 2004). Higher education institutions pour money into recreation centers, food courts, student services, and amenities around campus to attract top faculty and students. Higher education institutions also spend money on continuing improvements in instructional technology which utilizes the information technology infrastructure of the campus (Brint, 2002). This competition for faculty and students requires the resources necessary to attract and retain high-quality faculty and high-quality students, including IT resources (Slaughter & Rhoades, 2004). Mission. Higher education institutions struggle with trying to be many things to many people. Colleges and universities are very complex. There are a wide variety of higher education institutions with missions to deliver teaching, research, and service. Each institution has a varying emphasis on each of those components based on the institution's mission and the populations each serves (Middaugh, 2001). This diversity of institutions is one of the strengths of American higher education. Each institution has unique characteristics, histories, cultures, and circumstances that have led the institution to develop its own mission statement and goals and that influence how the institution makes decisions on deploying its resources (Lucas, 1994). The mission of a higher education institution will affect how an institution deploys its resources and attempts to acquire additional resources to increase its institutional prestige and attractiveness . The mission will affect whether the institution focuses more on deploying resources toward research or teaching purposes. Therefore, the mission will play a big role in the strategic choices of colleges and universities (Rowley, et al., 1997). Research colleges and universities depend upon large resource bases and in most cases have a large resource base at their disposal (Rowley & Sherman, 2001). The research oriented university is a seedbed for innovation and change and must encourage the high-level thinking that is necessary for the institution to succeed over the long term. A research oriented university has a commitment to research and graduate study that instills open-mindedness to new ideas instead of looking to follow traditional ways of doing things (Rowley, et al, 1997). With research serving as the focus of the institution, the institution is more aggressive and open to adopting research oriented innovations, particularly computing and information resources important to research and graduate education (Getz, et al., 1997). Research colleges and universities tend to be bureaucratic in structure which makes it easier to adopt innovations demanded by senior faculty. These individuals have a great say in the adoption of innovations within the institution (Rowley & Sherman, 2001). A faculty with active researchers means there is a faculty with risk takers, exampled by regularly competing for grants as well as reaching out in search of the next great discovery. Research university faculty are more entrepreneurial and mobile and, for scholarly reasons, must stay informed about external matters. This means they are more likely to consider adopting initiatives and innovations because they are in tune with important external realities. The scholarly research university faculty are unlikely to become preoccupied with faculty politics and are unlikely to use faculty bureaucracy to deter innovations (Rowley, et al, 1997). Colleges and universities that are more teaching oriented than research oriented are likely to provide a more effective learning environment than research oriented universities. The priority of their focus and their commitment of resources and attention is different regarding these two activities (Duderstadt & Womack, 2003). As a result, teaching oriented institutions will be more likely to adopt teaching oriented innovations than research universities (Getz, et al., 1997). Colleges and universities that are more teaching oriented than research oriented typically do not have nearly the same amount of resources that research oriented institutions possess. The teaching institutions' missions are not as highly valued by the federal government, corporations, or donor groups and, as a result, their share of the overall resource base is proportionately smaller with lower salaries, smaller capital budgets, and less academic support funds. With students as more of a focus of the institution, teaching oriented institutions have had to become more marketing oriented to cater to students' needs. Teaching institutions have also had to become much more aware of the needs of the institutional constituency groups including state legislatures, employers, parents, alumni, and to become more responsive to the demands and needs of the society they serve in order to keep that support (Rowley & Sherman, 2001). In the middle of this focus on the adoption of technological innovations are the master's degrees awarding institutions which are often referred to as comprehensive institutions. Comprehensive (masters) institutions have a mission to try and be everything to everyone, with a mix of both a research and a teaching orientation. However, Rowley and Sherman (2001) stated that despite this dual orientation, comprehensive institutions typically lean toward making strategic decisions similar to those made by teaching oriented institutions. Therefore, for this study, comprehensive institutions were grouped with the teaching oriented institutions."}, {"section_title": "Influence of IT on Faculty and Student Recruitment", "text": "Faculty expect access to appropriate computer resources and equipment (Hunt, et al., 1997). Faculty expect to research in state of the art technology research labs and facilities and library and learning resources (Duderstadt, et al., 2002). Faculty also expect to have the computing capacity and other requisite technologies required to conduct research in their labs (Gunzburger & Wilgenbusch, 2007) as well as from their office computers. The requisite IT resources are often essential to allowing them to perform high powered and sophisticated research experiments (Duderstadt, et al., 2002). Financially, often times the awarding of government grants and funding requires a minimum infrastructure including IT infrastructure to already be in place in order for the institution and its faculty to have an opportunity to compete for the grant (Elish, 2005). Faculty recognize this factor and as a result look for institutions that have at least a minimum level of IT capacity, but are usually more attracted to institutions with the highest levels of computing and networking capacity already in place. Because top faculty bring in government and corporate research funds, foundation support, and raise prestige through their achievements (Brint, 2002) colleges and universities are willing to provide the necessary resources, including IT, to attract and retain top faculty. Students expect to live in residence halls with broadband Internet access and to find the latest technologies in the classrooms, state of the art fitness centers, and other country club caliber amenities on campus. Students are increasingly attracted to colleges and universities with clear commitments to providing sophisticated computing environments (Duderstadt, et al., 2002). Students' IT expectations will most likely only continue to increase the costs of providing instruction in higher education. \"As computersavvy, Internet-using, computer-game-playing youth become the new students, their expectations for the quality of instructional materials may increase the cost the way the cost of motion pictures increased -about 10 percent per year -to meet the expectations of the young audience\" (Farmer, 2004, p. 187). Research has shown that academic rankings and reputation are directly correlated with the selectivity of the institution (Duderstadt & Womack, 2003). Colleges and universities recognize that top students reinforce the standing of the institution and eventually contribute to the institution's economic well-being through their donations as alumni (Brint, 2002). Therefore, higher education institutions will continue to spend significant amounts on IT and other resources to attract and retain top students."}, {"section_title": "Reputation, Prestige, Institutional Attractiveness", "text": "One of the strengths of the American higher education system is that competitive forces stimulate public and private universities to seek out their competitive advantages (Newman & Couturier, 2001). Colleges and universities work hard to position themselves in a way that will maximize the reputation, prestige, and institutional attractiveness of the institution so that when an individual hears the name of a certain college or university they think of it in a certain way. To those that can afford it, the prestige of a college or university is often viewed as more important than the quality of the educational experience received by the student (Duderstadt & Womack, 2003). However, prestige does not necessarily equal educational quality and the two concepts may be relatively independent of each other. More prestigious institutions may not necessarily provide a better learning experience than other colleges and universities (Basken, 2007;Pascarella & Terenzini, 1991). Prestige has led to institutions focusing institutional resources and efforts on the inputs included in rankings of prestige, such as student enrollments, instead of on other important elements to the student's learning experience that are not measured in the rankings systems (Hossler, 2004). The impact of competition and market forces has also led to colleges and universities taking great efforts to market themselves through extensive \"branding\" campaigns in an attempt to stand out from the competition (Kirp, 2003). Branding and the terms \"marketization\" and \"commodification\" are becoming prevalent terms to describe these actions (Hossler, 2004). Brand names have been important for a long time to colleges and universities. This is evident with the social networks that have developed over time for students and alumni of the institution. These social networks were first created during experiences in college between fellow students and continue to be further developed after graduation during experiences with other alumni of the institution. These social networks, sometimes called \"good old boy\" ties, impact job, political, and other future opportunities for students and alumni of the institution. However, the concept of branding has become more important over the past few years because federal funding and private giving have become increasingly correlated with faculty reputation and college rankings, increasing the economic impact of the \"brand\" of the institution (Duderstadt & Womack, 2003). Focusing on what value is added by a college education is much more important to students than the backgrounds they bring with them, the resources on hand, and the prestige of the institution (Pascarella & Terenzini, 1991). When educational outcomes are more important than the backgrounds the students bring with them, administrators and faculty work toward enhancing the student and faculty activity in terms of output measures instead of focusing on increasing the input measures (Duderstadt & Womack, 2003;Middaugh, 2001). Unfortunately, prestige rankings are based more on the inputs than the outputs or outcomes and prestige definitely influences the behavior of administrators, faculty, students, and parents (Monks & Ehrenberg, 1999). In addition, the US News and World Report (USNWR) rankings actually have a more powerful influence on trustees, alumni, faculty, large donors, college presidents, provosts, and deans (Ehrenberg 2000(Ehrenberg , 2003Hossler, 2000;Monks & Ehrenberg, 1999;Slaughter & Rhoades, 2004) than on parents and students. However, rankings do significantly influence students and parents as well (Duderstadt & Womack, 2003). As a result, administrators may make decisions regarding information technology purchases and planning in pursuit of prestige as they see peer institutions making significant information technology purchases, or in hope of staying ahead of competitors. These decisions may involve connecting to the LambaRail or Internet2 high speed Internet connections, if institutions are willing to pay the significant fees required to connect to and utilize these private Internet connections (Elish, 2005); implementing new requirements that all freshmen purchase laptops before starting classes; providing cell phones for all faculty and students (Jaschik, 2006); or buying i-Pods for incoming students as Duke did for all of its incoming freshman students in 2005 (Read, 2005). Because funding agents recognize the importance of having fast research network connectivity available, technology purchases are often made to put institutions on equal footing with the best research institutions in the nation, in order to level the playing field for faculty in competing for grants (Elish, 2005). Prestige may not always be the operative objective in the decision, but it does play a role in decision making regarding IT purchases and decisions (Robbins, et. al, 1975). As Bowen's (1980) revenue theory suggests, there seems to be evidence that colleges and universities continue to raise all the money they can and spend all the money they raise in the quest for greater power, influence, and prestige. In this quest, many colleges and universities may make IT based decisions in an attempt to garner or at least maintain the power, influence, and prestige of the institution rather than acquiring IT resources with the intent to enhance the overall operations of the college or university."}, {"section_title": "Section 3: Impact of IT on Productivity and Adoption of IT in Higher Education", "text": "It is important to understand how IT has impacted productivity in higher education. In addition, it is important to recognize that for the most part higher education has been reticent to adopt new innovations. Possible reasons for this could have been resource constraints or perhaps the unproven nature of the innovation being considered for adoption. The following section will describe these elements in greater detail along with additional factors regarding the impact of IT decisions on colleges and universities."}, {"section_title": "IT and Productivity in Higher Education", "text": "The call for greater accountability in higher education and outcomes assessment will continue to have a profound impact on higher education in the future. Add to this the fact that information technology has become a major factor driving changes in the ways students learn and the way faculty teach and conduct research. The purpose of outcomes assessment is to produce change in prescribed areas and to ensure these changes are accomplished. The effect of both IT and outcomes assessment \"in the higher education environment is profound\" with \"their interconnection further compounding the changes within higher education\" (Jefferson, 2006, p. 273). No force has a greater potential to transform higher education than information technology (Brint, 2002). IT has not only transformed teaching and research, but has also transformed how colleges and universities are financed, managed, and who will be regarded as students and faculty (Duderstadt & Womack, 2003). Colleges and universities will need to be accountable for the use of their IT resources by relating the use of IT resources to outcomes of interest to both internal and external stakeholders. Two outcomes of great interest to stakeholders are graduation rates (Hernon & Dugan, 2006) and research productivity (Middaugh, 2001). In responding to the call for greater accountability, colleges and universities will need to prioritize the purchase of and ongoing support of technologies used for teaching, learning, and research by faculty and students (Dugan, 2002). Kerr (2001) suggested that this call for effectiveness in the use of resources \"will be perceived by many inside the university world as the best current definition of evil\" (p. 181). Whether or not this call for effectiveness is perceived as evil, higher education institutions will need to demonstrate effectiveness in the use of technology resources (Kiernan, 2006). With IT costs expected to continue to escalate significantly in the future, the funding of IT has become a key issue for colleges and universities to address for the foreseeable future (Camp & Dubloy, 2007). Unfortunately, as Bowen (1968) first noted, later reconfirmed by Clotfelter (1996) and Martin (2005), technology has not affected administrative productivity in the education \"industry\" like other sectors of the economy where IT has increased productivity in terms of increased efficiencies and cost savings in the operations of the institution. As Martin (2005) stated it is likely that higher education has just been inefficient in its employment of information technology. However, Clotfelter (1996) countered that computers had increased research productivity and also noted that the failure of computers and other innovations to bring about reductions in staffing did not mean that these reductions could not eventually occur. While IT costs are expected to only continue to escalate in the future (Camp & Dubloy, 2007), the cost of developing and providing quality online learning materials and the associated networking infrastructure are significant and has become a major capital expense for colleges and universities. Response to escalating IT costs has been 1) to greatly increase the number of students who use the instructional technologies to offset the significant costs of providing the online learning materials and infrastructure or 2) increase the revenues gained from utilizing the materials and/or the IT infrastructure (Farmer, 2004). This costing model requires a combination of increasing distance learning course offerings and/or expanding enrollments at the institution. Another approach to escalating costs for IT has been to join consortia in order to share the cost of making IT purchases. A consortium is a collaboration of any combination of educational institutions, government agencies, vendors, or non-profit organizations with the purpose of coordinating and facilitating networking activities, as well as other services (National Science Foundation, 2005). Consortia allow colleges and universities to share IT or other resources, make group IT purchases to lower IT costs, and/or to share and exchange knowledge or data. In addition, students are being asked to bear more of the burden of additional technology funding (Hirth, 2006). Students are increasingly being charged technology fees in addition to their tuition as a part of their educational costs to support the IT infrastructure, computer labs, and other IT resources of the institution. Many campuses are also requiring students to purchase their own laptops and/or hand held PDA or computer devices along with necessary software and electronic textbooks as a part of their educational programs of study. Although IT does not seem to lead to greater administrative productivity at colleges or universities, IT does provide many advantages to higher education institutions. IT is used in conducting outcomes assessment and to improve the quality of teaching (Jefferson, 2006). Educational technologies increase access for students by providing students greater flexibility to learn at their own pace from their own home while maintaining full time jobs. Bates (2000) stated that while IT is unlikely to reduce absolute costs of the institution, it can increase the learning productivity of an institution. He added that IT can improve the cost-effectiveness of college and university operations by allowing institutions to offer instruction to more and different students; by reducing or eliminating \"activities currently carried out by instructors that are best done by technology\" and thereby freeing up faculty \"for more productive use of their time\"; and by improving the \"quality of learning, either by enabling new skills and learning outcomes to be achieved or by enabling students to achieve existing learning goals more easily or quickly\" (p. 220). However, Bates warned that to increase cost-effectiveness in higher education will require more than just purchasing new technologies. Colleges and universities must make significant changes to teaching methods and the operations of the organization with the goal of identifying which activities IT should replace to benefit student learning. Pascarella and Terenzini (1991) declared that colleges and universities offer \"a setting in which the impetus and opportunities for change are substantial, perhaps unsurpassed by those of any other social institution\" (p. 59). With this in mind, Kerr (2001) stated that the major test of a modern college or university is how wisely and how quickly it is able to adjust to important new possibilities. However, higher education is more comfortable with sticking to its time-honored traditions and keeping its distance from the rest of society than with adopting innovations, including information technology (Keller, 1997)."}, {"section_title": "Resistance to Change and the Adoption of Innovations in Higher Education", "text": "Sticking to time-honored traditions will not work in today's society, for change is the rule and not the exception. Because the world is changing, to endure, higher education institutions must change their perceptions and must always be flexible (Drucker, 1995). However, within the political systems on many campuses, distrust frequently exists between faculty and administrators (Birnbaum, 1988). Nevertheless, a collaborative change effort, though it clearly takes more time, is more likely to be successful and bring others on board (Lucas, 2000). The resistance to change and adoption of innovations often gets lost in the battle for resources within colleges and universities. This battle often takes place between academic affairs and other facets of the institution not tied directly to academic operations. Academic affairs typically will win in the political battles for resources when competing against other areas of the college or university. This is evidenced by the long tradition of cutting student affairs or the physical plant operations whenever there is a bump in the steady flow of funding (Rowley, et al, 1997). At times, IT has also become a target for cost cutting efforts at colleges or universities. In addition, the inertia of a college or university caused by the large capital investment on campus combined with the high degree of specialization represented by the physical plant makes it difficult to avoid the costs of operating and maintaining that capital investment or moving in a different strategic direction (Clotfelter, 1996). Faculty are key in the adoption of educational innovation. They design the curriculum, offer the courses, and certify competency as prerequisite to the degree. If faculty do not see a need to adopt IT or some other innovation, the actual adoption of the innovation will become very difficult. In addition, the adoption of an innovation requires both financial and human resources. The necessary condition for an innovation's success is the commitment of resources, especially financial resources (Lu, 2000)."}, {"section_title": "Prior Research on the Adoption of Innovations in Higher Education", "text": "In perhaps the most in depth and most quoted study to date of the adoption of innovations in higher education, Getz, Siegried, & Anderson (1997) surveyed 238 colleges and universities in the US to identify the adoption rate of 30 innovations in six categories of innovations: 1) curriculum (advanced placement accepted, interdisciplinary major, formal study abroad, computer science major, women's study course), 2) classrooms (language laboratory, infrared photo spectrometer, organized audiovisual service, video projector, wireless microphone), 3) student life (coed residence hall, summer orientation, video tape used in admissions, on-line registration, debit card), 4) libraries (technology for access, cataloging, circulation, and management, on-line database searching, optical disk, automated circulation system, automated public catalog), 5) computing (time sharing computing, student microcomputer laboratory, laser printer, digital telephone switch, inter-building data network), and 6) financial services (tuition payment plan, external endowment manager, capital budget, fixed payout from endowment, choice in fringe benefit average). Adoption in this study was defined dichotomously, either the institution had the resource on campus or it did not during a specific year. Each institution was asked to identify the specific year that the institution first adopted the innovation. This data was used to make comparisons regarding the adoption rates and characteristics of early adopters of each of the innovations. Getz, et al., (1997) found that on average it took about 26 years from the time the innovation first became available to eventually make the decision to adopt the 30 innovations included in their study. With most of the innovations, higher education institutions took about three times longer to adopt innovations than the private sector. Getz, et al., (1997) also found that innovations in libraries and computing, which were all based on electronic systems, were adopted about twice as fast as the other innovations taken together. In short, IT related innovations diffuse much more quickly than other innovations in higher education. Interestingly, financial innovations were adopted most slowly even though administrators could potentially make the decisions to adopt financial innovations at a much quicker pace as there is no need for the time consuming consensus building process it takes to make decisions where faculty are involved such as with curriculum. Getz, et al., (1997) found mixed results based on the institutional characteristics of the college or university and the particular type of innovation being adopted. Overall, larger institutions were more likely to be earlier adopters. They hypothesized that research and doctoral universities would be more aggressive in adopting research related innovations than comprehensive institutions and liberal arts institutions would be more aggressive in adopting instructional innovations than comprehensive institutions. Their study confirmed these hypotheses. Overall, Getz, et al., (1997) found that research universities were more likely to adopt innovations than institutions with other missions. Getz, et al., (1997) also looked to see what impact six attributes of the innovation had on the adoption of the innovation. They looked to see whether: 1) electronic devices, 2) boards of trustees making the innovation decision, 3) faculty making the innovation decision, 4) visibility of the innovation, 5) significant capital outlay, or 6) external vendor influence or promotion significantly impacted the adoption rate of these 30 innovations. Of these six innovation attributes, the regression results confirmed that only innovations that depend on electronics were adopted more rapidly. This confirms the importance of studying the adoption of IT in higher education and building on the work of Getz, Siegfried, & Anderson (1997)."}, {"section_title": "Impact of IT decisions on Colleges and Universities", "text": "While IT holds potential for positively impacting research productivity and learning productivity (Clotfelter, 1996;Bates, 2000), colleges and universities intent on heeding the growing call for institutional effectiveness and accountability must be aware of previous IT related failures as well. Technology is expensive yet has a very short lifetime. Institutions poured a fantastic amount of money into multimedia teaching centers in the 1990s but now cannot figure out what to do with them. If an institution simply adds technology to what it is already doing, the institution will experience what Twigg called the \"no significant difference phenomenon\" (Young, 2005, p. B12). In other words, the institution will be doing basically the same thing it was doing before purchasing the technology. However, the institution will also have bolted on additional costs of purchasing, maintaining, and supporting the new technology. Technology decisions, good or bad, often last years. Making IT decisions without careful planning can cost an institution a significant amount of money and negatively impact the institution for an extended period of time. Many decisions such as construction or decisions related to the curriculum of the institution may have a very lasting effect on the campus. Balancing new opportunities against previous investments is a challenge. Buechner (2005) stated the biggest challenge facing college campuses today may be that so many new things can be embraced that it is difficult to know when to make the plunge and when to hang back and let a technology mature and prove its worth. This requires focusing on what is really needed for the work of the institution rather than on what is new or just possible."}, {"section_title": "Section 4: Discussion of Research Question Variables", "text": "The theoretical model for analyzing IT use for institutional effectiveness is based on the TOE framework (Tornatzky & Fleischer, 1990) which looks at the technological, organizational, and environmental circumstances of an organization. Each of these three contexts influences the process by which an institution adopts, implements, and uses technological innovations. The technological context \"describes both the existing technologies in use and new technologies relevant to the firm\" (Zhu & Kraemer, 2005, p. 63). The organizational context \"refers to descriptive measures about the organization such as scope, size, and the amount of slack resources available internally\" (Zhu & Kraemer, 2005, p. 63). The environmental context is the \"arena in which a firm conducts its business--its industry, competitors, and dealings with government\" (Tornatzky & Fleischer, 1990, p. 154). Rogers (1995) also linked the importance of studying the technological characteristics (including the technical knowledge or expertise of a firm) with studying the internal characteristics (including size and uncommitted resources available) and the external characteristics of the organization."}, {"section_title": "Technological Context", "text": "The technological context of an institution affects the organization's adoption of, implementation, and influence the use of technological innovations (Zhu & Kraemer, 2005). The technological context includes the IT infrastructure and skilled personnel, IT policies and strategic planning, and training practices of the college or university. Technology competence is the ability of the institution to utilize \"both the existing technologies in use and new technologies relevant to the firm\" (Zhu & Kraemer, 2005, p. 63) within this technological context. Each of these factors will influence the adoption and use of innovations in higher education (Getz, et al., 1997;Rowley, et al., 1997). The relevant technologies measured in this study were the IT capacity and IT capabilities of the institution. Hence secondary hypothesis 1: IT capacity (Internet2 bandwidth, Internet1 bandwidth, maximum speed on network, maximum speed through any Internet Connection, and number of high performance computers on campus) and IT capability (receive bandwidth from consortia, presence of dark fiber connected to Internet service provider, presence of dark fiber to connected to campus buildings) indicators will positively impact the technological context and IT use. Technology Competence. The technological competence of an organization influences the organization's ability to monitor technological change and develop its core products, which in higher education would be related to the creation and sharing of knowledge. Torrisi (1998) described the importance of the technological competence of an organization. Technological competency allows an organization to coordinate different skills and technologies critical for its growth because the development of complex products requires the integration of different knowledge sources. Organizations develop internal information and knowledge which aids in the accumulation of organizational capabilities. Torrisi (1998) stated that these accumulative capabilities 1) reduce the costs of information processing, to combine different types of knowledge, and to organize learning activities; 2) are collective and nurtured in the organizational framework; and 3) cannot be embodied in, nor be portable by individual employees. As a result, these organizational capabilities are difficult for competitors to imitate because they are embedded in the routines and experience of individuals within the organization. The technological capabilities of an institution consist of infrastructure, human resources, and knowledge (Bharadwaj, 2000;Mata et. al, 1995). For this study, technology competence consists of the technology infrastructure and capability of human resources to utilize the information architecture (Mata, et. al., 1995). The technological competence is reflected not just by physical assets but also by complementary human resources (Steiss, 2003). The technological infrastructure combined with the skilled humans to support it is vital to exploiting the IT capabilities of a college or university (Evans & Nation, 2000). Collins (2001) found that the best companies tend to attract the best talent and over time begin to pull away from the rest of their competitors. Colleges and universities must also attract the best talent to better compete against rival institutions. IT Infrastructure and Personnel Skills. In order for a college or university to take advantage of new opportunities, the institution must have adequate technology capacity in place as well as skilled personnel (Steiss, 2003). Therefore, colleges and universities must attract top faculty to the institution and provide training and the supportive environment necessary to exploit the IT resources of the institution. The IT resources are ultimately just a tool; without talented faculty, students, and staff to utilize the IT resources, institutional effectiveness will not be realized.\nThe evaluation of the fit of this initial structural model with the combined organizational and environmental context factor and a structural coefficient of \"1\" on the structural parameter connecting the technological context factor to the institutional effectiveness factor showed that the chi square was significant with a chi square of 119.093 and 42 degrees of freedom (df), which was not good, but with a large sample size this was not unexpected. The NFI of .686, TLI of .689, and CFI of .762 all indicated a poor model fit since they were much lower than .90. Furthermore, the RMSEA was .105 which indicated a poor model fit since any model fit above .08 indicates an increasingly poor model fit. Removing other technological context indicators did not produce a significantly better admissible model solution. Therefore, this model was used as the final institutional effectiveness structural model for teaching oriented institutions. Interpretation of Results. When interpreting the results for the final institutional effectiveness model for teaching oriented institutions, it was important to be cautious in interpreting these results since the structural parameter connecting the technological context factor to the institutional effectiveness factor had to have a regression weight (a regression weight of \"1\" was used) in order to obtain an admissible solution to this model because the error term for the learning productivity indicator had an extremely negative variance. With this in mind when interpreting the results, the structural coefficient for the combined organizational and environmental context factor (.042 p value) on institutional effectiveness was significant at the .05 level (see Table 4.22: IE Structural Standardized Regression Weights: Teaching Institutions). Since a regression weight was used, the significance of the structural coefficient for the technological context factor was not available (NA). The technological context factor and combined organizational and environmental (OE) context factor were not correlated (.-01). The low slightly negative correlation between these factors along with the much higher structural coefficient (.899) for the OE context factor compared to the technological context factor (.103) illustrated that the organizational and environmental context was much more important when making decisions related to the institutional effectiveness of a college or university in terms of producing research and learning at teaching oriented institutions. Note: P value not available (NA) since regression weight for structural parameter was set to 1 by researcher. Similar to the TOE measurement model, the number of high performance computers on campus (.311 p value) and maximum speed of the network (.190 p value) did not have significant standardized regression weights at the .05 level (see Table 4.23: IE Standardized Regression Weights: Teaching Institutions). Additionally, unlike the TOE measurement model this time the dark fiber connections to an ISP (.069 p value) was not significant at the .05 level. All other indicators, including the learning productivity indicator (.015 p value) for the institutional effectiveness latent variable were significant at the .05 level. The research productivity and bandwidth to consortium indicators had to have regression weights of \"1\" for this model to work so a significance value was not available. Significance tests for the research productivity and the bandwidth to consortium indicator were not available (NA) because these indicator parameters also had to have regression weights of \"1\" in order to produce an admissible model solution. Note: Not available (NA) since regression weight for structural parameter was set to 1. The combined organizational and environmental context factor (.899) had a much greater standardized total effect than the technological factor (.103) on the institutional effectiveness factor in the teaching oriented institution model (see Table 4.24: IE Standardized Total Effects: Teaching Institutions). This highlighted the importance of the organizational and environmental context to teaching oriented institutions when making decisions related to the research and learning productivity of teaching oriented institutions. Not completely unexpected, the results for both indicators of the institutional effectiveness endogenous latent variable were very dissimilar. Research productivity was slightly positive (.173) while learning productivity was highly negative (-.896). Further analysis showed, competitive pressure led to the highly negative learning productivity result. For the exogenous factors, the two Internet capacity indicators (Internet2 bandwidth at .967 and Internet1 bandwidth at .535) all had high standardized total effects on the technological context factor. The bandwidth from a consortium indicator (.372) had a more moderate standardized total effect. The other technological context indicators had low standardized total effects on the technological context factor. For the combined organizational and environmental (OE) context factor, the competitive pressure had a very highly negative (-.902) standardized total effect while size (.301) and regulatory support (.486) both had moderately positive standardized total effects on the factor. As stated previously, this highly negative standardized total effect of competitive pressure on the OE context factor was why the learning productivity indicator for institutional effectiveness was -.896. This illustrated how significantly the learning productivity or graduation rate of teaching oriented institutions was impacted by competitive pressure in terms of the prestige of the institution. As prestige fell, the graduation rate would fall at almost an identical standardized rate for this sample of teaching oriented institutions. The standardized indirect effects illustrated how much the two exogenous factors affected both endogenous indicators for institutional effectiveness in teaching oriented institutions (see Table 4.25: IE Standardized Indirect Effects: Teaching Institutions). The standardized indirect results were very different for both exogenous factors on both the research productivity and learning productivity indicators. The organizational and environmental (OE) context factor had a standardized indirect effect of .156 on research productivity while the technological context factor had a much smaller almost negligible standardized indirect effect of .018. In relation to learning productivity, the organizational and environmental context factor had a standardized indirect effect of -.805 while the technological context factor had a much smaller standardized indirect effect of -.093. In both cases, the OE context factor almost completely explained the research and learning productivity of teaching oriented institutions. Just as with the research oriented institutions, multiple regression was used to illustrate the direct effects of each exogenous indicator on the research productivity indicator and also on the learning productivity indicator for teaching oriented institutions. With per capita research productivity serving as the dependent variable, size was the only indicator of the organizational and environmental context factor that was significant (see Table 4.26: IE Indicator Research Productivity Regression: Teaching Institutions). Similar to research oriented institutions, size had a negative effect on research productivity. As size increased by one unit, the research productivity decreased by -.282. This was likely because the per capita research productivity used in this study controlled for size by dividing research expenditures by number of FTE faculty at the institution. This result also may have happened because larger public teaching oriented institutions are not as likely to be focused on research compared to smaller more prestigious institutions which have a greater research focus. For the technological context factor, the number of high performance computers on campus was the only significant predictor. High performance computing (.296) is very important to conducting sophisticated research and positively affected per capita research productivity in teaching oriented institutions. This model explained 15 percent of the variance for per capita research productivity for teaching oriented institutions. With learning productivity (undergraduate graduation rate) serving as the dependent variable, obtaining bandwidth from a consortium was the only significant predictor for the technological context factor (see Table 4.27: IE Indicator Learning Productivity Regression: Teaching Institutions). Competitive pressure was the only significant predictor for the organizational and environmental context factor. The finding that competitive pressure in terms of prestige had a high positive standardized effect of .683 on learning productivity was predictable due to the high correlation between these two indicators . The slightly negative effect of obtaining bandwidth from a consortium (-.129) on learning productivity can be explained by examining the correlations of obtaining bandwidth from a consortium and the other exogenous indicators as well as the exploratory factor analysis results. The highest positive correlation between obtaining bandwidth from a consortium was Internet2 bandwidth (.40) followed by size (.34). Obtaining bandwidth from a consortium also loaded strongest (.591 loading) on the first factor that included the Internet2 (.891 loading), Internet1 (.752 loading), and size (.476 loading). In short, size and obtaining Internet2 and Internet1 bandwidth from a consortium are correlated and as size increases this often has a negative effect on the learning productivity in terms of the undergraduate graduation rate of an institution (Pascarella &Terenzini, 1991). The regression results may also explain why learning productivity was such a highly negative indicator of the institutional effectiveness factor in the institutional effectiveness structural model for teaching oriented institutions. Competitive pressure had a highly negative standardized direct effect on the organizational and environmental (OE) context factor (-.886). With the OE context factor dominating this model (evidenced by a much higher standardized direct effect of .90 on institutional effectiveness compared to .10 for the technological context factor) and with competitive pressure having a much higher standardized direct effect on the OE context, competitive pressure clearly influenced the learning productivity indicator for the teaching oriented institution institutional effectiveness structural model. More prestigious institutions attract students who are typically better prepared for college with higher test scores and grades and have greater financial support and resources and as a result have higher graduation rates than less prestigious institutions . Therefore, as prestige goes down so would the learning productivity rate in teaching oriented institutions."}, {"section_title": "IT Policies and Strategic", "text": "Planning. An important piece of the technological competence of a college or university is its policies and systems governing decisions from capital budgeting and equipment selection to organizational structure. Human resource policies and organizational design are other important factors. Although there is often a tendency to focus on quantifiable issues and specific inputs or output measures, these other factors are critical to organizational success. Several studies in the private sector have found that the majority of performance differences are often attributed to differences in policies, procedures, and systems rather than structural variables such as size and resources available (Hayes, et al., 2005). In addition, an organization's culture provides important clues to its receptiveness to adopt an innovation. Organizations comfortable with risk taking are more likely to be receptive to change (Steiss, 2003). Colleges and universities also must plan for rapidly growing needs of users for more bandwidth and capacity in the future. Ways to do this include putting significantly more network power into new buildings being constructed than will be required of users at the beginning because it is cheaper to put in more capacity during construction than to add it later. This unused network infrastructure is known as dark fiber. Many colleges and universities add capacity generously when they have the chance. For example, in order to maintain network growth, one large research university maintains 30 percent more capacity or dark fiber than it is currently using (Millard, 2006). This allows the institution to maintain control of the design of the campus network and to better manage network growth and expansion in preparation for the needs of users in the future. Institutions that have acquired dark fiber connected to their Internet Service Provider (ISP) and connected to their buildings will have greater ability to rapidly expand capacity as demands for IT and use of IT rises in the future. The technology competence is particularly important when implementing innovations, especially in terms of the introduction of new technology. Often times the institution \"assumes that the effects of technology are independent of the organization structure and processes in which the technology is embedded\". However, \"research has shown that while investments in information technology often are associated with higher productivity, complementary changes in organizational processes and practices often are more important, and more difficult, to achieve\" (Steiss, 2003, p. 12). In addition, the directions of research and development activities and search for new knowledge at the organization level is influenced by the organization's past experience and its stock of knowledge which may give established organizations some cumulative advantages to newcomers (Torrisi, 1998). This means that colleges or universities with a greater technology competence will be more likely to adopt and more fully exploit new technologies than those with a lower technological competence. IT Training. The ability of faculty and staff to effectively use the IT resources will be a key success factor to exploiting the capabilities of IT resources. An understanding of how to conduct sophisticated research becomes important to take advantage of the capabilities of IT. Training faculty and staff in how to apply the available technology through carefully constructed transition workshops and training programs is critical (Steiss, 2003). Training must be kept current with users alerted of important changes to the content or interface and shown how to utilize the IT resources after any change is made (Foster, 2000). The faculty or researchers must receive training in the use of information technology in order to best utilize the IT infrastructure for research and for teaching. Staff development is vital to equip academic staff with new skills needed to utilize IT resources (Staley, 2000). Training is essential to ensure that staff and faculty have the right skills and knowledge to utilize technologies to perform tasks effectively. Training must be planned for from the beginning, tied to the needs of the organization, and budgeted for from the outset (O'Donovan, 2000). Staff and faculty development enable a college or university to retain valuable people and keep them current. Training helps those involved to become more fully indoctrinated to any change process and also understand how to utilize the technology systems in place (Steiss, 2003). Faculty development can also aid in changing attitudes of faculty toward adopting the technology and will more likely lead to realizing the benefits that come from using the technology. However, many colleges and universities assign training costs a low priority in the budget. Understanding and addressing training in a more strategic manner is of benefit to the college or university and the human resources of the campus (Rowley & Sherman, 2001). This also allows the institution to focus on the most effective ways to utilize the information technology resources to find information that is needed (O' Donovan, 2000). The use of technology provides a strong platform for faculty development and renewal. Faculty training on the uses of IT is important if they are expected to adopt and more fully utilize the technologies in their teaching and research efforts. However, technical support personnel are also very important to more fully exploit the use of the technology. Using graduate students to perform technical tasks and duties can offer a less expensive short term advantage, but is no substitute for proper technical training of staff. To use technology successfully requires the college or university to provide adequate technology support staff. Initially, it may appear to be more expensive to provide technical support staff. However, it actually can be cheaper to provide necessary technical support because it frees up expensive faculty time for research and serving as subject matter experts, while support staff take care of technical fixes and details (Bates, 2000). Technological Context Summary. The technology competence refers to the ability to utilize \"both the existing technologies in use and new technologies relevant to the firm\" (Zhu & Kraemer, 2005, p. 63). Colleges or universities wishing to more fully exploit their IT capacity and IT capabilities must have the technology infrastructure of the institution as well as the skilled personnel to do so. The institution must have supportive policies, procedures, and systems in place, including an information strategy, to update the IT infrastructure and keep it current. Training for faculty and staff is also very important. Institutions possessing greater IT capacity and IT capabilities will have a greater technological context in place. Based on TOE theory, the greater technological context will lead to greater IT usage that in turn will generate institutional effectiveness in terms of the research productivity and the learning productivity of the institution (see primary hypothesis 1)."}, {"section_title": "Organizational Context", "text": "The organizational context of an institution affects the organization's adoption of, implementation, and use of technological innovations (Zhu & Kraemer, 2005). The organizational context refers to the size and the potential financial commitment to IT of the organization. Both of these factors will affect the adoption and use of innovations including IT in higher education (Getz, et al., 1997;Rowley, et al., 1997). Size. The size of a college or university will affect the adoption of innovations in higher education. For this study, institutional size is represented by the total FTE undergraduate student enrollment of the institution. Testing of secondary hypothesis 2, \"Size in terms of enrollment will be a positive indicator of the organizational context and IT use\" will provide information about the influence of institutional size on IT use. Institutions with large enrollments have greater amounts of resources to use in competing for resources when compared to smaller institutions. Larger institutions can spread out the significant fixed costs of adopting an innovation over more students, have greater access to capital, and may be better able to moderate risk (Getz, et al., 1997;Rowley, et al. 1997). Larger organizations have consistently been found to be more innovative than smaller organizations. Rogers (1995) reasoned that this may be because size is probably a surrogate measure for total resources, slack resources, and the technical expertise of employees. Rogers said that these lurking variables may be the cause of this positive relationship between larger size and the innovativeness of an organization. On the other hand, smaller institutions may be less bureaucratic and can respond more flexibly to opportunities. The greater structural inertia of larger organizations tends to make larger institutions less agile and flexible than smaller institutions. As a result, greater structural inertia could slow down the organizational usage of IT in a larger institution (Duderstadt & Womack, 2003;Torrisi, 1998). Zhu and Kraemer (2005) confirmed this with the finding that in the retail industry larger organizations tend to achieve a lesser extent of IT usage than smaller organizations. However, in higher education, the difference in extent of IT usage between larger institutions and smaller institutions may vary from what Zhu and Kraemer (2005) found in their study of the retail industry. Supported by the empirical work of Getz, et al., (1997), long time higher education consultants Rowley, Lujan, and Dolence (1997) made the case that larger institutions would be more innovative which would lead to a greater extent of IT usage than in smaller institutions. Larger institutions have more IT options available to them and greater resources available to them than smaller institutions. Larger universities have greater numbers of graduate programs and graduate students that provide a significant amount of teaching assistance as well as other student support resources that free up faculty to do other things. As a result, faculty at larger institutions have more time to be entrepreneurs and are more likely to be revenue generators in the form of consulting on projects and grants. These collaborative activities give the faculty members a better sense of how external forces affect the institution as well as the individual faculty member. Also, faculty at larger institutions are less likely to become bogged down in faculty governance and faculty processes that often impede the adoption of an innovation (Rowley & Shirman, 2001). These factors would lead to the belief that larger universities would be more likely to achieve a greater usage of IT than smaller colleges and universities. An argument for smaller universities being more likely to adopt innovations comes from long time university president/administrators Duderstadt and Womack (2003) who state that larger universities have authority too widely dispersed to make quick decisions important in taking advantage of the rapid development and evolution of IT. On the other hand, long time higher education consultants Rowley and Sherman (2001) counter that smaller public institutions have smaller resource bases, generally place less emphasis on research so they receive fewer research dollars, and are more dependent on state appropriations which constrains them because of the fluctuations in state taxes and interests. Smaller institutions also live in the shadow of the flagship and larger state universities unless alumni or other friends of the university happen to be in leadership positions and influence legislators to prioritize resources in favor of the smaller public institution (Rowley, et al, 1997). In brief, larger institutions would be more likely to achieve a greater extent of use of IT than smaller institutions. Based on TOE theory, size will serve as a positive indicator for IT usage. Potential Financial Commitment to IT. For this study, financial commitment is defined as the potential ability of the institution to spend to acquire resources including IT with potential financial commitment to IT represented by the total expenditures of the institution. Secondary hypothesis 3 (Potential financial commitment to IT will be a positive indicator of the organizational context and IT use) will explore the relationship between potential financial commitment to IT on IT use. Financial resources and commitment are another important component in the study of innovation in organizations (Iacovou, et. al, 1995;Zhu & Kraemer, 2005). The necessary condition for an innovation's success is the commitment of resources, especially financial resources (Lu, 2000). Institutional resources provide the basics for all campus activity with money attached in varying amounts to the priorities of the institution (Hunt, et al., 1997). Insufficient quality resources and funding becomes a significant obstacle to realizing institutional effectiveness in research and teaching (Foster, 2000). The college or university budget is the \"single most powerful controller of activity there is on campus\" (Rowley & Sherman, 2001, p. 174). As a result, only the programs and services that receive the necessary resources will survive. A lack of resources can prevent campuses not only from developing new initiatives but, in some cases, from maintaining current efforts. Adequate financial resources must be available before many opportunities can be undertaken (Hunt, et al., 1997). Every institution has limited financial resources. Increasing the capital resource base of a college or university provides the institution with more leverage and a greater ability to take advantage of important opportunities (Rowley & Sherman, 2001). In relation to IT, additions to the IT capacity and the maintenance of the current IT infrastructure of the institution come from the total annual expenditures of the institution. The maintenance of the IT infrastructure is a growing annual expense of colleges and universities (Duderstadt, et al., 2002). The IT capacity of an institution represents several years of expenditures on IT infrastructure over time. Institutions must dedicate a significant amount of money from these total annual expenditures to maintain, update, or expand the IT capacity of the institution which is critical to survival in the knowledge economy (Duderstadt, et al., 2002). Institutions with larger annual expenditures will have greater ability to allocate and spend new money for IT related purposes. Hence the total expenditures of the institution define the potential financial resources available to spend on IT to not only maintain the current IT capacity and infrastructure but also to take advantage of new technological opportunities available to the institution. With TOE theory serving as the guide, the potential financial commitment to IT will be a positive indicator for IT usage. Organizational Context Summary. The organizational context \"refers to descriptive measures about the organization such as scope, size, and the amount of slack resources available internally\" (Zhu & Kraemer, 2005, p. 63). The size of a college or university is an important factor to consider. Although institutions may have similar size, purpose, and scope, the annual budget will indicate the values and priorities of the institution (Hunt, et al., 1997). Sufficient financial resources dedicated to IT helps organizations obtain these necessary resources and develop them into superior functionalities (Zhu & Kraemer, 2005). Larger institutions with a greater potential financial ability to commit to IT based on the total expenditures available to the institution will be more likely to achieve a greater extent of IT usage. In turn, the organizational context based on these two indicators will positively impact IT use and lead to greater institutional effectiveness in terms of the research productivity and the learning productivity of the institution (see primary hypothesis 2)."}, {"section_title": "Environmental Context", "text": "The environmental context of an institution affects the organization's adoption of, implementation, and use of technological innovations (Zhu & Kraemer, 2005). The environmental context refers to the competitive environment and regulatory support of the college or university. Both of these factors will affect the adoption and use of innovations including IT in higher education (Getz, et al., 1997;Rowley, et al., 1997). Competitive Environment. Competitive pressure is a driver for innovation (Zhu & Kraemer, 2005). Institutions of higher education face fierce competitive pressure from other colleges and universities for reputation and prestige (Newman & Couturier, 2001). According to Volkwein and Sweitzer (2006), the prestige of an institution can be measured for research purposes by using the peer score of the US News and World Report (USNWR). For this study, competitive pressure is the pressure received by the institution from other institutions to innovate and was represented by the prestige of the institution as measured by the U.S. News & World Report (USNWR) annual rankings of colleges and universities. Secondary hypothesis 4 (competitive pressure in terms of prestige will be a positive indicator of the environmental context and IT use) will test the competition to IT use relationship. The prestige of a college or university is often viewed as more important than the quality of the educational experience received by the student (Duderstadt & Womack, 2003). Prestige rankings influence the behavior of alumni, trustees, administrators, faculty, students, and parents (Ehrenberg 2000(Ehrenberg , 2003Hossler, 2000;Monks & Ehrenberg, 1999;Slaughter & Rhoades, 2004). The impact of competition and market forces has led to colleges and universities making great efforts to market themselves through \"branding\" campaigns in an effort to stand out from the competition (Kirp, 2003). Furthermore, colleges and universities with greater prestige may be better able to take risks and withstand economic shocks or downturns (Getz, et al., 1997;Martin, 2005). In the corporate world, competitive pressure serves as a driver for innovation (Zhu & Kraemer, 2005). In the case of higher education, the prestige of an institution may serve as a competitive driver but also as a deterrent for innovation (Kirp, 2003). Teaching institutions will typically have less prestige than research oriented institutions since rankings and reputation are based significantly on the research productivity of the institution ). Yet teaching institutions are more likely to adopt instructional innovations (Kirp, 2003). For example, despite having significantly less financial resources, with their focus on teaching and learning community colleges are typically leaders in adopting instructional innovations including distance learning technologies (Bower & Hardy, 2004). Greater prestige may also lead the institution to manage its resources more conservatively because there is less reason to look for new opportunities (Getz, et al., 1997). Nevertheless, as Bowen's (1980) revenue theory suggests, there seems to be evidence that colleges and universities continue to raise all the money they can and spend all the money they raise in the quest for greater power, influence, and prestige. In this quest, many colleges and universities may make IT based decisions in competition against rivals in an attempt to garner or at least maintain the power, influence, and prestige of the institution rather than acquiring IT resources with the intent to enhance the overall operations of the college or university. Competitive pressures to increase prestige will serve as a driver for innovation with research institutions working to identify ways to outperform competitors by increasing their research productivity (Kirp, 2003) especially since in these institutions' resources are skewed toward the fulfillment of research agendas rather than undergraduate education (Rowley & Sherman, 2001). Research has also shown that academic rankings and reputation are directly correlated with the selectivity of the institution which makes the stakes for the best students even greater (Duderstadt & Womack, 2003). The literature suggests that institutions with greater prestige will receive greater competitive pressure which will positively impact greater IT use in the institution. Regulatory Support. For this study, regulatory support is the degree of governance/control and regulation for the institution. Lower governance/control represents greater regulatory support . Secondary hypothesis 5 is: Regulatory support will be a positive indicator of the environmental context and IT use. Colleges and universities are influenced by a number of parties which impose regulations and controls that affect innovation diffusion. The federal government has a regulatory influence on the adoption of innovations. For nearly all research colleges and universities in the United States, the US government is a major if not the major source for research funding as well as for financial aid for students. As a result, the US government influences how this money is spent, which will influence the strategic direction of a campus (Dugan, 2006b;. This is particularly true related to research. Funding decisions by the federal government to fund or not to fund certain research areas would impact a college or university that had developed expertise in a line of research that the government decided to cut off or reduce in funding (Rowley & Sherman, 2001). State regulation can also influence the adoption of innovation. States significantly control the degree of autonomy of colleges or universities (Dugan, 2006b;. This loss of strategic freedom is offset by the significant state allocations that support well over half of most public college or university budgets. State governments have considerable influence over the strategic direction and mission of public institutions so each campus has a reduced sphere of strategic freedom, and can change that sphere only by engaging in significant political actions (Rowley & Sherman, 2001). Consequently, another significant regulatory influence comes in the form of whether the institution is private or public. Making decisions concerning the use and planning of IT resources in a college and university may differ based on whether the institution is a public or private college or university (Getz, et al., 1997). Public colleges and universities have less control of what strategic opportunities they can pursue or other decisions in relation to the future deployment of their resources than private institutions do. Public colleges and universities must serve the purposes that have been outlined either implicitly or explicitly by state authorities which require them to make strategic decisions within the context set for them by the state. Public institutions face the challenge that comes from competing directly against other state colleges and universities for funding. In addition, public institutions compete with and often lose out to other state agencies for funding (Rowley & Sherman, 2001). Public universities face serious challenges to making IT decisions because they are \"accountable to public authority and therefore averse to risk, and IT is an area in which risk and success are closely linked\" (Duderstadt & Womack, 2003, p. 71)."}, {"section_title": "Private colleges and universities face challenges with making decisions", "text": "concerning what strategic opportunities they can pursue or decisions regarding the future deployment of their resources, including IT resources. Private colleges and universities may be inhibited by a tradition of service or religious obligation that limits their ability to seize opportunities available because of shifts in demand by the general population (Rowley, et al, 1997;. For example, if a private institution is controlled by a religious organization this may limit what the institution would or could do regarding using IT resources to provide distance education or utilizing IT in other ways because the religious organization determines such actions or uses of IT contradict its religious beliefs or ideology. Private colleges and universities are also facing greater competition for gifts and endowments from other schools and organizations seeking philanthropic dollars. This makes it more difficult to raise adequate gifts or fund endowments that could be used to support IT initiatives (Rowley & Sherman, 2001). After taking all of these factors into consideration, private institutions still may be more likely to adopt innovations than public colleges and universities. Private universities are generally more nimble than public institutions. Because of their smaller size and the limited number of constituencies they have fewer people to consult with before adopting an innovation, whereas public universities have to consult with broader political constituencies associated with being a public institution (Duderstadt & Womack, 2003). Private universities are more market-oriented and, as a result, may be more likely to adopt innovations, particularly those related to recruiting students (Getz, et al., 1997). Without the ability to rely on significant government appropriations from the state, private institutions have had to be more responsive to students and had to rely more on alumni and other private donations as wells as gaining funding from the corporate sector. Private institutions also have a greater ability to devise an exclusive or dominant market strategy that differentiates them from other institutions because they have a better understanding of how to develop market strategies to exploit niches and new markets (Rowley & Sherman, 2001). However, Getz, et al., (1997) found in their extensive study of the adoption of innovations in higher education that public institutions were actually more likely to be early adopters of innovations than private universities. While taking into consideration how state and federal regulation can affect the adoption of innovations as well as possible regulatory differences between the adoption of innovations by public and private institutions, the most important point to focus on is the fact that regulatory support affects innovation diffusion (Umanath & Campbell, 1994). Regulations limit choices and define the parameters of opportunities for a college or university (Rowley & Sherman, 2001). Restrictive government regulation will lead to low IT adoption, but where government control is supportive, regulatory support will positively influence the adoption of IT (Zhu & Kraemer, 2005). Volkwein and Sweizter (2006) developed a combined regulatory measure that accounted for the fact that private and public institutions vary in the amount of regulatory control, planning, and resources allocated to them depending on the state where the institution is located. External control related to academic and financial regulation for public institutions varies in each state (Volkwein & Malik, 1997). Overall, public institutions are under greater external control than private institutions . Zumeta (1996) also found that state policy postures differ in each state in regards to private universities. Religiously affiliated private institutions experience greater control and governance than non-church affiliated private universities (Volkwein & Sweizter, 2006). In short, the regulatory support for private and public institutions will vary based on state location which will in turn affect the adoption of and use of IT in the college or university. This leads to the hypothesis that institutions facing higher regulatory support will achieve greater IT use. Environmental Context Summary. The environmental context is the \"arena in which a firm conducts its business--its industry, competitors, access to resources supplied by others, and dealings with government\" (Tornatzky & Fleischer, 1990, p. 154). The competitive pressures and government support and regulation will vary from institution to institution and from state to state. Federal and state government regulation and the type of institution, public or private, will impact the use of IT in the institution. As a result, the external environment will vary in its influence on the use of IT in higher education institutions based on whether the institution is public or private and the location of the institution within the United States. Greater regulatory support combined with competitive pressure will lead to greater usage of IT in higher education. In combination, these two indicators comprising the environmental context will lead to greater institutional effectiveness in terms of the research productivity and the learning productivity of the institution (see primary hypothesis 3)."}, {"section_title": "IT Use", "text": "IT use is influenced by the technological context, organizational context, and environmental context of the institution (Tornatsky & Fleischer, 1990). Unlike the Zhu and Kraemer (2005) study used as a foundational model for this study, specific indicators measuring the extent IT use were not available. While not included as a latent variable in this study, it is important to explain that TOE theory was used as the guide to look at IT use by evaluating the strength and positive or negative relationship of each TOE indicator for the TOE measurement model. As part of the analysis of the TOE measurement model, the correlations between the technological, organizational, and environmental context latent exogenous variables were also examined. Additionally, the TOE factors and indicators were inspected in the structural model to determine the impact of the TOE factors and indicators and IT use (with TOE theory serving as the guide to infer IT usage) on the institutional effectiveness latent variable. Information technology brings with it tremendous challenges and also opportunities. Students and faculty expect to have IT resources available to them. They want access to available information from as many locations as possible using different hardware and software platforms (Foster, 2000). This is further explained by the network effect or network externalities which are based on the increasing attractiveness and value to users of certain kinds of networks as they increase in size and more users use the network. The first telephone or fax machine had little value since there was nobody to call. As more people acquired telephones, telephones became more useful, and more people were perceived value in having one. The value of a network then increases faster than the volume through it (Hayes, et al., 2005;Torrisi, 1998). Colleges or universities that choose not to provide or not to utilize IT resources to enhance the operations of the institution will miss out on potential benefits. Information technology is used in a number of ways in higher education. IT is used for administrative purposes, to conduct research, and for teaching and learning. Administrative uses for information technology include running operations for financial aid, communication, admissions, registration, and student records (O' Donovan, 2000). Information technology combined with the Internet and digital media has clearly enriched the research environment for scientists and scholars. Library and information services play an important role in developing new knowledge and/or understanding (Elkin, 2000). In fact, the networking of computers both individual and institutional has revolutionized the library by allowing users access to extensive online resources which combined with sophisticated search capabilities has greatly enhanced a user's research and learning opportunities (Foster, 2000). Institutions utilize IT resources to enhance the operations of the institution. The back-end of the IT infrastructure that users do not see is the core of the IT infrastructure and at the heart of the capabilities the institution ultimately provides to the users. Part of what the user does not see is the actual Internet connection used to access or transfer data. The Internet connection commonly used by the public, government, and private corporations has come to be known as the commodity Internet connection because it is available to everyone, but most commonly just called the \"Internet\". Internet2 has been developed as a private network to better meet the needs of colleges and universities (Law, 2000) and to work in partnership with industry and government to develop and rapidly deploy advanced Internet technology. Internet2 allows researchers to have a high speed network available exclusively for research purposes instead of relying on the commodity Internet. At institutions with Internet2 connections, not only do faculty and graduate students perform necessary research utilizing Internet2 but undergraduates also have elements of their education \"serve as test beds for many Internet2 products and processes\" (Slaughter & Rhoades, 2004, p. 208). Internet2 connections are provided by the Abilene connection, National LamdaRail Connection, or some other federal government research network connection. Colleges and universities must pay a fee to connect to and utilize this exclusive research network pipeline. Colleges and universities connected to Internet2 will have much greater capabilities to conduct sophisticated research utilizing this high speed connection as well as greater opportunities to collaborate on research with other researchers sharing an Internet2 connection (Elish, 2005). Partially as a result of the high costs of IT, many colleges and universities have joined consortia to share the costs of updating and maintaining the institution's IT infrastructure. Consortia allow colleges and universities to combine to have greater bargaining and purchasing power when negotiating IT purchases with vendors. Colleges or universities use consortia to spread out not only the costs but also to share the risks associated with adopting new technologies as well as to acquire new technological capabilities whose in-house development would require a longer time and higher costs (Torrisi, 1998). In addition, consortia allow colleges and universities to collaborate with other consortia members to better understand how to implement and utilize the technologies they share in order to make informed decisions in relation to IT investments (Duderstadt & Womack, 2003). Colleges and universities with consortia connections will experience greater IT use and institutional effectiveness than those without. In summary, IT has greatly enhanced research and learning opportunities. As institutional IT capacity and IT capabilities increase in size and more users use the network, the increasing attractiveness and value to users of the network increases faster than the volume through it (Hayes, et al., 2005;Torrisi, 1998). As a result of escalating costs for IT, consortia arrangements are entered into and often used to make IT purchases and to share information and conduct research with other institutions. Internet II connections allow users at an institution to exchange and share significant amounts of data and information with external parties. The greater the extent of IT use, the greater the likelihood that the organization will create IT capabilities that are first rate, inimitable, valuable, and sustainable, thereby contributing to value creation and provide a competitive advantage (Zhu & Kraemer, 2005). Colleges and universities that more extensively utilize the IT resources available to them should experience greater institutional effectiveness in comparison to other institutions."}, {"section_title": "Institutional Effectiveness", "text": "Colleges and universities may realize institutional effectiveness from the use of the IT resources of the institution. The institutional effectiveness of a college or university can be measured in terms of the research productivity (research expenditures) and the learning productivity (undergraduate graduation rates) of the institution. Research productivity and graduation rates are outcomes of great interest to internal and external stakeholders of the institution (Dugan, 2006b;Suskie, 2006;. Based on the indicators and related foundational secondary hypotheses comprising the technological, organizational, and environmental context latent variables described previously come three primary hypotheses: \u2022 Primary Hypothesis 1: Institutions with a greater technological context (IT capacity and IT capabilities) are more likely to generate greater institutional effectiveness in terms of the research productivity and learning productivity of the institution. \u2022 Primary Hypothesis 2: Institutions with a greater organizational context (size and potential financial commitment to IT) are more likely to generate greater institutional effectiveness in terms of the research productivity and learning productivity of the institution. \u2022 Primary Hypothesis 3: Institutions with a greater environmental context (competitive pressure and regulatory support) are more likely to generate greater institutional effectiveness in terms of the research productivity and learning productivity of the institution. IT has been linked to increases in research productivity (Clotfelter, 1996) and is often measured in terms of the research expenditures of the institution (Ehrenberg & Hurst, 1998;Middaugh, 2001;Porter & Umbach, 2001;Volkwein & Malik, 1997;. IT has also been linked to learning productivity (Bates, 2000) and is often measured with graduation rates serving as a proxy (Dugan & Hernon, 2006). Recently, the National Commission on the Future of Higher Education 2006called upon colleges and universities to take advantage of technological advances to develop new or better methods of teaching and content delivery to increase student learning. Furthermore, the National Science Foundation (Bement, 2007) called for research colleges and universities to make greater efforts to better utilize IT resources in order for the United States to maintain its status as the leader in advancing and developing new research and knowledge. While the \"prevailing view about faculty's research activity is that it dominates their time to the detriment of instruction\", research has shown that there can be a \"symbiotic relationship\" between teaching and research through incorporation of undergraduate students into their research activity as research assistants. Incorporating undergraduate students into their research activity allows faculty to jointly produce contact with students, an instructional activity, while also conducting research (Rhoades, 2001). The IT resources of the institution provide a tool to help institutions realize these joint production capabilities of research and learning. For example, the IT resources of the institution provide the virtual connections and capabilities to collaborate on sophisticated research experiments with other faculty, students and/or researchers not just at their institution but at locations around the world (Friedman, 2005). Impact on Research Productivity. Primary hypothesis 4 proposes that institutional effectiveness will be positively associated with research productivity (research expenditures) with research productivity represented by the per capita full time faculty research expenditures of the institution. Research produced by colleges and universities has and will continue to have a great impact on society and in laying the technological foundations to build on in the future. Researchers are heavily dependent upon IT to conduct sophisticated research (Gunzburger & Wilgenbusch, 2007). Information technology combined with the Internet and digital media has clearly enriched the research environment for scientists and scholars. Researchers use computers to \"simulate physical phenomena, networks link investigators in virtual laboratories\u2026and digital libraries provide scholars with access to knowledge resources\" (Duderstadt & Womack, 2003, p. 59). IT provides a way to make research more comprehensive and richer, allow for the presentation of results in more motivating and informative ways, and lead to more effective information seeking (Squires, 2000). Faculty need to have access to the appropriate computer resources (Hunt, et al., 1997;Gunzburger & Wilgenbusch, 2007). Research institutions wishing to work at the leading edge of scholarship must have the network capacity in place to do so (Law, 2000). Robust, high speed networks are absolutely essential for colleges and universities because they are knowledge driven institutions. Faculty with high performance computing and with greater computing capacity available to them will have greater capabilities to perform sophisticated research experiments (Bement, 2007;Duderstadt, et al., 2002;Duderstadt & Womack, 2003;Gunzburger & Wilgenbusch, 2007). These research activities benefit the population and society at large. Research has made technology part of everyday life especially in the area of personal computing and information transmission (Middaugh, 2001) with much of the initial developments of many technologies taking place at colleges and universities. For instance, the initial research related to the development of the Internet and the first web browser took place as a part of research conducted at colleges and universities. Future scientific advances in areas such as weather predictions and climate modeling will also require highperformance computers (Gunzburger & Wilgenbusch, 2007). IT provides improvements to information access to help researchers remain better informed. For example, Really Simple Syntax feeds, better known as RSS, broadcast information on a certain topic live to subscribers of the feed and share content specifically related to an area of research. IT provides new publication mechanisms such as online peer review journals that lead to improvements in the extent and quality of academic publications with greater peer involvement. Multimedia provides opportunities to include video and simulations in research publications or materials. IT also provides greater communication opportunities for researchers to interact with other researchers around the world which allows colleagues to collaborate on a global basis instead of on a more localized basis (Squires, 2000). The electronic library will become more and more a crucial component of an institution's information services (Foster, 2000). This will require the IT infrastructure and technologies to provide the necessary information services and resources to faculty to conduct research. IT leads to greater efficiencies and cost-effectiveness in research by allowing researchers to utilize sophisticated online search tools and online access to external research materials instead of relying solely on an institution's physical library resources as was necessary in the past (Squires, 2000). This access requires linking resources, services and the IT infrastructure required to deliver the institutional wide information system (Foster, 2000). The downside to the rapid IT developments has been information overload caused by the abundance of information resources now available. Therefore, automated information seeking and design and sophisticated search engine capabilities have become an important piece of the institutional IT infrastructure of the institution to help differentiate between good and poor quality information (Squires, 2000). In summary, faculty who have high performance computing and greater computing capacity available to them will have greater capabilities to perform sophisticated research experiments. Faculty must have information resources available online to conduct their research. Faculty with greater networking capacity will have greater abilities to share and exchange information with others. External Internet connections and bandwidth from consortia will provide greater capabilities to share and exchange research as well. IT use is an important antecedent to institutional effectiveness in terms of research productivity, which for this study is measured in terms of the per capita full time faculty research expenditures of the institution. Impact on Learning Productivity. Bates (2000) described the process of increasing student learning at an institution as increasing the learning productivity of the institution. IT has been linked to learning productivity (Bates, 2000). Policy makers commonly use the graduation rate of an institution as a proxy for student learning and the graduation rate of a college or university is also used as an indicator of student success (Dugan & Hernon, 2006;Middaugh, 2001). For this study, learning productivity is represented by the undergraduate graduation rate of the institution. Therefore, primary hypothesis 5 is: Institutional effectiveness will be positively associated with learning productivity (undergraduate graduation rates). Instructional technologies, many of which rely on necessary network and computing capabilities, have frequently been used to increase student learning and ability to perform in the classroom (Young, 2005). Faculty utilize instructional technologies to teach certain concepts and principles to students outside of the classroom, which frees up time to utilize more interactive teaching methods during class time (Staley, 2000). Learning object repositories offer one example of an extensive and sophisticated instructional technology used to increase learning and assist students in successfully completing bottleneck courses such as algebra or English. Learning object repositories provide online database resources with personalized learning chunks that can be used and re-used during technology supported learning to aid students in understanding complex pieces of information (Wiley, 2002). These technologies allow learners to access high quality instructional materials at any time and place. Simonson, Smaldino, Albright, and Zvacek (2003) reviewed several empirically based examples where the outcomes of distance education courses using instructional technologies were just as effective if not more so than the learning outcomes of traditional classroom methods. Well-designed online learning materials allow students to learn more easily and quickly in a more personalized manner by moving at their own pace through the instructional materials (Bates, 2000). Instructional technologies provide a learning environment just as effective as traditional classroom instruction (Simonson, et al., 2003;Young, 2005) and in many cases not only increase access, but also increase retention and course completion (Farmer, 2004). Instructional technologies allow for team teaching with guest faculty and/or students from other institutions (Bates, 2000). Instructional technologies are also used to aid in the development of higher order learning skills (Milrad, et al., 2003). Interaction structured through online communications provides more flexibility and greater access to other students and the teachers. Distance learning courses typically utilize online instructional technologies and allow students to accelerate completion of a degree. For example, many students often return home during summer semesters and distance learning courses allow the students to accelerate their degree completion while also allowing them to return home. Additionally, distance learning courses (particularly asynchronous courses which do not require students to synchronously interact with other students) appeal greatly to students working full-time, who travel a lot, who are disabled or place/home bound, and/or serve in the military and may not stay in one place long enough complete a degree program. Distance learning courses allow students flexibility to still take courses while meeting work and other obligations. In summary, learning object repositories, distance learning technologies, and other instructional technologies are used to increase student learning productivity. The use of IT is an important antecedent to institutional effectiveness. In this study, institutional effectiveness is measured in terms of the learning productivity of the institution with graduation rates for undergraduate students serving as a proxy for the measure. Institutions using IT to enhance instruction and to reach out to more students will receive greater institutional effectiveness by graduating more students. Structural Model). The 10 countries were split into two sub samples, one from developed and the other from developing countries, to allow them to compare differences in terms of e-business usage and value based on whether the retail business was located in a developed or developing country. The results from both sub samples supported TOE theory when examining ebusiness usage and value in the retail industry. Zhu and Kraemer (2005) found that regardless of the sub sample that technology competence, firm size, international scope, financial commitment, competitive pressure, and regulatory support were important antecedents of e-business use. The technological competence existing within the technology context was the strongest factor on the use of e-business. The results supported the use of TOE theory to explain the use of e-business by retail businesses. The model showed that actual e-business use was significant to realizing e-business value which suggested that use would be a missing link if not included in the model. Zhu and Kraemer (2005) also discovered differences between how the model they tested differed depending on whether the retail business was located in a developing or in a developed country. Competitive pressure and regulatory support differed for the two sub samples which confirmed that economic and governmental influences affect ebusiness usage. Competitive pressure had a greater impact on e-business usage in retail businesses in developed countries. This finding supported the literature that states that developed countries have more mature markets characterized by more transparent information flow and stable legal frameworks and government policies which may force businesses in developed countries to adopt and use e-business to avoid competitive decline. On the other hand, regulatory support had a greater impact on e-business usage in retail businesses located in developing countries where there is information asymmetry and immature institutional structure. As a result, the government regulation and legal protection or lack thereof tends to be a greater force in developing countries.  In sum, Zhu and Kraemer's (2005) study developed an integrative theoretical framework based on TOE theory for assessing e-business use and value beyond just an initial dichotomous (yes/no) decision. They challenged researchers to test their model in other information systems and/or in different settings in order to better understand the complex relationships between technological, organizational, and environmental contexts and organizational performance. The model tested in this study is a response to this invitation to test TOE theory and Zhu and Kraemer's model related to the use of IT."}, {"section_title": "Model for the Study: IT Use and Institutional Effectiveness", "text": "Rather than studying e-business use and value, Zhu and Kraemer's model (2005) was adapted to study IT use and institutional effectiveness in higher education (see Technological context indicators, institutional size, financial commitment to IT, competitive pressure, and regulatory support were evaluated to test TOE theory (the technological, organizational, and environmental context of the institution) in higher education institutions which states that each of these factors is a significant antecedent to IT use in the institution.

This study tested a structural equation model to explore how the factors (technological, organizational, and environmental context) that influence the use of information technology affect the research productivity and learning productivity of higher education institutions. The structural equation model was based on the theoretical literature and compared research oriented (research and doctoral) institutions to teaching oriented (masters and baccalaureate) institutions (see Fig 3.1: Proposed Institutional Effectiveness Structural Model). Ultimately, this study suggested or illuminated possible influences or causes of differences between these groups related to how the factors that influence the use of IT affected institutional effectiveness in terms of research productivity (research expenditures) and learning productivity (undergraduate graduation rates) in higher education. Structural equation modeling is used to \"attempt to determine the cause or consequences of differences that already exist between or among groups\" (Fraenkel & Wallen, 2003, p. 369). While recognizing that this study is exploratory and will be based on one wave of data, a causal comparative research design to test a structural model is appropriate because it provides the ability to test hypothesized relationships between observed and latent variables. In addition, structural equation modeling does not require \"default model specification\" and places relatively \"few limits on what types of relations can be specified\" (Coughlin, 2003, p. 206). However, structural models should be interpreted cautiously because \"criteria for comparing models and assessing goodness-of-fit indices are relative and not absolute\" and the \"fact that a particular sample fits a model does not confirm that the model is a good representation of reality\" (Stewart & Segars, 2002, p. 45). Structural models should only be \"viewed as scientific evidence to the extent that they can be replicated in subsequent studies\" (Stewart & Segars, 2002, p. 45). The National Science Foundation Survey of Science and Engineering Research Facilities (SSERF) and three other data sources (described later in the chapter) were used to make these comparisons. "}, {"section_title": "Research Question Foundational Secondary Hypotheses", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Secondary Hypothesis 3: Potential financial commitment to IT will be a positive", "text": "indicator of the organizational context and IT use. A necessary condition for an innovation's success is the commitment of resources, especially financial resources (Lu, 2000). Insufficient resources and funding becomes a significant obstacle to realizing institutional effectiveness in research and teaching (Foster, 2000). Adequate financial resources must be available before many opportunities can be undertaken (Hunt, et al., 1997). The funds to pay for the maintenance of the current IT infrastructure and any expansions or additions to the IT infrastructure of the institution come from the total annual expenditures of the institution. Institutions must dedicate a significant amount of money from the total annual expenditures to maintain, update, or expand IT which is critical to survival in the knowledge economy (Duderstadt, et al., 2002).  (Zhu & Kraemer, 2005). Competition to enhance reputation and prestige among higher education institutions is fierce (Newman & Couturier, 2001). Competitive pressures to increase prestige will serve as a driver for innovation with institutions working to identify ways to outperform competitors by increasing their research productivity (Kirp, 2003) especially since resources are skewed toward the fulfillment of research agendas rather than undergraduate education (Rowley & Sherman, 2001). The study hypothesizes that institutions with greater prestige will receive greater competitive pressure that will positively impact IT use. Secondary Hypothesis 5: Regulatory support will be a positive indicator of the environmental context and IT use. Colleges and universities are influenced by a number of parties which impose regulations and control that can affect the adoption and use of IT and other innovations. Government regulation if restrictive will lead to low IT adoption, but where government control is supportive it can positively influence innovation diffusion and the adoption of IT (Zhu & Kraemer, 2005). Public institutions are under greater external control than private institutions . Zumeta (1996) found that state policy postures differ in each state for private universities. External control related to academic and financial regulation for public institutions varies in each state as well (Volkwein & Malik, 1997). Religiously affiliated private institutions receive greater control and governance than non-church affiliated private universities (Volkwein & Sweizter, 2006). As a result of regulatory differences between public and private institutions and the positions taken on policy in the home state, differences in regulatory support will be observed to affect the adoption of IT innovations in the institution. Institutions facing higher regulatory support will achieve a greater extent of IT use."}, {"section_title": "Research Question Primary Hypotheses", "text": "Colleges and universities may realize institutional effectiveness from the use of the IT resources of the institution.

Therefore, information from all three articles was used to create the combined measure of state policy towards control and regulation with low control and regulation representing high regulatory support."}, {"section_title": "Data Source 4:", "text": "In order to replicate the regulatory support measure Volkwein and Sweitzer (2006) developed, one research article published in the Journal of Higher Education and two research articles published in the Research in Higher Education journal served as sources for this regulatory measure.

The source used to obtain the Zumeta's work necessary for the final Volkwein and Sweitzer (2006) state policy regulatory measure used in this study was an article entitled \"Meeting the demand for higher education without breaking the bank: A framework for the design of state higher education policies for an era of increasing demand\" published in the Journal of Higher Education. Additionally, the measure of state policy towards public higher education developed by Volkwein and Malik (1997) was used in this study to measure the degree of public control for the regulatory support variable. The article by Volkwein and Malik (1997) was entitled \"State regulation and administrative flexibility at public universities\" and published in Research in Higher Education.

Unfortunately, there were not a sufficient number (i.e. minimum 150) of institutions in the SSERF to use these four distinct groups as comparison groups in a structural equation model (Schumaker & Lomax, 1996). However, Getz, et al., (1997)  For the study, the very high research, high research, and doctoral institutions were combined into one research oriented group. The master's high, master's medium, and master's low, arts & sciences baccalaureate, and diverse fields baccalaureate institutions were combined into one teaching oriented group. These combinations into one research oriented group and one teaching oriented group were necessary to ensure that there was a large enough sample of at least 150 institutions to make a group comparison (see Table   3.1: Number of Research and Teaching Institutions Included in the Study). Additionally, in order to be included in this study the institutions must also have data available in the five data sources used for the study (see Table 3.2: Sources for Research Question Constructs/Variables). All of the data sources are from 2005 unless otherwise indicated. Variables Used in the Study The study examined a number of variables. The exogenous (independent) latent variables were: 1) technology competence (which exists within the technology context of the institution), 2) organizational context which consists of size and financial commitment, and 3) environmental context which consists of competitive pressure and regulatory support. The endogenous (dependent) latent variables were 1) IT use which was measured in terms of the combination of the three exogenous variables of technology competence, organizational context, and environmental context and 2) institutional effectiveness which was measured in terms of the research productivity (per capita full time faculty research expenditures) and the learning productivity (undergraduate graduation rate) of the institution. Descriptive statistics for the means and standard deviations for the final set of variables analyzed in the study were provided in the analysis. The data was examined to look for normality because normality influences the statistical techniques used to analyze the data. Different statistical procedures are required to examine a structural model if the data is not normally distributed (Schumacker & Lomax, 1996). The following section provides a description of how the indicators comprising each latent variable were measured. Adjustments to the latent variable were made when appropriate if an indicator was insignificant to the overall latent variable."}, {"section_title": "Technological Context Latent Variable", "text": "The technological context describes \"both the existing technologies in use and new technologies relevant to the firm\" (Zhu & Kraemer, 2005, p. 63).

All three organizational context indicators were tested as part of the measurement model. Size. Zhu and Kraemer (2005) used the number of employees at the retail businesses as an indicator of size for their study. The total undergraduate student FTE enrollment was used to represent institutional size for the organizational context latent variable and was obtained from IPEDS. Getz, et al. (1997) used this same measure of institutional size in their analysis of the adoption of technology and other innovations. Rather than draw arbitrary size parameters, the analysis treated institutional size as a continuous variable and looked for differences in IT use based on what happens statistically as size increased or decreased in the model. "}, {"section_title": "Environmental Context Latent Variable", "text": "The environmental context is the \"arena in which a firm conducts its business-its industry, competitors, access to resources supplied by others, and dealings with government\" (Tornatzky & Fleischer, 1990, p. 154). The environmental context indicators were competitive pressure and regulatory support. Both environmental context indicators were tested as part of the measurement model. Competitive Pressure. Zhu and Kraemer (2005) assessed the local and national competitive pressure of the retail businesses in their study. For this study, the competitive pressure indicator for the environmental context latent variable was operationalized by the prestige peer score of the institution. Rather than corporate profits, currency in higher education is measured by institutional prestige and reputation (Rowley & Sherman, 2001) and this quest for excellence is a major aspect of competition among colleges and universities. Higher education institutions strive for excellence and to increase the prestige and reputation of the school compared to peer institutions. The competing institutions were grouped by mission orientation with research oriented institutions competing with other research oriented institutions while teaching oriented institutions compete against other teaching oriented institutions. Colleges and universities use college ranking systems as an indicator of institutional prestige and aggressively use rankings for marketing purposes (Hossler, 2004). The prestige served as the measure of competitive pressure, i.e. the greater the prestige the greater the competition (Ehrenberg, 2002). The sample was split into two separate groups to examine the impact of competitive pressure as measured by the prestige of the institution. The US News and World Report (USNWR) was used to identify which of the institutions were considered to have higher prestige than others as evidenced by the inclusion of the institution in the USNWR annual rankings. Institutions that were included in the USNWR prestige rankings were included in the \"high prestige\" group while those that were not ranked were included in the \"low prestige\" group. A total of 173 institutions were included in the \"high prestige\" group whereas the remaining 212 institutions were included in the \"low prestige\" group. Regulatory Support. The Zhu and Kraemer (2005) study assessed the level of government control and the legal environment of the retail businesses for their analysis. For this study, the regulatory support indicator for the environmental context latent variable was calculated using Volkwein and Sweitzer's (2006)  This measure also drew upon the trichotomized measures of academic and financial regulation developed by Volkwein and Malik (1997). Each of these two measures were on a scale from one to three, with one indicating low state regulation and three indicating high regulation. The financial measure and the academic measure were combined with the base score to create a single scale of regulatory control for public institutions ranging from three to seven. \"Laissez-Faire\" were assigned a one (least centralized) and those located in states categorized as \"Central Planning\" were assigned a five (most centralized). Then one additional point was added to the scale score for each college or university that was controlled by or affiliated with a religious denomination. This combined measure of control ranged from one to six for private institutions. Each institution in the analysis received a combined governance/control score. The total possible level of governance/control ranged from a low of one (for non-church affiliated privates in the least-regulatory states) to a high of seven (for public institutions in states with the highest levels of financial and academic regulation). It was hypothesized that institutions with a lower combined governance/control would experience greater regulatory support. IT Use Zhu and Kraemer (2005) used specific indicators that measured the extent of the IT use of each organization included in their study. However, specific questions related to the actual extent of IT usage by each institution were not included in the 2005 SSERF. As a result, this study relied on TOE theory (Tornatsky & Fleischer, 1990) which states that the technological, organizational, and environmental context impacts the extent of the IT use at the institution. Zhu and Kraemer's (2005) study clearly confirmed that TOE theory impacts the extent of IT usage related to retail businesses."}, {"section_title": "Institutional Effectiveness Latent Variable", "text": "Zhu and Kraemer (2005) used the latent variable IT value to describe the impact of IT use on three outcomes of interest to retail businesses: sales, procurement, and internal operations. IT value is a term common to private industry to describe the business value or effectiveness of IT in a corporation. In higher education, institutional effectiveness is the term used to describe the effectiveness of colleges and universities. For this study, the institutional effectiveness latent variable was based on the research productivity and learning productivity indicators. Both institutional effectiveness indicators were tested as part of the measurement model. productivity (Middaugh, 2001). Several studies have used research expenditures as a measure of research productivity (Ehrenberg & Hurst, 1998;Porter & Umbach, 2001;Volkwein & Malik, 1997;. Volkwein and Sweitzer (2006) recommended using a per capita faculty research productivity measure to control for the size of the institution and to provide a more accurate picture of the research productivity of the institution. The full time faculty and the indicator was obtained from the Integrated to allow for the inclusion of both public and private institutions in one study involving the governance and control of academic institutions (see Table 3.3: Data Sources for Research Question Variables for complete summary of latent variable data sources).

Institutions were placed into two groups based on the mission of the institution: 1) research oriented institutions and 2) teaching oriented institutions. Two separate structural models, one model for research oriented institutions and a second model for teaching oriented institutions, were evaluated. The two models were compared to determine group differences between research oriented and teaching oriented institutions."}, {"section_title": "Development of Measurement Model", "text": "The development of the measurement model included testing the indicators for each latent variable used in the structural model.

Based on the assessment of the CFA, the measurement model was further refined and then fitted again."}, {"section_title": "Testing the Full Structural Model", "text": "Testing the full structural model involved successive stages of statistical testing and refinement (Straub, 1989). The SEM for the full study model included an evaluation of the fit of the model to the data. Factor loadings and squared multiple correlations between each latent and observed variable were examined. To interpret the fit of the model, goodness of fit tests were used. A fitted variance-covariance matrix was provided to show the statistical fit results for each element tested in the model. If the model was not acceptable, then revisions were made to the model based on theoretical credibility. When an acceptable fit for a theoretically credible model was obtained, the associated estimated direct, indirect, and total causal effects were described. In order to accomplish this, Schumaker and Lomax (1996) recommended following five steps for the SEM analysis: 1) model specification, 2) identification, 3) estimation, 4) testing fit, and 5) respecification of the full study model. Testing Fit. To test the fit of the model involved interpreting model fit or comparing fit indices for alternative or nested models. Schumacker and Lomax (1996) stated that no goodness of fit index \"serves as a definite criterion for testing a hypothesized structural model and an ideal fit index does not exist\" (p. 135). In addition, some fit indices are subjective. Therefore, the results of all goodness of fit measures used in the analysis were reported as well as justification to support the researcher's decision related to determining whether or not the data fit the model being examined. When testing structural models, it is important to use multiple model fit tests because each test focuses on testing different aspects of the model (Kline, 2005;Schumaker & Lomax, 1996). For this study, the Chi Square (nonsignificant with degrees of freedom) was used to test overall model fit. To make model baseline comparisons, three fit indices were used: Normed Fit Index (NFI between .9-1), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI between .9-1), and Comparative Fit Index (CFI between .9-1). Additionally, the Respecification. If the model fit indices suggested a poor model fit, this step was used to delete, add, or modify paths in the model. Then another subsequent analysis was done to compare the fit of the proposed or previous versions of the structural model with the respecified structural model. Model fit indices and/or tests of paths from the initial model were used to guide this effort until the final theoretically supported model was arrived at. However, as mentioned previously, structural models should only be \"viewed as scientific evidence to the extent that they can be replicated in subsequent studies\" (Stewart & Segars, 2002, p. 45).

The means and standard deviations of the research oriented and teaching oriented institutions provide an interesting comparison of each indicator of the latent variables used in this study. In looking at the three IT capability indicators used for the technological context latent variable (see Table   4.1: IT Capability Means and Standard Deviations: Research vs. Teaching) it was clear that most research oriented institutions obtained bandwidth from a consortium (74%) and owned dark fiber (fiber-optic cable that has been laid but is not being used) connected between campus buildings (94%) but did not own dark fiber connected to the institution's Internet service provider (36%). As would be expected, the teaching oriented institutions were less likely to have these three IT capabilities on campus as 52% obtained bandwidth from a consortium, 81% owned dark fiber connected between campus buildings, and 19% owned dark fiber connected to an Internet service provider. Note: Dichotomous indicators where 0 = \"No\" and 1 = \"Yes\". Overall, it was clear that both groups of institutions recognized the importance of planning for future needs to quickly expand fiber-optic networking capacity with 94% of research oriented institutions and 81% of teaching oriented institutions having laid dark fiber to connect campus buildings. Though the survey data did not specify this, most likely these institutions with dark fiber in place have included dark fiber as an important piece of their IT strategic plan and include a significant amount of dark fiber whenever new construction takes place because adding dark fiber to existing buildings is much more expensive and difficult. This finding emphasized the value that both research and teaching oriented institutions place on having dark fiber connections between campus buildings. In terms of the other two IT capability indicators, it was clear that IT consortia definitely are being utilized by both research oriented (74%) and teaching oriented (52%) institutions to obtain bandwidth to have greater purchasing power as well as to share costs. Additionally, consortia provide opportunities for institutions to exchange best practices and ideas with other consortium members. Lastly, it was evident that having dark fiber connections to an Internet service provider was not very likely at research oriented (36%) or teaching oriented (19%) institutions. IT Capacity Indicator Descriptive Statistics. Since four of the IT capacity indicators for the technological context latent variable were ordinal and not measured continuously, the means, standard deviations, and percentages for each indicator were compared separately. The means for research oriented institutions were higher in all cases than the teaching oriented institutions (see Table 4.  Note: * Indicates that for these ordinal variables, 1 = \"lowest/slowest\" possible rate. IT Capacity Indicator Descriptive Statistics. In order to dig deeper to better understand how the IT capacity indicators differed for research and teaching institutions, the percentages of these indicators were also examined after converting the indicators to continuous terms (see Table 4.3: IT Capacity Percentile Based Comparisons: Research vs. Teaching). These percentage based comparisons showed that while over half of research oriented institutions had Internet2 (60%) and Internet1 (61%) connections and maximum speeds through any Internet connection (49%) greater than 100 megabits per second, teaching oriented institutions had significantly fewer Internet2 (17%) and Internet1 (23%) connections and maximum speeds through any Internet connection (11%) at this speed or greater. The maximum network speeds were also very different for research oriented institutions compared to teaching oriented institutions with 69% of research oriented institutions having maximum speeds on their network of 1 to 2.5 gigabits per second compared to only 43% for teaching oriented institutions. As indicated previously, there was a great disparity in terms of having at least one high performance computer on campus between research oriented institutions (86%) and teaching oriented institutions (46%). "}, {"section_title": "Organizational Context Descriptive Statistics", "text": "The organizational context indicators for research oriented institutions of size (FTE students) and potential financial commitment to IT (total expenditures) differed greatly in comparison to teaching oriented institutions (see Table 4.4: Organizational Context Comparisons: Research vs. Teaching). Research oriented institutions (16,915 FTE students) were more than twice as large as teaching oriented institutions (6,832 FTE students). In terms of the potential financial commitment to IT based on the total expenditures available, research oriented institutions ($422,217,000) had more than three times the amount of total expenditures available to allocate to the operations of the institution, including IT, than teaching oriented institutions ($113,461,000). These differences emphasize the disparity between size and resources available to research oriented institutions compared to teaching oriented institutions. "}, {"section_title": "Environmental Context Descriptive Statistics", "text": "The environmental context indicator (see Table 4.5: Environmental Context Comparisons: Research vs. Teaching) of regulatory support (1 = low support to 7 = high support) was nearly identical for teaching oriented (4.75) and research oriented (4.65) institutions. This showed that teaching and research institutions in this sample faced a very similar amount of state policy regulatory support and governance control. However, not surprisingly, 53% of the research oriented institutions faced greater competitive pressure to innovate, in terms of having high prestige, compared to only 34% of the teaching oriented institutions. "}, {"section_title": "Institutional Effectiveness Descriptive Statistics", "text": "The institutional effectiveness indicators of research productivity (research expenditures) and learning productivity (undergraduate graduation rate) showed a very large difference between research oriented institutions and teaching oriented institutions in terms of research productivity but had somewhat similar learning productivity outcomes (see Table 4.6: Institutional Effectiveness Comparisons: Research vs. Teaching). Research oriented institutions (95.90) had almost seven times higher research productivity rates in terms of the per capita full time faculty research expenditures compared to teaching oriented institutions (13.72). Alternatively, some might expect teaching oriented institutions to have higher learning productivity rates than research oriented institutions because of a greater focus on teaching and learning and emphasis on graduation rates. However, research oriented institutions (61.09%) had higher learning productivity (undergraduate graduation rates) than teaching oriented institutions (50.87%).  (Schumacker & Lomax, 1996). One of the most commonly used methods for identifying univariate outliers is the mean +/-3 standard deviations (Kline, 2005). A limitation of this method for identifying outliers is that outliers affect means and standard deviations. As a result, the outlier detection method used for this study was the median plus or minus two inter-quartile ranges (difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles). Rather than deleting univariate outliers, a compromise solution was used which was to bring outliers to the fence (i.e., the upper or lower criterion). This approach lessens the impact of a univariate outlier on the results, thereby enhancing generalizability yet acknowledging that a very high or very low data point exists. In the case of dichotomous indicator outliers, no adjustments were made. Bivariate outliers were identified by looking at scatter plots with each variable paired together. If necessary, an adjustment was made to correct a data entry error, but no institutions were deleted from the population based on the testing for bivariate outliers. Multivariate outliers were also tested by looking at the Mahalonobis distance and looking for large values (Kline, 2005). After doing so, no cases were dropped. Multivariate and Univariate Normality Tests. Multivariate and univariate normality is very important for testing structural equation models. This means that tests for linearity and homoscedasticity of bivariate scatterplots is important to conduct (Kline, 2005). Each indicator was examined for normality using normal probability plots ( which emphasized the strength of the skew of this indicator. Because this indicator was dichotomous, no adjustments or transformations were employed. Since this indicator clearly did not have a normal distribution and could severely impact further analysis in the structural model plus the indicator was dichotomous, the decision was made to drop this indicator from further analysis for research oriented institutions (Kline, 2005). For the teaching oriented group, no indicator exhibited strong skewness (> or < 2.0) or considerable leptokurtic distributions (>3.0). However, both dark fiber indicators displayed a moderate skew. The dark fiber connection to ISP (1.608) was moderately positively skewed because only 19% of teaching oriented institutions had the presence of this indicator while the dark fiber connection to buildings (-1.558) was moderately negatively skewed because 81% of teaching oriented institutions had the presence of this indicator. These two indicators were not dropped at this point from the analysis but were monitored closely during later analyses to see if dropping either or both of these two moderately skewed indicators would enhance the fit of the final structural model presented for teaching oriented institutions. Multicollinearity Tests. If the intercorrelations among two indicators or variables is too high (>.9), \"this can cause certain mathematical operations to become either impossible or unstable because some denominators are close to zero\" (Kline, 2005, p. 57). Multicollinearity can be spotted by examining the correlation matrix for values >.90, the tolerance for values less than .10, and the variance inflation factor (VIF) to see if the one VIF values was 10 times greater than the second VIF value. No indicators exhibited multicollinearity based on these three tests for high correlation and high VIF values or low tolerance values (see Table 4.8: Study Indicator Correlations: Research Institutions and Table 4.9: Study Indicator Correlations: Teaching Institutions). Research Oriented Institution Correlations. When looking at the correlations for the exogenous latent variables (see Table 4.  As size often serves as a proxy for the financial resources of the institution (Rogers, 1995), it was not surprising to find that potential financial commitment to IT was highly correlated with size (.67). Potential financial commitment to IT also had similar Teaching Oriented Institution Correlations. Although none of the indicators for the teaching oriented institutions clearly exhibited multicollinearity (Kline, 2005), two of the correlations for the exogenous latent variables were higher than .80 (see Table 4.9: Correlations of Indicators Used in the Analysis for Teaching Oriented Institutions). The highest correlation was the correlation of .86 between size and potential financial commitment to IT. Rogers (1995) stated that it was common for size and resources to be highly correlated in studies of the adoption of innovations. For the research oriented institutions, the correlation between these two indicators was not nearly as high at .67 and both indicators were kept in the model. However, for teaching oriented institutions because the correlation of size and potential financial commitment to IT was so strong, the decision was made to remove potential financial commitment to IT from the teaching oriented institution model (C. Siebert, personal communication, December 18, 2007). Size served as a proxy for this indicator instead (Rogers, 1995). Similar to the research oriented institutions, it was not unexpected to find that Internet1 and the speed of the Internet connection had a correlation of .81. Dissimilarly, Internet2 only had a moderate correlation of .52 with Internet1 and .54 with Internet speed. This was not startling to find because Internet2 is primarily used for research and research is not emphasized as greatly at teaching oriented institutions. However, with a correlation greater than .80 between the Internet1 and speed of the Internet connection, the speed of the Internet connection was dropped from future analyses for teaching oriented institutions (C. Siebert, personal communication, December 18, 2007). When looking at correlations between the two endogenous indicators of research productivity (per capita research expenditures) and learning productivity (undergraduate graduation rate) as well as the correlations between the exogenous indicators and the two endogenous indicators, it became apparent that it may not be likely to find an admissible model solution with a good model fit for the teaching oriented institution structural model tested in this study. To begin with, the two endogenous indicators of institutional effectiveness of research productivity and learning productivity had a very low and negative correlation (-.07). The highest correlation with research productivity and any of the exogenous indicators was a low correlation of .26 between high performance computing and research productivity. Only the two environmental context indicators had moderate to high correlations with learning productivity. Competitive pressure (prestige) had a high correlation of .73 while regulatory support had a moderately negative correlation (-.39) with learning productivity. As with research oriented institutions, it was not surprising to find a high correlation between competitive pressure and learning productivity . Interestingly, the moderately negative correlation of regulatory support (-.39) and learning productivity was similar to the correlation between those two indicators for the research oriented institutions (-.24). In sum, after reviewing the correlations of the teaching oriented institutions and discovering 1) two correlations of two pairs of exogenous indicators were greater than .80, 2) a low negative correlation (-.07) between the two endogenous indicators of research and learning productivity, 3) low correlations between all of the exogenous indicators and research productivity, and 4) only one high and one moderate correlation between an exogenous indicator and learning productivity, finding an admissible solution that had a good model fit seemed unlikely for the full institutional effectiveness structural model for teaching oriented institutions."}, {"section_title": "Results for EFA", "text": "While TOE theory has a strong theoretical foundation particularly in the private sector, with this study serving an exploratory study for testing TOE theory in higher education the decision was made to explore the latent structure of the exogenous TOE indicators to get an initial understanding of how many factors account for the shared variance among the indicators (Coughlin, 2005). For the research oriented institutions, the principal axis method was used to extract the components followed by a promax (oblique) rotation (see Table 4.10: Exploratory Factor Analysis: Research Institutions). The results showed support for two factors with the first factor comprising the organizational and technological context indicators (Tech/Org. Context) and the second factor comprising the environmental context indicators (Environ. Context). Two technological context indicators loaded below .50 on either factor and also loaded very similarly on both factors. The first of these two technological context indicators, dark fiber connection to an ISP, loaded at .302 on factor 1 and .435 on factor 2. The second indicator, number of high performance computers on campus, loaded at .445 on factor 1 and .376 on factor 2. The rest of the indicators clearly loaded on one factor or the other. Overall, the results showed a strong relationship between the technological context and the organizational context of research oriented institutions. Therefore, the decision was made when testing a model for research oriented institutions to first test the proposed TOE measurement model with three factors and then test the two factor model that was extracted during the exploratory factor analysis. For teaching oriented institutions, principal component analysis utilizing a promax (oblique) rotation indicated the presence of two to four factors. The eigen-one or Kaiser-Guttman rule instructs a researcher to only keep factors greater than 1.0 because a factor must account for variance at least as large as the variance of a single standardized variable. However, this rule is still somewhat arbitrary and theory should be the guide in determining the appropriate number of factors to extract (Coughlin, 2005). Using this rule produced four factors (see Table 4.11: Exploratory Factor Analysis: Teaching Institutions). Factor one (Int. Bndwdth) consisted of the Internet bandwidth related indicators, factor two (Env. Cxt) consisted of the environmental context indicators, factor three (DFB/CMP) consisted of dark fiber to building and high performance computing, and factor four (Network) consisted of dark fiber to ISP and maximum network speed. However, using the scree plot as a guide to look for an elbow to eliminate all factors on the gradual declining slope after the bend in the scree, showed a model consisting of just the first two or three factors may be more appropriate.  and regulatory support (.790 loading). This supported the proposed model for the study that these two environmental context indicators would comprise a factor. The DFJ/Cmp (third) factor comprised of dark fiber connections to buildings on campus (.735 loading) and high performance computers on campus (.705 loading) did not make theoretical sense because high performance computers do not connect to or relate to the campus network. However, the Network (fourth) factor comprised of dark fiber connections to an ISP (.760 loading) and maximum networking speed (.719 loading) did make sense, since both were related to the current or future networking capability and capacity of the institution. The only indicator that did not load strongly on a factor was size, which loaded similarly on the Int. Bndwth (first) factor comprised of Internet bandwidth indicators (Internet 1, Internet 2, and consortium connections) and Env. Cxt (second) factor comprised of the environmental context indicators (competitive pressure and regulatory support). For the Int. Bndwth (first) factor, it would make sense for size to load on this factor because larger institutions are more likely to have greater Internet1 and Internet2 capacity as well as to utilize consortia to make these connections. With the Env. Cxt (second) factor, it would also make sense for size to load on this factor as well because competitive pressure in terms of prestige has a powerful influence on decision making and the utilization of campus resources (Ehrenberg 2000(Ehrenberg , 2003Hossler, 2000;Monks & Ehrenberg, 1999;Slaughter & Rhoades, 2004) with size serving as a proxy for resources of the institution. Additionally, the level of regulatory support faced by the institution also influences the decision of the utilization of campus resources . In summary, with 1) the DFB/Cmp (third) and Network (fourth) factors having eigen-one values just barely greater than 1.0, 2) the DFB/Cmp (third) factor not making theoretical sense, 3) size loading similarly on two factors, and 4) the scree plot showing that two to three factors may be more appropriate, the decision was made to first test the proposed three factor TOE measurement model for teaching oriented institutions and then test different combinations of this two to four factor model that was extracted."}, {"section_title": "Results for TOE Measurement Models", "text": "Before testing the full institutional effectiveness structural model, the foundational technological, organizational, and environmental (TOE) measurement model was tested.

Based on the assessment of the CFA, the measurement model was further refined and then fitted again until a final model was selected. This process was repeated for the full institutional effectiveness structural model. The results of testing the TOE measurement model and full institutional effectiveness structural model for research oriented and teaching oriented institutions are reported in the following sections."}, {"section_title": "Research Oriented Institution TOE Measurement Model", "text": "Identification. To begin with, the proposed TOE measurement model for research oriented institutions (see Fig 4.1: Proposed TOE Model: Research Institutions) was tested. The first step taken was to make sure the proposed model was identified. Scale dependency was handled by fixing the variance of the three latent variables (technological context, organizational context, and environmental context) to \"1\". The proposed TOE measurement model passed the t-rule which requires the number of parameters to be equal to or less than the number of independent pieces of information in the covariance matrix (Kline, 2005). The proposed model passed the t-rule as evidenced by there being 32 degrees of freedom for this model. Since there were more than two latent variables and each latent variable had at least two indicators, the two indicator rule was also passed. Based on this review, the proposed model was identified. tested was based on the results from the exploratory factor analysis (EFA). The EFA called for a two factor model with a combined technological and organizational context latent variable and an environmental context latent variable, which was tested. However, the error term for competitive pressure still had a negative variance. The next model tested drew upon the theory that suggests that the indicators for the environmental context (competitive pressure and regulatory support) and organizational context (size and potential financial commitment) are correlated, particularly competitive pressure . With prestige serving as the indicator of competitive pressure experienced by the institution, research has shown that prestige has a powerful influence on trustees, alumni, faculty, large donors, college presidents, provosts, and deans (Ehrenberg 2000(Ehrenberg , 2003Hossler, 2000;Monks & Ehrenberg, 1999;Slaughter & Rhoades, 2004) who make the operational decisions of the institution. Therefore, the organizational context and environmental context latent variables were combined into one factor (see Fig 4.  Interpretation of Results. The standardized regression results from the final TOE measurement model showed regulatory support had a minimal impact on a research oriented institution (-.041). Regulatory support (.561 p value) was also the only non significant standardized regression weight (see Table 4.12: TOE Standardized Regression Weights: Research Institutions). All other standardized regression weights were significant at the .001 level. Note: *** Indicates standardized regression weight for the indicator was significant at the .001 level. Since the extent of IT use cannot be examined because observed indicators related to the extent of IT use were not included in the SSERF dataset, the correlation was the best statistical test to examine the relationship between the technological context and the organizational and environmental context of research oriented institutions. TOE theory indicates that these three contexts (technological, organizational, and environmental context) positively impact the extent of IT use in an organization (Zhu & Kraemer, 2005). The final model showed that the technological context of research oriented institutions was highly correlated (.80) with the combined organizational and environmental context factor. While correlation does not and should not be viewed as indicating causality, based on TOE theory, it is likely that the technological context and combined organizational and environmental impact the extent of IT use in research oriented institutions. Using TOE theory as a guide, the standardized total effects also shed light as to what indicators may impact the extent of IT use in research oriented institutions (see When looking at the organizational and environmental context of research oriented institutions, the potential financial commitment to IT (total expenditures) of the institution had the greatest total effect on the combined organizational and environmental context latent variable with a very high standardized total effect of .958. This finding emphasizes the importance of the total expenditures of research oriented institutions when considering the TOE of the organization. Size had a relatively high standardized total effect (.689) as well which should not be surprising since size and total expenditures of a research oriented institution are correlated . Furthermore, this supports the earlier work of Getz, et al., (1996) that found that larger size positively affects the adoption and use of technology in research oriented institutions."}, {"section_title": "Teaching Oriented Institution TOE Measurement Model", "text": "Identification. Before addressing model identification, it should be noted that even though size and potential financial commitment to IT were highly correlated at .86, since these two indicators were separate research hypotheses, the researcher wanted to test models with both indicators in the initial TOE measurement model for teaching oriented institutions (see Fig 4.3: Proposed TOE Model: Teaching Institutions). With that as a preface, the first step required making sure that the proposed model was identified. After that, scale dependency was handled by fixing the variance of the three latent variables (technological context, organizational context, and environmental context) to 1. The trule was easily passed with 41 degrees of freedom for this model and the two indicator rule was also passed. Therefore, this model was identified. Since size is often used as a proxy for the financial resources of an organization (Rogers, 1995), the decision was made to remove potential financial commitment to IT (total expenditures) from the model. The exploratory factor analysis supported this decision as well with a two factor solution making more theoretical sense in this case. Therefore, a two factor TOE measurement model with the combined organizational and environmental context was tested next.   Further comparisons also favored the alternative model without the dark fiber to buildings indicator as the NFI increased from .691 to .721 and the CFI increased from .809 to .815. On the other hand, the TLI decreased from .747 to .744 and the RMSEA increased from .076 to .086, which favored the previous model. However, since the AIC dropped from 128.609 to 113.504 for the model without the dark fiber to buildings indicator, overall the model without both the dark fiber to buildings indicator and the financial commitment to IT indicator was considered a better fitting model than the model with just the potential financial commitment to IT indicator removed. Next, alternative models without the dark fiber to ISP indicator and other technological context indicators were tested. None of these alternative models significantly improved model fit. Therefore, the model with the combined organizational and environmental context without both the potential financial commitment to IT and the dark fiber to buildings indicator was selected as the best fitting model with an admissible solution for explaining TOE for teaching oriented institutions."}, {"section_title": "Interpretation of Results.", "text": "The final TOE measurement model for teaching oriented institutions showed that the technological context factor of the organization had a low correlation (.25) with the combined organizational and environmental (OE) context factor for teaching oriented institutions. Using TOE theory as a guide, it appeared that that when examining both the technological context factor and the (OE) context factor of teaching oriented institutions, TOE did not do nearly as much to explain IT use for teaching oriented institutions since the technological context factor and OE context factor were not closely related. On the other hand, the technological context and OE context factor had a high correlation of .80 for research oriented institutions. Relying again on TOE theory, the standardized total effects further illustrated the diminished importance of the technological context of teaching oriented institutions in comparison to the organizational and environmental context of these institutions (see Table 4.14: TOE Standardized Total Effects: Teaching Institutions). Because standardized total effects and direct effects are the same for this model, only the total effects were reported. Only the Internet related IT capacity of Internet2 bandwidth (.905) and Internet1 bandwidth (.569) had standardized total effects on the technological context latent variable greater than .50. Except for a moderate standardized total effect of .429 for obtaining bandwidth from a consortium, all the other technological context indicators had standardized total effects that were low to negligible at best. Since Internet2 is primarily, though not exclusively, utilized more for research purposes, it was startling to find that Internet2 bandwidth had a higher standardized total effect of .905 for teaching oriented institutions than for research oriented institutions. Perhaps this was due to three of the other five technological context indicators having such low standardized total effects. As Internet1 connections with fast speeds are important to using course management systems, learning object repositories, conducting research, and recruiting students to teaching oriented institutions expecting these capabilities, it was not surprising that this indicator had a moderately high standardized total effect on the technological context. Additionally, it was not unexpected to find that obtaining bandwidth from a consortium was important since many teaching oriented institutions rely upon the added purchasing power that comes from participating and joining consortia to acquire IT bandwidth and to make expensive IT purchases. In addition, it was not surprising to find that the number of high performance computers on campus had the lowest total standardized effect of .081 since high performance computing is utilized to conduct sophisticated research which is not a focus of teaching oriented institutions. In looking at the organizational and environmental (OE) context factor, all three indicators had a moderate to high standardized total effect for teaching oriented institutions, emphasizing the importance of this OE context factor as a whole for teaching oriented institutions when considering the impact of TOE theory on IT use. The results related to the size indicator supported the work of Getz, et al. (1996) on the adoption of technological innovations in higher education that size would positively effect the adoption of technology.

Testing the proposed structural model validated the need to do this for the structural model for institutional effectiveness. Therefore, the initial structural model tested was based on this adjustment to the TOE measurement model. Identification. The first step required making sure that the initial structural model was identified (see Evaluation of Model Fit. The evaluation of the fit of the initial structural model showed that the chi square was significant with a chi square of 309.877 and 51 degrees of freedom (df), which was not good, but with a large sample size this was not unexpected.  Respecification. While this model produced an admissible solution, steps were taken to identify alternative theoretically based models with a better model fit based on the exploratory analysis results. Similar to the testing of the TOE measurement model, alternative models were also examined that split up the technological context IT capabilities and IT capacity into latent variables as well as models without various technological context indicators. However, none of those models provided a significantly better fitting theoretically supported model. Therefore, this model was selected as the final and best fitting structural model for testing the institutional effectiveness of research oriented institutions. Interpretation of Results. The results of the final institutional effectiveness structural model for research oriented institutions showed that both structural coefficients for the technological context factor (.504) and for the combined organizational and environmental context factor (.339) on the institutional effectiveness factor were significant at the .01 level (see Table 4."}, {"section_title": "16: IE Structural Standardized Regression", "text": "Weights: Research Institutions). Additionally, the technological context and combined organizational and environmental context were highly correlated at .78. This high correlation emphasized the importance of evaluating both of these two exogenous factors when making decisions related to the institutional effectiveness of a college or university in terms of producing research and learning at research oriented institutions. Note: *** Indicates standardized regression weight for structural coefficient was significant at .001 level. Similar to the TOE measurement model, all of the indicators for the exogenous latent variables had standardized regression weights that were significant at the .001 level except for regulatory support (see Table 4.17: IE Standardized Regression Weights: Research Institutions). Regulatory support was not a significant indicator (.462 p value). Additionally, both endogenous indicators for the institutional effectiveness latent variable of per capita research productivity and learning productivity and these two endogenous indicators were also significant at the .001 level. Note: *** Indicates standardized regression weight for the indicator was significant at the .001 level. Interestingly, the technological context factor actually had a greater standardized total effect of .504 on the institutional effectiveness factor than the combined organizational and environmental context factor of .339 (see Table 4.18: IE Standardized Total Effects: Research Institutions). This highlighted the importance of the technological context and IT infrastructure when making decisions related to the research and learning productivity of research oriented institutions. Furthermore, both indicators of the institutional effectiveness endogenous latent variable had highly positive standardized total effects at .764 for the research productivity in terms of per capita research expenditures and .662 for the learning productivity in terms of the graduation rate of the institution. In terms of the exogenous indicators for the technological context factor and the combined organizational and environmental (OE) context factor, the results were nearly identical to the TOE measurement model results. The two Internet indicators (Internet2 at .784 and Internet1 at .851) had very high standardized total effects on the technological context factor. The other technological context indicators had moderate to low standardized total effects. Once again, regulatory support had a negligible and negative standardized total effect (-.051) on the OE context factor. Alternatively, the other three indicators for this factor of size (.671), potential financial commitment to IT (.980), and competitive pressure (.481) all had moderate to very high standardized total effects on the OE context factor. Financial resources were unsurprisingly very important to research oriented institutions wanting to realize high research and learning productivity. The standardized indirect effects illustrated how much the two exogenous factors affected both endogenous indicators for institutional effectiveness in research oriented institutions (see Table 4.19: IE Standardized Indirect Effects: Research Institutions). The standardized indirect results were somewhat similar for both exogenous factors on both the research productivity and learning productivity indicators, although the technological context factor had a greater standardized indirect effect for both indicators. The OE context factor had a standardized indirect effect of .259 on research productivity while the technological context factor had a positive indirect effect of .385. In relation to learning productivity, the OE context factor had a standardized indirect effect of .224 while the technological context factor had a positive standardized indirect effect of .333. This finding illustrated the importance of the technological context factor on research and learning productivity for research oriented institutions. While the standardized indirect effects showed the impact of both exogenous factors on the two endogenous indicators for institutional effectiveness, it was not clear what direct effects each exogenous indicator had on research and learning productivity when considered in isolation. Therefore, multiple regression was used to illustrate the direct effects of each exogenous indicator on the research productivity indicator and also on the learning productivity indicator. With per capita research productivity serving as the dependent variable, Internet2 bandwidth, maximum network speed, number of high performance computers on campus, size, potential financial commitment to IT, competitive pressure, and regulatory support were all significant predictors (see Table   4.20: IE Indicator Research Productivity Regression: Research Institutions). The standardized regression weights showed that as Internet2 increased by one unit research productivity increased by .209. For maximum network speed a one unit increase led to a .123 increase for research productivity and for high performance computing the result was a .168 increase in research productivity. All three of these IT capacity indicators are very important to conducting sophisticated research and positively affected per capita research productivity. The results confirmed that financial resources are vital to producing more research and a one unit increase resulted in a .322 increase in research productivity. Competitive pressure in terms of prestige was also positively related to greater research productivity leading to a .256 increase in research productivity . Interestingly, size had a negative standardized effect (-.228) on research productivity. This negative effect for size may be explained by the fact that research productivity was a per capita measure which controlled for size (research expenditures were divided by the number of FTE faculty at the institution). Additionally, more prestigious research oriented institutions are typically smaller, but at least medium sized, than the largest public research oriented institutions. Furthermore, prestigious research oriented institutions have greater financial resources  to acquire greater Internet2 and high performance computing capacity and faster network connections. As a result, prestigious institutions, with greater financial resources and IT infrastructure would produce more research than larger, less prestigious institutions, with fewer financial and IT resources available to them. This model explained 47 percent of the variance for per capita research productivity for research oriented institutions. With learning productivity (undergraduate graduation rate) serving as the dependent variable, once again size, potential financial commitment to IT, and competitive pressure were all significant predictors (see Table 4.21: IE Indicator Learning Productivity Regression: Research Institutions). No technological context indicator was significant. This finding illustrated that the organizational and environmental context was much more relevant to consider when making decisions related to student learning at research oriented institutions. This model explained 69 percent of the variance for learning productivity for research oriented institutions. Predictably, competitive pressure led to the greatest standardized increase in learning productivity (.572). More prestigious institutions attract students who typically have greater financial resources to support them through school, have higher test scores, and are typically better prepared for college. As a result, students at more prestigious institutions are more likely to graduate. The results also confirmed that greater financial resources (.388) of the institution were also vital to supporting students and helping them to learn and to graduate. Additionally, the results showed that as size (.-368) increases students become less likely to graduate. This finding may result from students at larger institutions being less likely to become socially involved, a factor which positively influences educational attainment (Pascarella & Terenzini, 1991)."}, {"section_title": "Teaching Oriented Institution Institutional Effectiveness Structural Model", "text": "Just as with the research oriented institutions, the testing of the TOE measurement model showed a need to alter the proposed model for the SEM for the Institutional Effectiveness structural model for teaching oriented institutions by combining the organizational and environmental context latent variables into a single factor while also removing potential financial commitment to IT as an indicator from this factor. Testing the proposed structural model validated the need to do this for the structural model for institutional effectiveness as no admissible model solution was reached. Therefore, the organizational and environmental context latent variables were combined. Based on the TOE measurement model results, the potential financial commitment to IT and dark fiber connection to buildings indicators were removed for the initial institutional effectiveness structural model for teaching oriented institutions as well (see Identification. The first step required making sure that the initial structural model was identified. Since this was a structural model, not a measurement model, scale dependency was handled by fixing a loading on each of the three latent variables (technological context, organizational context, and environmental context) to \"1\". The institutional effectiveness structural model passed the t-rule with 42 degrees of freedom for this model. As indicated previously, the TOE measurement model for teaching oriented institutions already passed as an identified model. The structural model also passed the two indicator rule and was recursive with unidirectional causal flow. Therefore, this structural model was identified. Evaluation of Model Fit. This initial model did not produce an admissible solution because of an extreme negative variance for the learning productivity error term. To try and isolate the problem, size, competitive pressure, and regulatory support were The only solution that worked for an institutional effectiveness model for teaching oriented institution was to place a regression weight on the structural parameter linking the technological context factor to the institutional effectiveness factor (see Fig 4.9: Final Institutional Effectiveness Structural Model: Teaching Institutions). While a smaller regression weight of at least .346 also worked, prior theory was not available to serve as a guide for setting a regression weight. Therefore, since a regression weight was necessary for this model to run, the researcher chose to use a regression weight of \"1\" because this regression weight was simpler to interpret.  In reality, the structural coefficient for this parameter was smaller, but not by much, when a regression weight of .346 was used instead of \"1\" on this structural parameter connecting technological context to institutional effectiveness. Taking these steps illustrated, that the combined organizational and environmental context factor dominated the model in terms of explaining the institutional effectiveness factor. In fact, the correlation in this final model was actually -.01 between the technological context factor and the organizational and environmental context factor."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 5 Discussion", "text": "This study tested a structural model to explore the influence of information technology (IT) on the research productivity (per capita full time faculty research expenditures) and the learning productivity (undergraduate graduation rate) of a college or university.

A research oriented institution structural model was compared to a teaching oriented institution structural model to determine if there were any significant differences between the two structural models. In making these comparisons, it should be noted that results for the initial TOE measurement models were very similar to the results for the TOE factors comprising the foundation for the full institutional effectiveness structural model so only the full structural model comparisons will be made. Also, as mentioned previously, it was necessary to place a regression weight on the structural parameter linking the technological context factor to the institutional effectiveness factor in order to produce an admissible model solution for the teaching oriented institution model. Therefore, the results of the models are not identical to begin with. Additionally, the high correlation of .86 between size and potential financial commitment to IT (financial resources) led to the decision to use size as a proxy for financial commitment to IT (Rogers, 1995). Consequently, the potential financial commitment to IT indicator is not in both models. All other indicators were similar."}, {"section_title": "TOE Measurement Model Comparisons", "text": "Since the TOE measurement model served as the foundation for the full institutional effectiveness structural model, this section of the final full institutional effectiveness structural model for research and teaching oriented institutions will be compared first. Perhaps most noteworthy of all in terms of demonstrating the difference between the focus of research oriented institutions compared to teaching oriented institutions was the difference between the standardized direct effects of the number of high performance computers on campus on the technological context factor. The standardized direct effects of high performance computing on the technological context factor for research oriented institutions was .503 while it was only .083 at teaching oriented institutions. With high performance computing important to conducting sophisticated research, not teaching, this should not be surprising, but does greatly illustrate the difference between teaching oriented and research oriented institutions. Other differences for the standardized direct effects, though not as large, between the indicators for the technological context were observed for dark fiber to ISP (.390 for research compared to .154 for teaching) Internet2 bandwidth (.784 for research to compared to .967 for teaching), Internet1 bandwidth (.851 for research compared to .535 for teaching), and maximum network speed (.410 for research compared to .108 for teaching). Obtaining bandwidth from a consortium was very similar for both (.340 for research compared to .372 for teaching). Unsurprisingly, except for Internet2 bandwidth, the indicators in the research oriented institution model had higher standardized direct effects on the technological context factor. This difference of the higher standardized direct effect of Internet2 bandwidth, which is used almost exclusively for research, in the teaching oriented institution model compared to the research oriented institution model may be more a result of the fact that all indicators of the technological context factor for research oriented institutions had at least moderate (lowest of .340) standardized direct effects on the technological context factor, while three of the six indicators had small standardized direct effects (dark fiber to ISP at .154, maximum speed of the network at .108, and number of high performance computers on campus at .083) on the technological context factor for the teaching oriented institution model. The Internet2 (.967) and Internet1 (.535) bandwidth as well as obtaining bandwidth from a consortium (.372) were the only indicators with moderate to high standardized direct effects in the teaching oriented institution model. Since potential financial commitment to IT was not included in the teaching oriented institution model, size was used as a proxy for this measure (Rogers, 1995). Size had a relatively high standardized direct effect (.487) on the organizational and environmental context factor of the teaching oriented institution model. This supported the earlier work of Getz, et al., (1996) that found larger size positively affects the adoption and use of technology in teaching oriented institutions. However, size did not have as large of a standardized direct effect in teaching oriented institutions compared to research oriented institutions. The standardized direct effects of size (.692) and potential financial commitment to IT (.956) were both greater in the research oriented institution model, which also supported the findings of Getz, et al., (1996)  However, despite this difference it was clear to see that the impact of competitive pressure and regulatory support on IT use was very different for teaching oriented institutions compared to research oriented institutions. For research oriented institutions, competitive pressure had a moderate positive standardized direct effect of .481 on the organizational and environmental context factor while competitive pressure had a highly negative effect of -.902 on the same factor for teaching oriented institutions (for the teaching oriented institution TOE measurement model without the institutional effectiveness factor included, the standardized direct effects were more moderate at -.550 but still illustrated this inverse relationship). Teaching oriented institutions facing greater competitive pressure (in terms of prestige) have been reluctant to utilize IT to reach beyond a primarily residential student body. Larger teaching oriented institutions which face lower competitive pressure (in terms of prestige), are more likely to need to utilize IT to serve their student body. These institutions would typically have a greater mix of residential and commuter students. On the other hand, research oriented institutions facing greater competitive pressure would be focused on the research outcome and recognize the importance of technology in conducting sophisticated research. As competitive pressure (prestige) rose, technological resources necessary to also produce greater amounts of sophisticated research were positively related as well. Therefore, the finding that competitive pressure in terms of prestige had an inverse relationship for the research oriented institution model compared to the teaching oriented institution model would make theoretical sense. In regards to regulatory support, it was clear that the state government had a greater influence on the use of IT at a teaching oriented institution (.486) than at a research oriented institution (-.051). As a reminder, the regulatory support measure accounted for the differences between public and private institutions to allow for both types to be included in an analysis. With this in mind, the words of higher education consultants Rowley and Sherman (2001) offered insights that could explain the large discrepancy between teaching and research oriented institutions for the regulatory support measure. Teaching oriented public institutions are typically smaller in size, have smaller resource bases, place less emphasis on research so they receive fewer research dollars, and are more dependent on state appropriations. This constrains them based on the fluctuations in state issues and taxes. Furthermore, Rowley and Sherman (2001) stated that teaching oriented public institutions also live in the shadow of the more research oriented flagship and larger state universities unless alumni or other friends of the university happen to be in leadership positions and influence legislators to prioritize resources in favor of the smaller public institution. Based on the earlier work of Zumeta (1996) and more recent work of Volkwein and Sweitzer (2006), private institutions also face varying degrees of state policy regulatory pressures. Though not separated in this study from public institutions, private teaching oriented institutions also appear to be more heavily influenced by state government regulations and control than private research oriented institutions in the use of IT. In sum, the level of regulatory support was clearly more important at teaching oriented institutions than at research oriented institutions for state policy decisions related to IT use."}, {"section_title": "Institutional Effectiveness Structural Model Comparisons", "text": "In looking at the full structural model that includes the institutional effectiveness factor, not just the foundational TOE measurement model, three significant differences were apparent between the research oriented and teaching oriented institution models. First of all, the correlations between the two exogenous factors, the technological context factor and the organizational and environmental context factor, differed greatly. Using TOE theory as a guide, it appeared that that when examining both the technological context factor and the organizational and environmental context factor (OE) context factor of teaching oriented institutions, TOE did not do nearly as much to explain IT use for teaching oriented institutions as it did for the research oriented institutions since the technological context factor and OE context factor were not closely related. For the research oriented institution model there was a high correlation of .78 between the two exogenous factors while this correlation was negligible and slightly negative at -.01 between the same two factors in the teaching oriented institution model. Secondly, the structural coefficients for the two exogenous factors on the institutional effectiveness endogenous factor varied significantly as well. For the research oriented institution model, the technological context factor had a much higher standardized direct effect of .504 on institutional effectiveness compared to .103 in the teaching oriented institution model. Conversely, the organizational and environmental context factor for the research oriented institution model was much lower at .339 compared to .899 in the teaching oriented institution model. Finally, the standardized indirect effects of the two exogenous factors on the two indicators for the institutional effectiveness endogenous factor of research productivity and learning productivity showed very telling differences. Beginning with research productivity, in the research oriented institution model, the technological context factor had a much higher standardized indirect effect of .385 on research productivity compared to the marginal standardized indirect effect of .018 in the teaching oriented institution model. Clearly, the technological context has a much greater impact on research productivity at research oriented institutions. For the organizational and environmental (OE) context factor, in the research oriented institution model the OE factor had a higher standardized indirect effect on research productivity of .259 compared to .156 in the teaching oriented institution model. With learning productivity, the standardized indirect effects also differed for research oriented institutions compared to teaching oriented institutions. The technological context for the research oriented model had a greater standardized indirect effect of .333 on learning productivity compared to -.093 in the teaching oriented institution model. Alternatively, while negative, the standardized indirect effects of the organizational and environmental context (OE) factor on learning productivity were much greater in the teaching oriented model with the OE context having a highly negative standardized indirect effect (-.805) on learning productivity compared to a much smaller as well as positive standardized indirect effect (.224) in the research oriented institution model. In sum, the results of the standardized indirect effects illustrated that research oriented institutions realized joint productivity increases from utilizing the IT resources of the institution in terms of both research and learning productivity. On the other hand, teaching oriented institutions were minimally impacted by the IT resources of the institution. The organizational and environmental (OE) context had somewhat similar standardized indirect effects on research productivity for both groups of institutions. However, the OE context had vastly different effects on learning productivity, highly negative standardized indirect effects in teaching oriented institutions and positive yet small standardized indirect effects in research oriented institutions. These overall findings may suggest that the technological context is not an important focus of colleges or universities with a teaching orientation. Rather, the resources of teaching oriented institutions are more focused on supporting other factors that are not significantly impacted by IT use and the technological context of the institution."}, {"section_title": "Implications for Higher Education Policymakers and Administrators", "text": "This study provided data that will aid policy makers and administrators in making decisions regarding purchasing new IT resources as well as supporting the current IT infrastructure of the institution.

Researchers are heavily dependent upon IT to conduct sophisticated research. The rapid expansion of computing capacity has led to the development of new sciences such as quantum computing, molecular computers, and biocomputing (Duderstadt, et al., 2002;Duderstadt & Womack, 2003). Future scientific advances in areas such as weather predictions and climate modeling will require highperformance computers (Gunzburger & Wilgenbusch, 2007). Research institutions wishing to work at the leading edge of scholarship must have the Internet and network capacity in place to do so (Law, 2000). Robust, high speed networks are absolutely essential for colleges and universities because they are knowledge driven institutions. Faculty with high performance computing and with greater computing capacity available to them will have greater capabilities to perform sophisticated research experiments (Bement, 2007;Duderstadt, et al., 2002;Duderstadt & Womack, 2003;Gunzburger & Wilgenbusch, 2007). For example, high performance computers such as the \"Ranger\" supercomputer at the University of Texas at Austin's Texas Advanced Computing Center, which is able to complete 504 trillion calculations per second, will become more important to allowing research oriented institutions to conduct sophisticated research. However, super computers such as the Ranger come with at a significant expense with hardware costs of $30 million and staffing and maintenance costs for the machine running nearly as high (Read, 2007). In this case, the National Science Foundation provided the funding. Therefore, consortia arrangements or funding from the federal government or even private industry may be more and more necessary to enable the purchase as well as the ongoing maintenance and support for super computers as well as other IT infrastructure of colleges and universities in the future as well. Research oriented institutions clearly benefit from and as a result should seek ways to utilize the IT infrastructure of the institution to help students learn. While the prevailing view about faculty's research activity is that it dominates their time to the detriment of instruction, research has shown that there can be a \"symbiotic relationship\" between teaching and research by incorporating undergraduate students into their research activity as assistants (Rhoades, 2001). This study showed that the IT resources of an institution can be utilized to facilitate this symbiotic relationship between teaching and research and lead to joint production of these two outcomes of interest. For example, while Internet2 is typically thought of as a connection for conducting research, research oriented institutions can also utilize Internet2 to provide teaching opportunities for students as well. Other sophisticated IT tools could also be utilized to offer learning opportunities by providing the virtual connections and tools and capabilities to collaborate with other faculty, students and/or researchers in foreign countries (Friedman, 2005). Course management systems, learning object repositories, and other learning or instructional technologies can also aid student learning (Bates, 2000;Simonson, et al., 2003;Wiley, 2002)."}, {"section_title": "Implications Regarding Teaching Oriented Institutions", "text": "Policymakers and administrators at teaching oriented institutions can also utilize these findings at their institutions as well. The results from this study showed that the technological context and IT use had a much smaller affect on the research and learning productivity of teaching oriented institutions. The results illustrated that focusing on the organizational and environmental context was of much greater importance in explaining the research and particularly the learning productivity in terms of the graduation rate of teaching oriented institutions. Non IT related resources dedicated to supporting faculty and students, such as student affairs and other student support organizations on campus, should continue to be the focal point of teaching oriented institutions with a focus on helping students to learn and to graduate. The results showed that the more expensive IT infrastructure comprising the technological context of teaching oriented institutions such as high performance computing was not important to teaching oriented institutions. However, having faster and higher bandwidth Internet2 and Internet1 connections were significant indicators in the final teaching oriented institution structural model. The IT infrastructure has increasingly become a recruiting tool for faculty and students with colleges and universities competing for high rank in terms of the IT infrastructure of the institution (Duderstadt & Womack, 2003;Slaughter & Rhoades, 2004). Therefore, the IT infrastructure of a teaching oriented institution cannot be ignored. Faculty and students expect to have high speed Internet connections, though as is widely known, these high speed connections are not necessarily desired purely for learning or research purposes but also for personal uses to watch or download rich multimedia files as well. Nevertheless, high speed Internet connectivity serves as a recruitment tool for teaching oriented institutions. Additionally, it was clear that regulatory support, related to IT, is much more important for teaching oriented institutions than for research oriented institutions. Research oriented institutions typically enjoy greater autonomy to make their own decisions. Additionally, research oriented institutions receive greater financial support from the state in terms of dollars, but this dollar amount is typically smaller in terms of total expenditures of the institutions because research oriented institutions also receive significant funding from other sources including the federal government, corporations, as well as friends and alumni of the institution. Therefore, a supportive regulatory environment is much more important to teaching oriented institutions which are more reliant upon the state where the institution is located for funding and support. Teaching oriented institutions, except for some of the larger masters (comprehensive) oriented institutions that have a greater research orientation, do not require high performance computing on campus and significant IT capacity and capabilities on campus necessary to conduct sophisticated research. However, instructional technologies, many of which rely on necessary network and computing capabilities, have frequently been used to increase student learning and ability to perform in the classroom (Young, 2005). Faculty utilize instructional technologies to teach certain concepts and principles to students outside of the classroom, which frees up time to utilize more interactive teaching methods during class time (Staley, 2000). Teaching oriented institutions should make efforts to utilize instructional technologies such as learning objects to increase learning and assist students in successfully completing bottleneck courses such as algebra or English. Learning objects allow learners to access high quality instructional materials at any time and place (Wiley, 2002). Instructional technologies provide a learning environment just as effective as traditional classroom instruction (Simonson, et al., 2003;Young, 2005) and in many cases not only increase access, but also increase retention and course completion (Farmer, 2004). Instructional technologies allow for team teaching with guest faculty and/or students from other institutions (Bates, 2000). Instructional technologies are also used to aid in the development of higher order learning skills (Milrad, et al., 2003). Interaction structured through online communications provides more flexibility and greater access to other students and the teachers. As colleges or universities expand their network capacity and as overall bandwidth increases, teaching oriented institutions can also significantly reduce video conferencing costs and provide sophisticated virtual collaboration opportunities. Collaboration opportunities also are enabled by participating in consortia. These consortia allow colleges and universities to collaborate with other consortia members to better understand how to implement and utilize the technologies they share in order to make informed decisions in relation to IT investments (Duderstadt & Womack, 2003). In short, teaching oriented institutions should still consider IT to be a valuable tool to enable the institution to accomplish its teaching mission while also recognizing that IT will not have the same impact as it does for research oriented institutions."}, {"section_title": "Implications Regarding Research and Teaching Oriented Institutions", "text": "With states limiting revenue increases in campus budgets and reducing overall allocations to colleges and universities, finding money for IT after trying to fund other priorities such as faculty, staff, and other resources of the institution can be very difficult. As a result, students are being asked to bear more of the burden of additional technology funding. Students are increasingly being charged technology fees in addition to their tuition as a part of their educational costs to support the IT infrastructure, computer labs, and other IT resources of the institution (Hirth, 2006). Many campuses are also requiring students to purchase their own laptops and/or hand held PDA or computer devices along with necessary software and electronic textbooks as a part of their educational programs of study. With tuition rates already rising at a pace faster than inflation, any new additional technology costs for students adds to their financial burden to obtain a college degree. Additional technology based fees will likely have a negative effect on lower SES students with fewer financial resources to pay these additional fees. Therefore, colleges and universities should carefully consider the impact that adding additional technology based fees will have on their students' ability to pay for their education and seek alternatives where possible to avoid adding on to the growing financial burden already required of students to obtain a college degree."}, {"section_title": "Suggestions for Future Research", "text": "While TOE theory has been tested quite extensively in the private sector, research related to the technological, organizational, and environmental (TOE) factors that affect IT use as well as the impact of IT use on the research and learning productivity of higher education institutions has not been extensively examined. This study served as an exploration into this area by testing a structural model based on TOE theory as a foundation and institutional effectiveness, in terms of the research productivity and learning productivity of higher education institutions, as the outcome of interest. While this study provided greater insights related to the affect of the TOE factors and impact of IT use on research and learning, additional research should be completed regarding the study variables to provide greater understanding in this area. Suggestions for future studies are provided next. Employ a longitudinal design to test the final structural models. This study was exploratory in nature and tested Zhu and Kraemer's (2005) model specific to the retail industry in higher education. As such, it is important to consider limitations related to this being an exploratory study. One limitation includes the existence of equivalent models (MacCallum et al., 1993). Equivalent models are possible. Therefore, the research generated and examined equivalent models as part of this study in addition to the final model selected. TOE theory supports the fact that the TOE indicators (IT capabilities, IT capacity, size, financial resources, competitive pressure, and regulatory support) are exogenous/input variables and not plausibly caused by the endogenous/outcome indicators of research and learning productivity. The employment of longitudinal designs in future studies will also help to rule out equivalent models that violate time precedence. As future versions of the SSERF biannual survey are made publicly available, employing a longitudinal design in the future is feasible. Given that the initial proposed model was modified as a result of this study, conducting a longitudinal study will also allow for cross-validation of the final model. Since this study was not under the experimental control of the researcher and relied upon publicly available data sources, it will not be possible to experimentally manipulate key variables in the model in a program of research. Additionally, it is important to be guarded about making causal inferences related to structural equation models. Structural models should be interpreted cautiously because \"criteria for comparing models and assessing goodness-of-fit indices are relative and not absolute\" and the \"fact that a particular sample fits a model does not confirm that the model is a good representation of reality\" (Stewart & Segars, 2002, p. 45). Structural models should only be \"viewed as scientific evidence to the extent that they can be replicated in subsequent studies\" (Stewart & Segars, 2002, p. 45). Conduct the study with a greater sample size. A power analysis was conducted for both the research oriented institution and teaching oriented institution models. The sample size and degrees of freedom (df) for each model were compared to a table provided by MacCallum, et al., (1996) for determining the power for a not-close fit for a structural model. MacCallum, et al., (1996) recommended using a not-close fit test. They rounded sample size to the nearest 100 and degrees of freedom to the nearest five. Hence, for this study, the power for some models was rounded down meaning that the power reported was lower for each model than it really was for each model examined (see Table   5.1: Power Analysis for Final Models). In other words, there were actually 219 (not 200) research oriented institutions and 166 (not 100) teaching oriented institutions included in the study. Although the power analysis for this study showed that no final model had a power of .80 or higher, the structural coefficients still provide insights about each structural model which should be considered in future research efforts. In short, a longitudinal study with a larger sample size testing these theoretical constructs would provide greater understanding to research in this area. Test four separate mission based models instead of two combined mission models. Getz, et. al., (1997) in their study of the adoption of innovations (including IT) in higher education separated their sample of colleges and universities into four groups based on the mission of the institution: research, doctoral, comprehensive (masters), and liberal arts (baccalaureate). Unfortunately, there were not a sufficient number (i.e. minimum 150) of institutions in the SSERF to use these four distinct groups as comparison groups in a structural equation model (Schumaker & Lomax, 1996). As a result, the research and doctoral institutions were combined into a research oriented group while the comprehensive and liberal arts institutions were combined into a teaching oriented group. If sample size permits, testing the structural model based on these four different missions would enable policy makers and decision makers to get a better idea of how the model related to their institution. Test the model with specific indicators describing the extent of IT usage. The structural model tested in this study was based on Zhu and Kraemer's (2005)  Questions asked by Zhu and Kraemer (2005) to find out the extent of IT usage in the respondent organization were: percent of consumer sales conducted online, percent of business-to-business sales conducted online, percent of goods for resale ordered online, and percent of supplies and equipment for doing business ordered online. While these questions in the SSERF or perhaps even in IPEDS would need to be adapted to a higher education setting, knowing the extent of IT usage of the IT infrastructure that was analyzed in the survey would add greater depth to the understanding in this area.

Instructional technologies provide a learning environment just as effective as traditional classroom instruction (Simonson, et al., 2003;Young, 2005) and in many cases not only increase access, but also increase retention and course completion (Farmer, 2004). Therefore, to improve the quality of undergraduate education, the Spellings report written by the National Commission on the Future of Higher Education Additionally, information technology has and will continue to be important tools for conducting and advancing scientific research (Duderstadt, 2007;Gunzburger & Wilgenbusch, 2007). Computing and networking capacities are predicted to evolve at rates of a thousand fold every decade or faster. The rapid expansion of computing capacity has led to the development of new sciences such as quantum computing, molecular computers, and biocomputing (Duderstadt, et al., 2002;Duderstadt & Womack, 2003). In the 21 st century with terabit per second networks soon transporting data at the equivalent rate of over one thousand miles per hour, there will soon exist what Bell laboratories calls a \"global communications skin\" linking billions of computers handling the routine tasks of society (Duderstadt & Womack, 2003). These technological developments make it important for colleges and universities to have the new technologies available in order to study and further expand research in these new sciences. The National Science Foundation has emphasized the importance that American colleges and universities better utilize IT resources in order for the United States to maintain its status as the leader in advancing and developing new research and knowledge not just in the sciences, but also in the humanities and the arts (Bement, 2007). Clearly US government agencies have recognized the importance of utilizing IT resources to advance and develop research and to develop new or better methods of teaching and content delivery to increase student learning. However, IT is very expensive and other campus resources are important to colleges and universities as well. Furthermore, states have become less inclined to provide funding necessary to public universities and have increased focus on other social priorities such as crime prevention, health care, and K-12 education (Duderstadt, 2007;Duderstadt & Womack, 2003). States have limited revenue increases in campus budgets and reduced overall allocations to colleges and universities. Both private and public universities have had to find other funding sources to make up for declining financial support from the government (Duderstadt, 2007;Kerr, 2001). With resources being limited, calls for institutional effectiveness and accountability by stakeholders have increased for colleges and universities. With IT costs expected to increase at significant rates (Kiernan, 2006), the funding of IT has become a key issue for colleges and universities to address for the foreseeable future (Camp & Dubloy, 2007). With an ever increasing amount of spending on information technology, this study served as an exploratory analysis to answer the question, \"What are the benefits and improvements created by IT in higher education?\" In short, are these IT expenditures well spent with a sound return on investment? Although targeted towards the private sector, Carr (2003) questioned whether information technology really mattered in gaining a strategic advantage over competitors while Collins (2001) found technology made a competitive difference in his extensive research efforts. For research oriented institutions, this study clearly supported Collins (2001) work in the private sector. IT makes a substantial difference in realizing joint production of research and learning productivity in these institutions. Research oriented colleges and universities should view IT as an investment and a strategic asset critical to the fundamental academic mission and quality of the institution. However, colleges and universities have traditionally looked at information technology as merely a capital expenditure or an experimental tool (Duderstadt, et al., 2002). On the other hand, while IT should not be ignored completely, teaching oriented institutions should treat IT as less of a strategic priority. In sum, the technological context had a much greater affect on institutional effectiveness in terms of the research and learning productivity of research oriented institutions than in teaching oriented institutions. Additionally, the technological context factor and organizational and environmental context factor were much more highly correlated in research oriented institutions than in teaching oriented institutions. Therefore, the technological context of research oriented institutions is very important to consider when making decisions related to the purchase of new IT resources as well as supporting and maintaining the IT infrastructure of the institution as well. IT use is important in order to realize research and learning productivity in research oriented institutions while playing a much smaller role in realizing these two outcomes in teaching oriented institutions. This does not mean IT is not of value to teaching oriented institutions, but rather that IT as a strategic priority should not be as much of a focal point in making long term strategic decisions related to research and learning. Instead, teaching oriented institutions should focus more on the organizational and environmental context of the institution. Non IT related resources dedicated to supporting faculty and students, such as student affairs and other supportive organizations of the campus, should continue to be the focal point of teaching oriented institutions to help students to learn and to graduate. This is not to say that students should not be a focal point of research oriented institutions. However, neglecting the import of IT to research oriented institutions to fulfill a research oriented mission will prove costly. Future studies should build upon the findings of this study to advance the understanding and knowledge of the factors that affect IT use in higher education and how IT use impacts institutional effectiveness in relation to the research productivity (per capita research expenditures) and learning productivity (undergraduate graduation rates) of research and teaching oriented colleges and universities.
