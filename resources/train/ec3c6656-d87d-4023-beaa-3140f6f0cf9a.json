First, we divided 256 pairs of seed regions from each hemisphere covering the entire cerebral gray matter.

By directly comparing the patients with MCI with the patients with AD, an exclusive abnormal rightward laterality was observed in the patients with MCI within the 0.2 \u2264 |iLI| < 0.4 threshold, and the normal leftward asymmetry vanished in the patients with AD within the |iLI| \u2265 0.8 threshold. conclusion: Global brain lateralization was different among three groups. The abnormal rightward dominance observed in the patients with MCI and AD may indicate that these patients use additional brain resources to compensate for the loss of cognitive function, and the observed disappearance of the leftward laterality in the patients with AD was likely associated with the damage in the left hemisphere. The observed disappearance of the rightward asymmetry in the patients with AD using the 0.2 \u2264 |iLI| < 0.4 threshold was likely a sign of decompensation.

Regarding brain laterality, the left hemisphere is more specialized in language processing (1, 2) , while the right hemisphere is more specialized in attention, musical abilities, visuospatial tasks, and many aspects of emotion (3, 4) . Regarding brain structural asymmetries, the left hemisphere has a larger planum temporale, the right hemisphere has a larger hippocampus and the lateral fissure in the left hemisphere is longer than that in the right hemisphere (5-7). In addition, the degree of the structural asymmetry was found to be correlated with the degree of functional lateralization in right-handed individuals (8) . Bidu\u0142a also revealed that there were significant associations between the anatomical asymmetries in the insular cortex and the lateralization of functional activity in both gesture planning and language (Pearson's r = 0.6, r = 0.49) (9).\nBrain asymmetry is believed to be evolutionarily adaptive. Functional specialization that primarily involves processing within one hemisphere may allow the expanded human brain to minimize between-hemisphere connectivity and distribute domain-specific processing functions (10) . Furthermore, hemispheric specialization is hypothesized to contribute to rapid and efficient information processing (11, 12) .\nHemispheric asymmetries have been shown to change in healthy aging as follows: when performing a cognitive task, the activity in the frontal lobes in healthy elderly subjects is less lateralized than that in young subjects (13, 14) . In addition, brain injury or neurological disorders in which the anatomical and functional integrity of the brain are impaired, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and schizophrenia, also result in alterations in brain asymmetry (15) (16) (17) (18) . Hippocampal asymmetry was found to be significantly reduced in subjects with dementia (15) . Additionally, Long et al. showed that compared with healthy elderly subjects, age-matched groups of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD featured a greater progressive loss of structural asymmetry in the causal anterior cingulate cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and entorhinal cortex (19) . Although the cortical structural asymmetry pattern observed in healthy elderly subjects was generally maintained in the patients with MCI and AD, there was a progressive decrease in the degree of asymmetry (20) .

(3) Rigid body corrections were implemented for head motion (six-parameter rigid body) and datasets with more than 1.5 mm of maximum displacement in any of the x, y, or z directions or 1.5\u00b0 of any angular motion were discarded, resulting in the exclusion of three subjects (one HC and two patients with AD).

According to these four seed-target correlations, iLI was then calculated using the following equation:\nLaterality Index= LL RL RR LR\nLL is the strength of the correlation between the lefthemisphere target region and the left-hemisphere seed region; LR represents the strength of correlation between the left seed and the right target; and RR and RL represent the contralateral homologs.

When the denominator was less than 0.2, iLI was set to 0. The iLI was computed for all 256 seed regions in each hemisphere against the 255 possible target regions; we also set the iLI of each pair of seed region against itself to 0, yielding 65,536 pairwise correlations for each subject.

Our study compared the iLI of three groups and investigated the sum, number and mean values of the iLI in 256 pairs of seed regions based on spontaneous brain activity. We observed differences in the patterns of brain lateralization among the HCs, patients with MCI and patients with AD. Moreover, according to the paired-samples t-test, the alterations in brain lateralization between the patients with MCI and the HCs were different than the alterations observed between the patients with AD and the HCs. These findings provide new insights that may improve our understanding of the two types of neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, hemispheric lateralization was calculated according to the iLI, which was significantly different among the three groups. A previous study revealed that the whole-brain lateralization in healthy elderly subjects had a leftward predominance. Figure 4 reveals that the peaks of iLI among the three groups are all on the right side of 0, indicating a leftward tendency. The pattern of brain functional lateralization in healthy elderly subjects may be related to language dominance. The specialization of the left hemisphere in language was one of the earliest observations of brain asymmetry (27) . The planum temporale, which is an extension of Wernicke's posterior receptive language area, exhibits a marked leftward volume asymmetry; the left planum temporale is up to 10 times larger than its right hemisphere counterpart in humans. This form of asymmetry is perhaps the most prominent and functionally significant form of human brain asymmetry (28) . In addition, the leftward specialization in language is related to the degree of right-handedness, and approximately 97% of righthanded individuals show left-hemisphere speech and language localization (29) . All participants in this study were right-handed and showed leftward lateralization in the most left-lateralized threshold, indicating that this asymmetry may be related to the leftward dominance of language.\nA decrease in the hemispheric asymmetry during disease progression has consistently been reported in studies using electroencephalography, near-infrared spectroscopy, and MRI (30) (31) (32) (33) . This observation was also confirmed in this study. In the present study, the normal leftward lateralization observed in the most left-lateralized threshold (|iLI| \u2265 0.8) in healthy elderly subjects and patients with MCI disappeared in the patients with AD likely due to the disease-induced damage in the left hemispheric cortex. The left hemisphere has been reported to be more susceptible to neurodegenerative diseases than the right hemisphere (34) (35) (36) (37) . In patients with AD, the gray matter loss initially emerges in the entorhinal and temporal-parietal cortices and progresses into the frontal and sensorimotor territories as the disease progresses. This sequence occurs in both hemispheres, but regions in the left hemisphere are affected earlier and more severely. The loss of gray matter in the left hemisphere occurs more rapidly than the loss in the right hemisphere (0.79% per year faster) (34) . In patients with MCI, the atrophy in the gray matter in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and entorhinal cortex was more severe in the left hemisphere than that in the right hemisphere. This result was also consistent with the findings of our previous study, which showed an asymmetric loss of gray matter in the left medial temporal lobe during the progression of MCI to AD, and the loss of gray matter in the left hemisphere was much more severe (35) (36) (37) .\nThe disappearance of the normal leftward lateralization in the patients with AD may serve as a biomarker of the substantial loss of left-lateralized nerve cells. MCI is the preclinical stage of AD, and different AD stages may have different neural mechanisms. Patients with AD may present with the typical brain changes and symptoms that are manifested in patients with AD, but patients with MCI may show slight changes and symptoms compared to patients with AD. The loss of gray matter in patients with MCI might primarily occur in the left medial temporal lobe rather than in most of the left hemisphere; therefore, the left-lateralized pattern still exists.\nWe also observed some abnormal right-lateralized thresholds in the patients with MCI and AD. The rightward lateralization in the patients with MCI and AD may be reflected as (1) a relative increase in brain activation within the right hemisphere or (2) a relative decrease in brain activation within the left hemisphere. Besides the differences we observed among the groups using the one-way ANOVA, a trend of increased brain activation within the right hemisphere was observed in the patients with MCI compared with healthy elderly subjects as shown in Tables 2 and 3 .\nMild cognitive impairment is considered a transitional stage between healthy aging and early AD. MCI is a stage of progressive global cognitive decline, including the loss of memory, reasoning, and language. Abnormalities in functional integrity and functional compensation coexist in patients with MCI. The right-lateralized characteristics observed in patients with MCI may primarily result from an attempt to compensate, indicating a relative increase in brain activation within the right hemisphere. Increased activity or functional connectivity within the right hemisphere has been observed in patients with MCI at resting state or during various cognitive tasks (38) (39) (40) (41) . In attentiondemanding tasks, patients with MCI exhibit a greater activation in the bilateral posterior parietal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices than healthy elderly subjects, but the degree to which the activation was increased was greater in the right hemisphere than that in the left hemisphere. In a word memory task, patients with MCI showed a significant increase in the activation of many compensatory regions than HCs; most regions were located in the right hemisphere (38) (39) (40) . According to a study by Liang et al., patients with MCI may use additional neural resources in the right prefrontal regions to compensate for the losses in cognitive functions (42) . This increased activation in the right hemisphere was consistent with the results of our present study to a certain extent because we observed an abnormal right-lateralized pattern in the patients with MCI. Although compensation for brain function was observed in both hemispheres in the patients with MCI in our study, the right hemisphere was likely dominant over the left hemisphere.\nThe reason for the abnormal right-lateralized pattern might be more complex in patients with AD that in patients with MCI. Compared with the HCs, the mean values of both the sum and number of the left-lateralized or right-lateralized iLI were decreased in the patients with AD using the 0.4 \u2264 |iLI| < 0.8 threshold. These decreases may be due to the interaction among the atrophy in the cortex in the left hemisphere (35, 36) , the compensation for global cognitive function, and the inability to compensate (39, 43, 44) . First, the extensive loss of left-lateralized nerve cells that results in atrophy in the cortex in the left hemisphere may decrease brain activation within the left hemisphere and trigger a relative increase in brain activation within the right hemisphere. Moreover, in semantic and episodic tasks, patients with AD have been shown to recruit bilateral prefrontal cortices rather than the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, which is recruited in HCs, and the recruitment of the bilateral prefrontal regions may reflect a more general adaptation to the loss of cognitive resources (45) (46) (47) (48) . This type of compensation may also enhance right hemispheric activation. In addition, compensation breakdown has been observed in patients with AD (39, 43, 44) . Based on the results of our present study, the normal leftward lateralization pattern observed in the HCs and patients with MCI disappeared in the patients with AD; the reduced asymmetry impeded compensation and the interaction between the hemispheres, impairing the working efficiency of the brain (49) . Based on the discussion presented above, this impairment may affect brain lateralization. The primary cause of the observed rightlateralized alterations in the patients with AD remains unclear and provides motivation for our further studies.\nPrevious studies revealed that gender differences may influence brain asymmetry; however, the results were controversial. Herron and colleagues found males had a larger amygdala, with subtle differences in some cortical regions as well (50) . In another study, Luders et al. considered regional hemispheric differences to be slightly pronounced in males compared with females in most regions of the cortex; however, statistical tests revealed there was no significant interaction between gender and hemisphere (51) . Another study examined the asymmetry of hippocampal volume as well as other temporal lobe structures in 194 subjects and found similar results (52) . Functional MRI studies have revealed the presence of slight sex differences in intrinsic activity asymmetry of the human brain (21) . In our study, HCs showed no sex differences, whereas patients with AD and MCI showed significant sex differences. We consider this result to be partly influenced by the sex ratio in our sample. The male to female ratio was close to 1:1 in HCs, while females accounted for a larger proportion of the patients with MCI and AD. In both the male and female subjects, there were differences among the groups. Therefore, the lack of differences in the sum, number and mean values of the iLI among the groups may partly have been influenced by the sex ratio.\nOur study had several limitations. First, we chose MRI data from ADNI form same MRI machine with same parameter, and that is why sample size was small. Second, our study mainly focused on brain functional lateralization. Some fMRI investigations have recently suggested that functional results are potentially influenced by structural differences between groups (53, 54) because the structural pattern differences between the two hemispheres are not symmetric (27) . Unfortunately, the relationship between brain structural asymmetry and brain lateralization, which is our primary objective, has not been identified to date. Future studies that combine brain lateralization with structural asymmetry techniques will be helpful for exploring the relationship between abnormal brain lateralization and the abnormalities in brain structural asymmetry in patients with MCI and AD. Third, our study only showed a shift in the pattern of brain lateralization over the whole brain of patients with MCI and AD; we did not identify primary regions related to this type of change. We should investigate the abnormal brain lateralization in certain brain regions to precisely illustrate the complex functional deficits in patients with MCI and AD. In the future, we will mainly study aberrant brain lateralization in certain susceptible regions (e.g., the hippocampal, entorhinal, and temporal-parietal cortices) using the same method. Finally, in the current study, the global signal was used as a regressor to remove the associated variance from the fMRI analyses (49) . However, much debate exists regarding regressing the global mean signal. Further studies are needed to resolve this debate. In addition, all participants in this study were right-handed, and researchers have not determined whether the same alterations in brain lateralization occur in left-handed subjects. We may examine this issue in our future studies. In addition, because our study has a small sample size, larger samples should be investigated in the future.\nIn summary, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to quantify functional laterality based on fluctuations in intrinsic activity over the whole brain using fMRI. We observed significant brain lateralization patterns among the groups, and the alterations in brain lateralization that were different between the patients with MCI and the healthy elderly subjects were different from those observed between the patients with AD and the healthy elderly subjects. Brain lateralization was observed in the healthy elderly subjects, who exhibited a leftward predominance. In the patients with MCI, the normal leftward lateralization observed in the HCs still existed, but some abnormal right-lateralized patterns appeared. In patients with AD, the normal left lateralization pattern disappeared, and some abnormal right-lateralized patterns were observed. Our study provides new insights that may improve our understanding of the pathophysiological changes that occur during these two states of the neurodegenerative disease."}, {"section_title": "eThics sTaTeMenT", "text": "We confirm that we have read the Journal's position on issues involved in ethical publication and affirm that this work is consistent with those guidelines.\naUThOr cOnTriBUTiOns HL and LZ: manuscript drafting, revision, and editing.
