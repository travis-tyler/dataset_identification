Other aid is composed of federal veterans' education benefits, military (Department of Defense) aid, and vocational rehabilitation and job training grants. Additional details about types of aid to undergraduates are provided in appendix A. Graduate students receive grants and fellowships from the federal government; state governments; institutions; and private organizations, including their employers. Graduate students may also take out federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans and federal Direct PLUS Loans. 2 In addition, some graduate students may receive assistantships from their institutions or other sources, and some may participate in work-study. Further details about these types of aid to graduate students are provided in appendix A. One of the main factors associated with the allocation of student financial aid overall is the total price of attendance, which is the sum of tuition and fees, housing, books, and other expenses (Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008). Because average prices vary substantially by type of institution (Radwin and Wei 2015), student financial aid estimates in this report are presented by institutional control and level. 3 Results for undergraduates at public 4-year, non-doctorate-granting institutions are further subdivided by whether the institutions primarily confer subbaccalaureate awards (certificates and associate's degrees) or bachelor's degrees. Enrollment status is a second major factor related to eligibility for student aid from federal and other sources. Students who enroll full time (usually at least 12 credits for undergraduates and 9 credits for graduate students) for the full academic year (9 months or longer) generally have greater expenses and qualify for more aid than their counterparts who enroll part time or for fewer than 9 months. Consequently, this report shows student financial aid estimates for both full-time, full-year students (enrolled full time for 9 or more months) and those who enroll part time or for part of the year. A third factor associated with aid eligibility is the student's family income, which is determined by the student's dependency status. For financial aid purposes, dependent students are undergraduates under 24 years of age who are unmarried, do not have dependents, are not veterans or on active military duty, are not orphans or wards of the court, are not homeless or at risk of homelessness, and have not been deemed independent by a financial aid officer. All other undergraduates and all INTRODUCTION 3 graduate students are considered independent. For dependent students, family income consists of the parents' income. For independent students, family income consists of the student's income and, if married, the income of his or her spouse. Due to these differences in how income is defined, student financial aid estimates by income are reported separately for dependent and independent undergraduates. 4 The report is organized to present findings, beginning with selected findings from each table, followed by tables of student financial aid estimates. Following the tables, appendix A provides a glossary listing and describing all of the variables used in this report. Appendix B contains a brief technical section about NPSAS:16 and its methodology. Appendix C contains standard error tables for each of the student financial aid estimates found in the body of the report. For more information about federal student aid programs, visit https://studentaid.gov or see the 2015-2016 Federal Student Aid Handbook (U.S. Department of Education 2015). Readers are cautioned not to draw causal inferences based on the results presented in this report. Although many of the characteristics examined may be related to one another, the complex interactions and relationships among them were not explored. It should also be noted that the variables examined here are just a few of the several hundred that can be examined in the NPSAS:16 data."}, {"section_title": "Selected Findings", "text": "\u2022 Seventy-two percent of all undergraduates received some type of financial aid (table 1). Sixty-three percent received grants, 38 percent took out student loans, 5 percent received aid through work-study programs, 3 percent received federal veterans' education benefits, and 4 percent had parents who took out federal Direct PLUS Loans. \u2022 Among undergraduates who received any aid, the average total amount received was $12,300 (table 2).

Undergraduate borrowers took out an average of $6,600 in federal Direct Loans overall, $3,700 in Direct Subsidized Loans, and $4,000 in Direct Unsubsidized Loans. \u2022 Seventy-two percent of graduate students received some type of financial aid (table 7). Eight percent received graduate assistantships, 40 percent received grants, and 44 percent took out student loans. Forty percent of graduate students took out federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and 10 percent took out federal Direct PLUS Loans to graduate students. \u2022 The average total aid received by graduate students was $22,000 (table 8).

All need-based grants, merit scholarships, tuition waivers, and employer tuition reimbursements were included. Percentage estimates indicate students who received more than $0 in aid. Total student loans TOTLOAN Total amount of all student loans taken out by a student at all institutions attended during the 2015-16 academic year. This amount included all student loans received through federal, state, institutional, or private programs. A student loan was defined as a type of financial aid in which funds were advanced to a student, and the receipt of aid was evidenced by a promissory note requiring the recipient to repay the specified amounts under prescribed conditions. It excluded federal Direct PLUS Loans to parents and any loans from family or friends. Percentage estimates indicate students who received more than $0 in aid. Total work-study TOTWKST Total amount of work-study aid received by a student at all institutions attended during the 2015-16 academic year. This amount included all federal, state, and institutional work-study aid and included undergraduates who had assistantships, tutoring, dormitory, or advising jobs. Graduate research, teaching, or other assistantships were classified separately. Percentage estimates indicate students who received more than $0 in aid. It covers topics pertaining to student enrollment with a focus on how individuals and families finance postsecondary education. In addition to administering a student survey, NPSAS collects data from the institutions attended by the enrolled students and from other relevant databases, including ED records on student loan and grant programs. The result is a comprehensive dataset of studentlevel demographic and enrollment data with federal records on various forms of financial aid. Since the first NPSAS study in 1986-87, NCES has conducted NPSAS every 3 to 4 years, most recently during the 2015-16 academic year. NPSAS traditionally serves as the base-year data collection for two longitudinal studies-the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS) and the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B)-in alternating cycles. NPSAS:16 serves as the base year for B&B, which focuses on students who completed the requirements for the bachelor's degree during the 2015-16 academic year. As part of the longitudinal study, NCES contacted the B&B:16 cohort in 2017 for a follow-up survey and plans to do so again in 2020 and 2026. Consequently, subsets of questions in the NPSAS:16 student interview focused on the experience of baccalaureate recipients, including questions about the last year of their bachelor's degree program, student debt accrual and repayment status, entry to graduate school, and the transition to employment."}, {"section_title": "Data Sources", "text": "Information for NPSAS:16 came from multiple sources. \u2022 Student interview: NPSAS:16 respondents provided information through a selfadministered web survey or a computer-assisted telephone interview. \u2022 Student records: Institutions were asked to provide student information from financial aid records and other institutional sources. \u2022 Central Processing System (CPS): CPS is an ED database that consolidates data from the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) forms submitted by students. \u2022 National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS): NSLDS is an ED database containing student-level data on federal Pell Grants and federal student loans. \u2022 Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS): IPEDS is the NCES database of descriptive information about every postsecondary institution that participates in federal student financial aid programs. \u2022 ACT: These administrative records from ACT, Inc. contain survey data on students' high school courses and grades and the highest ACT admissions test score of each student between the 2009-10 and 2014-15 academic years. \u2022 SAT/College Board: These administrative records provided by College Board contain survey data on students' high school courses and grades and the students' most recent student SAT admissions test scores. \u2022 National Student Clearinghouse (NSC): These administrative records provide enrollment and completion data for institutions that participate in NSC collections. \u2022 Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA): These administrative records identify veterans and other recipients of most categories of federal veterans' education benefits, amounts of federal veterans' education benefits, and military service information."}, {"section_title": "Sample Design", "text": "NPSAS:16 used a two-stage sampling design. The first stage involved the selection of institutions. In the second stage, students were selected from within sampled institutions. To be eligible for NPSAS:16, selected institutions had to \u2022 offer an educational program designed for persons who have completed secondary education; \u2022 offer at least one academic, occupational, or vocational program of study lasting at least 3 months or 300 clock hours; \u2022 offer courses that were open to more than the employees or members of the company or group (e.g., union) that administers the institution; APPENDIX B-TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY B-3 \u2022 be located in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico; \u2022 not be a U.S. service academy institution; and \u2022 have signed the Title IV participation agreement with the Department of Education. 6 Institutions that provided only avocational, recreational, or remedial courses or only in-house courses for their own employees or members were excluded. All U.S. service academies, consisting of the U.S. Air Force Academy, the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, the U.S. Military Academy, the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, and the U.S. Naval Academy, were excluded from the NPSAS:16 institution sample because of their unique funding and tuition structure. The above institution eligibility conditions are consistent with all previous NPSAS administrations with three exceptions. First, institutions that were not eligible to distribute Title IV student financial aid were included prior to NPSAS:2000. Second, otherwise-eligible institutions that offered instruction exclusively through correspondence courses were not included prior to NPSAS:04. Third, institutions in Puerto Rico were not included in NPSAS:87 or NPSAS:12. For more information on how to compare estimates across NPSAS cycles, see \"Comparison to Prior NPSAS Administrations\" below. The NPSAS:16 target population was all eligible students enrolled at any time between July 1, 2015, and June 30, 2016, in eligible postsecondary institutions in the United States who met three additional conditions. The first condition was that students had to be enrolled in a program or coursework eligible for Title IV aid, which consisted of either (1) an academic program; (2) at least one course for credit that could be applied toward fulfilling the requirements for an academic degree; (3) exclusively noncredit remedial coursework but determined by the institution to be eligible for Title IV aid; or (4) an occupational or vocational program that required at least 3 months or 300 clock hours of instruction to receive a degree, certificate, or other type of formal award. The second condition was that students could not be currently enrolled in high school. The third condition was that students could not be solely enrolled in a high school completion program. The above student eligibility criteria are consistent with all previous NPSAS administrations except that, prior to 2012, all students enrolled exclusively in noncredit remedial coursework were ineligible to participate in NPSAS. Large systems and institutions likely to be selected with certainty (i.e., probability of selection equal to one) in the full-scale frame were removed from the field-test frame to avoid burdening them with both field-test and full-scale data collections. Likewise, field-test sample institutions were removed from the full-scale frame for the purposes of burden reduction. 7 Because some eligible institutions were excluded from being sampled, the weights for the full-scale sample institutions were adjusted so that the sum of the weights would represent the full population of eligible institutions. NPSAS statisticians selected 2,000 institutions using a variation of probability proportional to size (PPS) sampling called sequential probability minimum replacement sampling (Chromy 1979). A composite size measure (Folsom, Potter, and Williams 1987) was created using enrollment data from the most recent IPEDS 12-month and Completions components. In stage two of the sampling design, each sampled institution verified as NPSAS eligible was asked to provide a list of all students who satisfied all eligibility conditions. The NPSAS:16 student sample of 122,030 included several student subgroups that were intentionally sampled at rates differing from their actual proportion within the population to meet specific analytic objectives (e.g., to facilitate a longitudinal study of 2015-16 baccalaureate recipients, to increase the number of student veterans in the study). The oversampled student groups were \u2022 baccalaureate recipients who were veterans; APPENDIX B-TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY B-5 \u2022 baccalaureate recipients from science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs; \u2022 baccalaureate recipients from teacher education programs; \u2022 other undergraduate students who were veterans; \u2022 graduate students who were veterans; \u2022 first-time graduate students; \u2022 master's degree students in STEM programs; \u2022 doctoral-research/scholarship and doctoral-other students in STEM programs; 8 \u2022 students and baccalaureate recipients in public 4-year, non-doctorate-granting, primarily subbaccalaureate institutions; \u2022 undergraduate students at all award levels enrolled in private for-profit institutions; and \u2022 master's degree students enrolled in private for-profit institutions. Due to relatively large numbers within the target population, sampling certain student groups at a rate consistent with representation in the population would have made it difficult to draw inferences about the experiences of other bachelor's degree, master's degree, and doctoral students. For this reason, the student groups that were undersampled were \u2022 baccalaureate recipients from business programs; \u2022 master's degree students in education and business programs; and \u2022 doctoral-research/scholarship and doctoral-other students in education and business programs. Seventeen student sampling strata were identified for NPSAS:16. Like NPSAS:12, NPSAS:16 included additional stratification at the graduate-student level to improve the quality of estimates for students in STEM programs. The strata were \u2022 baccalaureate recipients who were veterans; \u2022 baccalaureate recipients from STEM programs; \u2022 baccalaureate recipients from teacher education programs; B-6 APPENDIX B-TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY \u2022 baccalaureate recipients from business programs; \u2022 baccalaureate recipients from other programs; \u2022 undergraduate students not classified as baccalaureate recipients who were veterans; \u2022 other undergraduate students; \u2022 graduate students who were veterans; \u2022 first-time graduate students; \u2022 master's degree students in STEM programs; \u2022 master's degree students in education and business programs; \u2022 master's degree students in other programs; \u2022 doctoral-research/scholarship and doctoral-other students in STEM programs; \u2022 doctoral-research/scholarship and doctoral-other students in education and business programs; \u2022 doctoral-research/scholarship and doctoral-other students in other programs; \u2022 doctoral-professional practice students; and \u2022 graduate students not enrolled in a degree program. To identify and sample veterans, Social Security numbers (SSNs) from the student enrollment lists were sent to the VBA for matching to the VBA administrative records. Students on the enrollment list who were identified as veterans receiving federal veterans' education benefits or as veterans not receiving benefits were placed in the appropriate veteran stratum. Student SSNs from enrollment lists were also matched to NSLDS financial aid data for student implicit stratification. 9 Within each student stratum, individuals were sorted by whether they received federal aid and then systematically sampled so that the number of aided and unaided sampled students approximately matched the population proportions of aided and unaided students within the institution and student strata. This implicit stratification was done to help produce more accurate financial aid estimates.

For each variable or group of variables with missing values, NPSAS staff identified imputation classes, or combinations of characteristics with no missing values, from which valid values would be selected. In the third step, an initial weighted sequential hot deck process was implemented (Cox 1980), 11 whereby missing data were replaced with valid data from donor records that matched the recipients with respect to the matching criteria. In the fourth step, a cyclic n-partition hot deck process (Marker, Judkins, and Winglee 2002) was implemented to iteratively cycle through npartition hot decks."}, {"section_title": "Weighting", "text": "All estimates in this report were weighted to represent the target population described in the Sample Design section.

The institution nonresponse and poststratification adjustments incorporate student enrollment at the institution level because all NPSAS inferences will be at the student level and not at the institution level. Additionally, the institutions were selected with PPS, with the size being counts of students, as described above. This method of sampling does not yield an accurate estimate of institutions. The student sampling weight compensates for the unequal probability of selection of students in the NPSAS:16 sample. This student sampling weight is adjusted for students attending more than one institution during the 2015-16 academic year (student multiplicity), unknown student eligibility, nonresponse, and poststratification. 10 Logical imputation is possible when a missing value can be imputed given logical or mathematical relationships between other existing variable values. For example, if a student has valid values for the total number of dependents and the number of dependent children but not the number of other dependents, the third value may be calculated as the difference of the first value minus the second value. Likewise, if a student has zero total dependents, it may be logically inferred that the student has zero dependent children. 11 The term hot deck refers to an imputation method in which valid values in the current survey dataset are used to impute missing values. In contrast, cold deck imputation replaces a missing value with a constant value from an external source such as a value from a previous survey.

As shown in table B-1, about 1,750 of the 1,990 eligible sample institutions were respondents (88 percent unweighted and 90 percent weighted). The weighted response rates, by control and level of institution, range from 74 percent for private for-profit, less-than-2-year institutions to 95 percent for public 4-year, nondoctorate-granting, primarily subbaccalaureate institutions. The institution-weighted response rate is below 85 percent for 3 of the 11 types of institutions: public less- APPENDIX B-TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY than-2-year; private for-profit, less-than-2-year; and private for-profit, 2-year institutions. A nonresponse bias analysis was conducted overall and for each institutional sector, regardless of response rate. Because all sectors were included in the nonresponse weight adjustments, the bias analysis can evaluate how well the weight adjustments reduce nonresponse bias for sectors both above and below an 85 percent institution response rate. The nonresponse bias was estimated for characteristics known for most respondents and nonrespondents. There are extensive data available from IPEDS for all institutions for the 2014-15 and 2015-16 academic years. The variables used for the nonresponse bias analysis were \u2022 control and level of institution; \u2022 2015 Carnegie Basic classification; \u2022 degree of urbanization; 12 \u2022 institution region; \u2022 Historically Black College or University status; \u2022 Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) status; 13 \u2022 percentage of full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking students receiving federal grant aid; \u2022 percentage of full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking students receiving state or local grant aid; \u2022 percentage of full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking students receiving institutional grant aid; \u2022 percentage of full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking students receiving student loan aid; \u2022 average net price among full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking students receiving grant or scholarship aid; \u2022 percentage of students enrolled who were Hispanic; \u2022 percentage of students enrolled who were Asian or Pacific Islander, non-Hispanic; 14 \u2022 percentage of students enrolled who were Black, non-Hispanic; 12 Degree of urbanization is an IPEDS variable representing the urbanicity (city/suburb/rural) by population size of the institution's location. 13 Of the listed variables, only the HSI indicator no longer exists in IPEDS.

Relative bias was computed as the ratio of the estimated bias to the weighted full-sample mean. Second, nonresponse adjustments were computed to reduce or eliminate nonresponse bias for key variables. Third, using the weights adjusted for nonresponse, the re-estimated nonresponse bias was tested for significance. These tests were complemented by effect size calculations. 16 Finally, to better understand the effect of poststratification on efforts to reduce nonresponse bias, two additional sets of estimates were created. The first set of estimates equals the differences in respondent means before and after poststratification, which corresponds to the effect of poststratification on nonresponse adjustments. The second set of estimates, equal to the difference between base-weighted full-sample means and the poststratified respondent means, corresponds to the cumulative effects of all weighting and adjustment steps. As shown in table B-4, the institution nonresponse weighting adjustment eliminated some, but not all, significant bias on the observable characteristics for sectors that met reporting requirements (excluding characteristics for sectors with fewer than five nonresponding institutions). Before weighting, the median effect size for all B-14 APPENDIX B-TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY institutions was 0.08, ranging from 0.02 for public 4-year doctorate-granting institutions to 0.27 for public 4-year, non-doctorate-granting, primarily baccalaureate institutions. The percentage of variable categories that were significantly biased was 35 percent overall, ranging from zero percent for four institutional sectors to 10 percent for private for-profit, 4-year institutions. After the nonresponse weight adjustment, the median effect size for all institutions was 0.05, ranging from 0.05 for public 4-year doctorate-granting institutions to 0.27 for public 4-year, non-doctorategranting, primarily baccalaureate institutions. The percentage of variable categories that remained significantly biased was 4 percent overall and ranged from zero percent for three institution sectors to 8 percent for private nonprofit, 4-year, doctorate-granting institutions. As shown in table B-5, the mean absolute difference between means for respondents before and after poststratification adjustment ranged from zero for public 2-year institutions to 2.6 for private for-profit, less-than-2-year institutions. Similarly, the median absolute difference between means for respondents before and after poststratification adjustment ranged from zero for public 2-year institutions to 2.2 for private for-profit, less-than-2-year institutions. (Estimates for sectors with fewer than five nonresponding institutions were excluded.) The absolute difference between means for the full sample and respondents after poststratification adjustment ranged from 0.6 for public 4-year, doctorate-granting institutions to 6.6 for public 4-year, non-doctorate-granting, primarily baccalaureate institutions; and the median absolute difference ranged from 0.5 for public 4-year, doctorate-granting institutions to 3.8 for private for-profit, 2-year institutions.

Base weights must be used in such analysis. Comparison items should have very high response rates. A full range of available items should be used for these comparisons. This approach may be limited to the extent that items available for respondents and nonrespondents may not be related to the low response rate item being analyzed\" (Seastrom 2014). Moreover, NCES Statistical Standard 1-3-5 states, \"Item response rates (RRI) are calculated as the ratio of the number of respondents for whom an in-scope response was obtained (I x for item x) to the number of respondents who are asked to answer that item. The number asked to answer an item is the number of unit-level respondents (I) minus the number of respondents with a valid skip for item x (V x ). When an abbreviated questionnaire is used to convert refusals, the eliminated questions are treated as item nonresponse. In the case of constructed variables, the numerator includes cases that have available data for the full set of items required to construct the variable, and the denominator includes all respondents eligible to respond to all items in the constructed variable\" (Seastrom 2014). The item response rate is calculated as A student was defined to be an item respondent for an analytic variable if that student had data for that variable from any source, including logical imputation. An item nonrespondent for analytic variables was a student who did not have data for that variable from any source. As shown in table B-8, the weighted item response rates for items used in this First Look report for all students ranged from 46 percent for Total aid amount (TOTAID) and Total grants (TOTGRT) to 100 percent for variables derived from IPEDS and administrative records. The weighted item response rates by control and level of institution ranged from 27 percent, for TOTAID for students in private for-profit, 2-year institutions, to 100 percent for items based on IPEDS and administrative records. Per NCES Standard 1-3-5, response rates for composite variables must account for missing inputs prior to imputation. Therefore, while many of the components of key constructed variables had response rates greater than 95 percent, some composite variables had low response rates due to components with low response rates. For example, the primary sources for the components of the composite variables for TOTGRT and Total student loans (TOTLOAN), which are the major components of APPENDIX B-TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY B-23 TOTAID, were federal databases and data obtained from institutional student records. The federal databases have complete information of federal aid; however, information on other aid that is disbursed directly to students and not through institutional financial offices is not always available. Information on Employer aid (EMPLYAMT) and Private (alternative) loans (PRIVLOAN) is sometimes obtained from student records but is generally obtained from student interview responses because institutions are not always aware of students' receipt of these aid types. If the student did not complete an interview and the institutional records for that student did not contain any employer aid or private loans for the student, these two variables were set to missing and statistically or logically imputed. The high rate of imputation for these two variables accounted for the low response rates for aggregate aid variables. STATEAMT "}, {"section_title": "APPENDIX B-TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY B-25", "text": "As shown in table B-8, 14 of the items had a weighted response rate below 85 percent, and 18 of the items had a weighted response rate below 85 percent for at least one institution type. The response rates for five items (TOTAID, TOTGRT, TOTLOAN, EMPLYAMT, and INCOMEG) were below 85 percent for all students and for all applicable institution types. (See appendix A for descriptions of these items.) A nonresponse bias analysis was conducted for the 18 items with response rates below 85 percent, summarized in table B-9 for students overall. The procedures used for the preimputation item-level nonresponse bias analysis were the same as those used for the unit-level nonresponse bias analysis presented above. Before imputation, the mean and median percent relative bias across characteristics ranged from 4.4 and 2.3, respectively, for Attendance Pattern (ATTNSTAT) to 17.6 (INCOMEG) and 8.9 (INCOMEG and TOTGRT), respectively. Median effect sizes were small, ranging from 0.03 for ATTNSTAT to 0.11 for INCOMEG. A goal of imputation (described above) is the reduction or elimination of nonresponse bias. While bias after imputation is not directly measurable, it is possible to compare estimates before and after imputation to determine whether the imputation changed the estimates. Changes generally indicate a reduction in bias, whereas no change suggests that bias was not reduced or was not present. For the preimputation versus postimputation comparisons, 12 variables showed a statistically significant difference or at least a one category-level significant difference, although most changes were small. The variables with the largest corresponding effect size and potentially the largest reduction in bias were INCOME (0.16) and INCOMEG (0.22)."}, {"section_title": "B-26", "text": "APPENDIX B-TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY "}, {"section_title": "Standard Errors", "text": "Complex sample designs, like that used for NPSAS:16, result in data that violate the assumptions that are normally required to assess the statistical significance of results. The standard errors of the estimates from complex surveys may vary from those that would be expected if the sample were a simple random sample and the observations were independent and identically distributed random variables. As a result, special procedures for estimating the statistical significance of the estimates must be employed. To facilitate computation of standard errors that reflect the complex sample design for both linear and nonlinear statistics, a vector of bootstrap replicate weights was added to the analysis file. These weights are zero for units not selected in a specific bootstrap sample; weights for other units are inflated for the bootstrap subsampling. The analytic weights for the complete sample were also included to compute the desired estimates. The vector of replicate weights allows for computing additional estimates for the sole purpose of estimating a variance. Assuming B sets of replicate weights, the variance of any estimate can be estimated by replicating the estimation procedure for each replicate and computing a simple variance of the replicate estimates; that is, \u03b8\u02c6 is the estimate based on the bth replicate weight (where b = 1 to the number of replicates) and B is the total number of sets of replicate weights (B = 200 for NPSAS:16). Once the replicate weights are provided, this estimate can be produced by most survey software packages (e.g., SUDAAN [RTI International 2012])."}, {"section_title": "B Var", "text": "The replicate weights were produced using a methodology combining approaches developed by Flyer (1987) and Kott (1988). The NPSAS application of the method incorporated the finite population correction factor at the first stage only, following the methodology proposed by Chromy (1979)."}, {"section_title": "Cautions for Analysts", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Comparison to Prior NPSAS Administrations", "text": "There have been nine NPSAS administrations covering the academic years ending in 1987,1990,1993,1996,2000,2004,2008,2012, and 2016 (NPSAS:87, NPSAS:90, B-28 APPENDIX B-TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY NPSAS:93, NPSAS:96, NPSAS:2000, NPSAS:04, NPSAS:08, NPSAS:12, and NPSAS:16, respectively). The estimates from each study can be compared to the others, but several important differences across studies limit these comparisons over time. Puerto Rico. All administrations except NPSAS:87 and NPSAS:12 sampled institutions in Puerto Rico. There are approximately 90 institutions in Puerto Rico enrolling about 1 percent each of undergraduate and graduate students nationally. In NPSAS:08, students attending institutions in Puerto Rico made up about 10 percent of Hispanic students nationally, compared with NPSAS:16, in which students attending institutions in Puerto Rico made up about 6 percent of Hispanic students nationally. Analysts who wish to compare other NPSAS administrations to NPSAS:87 or NPSAS:12 or who are interested in national estimates for Hispanic students may filter on COMPTO87 to exclude Puerto Rico. Title IV eligibility. Starting with NPSAS:2000, samples were limited to institutions participating in federal Title IV student aid programs. In the earlier surveys (NPSAS:87, NPSAS:90, NPSAS:93, and NPSAS:96), about 1 percent of undergraduate students, mainly concentrated in private for-profit, less-than-2-year institutions, attended institutions that were not eligible for Title IV aid. Analysts wishing to exclude students from institutions that were not eligible for Title IV aid may filter on T4ELIG in these earlier administrations. Community colleges. Over the past two decades, community colleges in many states began conferring bachelor's degrees in selected fields. In the IPEDS data used to determine control and level of institution in NPSAS, these institutions are categorized as public 4-year, non-doctorate-granting institutions. For NPSAS:16, this group of institutions was subdivided into two categories: (1) those that conferred mainly subbaccalaureate awards (certificates and associate's degrees) and (2) those that conferred mainly bachelor's degrees. This differs from past NPSAS administrations in which these institutions were classified together to reflect the highest level of award offered. Estimates from imputed versus unimputed data. Starting with NPSAS:04, missing values were imputed for almost all, rather than a selected subset, of variables. Analysts should use caution when comparing estimates based on imputed data with estimates based on unimputed data. Distributions of imputed and unimputed variables are not directly comparable because imputed variables have no missing values, and imputation may appreciably change the distribution of valid values for variables with a substantial proportion of missing data. Fall enrollment. Starting with NPSAS:90, all NPSAS samples have been based on 12-month enrollment, which is higher than fall enrollment commonly reported by IPEDS because those who enroll only in spring, summer, or winter terms are included in the 12-month total. This is particularly true at private for-profit, lessthan-4-year institutions, where a substantial proportion of students may enroll throughout the year and not necessarily during the fall. The NPSAS:87 sample was based on fall 1986 enrollment. Analysts wishing to compare NPSAS:87 results with those from subsequent administrations can filter on COMPTO87 in the later NPSAS administrations. Federal loans older than 10 years. In prior NPSAS administrations, federal student loans older than 10 years as of the beginning of the study were excluded from cumulative borrowing and outstanding loan amount variables. In NPSAS:16, this was changed so that loans older than 10 years were included in these variables (e.g., FEDCUM1, BORAMT1). As a result, cumulative borrowing estimates in NPSAS:16, especially for older student subpopulations, may differ from estimates for prior NPSAS administrations, with prior studies underestimating these amounts. Federal veterans' education benefits (VETBEN). In NPSAS:16, an administrative data match to VBA databases was conducted to obtain information on sampled students' receipt of federal veterans' education benefits and their military service. The VBA data was the sole source for federal veterans' education benefits amounts, and they include payments for tuition and fees, books and supplies, workstudy, housing, and other education expenses. Estimates of federal veterans' education benefits in prior NPSAS cycles were derived from self-reported amounts, amounts reported by the recipient's NPSAS institution, and stochastic imputation and were significantly lower on average than amounts in NPSAS:16. These earlier values may not include all the benefits included in the VBA data, particularly housing benefits, which were not explicitly requested from students or their institutions."}, {"section_title": "Students Attending Multiple Institutions", "text": "About 10 percent of undergraduate students and 5 percent of graduate students attended more than one institution during the 2015-16 academic year, concurrently or sequentially. These students may have attended institutions of differing types (private nonprofit, 4-year, non-doctorate-granting; private nonprofit, 4-year, doctorate-granting; and so forth) and may have had varying attendance patterns (fulltime/full-year or other) at different institutions. They are included in the calculation of total values in this report, but they are presented separately in results disaggregated by control and level of institution and excluded from results disaggregated by attendance pattern. "}, {"section_title": "Sampling Error", "text": "Because NPSAS:16 consists of a representative sample of postsecondary students rather than the entire population, the estimates in this report are subject to sampling error. A different sample of the same population, even one using identical methods, could yield different results. Similarly, estimates of aid will vary from population values reported by agency offices. The sampling error of an estimate is measured by its standard error. The standard errors for the estimates in this report were calculated with bootstrap replication procedures using PowerStats software and are available at http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2018466. Standard errors are presented in tables C-1 through C-8."}, {"section_title": "Nonsampling Error", "text": "The estimates presented in this report are also subject to various types of nonsampling error, which are variations in the estimates that may be caused by population coverage limitations as well as data collection, processing, and reporting procedures. Potential sources of nonsampling error include misreporting by survey respondents, incomplete administrative records, coding and data entry errors, misspecification of derived variables, and nonresponse. Data swapping and other forms of perturbation used to limit disclosure of information about individual study members may also lead to nonsampling error. In general, it is difficult to identify and estimate either the amount of nonsampling error or the bias caused by this error. For NPSAS:16, efforts were made to prevent such errors from occurring and to compensate for them where possible (e.g., field testing data collection instruments, using survey questions that had been tested and used in previous surveys, training interviewers, and monitoring interviewer performance and field data quality throughout the collection period)."}, {"section_title": "PowerStats", "text": "The estimates in this report were produced using PowerStats, a web-based software application that enables users to generate tables with data for most of the postsecondary surveys conducted by NCES.
