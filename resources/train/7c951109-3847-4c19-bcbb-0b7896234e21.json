Delisle and Preston Cooper", "text": "A larming stories about economic stratification at America's selective colleges are everywhere. The Jack Kent Cooke Foundation ran a headline on its website in 2017 stating, \"Report finds flagship universities becoming instruments of social stratification.\" 1 In earlier research, the Education Trust concluded that elite public universities were becoming \"engines of inequality\" because they were enrolling fewer students from low-income families. 2 A recent study by the Pell Institute for the Study of Opportunity in Higher Education \"adds to the growing body of evidence that our nation's higher education system is becoming increasingly stratified,\" according to one reporter. 3 When the New York Times covered this issue in 2017, the headline read, \"Some [private] colleges have more students from the top 1 percent than the bottom 60.\" 4 Most of these reports and articles focus on trends that the authors say contribute to declining access at selective colleges for students from low-income families. They implicitly link cuts in per-student funding for public universities, 5 increasing merit-based financial aid, 6 rising tuition prices, more competitive admissions standards, and a boost in out-of-state students to conclude that the share of students at selective schools who are from low-income families must be in decline. 7 It is logical to assume that such trends would work against low-income students' representation at America's most elite colleges. And it is easy to believe reports that find increasing economic stratification at selective universities given that the total cost of attendance has increased rapidly. Admission rates have also declined at some of these institutions, suggesting that they have grown only more competitive. But narratives surrounding low-income students' representation at selective schools often rely on incomplete evidence. Data limitations tend to restrict how comprehensively or accurately studies can assess the incomes of students enrolled at selective colleges and universities, particularly over time. 8 Even when data are available, reports and research often focus on outlier examples or a small number of institutions, such as the Ivy League. Some studies do take a comprehensive approach, however, and generally find that the share of students at selective colleges who are from low-income families has changed little since the early 2000s. We review the existing literature on the income distribution of students at selective colleges in a later section. In this report, we set out to address some of the limitations in the literature on enrollment at selective colleges and universities. We also aim to test the popular narratives, such as whether students from low-income families are in fact less represented at selective colleges than in the past; whether public flagship universities are shutting out low-income students to enroll more high-income, out-of-state students; and whether rising prices have made selective colleges less affordable for low-income students after factoring in financial aid. We use a data set that few researchers have enlisted for this type of analysis: the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS). The NPSAS is a nationally representative data set of undergraduate college students maintained by the US Department of Education. 9 An advantage of the NPSAS is that we can more directly observe the family incomes of students instead of using proxies such as whether students received Pell Grants. The NPSAS allows us to cover a long time period, the 1999-2000 to the 2015-16 academic years. We focus our analysis on the students who attended the 200 most selective public and private colleges and universities in the country by admission rates and test scores. 10 We find that, contrary to popular perceptions, the share of students at the 200 most selective colleges who are from low-income families did not decline over the period we studied. Also at odds with popular perceptions, the share of low-income students at public flagship universities has not declined since 1999-2000. This suggests that the trends that many argue have pushed low-income students out of selective colleges, such as rising prices and increases in out-of-state enrollment, have not had that effect on a national level. We also find that, after factoring in grant and scholarship aid, annual net tuition prices at selective colleges have increased by only $1,358 for lowincome students since 1999-2000, after adjusting for inflation. For high-income students, the increase was $8,162. Consistent with the popular narrative, we find evidence that the share of students who are from high-income families increased at both selective institutions and public flagship universities during the mid-2000s. However, due to data limitations, it is unclear whether these trends continued or reversed in later years. The strongest trend in the data is a decline in the share of students in the middle two income quartiles. In other words, the enrollment gains of high-income students in the mid-2000s came at the expense of middle-income students. This trend has received relatively little attention from the education community and the national media. It suggests that the narrative regarding income stratification at selective colleges is only half right. Enrollment at selective colleges has changed over time, but it is middle-income students, not low-income students, who are becoming less represented on these campuses."}, {"section_title": "Data and Methodology", "text": "To examine how the share of students enrolled at selective colleges from different income groups has evolved over time, we turn to the NPSAS. The quadrennial NPSAS gives us five snapshots of the college-going population over the past 16 years, covering the academic years 1999-2000, 2003-04, 2007-08, 2011-12, and 2015-16. Household Income. The NPSAS includes data on student incomes from one year before the stated academic year. (For example, the 2015-16 NPSAS contains 2014 income data.) For dependent students, the income of the student's parents is used. For independent students, the student's own income is used. 11 We divide students into income quartiles based on the aggregate income distribution of American households during the year in which income was measured. To be in the bottom income quartile in the 1999-2000 academic year, a student's income must be below $19,791, since that was the 25th percentile income for American households in 1998. For the 2015-16 year, the bottom income quartile ends at $25,948, and the top quartile begins at $98,810. We refer to the bottom and top quartiles as \"low income\" and \"high income,\" respectively. Income cutoffs for all years and quartiles are available in Appendix A. This definition causes the absolute income cutoffs between our groups to vary each year but allows us to gauge how the distribution of students at selective colleges reflects the country at large. If each household income quartile were perfectly represented at selective colleges, then each quartile would account for 25 percent of the students enrolled. Therefore, an income group with less than 25 percent of students at the colleges is underrepresented. 12 Selectivity Definition. We define selective colleges as the 200 most selective public and private institutions nationally. Our list of selective schools does not change. That is, the group includes the institutions that have consistently been the most selective over the time period studied. To rank schools by selectivity, we calculate the average acceptance rate and the typical SAT/ACT score of enrolled students at each institution over a 15-year period (2001-16). 13 We then create a comprehensive rank of every four-year public and private nonprofit college with sufficient data, weighting acceptance rate and typical SAT/ACT score evenly. 14 We define the top 200 schools according to this ranking as selective. These institutions enrolled just 13 percent of undergraduates nationally who meet the criteria for our analysis (discussed below). 15 The full list of schools defined as selective is available in Appendix B. For our analysis of public flagship universities, we include the one institution per state generally considered to be the flagship campus, which is not always the most selective public institution in that state. Only 12 of the public flagship institutions are also among the 200 most selective universities. A list of the 50 flagship schools is available in Appendix C. Student Subsample. We limit the sample for our analysis to students enrolled in a bachelor's degree program, thereby excluding the small number of students enrolled at selective institutions who are pursuing short-term credentials such as certificates. We also exclude all international students (but include noncitizen residents of the United States). These are the only two exclusions for the analysis. We do not restrict the sample by age or enrollment intensity (i.e., part time versus full time). We do, however, separate our results into two categories: dependent students (i.e., dependents of their parents while enrolled) and all students regardless of dependency status (i.e., including independent students). This twofold approach allows us to examine students whose parental income can be observed but also separately factor in independent students for whom parental income cannot be observed and whose own income is reported in the data. Including independent students captures the widest possible population of students enrolled in bachelor's degree programs and makes no distinctions as to whether the students are \"traditional.\" At the 200 most selective institutions in 2015-16, 16.1 percent of students were independent, which is about the same share as in 1999-2000 and 2003-04 but higher than in 2007-08 and 2011-12. 16 In 2015-16, 69 percent of students at these schools attended exclusively full time, the lowest share of any year in this analysis. 17 Strengths and Limitations of the NPSAS Data. The NPSAS includes a large sample of the 200 most selective institutions, as well as flagship institutions. It sampled between 80 and 120 of the 200 most selective institutions, depending on the year, with the largest sample of institutions taken in 2015-16. The number of students sampled at these institutions ranges from 3,520 to 6,770, depending on the year. 18 The data sets include a sample of about 40 flagship universities, with the student sample size ranging from 3,990 to 5,910. 19 More detailed information is provided in Appendix D. Because the NPSAS is a random sample of undergraduates, it does not include data for students at every higher education institution. It is, however, representative of the undergraduate population nationally and students attending broad categories of institutions, such as public four-year institutions or private nonprofit institutions. While the data set includes a variable for the institution's selectivity, it is a broad measure of selectivity. The most selective category enrolls between 20 and 23 percent of students pursuing bachelor's degrees. 20 We therefore do not use this variable and instead create our own measure of selectivity. Despite being representative of undergraduates and broad sectors of institutions-and even though it includes a selectivity variable-the NPSAS is not designed to be representative of the students attending the 200 most selective institutions or public flagship i nstitutions. A s a r esult, o ur s tudy m ay n ot be representative of the nation's 200 most selective institutions or flagship universities and should be interpreted with that limitation in mind. We do have reason to suspect that low-income students at the 200 most selective institutions may be overrepresented in the 2015-16 NPSAS. According to data in the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), 22 percent of undergraduates at the 200 most selective institutions received Pell Grants in 2015-16. 21 However, using the NPSAS we find that this share was 28 percent in 2015-16. We observe a similar phenomenon for flagship institutions. While \"Pell share\" has severe limitations as a proxy for low-income student enrollment, the discrepancy between the IPEDS and NPSAS estimates for 2015-16 suggests that lower-income students may be overrepresented in the 2015-16 NPSAS subsamples of selective and flagship institutions. For this reason, we advise interpreting our 2015-16 estimates with caution. The data on student and family incomes in the NPSAS come from administrative records for students who filed a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). That form mainly uses income information from respondents' federal tax returns. For students who did not file a FAFSA, income information is collected during an interview with the student (and the student's parents in the case of dependent students). Figure 1 shows the share of dependent students from each income group enrolled at the 200 most selective colleges from 1999-2000 to 2015-16. We do not find evidence that the share of dependent students enrolled at these institutions who are low income  declined during the 16 years covered in our study. 22 In the first year of the study, 8.1 percent of dependent students enrolled at selective colleges came from families in the lowest income quartile. That proportion holds fairly steady for the next 12 years but jumps 7 percentage points in 2015-16. 23 (Again, we advise interpreting the 2015-16 figures with caution.) The average score on college admissions tests among low-income students at these institutions did not decline during the study period, suggesting that these institutions did not lower this key admission standard to enroll more low-income students. 24 Meanwhile, the share of dependent students enrolled at these institutions who are from the top income quartile increased between 2003-04 and 2007-08. While these students made up 52.1 percent of the student body at selective colleges in 1999-2000, their share increased markedly after 2003-04 to 57.5 percent in 2007-08, and the figure is similar for 2011-12. While it appears these students' share of enrollment then declined in 2015-16, we interpret that change with caution given the likely overrepresentation of low-income students in the sample that year."}, {"section_title": "Results: Enrollment at Selective Colleges by Income", "text": "The increase in the share of dependent students at selective colleges who are high income in the mid-2000s appears to have come at the expense of students from the middle two income quartiles. Most of that change can be observed in the third income quartile. Earnings for the third quartile in 2015-16 were between $53,600 and $98,810. That group shrank from 25.2 percent of dependent students enrolled at selective colleges in 1999-2000 to 20.5 percent in 2011-12, the most of any income quartile. The change is statistically significant. The group's relative share declines even further in 2015-16 to 17.6 percent, but we interpret that result with caution given the likely overrepresentation of low-income students at selective colleges that year. Dependent and Independent Students. Figure 2 shows a similar chart but includes both dependent and independent students from each income group enrolled at the 200 most selective colleges from 1999-2000 to 2015-16. This cut of the data helps illustrate the effect of including independent students in our analysis. Some data sets and analyses exclude independent students when examining enrollment at selective universities. 25 That may be because data on these students' incomes are not readily available or because the available data reflect their own incomes, not those of their parents, which is the case for the NPSAS. Thus, the incomes of independent and dependent students are not necessarily comparable. However, we include both types of students as a second part of our analysis for a more comprehensive view of enrollment at selective institutions. Including independent students increases the estimated share of low-income students at selective colleges. More important for our analysis is that the trend is the same as it is for dependent students: Among all students, we do not find evidence that the lowest quartile's share of students enrolled at selective colleges has declined. Another findingthat middle-class students lose enrollment share to high-income students-also holds when we expand the analysis to include both dependent and independent students. The decline for the third quartile is statistically significant between 1999-2000 and 2011-12 (shown in Appendix E). 26 The declines for the two middle quartiles are statistically significant between 1999-2000 and 2015-16, but the likely overrepresentation of low-income students makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about that trend. Appendixes F-M include a number of alternative cuts of the same data, such as limiting the analysis to the 150 most selective institutions, the 250 most selective institutions, or the top two selectivity categories in the Barron's Profiles of American Colleges, as well as cuts by income quintile instead of quartile. None of these alternative cuts change our main findings. Appendixes N and O include enrollment by quartile for the population in our analysis (those enrolled in bachelor's degree programs who are US citizens or legal residents) at all institutions of higher education, providing a baseline comparison of enrollment trends. Net Price at Selective Colleges. Many assume that the share of students at selective colleges who are from low-income families should be declining because typical prices at these institutions are relatively high and have increased more than at other, less-selective institutions. NPSAS data allow us to examine this trend more closely than other data sets and by student income. The data include detailed information about both institutions' published \"sticker\" prices and the \"net\" prices that each student pays after factoring in all grants, scholarships, and discounts. 27 Figure 3 shows the median net tuition and fees paid by full-time students in each income quartile attending the 200 most selective institutions, adjusted for inflation. 28 Note that there is some uncertainty around these estimates as the sample sizes for each quartile are small, particularly in 2011-12. Appendix D shows the sample size for each quartile and year. Surprisingly, median tuition for students in the lowest income quartile has increased far less in real terms since 1999-2000 than what the popular narrative suggests. A full-time student from a low-income family pays only $1,358 more per year in tuition at a selective college today than a similar student did in 1999-2000. In relative terms, however, that is still a large increase. The finding is similar for students from the second income quartile. This evidence suggests that, despite the large increases in college prices and costs in recent decades, selective institutions and policymakers have not passed on much of the increase to low-income students by providing large increases in available student aid and tuition discounts. The lowest two income quartiles are, however, the only groups of students at selective colleges spared large tuition increases in absolute dollar terms. Students in the highest income group have borne large  That is a 64 percent increase. Students in the third income quartile-the group that saw the largest decline in enrollment at selective institutionshave also seen substantial tuition increases. Over that same time period, their net annual tuition increased by $3,433 after inflation. One important caveat to these findings is that the 200 most selective institutions include public and private institutions, which have different pricing structures. (For instance, in-state students at public universities receive heavily subsidized tuition relative to their peers at private colleges.) At both public and private institutions, net tuition for students in the top quartile has risen much faster than inflation. However, among students in the bottom three quartiles, net tuition has risen at public institutions but remained relatively flat at private ones. And public institutions have largely driven the increase in net tuition prices for the third quartile. Enrollment at Public Flagship Universities. So far we have focused on the 200 most selective public and private institutions. We also analyzed a different set of institutions that receive scrutiny for their perceived levels of economic diversity. So-called flagship universities are generally regarded as the most prestigious, largest, or most research-intensive public universities in each state. There is some debate about which university is the flagship university in certain states or whether some states have more than one. We selected the single institution in each state most commonly considered to be the flagship. (See Appendix C for the list.) Only 12 of the flagship universities are included in  the 200 most selective universities, highlighting that on a national level most flagship universities are not highly selective. Nevertheless, they often are the most selective or prestigious public institutions that students can access in their home states, and they tend to charge lower tuition to residents than private or out-of-state institutions do, making them another category of institution for gauging access to more selective colleges. Like at the 200 most selective universities, we do not find evidence that the share of dependent students enrolled at flagship universities who are low income has declined over the 16-year period studied. While the share shown in Figure 4 appears to have increased between 1999-2000 and 2015-16, from 7.5 to 12.5 percent, the likely overrepresentation of low-income students in the NPSAS sample for flagship universities in 2015-16 makes it difficult to draw that conclusion. Regarding high-income students, Figure 4 shows that they were an increasing share of the enrollment at flagship universities from 1999-2000 to 2007-08. The change is statistically significant and lines up with the finding for the 200 most selective institutions: Among dependent students, those from high-income families became even more overrepresented at these institutions during the mid-2000s.  One group, however, has become less represented at flagship universities. Like at the 200 most selective institutions, dependent students from the two middle income quartiles declined as a relative share of enrollment at flagship universities between 1999-2000 and 2011-12. Their share of enrollment continued to decline in 2015-16, but we interpret that finding with caution because low-income students are likely overrepresented at flagship institutions in the 2015-16 NPSAS. While the changes for the middle two quartiles are not statistically significant individually, when we combine the quartiles to increase the sample size, the decline is statistically significant. Thus, we find evidence that at flagship universities the group with the largest decline in relative enrollment is students from middle-income families. These findings for dependent students all hold when we include independent students in the analysis, which is shown in Figure 5. That is, our findings regarding changes to the share of students enrolled at flagship institutions from each income group move in the same direction and with similar magnitude, regardless of whether we include independent students."}, {"section_title": "Comparing Results with Other Literature on Selective College Enrollment", "text": "Readers may be interested to know how our findings compare with other studies, given the common view that low-income students have become less represented at elite colleges. In this section we discuss some of the prominent literature that examines the incomes of students enrolled at selective colleges and how the methodology, data, and conclusions from those studies differ from ours. Generally, differences arise due to how other studies define selective  universities, the groups of students that the studies exclude, or how the studies define low income. Most studies define selective universities more narrowly than we do, limiting the group to a few dozen institutions that enroll fewer than 4 percent of all undergraduates seeking bachelor's degrees. They also exclude some selective institutions that are not comprehensive universities, such as elite engineering, nursing, and art and design schools. Other differences stem from how these studies measure income. Many use proxies for income. Others exclude various subpopulations, such as older independent students or those attending part time. Some of these studies, however, reach similar conclusions to ours, finding that the share of students enrolled at selective colleges who come from low-income families has not changed substantially in the past two decades. Raj Chetty et al. By far, the most significant study on different income groups' access to selective colleges is one by Raj Chetty et al. 29 Chetty and his coauthors use restricted data from federal income tax returns to match students' college enrollments to their parents' income. They construct a data set of students born between 1980 and 1991 who attended college for at least one year between the ages of 19 and 22. Based on this data set, Chetty and his coauthors released data to the public on the income distribution of students attending thousands of colleges across America. Chetty finds that at 176 selective colleges, the share of low-income students has remained roughly constant between 1999 and 2013. 30 For students at these colleges in the 1980 birth cohort (those attending college between 1999 and 2002), roughly 5 percent came from the bottom income quintile. 31 By the 1991 birth cohort (those attending college between 2010 and 2013), the share of bottom-quintile students was 4.7 percent-a change of just half a percentage point. The picture is similar in the extreme upper tier of selectivity: In the Ivy League and other top schools, 32 bottom-quintile students accounted for 3.9 percent of both the 1980 cohort and the 1991 cohort. The authors also find that the share of students from the wealthiest quintile has increased only slightly at selective colleges. When looking specifically at the 200 schools classified as selective in our analysis, Chetty finds that the share of students enrolled at these institutions who are low income remained roughly constant over the years that overlap in our studies-the same as our finding. There is a slight discrepancy in magnitude, however, as Chetty finds that students in the bottom income quintile make up between 5.1 and 5.5 percent of enrollment at those schools. When limiting our sample from the NPSAS to dependent students only, we find that students from the bottom income quintile make up between 5.4 and 7.7 percent of enrollment at the 200 most selective institutions during the years that overlap between the two studies. 33 For all students (including independents), we find that between 11.4 and 13.2 percent of students are in the bottom income quintile during the overlapping years. Several reasons may explain the differences in the data and why we find a greater share of low-income students among the population at selective institutions, even when looking at the same set of selective institutions. First, Chetty's data exclude students who first enroll in college after the age of 22. As these students are more likely to be low income,excluding them biases the estimated low-income share downward. 34 A second reason has to do with measuring the income of students who are no longer dependent on their parents. A unique strength of Chetty's data set is that it matches independent students with their parents' income, while our data set instead uses the income of each independent student. Third, Chetty measures parents' income (for both dependent and independent students) when the student is between ages 15 and 19 and then averages it. Income in the NPSAS is recorded just once, two years before the study year (e.g., 2014 for the 2015-16 NPSAS), regardless of the student's age at the time. The Pell Grant Proxy and the Out-of-State Student Proxy. Aside from Chetty and his colleagues, several other researchers have examined the distribution of student incomes at selective colleges. Some researchers use the share of students who receive Pell Grants as a proxy for low-income student enrollment. An advantage of the \"Pell proxy\" is that it is available at the institution level, while data on student income distribution are generally available only for large groups of institutions. Jennifer Giancola and Richard Kahlenberg find that the share of students receiving Pell Grants remained constant at highly selective colleges from 2000 to 2013 but rose substantially at less-selective and nonselective schools. 35 Therefore, they conclude, even as the college-going population has shifted toward low-income students, selective colleges have not followed the trend. The Pell Institute makes a similar argument. 36 Anthony P. Carnevale and Martin Van Der Werf likewise use the Pell proxy to argue that selective colleges can and should enroll more low-income students. 37 Despite the advantages of the Pell proxy, it suffers from several drawbacks, as Jason Delisle identified. 38 First, a significant share of low-income students does not receive Pell Grants; some do not apply, and some are ineligible for various reasons. Second, many middle-class students are eligible for the grant, making the program a poor proxy for the share of low-income students enrolled in a particular university. For time-series analysis, the Pell proxy is even less reliable. Eligibility rules for Pell Grants have changed markedly over time, leading to more middle-income students using the program, and low-income students have been applying for and receiving Pell Grants at increasing rates. Therefore, an increase in the share of students receiving Pell Grants at selective universities does not necessarily reflect an increase in lowincome students. Other studies use alternative proxies for income, such as the share of out-of-state students at public flagship universities. 39 While it is commonly assumed that nearly all out-of-state students at public flagship universities are from high-income families, in fact only 56 percent of out-of-state students come from the top income quartile, and about 15 percent come from the bottom quartile. 40 These figures are similar for the public universities among the 200 most selective institutions. Other Studies. A few other studies that examine the income distribution differ from ours in important ways. Catherine Hill et al. find that the share of students at selective private colleges who come from the bottom two quintiles of the income distribution is just 11 percent. 41 This proportion did not change substantially over the 2000s. However, this study limits its analysis to just 30 private institutions based on criteria in US News & World Report rankings, while our analysis covers 200 public and private schools for a broader definition of selectivity. Another study uses the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:02) to show that just 3 percent of students attending the most selective schools were in the bottom socioeconomic status quartile. 42 While this study closely matches our cutoff for selectivity by focusing on the 193 institutions included in the top two categories of the Barron's index, its measure of income is unusual. The socioeconomic status variable in ELS:02 includes more than household income. It incorporates parents' highest levels of education and the \"prestige\" of their occupations as measures of socioeconomic status. 43 Incorporating these other variables may produce estimates of low-socioeconomic-status college enrollment that differ from estimates of enrollment focusing purely on income, as ours do."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The findings from this analysis paint a picture of access and affordability at America's most selective universities that is far less dire than many would have us believe. In fact, there is some surprisingly good news. Low-income students have not been increasingly crowded out of the most selective colleges, a finding consistent with Chetty et al. On selective college campuses, we are no less likely to find a student from the bottom income quartile today than at any time in the past 16 years. Nor are low-income students bearing the full brunt of increasing tuition and fees at these colleges and universities. State and federal aid policies, along with tuition discounts from these institutions, have kept prices for low-income students from rising as much as for other students. These findings also cast doubt on the argument that major trends in elite higher education-such as rising tuition, more competitive admissions standards, increasing merit aid, greater out-of-state student enrollment at public universities, or cuts to public higher education budgets-lead to declining relative enrollment among low-income students. Of course, findings from this analysis bolster other concerns about access to selective colleges. Students from the top quartile are vastly overrepresented at selective institutions. Moreover, the share of students on these campuses who are from high-income families increased markedly in the mid-2000s. And despite the good news that the share of low-income students at selective institutions has not declined, it is concerning that the share of students from middle-income families has gone down. That income group saw the steadiest and most pronounced changes in enrollment at selective institutions, with their relative numbers declining substantially. The causes of those changes are beyond the scope of this report but clearly merit further study. The middle class may be far more susceptible to the trends and practices that observers worried would shut low-income students out of selective colleges. It may also be that these students are caught between two competing goals and pressures that selective universities face in their enrollment practices. Enrolling low-income students requires that the universities make generous aid and discounts available to these students; the institutions must therefore continue to enroll large numbers of high-income students who pay the highest tuition prices, which helps finance the aid and discounts for low-income students. Middle-income students fall into neither category, which could be why their ranks are thinning at selective colleges and universities."}, {"section_title": "About the Authors", "text": "Jason D.
