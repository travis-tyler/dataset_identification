Problem solving is one of the skills that must be mastered by an individual. Van De Wall (1994) defined problem as difficult question, debate, and thought; while Andrews (1992) viewed problem as a mind training question through simplifying puzzles and difficult situations. However, Mathematical problem refers to a new situation faced by a person, who has no ready solution to it; he tries to find suitable solution to it inside him (Vanloggerenberg, 2002) . On the other hand, Clement and Sarama (2000) defined mathematical problem as a process of thinking and searching for patterns and relations. (NCTM, 2000) has emphasized on problem solving standard through building new knowledge, using, adapting several strategies for problem solving and emphasizing on meditation in its solving procedures. International Contests of Mathematics and Science also emphasized on problem solving through their presented questions (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study; TIMSS, 2003) . This led to the adoption of this technique in Jordanian Ministry of Education. The directions within the knowledge based economy as well as the adoption of realistic appraisal emphasized a number of skills such as; critical thinking, reflective thinking and self-review. The most important of the skills was mathematical problem solving, as suggested in Annual Report on National Test for Controlling Teaching Quality (2005) .\nSeveral studies have also addressed mathematical problem topic, which investigated the construction of attitudes scales towards it, on one hand (Alzoubi, 2014; Ibrahim, 2001) , and the methods and strategies that promote the ability to solve mathematical problem, while linking them to other variables such as achievement, thinking, and attitudes, on the other hand (Shdooh, 2006; Hamshari, 2005) . Therefore, problem solving is one of the basic skills that can be measured and enhanced by several methods and techniques as well as the basic core in mathematics teaching and learning.\nThe result of rapid changes in information technologies and technological revolution in mathematics teaching and methods are represented by modern teaching methods beginning with the scientific calculator, through video teaching topes, and some other electronic equipment to the computer, and multimedia and programs. A development was observed in this domain leading to better achievement in teaching of mathematics compared to classical methods that rely on the blackboard and other explanatory instruments. However, what is important here is not the comparison between modern and classical methods, but in using the most suitable modern methods for the subject, place and educational environment (Bashiti, 2007; Yushau and Wessels, 2003) .\nIt is also important to note that, mathematics plays crucial role among teaching approaches in educational process and practice, as it is the language of science. Many countries worked on developing mathematical education as well as the introduction of adaptations or making some reforms in making it easy for other countries; meanwhile, some researchers and teachers have conducted some researches and experiments on using technology in improving math teaching, and showing positive attitudes among teachers (International Conference in Mathematics Education, 2000) .\nAccording to Breckler and Wiggins (1992) , attitude is a state of mental and neural preparation and alertness organized by experience, and directed by individuals responses to various stimuli, while Osgood (1991) defined attitude as a general tendency to respond towards certain subject, situation, or general acquired tendency that directs behavior. Furthermore, Eagly and Chaiken (1995) define attitudes as a harmonic organization of concepts, habits, beliefs and motives for a specific thing which leads the holder to respond favorably. Reasons for these different definitions of attitude are the formative nature of the attitude and its lettuce nature, but can be inferred through people's behavior or from connectedness and consistency types among people's responses to stimuli resulting from the attitudinal subject (English and English, 1985; Woo, 2005) .\nAn individual acquires his values, ideals and attitudes from his society, through the interaction between him and his society, and it is important that society reinforces positive attitude among individuals given that attitudes are learned but not innate (Gibson, 2003) . Meanwhile attitudes can be changed but under certain conditions, but the change process is not as simple as we expect, for it is difficult to change attitudes learned by childhood as well as attitudes related to beliefs, basic needs and motives (Hsiao, 2003; Tantekin, 2002) .\nIt was also found that attitudes nature might enable us to predict the degree to which technology is accepted. Anderson (1997) pointed out that teaching via technology can be increased when teachers' attitudes towards it became positive, in the same time. Selwyn (1997) emphasized that the success of technological media in any educational area depends on the attitudes of both teachers and students. Therefore, mathematics teaching and learning is centered on a new application that will help students in their scientific achievement, solve mathematical problems after having its photographed via the mobile phone depending on intelligent phones characteristics (Mustafa, 2014) .\nAccording to Owano (2014) , Photo Math, from the software development company Micro Blink, will make the student's phone do math homework. Just point the camera towards the mathematical expression, and Photo Math displays a result. The Photo Math solves equations using the camera on an iOS or Windows phone and will be available for Android early next year. More important, Photo Math is not just a camera-based calculator. Its value is not just in giving the phone user the answer but in being able to display the solution in steps taken to solve the problem. The user can understand the process that was used to solve the problem (Figure 1 ).\nThis application is capable of solving algorithms, fractions, exponential roots and linear equations, but it does not solve derivation or integration problems; though they are expected in the future. This application provides a step by step solution to mathematical problem, and is expected students will like it because it might help them to cheat during exams. On the other hand teachers are afraid that this application will minimize students' ability to think and solve mathematical problems This might lead the student to abandon mathematical teachers' role in teaching and directing mathematical problems solving methods (Electronic AlFajer, 2014) . Robinson and David (1996) also pointed out that mathematical teaching methods should respond favorably to development requirements and take off its classical thought. The authors added that, students are in need of modern techniques for mathematical learning that brings beneficial way of learning in the face of future challenges and emphasized the necessity of motivating teachers to adopt, and introduce technology in their classrooms Howe et al. (1991) emphasized that changes that occurred in the last quarter of the 20 th century led to modifying its learning approaches in accordance with the nature of this age challenges. This has led several researchers to increase their concern in investigating math magical teaching methods to find the most efficient way in gaining a more meaningful and long lasting one.\nDue to lack of local studies on math teacher's attitudes towards photo math in solving math problems using mobile camera, the researchers review studies related to attitudes towards math teaching and learning using modern technology such as computers and internet, in general, and those related to mathematical problem solving in particular; to benefit from their procedures and instruments building and arranged from oldest to newest. Khatib (1994) 's study on teachers attitudes towards teaching technology and its relationship with some variables in Irbid governorate revealed that, teachers have positive attitudes towards teaching technology; and there are no statistically significant differences in teachers' attitudes due to their sex, majors, years of teaching, exposure to teaching technology courses, or the stage they teach.\nTeeter (1997)'s study about internet experience in teaching a course of education at Arkansas Little Rock University showed that this experience had negative attitudes of teachers towards the teaching profession, but there are some positive benefits including increased students' motivation and enthusiasm to participate in discussions and looking for sources via the internet and the possibility to access unlimited sources related to the subject.\nCharp (2000) did UNESCO studies from different countries, regarding internet role in education; the findings showed that technology had positive effects on students' motivation towards teaching and increased their self-learning, improving their communication and writing skills. It also has a positive effect on teachers' attitudes towards teaching where it helped them on diversification of their teaching approaches, increased their professional development and knowledge of their specialization, helped them in finding managerial solutions in their classes and enhance belonging and connectedness between teachers and students and finally it helped teachers in identifying various individual skills and characteristics of their students.\nSimilarly, Muhaisen (2000) conducted a study on education colleges' faculty members in Saudi Universities. The results showed a shortage in computerized services for faculty members and a poor use of computer accompanied with high negative attitudes among faculty members towards computer use. It was also found that lack of training of these faulty members and the absence of computer's technicians are among the most serious obstacles in their use of computers.\nFinally, Haqh (2003) studies the extent of multi-media effectiveness on community colleges students towards computerized instruction. Results indicate that students have positive attitudes towards computerized instruction. In support, Isaac (2012) asserts that there is a high positive attitude of teachers towards using computers in teaching mathematics.\nDespite the benefit drawn by the researchers from previous studies regarding current study procedures, on attitudes towards mathematics teaching and learning in general, which was almost negative, but the researchers could not find any study addressing math teachers' attitudes towards photo math application. The study therefore sought to find out factors influencing mathematics teachers' attitudes towards photo math in solving mathematical problem using the mobile camera in Directorate of Education District of BaniKinana in IrbidJordan."}, {"section_title": "Research questions", "text": "The study sought to answer the following research questions:\ni. What are the factors influencing mathematics teachers' attitudes towards photo math application in solving mathematical problems using mobile camera? ii.

The findings of the study will form a basis on which academic researchers can do further studies on photo math in the country. The results of this study might provide decision makers and those interested in mathematical teaching methods with empirical findings which will enable them make policy recommendations towards photo math in the country. The study will also bridge the gap and variance between those who supported or opposed using photo math application."}, {"section_title": "Limitations of the research", "text": "The study was confined to a sample of male and female math teachers at Directorate of Education District of BaniKinana in Irbid-Jordan for the school year 2014/2015. Also, the study instrument was limited to attitudes towards photo math application scale; therefore the generalization of its results will be dependent on its validity and reliability indications."}, {"section_title": "METHODOLOGY Participants", "text": "The study population consisted of all (129) male and female mathematics teachers at Directorate of Education District of BaniKinana in Irbid-Jordan, distributors on 106 schools (38 schools for males, 32 schools for females, and 36 schools for both males and females).The study used judgmental/purposive sampling method which enabled the researchers to choose (127) male and female teachers from Directorate of Education District of BaniKinana in Irbid-Jordan, during the first semester for the school year 2014/ 2015. Only two males were exempted from the sample; because of their absence from work (Unpublished statistical issued from Directorate of Education District of Banikinanah)."}, {"section_title": "Instrument", "text": "Depending on previous literature and studies related to attitudes in general, a questionnaire was used to measure math teachers' attitudes toward photo math in solving mathematical problems using mobile camera, in general and attitudes towards mathematical problem in particular. The researchers benefited from previous literature and modern studies on this subject. The researchers reviewed published articles on different electronic sites related to photo math application, and in light of the above, attitudes scale (questionnaire) of 32 items to measure attitude towards photo math was formulated. Face validity of the instrument was assured by reviewing it by a group of experienced and efficient referees in various specialties (Measurement and Evaluation, Educational Psychology, Teaching Methods) and were asked to give their opinions in its items in terms of items clarity and language correctness, and items suitability in measuring the study purpose; and after this process (5) items were deleted.\nThe questionnaire consisted of 27 items in the final form, according to Likert scale (I agree, I agree to some extent, I do not agree). Some items were positive for each given number (3, 2,1), respectively, and other negative items gave the same numbers; but in reverse, the formulation of all items for future language was also taken into account.\nThe instrument was administered on a sample of (15) teachers from outside the study sample. It was applied twice within an interval of 10 days. Reliability was estimated by using Test-retest method. Total reliability coefficient of the instrument was (0.86) which is considered acceptable for the purpose of the study."}, {"section_title": "Procedures", "text": "Mathematics teachers at Directorate of Education District of BaniKinana in Irbid in the first semester for the school year 2014/ 2015 were determined, and a meeting was held with them to explain the idea of photo math application in solving mathematics problems.

I feel that photo math application will cause my students to be less respectful in the class.\n1.91 0.79 Total Scale 2.52 0.32 photo math application in solving mathematical problem using mobile camera. Means and standard deviations of teachers' responses are calculated in Table 1 . Table 1 shows that total means score of teachers' attitudes was (2.52); Standard Deviation, 0.32, which is equal to 81.48% of the instrument as a whole. This suggests that factors influencing mathematics teachers' attitude toward photo math were high and positive. To identify the degree of appreciation, the researchers used the following appreciation: (1-1.66: Low; 1.67-2.33: Mid.; 2.34-3: high and positive)]. Item No. 14 was first in the highest mean account (2.86); whereas item No. 27 was last in mean account (1.91). This might be due to the fact that teachers are feeling the need for such application to facilitate their role in problem solving, and becoming a guide to the solution, seeking and encouraging new technological development in order to teach mathematics better than classical methods that depend on chalkboard. This finding is inconsistent with Electronic AlFajer (2014).\nThe author reported that teachers are afraid of using this application. On the other hand, this study is in agreement with the results obtained by Robinson and David (1998); Howe et al. (1991) . This authors emphasized the motivation of teachers to adopt the technology and introduce it in their classroom. Do Mathematics teachers' attitudes toward photo math application in solving math problem using the mobile camera differ according to the stage a teacher teaches?\nIn answering this question, t-test was used, and results are displayed in Table 2. Table 2 shows no statistically significant differences due to the stage a teacher teaches and this might be due to mathematical teachers' perceptions that photo math application is necessary for all students either in the basic or in the secondary stage, In answering this question, t -test was used. Table 3 shows its results. Table 3 shows statistically significant differences in teacher's attitudes towards photo math due to the educational qualification. These differences are in favor of those holding diploma and higher degrees. This might be due to the fact that higher degrees holders have more vision and culture regarding technology, so they perceive the importance of motivating teachers a caption of technology and its introduction to their classroom. This finding rhythms well with Robinson and David (1998) who state that higher degrees holders have more vision and culture regarding technology. They also pointed out those mathematical teaching methods should respond favorably to development requirements and take off its classical thought.\nDo Mathematics teachers' attitude towards photo math application in solving mathematical problem using mobile camera differ according to their teaching experience?\nTo answer this question, means, standard deviation were computed as shown in Table 4 . The table shows apparent differences between means. To find out difference significance, 1-way ANOVA was performed and results are shown in Table 5 . Table 5 shows no statistically significant differences in teachers' attitudes due to their years of experience. This might be due to the importance attached on students' need for technological application in the teaching process by all teachers. Therefore no significant differences were observed between the variables. This finding is consistent with Charp (2000) 's results which showed that technology had positive effect on teachers' attitudes towards teaching; it helped them to diversify their teaching approaches, increase their professional development and knowledge of their specialization, helped them in finding managerial solutions in their classes."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "What can be deduced from the results of the current study, in general, is as follows:\n1.
