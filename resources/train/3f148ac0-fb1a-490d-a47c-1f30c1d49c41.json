Risky fallers were significantly higher functioning than normal fallers. Conclusions: Persons who fell while engaging in normal activities exhibited lower PA overall and throughout most of the day, and were of lower functional status than persons who fell while engaging in risky or unusual activities, suggesting that engagement in risky or unusual PA is associated with higher functional ability and lower falls risk in older persons."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "F alls are estimated to be the leading cause of both fatal and nonfatal unintentional injuries in older adults. 1 Annually, falls are responsible for over $30 billion in health care spending in the United States. 2 Approximately 30%-40% of communitydwelling older adults aged 65 yrs and older experience a fall annually, and half of these falls result in some form of injury leading to declining physical function, loss of independence, illness, or even death. 3 To this end, fallers generally report reduced quality of life up to 9 mos or more after a fall. 4 Physical activity (PA) has been shown to be an important modifiable risk factor in the prevention of falls. There is an abundance of both observational and experimental evidence demonstrating that older adults with a history of falls are less active than nonfallers, and that increasing PA may result in fall reduction. [5] [6] [7] [8] However, until recently, most of these studies have measured PA subjectively with easily administered questionnaires. 9 These measures are generally considered inexpensive and valid, but introduce issues like recall bias and social desirability effects. 10 Moreover, their validity in older populations is likely lower, given that most older adults spend only 6-10 mins per day in moderate or higher PA, with the rest of daily PA coming from low-intensity activities related to daily living that are difficult to conceptualize and categorize as \"physical activity.\" [11] [12] [13] In addition, older adults are more prone to recall bias than younger populations because of a greater risk of cognitive challenges leading to the potential for differential measurement error. 12 Accelerometers offer an objective alternative to questionnaires for measuring daily PA, which minimizes the aforementioned biases. These devices allow measurement of total daily movement, and include low-intensity activities related to daily living that are generally overlooked when using questionnaires. 13 From Institute on Aging.

Jennifer Schrack was responsible for data acquisition and also worked on the study design, analysis, interpretation of data, and preparation of manuscript. Furthermore, objectively measured PA can help discern subtle differences in daily quantities and patterns of PA that may be important to health and functional status with aging.\nTo date, the association between objectively measured PA and falls has been underaddressed, apart from a few studies that show a significant inverse association between PA and falls in older adults. 14, 15 Moreover, this work has concentrated on total amount of daily PA, which leaves daily patterns of PA in fallers and nonfallers unaddressed. Identifying critical differences in the quantities, patterns, and trends of daily PA in fallers and nonfallers could deepen our understanding of the relationship between falls and PA, thus providing a more accurate understanding of the falls-PA relationship, and leading to more comprehensive interventions.\nGiven the many dire consequences of falls, identifying behaviors and patterns of behavior predictive of falls is important for reducing risk of falls, and preserving mobility and independence into late life. To this end, this study aimed to examine diurnal patterns of PA in a well-functioning group of older adults by falls history and corresponding characteristics using objectively measured PA data collected in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA)."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "The BLSA is a study of normative human aging, established in 1958 and conducted in Baltimore, MD by the National Institute on Aging Intramural Research Program.

After enrollment, participants are followed for life, attending follow-up visits and in-depth testing every 1-4 yrs depending on participant age. The BLSA began collecting objectively measured PA data in 2007. The population for the current study consists of 840 men and women participating in the BLSA between 2007 and 2014 who wore an activity monitor and completed an inperson health interview with a falls questionnaire.

Height and weight were measured according to standard protocols. A trained and certified interviewer and nurse practitioner respectively collected participant social demographic, health practices, and general symptom information including falls history and conducted an extensive health history interview and physical examination.\nFall status was assessed with the question, \"In the past 12 months, have you fallen and landed on the ground or floor?\" This was followed-up with questions detailing: (1) how many times the participant fell during the past year, (2) whether or not an injury was sustained, and (3) what type of activity was being performed during the fall (normal/usual or unusual/risky). Specifically, interview responses were categorized as follows:\n\u2022 \"Fallers\" were those who reported falling and landing on the ground or the floor during the previous 12 mos \u2022 \"Single fallers\" were those who reported falling once during the previous 12 mos \u2022 \"Multiple fallers\" were those who reported falling 2 or more times during the previous 12 mos \u2022 \"Normal fallers\" were those who reported falling during normal/usual activities \u2022 \"Risky fallers\" were those who reported falling during perceived unusual or risky activities (e.g., riding a bike, hiking, yard work, or major housework)\nParticipant functional status was assessed during the interview with standard questions asking about difficulty performing daily tasks. Specifically, whether or not a participant had difficulty walking 1 mile, raising their arms, or standing up from a chair without using their arms for support. Participants with \"balance problems\" were those who self reported any level of difficulty keeping their balance while walking on a level surface during their participant interview.\nPhysical activity was assessed using the Actiheart (Actiheart, CamNtech, Ltd, Papworth, UK) combined heart rate and activity monitor. On the last day of their clinic visit, participants were fitted with the device and asked to continue wearing it at all times for the following 7 days except when bathing or swimming. The device was placed horizontally on the chest at the third intercostal space with two standard electrocardiogram electrodes, a valid and reliable placement for measuring free-living PA. 17, 18 Heart rate and activity counts were measured in 1-min epochs for up to 7 days, after which time the monitors were returned by express mail. Activity data were downloaded via commercial software (Actiheart, version 4.0.32) into 1-min count epochs. Days with more than 5% of data missing (more than 72 mins per day) were excluded from the analysis. For the remaining days, missing values were imputed with the average over all of the days at the same period during the same visit. 19 "}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "Because of the positively skewed distribution of daily total activity counts, the natural logarithm of each activity count was taken at the minute level. The daily total was then calculated using these log-transformed values, which produced a normal distribution of daily log-transformed activity counts appropriate for linear regression analysis. Although logarithmic values may be less clinically interpretable, the conclusions are the same regarding whether differences in PA exist between groups.\nMultiple linear regression was used to assess the continuous association between the daily total log-transformed activity counts and falls adjusting for age, sex, education, employment, cardiovascular, neurological, lung, and kidney disease as well as arthritis, cancer, diabetes, stroke, and hypertension. Subsequent models included covariates for each fall category independently. Based on findings in previous work, interactions by age were also assessed in all models.\n14 To explore differences in diurnal patterns of PA by fall category, total log-transformed activity counts were calculated and modeled in six 4-hr time bins (12:00 a.m. (Figs. 1A-D) . Based on the appearance of these plots, the association between the total log-transformed activity counts of each time bin and falls was modeled using linear regression, adjusting for age, sex, and body mass index. Differences in functional status were assessed by participant self-reported ability to perform daily tasks. Differences in responses for each question were tested using \u03c7 2 tests. Collinearity was examined in all models using the variance inflation factor. All variance inflation factors were under 3, indicating the presence of little collinearity. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the effects of limiting the analysis to those \u226550 and \u226565 years.

Previous work has reported that the relationship between PA and falls is typically modified by age, and that in younger adults higher PA tends to be associated with more falls, whereas in older adults, greater PA tends to be associated with fewer falls.\n14 This is likely because of fundamental differences in daily quantities, patterns, and trends of PA between younger, healthier individuals and older, less-functionally intact persons. Previous research has supported the dose-response association between PA and falls with aging, but has not examined differences in PA by time of day, relying on daily summary measures that may not accurately reflect differences in daily PA by falling status. The current results expand upon the PA and falls literature by characterizing daily PA quantities, patterns, and trends among several important groups of older adults of varying functional statuses from which unique daily insights can be gleaned and falls-reduction interventions can be tailored to preserve mobility and independence into late life.\nIndividuals with reported balance difficulties exhibited significantly lower PA beginning in the afternoon into the night and were more likely to report a history of cardiovascular disease, stroke, neurological problems, diabetes, cancer, and lower extremity arthritis, demonstrating the complexity of the associations among poor balance, chronic conditions, daily PA, and risk of falls. Risky fallers had significantly higher PA compared to normal fallers throughout most of the day, beginning in the morning (8:00 a.m.) and lasting until night (7:59 p.m.), with the greatest differences present in the morning and afternoon. Multiple fallers had higher peaks of daily PA, overall, compared with single fallers and interestingly risky fallers were more likely to be multiple fallers than normal fallers. This consistently lower PA among normal fallers may be indicative of greater functional challenges with activities related to daily living or more difficulty managing chronic conditions as well as a greater propensity for fatigue, which may further contribute to the onset and progression of sedentary behaviors with aging. 21 Taken together, the current findings suggest that older adults with greater disease burden and poorer functional status may be more easily fatigued or experience a greater fear of falling compared with their healthier, more functional counterparts. [22] [23] [24] The often substantial differences in PA between groups of varying functional statuses, especially around midday, support the hypothesis that these time-of-day differences can be quite informative regarding health and functioning in older adults. Though cross-sectional, these findings highlight time-of-day differences that may be helpful in designing interventions to reduce falls by targeting PA increases for times where PA is typically lower. Given the established success of PA interventions in older populations, these targeted interventions could potentially enhance and add to the ability to increase mobility and quality of life. [5] [6] [7] [8] In addition, identifying time of day differences in PA by functional status will allow more focused efforts and directed clinical discussions with patients to overcome the obstacles potentially contributing to lower PA during these times. This study has several limitations. First, participants in the BLSA are healthier than the general population. This may attenuate the differences in PA between fallers and nonfallers, resulting in an underestimation of the true relationships among comorbidities, employment, and PA with aging. To account for the high-functioning level of participants, the current analysis compared activity levels of those that fell doing risky or unusual activities with those that fell doing normal routine activities. These two groups represent two very different types of individuals as demonstrated by the significantly higher PA, better balance, and lower prevalence of reported functional challenges in the risky fallers compared with the normal fallers. Those that are able to engage in activities they perceive to be risky are likely functionally superior to those who fall doing normal activities like getting out of bed or into the shower. Thus, by comparing differences in PA in these two groups, it is possible to examine how highly functioning individuals differ by total daily PA as well as PA throughout the day, compared with lessfunctional individuals more prone to falling during routine tasks, highlighting differences that are important for sustaining PA and function later into life. Second, the measurement of falls with a health interview questionnaire is subject to substantial recall bias. Importantly, those who remember their falls are more likely to have sustained injuries, and less-intense falls may not be reported. Finally, the cross-sectional design of this analysis prevents causal inference and direction of associations from being determined.\nThe health benefits of PA are well established, but a more comprehensive understanding of the benefit of the overall amount of time spent ambulatory, as well as the diurnal patterns of daily PA will aid in the establishment of improved recommendations, interventions for maintaining daily PA into late life, and focused clinician-assisted interventions to overcome specific patient obstacles responsible for these time-specific differences. The current findings use such metrics to add to the substantial literature on PA and falls by highlighting fundamental differences in objectively measured total and time of day PA in a well-functioning population of older adults. Future longitudinal research on the directionality of the associations presented in these analyses, as well as interventions to improve daily nadirs of activity is warranted. The mean log-transformed activity counts for fallers was 0.3 log-counts higher than nonfallers, with similar interpretation for other bins. The mean activity counts for multiple fallers was 9.6 log-counts lower than single fallers. The mean activity counts for risky fallers was 6.2 log-counts higher than normal fallers."}]
