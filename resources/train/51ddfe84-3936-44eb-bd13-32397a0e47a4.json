[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Aging is accompanied by increasing vulnerability to pathologies such as atherosclerosis (ATH) and Alzheimer disease (AD). Are these different pathologies, or different presentations with a similar underlying pathoetiology? Discussion: Both ATH and AD involve inflammation, macrophage infiltration, and occlusion of the vasculature. Allelic variants in common genes including APOE predispose to both diseases. In both there is strong evidence of disease association with viral and bacterial pathogens including herpes simplex and Chlamydophila. Furthermore, ablation of components of the immune system (or of bone marrow-derived macrophages alone) in animal models restricts disease development in both cases, arguing that both are accentuated by inflammatory/immune pathways. We discuss that amyloid \u03b2, a distinguishing feature of AD, also plays a key role in ATH. Several drugs, at least in mouse models, are effective in preventing the development of both ATH and AD. Given similar age-dependence, genetic underpinnings, involvement of the vasculature, association with infection, A\u03b2 involvement, the central role of macrophages, and drug overlap, we conclude that the two conditions reflect different manifestations of a common pathoetiology."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Better nutrition and lifestyle changes make important contributions to extending human lifespan, but new morbidities are encountered with aging, notably AD and ATH. At first sight these appear to be different conditions. In the present debate we address whether the two conditions are different, or instead share a common etiology. We build upon a previous debate -Ill or Just Old? -and agree with Izaks and Westendorp that 'we should investigate the risk factors (component causes) of diseases in the latter part of life' [1] . The discussion here commences with age-related risk factors, genetic predispositions, animal models, and the central involvement of the vasculature and inflammation. We then extend the discussion to infection, amyloid \u03b2, animal models, infection, drugs, and the central signaling role of cholesterol derivatives. We suggest that both conditions result from an inflammatory disorder as a result of an infectious condition, both crucially linked to sterol metabolism and innate immunity, leading to vascular occlusion."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Disease characteristics", "text": "AD is the main form of dementia (~70%) in Western countries, and is characterized by the presence in postmortem brain of extracellular amyloid plaques composed of ' A\u03b2' generated by the aggregation of toxic peptide fragments of the Alzheimer precursor protein, APP, and intraneuronal deposition of highly phosphorylated filamentous aggregates (neurofibrillary tangles, NFT) of the microtubule-associated protein Tau. Onset is typically above age 70 ( Figure 1 ).\nBy contrast, ATH (from Greek athera, 'gruel': gruellike deposits, and sclerosis, 'hardening'), also known as arteriosclerotic vascular disease, is not a unitary disorder, and instead ranges from primary arterial atheroma -inflammation and accumulation of cholesterol-laden macrophages in the walls of major arteries -to 'plaque' formation and inflammation in the arterial wall [6] , leading to progressive occlusion, with consequent risk of myocardial infarction or cerebral stroke because plaque rupture can provoke thrombosis. Disease development is accompanied by disruption of the endothelial cell layer, vascular smooth muscle cell migration, and matrix calcification. Onset is a little earlier than for AD, but ultimately affects a similar proportion of the elderly (Figure 1 ).\nThe ongoing rise in both AD and ATH has been ascribed, rightly or wrongly, to the increasing adoption of a Western sedentary lifestyle accompanied by a diet rich in fats and sugars. Both disorders are essentially unknown in children and young adults, with onset in later life ( Figure 1 )."}, {"section_title": "Vascular involvement", "text": "At first glance the two diseases would appear to be distinct, with ATH being characterized by cholesterol-rich deposits in arterial walls and AD by neuronal loss, NFT, and amyloid plaque formation. However, there is increasing evidence that AD is also associated with vascular dysfunction. Although the structure of cerebral arteries and arterioles differs somewhat from that of the major blood vessels, they are similarly dependent on endothelial and smooth muscle cells [7] .\nStudies in AD mouse models have confirmed that disease development is associated with deposits in the cerebral arterial vasculature [8] . In patients, extracellular deposits of amyloid in AD brain are principally associated with the cerebral arterial vasculature, and deposit density declines with distance from the larger vessels [9, 10] . It has been postulated that dysfunction of vascular endothelial cells lining brain blood vessels plays a central role in precipitating neuronal death [11] .\nBrain scanning revealed that AD is associated with decreased cerebral blood flow [12, 13] , as also seen in AD mouse models [14] . Roher [15] examined cerebral arteries from confirmed AD cases and age-matched non-demented controls. In addition to plaques and tangles, it was found that AD cases displayed a degree of cerebral artery (circle of Willis) occlusion that was significantly greater than in controls (Figure 2) , and there was a positive correlation between the degree of arterial stenosis and NFT score [15] . This finding was confirmed in a study by Hofman et al. who examined AD patients and controls for markers of atherosclerosis including vessel wall thickness as assessed by ultrasonography. All markers of ATH were over-represented in AD patients versus controls, and the odds ratio for AD in those with significant ATH versus those without was 3.0 (CI 1.5-6) [16] . Since then the lead findings have been widely confirmed [17] [18] [19] ; the link between intracranial atherosclerosis and AD is not an artifact of diagnostic misclassification [20] .\nThe recent Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) found that individuals with (non-brain) coronary or aortic ATH per se are not at increased risk of AD. However, intracranial atherosclerosis was confirmed as a strong risk factor for dementia [21] .\nIt remains possible that AD might encompass two distinct conditions: a major class with involvement of the cerebral vasculature, and a minor class in which no such involvement is apparent. However, this is unclear. Ellis et al. provide evidence that the major class of AD (83%) is associated with brain angiopathy [22] . The second most common classification (15%) of senile dementia, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA/vascular dementia), is primarily associated with amyloid-positive lesions of the cerebral vasculature, and has substantial overlaps Figure 1 Age-dependence of Alzheimer disease and atherosclerotic vascular disease. Compiled from multiple sources including [2] [3] [4] [5] .\nwith both ATH and AD [23, 24] . Further studies are needed on the subclassification of AD-related senile dementias according to type of vascular involvement. However, the combined evidence demonstrates that the large majority of clinically diagnosed AD cases display significant vascular involvement.\nIn sum, the major forms of both AD and ATH are associated with vascular wall thickening and blood vessel occlusion. The predominant localizations differ (major arteries in ATH, cerebral arterial vasculature in AD); the pathways leading to disease may also differ. In ATH, vascular deposits impair heart function and are at significant risk of entering the circulation, leading to stroke. In AD, brain hypoperfusion has been causally associated with disease [25] . We surmise that thickening of the cerebrovasculature leads to impaired O 2 and nutrient delivery to the brain, predisposing to neuronal loss ( Figure 3 ). These pathways are not necessarily independent: ATH alone might compromise cerebral O 2 /nutrient supply and, conversely, AD-like processes in crucial brain regions could deregulate the cardiovascular system.\nOverall, the evidence suggests that AD and ATH represent a spectrum of related conditions, with vascular involvement as a common predisposing factor, although the site of vascular involvement differs between the two diseases. We next dwell on the different genetic risk factors and how they cast light on the relationship between AD and ATH."}, {"section_title": "Genetic predisposition Polymorphic loci associated with both diseases", "text": "If there is an overlap between AD and ATH it would be expected that risk alleles would be shared between the two diseases. Hyperlipidemia is a risk factor for both diseases, and mutations leading to hyperlipidemia are major risk factors for ATH (not reviewed). In AD the situation is complicated because individuals with hypercholesterolemia generally die at a younger age; but, for example, early signs of cognitive impairment are seven-fold increased in patients with hyperlipidemia due to lowdensity lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) mutations [26] .\nPolymorphisms associated with disordered lipid metabolism showing evidence of bias in both diseases include a gene cluster on chromosome 2q14-21: bridging integrator 1/amphiphysin II, BIN1 (2q14) -cytochrome P450, family 27, subfamily C, polypeptide 1 (potential cholesterol hydroxylase), CYP27C1 (2q14.3) -and excision repair cross-complementing repair deficiency complementation group 3, ERCC3 (2q21), over 0.3 Mb. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of lipid metabolic disorders have highlighted further associations with polymorphisms in the genes cholesteryl ester transfer protein, plasma, CETP (16q21); clusterin, CLU (8p21-p12); complement component 3b/4b receptor 1, CR1 (1q32); and low-density lipoprotein receptor, LDLR (19p13.2) (for reviews and databases see [27] [28] [29] [30] and the Catalog of Published Genome-Wide Studies; http://www.genome. gov/gwastudies/).\nHowever, interpreting the link between genes and disease is difficult because (i) GWAS studies require polymorphisms in the population, and genes lacking polymorphisms are therefore not identified, and (ii) it is difficult to dissociate direct causality from indirect association. The exception is the gene encoding apolipoprotein E, APOE (19q13.2).\nThe APOE locus: one candidate gene or several?\nMultiple GWAS studies have firmly highlighted alleles in and around the APOE locus as risk factors for both diseases (http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies/).\nThe APOE gene is located within a tight cluster of genes at chromosome 19q13: poliovirus receptor-related 2/ herpesvirus entry mediator B/nectin-2, PVRL2 (19q13.2) -translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40, TOMM40 (19q13) -APOE (19q13.2) -apolipoproteins C-I, C-II, C-IV, APOC1/C2/C4 (all 19q13.2) -and cleft lip and palate associated transmembrane protein 1, CLPTM1 (19q13.3), over a distance of 0.1 Mb. Although work on APOE alleles has dominated the field (discussed below), linkage disequilibrium between SNPs in different genes suggests that genes other than APOE, notably PVRL2, TOMM40, and APOC1, may influence the development of AD [31] . Attention has focused on an intronic poly (T) polymorphism in different TOMM44 alleles. Although some studies found no association between disease (AD and/or ATH) and TOMM40 variants [32, 33] , others reported associations, but in opposite directions [34] [35] [36] , a possible indication of population-specific risk factors. More detailed analysis [37] indicates that there are several different allelic variants in this poly(T) region, and some appear to associate with age of AD onset. Mice knocked out for another component of the TOMM complex, TOMM5, display a complex inflammatory lung phenotype [38] , but possible predisposition to age-related disease was not studied. There also appears to be complex transcriptional interplay between APOE and TOMM44 [39] .\nOverall, the role of APOE in both AD and ATH has been confirmed independently by multiple studies and by transgenic modeling (below), but it remains open whether linked genes, possibly TOMM40, also contribute to the pathoetiology of AD and/or ATH [40] ."}, {"section_title": "Role of APOE", "text": "The \u03b54 allele at the APOE locus is a major risk factor for both diseases. APOE protein is a lipid transport molecule that circulates in the blood in a complex with lipid-rich lipoprotein particles that transport largely insoluble cholesterol. Lipoproteins, named on the basis of density (principally low-density lipoprotein, LDL; highdensity lipoprotein, HDL; and very low density lipoprotein, VLDL), consist of phospholipids, cholesterol esters, and cholesterols, organized into 20-50 nm micelles with apolipoproteins at their surfaces.\nAlthough detailed summary would be out of place here, it is generally held that LDL and VLDL mediate cholesterol transport between the liver and peripheral tissues [41] [42] [43] [44] . The principal apolipoprotein is APOB100, and both APOB100 and APOE bind to the cellular LDL receptor to facilitate cellular uptake. APOE binding to LDLR (and the LDLR-related receptor, LRP1; the VLDL receptor, and the APOE receptor 2) thereby plays a role in cholesterol delivery. Conversely, HDL particles predominantly contain APOA1, A2, C, and E, and mediate reverse cholesterol transport from peripheral tissues to the liver for secretion into bile [45] , and hepatic uptake is largely mediated by APOA1 binding to specific receptors on hepatocytes. APOE is a minor but crucial lipoprotein component in much of the body, but is the major apolipoprotein in cerebrospinal fluid.\nThere is a third role, where APOE mediates hepatic uptake of intestinally-derived remnant lipoproteins. Cellsurface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) appear to function as a receptor for APOE [46] . In all three roles, APOE is likely to govern export of cholesterol from the cell, and thus the deposition of cholesterols in lipid-rich intracellular aggregates in the vascular wall. Allelic variants of APOE alter the function of the protein in several ways."}, {"section_title": "APOE variants in AD and ATH", "text": "There are three principal alleles at the apolipoprotein E locus, APOE (19q13.2): \u03b52 (cys112, cys158), \u03b53 (cys112, arg158), and \u03b54 (arg112, arg158), giving six different genotypes in human populations, with some further minor variants (reviewed in [47] [48] [49] ); homozygosity for \u03b54 is the greatest risk factor for both AD and ATH, with risk ratios declining generally \u03b54 > \u03b53 > \u03b52.\nThe allelic differences affect APO structure and function. APOE protein contains two structural domains, the N-terminal receptor-binding domain, and the C-terminal lipid-binding domain, separated by a hinge region ( [50] for review). Both polymorphic sites are within the domain (amino acids that includes the receptorbinding site.\nThese changes affect receptor binding. APOE3 shows reduced receptor binding compared to APOE4, and APOE2 is very markedly impaired in LDLR binding (50-fold reduction), although it can still bind to HSPG for hepatic clearance of remnant lipoproteins. APOE4 protein is also more susceptible to unfolding than E3 or E2 [51] . In addition, the polymorphic forms affect lipoprotein association. Notably, APOE2 and APOE3 bind preferentially to HDL particles, whereas APOE4 binds preferentially to VLDL [52] [53] [54] [55] .\nAt a functional level, APOE3 promotes markedly greater cholesterol efflux than APOE4 [56] [57] [58] . In part this may reflect APOE-mediated changes in the expression of the gene ATP-binding cassette, subfamily A, member 1, ABCA1 (9q31.1), a locus identified by GWAS. ABCA1, the key sterol transporter in many tissues, is thought to catalytically 'flop' sterols from one cellular membrane to another, and thus to play a crucial role in transport of sterols out of the cell, with highest activity for sidechain oxidized cholesterols [59] . APOE4 was reported to be impaired, versus APOE3, in upregulating ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux from lipid-laden macrophages [60] . Thus APOE4, versus APOE2/3, is likely to enhance intracellular cholesterol accumulation, a feature of ATH lesions.\nFragments of APOE, like A\u03b2, can be toxic. Similarly to APP, APOE undergoes cleavage, and APOE4 is more susceptible to cleavage than APOE3 [61] . The resulting fragments can cause AD-like neurotoxicity in mouse models [62] and the lipid-binding region of APOE is required for this toxicity [63] . The mechanism and relevance remain unknown."}, {"section_title": "APOE plays diverse regulatory roles: infection and inflammation", "text": "APOE is not a mere cholesterol transporter and is thought to play further roles in tissue repair, immunity, inflammation, and infection [48, 64] . APOE polymorphisms affect not only the function of protein in cholesterol transport but also other processes including infection and immunity (below) and tissue repair. For example, APOE4 was shown to be less effective than either E2 or E3 in promoting neuronal repair [65] but the underlying mechanisms are not understood. What remains open to debate, however, is the exact biochemical process(es) influenced by the polymorphisms that impact upon the risk of ATH or AD development -and indeed whether they are similar in the two diseases or act independently. Studies in animal models are beginning to unravel potentially separable roles of APOE and co-culprits in the two diseases."}, {"section_title": "Familial disease and transgenic models", "text": "No causal and highly-penetrant single gene mutations are known in ATH; modeling the involvement of APOE in transgenic mice has generally relied on the use of knockout mice. Mice knocked out for APOE (Apoe \u2212/\u2212 ), particularly when fed with a high-fat diet, develop atherosclerotic lesions similar to those seen in human ATH [66] . In addition, mice deficient in the APOE-binding LDL receptor (Ldlr \u2212/\u2212 ) develop ATH [67] , further accentuated by humanized APOB [68] , suggesting that differential APOE binding to LDLR may underlie the role of APOE polymorphisms in ATH development. A caveat remains, however, because it is not known whether Apoe knockout affects the function of neighboring genes whose transcriptional control overlaps with that of Apoe.\nIn AD, well-known (but rare) autosomal dominant mutations are known to cause familial disease. Mutations in the gene amyloid beta precursor protein, APP (21q21.3), encoding the precursor to A\u03b2 peptide, are found in many cases of familial AD, notably in a Swedish pedigree that contains a double-replacement within APP protein (Lys595 to Asn plus Met596 to Leu) that facilitates disease-specific cleavage [69] , leading to pathogenic production of A\u03b2 peptide and the deposition in brain of amyloid plaques at an early age. Mutations in the genes presenilin 1, PSEN1 (14q24.3) and presenilin 2, PSEN2 (1q31-q42), encoding key components of the APP processing machinery, have been found in several cohorts of familial AD [30] . These findings reinforce the tight linkage between abnormal APP processing, A\u03b2 deposition, and AD development.\nSingle-gene mutations of this type lend themselves to modeling in transgenic animals, and for many years AD research has dwelt on the expression, in mouse brain, of abnormal AD-associated mutant forms of APP and or PSEN1/2. Mice expressing the Swedish variant of APP [70] [71] [72] show deposition of aggregated A\u03b2, and learning and memory deficits. However, transgenic mice overexpressing mutant AD-related APP (APP AD mice) are likely to reiterate only some aspects of the human disease because (i) APP mutations are rare in sporadic AD, and (ii) A\u03b2 is unlikely to be an essential component of sporadic AD (see later), although it clearly plays a role. Nevertheless, most work in the field has employed APP AD animals as the best available model of AD.\nAlzheimer precursor protein (APP) modulates both AD and ATH AD is characterized by cerebral A\u03b2 deposits and NFT, whereas pathologic vascular occlusion is the hallmark of ATH. However, we see again evidence of a molecular spectrum encompassing both diseases. It is notable that APOE binds to A\u03b2 and facilitates uptake [73] ; APOE4 enhances A\u03b2 production more than APOE3, and synergizes with A\u03b2 toxicity [74, 75] . In AD, A\u03b2 is associated with macrophages and the cerebrovasculature, notably in CAA (Figure 4) , and reduced cerebral blood flow was seen in AD mice brain [14] . Macrophages ingesting A\u03b2 have been implicated in shuttling A\u03b2 between blood vessels and neurons [77] . APP and its toxic fragment, A\u03b2, are also implicated in ATH. Serum A\u03b2 levels are reported to be elevated in stroke patients [79] and A\u03b2 can exert toxic effects on the vascular endothelium [80, 81] . Human ATH lesions have been demonstrated to contain A\u03b2 [82] (Figure 4) . Expression of AD-related APP in a strain of ATH-prone mice led to aortic atherosclerosis [83] , and atherosclerotic lesions in Apoe knockout mice were significantly increased by overexpression of AD-related mutant APP (APP AD mice) [84] . Conversely, genetic knockout of APP function reduced ATH plaque size by up to 90% in ATH-prone Apoe \u2212/\u2212 animals [85] , confirming that APP plays a prominent role in ATH.\nThe APOE paradox: gene knockouts reveal contrasting roles of APOE in AD and ATH models Shared involvement of the vasculature and APP/A\u03b2 in both ATH and AD, together with common risk loci identified by GWAS, underscores the molecular overlaps between the two conditions. Nevertheless, a central factor in both diseases is APOE4, and extensive studies have been carried out in transgenic and knockout mice in the attempt to unravel the molecular role of APOE.\nDisease processes in both AD and ATH are accelerated in APOE4 individuals, whereas E2 and E3 offer a measure of protection. However, the biochemical underpinnings that lead to disease remain obscure. One hypothesis might be that APOE4 protein accelerates uptake of cholesterol-rich particles by the vasculature, leading to more rapid disease progression. Indeed, compared to APOE4, the protective APOE2 and APOE3 proteins show reduced receptor binding.\nHowever, genetic knockout of APOE in mice accelerates ATH [66, 67] , arguing against this interpretation. Similar findings were reported in mice deficient in LDLR [68] , demonstrating that APOE/LDLR-mediated cholesterol export is protective against ATH. Strikingly different observations have been made in AD models. When crossed onto an Apoe \u2212/\u2212 background no amyloid deposits were found in any brain region of transgenic APP AD mice [86] . Vascular pathology was seen in two different lines of APP AD transgenic mice, but when the lines were crossed to APOE knockout animals vascular A\u03b2 pathology was abolished in both types of APP AD Apoe \u2212/\u2212 mice, even in very elderly animals [87] . Reduced AD-like pathology in Apoe knockout mice has been confirmed [88] .\nThis result is a paradox because APOE4 confers greatest susceptibility to both disorders. It is unknown how APOE knockout can accentuate ATH in mouse models, but reduce AD development. We conclude that APOE protein function normally protects against ATH, but co-contributes to AD, suggesting a bifurcation of the pathways leading to ATH versus AD. A potential difficulty is that mice do not reiterate all aspects of either disease, and A\u03b2 alone is not an accurate proxy for human AD. Although true human APOE deficiency is associated with marked risk of ATH [89] , it remains unknown whether such deficiency in human protects against, or accelerates, AD development.\nOther gene knockouts -parallel effects on ATH and AD Although knockout of the Apoe gene differentially affects disease development in ATH and AD mouse models, this was not found for other genes studied. Other knockouts generally influence disease onset/progression similarly for ATH and AD ( Table 1 ). The role of LDLR in AD pathology remains somewhat unclear because LDLR knockout appeared not to affect disease development in one AD model [107] whereas there was a significant increase in A\u03b2 deposition in other APP AD Ldlr \u2212/\u2212 mice [108] , as confirmed [109] , and, unlike APOE, elimination of LDLR appears to increase the severity of both AD and ATH in the relevant mouse models.\nOne may conclude that several common genes act in parallel to predispose to both disorders, but that there is subtle divergence in the molecular pathways leading to one or other disease, notably at the level of APOE. This presents a conundrum that is not yet understood because APOE4 is a risk factor for both diseases."}, {"section_title": "Site of action: the immune system", "text": "GWAS studies and animal models have confirmed that key genes are involved in both ATH and AD and, in addition to cholesterol metabolism, these also address inflammation and immunity. The evidence demonstrates that the immune system centrally determines disease outcome in both cases."}, {"section_title": "Both diseases have an inflammatory component", "text": "Inflammatory pathways have been implicated in both ATH and AD. For example, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are markedly altered in both diseases. CRP, a marker of inflammation induced by interleukins IL-1 and IL-6, binds to phosphocholine, a component of the bacterial cell wall, and has immunomodulatory properties (reviewed in [112] ). In ATH, upregulation of CRP has been known for several decades [113] . For example, CRP immunoreactivity was present in 90% of atheromatous plaques but in only 3% of normal specimens [114] . In AD, there is no evidence for systemic CRP upregulation in blood or CSF, but CRP mRNA levels in brain, particularly in hippocampus, an early site of AD pathology, were increased by over 20-fold versus controls [115] , pointing to local inflammation in the brain. For more extensive summary on inflammation in AD and ATH the reader is referred to recent reviews [116] [117] [118] [119] ."}, {"section_title": "Immune downregulation attenuates ATH and AD", "text": "Multiple studies confirm the central involvement of the immune system in both diseases and, moreover, that The biology of ACAT1 versus ACAT2 differs between mouse and human [110, 111] .

For ATH, M-CSF deficiency resulted in significantly reduced atherogenesis [120] . Song et al. [121] crossed Rag1-deficient mice (that lack mature T and B lymphocytes) with Ldlr \u2212/\u2212 mice, generating animals in which ATH lesion development was markedly reduced; similar findings were reported for Rag-1 deficient Apoe \u2212/\u2212 mice, although only significantly in males [122] . Mature B cell depletion using a CD20-specific monoclonal antibody induces a significant reduction of ATH in various mouse models of the disease [123] . IFN-\u03b3 receptor knockout mice exhibited a substantial reduction in ATH lesion size [105] . Similar findings have been reported for other immune system components (not reviewed).\nIn AD models there have been some inconsistent findings. For example, deficiency of Ccr2 (chemokine C-C motif receptor 2, a protein expressed principally on microglia) was reported to accelerate disease [124] . However, other findings support the view that immune system downregulation prevents AD development. Knockout of IFN-\u03b3 receptor reduced gliosis and amyloid plaques [106] , and blockade of TNF-\u03b1 reduced A\u03b2-induced cognitive impairments [125] . Ablation of CD14, a key molecule in innate immunity, led to decreased plaque burden [126] . DOCK2 (dedicator of cytokinesis 2) is expressed in brain microglial immune cells and modulates cytokine secretion and phagocytosis; knockout was reported to result in reduced plaque area and size [127] .\nIn both diseases, therefore, inhibition of the immune system generally attenuates disease processes. This argues that activation of the immune system is centrally involved in the pathoetiology of both diseases."}, {"section_title": "Site of action: the immune system determines disease development", "text": "The suggestion that the immune system (and potentially infection; below) are implicated in the pathoetiology of both diseases prompts the speculation that key deficiencies, such as of Apoe or Ldlr, only in immune cells, might alone reiterate the disease phenotype of the animal models.\nThe techniques are available to address this issue. If a knockout mouse is irradiated, and then transplanted with bone marrow cells from a wild type mouse, the immune system regenerates, producing a mouse in which the immune system alone carries the wild type allele. Conversely, knockout bone can be transplanted into a wild type mouse, producing an animal in which the knockout is only present in bone marrow-derived cells.\nVan Eck [128] transplanted Apoe +/+ bone marrow into atherosclerosis-prone Apoe null mice, and observed that bone-marrow transplantation led to a marked reduction in ATH lesions. Herijgers et al. [129] transplanted bone marrow from Ldlr \u2212/\u2212 mice into irradiated wild type mice and, despite no significant changes in serum cholesterol or lipoprotein profiles, animals developed atherosclerotic lesions. A similar finding was reported by Fazio et al. [130] . Zhao et al. transplanted bone marrow from ABCA1/SR-BI double knockout mice into ATH-prone mice and reported that this increased disease development, despite an unexpected reduction in circulating cholesterol levels [131] . Similar findings using bone-marrow transplantation have been reported in AD models. Keene et al. [132] transplanted prostaglandin receptor (PTGER2)-deficient (EP2 \u2212/\u2212 ) bone marrow into irradiated APP AD mice, and observed that lesion sizes were substantially reduced in mice receiving knockout bone marrow compared to mice receiving EP2 +/+ marrow. Hao et al. [133] performed a similar experiment with bone marrow deficient in myeloid differentiation factor 88, and reported that the deficiency (in bone marrow-derived cells alone) markedly reduced amyloid burden. Wild type bone-marrow transplantation into APP AD mice markedly reduced cerebral pathology and, conversely, mutant (PS1) bone marrow exacerbated disease [134] . In the most recent study, APP AD mice received bone-marrow transplants from mice expressing either human APOE4 or APOE3. Transplantation markedly reduced pathology, but the APOE3 transplants were far more effective [135] .\nTherefore, for both diseases, at least in mouse models, the genotype of bone marrow-derived cells determines disease development, and not that of the host. This is despite the fact that transplanted knockout animals generally maintain the marked changes in levels of blood cholesterols and lipoproteins characteristic of the host knockout mouse, demonstrating that these systemic changes are not directly responsible for disease development."}, {"section_title": "Central role of macrophages", "text": "Macrophage infiltration and foam cell formation are known to play a central role in ATH disease development (for recent comprehensive review see Moore and Tabas [136] ). The situation in AD is more contentious, but the available evidence indicates that, here again, macrophages play the central role.\nMacrophage infiltration is a feature of AD brain. Macrophage numbers are dramatically increased in AD brain [137] , as seen in HIV-1 encephalitis; infiltration is most abundant in perivascular regions and locates to endothelial tight junctions, A\u03b2 plaques, and macrophages that partially encircle the walls of A\u03b2-rich CAA [137] . Zaghi et al. [77] demonstrated that, in human AD brain, macrophages strongly home to deposits within and surrounding the brain vasculature where they colocalize with A\u03b2 ( Figure 4B ).\nStudies in mouse genetic model confirm a central role for macrophages in both diseases. In ATH, a human APOE transgene under the control of the macrophage lysozyme promoter was crossed into Ldlr \u2212/\u2212 mice; this significantly reduced ATH lesion area [138] . The same finding was reported with macrophage-specific Apoe gene repair in APOE-knockdown mice [139] . Knockouts of PPAR\u03b3 or LRP1 only in macrophages increased lesion size in ATH-prone mice [140, 141] .\nIn AD the situation is complicated because the brain contains both resident brain-specific macrophage-like cells, the microglia, and true macrophages that infiltrate from the circulation. Wegiel et al. have argued that microglia actively promote disease development in APP AD mice and play a pivotal role in amyloid deposition [142, 143] . Simard et al. [144] argued instead that bone marrow-derived microglial cells are protective and can remove amyloid deposits. However, Grathwohl et al. used a microglia-specific cell ablation technique in APP AD mice; nearly complete ablation of microglia had no effect on AD disease development [145] . Hawkes and McLaurin [146] argued that infiltrating peripheral macrophages, rather than microglia, play a central role in clearing A\u03b2 deposits.\nIn a pivotal study, Town et al. used macrophagespecific expression of a dominant-negative form of TGF-\u03b2 in APP AD mice; expression in microglia was absent. Ablation of macrophage TGF-\u03b2 signaling markedly inhibited disease development [147] , confirming that macrophages alone can play a determinant role in AD disease development. For recent reviews on macrophage recruitment into AD brain see [148, 149] .\nThe central involvement of the immune system (and specifically of macrophages) unavoidably prompts the question of whether some infectious component might contribute to disease development in ATH and/or AD. The idea that a common disease condition might have an infectious component is not new. Although initially challenged [150] , Warren and Marshall in 1984 observed that biopsy specimens of patients with gastric ulcers contained spiral or curved bacteria [151] , and received the Nobel prize for their discovery that Helicobacter pylori is a cause of gastric ulcers."}, {"section_title": "Transmissibility of AD", "text": "AD has features of transmissibility. There is intriguing evidence that pathology spreads progressively through the brain from initial foci. Duff and colleagues [152] report that Tau pathology in human AD brain commences in the entorhinal cortex and spreads trans-synaptically from cell to cell. Similar findings were reported in mice by de Calignon et al. [153] who expressed a mutant form of human Tau that predisposes to AD-like pathology in the entorhinal cortex. Pathology propagated from transgeneexpressing neurons to adjacent brain regions lacking any detectable transgene expression.\nThere is direct evidence of transmissibility. Marmosets do not normally develop AD pathology but, when injected intracerebrally with brain tissue from a patient with earlyonset AD, animals developed AD-like amyloid plaques (but no NFT) 6-7 years after inoculation [154] . Non-AD brain tissue failed to transmit disease and the induced degeneration was transmissible to further animals [155] .\nFurther evidence for transmissibility emerges from APP transgenic models in which mice develop AD-like pathology only late in life ( [156] for review). Disease onset was remarkably accelerated by inoculation of extracts of human AD brain into young APP AD transgenic mice [157, 158] . Using 10% w/v brain homogenates from postmortem AD patients, Meyer-Luehmann et al. [158] demonstrated that inoculation into young transgenic mice induced robust deposition of A\u03b2, whereas non-AD brain failed to do so. Similar seeding has been reported when brain extracts from older (diseased) APP transgenic mice are injected into young transgenic animals [158] [159] [160] [161] . Parallel observations have been reported in transgenic mice and rats that do not alone develop disease [162, 163] . Although classic AD-like Tau pathology is generally absent, marking differences between human and murine Tau, NFT were induced when extracts of transgenic mouse AD brain were inoculated into transgenic APP AD mice expressing mutant Tau [164] . Although pretreatment of brain extracts with antibody to A\u03b2 could inhibit seeding, confirming a role for A\u03b2, experiments using synthetic A\u03b2 peptides (1-40 or 1-42), in either soluble or aggregated forms, failed to transmit infection; neither did oligomeric forms of A\u03b2 prepared from cell cultures overexpressing APP [158] . Failure of synthetic A\u03b2 to transmit disease has been confirmed [155] . Rosen et al. [163] state: ' At present, there is no evidence that AD per se is transmissible in the same manner as is prion disease' , and others have suggested that a second factor is likely to be required [165] .\nThese experiments need to be interpreted with caution because A\u03b2 deposition is not an accurate proxy for Alzheimer-type dementia; some individuals with extensive amyloid deposits fail to show significant cognitive impairment (reviewed in [166] ) and clinical trials to remove amyloid deposits have failed to lead to disease improvement. Equally, in the animal models discussed above there has been no demonstration that the animals suffer from a condition that strictly reproduces human dementia. Despite this caveat, the transmissibility of AD pathology has been widely replicated and, at face value, given the failure of A\u03b2 peptides (either soluble or aggregated) to transmit disease, might suggest that a second agent (possibly infectious) may be required for full transmission."}, {"section_title": "Evidence for an infectious component to AD", "text": "For AD, the idea that microorganisms might participate in senile dementia was first proposed by Fischer in 1907 [167] .

Evidence for a causal link between infection and disease is generally based on two types of observations. (i) Statistical association between an infectious agent and clinical disease; however, such associations could be fortuitous, and are often regarded as unconvincing.

Conversely, immunosuppressive Toxoplasma gondii inhibited disease development in an APP AD mouse model [221] . For ATH, diverse experiments in animal models have demonstrated that inoculated infectious agents such as C. pneumoniae persist in atherosclerotic lesions [222] and accelerate ATH development in susceptible mice. For example, C. pneumoniae infection increased aortic ATH in the Ldlr \u2212/\u2212 mouse model [223, 224] , although this has been disputed (e.g., [225, 226] ), and infection can stimulate cholesterol-rich foam cell formation [227] and SMC proliferation [228] , markers of ATH. Infection of ATH mouse models with Porphyromonas gingivalis [229, 230] , H. pylori [231] , or Streptococcus mutans [232] also accelerated atherogenesis.

Germfree Apoe \u2212/\u2212 mice, that are held to be free of bacteria, viruses, and fungi, developed atherosclerosis [238] . However, non-specific immune challenge can precipitate disease. LPS injections alone can increase atherosclerotic lesion size [239] . Vliegen et al. [240] compared the effects of inoculation of mouse CMV (MCMV) with ultraviolet light (UV)-treated MCMV. The inactivated virus increased atherosclerotic lesion area and T cell number in the atherosclerotic lesions, whereas only live MCMV infection increased T cell numbers in the internal organs.\nSimilar findings have been made in AD models. Transmission of disease (see earlier) has been reported but, importantly, heating AD brain extracts to 95\u00b0C reduced (45%) but did not eliminate transmission [158] , arguing for a non-specific inflammatory effect. In support, systemic immune stimulation with the viral mimetic, poly(I:C), during gestation predisposes to AD-like neuropathology [241] . Prenatally stimulated animals had increased levels of A\u03b2, hyperphosphorylated Tau, and NFT formation. Lee et al. showed that injection (i.p.) of LPS into mouse models led to increased levels of A\u03b2 and Tau aggregation [242] .\nIn conclusion, in both ATH and AD, there is strong evidence linking disease development to infection, and overwhelming indications that infectious agents home to diseased tissue and aggravate pathology. Nonetheless, one suspects that any one of several agents can accelerate atheroma formation -and local immune cell activation (via either infectious or non-infectious agents) precipitates disease. In short, infectious agents per se may not be required for disease development (with the caveat that several agents are intrinsic to the mammalian genome, e.g., endogenous retroviruses, not reviewed) but, in the absence of other risk factors, transmissible agents are more than likely to play a determining roleas stated by Epstein et al.

In both conditions, numerous foci of disease replicate the same pattern of progression at different locations. At the same time, there are significant stretches of tissue which are not affected by the disease, despite the presence of all confounding factors for decades since the beginning of the pathological process. The focal nature excludes somatic mutations or other cell-autonomous defects in the cells forming a solid tissue. Instead, a stochastic element, particularly at the initial stage of the disease, is most plausible, and foci of infection are an obvious contender. Subsequent stages may not require direct pathogen involvement, because local inflammation, once established, may persist via the involvement of activated immune cells."}, {"section_title": "Drug overlap", "text": "If the two disorders have a similar etiology, drugs (other than antibiotics, discussed above) effective in one disorder might be expected to show efficacy in the other.

No conclusive benefits have been reported in AD [244] whereas, in ATH, some benefits have been reported, notably in the ASTEROID trial of rosuvastatin [245, 246] , although other trials failed to give unequivocal results [247] .

However, evidence is now emerging that cholesterol and its oxysterol derivatives play potent roles as specific signaling molecules in the immune system.\nCholesterol itself is poorly soluble, but is prone to spontaneous and enzyme-mediated oxidation at the 7, 11, 5-6, 22/24/25/27 positions [297] that increase mobility: for example, efflux of oxidized cholesterol from macrophages is~50\u00d7 faster than of cholesterol itself [298] . Side-chain oxidation is also required for export from the brain.\nOxidized cholesterols are potent signaling molecules. One major pathway is via the liver X receptors (LXR). Although prominently expressed in the liver, where LXR\u03b1 and LXR\u03b2 regulate bile acid synthesis and metabolism/ excretion (reviewed in [299] ), in peripheral tissues receptor activation feeds back to repress cholesterol synthesis and promotes export of excess cholesterol to the liver and bile for excretion. The best natural LXR ligands are cholesterols oxidized at the 22, 24 and/or 25 positions [300] , although 27-hydroxycholesterol (27OHC) has been argued to be the endogenous ligand [301, 302] ."}, {"section_title": "Specific role of 'immunosterol' 25OHC in innate immunity", "text": "Elevated levels of oxysterols are reported in ATH lesions, notably 27OHC and 7\u03b1OHC [303] , and could contribute to atherogenesis (reviewed in [304] ); anomalies found in AD brain include oxysterols, cholesterol precursors, and steroids (e.g., [305] [306] [307] [308] . However, new evidence from Ghazal's group [309] has emerged that one molecule, 25OHC, plays a specific role in regulating responses to pathogens.\nSeveral enzymes are known to catalyze the formation of 25OHC, notably the promiscuous enzyme CYP3A [310] , CYP27 that catalyzes 24, 25, and 27 hydroxylation [311] , and CYP46 that predominantly catalyzes 24S-hydroxylation but also 25-hydroxylation [312] . By contrast, in macrophages (centrally implicated in both ATH and AD), 25OHC synthesis appears to be principally mediated by the key enzyme cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H).\nCH25H is a most unusual enzyme. Unlike classic heme-dependent P450 enzymes (CYPs), that widely catalyze the hydroxylation of hydrophobic compounds including sterols and steroids, CH25H, located in the endoplasmic reticulum, is a di-iron enzyme [313] whose ancestry goes back to yeast. Whereas many CYP enzymes are promiscuous in substrate specificity and site of modification, CH25H appears to be specific for 25-hydroxylation of cholesterol. We have here a glimpse of intriguing evolutionary constraints that deserve to be followed up.\nMacrophage CH25H expression is specifically upregulated by inducers of innate immunity, including LPS, poly (I:C), lipoteichoic acid, specific Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, and by IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b2 [257, 314, 315] ( Figure 7A ). In mice, intraperitoneal administration of a TLR agonist led to marked upregulation of CH25H mRNA, most strikingly in liver (200\u00d7), brain (25\u00d7), and heart (50\u00d7), with a fivefold increase in serum 25OHC levels [257] . Brain expression of CH25H was induced by i.p. LPS injection into mouse [319] , and intravenous injection of LPS in healthy human volunteers resulted in 2-3-fold increase in plasma 25OHC [314] .\nThe specificity of the induction is striking. Ghazal's group [309] screened IFN (\u03b2 or \u03b3)-treated macrophages by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS) for all intracellular and secreted oxysterols, revealing 25OHC as the sole oxysterol produced in response to stimulation ( Figure 7A ). Similar CH25H upregulation and 25OHC synthesis in macrophages was observed in response to viral infection (mouse CMV) [309] . This identifies 25OHC as a specific signaling molecule in response to stimulation of innate immunity.\nIn this context it is intriguing to note that curcumin, a drug with potential activity against both AD and ATH (see earlier), has been shown able to abolish macrophage expression of CH25H following induction of innate immunity [257] ; this could underlie its beneficial affects.\nUpregulation of CH25H enzyme plays a protective role. Blanc et al. [309] demonstrated that 25OHC supplementation in the sub-micromolar range (generally 0.1-1 \u03bcM) induces a broad-specificity antiviral response, inhibiting infections by influenza virus, HSV-1, varicella zoster, and murine \u03b3 herpesvirus 68. Similar potent antiviral effects were demonstrated by Cheng's group for vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), HIV, and a range of acutely pathogenic viruses [320] . Inhibition of mouse CMV proliferation by 25OHC has been confirmed [321] . Although both 27OHC and 24(S)25-epoxycholesterol do display significant antiviral effects [309] , these molecules were entirely absent from stimulated macrophages in the screen of Blanc et al.\nIn further investigation of the mechanism, 25OHC was found to interfere with virus proliferation, and virus plaque size in cell culture was diminished in the presence of 25OHC [309] . It was reported that 25OHC inhibits membrane fusion between virus and cell [320] and, importantly, 25OHC had no effect on the nonenveloped viruses adenovirus 5 or 19a [309] . These findings argue that induction of CH25H in response to infection {or by LPS, poly(I:C), or IFN} protects against viral infection by blocking specific membrane steps in virus entry or maturation. Effects on bacterial pathogens have not been tested, but induction in response to LPS suggests that 25OHC could potentially have antibacterial effects."}, {"section_title": "What is the target for 25OHC?", "text": "This work raises the issue of whether there is a specific receptor for 25OHC, or whether 25OHC nonspecifically interferes with membrane assembly and fusion processes important for pathogen infection and replication. Blanc et al. [309] suggest that 25OHC at higher concentrations (>1 \u03bcm) may have non-specific effects. However, at submicromolar concentrations they report that, unlike 25OHC, a structural enantiomer, 'ent-25HC', was inactive (although some activity was observed at high concentration) in an antiviral assay, and concluded that the antiviral effects of low-concentration 25OHC are mediated by specific receptor binding.\nHow does 25OHC mediate antiviral effects? An effect via LXR and cholesterol metabolism per se seems unlikely because mice lacking CH25H enzyme regulate cholesterol normally [257, 322, 323] . Both 25OHC and 27OHC suppressed IgA production (a correlate of induction of innate immunity) whereas selective LXR ligands were inactive [257] . Synthetic LXR ligands were devoid of antiviral effects [309] . These studies argue that the protective effects of 25OHC are not mediated by LXR.\nOne possibility is that 25OHC is onward metabolized by the widely expressed oxysterol-metabolizing enzyme CYP7B1 [324] to 7\u03b1,25OHC. This molecule is a selective ligand of the G protein-coupled receptor EBI2, and experiments in knockout mice confirm that this route plays a role in modulating antigen-specific immunity. Knockout of either EBI2 or CH25H produced defects in activated B cell migration [322] , and mice deficient in either CYP7B1 or CH25H display defective T celldependent responses [325] . However, this pathway is unlikely to explain the potent antiviral effects of 25OHC because only traces of 7\u03b1,25OHC were detected in the screen of Blanc et al. [309] .\nThe specific receptor for 25OHC therefore remains unknown, although the molecule is known to bind with high affinity to oxysterol binding proteins OSBP1 and OSBP2 [326, 327] , and OSBP-sterol binding has been argued to play a specific regulatory role [328] , notably in modulating OSBP subcellular localization [329] . 25OHC binding to OSBPs may interfere with essential intracellular targeting and delivery of pathogen components (specific intracellular trafficking pathways will differ between pathogens). OSBPs have been implicated in both AD and ATH [330, 331] ; oxysterol binding to OSBPs in macrophages is thought to play a direct role in atheromatous plaque formation [332] and macrophage expression of OSBP2 (OSBP-L1) enhances ATH in susceptible mice [331] . The estrogen receptor ER\u03b1 remains a further contender as a target for 25OHC [333] . However, given the diverse variety of cellular binding sites for cholesterols [334] , unraveling the specific molecular targets underlying the antiviral effects of 25OHC will be challenging."}, {"section_title": "25OHC is implicated in both ATH and AD -the role of ACAT", "text": "In support of a role of CH25H enzyme in both diseases, GWAS studies have implicated the gene cluster cholesterol 25-hydroxylase, CH25H (10q23) -lipase A, lysosomal acid, cholesterol esterase, LIPA (10q23.2-q23.3) in both ATH [335, 336] and AD [337, 338] . The evolutionarily-conserved linkage between CH25H and LIPA, less than 20 kb in all mammalian species examined [339] , is intriguing and suggestive because LIPA (lipase A, or cholesteryl ester hydrolase) is the primary enzyme responsible for deesterification of cholesterol (see e.g., [340] ).\nImmunostimulation leads to induction of CH25H expression and local production of 25OHC. In AD, increasing expression of CH25H in temporal lobe regions of AD brain correlates with Braak (NFT) staging of disease progression [337] . No studies have been reported in human ATH, but elevated levels of 25OHC have been reported in lungs of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [341] , another condition associated with chronic infection [342] .\nChronic overexpression of CH25H is a powerful contender as the culprit for triggering disease pathology because, as first reported by Goldstein and Brown, it has been known for almost 40 years that 25OHC stimulates cholesterol esterification [316] (Figure 7B ). Intracellular cholesterol esterification is catalyzed almost exclusively by ACAT (ACAT1/2) that adds a long-chain fatty acid to the cholesterol 3\u03b2-hydroxy group, and CH25H overexpression and 25OHC synthesis are known to promote ACAT activity, cholesteryl ester formation, and the generation of foam cells.\nCompared to cholesterol itself, oxysterols are highly mobile, but once the 3\u03b2-hydroxy group has been attached to a long-chain fatty acid (principally oleic acid, C18; but also palmitic acid, C16 and other similar fatty acids) the molecule becomes insoluble and prone to aggregation. Although the major sterol in advanced ATH plaque appears to be 27OHC (>80% esterified) [303, 304] , and not apparently esters of 25OHC itself, this may be explained by the fact that 25OHC acts here, not as a substrate, but as an allosteric activator of intracellular esterification.\nWork over many years, notably by Chang's group, has revealed that ACAT enzymes contain two binding sites: (A) the allosteric regulatory site, and (B) the catalytic site. Once a sterol is bound to the A site the enzyme becomes highly active, with promiscuous substrate specificity for a wide range of sterols and even some steroids. Adding 25OHC to the culture medium caused a 20-60-fold increase in sterol esterification without change in enzyme content [317] (Figure 7B ). Crucially, 25OHC is the most effective positive allosteric effector of ACAT; the enzyme is only poorly activated by close analogs such as 7-ketocholesterol, 6-ketocholestanol, 7\u03b1-OHC, cholate, or cholesterol itself [317, 343] (Figure 7C ). 25OHC activation of ACAT takes place in multiple cell types including macrophages [344] and neuronal cells [345] . In addition, it has been suggested that 25OHC drives intracellular redistribution of cholesterols to the endoplasmic reticulum [346] , where ACAT is located; this could afford a second mechanism underpinning the enhancement of esterification. Therefore, by these routes 25OHC triggers the conversion of the intracellular pool of cholesterols (including 27OHC) into insoluble cholesteryl esters, and thus prevents their export (e.g., [347] ). Induction of cholesterol esterification by 25OHC was recently confirmed [321] .\nIn further confirmation of its key role, 25OHC has been shown to promote macrophage foam cell formation in mouse cell culture [318] (Figure 7D ). It is interesting that 3 \u03bcM 25OHC is typically used to stimulate cholesterol esterification, whereas foam cell formation was reported to take place even at a 10-fold lower concentration [318] ; ACAT is thus a further contender as a 'receptor' for 25OHC.\nThe data suggest that chronic overexpression of CH25H is causally associated with disease. In direct support, CH25H gene expression is repressed by transcription factor ATF3 -knockout of ATF3 in susceptible mice led to a marked increase in 25OHC levels and foam cell formation [318] . Ablation of CYP7B1 (that redirects 25OHC by conversion to the EBI2 ligand 7\u03b1,25OHC) increased ATH severity in mice, pointing to a specific predisposing effect of 25OHC itself [103] . Circumstantially, the finding that the expression of CYP7B1, that efficiently metabolizes 25OHC [324] , is downregulated in AD brain [104] is consistent with the interpretation that excess 25OHC contributes to AD.\nThe finding that ACAT inhibition alleviates disease development in models of both ATH and AD (see earlier) confirms that ACAT-mediated sterol esterification, driven by 25OHC, is a key contributor to disease progression. This and other evidence argues that other atherosclerotic features (including disruption of endothelial/smooth muscle cell function and matrix calcification) are downstream consequences.\nWe suggest that chronic production of 25OHC in macrophages leads to ACAT-mediated sterol esterification, the accumulation of insoluble cholesteryl esters, foam cell formation, and vascular occlusion."}, {"section_title": "Hypothesis: inflammation, macrophages, oxysterols, vasculature", "text": "We propose a model in which immune stimulation by pathogens (or components/autoantigens) leads to local induction of CH25H in macrophages. Synthesis of 25OHC confers broad-spectrum inhibition of the growth of enveloped viruses, many of which preferentially target macrophages, and potentially modulates the growth of other pathogens including parasites and intracellular bacteria (Figure 8 ).\nThe downside of this anti-pathogen reaction is, by implication, that chronic production of 25OHC leads to accumulation of cholesteryl esters via the action of ACAT, the formation of fatty inclusions in macrophages, foam cell formation, and vascular occlusion (Figure 3 ). In turn, foam cells lose mobility and reside in situ for extended periods of time, themselves producing proinflammatory stimuli that amplify the pathology, leading to the formation of further atheromatous occlusions in the heart (ATH) or brain (AD) vasculature and overt disease."}, {"section_title": "The role of APP/A\u03b2", "text": "There is evidence that APP and A\u03b2, implicated in both AD and ATH, are themselves involved in oxysterol metabolism. In AD plaques A\u03b2 colocalizes with deposits of APOE and cholesterol [348] . It was first reported that A\u03b2 catalyzes the formation of 7\u03b2-OHC, and in this reaction A\u03b2 was 200-fold more active than APP [349] . More recently evidence has emerged that A\u03b2 has predominant cholesterol 3-oxidase activity [350, 351] , particularly in the presence of divalent cations such as Cu 2+ (a known contributor to AD-like pathology in relevant models). Significantly elevated levels of 3-oxidized cholesterols were reported in brains of APP AD mice and in postmortem brain tissue of AD patients [351] . 3-(or 7-) oxidation has potential to modulate the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in foam cells, although this remains to be demonstrated formally. APOE binding to A\u03b2 [73] may also contribute but the role in disease is unknown.\nHowever, the central involvement of A\u03b2 remains contentious [166] . A\u03b2 does not correlate precisely with clinical diagnosis of AD (reviewed in [352] ), and the failure of A\u03b2 immunotherapy to ameliorate AD pathology in clinical trials (not reviewed here) suggests that A\u03b2 is not central, and is instead subservient to CH25H. This has been confirmed via an unusual route. Papassotiropoulos et al. [337] report that, in large cohort of individuals with confirmed AD, specific CH25H haplotypes were associated with a complete absence of postmortem brain A\u03b2 deposits, despite all other aspects of AD pathology. This argues that inflammation and CH25H activation are upstream to A\u03b2 in the chain of events leading to AD.\nThe downstream induction of A\u03b2 by infection/inflammation raises the question of whether A\u03b2 might in fact be a protective (microbe-sequestrating or inactivating) response rather than a cause of pathology. In support, A\u03b2 was shown to have potent antimicrobial properties, reducing the growth of E. coli by up to 200-fold in vitro, with activity against both Gram-positive and Gramnegative bacteria, and also against the fungus Candida albicans [353] . In the same study, brain homogenates from AD patients showed elevated antimicrobial activity versus control homogenates. It is not yet known whether A\u03b2-catalyzed sterol metabolism plays a role in this phenomenon. It is notable that reduction of A\u03b2 in AD patients was associated with increased risk of infection [354] and, in both of two large clinical trials of anti-A\u03b2 immunization in AD, 6% of patients developed encephalitis of unknown origin (reviewed in [355] ), consistent with a potential defensive role of A\u03b2."}, {"section_title": "The role of APOE", "text": "Given the role of APOE in modulating disease (see above), by pathways that are only beginning to be understood, Robert Mahley argued that the diversification of APOE function, with three alleles prominent in the human population, has been driven by infectious disease. APOE4 is probably the ancestral allele, and is most similar to homologs in other species [356] , and subsequent selection pressure is thought to have led to the emergence of APOE2 and APOE3 [50] .\nThe maintenance of multiple functionally different alleles in a population requires divergent selection -for which sickle-cell anemia affords the best precedent. Briefly, the hemoglobin S allele of \u03b2-globin is generally deleterious, but has a protective effect against malaria infection, and therefore in malaria-endemic areas the deleterious allele is maintained at high levels in the population [357] . This is paralleled by APOE, where APOE4 alleles are protective against some infectious diseases (e.g., malaria) but increase the proliferation of other pathogens (e.g., HSV-1, HIV) (see earlier). As stated by Mahley: ' A cataclysmic event in human history driving the evolution of apoE4 to apoE3 to apoE2 could have been an infectious disease, such as the Great Plague, which killed 30-50% of Europeans in the 14th century, or smallpox' [50] .\nWe have argued here that chronic immune stimulation, leading to 25OHC production, contributes to the development of both ATH and AD. In both cases the APOE4 allele is a major risk factor, and APOE4 can be associated with an increased load of specific pathogens that have been implicated in disease processes.\nHowever, the exact mechanism is unknown. APOE4 is relatively poor at exporting cholesterols, and Figure 8 The foam cell hub (simplified). A model for disease development in ATH; similar processes are argued to operate in AD. Only key pathways are depicted. Challenge by infection or proinflammatory agents leads to induction of IFN signaling (*; both IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3. For the specific pathways involved see [257, 309] and references therein), upregulation of macrophage CH25H gene expression, and catalytic conversion of part of the cellular cholesterol pool to 25OHC. Acutely, this molecule exerts anti-pathogen effects via an unknown receptor. On chronic inflammatory exposure, hydroxylated cholesterols accumulate, are removed to insoluble intracellular inclusions by ACAT-mediated esterification (allosterically modulated by oxysterols, a), thereby leading to foam cell formation and overt disease. Oxidation by APP/A\u03b2 may divert or enhance this process. APOE and ABCA1 are shown at the periphery to emphasize their role in export. Other key components from Table 1 (not shown in the figure) include LDLR, a trans-cellular receptor for cholesterol mobilization, and CLU, a protein with diverse functions in complement-mediated cell lysis, apoptosis, and lipid transport. Abbreviations: ABCA1, ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A (ABC1), member 1 (cholesterol efflux protein); ACAT, acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase (also known as SOAT); APOE, apolipoprotein E; APP, amyloid-\u03b2 (A4) precursor protein (Alzheimer precursor protein); CH25H, cholesterol 25-hydroxylase; CLU, clusterin (apolipoprotein J; complement cytolysis inhibitor); CYP27, cytochrome P450 27A1 (sterol 27-hydroxylase); CYP46, cytochrome P450 46A1 [cholesterol 24(S)-hydroxylase]; CYP7B1, cytochrome P450 7B1 (sterol and steroid 7\u03b1 hydroxylase); EBI2, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced G protein-coupled receptor 2, IFN, interferon; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; LDLR, low-density lipoprotein receptor; LXR, liver X receptor; 25OHC, 25-hydroxycholesterol. therefore would be expected to (i) increase intracellular immunosterols, thereby diminishing the proliferation of immunosterol-sensitive pathogens; and (ii) foster lipid droplet formation and vascular occlusion. This is clearly an oversimplification, because 25OHC in cell culture inhibits several enveloped viruses (e.g., HSV-1 and HIV) whereas, in vivo, APOE4 increases their proliferation. This presents another conundrum that will only be resolved once we begin to understand the full spectrum of immunosterols {25OHC, 27OHC, 24(S)OHC, 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol, and others including cholesterol precursors and 7\u03b1 derivatives}, their targets, and how they inhibit the proliferation of some pathogens while potentially enhancing others. Nevertheless, the evidence causally implicates CH25H in response to infection/inflammation as a triggering factor for cholesterol mobilization, esterification, and foam cell formation. Outstanding questions are summarized in Table 2 ."}, {"section_title": "Concluding remarks", "text": "Brain versus body: why do some individuals develop AD, others ATH?\nThere are significant differences between brain and body; these could explain potential differences in the outcome of systemic infection and inflammation.\nFirst, the brain differs from the body in cholesterol metabolism. In addition to being a net exporter of cholesterol, the CNS produces a brain-specific sterol, 24(S) OHC, known as 'cerebrosterol' [358] . The enzyme responsible, CYP46A1, is predominantly expressed in the brain [312] -most highly in areas affected by AD [359] -and polymorphisms in the gene cytochrome P450, family 46, subfamily A, polypeptide 1, CYP46A1 (14q32.1), have been associated with risk of AD development (e.g. [360] ). It is not known whether 24(S)OHC has specific immunoregulatory effects, but it is certainly plausible to suggest that that activity of CYP46 (also itself a 25-hydroxylase, see earlier) will impact upon the production and effects of 25-hydroxycholesterols, noting that 24(S),25-dihydroxycholesterol resolves to 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol, a further immunosterol with potent biological effects including inhibition of virus proliferation [309] .\nSecond, some infectious agents home selectively to the brain and propagate therein. Examples include encephalitis viruses, poliovirus, rabies virus, and different members of the herpesvirus family. It is possible AD reflects infection and inflammation in association with the cerebrovasculature, whereas ATH is the result of infections propagating in the peripheral vasculature.\nThird, the brain immune system differs from that in other tissues. The brain contains its own specialized macrophage-like cells, the microglia, that share with macrophages the properties of self-renewal, mobility, cytokine-and chemokine-responsiveness, antigen presentation, and phagocytosis, although the brain contains both typical macrophages and microglia. Brain microglia could potentially contribute to AD development, but the evidence is inconclusive.\nFourth, microtubule-associated protein Tau is particularly abundant in CNS neurons, and AD is associated with intracellular aggregates (NFT) of Tau. APOE3 binds avidly to Tau whereas APOE4 shows no significant binding. This interaction may modulate AD development [361] but only make a minor contribution to ATH."}, {"section_title": "Causes, cures, and age-dependence", "text": "In both ATH and AD we see central involvement of vascular pathology, clinical association with common predisposing genes/alleles, association with infection, disease enhancement by immune stimulation, the central role of bone marrow-derived cells, principally macrophages, the involvement of A\u03b2, drug overlap, and cholesterol involvement. These findings suggest that the two diseases share a common pathoetiology. A clear hypothesis is emerging in which chronic infection/inflammation in the vasculature leads, in the short term, to blockade of pathogen proliferation -but in the longer term to 25OHC-driven fatty droplet accumulation and vascular 5 Is A\u03b2 production a cause of disease, or is it a defense mechanism?\n6 Does infection/inflammation in brain microglia also upregulate CH25H expression?\n7 How do we explain the 'APOE paradox' -that APOE4 is associated with highest risk of both AD and ATH, but Apoe knockout in mouse models accelerates ATH but delays AD development.\n8 How do we explain the striking age-related increase in both AD and ATH incidence? Is it due to lifetime changes in circulating steroids/sterols?\n9 Are other age-dependent diseases caused by a similar infection/inflammation/occlusion cascade?\nocclusion. Is a battle being played out in our vasculature, where the accumulation of cholesteryl esters, precipitating ATH or AD, is the price of surviving the onslaught of an invading pathogen? Selective inhibitors of CH25H and/or ACAT may therefore have clinical potential in both diseases; indeed, some widely-available dietary components (with likely activity in these pathways) are under investigation as possible protective agents. Conversely, preventive measures against pathogen infection (e.g., vaccination) are unlikely to be productive, not only because of the diversity of potentially causal agents but also because, for several pathogens, a substantial proportion of the population is already positive from childhood onwards.\nIn addition, remarkably, in some cases early infection could even be beneficial. Barnton et al. [362] report that latent infection of mice with herpes viruses (mouse gammaherpesvirus 68 or CMV) confers resistance to bacterial infection, with a 100-1000-fold reduction in the replication of Listeria monocytogenes or Yersinia pestis (but without effect on a viral pathogen, West Nile virus). Resistance was not antigen-specific, and required chronic IFN-\u03b3 production, suggesting that similar pathways (Figure 8 ) may be exploited by latent viruses -providing a first indication that bifurcation of immunosterol pathways might potentially foster one pathogen at the expense of another.\nThe striking age-dependence of disease is not understood. For many pathogens, infections are acquired in early childhood and remain stable, but for others there is a clear age-related increase in seropositivity rates (not reviewed). A recent exciting development is that macrophages show an age-related decline in the expression of the key cholesterol efflux protein, ABCA1 [363] , implicated in both ATH and AD (see earlier and Table 1 ). However, given that age-related phenomena are controlled systemically rather than being cell-intrinsic (e.g., [364] ), a more attractive hypothesis might be that the well-documented lifetime declines in tissue levels of steroidal molecules such as 7-dehydrocholesterol (a precursor of vitamin D), allopregnenolone, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), that interact with the self-same sterol pathways discussed here, contribute to disease processes. Indeed, protective effects of vitamin D and DHEA in both ATH and AD models have been reported; lifetime changes in androgens and estrogens may also play a role."}, {"section_title": "Ill or just old?", "text": "This debate has highlighted many lines of evidence that two major age-related diseases are likely to be precipitated by infection and inflammation, and are not merely a consequence of age per se. However -in the terms of Izaks and Westendorp [1] -infection/inflammation is a 'component cause' , but not a 'sufficient cause'. There are undoubtedly good reasons to suspect that a systemic age-related component so far unidentified contributes to both diseases. This is an exciting area of research, and one hopes that the next years will bring a new understanding of why some individuals develop AD, others ATH, whereas many avoid both conditions. There are implications for drug development, and drugs with moderate efficacy in either ATH or AD warrant testing in the other disorder. Further research will be necessary to unravel the molecular underpinnings that link infection, oxysterols, and the age-relatedness of these two major diseases. (ii) Acutely, the enzymatic product 25OHC provides protection against pathogen propagation; chronically, macrophage 25OHC activates ACAT, leading to cholesterol esterification, lipid droplet formation, and ultimately vascular occlusion. 4. We infer that, in individuals with ATH or AD, they are neither merely 'Ill' nor 'Old' , but instead both acquired infection/inflammation and endocrine aging are likely to play a joint role in causing these age-related diseases."}]
