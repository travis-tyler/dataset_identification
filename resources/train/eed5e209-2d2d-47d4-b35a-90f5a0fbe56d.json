[{"section_title": "", "text": "In addition to Americans enrolled in foreign programs leading to completion awards, an even larger number participate in study-abroad programs. Such programs do not lead to foreign postsecondary awards and usually do not earn foreign academic credit. Most studyabroad programs are organized by American colleges, universities, or educational organizations' and last from a few days to a year, and may result in academic credit recognized by a U.S. institution. A smaller number of such programs arrange for participating students to enroll directly in foreign institutions and then award credit for the experience upon the students' return, while a few make other arrangements. The Institute for International Education (IIE) reported that 62,341 U.S. citizens were enrolled in studyabroad experiences for credit during the academic year 1987-1988.'0 This number includes only students who received U.S. academic credit (the total of all Americans going abroad for credit and noncredit experiences is unknown but undoubtedly higher). What are the sources of support for students, the pattern and distribution of that support across space (programs, institutions, and countries) and time (over the years), and are these resources being used effectively? What other patterns are revealed from the data? Answers to these questions are generally available for students who have begun and completed their entire educational experience in the United States and in other countries. They are not often available from a comparative perspective, however, and especially not for the growing number of students who migrate internationally during their academic careers. It is important to fill this knowledge gap for three reasons. 1. The United States hosts a large and growing number of foreign students, especially at the graduate level, whose academic backgrounds deserve studying. The number of such students is now nearly onethird of all students completing research doctorate programs in the United States."}, {"section_title": "2.", "text": "The presence of a significant number of foreign students engaged in educational programs that are identical to those pursued by U.S. citizens provides a unique opportunity for comparative analysis of educational backgrounds and how these may influence educational outcomes. 3. International student migration is increasingly a two-way street, with growing numbers of Americans studying abroad in addition to the many foreign students who study in the United States. Data on migrating students are needed in order to assess this important international development and to promote the exchange of information between donor and host countries. An opportunity to answer the research questions stated above exists in the form of the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED), an annual census of U.S. and foreign graduate students who earn research doctorate degrees at U.S. universities, and the related Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR), an annual follow-up survey of U.S. doctorate recipients one year after completing their degrees and entering the workplace. As this report shows, SED provides researchers, policymakers, and the public with a rich source of information on the background, experiences, and future plans of these students."}, {"section_title": "Providing a Useful Comparative Database", "text": "Data collected via SED on foreign respondents' academic backgrounds ceased to be regularly encoded in 1968. The data were partially coded from that year until 1974, when xii encoding ceased altogether. Incomplete and irregular attempts to update the foreign institution code listings have been made since that time, usually targeted at specific countries that have shown significant increases in the numbers of their citizens coming to the United States to study. Because all of the raw data collected since 1967 are retained on microfiche, they are not lost. What has been missing until now are the recognition that these unique data are important to the nation and the means for making them available to researchers and policymakers in an accurate and useful form. The database system used prior to the cessation of international data coding in 1974 was unsatisfactory for a variety of reasons and is now obsolete. That system coded data on U.S. students and institutions separately from data on foreign students and institutions, making comparisons difficult and expensive. It was a limited system that provided data on relatively few non-U.S. institutions and no data at all on institutional characteristics. The proliferation of new institutions, changes in educational systems and to the political status of countries, changes in student migration patterns, and increased knowledge since the late 1960s and early 1970s render the old database system inadequate for current and future applications. Occasional efforts to update portions of the old system were made, but these efforts especially in regard to foreign data were intermittent.' An intensive review of data needs has led the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Education to replace the old database system and to develop CDS in order to do so. The cessation of most international data coding, and the technical problems connected with the system and procedures used until now, have prevented SED from being used as a comparative research tool and thus realizing its full potential. SED is one of the few U.S. databases that covers both U.S. and foreign students in isolable and comparable detail. It includes statistically significant cohorts of both foreign and domestic individuals from different backgrounds who are engaged in the same educational experience, in the same system, at the same time. Background data are collected for all respondents. All that is needed to take advantage of this research opportunity is a valid and reliable way to record and analyze the data. That is the task which CDS is designed to accomplish. In addition to supporting SED, CDS is adaptable to a wide variety of additional uses where comparative and international data are concerned. CDS provides 1.

Among the most important databases providing such information are the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS),\" conducted by NCES, and the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED), conducted by NSF.\" IPEDS collects data on nonresident aliens whc enroll in and complete postsecondary programs in the United States. These data are capable of being broken out by country if and when reported at that level of detail. No data on student backgrounds, characteristics, or future plans are collected via IPEDS other than gender and age. It is important to note that IPEDS data are collected via surveys sent to State Higher Education Executive Officers (SHEEOs), who are usually the directors of a given State's higher education oversight and coordination authority (plus community college oversight bodies where these are separate), and in some cases directly to institutions. The data reportedwhether from the State or institutional leveloriginate in the institutional research offices of cooperating institutions. Thu., the methodology of IPEDS is to survey State and institutional administrations and the resultant data accurately reflect this perspective. By comparison, the methodology of the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) differs from IPEDS in that SED is a direct survey of 13 IIE is a private nonprofit educational organization which promotes international educational exchanges and tracks the enrollment of foreign students in the United States and American students abroad. Data collected via HE enrollment surveys are published annually. See Marianthi Zikoupulos, Ed., Open Doors: Report on International Educational Exc 'range (New York: Institute for International Education, annual). The National Research Council (NRC), using the staff and resources of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), is the contractor for SED. 1PEDS is contracted to the U.S. Bureau of the Census by NCES. In addition to IPEDS, other NCES databases containing collected data on foreign students and former students who study in the United States and work here include the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), the Recent College Graduates Survey (RCG), and the National Survey of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF). students who are at the point of degree completion.' SED is an annual census of all candidates for research doctorate degrees in U.S. universities. Administered annually since 1958, the SED has compiled a remarkably detailed database on students who have reached this level of education, including data on the country of birth, citizenship, and residence of each respondent (including the town and regional subdivision in many cases); and data on previous degrees earned, where, and in what subject(s)all the way back to secondary graduation. SED has a far broader importance than its name implies because the database provides such an extensive record, over many years, of students' histories, socioeconomic information, demographic characteristics, and financial and work-related information. The survey includes bath U.S. and foreign citizens who earn American doctorates. Since foreign citizens now number between 20 and 30 percent of all U.S. doctorate recipients, SED provides a rich source of comparative information.\" The population surveyed via SED comprises all U.S. citizens, resident aliens, and nonresident aliens who have passed the final examinations for research doctorates at U.S. postsecondary institutions and are about to be awarded their degrees. Response rates have averaged over 95 percent annually for both U.S. and foreign respondents. There have been 16 Users of these surveys should be aware of why these important differences in methodology exist and how they affect published results. A survey of institutional data, such as 1PEDS, will obtain statistics as compiled by administrative offices and thus will reflect the guidance under which they operate. For example, program completion data will reflect the titles of degrees that institutions are legally authorized and accredited to award, such as history and physics. They will not necessarily reflect the specializations within these broad degree categories that students and faculty recognize, such as European History or Particle Physics, unless these are separate authorized programs. By contrast, students and faculty who may respond to a survey such as SED or SDR will tend to report their specializations, especially if asked what they are concentrating in or researching. These different sample populations--students, faculty, and institutional administratorsmay therefore produce different responses to what superficially appears to be the same question but in fact is not. It is important for research and policy purposes to ask the different questions that IPEDS and SED ask, and to address these questions to different audiences. Institutions and States are arguably in the hest position to report information on overall trends and current facts concerning authorized degree programs, budge, staffing patterns, facilities, and the like. What they report will correspond to their official definitions and be aggregated within defined categories. Likewise, faculty and students are arguably in the best position to report on what is going on within their fields and what is happening to them in terms of academic experiences. Both types of information are useful, and the fact that the resulting statistics may occasionally differ reflect differences in research questions and methods."}, {"section_title": "17", "text": "While SED has been administered since 1958, surveys of doctoral recipients have been conducted since 1920 by the National Research Council, the National Science Foundation, and the U.S. Office of Education (predecessor to the U.S. Department of Education). A synopsis of historical survey data may be found in Lindsey R. Harmon,.4 Century of Doctorates: Data Analyses of Growth and Change, (Washington: National Academy of Sciences, 1978). Historical data from early SED years may be found in Research Division, Office of Scientific and Engineering Personnel, Doctorate Recipients from United States Universities: 1958-1966, (Washington: National Academy of Sciences, Publication No. 1489. More recent SED data are summarized annually in Summary Reports prepared by the Doctorate Records File Staff, Office of Scientific and Engineering Personnel, National Academy of Sciences, and published by the National Academy Press on behalf of the National Research Council. These reports contain detailed methodological explanations and include copies of the survey instrument. slight changes to the survey instrument since 1958, but basic data elements have not changed. Response rates for each survey item have been very high; none have fallen below 80 percent, and foreign students have responded to all items at rates similar to American students.' Data are collected on the origins, academic backgrounds, current program of studies, and future plans of respondents. Origins data include the individual's place of birth, birth date, and country of citizenship. Academic background data include the year of secondary school graduation and data on previous postsecondary credentials earned, comprising the title of each credential, the date it was awarded, the subject field, and the name of the institution which awarded it. Current program data include the name of the institution and the department (or college or faculty) in which the respondent is studying for the doctorate, the subject field of the doctorate, the date that the doctorate is to be awarded, and the title of the dissertation. Future plans data include the status of the respondent's job. search (firm employment offer or not), the sector of planned employment (private, public, academic), whether the respondent plans postdoctoral study, and where the respondent plans to locate (country and U.S. state if applicable). These time series data, collected on nearly all recipients of research doctorates from U.S. postsecondary institutions for over 30 years, constitute a major resource for comparative educational research. The data permit the analysis of variables concerning parPlel cohorts of American-and foreign-educated individuals undergoing a similar educational experience at the same time and place under the same circumstances. Comparisons are possible regarding such issues as how different background experiences relate to students' current programs of study, educational progress, and work plans. The database provides longitudinal depth as well as comparative breadth, and is methodologically sound and statistically validated. SED and the follow-up Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) data can directly support important current research on issues related to U.S. national interests, including Determining how products of U.S. education perform in comparison with their foreign counterparts outside an artificial testing environment; Determining how U.S. minority and female students perform in graduate education in relation to other groups, including foreign minorities and women; Mapping how students switch fields and how this affects available human resources and high-end labor planning; lb Data on SED response rates are provided in an appendix to each annual Summary Report on SED data published by the survey contractor, the National Research Council (NRC). In addition, historical analyses of SED and predecessor survey data are discussed in two multiyear studies: Fred D. Boercker and Lindsey R. Harmon, Doctorate Mapping different patterns of access to graduate studies and progress to the doctorate by type of previous education, gender, ethnicity, and subjects studied; Helping to answer the question of whether opportunities to study in the United States go to foreign elites or whether this assistance reaches a broader clientele, and do so by country; Helping to deepen our understanding of the liguistic proficiency of foreign students studying in U.S. graduate programs; Mapping differential outcome patterns for graduate education, including employment, migration, and supply and demand questions; and Linking data on graduate-level education patterns and outcomes to broader economic and social questions. Data collected via SED reflects the fact that students come to the United States from nearly every nation and territory in the world. These students present prior credentials and biographical histories revealing a tremendous variety of experiences, including academic migration and changes in residence and citizenship. While certain nations tend to provide the most foreign students from year to year, the provider nations tend to fluctuate over time and cannot be predicted with any permanent degree of assurance:9 From the outset, therefore, the scope of the CDS design task has had to encompass every territorial locality in the world and data on the the credentials, programs, and institutions of each known system of education. Each graduating doctorate recipient is asked to participate in the SED census, so that data collected include most foreign as well as U.S. citizens who earn U.S. doctorates. (Follow-up data are collected for doctorate recipients who enter the teaching and research professions in America via the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR).) Each respondent to SED provides data on his or her educational background prior to the doctorate (degrees, subjects, dates awarded, and awarding institution), when and where high school was completed, personal background data (permanent address, place of birth, country of residence, country of citizenship), data on parental education and work, sources of support for graduate study, field of doctoral study, date of doctorate award, and immediate plans (intended place of residence, type of work to be done, whether a job is on offer). The response rates have always been remarkably high, averaging over 90 percent each year since SED began for each item. Foreign student response rates have also been high. In numbers of students abroad. Even the major provider nations have changed over time witness the replacement of several European nations as major suppliers of U.S. doctoral students by Asian ones during the 1970s. See Chapter IV of Boercker and Harmon, 1967, op. cit.;Chapter 2 of Harmon, 1978, op. cit.; and the special report entitled \"Non-U.S. Citizen Doctorate Recipients\" in Delores H. Thurgood and Joanne M. Weinman, Summary Report 1989: Doctorate Recipients from United States Universities (Washington: National Academy Press, 1990). 1992 some 98.5 percent of nonresident alien respondents provided data on their country of origin; 82.1 percent provided data on postsecondary programs completed and institutions attended prior to earning the U.S. doctorate; 68.6 percent provided data on their sources of financial support; and 91.2 percent provided data on future employment and location plans.\" These response rates are close to those for U.S. respondents and indicate that useful amounts of comparative data are being collected. Since these data have been consistently collected since 1958, the United States possesses over 35 years of potentially revealing comparative data on how American and overseas students perform in common graduate education experiences and subsequent employment in relation to their different educational backgrounds. Handling such a large and complex array of data requires the use of classification systems capable of serving each data organization task and capable of being used as complimentary and valid components of an overall database management system. The ;:pecific classification problems needing solutions for SED data coding and analysis include Countries of the world; Jurisdictions within countries; Locations within countries and jurisdictions; Postsecondary institutions; Degrees and other awards; and Languages used to provide instruction."}, {"section_title": "Technical and Policy Considerations", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The Aims of Comparative Research", "text": "Comparative research seeks to identify and analyze the similarities and differences among macrosocial units and their formal and informal institutions and systems, and by doing so to better understand social processes, explain outcomes, and interpret the significance of these developments for interested audiences. The objects of comparative research are frequently real-world entities rather than theoretical constructs, and these entities are complex and well-known units, such as whole societies. Even if the unit of analysis is at the individual or institutional level, the ultimate conclusions are aimed at a broader level of aggregation. For example, a case study of school behavior in a few selected schools in a few cities may lead to general observations about education in the societies in which the cities are located. Comparative research has tended to seek holistic explanations of complex phenomena (such as how Japanese and American students differ in learning mathematics), and comparativists have historically leaned toward qualitative methods. In part, these tendencies are due to problems that impede quantification, such as the expense and logistics of conducting research on large samples; the lack of wide variation due to few samples; and the existence of too many exceptional cases within the available samples, thus rendering them too small and complex for valid analysis. When research conditions are adequate, however, quantitative methods may be and have been used to address comparative questions.' The technical factors that hinder comparative research thus include the costs and logistical difficulties of assembling basic data; data comparability; data validity and reliability; problems of creating meaningful analytical designs for data arrays; and bias.' SED is important as a comparative research tool because it overcomes most of these traditional difficulties. Sample Size. SED is a census in which the population universe and sample are the same, and that population has varied from a low of 8,770 (1958) to a high.of 38,814 (1992). The U.S. citizen subpopulation has ranged in size from 8,469 (1960) to 33,755 (1973, the alltime high) while the foreign citizen subpopulation has ranged from 1, 176 (1960) to 11,846 (1992). These subpopulations have each been sufficiently large in every reporting year to permit multivariate statistical analysis. Indeed, the annual respondent totals for several countries of origin within the foreign subpopulation have been large enough to permit focused statistical analyses of their residents who obtain U.S. doctorates (see Chapter 2). The high survey and item response rates alluded to previously reinforce these observations on SED sample size. Sample Variation. The variation across each SED variable is extensive enough, when taken together with sample size for each variable item, to eliminate most cases of insufficiency. Furthermore, the cases in which potential variable cell counts arc ,.)o small to permit-statistical analysis are often capable of aggregation (such as regional groupings of small country samples) to a level at which analysis is possible. Such aggregation does not result in useless or false outcomes; the country samples which need to be aggregated belong to distinct regions (stich as the Caribbean, Central America, and East Africa) which share common characteristics and sometimes educational consortia arrangements (West Indies and East Africa Examination Councils, for example). Data Comparability. SED is unique among large-scale comparative databases in that the respondents are all engaged in common educational activities within the same system and institutional framework. Each student, whether American or foreign, is earning a research doctorate at a U.S. postsecondary institution. And while minor variations in program and regulations exist across U.S. institutions, these are minimal at the doctoral level due to accreditation requirements and the pressures of standardization within disciplines and in the labor market. Thus the conditions creating and surrounding the data sample are similar and do not need special preliminary comparative treatment in order to be usable. (For the exceptions to this observation see Data Array, below.) 21 See Charles C. Ragin, The Comparative Method: Moving Beyond Qualitative and Quantitative Strategies (Berke!. y: University of California Press, 1989), Preface and Chapters 1 and 2; and Edmund J. King, Comparative Studies and Educational Decision (London: Methuen, 1968), Chapter 3."}, {"section_title": "22", "text": "Heinz J. Noah, \"Methods in Comparative Education,\" in T. Neville Postlethwaite, ed., The Encycloped:,, of Comparative Education and National Systems of Education (New York: Pergamon Press, 1988), p. 10. Data Validity and Reliability. SED is continuously validated and tested to maintain data quality, and the entire process from initial data collection to the publication of products and refined data files is monitored by the contractor, NSF, and the cognizant agencies sponsoring the survey as well as review panels of external users and data providers. Since the foreign and U.S. respondent data are collected during the same annual administration of the survey, and in view of the comparability of these data, there are no unique prcblems of data validity and reliability that would need additional attention. Data Array. There are no special data array problems for data pertaining to activity common to both the U.S. and foreign respondent subpopulations. Background data pertaining to the period prior to enrolling in the U.S. doctoral program are another matter. While some foreign SED respondents will have lived and studied in the United States before entering doctoral programs, most will have not and will therefore report data on non-U.S. education programs and institutions, as well as personal background data, that present special problems. Foreign respondent background and educational history data require the implementation of CDS in order to be coded in ways that permit comparisons with similar data for U.S. citizens. Bias. Statistical bias in SED data are treated via validity and reliability monitoring and the adjustments needed to achieve adequate sample size and variation. Ethnocentric bias in the comparative research component of SED is handled in two ways. First, it is understood that since SED data are collected within the context of the U.S. educational system, a degree of bias is unavoidable. That bias concerns the U.S. doctoral programs (and any other U.S. educational programs) that respondents complete. Since such data are authentic to the United States, one can argue that this type of bias is not damaging to an analysis of SED data. Second, potential bias regarding background data is significantly reduced by using a common geographic data system for all migration data (U.S. and foreign locations) and a common education program and institution coding system. The CDS program and institutional coding process, described below, is based on the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), and thus avoids imposing exclusively U.S. educational concepts on the data set. Cost and Logistics. CDS greatly reduces the cost and logistical difficulty of obtaining and analyzing these comparative data. The great majority of the geographic, programmatic, and institutional data coding and array problems are resolved, thus reducing the time and expense of accessing the data. More fundamentally, the existence of SED means that these data are routinely collected as part of a larger research enterprise. There is no need to design a new comparative research program to obtain the information."}, {"section_title": "Technical Soundness", "text": "A technically sound comparative data coding system will be able to handle different practices among national systems of education with minimal distortion. It will not necessarily resemble any particular system, but will capture and present statistical data in meaningful ways using valid operational criteria. To be meaningful, such a system should be organized around educational concepts pertaining to vertical progression which are widely accepted, including concepts such as \"primary,\" \"secondary,\" \"postsecondary,\" \"undergraduate,\" \"postgraduate,\" and others. It will do the same for concepts relating to the types of education represented (fields of study, institutional type), characteristics of educational experiences (such as the language used in instruction), and the geographic diversity reported (regions, countries, and within-country locations). The operational definitions developed from these concepts will of necessity involve arbitrary parameters that permit quantitative data collection, organization, and analysis. Nevertheless these operational parameters should be based on defensible, logical concepts. Designing a comparative and international database presents several challenges. These include Identifying the aims of the comparative research project, including providing appropriate theoretical and practical justifications; Creating an overall research plan; Identifying the data that require special coding in order to be manipulated for comparative purposes; Developing valid conceptual definitions and selecting the methodolgical approach that will guide the design of the comparative database and integrate it into the rest of She database and other research applications; Developing technically acceptable operational definitions of key variables which can produce valid statistics; Insuring that these concepts and definitions are also sound from a policy perspective; Validating and refining the database design through rigorous peer review and pilot testing; and Implementing the final database design."}, {"section_title": "Policy Soundness", "text": "Policy considerations are related to these technical demands. Comparative theory and policy requirements are in agreementfor different reasonsin calling for a technical solution to coding data from various systems of education that avoids imposing a specific national system onto other systems of education. Bilateral and multilateral equivalency determinations are made every day in each country that needs to resolve student migration and credit allocation issues. But these determinations are not made by government authorities in every country, nor do they necessarily meet the needs of database design. Equivalency determinations are usually made on a case-by-case basis, and the rules for such decisions involve a variety of legal, political, and economic issues besides technical issues of educational comparison. Nor are the same decision rules always applied consistently across all cases, especially in situations where decisions are made at the institutional or even the faculty level. Even consistent national policies and rules can create technical problems, for these guidelines are often the result of negotiations driven by factors other than comparative accuracy and result in inflexible criteria which ignore important variations. For these reasons, a politically sound educational data coding system, like a technically sound one, will be able to handle a variety of national practices and will be linked to a widely accepted set of guidelines and concepts that have received official endorsement. The data that CDS will control are collected from students currently studying in the United States, regardless of where they may have studied previously. Any database design that is to be used to collect and analyze data from experiences within the U.S. educational system, as with that of any other system, must reflect the realities of that system insofar as they affect the behavior being studied. Thus CDS departs from a strictly system-neutral design when necessary in order to reflect U.S. policies and practices regarding the admission of students to U.S. postsecondary institutions; to not do so would result in erroneous data collection and analysis. Reconciling U.S. interests and the need to reflect international practices is not as difficult as it may seem. Americans are interested in accurate information on the large and growing numbers of non-U.S. citizen.; who enter and graduate from U.S. postsecondary institutions and who subsequently obtain jobs both here and abroad. Important issues relating to foreign assistance, foreign policy, national security policy, immigration policy, educational policy, labor and human resources policy, and economic policy all benefit from good comparative data. The data on the thousands of foreign students who study in American institutions and graduate from them each year must somehow be processed, as must data on U.S. citizens who attend foreign institutions and then come back to America. A system is needed that can handle both U.S. and foreign educational data and present these data in a format that is helpful to American users and others."}, {"section_title": "An ISCED-Based Coding System", "text": "The only system in the world that has the advantage of widespread technical and official support as a means of presenting educational level data is the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED). It is the accepted international standard for reporting such data, and it or an adaptation is used by a majority of the world's countries. ISCED is a system that currently employs 8 levels to organize educational program data. These levels are conceptually broad and require users to collapse data on a number of different l0 programs into common categorical \"bins.\" Also, while ISCED actually contains a total of 10 possible levels, two of them (4 and 8) have not been used. Fortunately, the disadvantages with the current basic ISCED system can be overcome while Maintaining the system's technical and political viability. UNESCO is currently involved in revising ISCED, and insertion of the two unused levels is being actively considered. At the same time, an international organization related to UNESCO the International Association of Universities (IAU) has implemented an educational level coding system based on dividing each broad ISCED level into one or more sublevels. The IAU has accomplished this by assigning a two-digit code to each ISCED level and then assigning institutional and individual level (degree award) data to operationally defined subcodes, up to ten for each broad level. Since both the UNESCO revision of ISCED and the IAU coding project are official activities, and since most countries (including the United States for purposes of data exchanges) participate in UNESCO activities, employing these adaptations is both politically sound and results in technical improvements to the system. For these reasons the CIDS system is linked, where possible and where appropriate, to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) and the International Association of Universities' (IAU) Trans Regional Academic Mobility and Credential Evaluation Information Network (TRACE) database.' The chief adaptation necessary for U.S. purposes is to accomodate the flexibility an variety inherent in the U.S. approach to awarding academic credit. American decisic.is on awarding credit are made by institutions, not government authorities at any level, and these decisions are governed by rules and customs evolved over time to aid in evaluating transcripts, test results, and other items in student portfolios and files. These decisions are made on a case-by-case basis. In addition, American postsecondary educational philosophy places a great emphasis on general education, does not tend to segregate occupationally oriented study from academic or research study, increasingly promotes interdisciplinary study, and vigorously pursues policies intended to maximLe access and opportunity. The net effect of all of these qualities of American practice is that American decisions regarding admission, placement, and creditworthiness of foreign students and their academic credentials do not always follow the policies prevailing in the countries where such credentials were originally earned. Nor are there formal, legally authorized rules and regulations governing such decisions. The solution used in CDS is to incorporate U.S. practices in the assignment of codes for educational levels. These are discussed in Chapter "}, {"section_title": "The Necessity for a New Comparative Database System", "text": "Obsolete Geographic Data System. SED respondent data pertaining to geography and institutional experiences were historically coded using two systems. Data pertaining to U.S. institutions were coded using a six-character code string that identified each institution by state of location, assigned it a unique identification number, and indicated whether it was a branch of a parent institution. Individual respondent background data for U.S. citizens included (and still include) state of residence and mailing address. Foreign institutional data were coded using a five-digit code string that assigned each institution a unique identification number, and also identified the country and the geographic region in which the institution was located. Country codes in the old system were assigned to those entities indicated by respondent as their place of birth, residence, citizenship, or future plans, as well as locations of identified postsecondary institutions. The country code list did not include all countries known to exist and which might be indicated by a respondent. On the other hand, the list included occasional multiple code assignments to the same country due to new codes being assigned each time coders came upon a political or name change. This practice had, by 1991, created three listings for Germany, two for Pakistan, and two for Burma. And, because United Kingdom data are often reported internationally by component state (Scotland, England and Wales, Northern Ireland), coders had literally copied this practice and the code list possessed no aggregate code for the entire country.\" Regional location was coded using a set of country groupings roughly based on time zones, meridians of longitude, and (in some cases) parallels of latitude. These regional assignments were not related to any of the groupings commonly used to analyze international developments. The differences included Imbalances in the number of regional codes per continent (five for Europe versus two each for Africa and Asia) that did not reflect the proportions of students coming to the United States from these areas in the years since the system was created (1960s); The absence of any regional codes for some important and recognized regions (Middle East, North Africa, Southeast Asia, South Asia, East Asia, etc.); and Confusing assignments of some countries to regions based on the criteria described above (Malta and Italy in Central Europe; Greece in Eastern Europe; England in Northern Europe; Egypt and South Africa in Eastern Africa; India and Israel in Western Asia; etc.).25 Obsolete and Invalid Degree Data System and Methodology. The procedure used to code foreign degree data involved an effort to determine direct equivalency between specific U.S. and foreign postsecondary awards. Coders were using reference material, brief guidelines, and a short, incomplete, list of foreign degree titles which contractor staff had determined to be equivalent to U.S. awards, especially the bachelor's degree.\" The coding procedure, in addition, was based on the assumption that the line (out of six available) under SED instrument Item 13 (Colleges and Universities Attended) which respondents would use to report their \"B.A. Equivalent\" degree could be predicted. The predicted line under Item 13 had been the only one coded and the resultant data were linked to data from Item 14 (Years of Full-Time Attendance Between First Baccalaureate or Equivalent and Doctorate), to calculate time-to-degree. The procedure was intended to save time and expense by reducing the coding burden to a single row in Item 13. The underlying principles governing this degree data coding procedure were (a) that case-bycase decisions on degree equivalency could be reliably made; (b) that such decisions could be made by coders exercising independent judgements; (c) that such decisions would be the same as those reported by respondents via Item 14; and (d) that interrater reliability problems would not seriously affect data quality from year to year and across successive groups of coders. Seeking an efficient, reliable, and cost-effective means for coding masses of foreign degree data was a laudable goal. However, direct bilateral equivalency determinations were not a satisfactory solution for a number of reasons. (1) U.S. educators have not worked out precise equivalencies in all cases of bilateral student mobility. (2) Agreements between U.S. and foreign authorities regarding mutual equivalency recognition do not always exist, and foreign governments and institutions do not necessarily agree with the equivalency determinations developed in the United States, or vice versa. ( 3)Establishing unilateral equivalency determinations involves elaborate justification in each case; each case often involves a variety of issues specific to it and unlike others; and the resulting individualized decisions may not meet the consistency requirements for a statistical database. (4) Maintaining a system based on a complex series of unilateral, individualized decisions requires a massive expenditure of time and effort in order to regularly check every supporting authority, and is therefore cost ineffective if repeated annually."}, {"section_title": "26", "text": "Office of Scientific and Engineering Personnel, \"Partial List of Degree Designations Awarded at Foreign Educational Institutions,\" Unpublished memorandum, (Washington: National Research Counci: 'o date); and FY 1989 Survey of Earned Doctorates Questionnaire Coding Manual, (Washington: National Research Council, 1989). 5Since direct judgements about degree equivalency are handled on a case-bycase basis by educators at the institutional level in the United States, independent determinations at the federal level might be misunderstood as interference with the freedom of faculties and administrators to decide questions of content, academic standards, and admissions, and of institutions and exchange sponsors (including other federal agencies such as the U.S Department of State) to promote exchanges. (6) No completely reliable prediction as to how respondents would complete SED instrument Item 13 could or can be made, since the six lines are not numbered, instructions for ordering responses by lines and degree types are not given, and individuals may vary as to how many prior degree completions they listquite apart from the question of whether such degrees might be deemed equivalent to U.S. associate, bachelor's, or master's degrees. On top of these problems were the questions of coder expertise, interrater reliability across coder staff turnover, and the quality of the guidelines available to coders. Allowing coders to make substantive decisions about how data are encoded was not a common procedure in 1968, nor is it now. To work, such a procedure requires expert coders, up-to-date references, thorough guidelines and rules to minimize variations among decisions reached by different coders, and the time and money necessary to support a laborious effort and pay for coders who are really consulting experts. These factors are rarely all simultaneously present, especially when the coding task has a low priority, the total coding task is very large, and the timelines (annual data publishing in the case of SED) are tight. The nature of the coder instructions available under the old SED foreign data coding system, and the observed patterns of coding, have resulted in the conclusion that these procedures were not working very well.\" 27 The instructions given to coders advised them to refer to institutional commencement programs and to the IAU's International Handbook of Universities and to the Commonwealth Universities Yearbook. Coders also had available the fruits of special efforts to update institutional and degree lists, such as a 1989-1990 updating of Chinese lists. Such resources do not seem to have helped, since the author personally examined the entire list of FY 1990 raw data marked \"unknown\" by coders and found that it numbered 1,319 entries (10 percent of the total foreign student response for that year). Of these unknowns, which contained a large number of Chinese responses, the author noted that some 90 percent could have been identified from the reference resources supposedly available to SED coders. Either these were not in fact available or they were not used. The coder instructions were equally problematic. No guidance existed on degrees awarded by several major suppliers of foreign doctoral candidates, such as Pakistan, Iran, Egypt, Israel, Nigeria, all Francophone countries except France, and others, while coders were instructed to use Argentina as a model for Spanish South America and Australia as a model for the entire British Commonwealth, including Canada, East and West Africa, and the Caribbean. China was treated by the notation \"See Taiwan,\" and Eastern European countries were not covered because at the time the system was developed very few students from behind the Iron Curtain were coming to America. Other problems and errors included instructions to code the German Staatsexamen and Diplom-Universit at and the Italian Laurea as U.S. bachelor's degrees; code the French Doctoral 3eme as a Ph.D.; listing the Mantra as a German secondary diploma: instructions to code no business diplomas as postsecondary degrees, but to code all nursing diplomas as postsecondary: and recognition, for some reason, that Polish degrees are not strictly equivalent to U.S. degrees but no such instruction Obsolete Institutional Data System. The old foreign institutional coding system also included organizations that were not educational institutions, such as embassies, research associations and facilities, scholarship committees, and U.S./local country friendship . societies.\" Foreign individual background data were treated similarly to that for U.S. citizens except that no effort was made to systematically collect information on withincountry subdivisions of origin (such as states, provinces, prefectures, etc.), and mailing addresses were not encoded. Occasional efforts to update portions of these coding systems were made, but these effortsespecially in regard to foreign datawere intermittent.\" A practice of adding institutional codes only as responses demanded, and the low priority assigned to foreign data coding after 1967, resulted in a woefully outdated and patchy code list. The overwhelming demands that the old system made on coders, particularly the reliance on them to be experts in comparative education and stop to look up evidence and decide each case, were resulting in increased error. In addition, the old coding system was really two systems, which meant that even correctly coded data on U.S. and foreign respondents could not easily be analyzed without erecting a crosswalk between the systems. Making all the changes necessary to improve matters would entail the creation of a new system. This step would not, of course, eliminate all errors, especially those caused by vague responses or nonresponses. But it would reduce the size of the error count, and the cost of coding. Accessing the foreign data would again become a feasible proposition. for any other country. Coders were expected to make their own judgements based on these guidelines and references. Further coder instructions included a decision rule to isolate the \"Foreign B.A. Equivalent\" data by selecting one tine of the Item 13 response (All Colleges or Universities Attended) as the \"B.A.\" line, ignoring the others. Foreign data included in analyses such as time-to-degree studies were based on these extraordinarily cryptic, misleading, sometimes contradictory, and inaccurate instructions. Inspection of the old SED coding manuals showed that institutional codes were often assigned in error to branch campuses, affiliated colleges, residential colleges, and other parts of degree-granting institutions. Institutions that were in fact independent were sometimes treated as branch campuses of other institutions and not assigned their own codes. Names were confused as well; the University of Bucharest, for example, was assigned two codes because successive coders had apparently not realized that a name change referred to the same institution. Coders failed to locate institutions already assigned codes. The \"unknown\" list for FY 1990 included, among other errors, the University of Toronto, the Sorbonne campus of the University of Paris system, and the Beijing Agricultural Universityall institutions contained in the extant code lists."}, {"section_title": "28", "text": "The National Research Council assigned codes to these entities to track the doctorate earning patterns of students sponsored by international fellowships and exchanges, all of whom had (and have) to be cowonsored by the foundation providing support, the authorities in the home country, and the local United States Embassy.

(For a complete discussion of these codes and a listing of all codes used in CDS, see Chapter 4 and Section 2 of this volume.) The coding system consists of new identification codes for countries of the world, postsecondary institutions, and postsecondary program completion awards. These identification codes are joined by a series of variable codes which provide additional data about each subject. The new coding system is premised on the observation that each data element, or code assignment, refers to something (country, institution, degree) about which much is known besides its basic identity. There is no reason why some of these additional facts cannot be added to the database as variables by means of embedding them, via subcodes, in the code strings identifying each element. Such layering can considerably expand the basic data record. The SED Data Items Coded Using CDS Not all of the comparable data collected via SED require special treatment. The two types of respondent data which require CDS coding are data pertaining to a respondent's personal background and plans, and data describing the educational programs completed and institutions attended.

In the case of a database such as SED or SDR, which keys on educational program completions, level is expressed in the form of earned postsecondary degrees or other awards. For purposes of CDS, educational level is a concept defined similarly to its use in the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED). ISCED defines levels as \"categories representing broad steps of educational progression from very elementary to more complicated learning experiences.\" ISCED ignores national level distinctions made on the basis of type of educational program (such as vocational versus academic, or university versus nonuniversity), entering age requirements, or program duration. It does, however, operationalize the concept of level by defining each successive level of education in terms of the previous level, using years in school as the quantifying element. The years in school used for level parameters are the minimum needed in order to categorize levels across the world's educational systems.\" This organization of educational levels leads to the following definitions: Education Preceeding the First Level, usually beginning at age 3, 4, or 5 (sometimes earlier) and lasting from 1 to 3 years. (Level 0 is intended to capture data on preschool education programs.) Education at the First Level, usually beginning at age 5, 6, or 7 and lasting about 5 or 6 years. (Level 1 is intended to capture data on primary education programs and basic literacy programs.) Education at the Second Level, First Stage, usually beginning at age 11 or 12 and lasting for about 3 years. (Level 2 is intended to capture data on lower secondary education programs, functional literacy programs, and basic vocational programs for school leavers.) Education at the Second Level, Second Stage, usually beginning at age 14 or 15 and lasting for about 3 years. (Level 3 is intended to capture data on upper secondary education programs, secondary equivalence programs for adults, and vocational programs leading to secondary school graduation.) Education at the Third Level, First Stage, of the Type that Leads to an Award Not Equivalent to a First University Degree, usually beginning at about age 17 or 18 and lasting for about 3 years. (Level 5 is intended to capture data on short postsecondary education programs and postsecondary occupational programs not leading to full degrees.) Education at the Third Level, First Stage, of the Type that Leads to a First University Degree or Equivalent, usually beginning at about age 17 or 18 and lasting for about 4 years. (Level 6 is intended to capture data on full first, or undergraduate, postsecondary degree programs and equivalent programs.) Education at the Third Level, Second Stage, of the Type that Leads to a Posigraduate University Degree or Equivalent, usually beginning at about age 21 and lasting for an indeterminant number of years. (Level 7 is intended to capture data on postsecondary degree programs and equivalent programs occuring subsequent to the award of a first degree or equivalent.) Education Not Definable by Level. (Level 9 is intended to capture data on educational programs outside the formal sequence of education levels, including programs leading to no recognized award and carrying no credit.)\" ISCED levels are listed in a broken numerical sequence because levels 4 and 8 have never been assigned. They are reserved for possible revision of the ISCED system, but to date have not yet been implemented. The current structure of educational levels as defined in the ISCED system is readily adaptable to the SED comparative database.'"}, {"section_title": "Using ISCED to Distinguish Secondary and Postsecondary Education", "text": "Defining postsecondary education involves distingushing this level and kind of education from that which precedes it: secondary education. The point at which secondary school completion is deemed to occur, and postsecondary education thus begins, varies among educational systems and within them according to the type of secondary studies that an individual student pursues. Someone seeking to define the point of secondary/ postsecondary interface is thus faced with a variety of practices and policies that often contradict one another and cannot be reconciled for purposes of statistical research. For this reason, it is impossible to arbitrarily define secondary completion based on the official regulations or customary patterns of one country, or one type of secondary program. Some examples of national variations may illustrate the problem. U.S. secondary education generally ends at the conclusion of the 12th year of formal schooling with a diploma that roughly corresponds to a general course of secondary studies in Europe and Japan, but not to the level of education reached by students enrolled in those countries' university preparatory or advanced school-to-work transition programs.' A U.S. high school diploma may be compared, for example, to completing Realschule in Germany or Fifth Form studies in Great Britain (10th and 11th grades, respectively). By contrast, the. German Abitur and the English Sixth Form qualification represent levels of secondary education that typically receive advanced college-level credit (up to junior standing, or 2 years of U.S. college-level studies) when holders of such credentials enroll in U.S. colleges and universities.\" 35 While many U.S. public school systems provide a preschool or kindergarten program, and some also provide a nursery school or prekindergarten program, these programs are elective and not always available. Thus, while data on enrollments in various preschool programs are collected these levels are not counted as part of the regular sequence of 12 years of elementary and secondary education. Likewise, advanced vocational training programs in some countries are not always considered postsecondary education there, yet these programs extend beyond 12 years of school and definitely provide preparation not available in regular secondary programs. (German Berufsakademien and Swiss and Finnish higher vocational education are examples of this phenomenon)\" A third complication is represented by professional programs that are recognized as postsecondary and that may require similar entrance qualifications as universities, but that are not considered university-level education. German Fachhochschulen and the pre-1991 British Polytechnics (among others) fit this hybrid model.' Yet a fourth example of a variation is the classes preparatoires for the French Grandes Ecoles, which are offered in secondary lycees but provide a postsecondary level of education equivalent to 1 or 2 years of French university studies.\" What is clearly needed is an operational definition of the secondary/postsecondary transition point that allows all national patterns to be expressed via the same formula. This definition should, if possible, be one that is (a) widely recognized and used by researchers and policymakers; and (b) officially recognized by governments and educational authorities as satisfactory for data reporting purposes. Using the ISCED definitions of secondary and postsecondary education solves these problems and avoids the technical and policy-related problems that would occur if an attempt were made to arbitrarily construct a system of educational level definitions. While using ISCED helps to resolve the issues of universality and official sanction, it does not resolve the problem presented by the fact that individual respondents' educational experiences do not always fit any standard pattern. However, no coding system developed for a large survey-based database could do this without defeating its purpose. The aim of SED is to provide data on aggregate activity and trends, not to analyze the personal development of individuals. Indeed, the regulations governing SED and the laws of the United States prohibit any individualized data reporting or analysis. A coding system for degree awards is necessary in order to handle the data on educational backgrounds in the SED database, and this system must be able to do so in generalizable and comparable ways. Given this requirement, an ISCED-based set of definitions and implementation systems is preferable to other alternatives."}, {"section_title": "Defining Secondary Education", "text": "Using the ISCED operational definition of the point of transition between secondary education, (ISCED level 3) and the beginning of postsecondary education (starting at ISCED level 5), a regular secondary school program may be defined as a program that begins around 14-15 years of age and normally lasts until age 17 or 18, representing when completed approximately 12 years of formal schooling counting previous primary (elementary) education.\" Secondary school completion is thus defined by years of age and years in school, not by type of program as officially recognized. Since some secondary programs take longer to complete than others (especially university preparatory programs), while others take less time (such as some vocational programs or compulsory schooling), a definition based on program content or type would be impossible to apply consistently across different educational systems or even within some systems. The definition adopted has the advantage of being applicable to all systems of education.\" The term \"approximately\" in the definition of secondary education refers to the fact that completed secondary school programs represent between 9 and 13 years of schooling, depending on the country and the program. For SED research purposes, however, the approximation is not nearly so loose. All secondary school awards which do not permit their holders to enroll in postsecondary studies may be ignored, since individuals qualifying for the research doctorate would not usually hold such credentials. A perusal of secondary  Within-country variations are not reflected when national data are crosswalked to ISCED or a system based upon it. These suppressed variations are not a severe problem when the object of research is not to determine bilateral equivalency, but rather to analyze educational backgrounds using a common system. Furthermore, the research doctorate level of education is comparable across all national education systems awarding it, unlike other levels. The research doctorate in the case of the SED is the U.S. Ph.D. degree, thus representing a common completion point for all respondents. Furthermore, within-country variations in educational progression most frequently occur at the point of transition from secondary to postsecondary education and at the undergraduate (first degree) level, less so at higher levels. school completion qualifications around the world demonstrates that, universally, secondary programs that qualify individuals for postsecondary study consist of one of three basic types: (1) Specific academic preparatory programs leading to a university or college entrance diploma or the right to take an entrance examination; (2) Vocational/technical programs leading to a diploma or examination allowing the student to enter specific postsecondary programs of study at the university or college level; and 3General secondary school programs that qualify completers to apply for admission to universities and colleges, or to take entrance examinations.\" Secondary awards of these types are also similar in length from country to country, the range of variation being 11 to 13 years of formal schooling (nearly always including more years than required by compulsory attendance laws). This similarity permits an operational definition of the term \"approximate\" by the creation of three secondary level codes, based on ISCED level 3: Special Operational Cases. In certain cases it is common practice at U.S. postsecondary institutions to treat secondary credentials that represent less than 12 years of school as regular secondary awards, and in other cases to award advanced placement credit for secondary awards representing 12 or more years of school. A few well-known examples of such cases include Brazilian academic secondary awards and British Fifth Form qualifications, which represent 11 years of cumulative education but are commonly treated as comparable to U.S. 12-year high school-diplomas; the French baccalaure at, representing 12 years of cumulative education but commonly recognized as representing up to a year of advanced placement credit in U.S. institutions; and the German Abitur, a secondary award representing 13 years of cumulative education but frequently recognized for up to 2 years of advanced placement credit (junior standing) in U.S. institutions. Secondary programs and awards such as these are accomodated in CDS by assigning them to the secondary code corresponding to prevailing U.S. practice. This inconsistency within the system is justified in order to insure that time-to-degree data for foreign students in U.S. postsecondary programs are accurately measured. To treat a qualification such as an Abitur as a 12-year U.S. high school diploma, for example, would ignore the vital difference in how postsecondary institutions view the two qualifications, and thus distort any time-todegree calculations made on that basis and the conclusions drawn therefrom. These special cases are allowed for in the operational definitions and formulae for secondary ai,c1 postsecondary education. They present no technical problems in terms of the coding system, but users should be alert to them. SED is a census of students admitted to U.S. postsecondary institutions, so it is important for the SED coding system to incorporate common evaluation and placement practices for foreign awards whenever these exist.\" The listing of completion awards and corresponding CDS codes for each country in Volume 2 incorporates r.is special case rule and helps to clarify how the coding system operationally defines degree sequences in the case of each country."}, {"section_title": "Distinguishing Postsecondary from Secondary Education", "text": "These quantitative definitions of secondary completion points, based firmly on the basic ISCED definition, permit the following definition of postsecondary education as programs of education longer in duration than ISCED level 3 regular secondary school programs of studies, taking into account the formula for calculating program length based upon the type of secondary program. Therefore, if a short secondary award (as defined above) precedes a postsecondary credential, one or more years is subtracted from the time-to-degree of the initial and all subsequent postsecondary awards for purposes of calculating the years of cumulative education. If an Advanced Secondary Award precedes a postsecondary credential, one or more years is added to the time-to-degree calculation. For Regular Secondary Awards the calculation remains unchanged.

CDS codes 60 and 61, as well as some postsecondary programs and awards assigned to code 70, represent a sequence of program length extending beyond codes 50 and 51. These codes, as implied by ISCED level 6, also happen to correspond to the placement of most first postsecondary degrees. Code 60 includes some 3-year first degrees, such as certain British and Commonwealth bachelor's degrees, which follow secondary awards assigned to level code 32 (in this case because the prerequisite secondary attainment is the 13-year Sixth Form qualification). In addition, code 70 includes some degrees, diplomas, and certificates which are earned after an initial first degree but which are not considered graduate degrees. Examples include U.S. and first-professional degrees in law, medicine, and other fields; certain British and Commonwealth professional degrees in law, medicine, and theology; and diplomas and certificates earned in a year or less after a first degree that provide extra preparation (such as a qualification to teach) but are not full graduate degrees. Graduate Postsecondary Awards. Graduate-level programs and awards, also called second degrees, require a year or more of full-time study or the equivalent after the first or second undergraduate degree. Such awards signify the completion of programs that may include significant independent research and that in all cases represent advanced study in a subject beyond the undergraduate or entry level.

A 2-year Level 5 breakout is preferred to a 3-year breakout because most known programs at this'level are of 1, 2, or 3 years duration all of which would be lumped together if a 3-year cut were employed. Where longer programs of this kind exist, such as some 4-or 5-year programs, the question arises as to whether such cases need to be assigned to subcode 51 or be placed at Level 6. The decision is based on the subcode operational definition which the program or degree in question matches.

Nor should these codes be interpreted to indicate the level of educational attainment, in terms of subject mastery and demonstrable skills, that any particular graduate of a specific institution or program thus coded might be expected to possess. Furthermore, level subcodes are not designed or intended as degree equivalency indicators. Expressing academic levels in terms of ISCED does not permit direct comparisons between national programs and awards, for ISCED does not match any specific national system of postsecondary education. This subcode permits analysis of earned credentials in terms of an internationally accepted level structure while avoiding the complications and hazards of attempting direct comparisons of national awards. The coding structure for degree levels is described in Chapters 3 and 4, and the codes are presented in Parts 8 and 11 of this volume."}, {"section_title": "Defining Postsecondary Program Types", "text": "The structure of the SED survey instrument and the longitudinal continuity of the SED database do not lend themselves to using the ISCED program type classification or others based upon it.\" SED program field codes are based on the U.S. Department of Education's Classification of Instructional Programs and are provided to respondents on the back of the survey instrument.

Postsecondary institutions may be general or specialized in the range of programs which they offer. Some institutions offer a wide variety of programs in academic or professional fields, or both, and may be styled comprehensive institutions. Others offer a narrow variety of programs with a common theme, such as academies of fine or performing arts or engineering institutes, or specialize in a single field, such as schools for primary teacher training or theological seminaries. They may be styled specialized institutions. The name of an institution is not always a good indicator of whether it is in fact comprehensive or specialized. Take the examples of public postsecondary vocational-technical schools and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), both from the United States. The former are in many cases comprehensive community colleges which retain the narrower designation under which some States originally created them, while MIT, which began as an engineering school, now encompasses a variety of programs and is a comprehensive research university. Likewise, some institutions called universities either possess little or no graduate research emphasis, or offer programs in only one or a few related fields. In addition to the variety of programs offered, postsecondary institutions are also distinguished by the level and kind of programs and services offered. In general, institutions may be distinguished based on the degree to which they emphasize advanced research and preparation for advanced studies or careers. Institutions emphasizing short programs that either prepare students for careers or for transfer to longer degree-granting programs may be styled subdegree institutions. Institutions emphasizing education at the first-degree level only may be styled undergraduate institutions. Institutions providing both undergraduate and graduate programs, but which do not emphasize advanced research, may be styled mixed institutions. Institutions providing only graduate-level programs, but which do not emphasize advanced research, may be styled graduate institutions. Institutions emphasizing advanced research, and which typically offer programs leading to the research doctorate, may be styled research institutions. Finally, institutions offering programs that do not lead to degrees, diplomas, or certificates, but which are postsecondary, may be styled special institutions. Institutional type is operationally defined and coded according to a two-place alphanumeric system that takes both program breadth and level of emphasis into account. The first (lefthand) alphabetical code refers to the scope and variety of programs offered by an institution at each of the broad levels described above. These include Comprehensive Undergraduate Institution. A postsecondary institution offering a wide variety of academic and professional programs at the undergraduate (first award) level and possibly the subdegree level, but which does not offer any graduate-level programs. G Specialized Undergraduate Institution. A postsecondary institution offering one or a few programs at the undergraduate (first-award) level and possibly the subdegree level, but which does not offer any graduate-level programs."}, {"section_title": "II", "text": "Comprehensive Subdegree Institution. A postsecondary institution offering a wide variety of academic and professional programs below the level of the first (undergraduate) award, but which offers no programs at first award level or higher. CDS determinations of level and type are keyed to ISCED-based calculations of program length and the nature of the study focusrepresented by a given program (research, professional qualification, instruction). The system does not segregate classes of postsecondary education or institutions by other criteria, such as whether a program or institution is classified as university-level or nonuniversity in a particular country. Consequently, the foregoing typology of research, graduate, undergraduate, and subdegree institutions encompasses all postsecondary institutions. Comprehensive institutions of any type offer such a variety of programs that they cannot be said to emphasize any single field of study or narrow group of fields. There is no need, in such cases, to further specify the programmatic focus of the institution. Other institutions specialize in education in one field or a group of related fields. CDS identifies the nature of such specialization in the second alphabetical code of the two-digit institutional type code.

This custom has resulted in a great variety of regional classifications, no two of which are exactly alike. Some of them were developed to research specific problems such as weather patterns, economic issues, communications links, and biological or ecological analyses and are not always adaptable to other purposes. Others represent divisions based on the interests or convenience of a single country or organization --such as mapping immigration or emigration flow, or investments, or organizational membership and do not represent an arrangement that users in other countries, or outside the organization, would find useful or acceptable. In yet other cases, there is broad agreement on regional concepts but no agreement on the precision of regional boundaries, as indicated by the universal acceptance of terms like \"Northern Europe\" or \"East Asia,\" but considerable controversy over which countries actually belong in each region. (In most cases the answer varies with the purpose and subject of the proposed regional breakout.) For the above reasons, this coding system does not embed regional codes within the country identification code, as the previous system did. Since each country is assigned a code, users of this system are enabled to construct their own regional breakouts as they see fit. A revised set. of regional groupings are used by U.S. government agencies and contractors for analyzing and publishing SED foreign respondents data. These groupings are adapted from the set developed by the Institute for International Education (IIE), a domestic educational organization involved in sponsoring international exchanges and maintaining a database on foreign students who enroll in U.S. postsecondary institutions.\" The IIE regional breakout is modified for SED purposes by the addition of countries not contained in the IIE listing and by accommodating the breakup of the former Czechoslovakia, Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia, and the unification of Germany.

Common usage treats the concept of a country the same as that of a sovereign state, but this is an inadequate analogy for a system that must contain isolable data on a variety of internationally recognized places of origin, residence, citizenship, and location. To accommodate the legitimate needs of researchers and data users, and the requirement of recognizing distinct macrosocial units for comparative purposes, CIDS uses the following conventions to operationally define a \"country:\" a sovereign political entity occupying territory and containing a resident population of persons; an extraterritorial dependency of a sovereign political entity for which data are commonly reported separately from the sovereign's; and an internationally recognized population which possesses special status but does not constitute a territorial entity. The first operational convention, all sovereign nation-states, is self-evident. The second refers to a group of places that are not independent states (although they may be internally self-governing) but are nevertheless distinct societies whose data are generally reported under their own entries in references, which are located outside of the boundaries of the parent country (or are nonadjacent, if the parent is insular), and which may frequently constitute legitimate objects of separate study. Examples would include Puerto Rico, French Polynesia, Gibraltar, and Greenland. Nonsovereign entities located within the boundaries of or adjacent to the parent country are listed as subunits of that country. An example would be the Channel Islands, which are British dependencies located between the United Kingdom and France, and therefore adjacent to the parent country. The final category of place defined as a country is used to record data about populations and representative national organizations which possess international political and legal recognition but are neither territorially sovereign nor territorial dependencies of another state. Examples of such special status entities include Palestine and the Palestinian population, the Romani (granted special recognition by the European Union), and the Kurdish population. Individuals belonging to such populations and entities will frequently indicate it as the place of location, origin, residence, or citizenship, and institutions may identify themselves as being affiliated with such entities. These situations must be accommodated in the database system in order to avoid error. Country codes may be used to describe the place of an individual student or staff member respondent's residency, citizenship, and birth, as well as the location of specific institutions. Such responses may include nonsovereign places, denoting territories, colonies, or even nationalities (especially in the case of stateless persons and institutions serving them), in addition to sovereign states. The coding system must reflect such realities. Furthermore, there is the need to reduce the effects of international political changes on data quality, and this is best accomplished by assigning country subcodes to all territorial entities that are commonly acknowledged and included in international data reporting. Section 2 of this volume presents a list of all country codes assigned in this system. The absence of a separate country subcode assignment for a particular entity, or the presence of such a subcode, is not meant to in any way imply recognition or nonrecognition by the United States, or to constitute interference in the internal or external affairs of any state. These subcode assignments merely follow the accepted data reporting practices of public and private researchers and organizations concerned with international and comparative statistics."}, {"section_title": "Defining a Country Subdivision", "text": "Many countries included in the coding system possess internal subdivisionssuch as states, provinces, or territoriesthat are commonly used for data reporting purposes. CDS provides the capability of analyzing international data by country subdivision in those cases where such a breakout is warranted. Special quantitative and qualitative criteria have been developed to determine when it is appropriate or necessary to do this. Countries Defining Large Data Subsets. Country origin or location is a variable which, like any other in survey research, is subject to varied degrees of statistical manipulation based upon the size of the response for that variable data item. If the response and consequent data count are large enough over time, then data for a particular country may be broken out and analyzed by subdivision. The first criterion for doing a subdivision breakout, therefore, is the size of the data subset for a particular country. The minimum threshold for breakout eligibility in CDS has been determined to be when the U.S. doctorate productivity for a country meets or exceeds a rounded average of 50 earned U.S. doctorates per year over the decade 1980-1989. Countries meeting this productivity threshold criterion include\": Research Council, 1990, Appendix B, Table 3: \"Country of Origin of Non-U.S. Citizen Doctorate Recipients, 1960Recipients, -1989 5.3 To accornodate the historical change that continues to occur in the pattern of donor countries, the threshold productivity criterion is also applied to countries of origin that respondents have increasingly indicated in recent years (within the last decade) and whose count of U.S. doctorate recipients currently exceeds 50 per year. The countries m..,:ting this application of the criterion include:\" A total of 32 donor countries meet the threshold criterion. Meeting this criterion is critical for making a subdivision breakout technically possible, but it is not the sole consideration. Additional Justifications for Subdivision Breakouts. CDS assigns subdivision codes to a country when data for it meet the quantitative threshold criterion and when The national postsecondary educational system is large and complex enough to justify organization by subdivision in the database; Internal divisions of the country serve as the common official levels of aggregation and disaggregation for data collection, reporting, and publishing; Internal divisions of the country possess different local educational systems or \" DRF/OSEP/NRC, Non-11.S. Citizen Doctorate Recipients, Appendix B,  (Washington: National Academy Press, 1991), pp. 11 (1990 and 5 (1991). structure:, or represent culturally distinct areas; and Ongoing political developments create a need to organize country data by subdivision in order to reflect the possibility or reality of separations, partitions, or breakup. Size and Complexity of the National Education System. Many countries which meet the threshold requirement for subdivision breakout also tend to be countries whose national systems of postsecondary education contain so many institutions that a regional breakout is needed in order to assign codes to each institution and allow for future changes and additions. The limitations of the code string (a 26-letter Roman alphabet and 10 Arabic numerals) justify such treatment in the case of Brazil (over 800 postsecondary institutions), China (over 1,000 postsecondary institutions), France (over 500 postsecondary institutions), Germany (ov3r 400 postsecondary institutions), India (over 3,000 postsecondary institutions), Indonesia (over 400 postsecondary institutions), Iran (over 200 postsecondary institutions), Japan (over 300 postsecondary institutions), Mexico (over 300 postsecondary institutions), the Philippines (over 900 postsecondary institutions), South Korea (over 200 postsecondary institutions), Russia (over 600 postsecondary institutions), the United Kingdom (over 500 postsecondary institutions), and the United States (over 3,500 postsecondary institutions). In addition to raw numbers, the postsecondary educational systems of each country mentioned comprise a wide variety of types of institutions and programs.' The issue in regard to these systems is not that students come to the United States from every one of the institutions within them, but rather that the institutions from which students may come cannot be predicted with any certainty. Thus it is justifiable to include all potential institutions in the database. Confederations, Federations, and Related Political Structures. Countries possessing confederal or federal systems of government, or which possess other constitutionally recognized internal divisions (such as a monarchical union of several states), generally employ such subdivisions as the basic level for collecting and reporting data and for disaggregating published national data. National data comprise aggregations of these subdivisional data sets, and the subdivisional data are frequently reported or published as part of national and international activities. Examples of federal or confederal arrangements among the countries meeting the threshold criterion include Australia, Canada, Brazil, Germany, India, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, the Philippines (with states clustered into official regions), Russia (new constitution), and the United States. In addition, data for two OECD member states which are federations, and for one confederation, need to be broken out even though reported data do not meet the threshold criterion. These are Austria (a federal republic, Belgium (a federal monarchy), and Switzerland (a confederation).

Taylor, ed., International Handbook of Universities, Twelfth Edition (Paris: International Association of Universities, 1991), printed in North America by the Stockton Press; and Eileen A. Archer, ed., The Commonwealth Universities Yearbook (London: Association of Commonwealth Universities, 1992); and various country-specific publications and unpublished lists. Refer to the References Section of this volume for lists of country-specific material consulted. contains states or cantons representing different regional cultures and sometimes separate education systems, languages, and ethnic groups. Countries possessing nonfederal political systems can also justify data breakout, especially where the threshold criterion is also met. The United Kingdom, which meets the threshold criterion, is a united constitutional monarchy whose subdivisions represent distinct societies and three different educational systems (England and Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland). Educational data for it are regularly broken out by subdivision. France and Spain are not federations but both have recently been reorganized internally along regional lines that reflect important cultural divisions, and these new regions are becoming the basis for planning and data reporting in several areas including education. Thailand also uses regional subdivisions for reporting educational data, with each region consisting of a cluster of several provinces. Other examples of threshold-meeting countries whose size and internal complexities justify such breakouts include Argentina, China, Indonesia, Italy, and Venezuela. While not federal in constitutional structure, each of these countries frequently reports data disaggregated by province or other internal unit, and these subdivisions reflect significant internal differences of an economic, sociocultural, and even political character. Internal Conditions Presenting Special Cases. Internal situations may require data breakout for a few countries that do not meet any other criteria. Cyprus, for example, is currently under a United Nations-monitored cease-fire arrangement separating a predominantly Greek section controlled by the internationally recognized government of the Republic of Cyprus from a predominantly Turkish section occupied by Turkish forces and possessing a government recognized only by Turkey. Each of these governments operates its own educational system. Data for Cyprus as a whole are meaningless unless a means exists for separating Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot data. Another example is the former Yugoslavia. The current Yugoslav Federation consists of Serbia, its current ally Montenegro, and two regions of former Yugoslavia still controlled by Serbia (Kosovo and Vojvodina,. Other components of what was Yugoslavia have broken away and are now treated as sovereign states. This political situation is subject to further possible change. CDS needs to accommodate that reality by breaking out reported data for this remnant of the former Yugoslavia. South Africa is also undergoing fundamental political transformation as well, and possesses distinct internal regions and populations, not to mention that its historical data represent distinct internal separations created during the period of apartheid. The complex issues of nationality, residence, and jurisdictional location in regard to. the Israeli-occupied areas of the West Bank and Gaza require the breakout of Israeli and Jordanian country data in addition to, as previously mentioned, the creation of a Palestine country code. Eligible Countries Not Requiring Subdivisional Breakout. Some countries that meet the data threshold criterion do not require subdivisional breakout. Place locations that constitute single urban areas are not subdivided in this database system regardless of their 46 political status; thus Hong Kong is not assigned subdivision codes. Furthermore, Hong Kong is reverting to China in 1999 when it may become a fourth municipality with provincial status (after Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin). In other cases internal breakout data are provided by place location better than by subdivision. Examples include countries like Egypt and Saudi Arabia, where geographic conditions mean that the population of even rather large governorates (Egypt) or districts (Saudi Arabia) resides mainly or exclusively in specific towns and cities rather than being distributed across the territorial jurisdiction. Educational institutions are likewise located in these population centers rather than in smaller cities, towns, or rural areas. A subdivision breakout for data from countries with the geography of Egypt or Saudi Arabia would not improve data quality or analytical precision. Identification of the place location for a student, institution, or program is sufficient to also identify subdivision. Other cases in which subdivisional breakout is neither necessary nor useful, despite meeting the data threshold requirement, include Greece, Sri Lanka, and Turkey. Eachof these cases either sends too few U.S. doctorate recipients annually to be broken out by the relatively large number of internal subdivisions used or does not commonly use a subdivisional breakout in data reporting. (Turkey, for example, has 68 provinces and no recognized official means of aggregating these into a smaller number of clusters, while producing an average of 85 U.S. doctorates a year.) Based on the reasoning stated above, country subdivision breakouts are used in CDS for the following countries: Section Two of this volume presents the country subdivision codes used in CDS for each of the countries listed above. The absence of a country subdivision breakout, or its presence for a given country, is not meant to in any way constitute a judgement by the United States about the internal affairs of any state. In all cases of subdivision breakouts, the listed subdivisions are those recognized by the government of the state concerned and regularly used in data reporting. It should be noted again, however, that extraterritorial dependencies are assigned separate country codes in this data system, in order to allow researchers the option of either treating these societies (often exhibiting distinct differences from that of the home country) as elements of the parent country or as objects of study in their own right. Such assignments are based on common research usage, and do not in any way imply a political judgement. Users desiring to aggregate all data about a given sovereign state, including dependencies, can do so in the same way that regional aggregations can be constructed."}, {"section_title": "Defining a Place", "text": "All data pertaining to location is ultimately focused on some specific point within a country, generally a city, town, village, or rural address. Such a point, in the SED coding system, is called a place location. Place is used to locate both individuals (in terms of residence) and the institutions they have attended and are attending. The almost infinite variety of place locations makes assigning codes to every potential place impossible. Instead, places are assigned codes only as they are indicated by respondents and for the addresses of known postsecondary institutions. For countries which are broken into subdivisions, places are assigned codes by subdivision. Thus, places in Wales a United Kingdom subdivision are numbered (that is, coded) in one sequence, while places in other United Kingdom subdivisions (England, Man, Northern Ireland, Scotland) are numbered in separate sequences. Countries without subdivision codes have all reported places numbered in a single sequence. Also, single large urban areas (such as Hong Kong, New York, Paris, Singapore, Tokyo, Mexico City, and others) are assigned a single place subcode, and are not broken up into separately coded districts or other subunits. (As the illustrations suggest, this is true whether they are independent citystates or internal jurisdictions.) In all cases, place numbering occurs in the order in which place locations are reported and recorded by coders. These solutions satisfy the need to accommodate diversity of place location without creating the sort of excessive detail that would threaten the capacity of the data system as well as be of questionable utility. The absence of a place subcode, or its presence for a given entity, is not meant to in any way constitute a judgement by the United States about the internal affairs of any state. In all cases of place assignment, the listed places are only those which are recognized by the government of the state concerned as a bona fide urban/metropolitan area, city, town, village, or rural address point. Section 2 of this volume presents a complete list of all place codes assigned in this system for reporting institutional data."}, {"section_title": "Defining Primary Language of Instruction", "text": "Each postsecondary institution delivers instruction, accepts research papers, and conducts examinations in one or more languages. While multiple languages may be accepted by the institution or specific faculties in certain cases, such as research papers or examinations (especially in cultural and linguistic studies), in practice one or two languages are usually recognized as institutional vernaculars. And, where more than one such language are used, one generally takes priority and is the most common. The primary language of instruction used by an institution, then, may be defined as the official language of instruction or, where more than one exist, the predominant language used by faculty and institutional officers for instructional purposes and reported as such. \"Predominant,\" in this usage, means the language listed first by institutions reporting their official languages of instruction. Identification of the primary language of instruction is facilitated by periodic reports made by the institutions themselves to international organizations such as the IAU and the Commonwealth Universities Council (CUC). CDS adapts the IAU/TRACE list of known primary languages of instruction for use in coding this variable.\" A primary language of instruction is usually, but not necessarily, the same as the official language of the country within which an institution is located. The primary language of instruction may instead be one of several official or popular languages, the language of a former imperial power retained as a vernacular, or some other language adopted for special reasons. Data on the primary language of instruction of each institution at which an SED respondent has studied may shed light on the linguistic capabilities of foreign graduate students in the United States, particularly those languages which have been used for postsecondary study. Such languages may differ from both the respondent's native language and the official language of his or her country of citizenship or residence. The data thus obtained enable identification of languages which individual respondents have had to use in completing academic programs, and in which they may therefore be expected to be fluent for academic purposes. A presentation of the primary language of instruction subcodes assigned in CDS appears in Section 2 of this volume. \" TRACE User Manual, Annex 2: \"Language Codes,\" pp. 24-26."}, {"section_title": "49", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "P5", "text": "CHAPTER 4 Implementing CDS The Survey of Earned Doctorates collects individual respondent data pertaining to geography, academics, and future plans. These data are obtained from the following SED questionnaire items: Responses to these items are coded using the following parts of the Place Code, Country Subdivision Code (where applicable), and Country Code (Regional Grouping also applicable) All of the codes listed here have been operationally defined in Chapter 2, and they are presented in Part 2 of this Volume and in Volumes 2 and 3. Regional Groupings. CDS does not employ specific codes for regional groupings of countries. Individuals or organizations wishing to create regional groupings for different purposes may create them by software sort commands or by hand. Country Codes. Each country, as defined in Chapter 2, is assigned a two-character code consisting of letters of the version of the Roman alphabet used in writing standard English. A typical country code entry looks like this:"}, {"section_title": "KW KUWAIT", "text": "If a country is a dependency, its name will be followed, in brackets, by the italicized name of the sovereign, thus: And, if a country is known by an alternative name that might be used by a respondent, it will be indicated, in ellipses, after the standard or official name: Country code YY is reserved for other responses, and code ZZ is reserved for unknown cases and nonresponses. The two-character country code permits the assignment of up to 676 unique country codes, far more than are required at present or that are likely to be needed in the foreseeable future. Where possible, this system uses the same alphabetic country codes that are assigned in the IAU/TRACE coding system.\" \" IAU/TRACE, User Manual, Annex 1: Country Codes, pp. 20-23. Part 3 presents a list of all country subcodes assigned in this system, and includes (where applicable) a crosswalk of this system's country code assignments to/from those used in previous coding systems. Country Subdivision Codes. The country subdivision code, when used, is a two-character code consisting of the Arabic numerals 00 to 99. A typical country subdivision code entry looks like this: Subdivision codes are grouped under the appropriate country code and assigned codes, starting with \"01,\" in the alphabetical order of the subdivision names. Countries assigned subdivision subcodes possess no more than 98 constituent states, provinces, or other major subdivisions, so the two-digit coding solution is satisfactory. The placement of this subcode is always at the beginning of the Variable Data Code, reading from left to right, starting with the seventh character. Users should note that the code \"00\" is reserved and assigned whenever there is no subdivision breakout. The \"98\" code is reserved for other responses and code \"99\" for unknown cases and nonresponses. Place Codes. Unlike country codes, place codes are not assigned to all possible locations as defined in Chapter 2. Place codes are assigned as needed to those local address points (cities, towns, villages, rural points) that respondents indicate. The code consists of a fourdigit numerical string from 0000 to 9999. Places are assigned codes in sequence beginning with 0001. The \"0000\" code is reserved for unknown cases and nonresponses. Place codes look like this:"}, {"section_title": "Kabul", "text": "The example above is from Afghanistan, a country which is not broken out by subdivisions. In the case of countries which are subdivided, the treatment is the same except that places are numbered from 0001 to 9998 for each subdivision. Code 9999 is assigned to place responses other than those known to be located within a given country or subdivision, while code 0000 is assigned to unknown cases and nonresponses. In order to avoid duplication error, place codes are always used in conjunction with the appropriate country and country subdivision codes. In all cases, large urban areas (such as New York, Paris, Tokyo, Mexico City, and others) are assigned a single place subcode, and are not broken up into separately coded districts or other subunits. Respondents are not asked to indicate within-city locations and are not likely to do so, nor would such detail be practical or cost effective. Program Completion Award Codes. Program completion award data are requested in Item 13 of the SED survey instrument. These data are coded using the education level codes defined in Chapter 2, consisting of a series of two-digit strings in which the first (left-hand) number refers to the ISCED educational level and the second (right-hand) number to the specific sublevel of the award. A typical completion award code looks like this: Juris Doctor / Bachelor of Laws (JD, LLB) / [Law] The code indicates that this is a degree which requires six or more years to complete (seven in this case); that it is not considered a graduate (second) degree but rather a first degree (in this case a second first degree); and indicates its title and any alternative, title abbreviation, and the subject studied in order to earn the degree (in this case professional). When a program completion award code is used in a code string to indicate institutional level (highest award granted), the same 2-digit code appears at the end of the code string for the institution in question. Each known postsecondary award is assigned a program completion award code, and these are presented by country in Volume 2. Not all countries possess postsecondary education systems of their own, and thus degrees structures. Users are reminded that the assignment of these codes is based upon the level of education represented by secondary school completion as defined an discussed in Chapter 2. Two decision rules have also been adopted to deal with program completion awards coding. In counting required time in years necessary to earn a specific award (one step in the code assignment process), the minimum time as reported by the institutions awarding the credential is the figure used. This is the standard practice followed in institutional and national reports on postsecondary degree structures that are submitted to international organizations. Respondents to SED who write in a U.S. degree title or abbreviation (A.A./A.S., B.A./B.S., M.A./M.S., Ph.D., etc.) rather than the actual title or abbreviation of the degree they earned at a non-U.S. institution will be coded according to the ISCED/institutional level subcode to which that particular U.S. degree award is assigned. Program Type Codes. SED employs a standard set of field codes for respondents' use in indicating both the field of studies of previous degree programs and the field of study for the U.S. doctorate. The field codes are attached to the questionnaire in an appendix called the Specialties List, which groups the fields by broad subject matter area. A typical field code consists of a three-digit numerical string, thus: 420"}, {"section_title": "Applied Mathematics", "text": "The first (left-hand) number refers to the broad subject matter area, while the remaining digits identify the specific field. There are currently 274 fields with assigned codes, grouped into 25 broad subject matter areas. Code \"999\" is reserved for other and unknown responses. The field codes are linked via crosswalks to the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP), the U.S. government's standard education program classification system. CIP program codes are, in turn, linked via crosswalks to ISCED.\" These linkages enable users to sort and analyze SED program completion data in a variety of ways. A list of current SED program completion codes is presented in Part 2 of this Volume."}, {"section_title": "The Special Case of Institutional Data", "text": "Institutional data are collected via Item 13 in the SED questionnaire, which asks respondents to indicate the previous institutions from which they have received postsecondary degrees. Item 13 is a complex response item consisting of blocks for reporting up to 6 previous institutions, years attended, fields of study, degree titles, and dates awarded. The SED coding system incorporates variable data that are not directly collected into the code string assigned to each institution indicated by respondents. These indirectly collected institutional data include institutional level, type, and primary language of instruction. Indirect institutional data are embedded in the code string of 17 alphanumeric characters forming the code for each postsecondary institution.\" The data to be collected and analyzed via this system are of two types: that which identifies an institution and that which provides specific information about it. Identification data consist of basic information about institutions that are included in the database, including name and location. Specific data include such variable items as institutional type, level, and primary language of instruction used. Readers will recall that this is the institutional code for Alabama A & M University, an institution located in the State of Alabama, United States of America. Each of these codes will be described in turn. Country Code -US. This code is the standard SED country code for the country in which the institution is located. Identifier Number -0001. The identifier number consists of a four-digit string of Arabic numerals from 0001-9998. Alabama A & M is the initial institution located in the United States to be assigned a code, and is thus assigned the number 0001. The combination of the country code and identifier number produces a code string unique to each institution. In the case of the example, Alabama A & M University, that unique code string is US0001. This string is called the Institutional Identification Code and is used by coders to identify the institution. Country Subdivision Code -01. Like the country code, the country subdivision code is the standard SED country subdivision code for the country subdivision in which the institution is located. The code used in this example is for the U.S. subdivision of Alabama. Place Code -0001. Place codes for institutions are also identical to those used for individual respondent data, and indicate the location point of the institution. Since place codes are assigned in the order in which encountered, the example, Alabama A & M University, has a place code of 0001 to indicate that the town in which it is located Normal, Alabama is the first place assigned a code in the first subdivision (Alabama) of the country (United States). tl Primary Language of Instruction Subcode -EN. Immediately following the place code is a two-character Primary Language of Instruction Code consisting of two letters of the Roman alphabet from A to Z. These letters together coraprise a code from AA to ZZ that identifies the primary language used by the institution concerned in its instructional activities. Where an institution uses more than one language in instruction, the code identifies the language that is considered to be tic main one and listed first by the institution itself. Code ZZ is reserved for institutions where the primary language of instruction is unknown. A typical code, when presented, looks like this:"}, {"section_title": "EN English", "text": "EN happens also to be the primary language of instruction code for the institutional code example, Alabama A & M University. Primary Language of Instruction Codes follow those used by the IAU/TRACE system.\" Since the number of such languages in use is limited (far fewer, for example, than the number of recognized languages), the number of codes for this variable does not exceed the number of possible subcode assignments (676). Institutional Type Code -AA. .Institutional type is recorded by means of a two-character subcode consisting of letters of the Roman alphabet from A to Z located immediately following the primary language of instruction subcode. The institutional type codes used in this coding system have been defined and described in Chapter 2. In this example the first, or lefthand, letter A means that Alabama A&M University is a comprehensive research institution offering the research doctorate degree, and the second or righthand letter indicates the same (a comprehensive institution cannot simultaneously be specialized). Institutional type codes are not assigned except within the institutional code string. Section 2, Part 9 presents a complete list of all institutional type codes assigned in this system. Institutional Level Code -73. The final characters in the institutional code string consist of a two-digit numerical code which indicates the level of the highest degree awarded by the institution. This code is identical to the program completion code described in Chapter 3 and based on the education level code sequence defined in Chapter 2. In this case the code number 73 indicates that Alabama A&M University awards the research doctorate. Note that regarding institutional award data, this code refers only to the highest degree that a given institution awards. Many 'institutions award credentials at lower levels as well, so that this data element often indicates the highest limit of a range of awards rather than the sole award made. Volume 2 presents a complete list of all program completion award codes assigned in CDS, which are also used as institutional level codes. Volume 3 presents a complete list of all known postsecondary institutions by country, listed by institutional code.
