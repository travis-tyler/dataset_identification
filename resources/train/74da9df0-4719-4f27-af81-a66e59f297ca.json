[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The variance of skill levels across U.S. labor markets is large. Table 1 shows the labor markets with the highest and lowest percent residents with a college degree in the 2000 Census. The gap between the most educated places like the nation's capital, San Francisco, and Boston and the least educated places like rural Appalachia is remarkable. A recent economics literature suggests that skills generate substantial benefits for local economies. The focus tends to be on the effects of local skill differences rather than how those skill differences arose. For example, Moretti (2004a) argues that an increase in the percent of a city's residents with a college degree increases wages of all its residents, so education has external benefits. 1 Researching another effect, Glaeser and Saiz (2003) show that the percent of a city's residents with a college degree is positively correlated with city population growth throughout the 20th century. They provide evidence that higher-skilled cities experience more productivity growth, and they argue that local skills enable cities to adapt to changing economic environments. Consistent with these findings, local governments in the U.S. attempt to retain and attract skilled workers. An example of their efforts is Georgia's HOPE scholarship, which reduces the cost of attending Georgia colleges for academically successful Georgia high school graduates. Several states have subsequently enacted similar scholarship programs with the explicit goal of retaining local talent. Despite the perceived benefits from local skills, economists know relatively little about the process that determines the observed geographic distribution of skill. In particular, we do not know much about the persistence of skill inequality across labor markets over time or about the mechanisms underlying this persistence. In addition, we do not have a clear sense for what local characteristics predict that a location will have a high or low level of skill. This paper contributes empirical evidence about the geographic distribution of skill in the U.S. and a framework for understanding the determinants of this distribution. Three factors determine the human capital in a local labor market at a point in time: the human capital of the previous generation, the intergenerational transmission of skill from parents in the previous generation to their children, and migration of differently skilled children to adult locations. I assess how intergenerational transmission and migration affect the persistence over time of labor market skill inequality. I also identify labor market characteristics that predict local skill levels. I begin with a statistical decomposition of state differences in skills using the U.S. Census. I use a predicted earnings index to categorize workers into skill categories and take as my local skills measure the local ratio of high-skilled to low-skilled populations. I take the state as the location definition, since this is the least aggregated birth location identified in the Census. For each state, I measure the skills of a parent generation residing in the state, of the next generation born in the state, and of the second generation residing in the state as adults (natives who stayed and in-migrants). I find evidence of mean reversion in state skills through intergeneration transmission; that is, states with the highestand lowest-skilled parents tend to have children with skills closer to the national mean level of skills. Of course, the Census has weaknesses for this exercise. The most important weakness is that states are poor proxies for labor markets, which are the geographic units of interest for understanding local production and consumption. Many states contain several heterogeneous local labor markets (for example, New York), and some labor markets cross state lines (eg, Kansas City). So, analysis at the state level conceals important skill movements across locations, especially between rural and urban labor markets. To remedy this, I use detailed location data for respondents to the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), which is a nationally representative sample of U.S. resident students in the eighth grade in 1988. The NELS:88 also provides richer data on individual skills and provides data on linked parent and child skills. In order to use the relatively small sample size of the NELS:88 to study skill distributions of all U.S. labor markets, I add structure to the local skill decomposition framework. The additional structure is a model that explains the geographic distribution of human capital as the outcome of a dynamic process wherein parents with different skills choose residence locations, they pass skills to their children, and their children choose their own residence locations. The model shows that selective net migration responds to local characteristics that affect the local relative demand and supply for high-and low-skilled residents. Estimating the model for states replicates findings in the Census accounting exercise, which increases confidence in the estimation procedure. I then estimate the model using groups of counties called commuting zones as the labor market definition. The intergenerational transmission mechanism induces regression toward the mean of labor market skills. In contrast, migration of skills toward labor markets with higher parents skills induces a divergence of commuting zone skills. Small and rural labor markets tend to have the lowest skill levels among adults. These small labor markets gain the most skills through intergenerational transmission, but they lose these skill gains as their most-skilled natives leave at the highest rates."}, {"section_title": "Previous literature", "text": "The previous literature informing us about determinants of the geographic distribution of human capital can be divided into two segments. The first is the study of differences in migration behavior of people with different skills. Differences by skill in migration frequencies, purposes, and destinations affect how migration distributes skills across labor markets. The second and smaller segment describes how education levels vary across locations and identifies location characteristics that are correlated with local education levels. The main finding of the first literature segment is that more-skilled people are more geographically mobile than less-skilled people. In his survey of the migration literature, Greenwood (1997) notes this as a robust finding. 2 Relatedly, Bound and Holzer (1992) and Wozniak (2006) provide evidence that college graduates are more likely to move in response to local labor demand shocks than those with less schooling. Malamud and Wozniak (2007) argue that the estimated effect of college education on migration frequency is causal. 3 Another general theme in the literature is that labor market opportunities are more important to higher-skilled migrants than to lower-skilled migrants. Borjas, Bronars, and Trejo (1992) and Dahl (2002) show that higher-skilled individuals tend to sort into labor markets with higher returns to skill. Ham, Li, and Reagan (2006) demonstrate that college graduates who migrate experience wage growth increases, but high school dropouts who migrate experience wage growth decreases. Kodrzycki (2001) uses the NLSY79 to show that recent college graduates tend to move to states with stronger labor markets than their origins. Basker (2003) provides evidence that more-educated migrants are more likely to have a job in hand when migrating than less-educated migrants. A few papers investigate the determinants of local education levels. One determinant is the local education level in a previous year. Berry and Glaeser (2005) and Moretti (2004b) show that MSAs with higher initial proportions of college-educated residents experience more growth in the proportion of college-educated residents between 1970 and 2000. This implies modest divergence of skill levels across MSAs. Bound, Groen, Kezdi, and Turner (2004) study the effect of flows of graduates from state colleges on later stocks of college educated residents and find evidence of a modest positive relationship. Glaeser, Resseger, and Tobio (2008) find evidence that proximity to Latin America, and the corresponding lower cost of immigrating from Latin America, increases an MSA's population of residents with less than high school education."}, {"section_title": "Moretti (2004b) takes a sample of MSAs and regresses the change in percent residents", "text": "with college degrees between 1990 and 2000 on MSA characteristics. He finds the highest growth in northeastern MSAs. The increase in the MSA college share is positively correlated with 1990 college share, population, and percent employment in high-tech jobs. Kodrzycki (2000) is the most similar paper to mine. Kodrzycki studies the differences across Census divisions 4 in percent residents with a college degree. She categorizes regional degree holders into natives who attend local college and stay, migrants who come for college, migrants who come after college, and natives who leave for college but return. Her focus is on New England, and she shows that New England's top rank in education is due mostly to high rates of native college attendance and graduation, rather than migration of college degree holders. The analysis here adds to the literature in several directions. Instead of measuring skill changes from one adult cohort to the next, it decomposes skill changes into the effects of intergenerational transmission and migration mechanisms. A benefit of doing so is the ability to identify whether policies aimed at native skill acquisition or skilled migration have more potential impact on local skills. This analysis also uses commuting zones to define local labor markets in an economically-meaningful way. In doing so, it highlights the contrast between rural and urban labor markets, which is not common in the literature. In addition, the measurement of skill in this paper is more general than in previous analyses, since it aggregates multiple individual characteristics (including schooling) using weights from earnings functions."}, {"section_title": "A statistical decomposition of state differences in skills", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Decomposition of skill supply", "text": "In this section, I decompose the relative supply of skills to a state into three factors: the skill distribution of the previous generation in the state, the intergenerational transmission of skills, and the migration of skills. Let the number of high-skilled adults in location j in generation g be A Hjg and the corresponding low-skilled population be A Ljg . Let the number of high-skilled children in state j in generation g be C Hjg and the corresponding low-skilled population be C Ljg . The number of adults in a state is the sum of the local children who decided to stay and the people from elsewhere who decided to move to the state. That is, for s = L, H. Let P sjkg be the probability that an individual with skill s chooses to migrate from state j to state k, so P sjjg is the probability of staying in j. Then, the number of stayers in j can be expressed as #Stay sjg = C sjg P sjjg for s = L, H. Let the ratio of highto low-skilled adults be S jg = A Hjg /A Ljg and the ratio of high-to low-skilled children be Using these definitions, the relative skill supply to state j is  In the above equation, \u039b jg \u2261 P Hjjg /P Ljjg is the effect of native retention on the skill ratio in j. M jg is a factor that describes the rate of skill increase through in-migration. Taking logarithms of Equation 1 yields Equation 2 decomposes the relative supply of skills to state j into factors due to the skill distribution of the previous generation (S jg\u22121 ), the intergenerational transmission of skill from that generation to the next (K jg /S jg\u22121 ), and the migration of skills (\u039b jg M jg ). I calculate each element of Equation 2 using U.S. Census data. The major benefit from using Census data is that the samples are large. With these data, the location definition is the state, since that is the most disaggregated level of birthplace identification in the Census. I include Washington, D.C. as a state. I use a predicted earnings index to measure skills. I take the full-time workers aged 30 to 40 in the 5 percent 2000 Census sample from IPUMS (Ruggles et al. 2004). With this sample, I estimate a regression of the following form: The dependent variable, y ij , is log weekly labor earnings of individual i who lives in state j. The vector X i includes characteristics of individual i: sex, race, a quadratic in age, and indicators for completed schooling categories. The other regressors are indicators for three-digit occupation (Occ ik ) and indicators for state of residence. The state of residence intercepts capture state differences in wages due to various factors, including cost of living. Using coefficients from OLS estimation of Equation 3, I predict log weekly labor earnings for all workers, setting the state indicator for New York equal to one and all others to zero. I define a worker as high-skilled if his or her predicted earnings fall in the highest quartile of (national) predicted earnings and low-skilled in the lowest quartile. S jg is the ratio of high-skilled to low-skilled populations living in state j as adults in 2000. K jg is the ratio of high-skilled to low-skilled populations born in state j. The idea behind Equation 3 is that productive characteristics are positively correlated with earnings. The measure of local skills (S jg ) is a proxy for expected local earnings, conditional on characteristics of the local population. One benefit of the earnings regression approach is that it provides a weight for each level of schooling attainment, thus quantifying their relative values. In addition, occupations offering higher wages tend to require higher levels of skill. So, I will infer high skills in people in high-earning occupations. Controls for age reflect earnings increasing with work experience. The controls for sex and race are not meant to measure skills directly. However, they have predictive power for earnings and thereby help predict local earnings. To the extent that sex and race are correlated with unobserved labor market productivity, it seems right to control for them in the earnings regressions. 5 The control for sex should not impact the analysis much, since sex ratio does not vary dramatically across locations. Racial proportions vary much more across locations, so the controls for race have a larger effect on the analysis. I calculate S jg\u22121 using a similar earnings prediction index for an earlier cohort: work-ers aged 35 to 45 in the 5 percent 1980 Census sample from IPUMS. I use a regression with   the same form as Equation 3 to predict log weekly earnings for each member of this older   cohort and categorize each member into a quartile of the predicted earnings index. S jg\u22121 is the ratio of high-skilled to low-skilled populations living in state j in 1980. I calculate P sjjg for s = L, H as the fraction of the skill s population born in j who are also living in j in 2000. I then calculate the relative native retention rate for each state: \u039b jg = P Hjjg /P Ljjg . I also calculate the effect of in-migration on the state skill ratio as In order for Equation 3 to predict skills accurately, I assume that the error term ij does not include interactions between occupation and state of residence. If it did, then the earnings prediction would confuse productivity of a worker's state of residence with the worker's own labor market productivity. I expect productivity differentials between occupation categories to vary across states less the more narrowly occupations are defined. I use the most narrow occupation coding available. Previous local skill measures used in the economics literature are average years of schooling and percent residents with a college degree. 6 In the present paper, I adopt a different measure: the ratio of local high-skilled to low-skilled populations, where predicted earnings proxy for individual skill. This measure uses earnings to infer labor market productivity of individual characteristics and thereby captures more variation in skill than schooling measures alone. 7 Referring to skill types (high and low) simplifies exposition somewhat, relative to using a continuous skill measure. Indeed, most economic models of a geographic distribution of people with heterogeneous skills (eg, Berry and Glaeser (2005), Glaeser and Saiz (2003), Moretti (2004a), and this paper) describe skills with discrete types. However, some of the results below use the local average of (continuous) predicted earnings as an alternative, and these results are the same as with the ratio 6 Acemoglu and Angrist (2000) and Rauch (1993) study the impact of local average years of schooling on residents' individual wages. Moretti (2004a) investigates the impact of an MSA's percent college on its residents' own wages. Moretti (2004b) and Berry and Glaeser (2005) investigate trends in percent college residents of MSAs. 7 Glaeser, Resseger, and Tobio (2008) measure human capital with a similar earnings prediction as mine, but their focus is inequality of human capital at the city level. 10 measure. 8 "}, {"section_title": "Results from U.S. state skill accounting exercise", "text": "I find evidence of regression toward the mean of state skills from one generation to the next. This works through intergenerational transmission of skills: states with the highestand lowest-skilled parents tend to have children with skills closer to the national mean level of skills. Across states, migration does not send skills disproportionately to states with higher or lower skills in the previous generation. S jg capture the effects on state skills of in-migration. The fact that \u039b jg is less than one for all states is a dramatic effect of the relationship between individual skill and migration behavior. More-skilled people are more mobile, so out-migrants are more skilled than stayers for all states. The fact that M jg is greater than one for all states shows the same relationship from the opposite perspective. Table 3 lists correlations between parameters to show the average relationships between skill measures of states. The slope coefficient from a regression of ln(S jg ) on ln(S jg\u22121 ) is a measure of generationto-generation persistence in state skills. Similarly, the relationship between parent skills (S jg\u22121 ) and child skills (K jg ) illustrates the role of intergenerational transmission in determining persistence of state skills. Finally, the relationships between previous state skills and measures of skilled migration (\u039b jg and M jg ) illustrate the corresponding role of migration. Table 4 describes these relationships. 9 Each column represents a separate regression where observations are states. 10 Column 1 includes results from regressing a state's skill ratio on the skill ratio of the previous generation in the state. State skill ratios are persistent across generations, although there is some regression toward the mean in skill. The slope coefficient of the regression of log skill ratio on previous generation log skill ratio at the state level is 0.65 with a standard error of 0.14. The R 2 is 0.32, implying that factors other than the previous generation's skills have a large role in determining a state's skill level. 11 The dependent variable in Column 2 of Table 4 is the log state skill ratio of natives of the state. This is equivalent to the skill ratio of adults if intergenerational transmission were the only mechanism affecting the geographic skill distribution. I regress this variable on the natural logarithm of the previous generation's state skill ratio. The slope coefficient of 0.66 is close to the overall slope of 0.65, which implies that intergenerational transmission dominates the relationship between state skills from one generation to the next. 12 This relationship of skills across generations at the location level can be compared to intergenerational transmission of skills within the family. Solon (1999) surveys the literature on the intergenerational transmission of earnings. The consensus estimate of the elasticity of child earnings with respect to parent earnings lies between 0.3 and 0.5 in 10 Since the variables entering the regressions are themselves estimates of population parameters, there is a potential for errors-in-variables bias in OLS estimates. For this reason, I report results in Table 4 that account for sampling error in the dependent and independent variables. Deaton (1985) describes the method. The idea is as follows: Let Y * and X * be dependent and independent variables, respectively, with no sampling error. Let Y and X be the data. Let \u03c3 be the covariance of the additive sampling errors in Y and X and \u03a3 be the covariance matrix of sampling errors in X. Additive sampling error induces additive errors in moment matrices that enter OLS, so E(X X) = E(X * X * ) + \u03a3 and E(X Y ) = E(X * Y * ) + \u03c3. I calculate estimates of \u03a3 and \u03c3, which are functions of skill proportions and Census sample sizes. Then, where N is the number of observations, is a consistent estimate of the vector of slope coefficients. In practice, the results are very similar to those from OLS regressions. 11 An alternative specification takes the state skill measure to be the state average of log earnings predictions, rather than the ratio of skill category populations. Regressing the 2000 state average of log earnings predictions (assigned to adult residence states) on the 1980 state average of log earnings predictions (assigned to adult residence states) yields a slope coefficient estimate of 0.623 with a standard error of 0.126. The R 2 is 0.334. 12 Regressing the 2000 state average of log earnings predictions (assigned to birth states) on the 1980 state average of log earnings predictions (assigned to adult residence states) yields a slope coefficient estimate of 0.632 with a standard error of 0.111. The R 2 is 0.399. the U.S. (page 1780). State skill ratio persistence appears to be higher than family-level intergenerational earnings persistence. Studies of the relationship between parents' schooling and children's schooling are also consistent with family-level persistence and some mean reversion. In cross sections, children's schooling tends to increase less than one-for-one with parents' schooling. This is the case in Behrman and Rosenzweig (2002) with U.S. data and in Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2005) with Norwegian data. 13 The rest of Table 4 describes the relationship between state skills in the previous generation and selective migration. Note that migration is common enough in the U.S. to have a potentially large effect on the distribution of skills across states in one generation. In the 2000 Census sample of workers, 38 percent live in their 30s in states that are not their birth states. Table 4 has as its dependent variable the factor describing the total migration effect on the state skill ratio (\u039b jg M jg ). The near-zero slope coefficient implies that migration does not affect skills differently in states with high-and low-skilled previous generations. 14 Columns Table 4 decompose the effect of migration on state skills into parts due to native retention (\u039b jg ) and in-migration (M jg )."}, {"section_title": "The regression in Column 3 of", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "and 5 of", "text": "The relationship between previous generation skills and the total migration effect on state skills is small, because neither native retention nor in-migration of skills has a strong relationship with previous skills. 13 Much of the recent literature on this topic attempts to decompose the cross-sectional correlation into parts due to genetic and environmental factors. Behrman and Rosenzweig's (2002) identification strategy compares outcomes of twins. Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2005) exploit parental schooling variation due to compulsory schooling law changes. Bj\u00f6rklund, Lindahl, and Plug (2006) and Sacerdote (2007) compare adopted children with non-adopted children. Bj\u00f6rklund, Lindahl, and Plug (2006) use Swedish register data. Sacerdote (2007) collected his own data that describes children adopted from Korea by U.S. families through Holt International Children's Services. 14 Results using state averages of log earnings predictions are similar to these results using the population ratio measure.

Individual i chooses to invest in high skills if U Hij \u2212 U Lij > 0 and chooses low skills otherwise. Let Par Hi be an indicator for child i having high-skilled parents and z j be a vector of characteristics of i's origin location j.

The primary reason is simplicity, both in model exposition and estimation. If children acquire skills because they are anticipating their use of those skills in some labor market other than their origin, then this method will mistakenly identify location characteristics as inducing migration instead of the acquisition of skills. Although the method may mistake the reasons for skill acquisition and migration behavior, the assumed lack of interaction between these two choices does not compromise the predictions of skill stocks and flows tion that gives the skill level of individual i and b(i) be a function that gives the birthplace of individual i. The utility that individual i attains from residing in location k in generation g is whereW s(i)kg is the location k average wage among residents with skill level s and z b(i)kg is a vector of location characteristics. This vector includes interactions between origin and destination characteristics, so individuals from different origins attach different values to destination characteristics. For example, distance between origin and a potential destination is allowed to enter V ikg . Note also the treatment of wages. Average wages enter the utility function, which could be justified by assuming individuals have imperfect information about wages they will be able to earn in any given location. This is unrealistic but perhaps not extreme in this context, where my focus is on estimating average preferences and behavior. Moreover, I constrain the marginal utility of labor earnings (\u03b3) to be the same for both skill levels. The residual \u03be ikg is distributed extreme value independently and identically across i, k, and g. This distribution of the residuals implies that the probability of utility-maximizing individual i locating in k is (letting i's origin be j and i's generation be g) See McFadden (1974). I now aggregate the skill acquisition and migration decisions in order to characterize the relative supply of skills to a labor market. I take notation from the accounting exercise above, so S jg = A Hjg /A Ljg is the relative supply of high-to low-skilled adults of generation g to location j, and P sjkg is the probability that an individual with skill s chooses to migrate from location j to location k.

Overall, model estimation with the NELS:88 has enough precision to replicate findings in the Census, and this adds credibility to the procedure for understanding the geographic distribution of human capital. 26 Following requirements for the use of restricted-access NELS:88 data, I round the number of CZs where NELS:88 respondents lived to the nearest ten. 27 When I include in the analysis predictions for all 741 CZs, outliers handicapped inference about relationships at the CZ level. Evidently, the problem is that estimates for CZs not observed in the NELS:88 sample -but for which I generate model estimates -include too much estimation error. One category of CZs that appears to have relatively poor fit is small college towns. The NELS:88 sample includes some small CZs with relatively high supplies of college services, but they do not cover the highest part of the college supply distribution. In this part of the distribution, the model estimates implausibly high skill gains. I tested the sensitivity of results to changes in the CZ sample composition. Dropping CZs with fewer than 20 NELS:88 respondents did not make much difference. Increasing that threshold to 30 started to change results by dropping small CZs disproportionately. I also used probit models to predict the probability of inclusion into the NELS:88 base year sample with flexible functions of CZ characteristics. Keeping CZs in the NELS:88 sample plus those with relatively high inclusion probabilities yield similar results to those presented here. When I include omitted CZs with NELS:88 inclusion probabilities as low as 0.2, the results begin to change. In particular, the slope coefficients reported in Table 9 become implausibly large due to high levels of estimation error."}, {"section_title": "Model estimation results about the geographic distribution of human capital", "text": "Tables 7 through 11 describe how migration and intergenerational transmission interact with skills of labor markets. The results suggest a recent divergence of local human capital at the CZ level. Intergenerational transmission causes some regression to the mean of skills across CZs, as it does across states. Migration works against this tendency across CZs, unlike across states. That is, migration transfers more skills to CZs that had higher parent skills and thereby causes the skill divergence. Intergenerational transmission transfers skills toward smaller and more rural labor markets, while migration transfers skills toward larger and more urban labor markets. Overall, CZs that gain more skills tend to be larger and to have lower temperatures in January, higher supplies of higher education services, higher taxes on wages, and lower taxes on capital. Table 7 displays descriptive statistics of model estimates for CZs. The variation in skills across CZs is dramatic. Take, for example, the parent generation skill ratios estimated with the 1990 Census. They range from 0.28 to 1.87. Also, the skewness of the distribution of skills across CZs at adult residence (2.26) is higher than the skewness of the child skill distribution (0.81). Migration contributes to skewness in the skill ratio distribution, as a few CZs accumulate high rates of skill. The average of \u039b jg being less than one and the average of M jg being greater than one reflect the fact that movers tend to have more human capital than stayers. Table 8 lists correlations between parameters from the model. The correlation between intergenerational transmission's effect on the skill ratio (K jg /S jg\u22121 ) and pre-existing skill (S jg\u22121 ) is -0.471. This reflects mean reversion in skills through intergenerational transmission. The correlation between the total migration effect on the skill ratio (\u039b jg M jg ) and the parent generation skills (S jg\u22121 ), on the other hand, is positive (0.258). So, migration across CZs tends to work against the mean reversion due to intergenerational transmission. In addition, skills of the previous generation's adults predict skills of the next genera-tion's adults: the correlation between skill ratios S jg\u22121 and S jg is 0.546. The intergenerational transmission effect on skills is negatively correlated with the total migration effect on skills. That is, the correlation between K jg /S jg\u22121 and \u039b jg M jg is -0.25. This is consistent with intergenerational transmission moving skills to smaller labor markets and migration moving skills to larger labor markets, on which I elaborate below. Native retention of skills (\u039b jg ) is negatively correlated with in-migration of skills (M jg ); this correlation is -0.395."}, {"section_title": "Model estimation with the NELS:88 adds extra sampling variation to estimates relying only on Census data. Comparisons between the standard deviation and skewness of S jg\u22121", "text": "and other parameters such as K jg and S jg may be misleading, since S jg\u22121 is estimated with 1990 Census data only. In particular, the standard deviation of S jg\u22121 being lower than the standard deviations of K jg and S jg may be the result of sampling variation rather than an increase in the inequality of skills across CZs over time. In addition, extra variation of a variable that is bounded below by zero, like these ratios, likely induces right skewness. So, I do not emphasize the difference in skewness between the distributions of S jg\u22121 and K jg . I turn next to quantifying the effects of intergenerational transmission and migration on the generation-to-generation persistence of CZ skills. Unlike the state-level analysis, correction for sampling error here makes a large difference in the results. Throughout, I prefer the estimates that correct for bias from sampling error . 28 Column 1 of Table 9 displays results from a regression of the log skill ratio for adults in a CZ on the log skill ratio in that CZ of the previous generation. The slope coefficient is greater than one, so there appears to be some divergence of human capital at the CZ level. This finding is consistent with work by Berry and Glaeser (2005) and Moretti (2004b) at the MSA level. In general, the sampling error correction yields slope estimates further from zero than OLS estimates, as would be the case with classical measurement error. Table 9 has results from a regression where the dependent variable is the log skill ratio among children in the CZ. This is the same as a prediction of what the CZ's adult log skill ratio would be if there were no migration. The independent variable in the regression is the previous generation's log skill ratio. The coefficient estimate is 0.819, indicating that intergenerational transmission contributes to mean reversion in CZ skills."}, {"section_title": "Column 2 of", "text": "Similar to the state level analysis, the degree of human capital persistence at the commuting zone level is greater than previous estimates of human capital persistence at the family level. The literature attempting to identify neighborhood effects has typically not found large effects (see Solon (1999)), and the evidence here is somewhat indirect. However, Column 2 of Table 9 suggests that there exist commuting zone characteristics that affect skill acquisition of children. The analysis below suggests that local higher education may play a role, but identification of causal mechanisms is beyond the scope of this paper. Migration off-sets mean reversion by moving more skills to CZs with higher parents' skills. The regression in Column 3 of Table 9 has as its dependent variable the total effect of migration on the CZ skill ratio (ln(\u039b jg M jg )). The estimated slope is positive, showing that migration works against intergenerational transmission by transferring skills toward CZs with higher skills in the previous generation. Table 9 decompose the migration effect into parts due to native retention of skills and in-migration of skills. The correlation between parent skills (ln(S jg\u22121 )) and native retention of skills (ln(\u039b jg )) is basically zero, which implies that more-skilled and less-skilled CZs tend to lose skills when natives leave about equally. However, the overall relationship between previous generation skills and skilled migration is positive, because more-skilled CZs gain skills at a significantly higher rate through in-migration The next two columns of Table 10 explore separately the two mechanisms underlying the total migration effect on the CZ skill ratio. The dependent variable in Column 3 is the relative native retention rate of skills (ln(\u039b jg )). Major metropolitan areas retain skills at the highest rates, and larger rural labor markets lose the most skills through out-migration."}, {"section_title": "Columns 4 and 5 of", "text": "CZs with more manufacturing activity tend to retain more skills, conditional on other traits. The dependent variable in Column 4 is the effect of in-migration on the CZ skill ratio (ln(M jg )). Small rural CZs experience much less skilled in-migration than major metropolitan areas. Skilled migrants appear to be drawn to colder CZs. More-skilled migrants appear to value college subsidies more than less-skilled migrants. CZs with a higher manufacturing share of industry tend to gain less skill through in-migration.   Table 11 displays results from regressing the natural logarithm of adult (post-migration) skill ratios (ln(S jg )) on CZ characteristics. Adult skill ratios increase in CZ size. In addition, CZs with colder Januaries and more higher education supply tend to have higher skill ratios. CZs in states with lower capital taxes tend to have higher skills. Higher manufacturing shares predict lower skills conditional on other controls."}, {"section_title": "Local characteristics and local skills", "text": "It is clear that larger and more-urban labor markets have higher skill levels among adults than smaller and more-rural labor markets. My findings indicate that migration continually reinforces this difference by sending highly-skilled children from all origins toward cities. Researchers are still refining our understanding of the reasons behind the clustering of highly-skilled people in metropolitan areas. One hypothesis is that cities are productive places where skilled workers meet, exchange ideas, and benefit from each others' productivity. Glaeser (1999)  I find evidence that a positive amenity, average January temperature, is negatively correlated with local skill levels and with skilled migration. This is consistent with a model of location sorting by comparative advantage in which more-productive local labor markets reward high-skilled workers (with higher wages) more than low-skilled workers, while all workers value average January temperature the same. The evidence highlights a trade-off between productivity and amenability of local labor markets. 29 However, it is also consistent with other positive amenities (like museums and restaurants) attracting high-skilled residents. I find that the local supply of college services is positively correlated with the local skill level and also with the effect of migration on local skills. 30 The estimates here assume that college supply factors are exogenous. It is likely, however, that other factors influencing skilled migration are correlated with local college supply. An example is a local industry that both supports local university research and also hires many college graduates from outside the area. So, I cannot infer from this analysis what would be the causal effect of building or expanding a local college on the local skill level. I also find a negative correlation between capital taxation and local skill levels, which may reflect one of several underlying causes. There may be unobserved government services that are correlated with taxation and valued differently by high-skilled and lowskilled people. Alternatively, governments may respond to pre-existing local skill levels (and incomes) when making tax policy. So, I cannot infer a causal effect of taxation on local skills. However, my findings are consistent with research that shows people with high incomes moving away from areas with high taxes (see Bakija and Slemrod (2004) and Feldstein and Wrobel (1998))."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This paper examines the evolution and determinants of local labor market human capi-     Notes: Commuting zones are county groups with strong commuting ties.

The model estimation described above yields estimates for each CZ of the high-and lowskilled populations of a first generation as adults, a second generation as children, those children who stayed in their origins, and the second generation as adults. I sum each of these populations within states to get state populations of high-and low-skilled people. 31 I then take ratios to calculate S jg\u22121 , K jg , K jg \u039b jg , and S jg for each state j. I calculate \u039b jg = (K jg \u039b jg )/K jg and M jg = S jg\u22121 /(K jg \u039b jg ). For this state-level exercise, I use model estimates of all 741 CZs, in contrast to the above analysis of approximately 310 CZs in the NELS:88 sample. Tables C.1 and C.2 show the resulting estimates. Table C.1 displays summary statistics of model estimates describing the distribution of skills across states. These estimates are similar to those from the Census accounting exercise ( Table 2). One difference is that the increase in skewness from child to adult skill distributions comes both through differential native retention and in-migration with the NELS:88, rather than just the former in the Census. The skewness of \u039b jg is negative with the Census but positive in the model estimation. The ranges of \u039b jg and M jg are similar between the two methods, except that the maximum M jg from the NELS:88 method is substantially higher than the maximum from the Census. Table C.2 lists correlations between model components that are comparable to those in Table 3 from the Census accounting exercise. There are some differences, but they seem less notable than the similarities. The largest difference is that the correlation between M jg and K jg /S jg\u22121 changes sign. The main correlations of interest are similar between the two tables. In particular, the correlation between parent skills (S jg\u22121 ) and skill gains through intergenerational transmission K jg /S jg\u22121 is negative and very similar in both specifications. Also, the correlation between S jg\u22121 and skill gains through migration (\u039b jg M jg ) is close to zero. In general, model estimation with the NELS:88 induces more variability in estimates of the geographic mobility of skills than is present in the Census accounting exercise. This is perhaps to be expected, since there is an extra layer of estimation from the model, relative to the Census method, and the underlying sample for measuring migration and intergenerational transmission is smaller than the Census sample. However, the NELS:88 approach has enough precision to replicate findings in the Census and add to the understanding of the geographic distribution of human capital."}]
