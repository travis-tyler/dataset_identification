[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "A central implication of modern growth theory is that long-term economic growth is mainly driven by technological improvements. While certain improvements can be achieved through learning-by-doing (Arrow, 1962;Romer, 1986), most of the innovations we see today are the products of purposeful research and development. Over the past several decades, the U.S. government has adopted various policies to spur R&D investment and economic growth. In this study, we focus on two types of research policies, namely tax incentives for private R&D and government spending on basic research. 1 The goal is to evaluate the e\u00a4ects of these policies on U.S. economic growth and consumer welfare. To achieve this, we develop an endogenous growth model with both public and private research investment. A calibrated version of the model is able to replicate some important features of the U.S. economy over the period 1953-2009. We then perform a series of counterfactual experiments to quantify the impact of research policies on economic growth and consumer welfare. The e\u00a4ect of government policies on private R&D investment has long been a subject of interest among growth theorists. Since the pioneering work of Romer (1990), Grossman and Helpman (1991), and Aghion and Howitt (1992), a substantial body of research has examined the determinants of private R&D investment and its relation to economic growth. 2 These so-called R&D-based growth models provide a micro-founded framework for analyzing research policies. Most of the existing studies, however, focus exclusively on the e\u00a4ects of tax incentives (such as tax exemptions and tax credits) for private R&D and overlook the importance of direct government spending on innovative activities. 3 Since World War II, the U.S. government has played a crucial role in funding these activities. Although the overall importance of public R&D spending has declined since the 1960s, the government remains the most important source of \u2026nancial support for one particular type of research, namely basic research. 4 Basic research is one of the three major categories of research activities, the other two being applied research and development. 5 Basic research refers to studies that are solely intended to advance our knowledge on fundamental principles or fundamental aspects of phenomena (e.g., research on pure science and pure mathematics). In particular, this type of research is not directed towards any speci\u2026c application or commercial goal. Applied research and development, on the other hand, refer to studies that are targeted towards a speci\u2026c practical goal or the actual production of new products. Thus, the objectives of basic and \"non-basic\" research are fundamentally di\u00a4erent. Empirical evidence shows that basic research often provides the basis for non-basic research (Mans\u2026eld, 1995;Narin et al. 1997), and it seems to have a larger contribution to productivity growth than non-basic research (Mans\u2026eld, 1980;Griliches, 1986). These two types of research also di\u00a4er markedly in terms of funding source and performing sector. federally funded research and development centers (7.7 percent), and federal agencies (7.2 percent). The rest was performed by private industries. This contrasts sharply with the fact that 82.0 percent of applied research and development was conducted in the private sector. 7 These observations suggest that it is important to distinguish between basic and non-basic research when analyzing the impact of public R&D spending. In this study, we develop an endogenous growth model which takes into account the major di\u00a4erences between basic and non-basic research, and the importance of direct government spending on basic research. Our analysis also takes into account several empirical trends in the U.S. economy over the period , such as a rapid increase in the employment of researchers (relative to total employment), a persistent decline in corporate income tax, the introduction of R&D tax credit in 1981, and other changes in \u2026scal policies. In our model framework, basic research is targeted towards the creation of fundamental knowledge, whereas non-basic research is directed at improving the quality of productive inputs. Fundamental knowledge is bene\u2026cial to society because it can improve \u2026rm productivity and enhance the 6 Most of the federal obligations for applied research and development are defense-oriented. For instance, the Department of Defense and the defense programs under the National Nuclear Security Administration accounted for 68.6 percent of these obligations in 2009. On the other hand, these federal agencies only accounted for 5.3 percent of all the federal obligations for basic research in the same year. 7 See Section 2 for more information about the patterns of R&D spending and how they change over time. e\u00a2ciency of non-basic research. This type of knowledge is freely available to all parties once it is discovered. Since there is no private ownership of fundamental knowledge, no \u2026rm is willing to invest in basic research. Hence, basic research is entirely funded by the government in our framework. 8 On the other hand, innovations created by non-basic research are protected by patents, which establish perpetual monopoly rights over the sale of the improved products. The pro\u2026t stream generated by these rights provides the sole incentive for conducting non-basic research. In this study, we con\u2026ne our attention to non-basic research that is funded and conducted by pro\u2026t-maximizing \u2026rms. 9 Both basic and non-basic research require the use of highly trained and specialized workers, or researchers. The supply of these workers is exogenously given and inelastic at any given point of time. The assumption of inelastic supply captures the fact that it requires a considerable amount of time to train someone to do research, hence the total number of researchers cannot respond immediately to changes in market conditions. In each period, an exogenous fraction of researchers is recruited by the government to conduct basic research. This in turn determines the scale of public R&D spending and the growth rate of fundamental knowledge. The accumulation of fundamental knowledge brought by basic research, and the continuous improvement of input quality made possible by non-basic research are the two driving forces of technological advancement in our model. Similar to the neoclassical growth paradigm, the model developed here displays a rich set of transitional dynamics which is jointly determined by capital accumulation and technological improvements. In the theoretical analysis, we show that the model economy will eventually converge to a unique long-run balanced-growth equilibrium that does not exhibit the scale e\u00a4ect. 10 In terms of policy implications, our model suggests that government-\u2026nanced basic research is a strong impetus to long-term economic growth. On the contrary, subsidizing private R&D investment (either in the form of tax exemptions or tax credits) has no e\u00a4ect on long-term economic growth. To further explore the growth and welfare implications of these research policies, we construct a parameterized version of the model and solve for the equilibrium time paths of all major economic variables using numerical methods. Under the baseline parameterization, our model is able to replicate the patterns of R&D investment rate and the 8 A detailed discussion on this assumption is provided in Section 2. 9 As mentioned in footnote 6, most of the government spending on non-basic research is defense-oriented. As pointed out by Mowery (2010), the unusual institutional setting of defense R&D programs and the speci\u2026c nature of military inventions make it di\u00a2cult to evaluate the impact of defense R&D on the entire economy. Consequently, much of our understanding on the e\u00a4ects of defense R&D is derived from case studies on particular industries. While these studies have raised some interesting issues (such as the e\u00a4ects of public procurement on private R&D, and the civilian innovations that are inspired by defense R&D), we do not pursue them here, but rather focus on the e\u00a4ects of government basic research spending. 1 0 More precisely, our model predicts that long-term economic growth is independent of the size of population and the total number of researchers. Similar to the models of Jones (1995), Segerstrom (1998), Peretto (1998), Howitt (1999) and Jones and Williams (2000), our model predicts that long-term economic growth depends positively on the long-term population growth rate. However, perpetual growth in per-capita variables is still possible even if the size of population or the total number of researchers ceases to grow in the long run. increase in real per-worker GDP in the United States over the period 1953-2009. 11 We then perform a series of counterfactual experiments and welfare analyses in order to gauge the e\u00a4ects of research policies. There are four major \u2026ndings from the numerical analyses. First, subsidizing private R&D investment has no e\u00a4ect on technological progress and economic growth in both the short run and the long run. This is because R&D subsidies can only stimulate the demand for innovative activities and the demand for researchers, but have no e\u00a4ect on the supply of researchers which is inelastic at any point of time. Hence, subsidizing private R&D will only drive up the equilibrium wage rate for researchers without a\u00a4ecting the equilibrium quantity of labor input in innovative activities. Consequently, it has no e\u00a4ect on technological progress and economic growth. 12 This result is consistent with the empirical \u2026ndings reported by Goolsbee (1998), and the ideas discussed in Romer (2001). Our second major \u2026nding is that the rapid increase in the number of researchers (relative to total employment) is an important contributing factor to U.S. economic growth. Under the baseline parameterization, our model suggests that 21.3 percent of TFP growth and 25.8 percent of the growth in real per-worker output over the period 1953-2009 can be attributed to this factor. Third, unlike R&D subsidies, direct government spending on basic research can e\u00a4ectively promote technological progress and economic growth. Our model suggests that 12.5 percent of TFP growth and 14.3 percent of the growth in real per-worker output between 1953 and 2009 can be attributed to the rising share of government basic research spending in total R&D expenditures. 13 Our results also suggest that about two-thirds of the long-term economic growth in the United States can be attributed to the accumulation of fundamental knowledge. Because of these positive growth e\u00a4ects, a permanent increase in government basic research spending can induce signi\u2026cant welfare gains for consumers. Finally, our results point to the signi\u2026cance of general equilibrium e\u00a4ects (or price e\u00a4ects) when evaluating the welfare implications of research policies. As we mentioned earlier, the e\u00a4ects of R&D subsidies are manifested solely on the equilibrium wage rate for researchers. As for government-\u2026nanced basic research, a permanent increase in this type of spending not only accelerates the pace of technological progress, it also drives up the equilibrium real interest rates. From an innovating \u2026rm's perspective, higher interest rates mean that the pro\u2026t stream generated by an improved product is now discounted at higher rates. This lowers the \u2026rm's incentives to invest in non-basic research and their demand for researchers. Thus, 1 1 Throughout this paper, R&D investment rate is de\u2026ned as the share of total R&D spending in GDP. 1 2 There are two reasons why this result does not appear in other studies, such as Peretto (1998), Segerstrom (1998) and Impullitti (2010). First, these studies do not distinguish between researchers and non-researchers. Instead, they assume that all workers are identical and freely mobile between research sector and production sector. Hence, the supply of labor for research activities is not inelastic. Second, these studies typically use labor as the numeraire which means wage rate is normalized to one in every period. Thus, R&D subsidies has no e\u00a4ect on the equilibrium wage rate in their models. 1 3 According to our measure, the share of government basic research spending in total R&D expenditures has increased from 7.25 percent in 1953 to 13.86 percent in 2009. The time-series data of this share is shown in Figure 8. following a permanent increase in government basic research spending, the relative wage of researchers to non-researchers declines initially before rising to the new (and higher) long-run level. Ignoring the price e\u00a4ects during the transition period will thus lead to an overestimation of the welfare gains from government-\u2026nanced basic research. Other studies that have explored the growth e\u00a4ects of public R&D spending include Park (1998), Morales (2004), and Akcigit et al. (2012). The \u2026rst two studies have generalized the model of Romer (1990) to allow for government-\u2026nanced research. Both of them \u2026nd that government R&D policies can have a signi\u2026cant impact on long-term economic growth. These studies, however, do not explore the quantitative implications of their models. The present study is closer in spirit to Akcigit et al. (2012) in the sense that both have developed an endogenous growth model with basic and non-basic research, and explored the quantitative implications of the model. However, the theoretical constructs and quantitative analyses in these two studies are very di\u00a4erent. In the model of Akcigit et al. (2012), private \u2026rms can choose to operate in multiple industries and invest in both basic and applied research. Workers are assumed to be homogeneous and freely mobile across industries and across sectors. In their theoretical analysis, these authors focus on characterizing the variations of R&D spending across di\u00a4erent types of \u2026rms in the long-run stationary equilibrium, and their implications to long-term economic growth. In the quantitative analysis, they estimate the long-run equilibrium solution of their model using \u2026rm-level data for France over the period 2000-2006. In the current study, we focus on the temporal patterns of public and private research spending, and analyze the impact of research policies in both the short run and the long run. In the quantitative analysis, we calibrate our model using existing empirical estimates and aggregate data for the United States over the past several decades, and quantify the e\u00a4ects of research policies that are speci\u2026c to the United States. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the empirical trends of R&D spending and the total number of researchers in the United States. Section 3 describes the model economy. Section 4 de\u2026nes the equilibrium of the model and presents the main theoretical results. Section 5 explains the choices of the baseline parameter values. Section 6 presents the numerical results. This is followed by some concluding remarks in Section 7."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Trends", "text": "In this section, we brie \u2021y summarize the key patterns of R&D spending in the United States. 14 Figure   1 shows the share of total R&D spending in U.S. GDP over the period 1953-2009. Between 1953and 1964, R&D investment rate increased rapidly from 1.36 percent to 2.88 percent. Since then, it has been maintained between two and three percent. Figure 2 shows the distribution of total R&D spending among basic research, applied research and development. Over the entire sample period, development accounted for more than 60 percent of total R&D spending in the United States, while applied research accounted for another 20 percent. Despite the importance of non-basic research, the share of basic research spending has been persistently increasing over the years. In 1953, basic research accounted for 8.9 percent of total R&D spending. This increased to 19.0 percent in 2009. Next, we turn to the importance of government and private industries in funding and performing these research activities. Figure 3 shows the breakdown of basic research spending by funding source. Table 1 shows the distribution of basic research output (measured in terms of scienti\u2026c publications) by performing sector. Throughout the entire sample period, the U.S. government played a predominant role in funding basic research. In particular, the government has funded about 70 percent of all the basic research performed in academia, which is the primary contributor of scienti\u2026c publications. Another important observation from Figure 3 and Table 1 is that, while private industries have funded and performed a substantial amount of basic research, they have produced only a small fraction of the output. This seems to suggest that the amount private \u2026rms spend on basic research may not truly re \u2021ect their importance in the creation of fundamental knowledge. In a well-cited article on industrial R&D, Rosenberg (1990) suggests two possible reasons why private \u2026rms would choose to invest in and maintain a basic research capability: First, this type of capability is crucial for planning and evaluating non-basic research. Second, it is also essential for understanding and exploiting the knowledge created by academic research. 15 Thus, according to this view, the main reason why private \u2026rms invest in basic research is to enhance their performance in non-basic research, not to create fundamental knowledge. While it is di\u00a2cult to test this hypothesis rigorously, it does seem to explain the empirical evidence mentioned above. Given the relatively insigni\u2026cant role of private industries in the creation of fundamental knowledge, we choose to 1 4 Unless otherwise stated, all the data reported in this section were taken from National Patterns of R&D Resources: 2009 Data Update compiled by the NSF. 1 5 The same author also pointed out that for industrial R&D the distinction between basic and non-basic research is often not that clear. For instance, in the Survey of Industrial Research and Development conducted by the NSF, industrial basic research is de\u2026ned as \"the pursuit of new scienti\u2026c knowledge or understanding that does not have speci\u2026c immediate commercial objectives, although it may be in \u2026elds of present or potential commercial interest.\" This de\u2026nition can be found in Research and Development in Industry: 2006-07, Appendix A. abstract away from basic research funded by private \u2026rms. This assumption helps keep the dynamics of the model tractable and allows us to focus on the growth and welfare e\u00a4ects of government basic research spending. Figure 4 shows the distribution of non-basic research spending by funding source. It is evident from this diagram that the importance of government spending on applied research and development has been declining since the 1960s. Figure 5 shows that this decline is coincident with the cutbacks in defenserelated and space-related R&D programs. In the present study, we only take into account two types of research activities: (i) government-\u2026nanced basic research, and (ii) applied research and development performed by private industries. Thus, when comparing the model to data, we use the sum of R&D expenditures incurred by these activities as our measure of total R&D spending (see Appendix C for more details). For the period 1953-2009, our measure of total R&D spending represents 77.3 percent of the U.S. total. The implied R&D investment rates are shown in Figure 1 (labelled as \"Our Measure\"). Over the past several decades, the U.S. has also witnessed a rapid increase in the employment of researchers. Figure 6 shows the growth factor of the number of full-time R&D scientists and engineers employed by private industries and the growth factor of total employment in the United States. 16 Between 1953 and 2009, the employment of private-sector researchers has increased by a factor of 8.75, while total U.S. employment has increased by a factor of 2.29."}, {"section_title": "The Model", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Demographics", "text": "The model economy is populated by two types of households, namely high-skilled (H) and low-skilled (L) households.

It has two main properties. First, high-quality inputs are weighted more heavily than low-quality ones, which means the former are more productive than the latter. Second, di\u00a4erent quality grades of the same input are treated as perfect substitutes in the production of \u2026nal goods. These quality-augmented measures are then aggregated by a standard Dixit-Stiglitz aggregator to form the composite measure M t . Formally, this is given by The elasticity of substitution between any two types of intermediate inputs is given by 1= (1 ) : 18 The productivity factor t is taken as exogenously given by the \u2026rms, and is determined by where X t is the stock of fundamental knowledge created by basic research available at the beginning of time t. In the model economy, basic research is entirely funded by the government and its outcomes are freely accessible to all \u2026rms and consumers. In other words, fundamental knowledge is non-excludable. It is also non-rivalrous, which means the use of fundamental knowledge by one \u2026rm does not reduce its availability to others. Thus, all \u2026rms can bene\u2026t from the existing stock of fundamental knowledge to the same extent. Since fundamental knowledge is a public good, we will also refer to it as public R&D capital. Equation (4) states that public R&D capital is bene\u2026cial to \u2026rm productivity. This assumption is supported by the empirical \u2026ndings in Adams (1990), Nadiri and Mamuneas (1994), and Luintel and Khan (2011). 19 An isoelastic function is used to ensure the existence of balanced-growth equilibria. The parameter can be interpreted as the elasticity of TFP with respect to public R&D capital. Since the production function in (1) is homogeneous of degree one, we can focus on the choices made by a single, price-taking \u2026rm. Let w L;t be the wage rate for low-skilled worker at time t: The representative \u2026rm's problem is given by  The \u2026rst-order condition with respect to M t (j; !) is which holds with equality if M t (j; !) > 0: The expression on the right-hand side of (6) is the marginal product of M t (j; !) : The \u2026rst-order condition in (6) has two main implications. First, if the price of input (j; !) is strictly greater than its marginal product, then the representative \u2026rm will choose to have M t (j; !) = 0: Second, for any given type of intermediate input, say ! 2 [0; 1] ; the \u2026rm will only purchase those quality grades that have the lowest quality-adjusted price, p t (j; !) = j : Let e p t (!) be the lowest quality-adjusted price for intermediate input ! at time t. Following Segerstrom (1998), we use the following assumption to break ties: If more than one quality grades of the same type of intermediate input charge the same quality-adjusted price, then the representative \u2026rm will only purchase the one with the highest quality. This ensures that only one quality grade of each type of intermediate input will be used in every period. 21 If the representative \u2026rm chooses to use input (j; !) ; i.e., if M t (j; !) > 0; then its demand function is given by where E t denotes total expenditure on intermediate inputs at time t; i.e., and P t is a quality-adjusted price index de\u2026ned by A formal derivation of these expressions can be found in Appendix A."}, {"section_title": "Intermediate-Goods Sector", "text": "In the intermediate-goods sector, there is a continuum of in\u2026nitely-lived \u2026rms.

These Each monopolistic \u2026rm is made up of two divisions: the manufacturing division and the R&D division. 2 1 This assumption also simpli\u2026es the pricing decisions faced by the suppliers of these inputs.

This technology is given by where Y M;t denotes the quantity of intermediate goods produced at time t, K t and L M;t denote the quantities of physical capital and low-skilled labor employed. The productivity factor t is the same as in (4). Similar to the \u2026nal-good producers, the monopolistic \u2026rms do not own the factors of production. Thus, they have to hire low-skilled workers and rent physical capital from the competitive factor markets in every period. As for the R&D process, we assume that high-skilled labor is the only private input employed in quality improvement research. 24 Let M;t be the quantity of high-skilled labor employed by an individual \u2026rm at time t; and let M;t be the average level of high-skilled labor input among all innovating \u2026rms in the intermediate-goods sector.

This measure is taken as exogenously given by individual \u2026rms, and is determined by The function (q; q t ) is assumed to be strictly positive, strictly increasing in the quality of the product (q) ; and strictly decreasing in the leading-edge quality (q t ) : In the existing R&D-based growth models, it is typical to assume that labor is the only input employed in R&D activities. See for instance, Aghion and Howitt (1992), Young (1995), Segerstrom (1998)  Equations (10) and (11) capture four fundamental aspects of quality improvement research. First, the probability of successful quality improvement is strictly increasing in the \u2026rm's own labor input. Since # 2 (0; 1), this type of input is subject to diminishing marginal returns. The concavity assumption is consistent with the empirical \u2026ndings in Pakes and Griliches (1984) and Hall et al. (1986). Second, the di\u00a2culty of quality improvement research is strictly decreasing in the existing stock of fundamental knowledge. In other words, fundamental knowledge is bene\u2026cial to the e\u00a2ciency of private R&D. This assumption is supported by the empirical \u2026ndings in Ja\u00a4e (1989), Mans\u2026eld (1995Mans\u2026eld ( , 1998, Anselin et al. (1997) and Zucker et al. (1998). Third, holding other things constant, high-quality products are more di\u00a2cult to develop than low-quality ones. Thus, it becomes increasingly di\u00a2cult to move up the quality ladder. This feature is captured by the assumption that (q; q t ) is strictly increasing in q for all q t : Finally, research carried out by one \u2026rm will also create external bene\u2026ts for other innovating \u2026rms. 25 This type of externality, or knowledge spillover, can occur in two ways: (i) when researchers communicate and interact with each other, and (ii) when individual researchers learn from other people's success (e.g., by reading the codi\u2026ed part of a patent or by reverse engineering). The expression 1 # M;t in (10) is intended to capture the bene\u2026ts created by the \u2026rst channel. The main idea behind this expression is as follows: As the size of the research community expands, more interactions among researchers will be available and so the e\u00a4ects of knowledge spillover will become larger. To ensure the existence of balanced-growth equilibria, we assume that the function in (10) is homogeneous of degree one in M;t and M;t : The second channel of knowledge spillover is captured by the assumption that (q; q t ) is strictly decreasing in q t for all q: In words, this means all innovating \u2026rms can learn and bene\u2026t from the leading-edge improvement, so that an increase in q t will increase their research e\u00a2ciency. 26 The \u2026rm's research outlay at time t is given by w H;t M;t ; where w H;t is the wage rate for high-skilled labor. These expenses are subject to two types of preferential tax treatment which we will explain later. If an improved product is developed at time t, then the \u2026rm can start producing it as a monopoly at time t + 1: In each period, each monopolistic \u2026rm has to make two groups of decisions. First, it has to decide how much to produce and what price to charge for its product. Second, it has to decide how much to 2 5 There is now a large body of empirical studies which con\u2026rm the existence and signi\u2026cance of knowledge spillover across \u2026rms. See, for instance, Ja\u00a4e (1986), Feldman (1996, 2004) and references therein. 2 6 The variable t ( ) is similar in spirit to the R&D di\u00a2culty index de\u2026ned in Segerstrom (1998), Dinopoulos and Segerstrom (1999) and Impullitti (2010). In the \u2026rst study, the di\u00a2culty index is determined by the past history of R&D investment in each industry, and is thus di\u00a4erent across industries. In Impullitti (2010), the di\u00a2culty index is identical for all industries and directly proportional to the size of total population. Dinopoulos and Segerstrom (1999) have considered the e\u00a4ects of trade liberalization under both speci\u2026cations. These studies, however, do not consider the e\u00a4ects of fundamental knowledge on the di\u00a2culty of private R&D. invest in quality improvement research. Since the monopolists do not own the factors of production, the choices of physical capital and low-skilled labor in the production stage are static in nature and do not interfere with the research investment decisions. Likewise, the choice of high-skilled labor input in the research stage has no direct impact on the production process. Thus, the two groups of decisions can be analyzed separately."}, {"section_title": "Production and Pricing Decisions", "text": "Since all \u2026nal-good producers use only one quality grade of each type of intermediate input in any period, each intermediate-good producer will only supply one quality grade of its products. 27 In particular, these producers will always choose to produce the best quality grade of their products. To see this, suppose the supplier of intermediate good ! 2 [0; 1] chooses to produce quality grade j at time t; for some j 2 f0; 1; :::; J t (!)g : Given a Cobb-Douglas production function, the minimum cost of producing M 0 where t is the unit cost of production. This cost is determined by where R t is the rental price of physical capital at time t: Low-skilled workers are freely mobile across sectors, so there is only one wage rate (w L;t ) for these workers. Since the production technology is identical for all types of intermediate goods, so is the unit cost of production. The monopoly price of product (j; !) can be obtained by solving where the market demand function M t (j; !) is stated in (7). 28 The optimal monopoly price involves a proportional mark-up over the unit cost and is identical for all (j; !).

The tax rate at time t is denoted by p;t 2 (0; 1). When deciding how much to invest in quality improvement research, the \u2026rm takes into account two types of preferential tax treatment on private R&D expenses. First, these expenses are fully deductible from corporate income tax. Second, these expenses are also eligible for additional subsidies, or R&D tax credits. The rate of subsidy at time t is d;t 2 (0; 1) : Both the corporate income tax rate and the R&D subsidy rate are changing over time in a deterministic manner, and they are fully anticipated by the \u2026rm. In each period, the \u2026rm distributes its pro\u2026ts (net of taxes and research outlay) as dividends to its owners. Each monopolistic \u2026rm has a \u2026xed number of shares outstanding in the equity market. The total number of shares issued by each \u2026rm is constant over time and is normalized to one.

The marginal bene\u2026t is determined by two factors: (i) the increase in success rate brought by an additional unit of high-skilled labor, and (ii) the present value of the net gain from the improved product. Note that a successful improvement from quality q to q not only creates some new value for the \u2026rm [i.e., V t+1 ( q)], but also destroys the continuation value of the original product [i.e., V t+1 (q)] which now becomes obsolete. Hence, the bene\u2026t of successful research is measured by the net gain in the \u2026rm's future value. Holding other things constant, an increase in either the corporate income tax rate ( p;t ) or the R&D tax credit ( d;t ) will lower the marginal cost of hiring high-skilled labor and encourage the \u2026rm's demand for research input."}, {"section_title": "Distribution of Product Quality", "text": "Since the timing and frequency of quality improvement is idiosyncratic across intermediate goods, a nondegenerate distribution of product quality emerges in every period t 1: The distribution of product quality is de\u2026ned over the support Q 1; ; 2 ; ::: : Consider those intermediate goods with state-of-the-art quality q 2 Q at the beginning of time t: The share of these goods is denoted by f t (q) 2 [0; 1] ; with P q2Q f t (q) = 1 for all t: The initial distribution is degenerate and is denoted by f 0 (1) = 1: For future references, de\u2026ne an aggregate quality index Q t according to The initial degenerate distribution then implies Q 0 = 1 and q 0 = 1: The evolution of the quality distribution can be characterized as follows.

Thus, the leading-edge quality level will evolve according to q t+1 = q t with probability one."}, {"section_title": "Basic Research", "text": "In the model economy, a continuum of basic research projects is available in every period. Each project is indexed by a positive scalar z which indicates its quality. The set of research projects available at time t is uniformly distributed over the range [0; z t ] : The upper boundary z t represents the most advanced project at time t: This value is assumed to be changing over time in a deterministic manner. The speci\u2026cs of this will be explained later. In each period, each member of the high-skilled household draws a single basic research project from the uniform distribution. The draws are independent over time and across individuals. After observing z; a high-skilled consumer then seeks outside funding in order to develop the project. If the project is unfunded, then the consumer will work as a researcher in the intermediate-goods sector (the private sector). Even if outside funding is available, the consumer can still decide whether or not to proceed with the project. If he chooses not to proceed, then again he will work in the private sector. If he chooses to proceed, then he will have to invest his own time endowment (which is normalized to one) on the project. Similar to quality improvement research, basic research only requires high-skilled labor as input and its success is uncertain. If a project of quality z is successfully developed at time t, then it will create (z) X t units of new fundamental knowledge. The function : [0; z t ] ! R + is continuous and strictly increasing, which means high-quality projects contribute more to the growth rate of fundamental knowledge than low-quality ones. No new knowledge is created if the project fails. The probability of successfully developing a type-z project at time t is given by In the above expression, the numerator represents individual researcher's own labor input (which is one), and the denominator indicates the di\u00a2culty of developing a type-z project at time t: The di\u00a2culty index is determined by with % > 0: Both x : R + ! R ++ and = : R + ! R + are continuous, strictly increasing functions. Equation 23captures three important aspects of basic research. First, the di\u00a2culty of basic research in general is strictly decreasing in the available stock of fundamental knowledge. This captures the idea that past discoveries of basic research are bene\u2026cial to the productivity of current research. 29 Second, high-quality projects are more di\u00a2cult to develop than low-quality ones. This assumption is captured by the strictly increasing function x ( ) : Third, as the economy becomes more technologically advanced, basic research projects become more di\u00a2cult for researchers to develop individually. This assumption is captured by the strictly increasing function = (Q t ) ; where Q t is used as a measure of technological development. The main ideas behind this assumption are as follows: A basic research project can be viewed as a collection of tasks. As technology advances, more sophisticated and specialized techniques for conducting basic research are available and adopted. As a result, the tasks involved in basic research projects also become more specialized. This makes it more di\u00a2cult for a single researcher to complete all the tasks in these projects. This hypothesis provides a potential explanation for the increasing prevalence of collaboration and teamwork among scientists. 30 In particular, it is consistent with the fact that scienti\u2026c collaboration is more common in \u2026elds that require complex instrumentation (or \"big science\"). 31 The function = (Q t ) represents one of two channels through which innovations brought by quality improvement research can feedback into basic research. The second channel is built upon the idea that major breakthroughs in non-basic research or technology often open up new areas of scienti\u2026c studies. 32 To capture this mechanism in the most parsimonious manner, we set z t = q t for all t: In words, this means a leading-edge improvement in technology will also broaden the range of scienti\u2026c research. 33 Under this speci\u2026cation, the upper bound z t will increase deterministically over time according to z t+1 = z t : Next, we turn to the supply side of basic research funding. As we mentioned earlier, due to the publicgood nature of fundamental knowledge, no \u2026rm is willing to invest in basic research. Consequently, basic research projects are solely funded by the government. 34 The amount and allocation of basic research funding is determined by a national research agency. In each period, the government agency chooses a set of research projects so as to maximize the growth rate of fundamental knowledge subject to a policy constraint. Let D t [0; z t ] be a non-empty set of research projects funded by the government. For those research projects with quality z 2 D t ; a fraction x;t (z) of them will succeed and create (z) X t units of 3 0 For the empirical evidence on the rising trend of scienti\u2026c collaboration, see Beaver and Rosen (1979) and Stephan (1996, Table 4). Other possible explanations for this phenomenon have been examined by Katz and Martin (1997) and Jones (2009). 3 1 For instance, Katz and Martin (1997) and Klein (2005) point out that many projects in high-energy physics, astronomy, oceanography, and life sciences (e.g., the Human Genome Project) require sophisticated and specialized equipments such as particle accelerators, observatories, ocean research vessels, and supercomputers. Consequently, research in these areas typically require collaborations between specialists in di\u00a4erent \u2026elds. In other words, it is very di\u00a2cult (if not impossible) for a single researcher to perform all the tasks involved in these research projects. 3 2 See, for instance, Rosenberg (1990, p.169) for some speci\u2026c examples. 3 3 Our theoretical analysis can be easily extended to accomodate a more general relationship between q t and zt: For instance, one can assume that zt is strictly increasing in q t and {t; where {t represents other exogenous factors that can also a\u00a4ect the range of scienti\u2026c research. The assumption that q t and zt share the same exogenous growth rate is not essential for our major results. public R&D capital. The total quantity of public R&D capital produced by the set D t is given by where e (z) (z) = x (z) : The growth of fundamental knowledge is determined by with X 0 > 0 given. In the above expression, the depreciation rate of fundamental knowledge is assumed to be zero. The national research agency is assumed to follow two types of policies when deciding the size and allocation of basic research funding. First, in order to ensure participation in basic research, the wage rate for basic researchers must be no less than the market wage rate for high-skilled workers. Speci\u2026cally, the government agency will o\u00a4er all basic researchers a wage rate t w H;t ; with t 1; regardless of the outcome of their research. If t = 1; then high-skilled workers will be indi\u00a4erent between working in the public and the private sector. We assume that, in this case, workers with basic research projects that are quali\u2026ed for funding will still choose to work in the public sector. Second, the government agency has a targeted scale of basic research in every period. Speci\u2026cally, this means the government will recruit a fraction $ t 2 (0; 1) of high-skilled workers into basic research in every period t. This gives rise to a policy constraint on the choice of D t ; which is The amount of government basic research spending (G x;t ) is then determined by G x;t = $ t t w H;t N H;t : In each period, the government agency's problem is to choose a set of research projects D t [0; z t ] so as to maximize the growth of public R&D capital in (24) subject to the policy constraint in (25). 35 The solution of this problem depends crucially on the shape of e (z) (z) = x (z) : Note that this function combines two characteristics of basic research projects: (i) the potential contribution of each project as captured by ( ) ; and (ii) the di\u00a2culty of research project x ( ) which directly a\u00a4ects the rate of success. Since high-quality projects are also more di\u00a2cult to develop, the shape of e ( ) cannot be determined a priori. In the current study, we focus on the case in which e ( ) is a strictly increasing function, which means the expected contribution of a basic research project is strictly increasing in its quality. This assumption is desirable because it gives rise to an intuitive solution which can be obtained in a straightforward way. More speci\u2026cally, under this assumption, the optimal set of research projects is given by This result is summarized in Proposition 1. 36 All proofs can be found in Appendix B. Proposition 1 Suppose $ t 2 (0; 1) for all t 0 and e ( ) is a strictly increasing function. Then the optimal set of research projects in any time t is given by Proposition 1 has two main implications. First, the government will \u2026nance those research projects with the highest quality in every period. Second, by recruiting a larger share of high-skilled workers into basic research (i.e., increasing the value of $ t ), the government can support a wider range of research projects which in turn enhances the growth rate of fundamental knowledge. In the following analyses, we will adopt the speci\u2026c form e (z) z ' ; with ' > 0: The expected value of e (z) over the optimal set where is strictly increasing in $ t : The maximized growth factor of public R&D capital is now given by"}, {"section_title": "Households", "text": "Both high-skilled and low-skilled households have preferences over consumption sequences which can be for some t; then the high-skilled workers will face idiosyncratic uncertainty in labor income.

A formal derivation of these results can be found in Appendix A. In equilibrium, aggregate output in every period t 0 is determined by where 2 (0; 1) and e A > 0 is a constant. The variable t is de\u2026ned as Equation 37is obtained after combining the production technologies in the \u2026nal-good sector and the intermediate-goods sector. Similar to the neoclassical production function, the aggregate production function in (37) exhibits diminishing returns with respect to physical capital. In the standard neoclassical growth model, the diminishing marginal product of capital is counteracted by an exogenous growth in labor-augmenting technology. Without this type of technological progress, per-capita output will eventually cease to grow. In the current framework, t plays the same role as labor-augmenting technology in the neoclassical framework. The source of growth in our model, however, is endogenously determined. In particular, it is driven by the accumulation of fundamental knowledge created by basic research and the continuous improvement in productive inputs made possible by non-basic research. Formally, the growth factor of t can be expressed as The accumulation of fundamental knowledge is determined by (26). The growth rate of Q t is determined by the dynamics of the quality distribution ff t (q) : q 2 Qg, which is in turn determined by the optimal quantity of input employed in quality improvement research M;t ( ) ; and the value of the im-proved products V t ( ) : Both fV t ( )g 1 t=0 and f M;t ( )g 1 t=0 are sequences of unknown functions that need to be determined in equilibrium. In general, it is very di\u00a2cult to analyze a non-stationary equilibrium with sequences of unknown functions. For this reason, we seek conditions under which exact analytical solutions for V t ( ) and M;t ( ) are available. These conditions are stated in Proposition 2. where t > 0 is an unknown coe\u00a2cient. The values of f t g 1 t=0 are determined by the dynamic equation The results in Proposition 2 are extremely useful in simplifying the equilibrium analysis. Instead of solving for two sequences of in\u2026nite-dimensional objects (the unknown functions), now we only need to determine a sequence of real numbers f t g 1 t=0 : Note that the analytical solution for V t ( ) and M;t ( ) are both directly proportional to q 1 in every period t 0: This property is intuitive because, in equilibrium, the monopolists' input demand functions, L M;t (q) and K t (q) ; and pro\u2026t function t (q) ; are all directly proportional to q 1 in every period. Using the results in Proposition 2, we can show that Q t will evolve over time according to with initial value Q 0 = 1: 38 Equation (41) states that the growth rate of aggregate quality increases with an increase in (i) the stock of fundamental knowledge, (ii) the number of high-skilled workers available for private R&D, (iii) the size of quality improvement ; and (iv) the leading-edge quality q t : The growth rate of Q t is also inversely related to its own level. Notice that the equilibrium dynamics of Q t are not a\u00a4ected by the corporate income tax rate ( p;t ) nor the R&D subsidy rate ( d;t ) : This follows from the fact that both the equilibrium quantity of labor input employed in quality improvement research [i.e., (1 $ t ) N H;t ] and the distribution of this input [as captured by M;t ( )] are independent of these policy instruments. The equilibrium dynamics of Q t and X t are now completely characterized by (26) and (41). Once the values of fQ t ; X t g 1 t=0 are determined, we can derive the values of f t g 1 t=0 using (38). In equilibrium, the economy-wide resources constraint in period t is given by where A t e A (1 t ) 1 : The second line is obtained by using N L;t = (1 t ) N t : The notation C t P s2fH;Lg N s;t c s;t represents aggregate consumption at time t: The Euler equation in (29) states that the growth rates of c H;t and c L;t are identical in every period. Thus, there exists a positive real number such that c H;t = c L;t for all t 0: The value of is endogenously determined in equilibrium (see Appendix A for more details). Based on this observation, we can express aggregate consumption as The growth of aggregate consumption is then determined by Note that changes in the composition of the labor force (as captured by t ) and the tax rate on consumption will also a\u00a4ect the growth rate of aggregate consumption.

The values of ( under a given value of b k T > 0: We will refer to this as the subsystem for b c t and b k t : Note that this is a non-autonomous system as it depends on the time-varying growth factor of t which is independent of b c t and b k t . A solution to the subsystem for Q t and X t is called a balanced-growth path (BGP) if the growth rates of these variables are constant over time. A BGP is called globally stable if it exhibits the following property: Starting from any positive values of X T and Q T ; any solution to the subsystem will eventually converge to the BGP. If the subsystem for Q t and X t is globally stable, then the growth rates of Q t and X t (and hence t ) will converge to some constants when t is su\u00a2ciently large. Let be the long-term growth rate of t : As the growth rate of t approaches ; the subsystem for b c t and b k t will converge to an autonomous system, Note that this autonomous system is essentially the same as the one in the standard neoclassical growth model. Thus, we know that it has a unique non-trivial steady state b c ; b k which is saddle-path stable. If the subsystem for Q t and X t has a unique globally stable BGP, then the long-run growth rate is unique and the model economy will eventually converge to a unique long-run balanced-growth equilibrium. Our next proposition provides a set of conditions under which the subsystem for Q t and X t has a unique globally stable BGP. where = > 0 and > 0 are two arbitrary constants. Then the subsystem for Q t and X t has a unique globally stable balanced-growth path. Both = and are arbitrary constants that have no signi\u2026cance for our subsequent analyses, hence we set them equal to one. Along the unique globally stable BGP, we have where e X is the long-run stationary value of the transformed variable e In the proof of Proposition 3, we show that this transformed variable plays a key role in characterizing the subsystem for Q t and X t : The value of e X is uniquely determined by Substituting (44)- (46) into (39) gives with e a 1 = (1 ) (1 ) # > 0; e a 2 = 'e a 1 > 0; and e a 3 = In a balanced-growth equilibrium, all per-capita variables will grow at the same constant rate in every period, and all major aggregate variables, such as Y t ; C t ; E t ; G x;t ; K t ; will grow by the same constant factor (1 + n ) (1 + ) : What remains is to ensure that the transversality condition in the household's problem is satis\u2026ed. This can be achieved by imposing some mild additional conditions. 40 Our existence and uniqueness results are summarized in Proposition 4. Proposition 4 Suppose the conditions in Proposition 3 are satis\u2026ed. In addition, suppose (1 + n ) < 1 and 1: Then there exists a unique balanced-growth equilibrium in which all per-capita variables grow at the same rate > 0 in every period. 4 0 The transversality condition is satis\u2026ed if (1 + ) 1 (1 + n ) < 1: This condition also ensures that household's lifetime utility is \u2026nite in the long-run equilibrium. Since > 0; this condition is satis\u2026ed if (1 + n ) < 1 and 1: The assumption (1 + n ) < 1 is commonly used in models with population growth. The assumption 1 is commonly used in quantitative macroeconomic studies."}, {"section_title": "Determinants of Long-Term Economic Growth", "text": "As we mentioned earlier, long-term economic growth in this model is driven by the accumulation of fundamental knowledge and the continuous improvement of input quality. These two processes are determined by factors such as the long-term population growth rate (n ) ; the share of high-skilled workers participating in basic research ($ ) ; and the size of quality improvement ( ) : The e\u00a4ects of these factors are made clear in the following proposition. Proposition 5 Suppose the conditions in Proposition 4 are satis\u2026ed. Then the following results hold. (i) An increase in n will increase the long-term growth rate of Q t and X t : (ii) An increase in $ will increase the long-term growth rate of Q t and X t : (iii) An increase in has an ambiguous e\u00a4ect on the long-term growth rate of Q t and X t : The intuitions behind these results are as follows. First, an increase in n means that the total supply of researchers will grow at a faster rate in the long run. This increases the equilibrium quantity of labor input in both basic and non-basic research, and thereby raises the growth rate of fundamental knowledge and input quality. Second, by recruiting a larger fraction of researchers into basic research, the government can support a wider range of research projects and promote the accumulation of fundamental knowledge. This e\u00a4ect is captured by the strictly increasing function ($ ) : Such an increase also means that fewer high-skilled workers will be available for quality improvement research. Holding other things constant, this lowers the long-term growth rate of Q t relative to X t and raises the value of e X : The increase in both ($ ) and e X then leads to a higher long-term growth rate of X t . As for quality improvement research, our result suggests that the increase in e X will counteract the decline in (1 $ ) so that an increase in $ will also raise the long-term growth rate of Q t : Finally, an increase in will generate two opposing e\u00a4ects on e X : On one hand, such an increase will speed up the long-term growth rate of Q t (relative to that of X t ) and lead to a reduction in e X : On the other hand, an increase in means that the frontiers of science and technology (as captured by z t and q t ) will advance at a faster pace. This will in turn raise the value of e X : Thus, the overall e\u00a4ect on e X is ambiguous. The long-run growth e\u00a4ects of n and $ are summarized in Corollary 6, which follows immediately from Proposition 5. Corollary 6 Suppose the conditions in Proposition 4 are satis\u2026ed. Then the long-term growth rate depends positively on the long-term population growth rate (n ) and the share of high-skilled workers participating in basic research ($ ) : Our model has three other important predictions regarding long-term economic growth. The \u2026rst one concerns the so-called scale e\u00a4ect (i.e., the e\u00a4ect of population size on long-term economic growth). Unlike the models of Romer (1990), Grossman and Helpman (1991), and Aghion and Howitt (1992), our model predicts that long-term economic growth is independent of the size of population. Similar to the models of Jones (1995Jones ( , 2002, Segerstrom (1998), Peretto (1998), Howitt (1999) and Jones and Williams (2000), our model predicts that long-term economic growth depends positively on the population growth rate. This, however, does not mean that population growth is indispensable for economic growth. Our next proposition shows that perpetual growth in per-capita variables is still possible even when there is no population growth in the long run. 41 In this case, perpetual growth is sustained by the continuous advancement of the frontiers of science and technology. Proposition 7 Suppose the conditions in Proposition 4 are satis\u2026ed. Then the long-term growth rate is strictly positive even when there is no population growth in the long run, i.e., n = 0: Second, our model suggests that neither corporate income tax p nor R&D subsidy ( d ) has any e\u00a4ect on the long-term growth of Q t and X t : Consequently, providing tax incentives for private R&D has no e\u00a4ect on long-term economic growth. Other theoretical studies, such as Jones (1995), Segerstrom (1998) and Young (1998), also make the same prediction. Third, our model predicts that both the patent-researcher ratio and the patent-R&D ratio are decreasing over time in the long-run balanced-growth equilibrium. This follows from the facts that both the number of researchers and the amount of total R&D spending are growing at some positive rates in the longrun equilibrium, while the total number of patents granted in each period [given by X ] is time-invariant. Hence, the patent-researcher ratio and the patent-R&D ratio are both decreasing over time. This result is consistent with the empirical evidence reported in Kortum (1993) and Segerstrom (1998)."}, {"section_title": "Calibration", "text": "The main purpose of the numerical analysis is to quantify the e\u00a4ects of R&D subsidies and government basic research spending based on the model developed above. To this end, we \u2026rst construct a parameterized version of the model and show that it is able to replicate certain features of the U.S. economy over the period 1953-2009. Our benchmark economy is constructed as follows. First, the model is calibrated so that it matches the actual capital-output ratio and R&D investment rate in 1953. Then, we input the actual time series data on employment growth rates and various policy variables over the period , and solve for the equilibrium time paths of all major economic variables. Finally, we impose the assumption that all model parameters are constant from 2009 onward, and compute the unique long-run equilibrium. 42 Since the length of a period in the model is one year and the initial period is 1953, we set T = 56: Our benchmark model is able to generate patterns of R&D investment and economic growth that are similar to those observed in the United States. We then perform a number of counterfactual experiments and welfare analyses in order to determine the e\u00a4ects of research policies. In this section, we explain the rationale behind our choices of the baseline parameter values. All the numerical results are presented in Section 6. In the benchmark scenario, all the parameters listed in Table 2 are assumed to be time-invariant. Most of these parameter values are chosen based on actual data or existing empirical estimates. Others are calibrated so that the model can match a number of real-world statistics. The details of this procedure are explained below."}, {"section_title": "Parameter Values Based on Empirical Evidence", "text": "Households In the present study, high-skilled workers correspond to those researchers who are engaged in government-\u2026nanced basic research and non-basic research performed in the private sector. Thus, the values of fn H;t ; t g T t=0 should match the annual growth rates of the employment of these researchers, and their share in total U.S. employment over the period . Existing data on these values, however, are very limited. 43 Thus, we have to develop our own proxies for these values. The details of this procedure are described in Appendix C. Regarding the share of researchers in total employment, our estimates show that this share has increased from 0.79 percent in 1953 to 2.97 percent in 2009. Since high-skilled workers only account for a small fraction of total U.S. employment, we equate the values of fn L;t g T t=0 to the annual growth rates of total U.S. employment. Our estimates also show that most of the researchers in the United States are employed in the private sector. Hence, we equate the values of fn H;t g T t=0 to the growth rates of employment of R&D scientists and engineers in the private sector. These two sets of values thus capture the employment growth patterns depicted in Figure 6. The long-run population growth rate (n ) is set to 1.50 percent, which matches the average annual growth rate of total employment between 1953 and 2009. Once we impose the restriction n H;t = n L;t = n for all t T ; the population share of high-skilled workers ( t ) will remain constant at its 2009 value which is 2.97 percent (based on our estimates). As for household preferences, the inverse of elasticity of intertemporal substitution ( ) is set equal to two. This falls within the range of estimates obtained by several empirical studies. 44 It also falls within the range of values that are commonly used in quantitative studies (which is between one and two). The value of is determined by the calibration procedure described in Section 5.2. Production Four parameters appear in the production functions of \u2026nal good and intermediate goods, average value of this ratio is 0.7348 in the U.S. data. 45 Hence, we set = 0:7348: As shown in (13), the parameter captures the extent of markup over the marginal cost of producing intermediate inputs. In the baseline parameterization, we set = 0:9091 which implies a ten percent markup over the marginal cost. This value falls within the range of estimates obtained by Norrbin (1993) and Basu and Fernald (1997). 46 The value of corresponds to the elasticity of TFP with respect to public R&D capital. Using (4) and (12), we can show that is also the elasticity of unit cost ( t ) with respect to public R&D capital. Empirical estimates of these elasticities are relatively scarce. Nadiri and Mamuneas (1994) \u2026nd that the cost elasticities of public R&D capital for twelve U.S. industries range from -0.009 to -0.056. In a recent study, Luintel and Khan (2011) estimate that the elasticity of TFP with respect to basic knowledge stock is 0.149. In the baseline parameterization, we set = 0:10 which falls between these estimates. In the sensitivity analysis, we will examine the e\u00a4ects of changing and on the benchmark results. The value of is chosen based on the calibration procedure described in Section 5.2. 4 4 Using time series data on aggregate consumption in the United States, Atkeson and Ogaki (1996) estimate that the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) is about 0.40, which implies = 2:50: Using data from the Consumption Expenditure Survey, Vissing-J\u00f8rgensen (2002) estimates that the EIS for bondholders is about 0.80 (which means = 1:25) and that for stockholders is about 0.40, whereas Parker and Preston (2005) estimate that the EIS for U.S. households in general is about 0.61 (which means = 1:64): Our choice of thus falls within this range of estimates. 4 5 To compute this value, we \u2026rst collect annual data on intermediate input expenditures from the GDP-by-industry accounts available on the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) website. We then compute the ratio between these expenditures and U.S. GDP for each year in the period 1987-2009. The average value over this period is 0. Government Policies When constructing the benchmark economy, we take into account changes in a number of policy variables. These include the tax rates on incomes and consumption, f w;t ; a;t ; c;t ; p;t g T t=0 ; and the policy instruments that are related to research activities, f d;t ; $ t ; t g T t=0 : For the tax rates on labor income ( w;t ), we use the time series of overall marginal income tax rate reported in Barro and Redlick (2011, Table 1). This overall tax rate is the sum of federal income tax, state income tax and Social Security tax in the United States. For the tax rate on interest income ( a;t ) ; we use the same time series but exclude the Social Security tax which is a payroll tax. Since the data reported in Barro and Redlick (2011) only cover up to the year 2006, we assume that these two tax rates are constant from 2006 onward. The long-run tax rates w and a are 35.3 percent and 26.0 percent, respectively. The tax rates on private consumption expenditures ( c;t ) are approximated using data from the National Income and Product Accounts. 47 The long-run tax rate c is 4.29 percent, which is the value in 2009. The corporate income tax rates f p;t g T t=0 are chosen based on the statutory tax brackets and rates listed in Statistics of Income (SOI) Historical Table 24. These values are depicted in Figure 7. The U.S. corporate income tax rate has been declining throughout the sample period. The most signi\u2026cant development is the reduction in 1987 brought by the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The long-run tax rate p is set equal to 35 percent, which is the tax rate for the highest corporate income tax bracket in 2009. As for R&D policies, we assume that government-employed basic researchers receive the same wage rate as private-sector researchers, so that t = 1 for all t 0: Under this assumption, $ t coincides with the share of government basic research spending in our measure of total R&D expenditures. Thus, we use the actual time series data on this share as the values of f$ t g T t=0 : The inputted values are shown in Figure 8. The long-run value $ is 13.86 percent, which is the value in 2009. Finally, the values of t=0 are computed using the method described in Bloom et al. (2002). The details of this procedure are reported in Appendix C. The time series of the combined subsidy rate for private R&D (i.e., the sum of p;t and d;t ) is shown in Figure 7. Note that there are two major changes in R&D tax credit, one in 1981 and the other in 1990. The long-run R&D tax credit ( d ) is 12.22 percent, which equals the value in the last year of our sample.  Table 3."}, {"section_title": "Calibrated Parameters", "text": "We begin with the \u2026ve target statistics for the long-run equilibrium. The \u2026rst target is the average annual growth rate of real per-worker GDP in the United States over the period 1953-2009, which is 1.56 percent. The second target is the share of labor income in U.S. GDP over the same time period, which is 0.5342. 48 The third target is the before-tax rate of return for physical capital. Using the procedure described in Cooley and Prescott (1995), we \u2026nd that the average rate of return over the period 1953-2009 4 8 This value is computed using data on compensation of employees and proprietors' income over the period 1953-2009. We assume that the share of labor income in proprietors' income is identical to that of the entire economy, so that Labor's share of income = Compensation of Employees GDP -Proprietors' Income : The same procedure is also used in Gomme and Rupert (2007, Section 4.2). is 8 percent (see Appendix C for more details). The fourth target is the average value of the capitaloutput ratio over the period 1953-2009, which is 2.4272. To compute this value, we use the sum of private \u2026xed assets and the end-of-year stock of private inventories as our measure of aggregate physical capital. Our \u2026fth target is intended to capture the long-run level of R&D investment rate in the United States. As shown in Figure 1, R&D investment rate has been \u2021uctuating signi\u2026cantly during the 1960s and the 1970s, but has been stabilized since 1983. For this reason, we use the average value of R&D investment rate over the period 1983-2009 as our target statistic. The value is 2.06 percent. 49 After the value of f ; ; ; ; 'g are determined, we then choose the value of b k 0 and X 0 so that the model can match (i) the capital-output ratio in 1953, which is 2.4097, and (ii) the R&D investment rate in 1953, which is 1.0 percent."}, {"section_title": "Numerical Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Benchmark Economy", "text": "Major Economic Variables Table 3 summarizes the main properties of the long-run equilibrium in our benchmark model. Apart from the \u2026ve targeted statistics, our model is also able to match quite closely two other statistics that are not targeted. The \u2026rst one is the average value of the consumption-output ratio in the United States over the period . The second one is the average value of the ratio of total tax receipts to U.S. GDP. 50 The last result shows that the size of government in our model is similar to its real-world counterpart. Table 4 shows the predicted values of four \"great ratios\" over the period . Overall, our benchmark model is able to generate reasonable values for these ratios. The model, however, cannot capture the secular movements of the capital-output ratio and the downward trend of labor income share. Figure 9 shows the time series of R&D investment rate generated by our benchmark model along with the actual data. In the year 1953, total R&D spending accounted for about one percent of GDP in the United States. This increased sharply during the subsequent years, peaked at 2.20 percent in 1963, and declined during the second half of the 1960s. Our model is able to mimic this hump-shaped pattern, though the peak magnitude of the model-generated series is lower than that in the data. In our benchmark model, R&D investment rate increases from 0.93 percent to 1.97 percent over the period [1953][1954][1955][1956][1957][1958][1959][1960][1961][1962][1963]. Thus, the model is able to explain about 86 percent of the observed increase in R&D investment rate during this period. Our benchmark model is also able to replicate the U-shaped pattern over the period 1969-1985. The sharp \u2021uctuations in the model-generated series during 1981-1990 are mainly driven by the changes in the combined subsidy rate for private R&D. For instance, the sharp increase in 1981 and 1990 are driven by the increase in R&D tax credit in these two years. Similarly, the abrupt fall in 1987 is due to the reduction in corporate income tax which lowers the combined subsidy rate. The e\u00a4ects of these policies will be further explored in Section 6.2."}, {"section_title": "Patterns of R&D Investment Rate", "text": "Growth Accounting Between 1953 and 2009, real per-worker GDP in the United States has increased by a factor of 2.384, which is equivalent to an average annual growth rate of 1.56 percent.

Using the standard growth accounting technique, we can decompose this growth rate into (i) TFP growth and (ii) the growth of physical capital per worker.

In our benchmark model, 56 percent of TFP growth is due to the accumulation of fundamental knowledge. The remaining 44 percent is due to quality improvement."}, {"section_title": "Counterfactual Experiments", "text": "In the benchmark model, we have taken into account changes in several exogenous factors, such as (i) corporate income tax, (ii) R&D tax credit, (iii) the share of government basic research spending in total R&D expenditures, and (iv) the growth rates of high-skilled and low-skilled employment. In this subsection, we examine the signi\u2026cance of each of these factors in explaining R&D investment and economic growth over the period 1953-2009. This is achieved by considering a series of counterfactual experiments. In the \u2026rst experiment, the corporate income tax rate is \u2026xed at its 1953 value, so that p;t = 0:52; for all t 0: All other parameters are the same as in the benchmark economy. In the second experiment, the R&D subsidy rate is \u2026xed at its 1953 value, so that d;t = 0:0007; for all t 0: The time paths of the combined subsidy rate in these two experiments are shown in Figure 10. In the third experiment, the share of government basic research spending in total R&D expenditures is \u2026xed at its 1953 value, so that $ t = 0:0725; for all t 0: In the fourth experiment, we assume that high-skilled and low-skilled employment have been growing at the same rate since 1953. As a result, the employment share of high-skilled workers has remained constant since 1953, i.e., t = 0:0079; for all t 0: We have also performed three other experiments in which the tax rates on consumption, labor income and capital income are \u2026xed at their 1953 values. In terms of R&D investment and economic growth, these counterfactual scenarios produce essentially the same results as the benchmark model. 52 Hence, we do not report these results here. Figure 11 shows the R&D investment rates generated by the economy in Experiment 1, along with the benchmark results and the actual data. Fixing the corporate income tax rate at 52 percent has two opposing e\u00a4ects on R&D investment. On one hand, higher tax rates lower the (after-tax) pro\u2026ts that can be extracted from an improved product, and thereby lower the \u2026rm's incentive to innovate. Holding other factors constant, this will lower the R&D investment rate in every period. On the other hand, the combined subsidy rates after 1986 are now substantially higher than those in the benchmark model (see Figure 10). This induces a strong increase in R&D investment from 1986 onward which more than o\u00a4sets the reduction brought by the \u2026rst e\u00a4ect. Thus, for the period 1986-2009, the R&D investment rates in Experiment 1 are actually higher than in the benchmark model. Note that without the tax cut in 1987, the model no longer predicts an abrupt fall in R&D investment rate in this year. Figure 12 shows the R&D investment rates generated by the economy in Experiment 2. For the period prior 1981, the combined subsidy rates in this experiment are the same as in the benchmark model. Thus, the two sets of results coincide before 1981. For the period 1981-2009, the combined subsidy rates in Experiment 2 are lower than in the benchmark model. As a result, the R&D investment rates in Experiment 2 are also lower than in the benchmark model over this time period. Note that without the increase in R&D tax credit in 1981 and 1990, the model no longer predicts a sharp increase in R&D investment rate in these two years. While changes in corporate income tax and R&D subsidy have direct impact on the \u2026rms' incentive to innovate and hence their demand for high-skilled workers, these policy changes have no e\u00a4ect on the supply of these workers. In the current framework, the equilibrium quantity of labor input in private R&D is determined by (1 $ t ) N H;t in every period t: The allocation of this input across \u2026rms is determined by the function M;t ( ) as speci\u2026ed in Proposition 2. Neither (1 $ t ) N H;t nor M;t ( ) is a\u00a4ected by the corporate income tax rate and the R&D subsidy rate. Consequently, these policy instruments have no e\u00a4ect on the equilibrium dynamics of X t and Q t , and no e\u00a4ect on economic growth in both the short run and the long run. These \u2026ndings are summarized in the second and third columns of Table 5. This also means that the results in Figures 11 and 12 are merely re \u2021ecting the e\u00a4ects of these policy instruments on the wage rate of high-skilled workers. In the third experiment, the share of government basic research spending in total R&D expenditures ($ t ) is \u2026xed at its 1953 value. As shown in Figure 8, this share has increased substantially since 1960. Thus, for most part of the transition period, the economy in Experiment 3 has a much smaller scale of basic research than in the benchmark economy. As a result of this, the average growth rate of X t in Experiment 3 is about 44 percent lower than in the benchmark model (see the fourth column of Table 5). This in turn reduces the growth rates of TFP and per-worker output by 25.5 percent and 14.7 percent, respectively. Second, we have expressed all the values in Figure 13 as ratios to the benchmark results. 53 Since the values of N H;t in this experiment are the same as in the benchmark model, the quantity changes depicted in Figure 13 are entirely due to changes in (1 $ t ) : A reduction in $ t means that a larger fraction of high-skilled workers are now allocated to quality improvement research. Thus, holding other things constant, these quantity changes will lead to higher levels of private R&D spending and lower growth rates of fundamental knowledge. The e\u00a4ects on w H;t are threefold: First, a reduction in $ t increases the supply of high-skilled workers in the private sector, which pushes down the equilibrium wage rate. Second, since fundamental knowledge is conducive to the e\u00a2ciency of private R&D, a reduction in the growth rate of X t will lower the net gain from an improved product, and thereby lower the \u2026rms' demand for high-skilled workers. Finally, a reduction in $ t will also a\u00a4ect private R&D through the equilibrium interest rate. This happens because fundamental knowledge is also conducive to \u2026rm productivity. Thus, a slowdown in the accumulation of fundamental knowledge will have a negative impact on the marginal product of physical capital. For this reason, the equilibrium interest rates in Experiment 3 are much lower than in the benchmark model (see Figure 14). From an innovating \u2026rm's perspective, this means the pro\u2026t stream generated by an improved product is now discounted at lower rates. This leads to a higher net gain from quality improvement research, and thereby encourages the demand for researchers. The third e\u00a4ect is the reason why the values of w H;t in Experiment 3 are higher than in the benchmark model during the early stage of the transition period. Eventually, the \u2026rst two e\u00a4ects dominate and depress the value of w H;t : In the fourth experiment, we assume that high-skilled and low-skilled employment have been growing at the same rate since 1953. As suggested by Figure 6, this means the economy in Experiment 4 has a much smaller number of researchers than in the benchmark economy. As shown in the \u2026fth column of Table   5, the reduction in high-skilled labor has a detrimental impact on research activities and technological progress. Speci\u2026cally, the average growth rates of X t and Q t in Experiment 4 are 52.7 percent and 54.4 percent lower than in the benchmark model. These together reduce the growth rates of TFP and perworker output by 45.7 percent and 33.1 percent, respectively. Figure 15 shows that reducing the number of researchers will have a strong positive impact on their wage rate. This is mainly due to a combination of reduced supply and lower values of interest rate (see Figure 14). These price changes partly o\u00a4set the reduction in private R&D spending brought by the quantity changes."}, {"section_title": "Long-run Equilibrium", "text": "In this subsection, we focus on the long-run balanced-growth equilibrium of our model and perform two sets of comparative statics exercises.

In each of these equilibria, the parameters f ; ; g are recalibrated so that three of the targeted statistics (the share of labor income in total output, real interest rate and capital-output ratio) are the same as in the benchmark model. All other parameters are \u2026xed at their benchmark values. In the second exercise, we examine how changes in f ; %; g would a\u00a4ect the benchmark results. To achieve this, we compute a series of long-run equilibria, each involves changing the value of one of these parameters. The values of f ; ; g are again recalibrated in each case. All other parameters (including $ ) are \u2026xed at their benchmark values. The results of the \u2026rst exercise are shown in Figures 16a and 16b. The main message of our \u2026ndings is clear: By expanding the scale of publicly \u2026nanced basic research, the government can e\u00a4ectively promote total R&D investment and long-term economic growth. For instance, increasing $ from its benchmark value (13.86 percent) to 20 percent will raise the R&D investment rate from 2.08 percent to 2.52 percent and the long-run growth rate from 1.56 percent to 2.31 percent. On the other hand, if we completely eliminate government-\u2026nanced basic research (by setting $ = 0), then the long-run growth rate will drop to 0.53 percent. This result suggests that about two-thirds of the long-term economic growth in our benchmark model is originated from basic research. Figure 16b shows that private R&D investment also increases as $ increases. This result, however, depends crucially on our treatment of the long-run interest rate. If the long-run interest rate is allowed to vary, then expanding the scale of government-\u2026nanced basic research will lower private R&D investment. This happens because an increase in $ will drive up the long-run interest rate. For reasons explained earlier, such an increase will lower the equilibrium wage rate for high-skilled workers and thereby lower private R&D spending. The results of the second exercise are reported in Table 6. First, changing the value of (which is the elasticity of TFP with respect to fundamental knowledge) has no e\u00a4ect on the growth rates of X t and Q t : This happens because this parameter does not appear in equations (26) and (41) which capture the basic and non-basic research processes. Increasing this parameter value, however, will enhance the bene\u2026ts of fundamental knowledge on \u2026rm productivity. Thus, holding other things constant, a higher value of will increase TFP growth and long-term economic growth. Second, increasing the value of % will enhance the bene\u2026ts of fundamental knowledge on basic and non-basic research. This has the e\u00a4ect of encouraging private R&D investment and stimulating the growth of X t and Q t : Overall, the results in Table 6 suggest that our benchmark model is not very sensitive to changes in and %: Finally, we consider the e\u00a4ects of changing the value of : This parameter has two roles in our model. First, it determines the elasticity of substitution between any two types of intermediate inputs in the production of \u2026nal goods. Second, it determines the extent of markup over the cost of producing intermediate goods. In the baseline parameterization, is set equal to 0:9091 which implies a ten percent markup rate: In the comparative statics exercise, we consider two alternative values: = 0:9524 which implies a markup rate of \u2026ve percent, and = 0:8696 which implies a markup rate of \u2026fteen percent. Reducing the value of has two main e\u00a4ects. First, by increasing the markup rate and the monopoly pro\u2026ts from an improved product, such a reduction will encourage private R&D investment. Second, reducing the value of will increase the complementarity between di\u00a4erent types of intermediate inputs. Holding other factors constant, this will induce a redistribution of high-skilled labor from high-quality \u2026rms to low-quality ones. 54 Such a redistribution will promote the growth rate of Q t ; which will in turn lead to a faster growth rate of TFP and per-worker output. Because of these two e\u00a4ects, our benchmark model is rather sensitive to changes in :"}, {"section_title": "Welfare Analysis", "text": "We now turn to the e\u00a4ects of government basic research spending on consumer welfare. Suppose the model economy is initially in the benchmark long-run balanced-growth equilibrium with $ 0 = 0:1386 and 0 = 0:0156 (the status quo). Suppose now the government wants to achieve a long-term growth target 1 > 0 by permanently increasing the scale of basic research from $ 0 to $ 1 : After the new policy is announced and implemented, the economy gradually converges to a new long-run balanced-growth 5 4 As shown in Proposition 2, the allocation of high-skilled labor across \u2026rms is determined by M;t (q) = (1 $t) NH;t (q=Qt) 1 : Note that the value of = (1 ) decreases as decreases. For the values of that we have considered, = (1 ) > 1: Thus, decreasing the value of will raise the value of M;t (q) for q < Qt and reduce the value of M;t (q) for q > Qt: In other words, high-skilled workers are redistributed from high-quality \u2026rms to low-quality ones. equilibrium with $ 1 and 1 : The task at hand is to quantify the welfare e\u00a4ects induced by this policy change. This is achieved by constructing a consumption-equivalent measure of welfare changes along the line of Lucas (1987). Formally, let fc s;t g 1 t=0 be the equilibrium consumption sequence for a type-s consumer in the status quo, and let fe c s;t ($ 1 )g 1 t=0 be the equilibrium consumption sequence under the new policy. Time 0 in here refers to the period when the new policy is announced and implemented. Our welfare measure z s ($ 1 ) is de\u2026ned according to The intuition behind this measure is as follows. Suppose the type-s household is better o\u00a4 under the new policy, so that In this case, the value of z s ($ 1 ) is greater than one. Equation 48 Following our discussion in the previous sections, we know that changes in the value of $ will induce signi\u2026cant changes in the equilibrium interest rate, which will in turn a\u00a4ect the equilibrium wage rate for high-skilled workers. To highlight the welfare e\u00a4ects of these changes, we compute our welfare measures under two di\u00a4erent scenarios. In the \u2026rst scenario, all parameters except $ are \u2026xed at their benchmark values. In particular, the employment growth rates and all other exogenous policy variables are assumed to be constant over time and take the same values as in the benchmark model. In the second scenario, the increase in $ is accompanied by a simultaneous reduction in the capital income tax rate a at time t = 0: The new value of a is chosen so that the real interest rate in the new long-run equilibrium is the same as in the benchmark model (i.e., 8 percent). All other parameters are \u2026xed at their benchmark values. The results of these exercises are reported in Table 7. The \u2026rst two columns of this table show the long-term growth target and the required value of $ 1 : The third, fourth and \u2026fth columns show some properties of the new long-run equilibrium. The last two columns show the consumption-equivalent measures of welfare changes. Panel A reports the results obtained when a is \u2026xed at its benchmark value. Panel B reports the results obtained when a is adjusted so that the long-run interest rate is maintained at percent. In both scenarios, increasing the value of $ creates signi\u2026cant welfare gains for both types of consumers. However, the magnitude of these gains (especially for the high-skilled workers) depend crucially on our treatment of the long-run interest rate. In the \u2026rst scenario, an increase in $ will drive up the equilibrium real interest rate which a\u00a4ect negatively the wage rate for high-skilled workers. As a result of this, the ratio between w H;t and w L;t declines initially along the transition path. This explains why the welfare gains for high-skilled consumers are slightly less than those for the low-skilled consumers in Panel A. In the second scenario, the negative price changes due to the increase in interest rate are mitigated. As a result, the ratio between w H;t and w L;t is monotonically increasing along the transition path, and the values of z H ($ 1 ) are much higher than those of z L ($ 1 ) in Panel B."}, {"section_title": "Concluding Remarks", "text": "In this paper, we have developed an endogenous growth model which takes into account both public and private R&D investment, and the di\u00a4erences between basic and non-basic research. In particular, the present study represents one of the few attempts to explore the signi\u2026cance of basic research in a dynamic general equilibrium model. Our results suggest that the accumulation of fundamental knowledge is an important contributing factor to U.S. economic growth. In terms of policy implications, this means government spending on basic research is a powerful policy instrument to promote economic growth. Two other important \u2026ndings also emerged from the analysis. First, subsidizing private R&D investment (either through tax exemption or tax credit) has no e\u00a4ect on economic growth in both the short run and the long run. Second, the rapid increase in the number of scientists and engineers in the past several decades has a major contribution to U.S. economic growth. Taken together, these two results suggest that it is more important to stimulate the supply of researchers than to stimulate the demand for them. Since the supply of researchers is often a\u00a4ected by other government policies (such as immigration policies and education policies), our results suggest that these policies may also be important in explaining R&D investment and economic growth. One direction of future research is to examine these issues using the model developed in this study.        1953 1958 1963 1968 1973 1978 1983 1988 1993 1998 2003 2008 1953 1958 1963 1968 1973 1978 1983 1988 1993 1998 2003 2008 1953 1958 1963 1968 1973 1978 1983 1988 1993 1998 2003 2008 1953 1958 1963 1968 1973 1978 1983 1988 1993 1998 2003 2008 1953 1958 1963 1968 1973 1978 1983 1988 1993 1998 2003 2008 1953 1958 1963 1968 1973 1978 1983 1988 1993 1998 2003 2008 1953 1958 1963 1968 1973 1978 1983 1988 1993 1998 2003 2008 1953 1958 1963 1968 1973 1978 1983 1988 1993 1998 2003 2008 1953 1958 1963 1968 1973 1978 1983 1988 1993 1998 2003 1953 1958 1963 1968 1973 1978 1983 1988 1993 1998 2003 2008 Year  1953 1958 1963 1968 1973 1978 1983 1988 1993 1998 2003 2008 2 1953 1958 1963 1968 1973 1978 1983 1988 1993 1998 2003 2008 1953 1958 1963 1968 1973 1978 1983 1988 1993 1998 2003 2008 4 1953 1958 1963 1968 1973 1978 1983 1988 1993 1998 2003 "}, {"section_title": "Production in Intermediate-Goods Sector", "text": "The minimum cost required to produce M 0 units of intermediate good (j; !) can be obtained by solving the problem below: The solution of this problem involves a pair of factor demand functions: and a linear cost function.
