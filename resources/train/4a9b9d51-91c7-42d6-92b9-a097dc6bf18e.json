[{"section_title": "", "text": "The Beginning Postsecondary Students (BPS) study followed a group of students who began their postsecondary educational careers during academic year 1989-90. The follow-up was conducted in the spring of 1992. A major focus of this BPS follow-up was the persistence and degree attainment of these beginners. Specifically, these beginners could have left postsecondary education during the first year (by June 1990), during the second year (between July 1990 and June 1991), after the second year (after June 1991), or they could have been still enrolled at the time of the follow-up. Some of the leaverL may have attained degrees (especially those in shorter term vocational programs). Based on spring 1992 information, the group of beginners during the July 1989 through June 1990 period was initially categorized as having attained if any certificate, license, or degree had been awarded. The group who had not attained was subsequently categorized as still enrolled if at the time of the follow-up they reported an enrollment. The group who was not still enrolled was subsequently sorted into three exhaustive categories based on when they left postsecondary education for the last time. An analysis of these data found the following: As expected, many of the students initially enrolled in institutions offering programs of less than 4-year durations were no longer enrolled. Only four (4) percent of students who initially enrolled in private for-profit institutions were still enrolled. Low enrollment rates were also evident for students initially enrolled in public less-than-2-year institutions (8 percent) and for students initially enrolled in private not-for-profit less-than-4-year institutions (14 percent). For the public 2-year sector, where enrollments are mixed between academic and vocational programs, about one-third (32 percent) of the beginners were still enrolled. About two-thirds of the beginners in 4-year institutions were still enrolled as of spring 1992. The first-year dropout rates were higher in public 4-year institutions than in private not-for-profit 4-year institutions (13 vs. 10 percent). Females were less likely than males to leave postsecondary education during their first year (19 vs. 23 percent). Asians were most likely to still be enrolled as of spring 1992, when 63 percent of Asians were still enrolled. In comparison, 41 percent of whites were still enrolled. iii  Table 3.--Persistence and attainment percentages by spring 1992 for private not-for-profit 4-year students who began in AY 1989-90 3   Table 4.--Persistence and attainment percentages by spring 1992 for public 2-year students who began in AY 1989-90 4 Table 5.--Persistence and attainment percentages by spring 1992 for private riot-for profit less-than-4-year students who began in AY 1989-90 Table 6.--Persistence and attainment percentages by spring 1992 for public less-than-2-year students who began in AY 1989-90       Survey Content, The Beginning Postsecondary Students 1990/92 (BPS:90/92) longitudinal survey followed students identified in the 1990 Nacional Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:90) as potential first-time entrants in postsecondary education. The 1992 followup identified tho.-e who were first-time beginning (FTB) students from the academic year 1989-90. The CATI (computer assisted telephone interview) interview obtained information concerning enrollment, program completion, education financing, employment, and family formation after the NPSAS:90 survey; expectations for graduate school; participation in additional education (provided by an employer or other non-postsecondary provider); family income and expenditures; goals and aspirations; and community service. The data derived from this survey permit a variety of analyses concerning postsecondary persistence and completion, entry into the work force, and community participation. BPS data are made available in two formats: public use Data Analysis Systems and restricted use files. Each DAS contains numerous variables relevant to a particular research topic, but not all data available in the full BPS system. Thus, the DAS used to generate this Ed-Tab contains all variables reported in the tab, but is not limited to those variables. The DAS used to generate this ED Tab is available on compact disk (contact Arlie Gordon, 202 219-1367). 2."}, {"section_title": "Target Population", "text": "The target population is all students who entered postsecondary education for the first time in academic year 1989-90. Students who were still enrolled in high school were not eligible for NPSAS, nor BPS. Similarly, institutions offering only corresnondence courses, institutions enrolling only their own employees, and US service academies were not eligible for NPSAS or BPS. Students eligible for BPS were identified in two stages. The first stage involved selection for the NPSAS:90 sample, identified to be representative of all students enrolled in postsecondary education between July 1, 1989 and June 30, 1990'. Of the NPSAS:90 sample, those who were identified as being first-time enrollees were eligible for BPS and retained in the 1992 interview. BPS data are nationally representative by institution level and control, but like NPSAS, are not representative at the state level."}, {"section_title": "3.", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sample Design", "text": "A data base of -1,700 NPSAS:90 participants that was believed to contain all possible first-time beginning students (FTBs) in the NPSAS:90 sample was used as the basis for selecting the BPS:90/92 sample. The initial set of 11,700 potential FTBs contained 10,566 students who had been identified as probable undergraduate students, 333 students who had been identified as probable first-professional students, and 801 students who had been identified as probable graduate students. (Undergraduates in vocational programs sometimes consider themselves as being in their first level professional program, and if they have completed the program, they consider themselves graduates of that program. This is not the same as being in First-Professional programs such as Medicine or Dentistry, nor have they graduated from a baccalaureate level program. Hence, some students are improperly classified. Other non-FTB students were included as part of the 'For a complete description of the NPSAS:90 sample design and methodology, see Shepherd, Jane and Andrew G.

Considerable effort was directed toward ensuring that the sample for BPS:90/92 contained appropriate members. Since the preliminary sample contained fairly large numbers of individuals with questionable status as FTBs. Non-FTBs were identified in almost every phase of the data collection process. A small number of non-FTBs were identified in the various locating activities.

Mailouts to parents of all students identified through NPSAS as potential FTBs introduced to the BPS survey and requested current locating information for the potential respondents. In January 1992, information packets were mailed to the 10,724 students considered to be possible FTBs. Data collection for BPS:90/92 took place between late April and the end of August 1992. Data was collected by Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI)."}, {"section_title": "5.", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Response Rates and Weighting", "text": "Since the BPS:90/92 is a longitudinal follow-up of the first-time, beginning (FTB) students identified in the 1990 NPSAS, the initial weights for the BPS sample were the final analysis weights for NPSAS:90. Thus, the first part of this section briefly reviews the NPSAS:90 weights. The next part discusses development of weight adjustment cells for the BPS that compensate for the potential bias due to ineligibility and nonresponse among the 11,700 potential FTB students that formed the basis for the BPS sample. The remaining parts of this section discuss the nonresponse compensation procedures that have been implemented for BPS:90/92. ."}, {"section_title": "5.1", "text": "Weighting for NPSAS:90 The initial sampling weight for each student selected for NPSAS:90 was based on the students overall probability of selection. The probability of selection accounted for the probability of selecting the institution, subsampling the institutions and requesting lists of students for the four time points in the academic year, and selecting students from the lists obtained. A multiplicity adjustment was incorporated into the weight for students that attended more than one institution during the 1989-90 academic year. Weight adjustments were implemented to compensate for nonresponse of sample institutions to the request for student lists, for nonresponse of institutions in the student record abstractions, and for nonresponse by the students themselves in the telephone survey. The final step in the weight adjustment process was a post-stratification adjustment based on numbers of Pell grant recipients. This overview of the analysis weights for NPSAS:90 is based on the final methodology report, to which the reader is referred for additional details (U.S. Department of Education, 1992). As an example, one parent contacted during locating indicated, \"My son is now a practicing Dentist in Denver, would you also like his office number.\" The locator collected all information, and project staff determined that it was not feasible for an FTB in 1989 to complete all undergraduate and Dental school in two and a half years."}, {"section_title": "5.2", "text": "Defining Weight Adjustment Cells NPSAS:90 yielded an initial set of 11,700 potential FTBs, which contained 10,566 students who had been selected as undergraduate students, 333 students who had been selected as first-professional students, and 801 students who had been selected as graduate students, as discussed in section 3. The fielded BPS:90/92 sample consisted of the 10,624 members. Response and eligibility status were defined for each of the 10,624 members of the fielded BPS sample as shown in Table 5.1. Sample-based adjustment cell weighting was used to compensate for BPS nonresponse and ineligibility. Population-based adjustment cell weighting was not proposed because there were no external population totals for first-time, beginning (FTB) students that were believed to be more accurate than the BPS estimates. BPS sample members were classified as eligible if they were found to satisfy all the following conditions: (1) first-time, beginning student during the 1989-90 academic year, (2) eligible for NPSAS:90 (i.e., enrolled in a course for credit in a qualifying postsecondary institution during the 1989-90 academic year), not deceased at the time of the 1992 BPS follow-up survey. Any student who was found to not satisfy any one of the above conditions was classified as ineligible for BPS. Those students for whom the eligibility determination process could not be completed were classified as having undetermined eligibility status. BPS sample members were classified as respondents if they completed as least one question beyond those needed to determine eligibility status. Because tracing students and determining their eligibility for BPS was a complex process and because the response rule was quite liberal, most of the BPS nonrespondents were sample students whose eligibility status could not be determined. The number of students with known eligibility status at the conclusion of BPS data collection (eligible or ineligible in Table 5.1) was 9,077. Thus, the unweighted percent of the BPS sample who were respondents regarding eligibility determination is 85.4 percent (9,077 out of 10,624). The weighted percent responding at this phase of data collection (i.e., the estimated percent of the population represented by the sample of 10,624 students for whom eligibility could be determined using the BPS procedures) is 85.8 percent. Both the weighted and unweighted percentage of respondents among the sample students known to be eligible for BPS are 99.7 percent (6,525 out of 6,543). Therefore, the weighted and unweighted BPS response rates (products of the above response rates for eligibility determination and BPS interviewing) are 85.5 percent and 85.2 percent, respectively. Since nonresponse occurs primarily at the stage of eligibility determination, that was the focus of the nonresponse adjustments. Because BPS nonresponse occurs at two stages determination of eligibility and survey response among eligibles weight adjustments for nonresponse were implemented in two corresponding stages. Since over 99 percent of the students who were determined to be eligible were also classified as respondents, the adjustment for nonresponse among students known to be eligible was a single overall weight adjustment. Weight adjustment classes were used to compensate for nonresponse regarding the determination of eligibility. The NPSAS:90 variables considered for forming the nonresponse adjustment cells are listed in Table 5.2. The distribution of percent eligible was first examined for each variable separately. All weight adjustment cells were formed by taking the weight adjustment cells formed by crossing BPSSTRA2 and typical age, and subdividing them by other variables when there were differences of about five percent or more in eligibility rates, subject to the requirement that each final weight adjustment cell must contain approximately 30 or more students with known eligibility status. In addition, most weighting classes were defined to contain only institutions with a single level of control because public, private, and proprietary institutions will often define separate analysis domains. This information was used to develop the final weight adjustment cells (see the sample design report for further information).

The variability introduced by the weight adjustment process is, therefore, reflected in the 35 sets of replicate weights and, hence, would be included in replication-method variance estimates based upon them."}, {"section_title": "References", "text": "Little, R.
