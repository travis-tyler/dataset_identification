The \u03b54-allele of apolipoprotein E (ApoE \u03b54), female sex, and older age are well-known risk factors for AD. It is unclear how these risk factors affect the CSF biomarkers in patients with AD. Aim: The objective of this study was to investigate the associations of ApoE \u03b54, sex, and age with CSF biomarker levels in a unicenter sample of patients with AD that includes a high proportion of patients with early-onset AD (EOAD). Methods: The CSF levels of amyloid-\u03b2 1-42 (A\u03b21-42) and total-tau of 117 subjects with mild to moderate AD (55 late-onset AD and 62 EOAD) were assessed. All subjects underwent ApoE genotyping, clinical evaluation, comprehensive neuropsychological assessments, and neuroimaging. Associations between CSF biomarker levels, ApoE \u03b54 allele frequency, age, and sex were evaluated. Results: In the whole patient sample and in the late-onset AD subgroup \u03b54 homozygous subjects had significantly lower CSF A\u03b21-42 levels compared with \u03b54 heterozygous subjects and \u03b54 noncarriers.

Recently published diagnostic algorithms for AD enable its diagnosis independently of its symptoms, based on biomarkers, for instance on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-\u03b2 1-42 (A\u03b21-42) and tau proteins, which improve the diagnostic accuracy for AD. CSF levels of totaltau (t-tau) are typically elevated in AD and are associated with neuronal and axonal damage. 1 CSF levels of A\u03b21-42 are reduced in AD and reflect the higher amyloid plaque burden in the brain. 2, 3 Consistent with histopathological findings, CSF chemistry studies have identified that reductions of A\u03b21-42 occurs several years before symptom onset.

Homozygous \u03b54-subjects had significantly lower CSF A\u03b21-42 levels compared to heterozygous \u03b54-carriers and \u03b54 noncarriers, suggesting a dose-dependent effect of ApoE \u03b54 on CSF A\u03b21-42 levels. Neither sex nor age or severity of dementia as measured by MMSE was significantly associated with CSF A\u03b21-42 levels. No significant association was detected between ApoE \u03b54 and CSF t-tau-levels.\nAs early as 1993, genetic analyses identified ApoE \u03b54 as the major risk factor for AD. 6 Since then, ApoE has been established as the most important susceptibility gene for late-onset sporadic AD. 17 The APoE \u03b54 isoform appears to enhance amyloid-\u03b2 production and cerebral plaque deposition and seems to alleviate the clearance of amyloid-\u03b2 (for a detailed review, see Yu et al 18 ) . In line with these findings, several studies have found a dose effect of ApoE \u03b54 on CSF A\u03b21-42 levels not only in AD patients but also in subjects with mild cognitive impairment and cognitively healthy controls: low CSF levels of A\u03b21-42, a marker of amyloid-\u03b2 plaque load, are linked to the presence of ApoE \u03b54. For example, Vemuri et al found a clear ApoE \u03b54 dose effect on CSF A\u03b21-42 levels in 98 patients with AD from an Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. 9 A recent multicenter study by Lautner et al which included 309 patients with AD (mean age 77 years) showed that ApoE \u03b54 carriers had lower CSF A\u03b21-42 levels compared to noncarriers in a dose-dependent manner. 8 It is still under debate whether the association of low CSF A\u03b21-42 levels with the presence of ApoE \u03b54 should be considered for the definition of cutoff levels of CSF A\u03b21-42 when using them as a biomarker for AD. Some studies suggest that the ApoE genotype should be taken into account; others, however, conclude that the cutoff level for CSF A\u03b21-42 should be the same for all ApoE genotypes. 19 It is important to highlight, that thus far, large studies have overlooked the association between ApoE polymorphism and CSF biomarker levels focusing only on LOAD. This is surprising because the pathophysiology, particularly with regard to amyloid-\u03b2 production and clearance, appears to differ between LOAD and (not only familial but also) sporadic EOAD. 11, 12, 20 Therefore, this study is the first to examine the association of ApoE \u03b54 with CSF biomarker levels specifically in patients with EOAD and find that in EOAD -in contrast to LOAD and the whole patient group -the ApoE \u03b54 allele frequency was not significantly associated with CSF A\u03b21-42 levels. However, given the relatively small sample of patients with EOAD in the present study, this finding needs to be investigated further in larger studies.\nApoE \u03b54 is neurotoxic and stimulates tau phosphorylation, leading to neurofibrillary tangles. It appears to affect tau neuropathological changes in AD brains and in animal models. 18 Human studies of the relationship between ApoE \u03b54 and cerebral tau, however, showed contradictory results. 21 Nonetheless, several studies found that ApoE \u03b54 carriers have higher CSF t-tau levels than noncarriers. 9 In the present study, "}, {"section_title": "3109", "text": "Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease significant effects of the ApoE \u03b54 dose on CSF t-tau levels were not detected. Our findings reveal that neither sex nor age alone appeared to influence CSF levels of A\u03b21-42 and t-tau. While it is well established that, alike ApoE \u03b54, female sex and older age are risk factors for AD, the study results are inconclusive with regard to the effect of female sex or higher age on CSF biomarker levels. For example, an ADNI study of 144 AD patients showed that women and ApoE \u03b54 carriers experience higher rates of cognitive decline; however, in this study no significant effects of sex on CSF levels of A\u03b21-42 and t-tau were detected. 22 On the contrary, a meta-analysis reported an interaction between sex and ApoE with women having a higher \u03b54-associated risk of AD than men. 10 In a recent large study of 2,375 Swedish AD subjects, logistic regression models revealed that female sex increased the risk of having pathologic CSF biomarker levels (decreased A\u03b21-42, increased t-tau and phospho-tau). In this model, age had no effect on the likelihood of pathologic biomarkers. ApoE genotypes were not taken into account in this study. 23 In all 60% of the patients in our study carried at least one ApoE \u03b54 allele. Approximately 18% were homozygous \u03b54-carriers. The reasons for the high proportion of \u03b54 carriers in our sample can only be speculated. The patients included in the study had extensive diagnosis including detailed neuropsychology, CSF analysis, structural imaging in all and 61% of the patients had FDG-PET-imaging. Therefore, the probability of misdiagnoses is extremely low and thus a \"pure\" Alzheimer cohort might explain higher ApoE \u03b54 rates than usual.\nThe present study has some limitations: first and most important, the patient sample is relatively small. Statistical power is limited with respect to analyses of CSF biomarkers in relation to a small sample of patients that homozygous ApoE \u03b54 carriers. The unicenter design with patients from one specialized memory clinic may limit the generalization of the results to the whole population of patients with AD. However, this study reflects the real-life practice in a specialized memory clinic. Furthermore, a unicenter study allows the use of harmonized procedures for the measurement of CSF biomarkers, avoiding assay-related preanalytical and analytical factors between laboratory variability. The strengths of the study lie in its detailed cognitive assessment protocol and careful diagnostic ascertainment. The diagnoses were performed by a trained team of psychiatrists and neuropsychologists highly specialized in cognitive disorders who used all available clinical and technical data, including FDG-PET scans in 61% of patients.
