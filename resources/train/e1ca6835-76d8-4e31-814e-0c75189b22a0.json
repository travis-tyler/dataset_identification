However, limited data are available on the origins and number of introductions of COVID-19 into the country. We sequenced the causative agent of COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), from 43 clinical samples we collected, along with another 79 genome sequences available from Colombia. We investigated the emergence and importation routes for SARS-CoV-2 into Colombia by using epidemiologic, historical air travel, and phylogenetic observations. Our study provides evidence of multiple introductions, mostly from Europe, and documents >12 lineages. Phylogenetic findings validate the lineage diversity, support multiple importation events, and demonstrate the evolutionary relationship of epidemiologically linked transmission chains. Our results reconstruct the early evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2 in Colombia and highlight the advantages of genome sequencing to complement COVID-19 outbreak investigations. public databases, mainly GISAID (https://www. gisaid.org). SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus with an estimated substitution rate of 0.8-1.1 \u00d7 10 -3 substitutions/site/year (S.

Worobey et al., unpub. data, https:// www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.21.10932 2v1), which means it rapidly evolves as it is transmitted. The availability of SARS-CoV-2 genomes enabled us to detect a rapidly generating variation, demonstrating that genomic epidemiology is a powerful approach for characterizing the outbreak (14) . Genomic epidemiology relies on phylogenetic analysis and has enabled researchers across the world to detect SARS-CoV-2 emergence in humans, reveal the importation and local transmission chains not detected by travel history and traditional contact-tracing strategies, and trace the geographic spread and prevalence of strains bearing specific mutations of epidemiologic relevance (15) (16) (17) "}, {"section_title": "Sample Collection and Preparation", "text": "Colombia is made up of 32 departments, which are groups of municipalities, and a capital district.

The downsampling strategies were as follows: retaining several sequences per region, when possible, equal to the number of sequences available for Colombia; or retaining 50 sequences per region and the total number of sequences from Colombia, which was the most even sampling per region for the South America-focused subsample."}, {"section_title": "Potential Routes of SARS-CoV-2 Importation into Colombia", "text": "We inferred the relative proportion of expected SARS-CoV-2 importations per country by considering COVID-19 incidence per number of international air passengers arriving in Colombia and the available flight travel.

For instance, the number of documented lineages was highly correlated with the availability of samples (Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient [PPMCC] = 0.72; p<0.001) and uncorrelated with the number of local cases (PPMCC = 0.35; p = 0.049). We noted 5 different lineages in the departments of Valle del Cauca and Antioquia and 3 different lineages in Cundinamarca; these departments have the most populated capitals and we had more samples from them ( Figure 2, panel B) . We observed a moderate positive correlation between the number of lineages documented in a department and the number of imported cases (PPMCC = 0.51; p = 0.002)."}, {"section_title": "Molecular Evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in Colombia", "text": "We identified 133 single-nucleotide variants (NVs) by using the full genome sequences from Colombia and the reference sequence (GenBank accession no. NC_045512.2). Most NVs (131; 98.5%) fell into the coding region, and 1 NV was identified at each noncoding end. Among NVs in coding sites, 71 (54.2%) led to nonsynonymous substitutions. Most NVs (92/133) were unique to a sequence. Among the shared NVs, 38/41 were associated with a specific lineage (Appendix 1 Tables 3, 4 ). These observations suggest that the substitutions are not laboratory-specific and most likely the outcome of in situ evolution, shared ancestry, or both (Appendix 2).\nIn our study, among sequences with complete metadata, 90% (108/120) of sequences from Colombia displayed an amino acid change in region D614G, and the remaining 10% (12 sequences) displayed a change in region D614 (Appendix 1 Table 4 ). G614 has been associated with higher infectivity (L. Zhang et al., unpub data, https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/ 2020.06.12.148726v1) and greater transmissibility with no effects on disease severity outcomes (46; E.M. Volz et al., unpub data, https://www.medrxiv.org/con tent/10.1101/2020.07.31.20166082v2). All G614 sequences also carried mutations that segregate together as described in B. Korber et al. (47) ; we identified the nucleotide substitution C241T at 5\u2032-UTR; the synonymous substitution C3037T at open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab), the nonstructural protein 3 encoding-gene; and a change in P4715L aa position in ORF1ab, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase encoding gene. The presence of these and other mutations can be phenotypically and epidemiologically relevant and warrant further monitoring.\nMost patients from Colombia for whom genomic sequences were available were symptomatic (n = 90); 59.6% had cough and fever and the others had >1 symptom; 10 died, 70% of whom had underlying conditions (Appendix 1 Table 1 ).

Asia was the inferred ancestral state at the root. Both these observations are in line with the known epidemiology of the pandemic. A root-to-tip regression of genetic distance against sampling time evidenced consistent temporal signal in the sequence data (Figure 3, panel B) . The isolates from Colombia were interspersed among the isolates from other countries, suggesting multiple introductions ( Figure  3, panels A, C) . However, considerable phylogenetic uncertainty appears along the tree and the fine-grained relationships of the isolates from Colombia could not be resolved with confidence (Appendix 2 Figure 1) .\nPhylogenetic uncertainty and uneven sampling made the quantification of the number of introductions 2858 Emerging Infectious Diseases \u2022 www.cdc.gov/eid \u2022 Vol. 26, No. 12, December 2020 During January-March 2020, a total of 7 cities in Colombia received 1,593,211 international passengers from 14 countries. Bogot\u00e1 was the most concentrated city for flights, receiving around 77% of passengers; other cities included Medell\u00edn with 11%, Cartagena with 6%, and Cali with 4% of passengers. In total, 35% of international passengers started their journeys in the United States, 17% in Mexico, and 12% in Chile. However, we estimate 87% of all imported CO-VID-19 cases in Colombia came from Europe, 9.5% from North America, and 3.4% from South America. When stratified by country, the primary source of importation was Spain, which had 71.4% of imported cases; the United States had 8.4%, Germany had 8%, and France had 3.4% (Appendix 2 Figure 2 ). Our data show most (65.2%) COVID-19 cases were among travelers arriving in Bogot\u00e1; 20% were among those arriving in Medell\u00edn, and 9% among those arriving in Cali. We estimate that the Spain-Bogot\u00e1 route carried 42% of the total imported cases.\nSince the first COVID-19 case was identified in Colombia on February 26, 2020, contact-tracing efforts had been put in place. We obtained multiple sequences from 7 distinct early epidemiologically linked transmission chains (Appendix 1 Table 1 ) and mapped these data into the phylogeny (Figure 3 , panel C). All but 1 set of sequences did not group, but it appeared very close in the tree. These data underscore the potential utility of genomic epidemiology to link persons with incomplete information, such as cases that are disconnected due to intermediate asymptomatic carriers, and complement outbreak transmission investigations.\nOur study has some limitations. First, the geographic sources of infection relied on persons selfreporting symptom onset and travel histories, which are subject to inaccuracies. Second, we used air travel data from likely destinations in Colombia, but other locations also might have fueled COVID-19 emergence and dissemination in the country; flight travel data was not available for dates after March 9, 2020. Third, the number of sequences sampled represented a tiny fraction of the documented number of imported cases into Colombia. The sample was selected as a countrywide representation, given limited resources for genome sequencing; thus, the introduced viral diversity also might have been underestimated. Another limitation is the inherent uncertainty stemming from global unsystematic sampling. Therefore, the inferences about the number of introductions and the corresponding geographic sources should be interpreted with caution. We attempted to overcome this by undertaking sensitivity analyses and contrasting the results with the available epidemiologic data and our estimates from travel data. However, more sequence data from Colombia and undersampled countries, together with information of sampling representativeness per country, are needed to account for sampling uncertainty in a more statistically rigorous manner."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We describe the complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from 43 clinical samples, results of an epidemiologic investigation of imported cases, and the phylogenetic findings of 122 genome sequences from Colombia that characterize the epidemic onset of CO-VID-19 in the country.

Most of the notified introductions to countries in Latin America occurred from Europe, an observation that was supported by phylogenetic and air travel data (48; C.
