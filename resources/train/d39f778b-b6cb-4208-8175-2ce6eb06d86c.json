[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "\nIt is essential that the coastal land-cover information stored in the C-CAP database be taxonomically correct and consistent with coastal wetland information derived from other agencies. The C-CAP Coastal Land-Cover Classification System (Table 2) includes three Level I superclasses (Klemas et aI., 1993): 1.0-Upland, 2.0-Wetland, and 3.0-Water and Submerged Land. These superclasses are subdivided into classes and subclasses at Levels II and III, respectively. While the categories Wetland and Water and Submerged Land constitute the primary habitats of interest to NOAA, Uplands are also included because they influence adjacent wetlands and water bodies. The classification system is hierarchical, reflects ecological relationships, and focuses on land-cover classes that can be discriminated primarily from satellite remote sensor data. It was adapted and designed to be compatible with other nationally standardized classification systems, especially \u2022 the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) \"Land Use and Land Cover Classification System For Use with Remote Sensor Data\" (Anderson et a!., 1976;USGS, 1992; Appendix Table 1), \u2022 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) \"Classification of Wetlands and Deepwater Habitats of the United States\" (Cowardin et a!., 1979;Wilen, 1990; Appendix Table 2), and \u2022 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) classification system. Dedicated workshops on the C-CAP classification system and productive discussions and reviews with represen tatives from each of these major agencies resul ted in a classification system that is in harmony with other major U.S. land-cover databases. The C-CAP Coastal Land-Cover Classification System includes upland, wetland, submerged land, and water in a single, comprehensive scheme. An attempt has been made to identifY land-cover classes that can be derived primarily through remote sensing and that are important indicators of ecosystem change. Modifications were necessary to reconcile inconsistencies between Anderson et a!. (1976) and Cowardin et a!. (1979) and to remove all land-use categories (Dobson, 1993a). C-CAP focuses on land cover and its relationship to other functional components oflandscape (Dobson, 1993b). Definitions of the pertinent terms are as follows: \u2022 land cover-vegetation, soils, rocks, water (in its various forms), and constructed materials covering the land surface, physically present and visible. \u2022 land use-economic and cultural activities, permitted or not, that are practiced at a place which mayor may not be manifested as visible land-cover features. For example, forestry land use may be visibly manifested as forest land cover, but recreational land use may occur in many different types of land cover, often without visible evidence of recreational use. \u2022 landscape-the zone of in teraction and convergence of the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, and the solid earth. Its vertical bounds are determined by the frequency and exten t of in teractions pertinen t to a given field of inquiry. Horizontally, landscape may be divided into areal units defined by physical or cultural features pertinent to a field of inquiry. While all categories of the C-CAP classification system can be represented as two-dimensional features at the mapping scale of 1:24,000, some features may be mapped as lines (e.g. a Marine/Estuarine Rocky Shore) or points (e.g. unique landmarks). Most linear and point features will be obtained from nonsatellite sources of information (e.g. aerial photography or in situ measurement using GPS). Those classes and subclasses that are required by C-CAP and which each regional C-CAP project will include in its database are underlined in Table 2. The underlined classes, with the exception of aquatic beds, can generally be detected by satellite remote sensors, particularly when supported by surface in situ measurement"}, {"section_title": "The Coastal Region Management Problem", "text": "The conterminous United States lost 53 percent of its wetlands to agricultural, residential, and commercial land use from the 1780's to 1980's (Dahl, 1990). Oil spills occurring throughout the world continue to devastate coastal wetlands Uensen et al., 1990;Narumalani et al., 1993). Sea level has risen approximately 130 m in the past 17,500 years. More abundant \"greenhouse\" gases in the atmosphere may be increasing the Earth's average temperature (Clarke and Primus, 1990) and may, yet again, accelerate the global sea level rise, eventually inundating much of today's coastal wetlands (Lee et al., 1992). Unfortunately, current projections for U.S. population growth in coastal regions suggest accelerating losses of wetlands and adjacent habitats, as waste loads and competition for limited space and resources increase (U.S. Congress, 1989). Coastal wetlands and submersed habitats are being destroyed by erosion, dredge and fill, impoundments, toxic pollutants, eutrophication, and (for submersed habitats) excessive turbidity and sedimentation. Many marine finfish and shellfish depend on these coastal habitats for their survival. Salt marsh grasses, mangroves, macroalgae, and submersed grasses and forbs are essential as nourishment and animal habitat. Continued loss of these wetlands may lead to the collapse of coastal ecosystems and associated fisheries. Documentation of the loss or gain of coastal wetlands is needed for their conservation and effective managment of marine fisheries (Haddad and Ekberg, 1987;Haddad and McGarry, 1989;Kiraly et al., 1990;Kean et al. l ). Submersed grasses and forbs include seagrasses that require high salinity and other species of submersed rooted vascular plants (SRV) that tolerate or require low salinity water. Submersed grasses and forbs may be crucial indicators of water quality and overall health of coastal ecosystems (Dennison et al., 1993). Submersed vegetation has the additional requirement of living at photic depths and therefore is particularly sensitive to water clarity (Kenworthy and Haunert, 1991). Change (increase or decrease in areal extent, movement, consolidation or fragmentation, or qualitative change) in I Kean, T. H., C. Campbell, B. Gardner, and W. K. Reilly. 1988. Protecting America's wetlands: an action agenda. Final Report of the National Wetlands Policy Forum. The Conservation Foundation, Washington, D.C. submersed habitat may be a sensitive integrator of overall water quality and potential for change in fisheries productivity. Submersed rooted vascular aquatic beds define habitat critical for the support of many recreational and sport fisheries (Ferguson et al., 1980;Zieman, 1982;Phillips, 1984;Thayer et al., 1984;Zieman and Zieman, 1989;KJemas et al., 1993). Changes in uplands, wetlands, and submersed habitats can be rapid and pervasive. Hence, effective management requires frequent monitoring of coastal regions (at least twice per decade). It has long been suspected that a crucial factor in the observed decline of fisheries in most coastal regions is the declining quantity and quality of habitat. Landcover change is a direct measure of quantitative habitat loss or gain. For many marine fisheries the habitats (i.e. land covers) of greatest importance are saltmarsh and seagrass. Other fisheries, such as those for salmon, depend on a variety of habitats that may include upland as well. Land-cover change is also a direct measure of increases or decreases in sources of pollution, sedimentation, and other factors that determine habitat quality. Increases in developed land, for example, are accompanied by land disturbance that increases erosion and sedimentation and by hydrologic alteration that increases runoff. Similarly, cultivated land is associated with fertilizer and pesticide use that ultimately affects the marine environment. Hence, land-cover change is linked to habitat quantity and quality."}, {"section_title": "The NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) Solution _", "text": "For these reasons, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Ocean Program initiated the Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) , a cooperative interagency, State, and Federal effort to detect coastal upland and wetland land cover and submersed vegetation and to monitor change in the coastal region of the United States (Cross and Thomas, 1992;Haddad, 1992). The project uses digital remote sensor data, in situ measurement in conjunction with global positioning systems (GPS), and geographic information system (GIS) technology to monitor changes in coastal wetland habitats and adjacent uplands. Landsat multispectral scanner (MSS) data, Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data, and SPOT high resolution visible (HRV) data have been used success-fully to detect major categories of wetlands (Haddad and Harris, 1985;Jensen et aI., 1993b;Lade et aI. 2 ). However, they have not been used previously to map or monitor wetlands for regional or national coverage. The use of satellite imagery for mapping wetlands provides a number of advantages over conventional aerial photographs including timeliness, synopticity, and reduced costs. While aerial photography may be appropriate for high resolution cartography, satellite imagery is better suited and less costly for rapid, repeated observations over broad regions (Haddad and Harris, 1985;Bartlett, 1987;Klemas and Hardisky, 1987;Ferguson et aI., 1993). Although the program will stress the use of satellite imagery, particularly for coastal wetlands and adjacent uplands, aerial photography or a combination of photography and satellite imagery (TM or SPOT) will be used for mapping SRV (Orth and Moore, 1983) and certain other habitats, as suggested by Patterson (1986) and Lade et al. (1988). A methodology to photographically observe, analyze, and display spatial change in habitat defined by the presence of SRV was a prerequisite to a nationwide change detection effort (Thomas and Ferguson, 1990). The C-CAP nationally standardized database will be used to monitor land-cover and habitat change in the coastal regions of the United States (Thomas and Ferguson, 1990;Thomas et al. 1991) and to improve understanding of coastal uplands, wetlands (e.g. salt marshes), and submersed habitats (e.g. seagrass) and their linkages with the distribution, abundance, and health of living marine resources. Coastal regions of the U.S. will be monitored every one to five years depending on the anticipated rate and magnitude of change in each region and the availability of suitable remote sensing and in situ measurements. This monitoring cycle will provide feedback to habitat managers on the success or failure of habitat management policies and programs. Frequent feedback to managers will enhance the continued integrity or recovery of coastal ecosystems and the attendant productivity and health of fish and other living marine resources at minimal cost. In addition, the geographical database will allow managers and scientists to evaluate and, ultimately, to predict cumulative direct and indirect effects of coastal development on wetland habitats and living marine resources. Initially, C-CAP products will document current land-cover distribution and change that have occurred in the recent past. The database, as it increases with each subsequent monitoring cycle, will be an invaluable baseline resource for research, evaluation of local, State, and Federal wetland management strategies, and construction of predictive models. C-CAP directly supports NOAA's responsibilities in estuarine and marine science, monitoring, and management as legislated in the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act; the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act; the Coastal Zone Management Act; the Clean Water Act; the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act; and the National Environmental Policy Act. Landcover change data are essential to the implementation of a\" 0 et Loss\" wetlands policy. A large community of managers, scientists, and users were involved in developing a C-CAP protocol at the national level. Guidance in this document was derived from a series of professional workshops and in teragency working group meetings which focused on Approximately 40 scientists and environmental managers attended each major regional workshop held in the Southeast, Northeast, Pacific Coast, and Great Lakes regions; about 200 individuals participated in all workshops and special meetings. The community of users and providers of coastal habitat information were given an opportunity for review and comment. A detailed list of workshops is provided in Appendix 4. Although GCAP is national in scope, it is based on procedures also applicable at local and regional levels. Much of the content of this document is based on C-CAP sponsored research conducted at the regional level. For example, Klemas et al. (1993) of the College of Marine Studies at the University of Delaware developed the \"GCAP Coastal Land Cover Classification System\" by investigating existing upland and wetland classification systems and then synthesizing a new system that is practical at the regional level. Dobson and Bright (1991 of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) developed a regional prototype to inventory uplands and wetlands in the Chesapeake Bay region. Jensen et al. (1993a) evaluated various change detection algorithms for inland and coastal wetland environments near Charleston, S. C. Ferguson et al. (1993) developed a regional prototype to inventory SRV in North Carolina based on protocols developed by the Beaufort Laboratory, Southeast Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). Khorram et al. (1992) investigated methods of seamlessly integrating multiple-region C-CAP databases. The C-CAP protocol continues to evolve and improve. For example, projects underway in 1993 include analysis of the effects of tidal stage on remote-sensing classification, change detection accuracy assessment, refined techniques for classification of forested wetlands, and advanced change detection techniques (Appendix 5). Research continues on functional health indicators (e.g. biomass, productivity), plant stress (e.g. mangrove freeze), new data-collection instruments, and regional ecological modeling. Thus, C-CAP will continue to have a strong research and development component to improve and refine its operational techniques."}, {"section_title": "National Scope and Regional Implementation of C-CAP", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "_", "text": "No single Federal or State organization will collect all the information residing in the C-CAP database. Instead, regional inventories will be completed by regional experts following C-CAP guidelines. Therefore, it is important to define the logic used to specify a C-CAP region. First, regional boundaries must coincide with the following NOAA/NMFS regions: Northeast -Virginia through Maine, including the Great Lakes Southeast -Texas through North Carolina, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico Northwest -Oregon, Washington, and Alaska Southwest -California, Hawaii, Midway Islands, Wake, Guam, Mariana Islands, American Samoa, Johnston Atoll, Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, Baker and Howland Islands, and Jarvis Island. Coastal regions may be further subdivided, as appropriate, on the basis of State and other administrative boundaries or ecoregions as defined, for example, by Omernik (1987). The boundary should encompass coastal watersheds plus offshore coral reefs, algae, and seagrass beds in the photic zone. In keeping with the goals of C-CAP and anticipated funding constraints, the recommended ap-proach is to designate 1) standard coverage limits for general application and 2) extended coverage limits for regions with special needs. Standard coverage will utilize biological and other geographical boundaries appropriate to the needs of specified C-CAP users identified through the protocol workshops. Extended coverage will be defined for each regional project in collaboration with states and other regional organizations. NOAA will make every effort to identify and accommodate research, conservation, management, and the needs of other interests that rely on wetland maps and data. Regional projects will be designed to identify special needs that may require extended coverage and to suggest sources of funds to support the additional cost of extended coverage. The estuarine drainage area (EDA), defined by NOAA's National Ocean Service (NOS) as the \"land and water component of an entire watershed that most directly affects an estuary,\" is an appropriate standard coverage area for C-CAP. For the purposes of this program, all U.S. coasts are or will be defined as part of an EDA. The boundary of each EDA basin is defined to be consistent with U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) hydrologic units and codes. The estuarine drainage boundary as defined by NOS is considered a standard inland boundary for C-CAP regional projects. Regional analysts may employ C-CAP protocols upstream, but C-CAP funding is not intended for coverage beyond the EDA. However, C-CAP funding may be used to purchase satellite scenes that extend beyond the EDA if they are necessary to cover the coastal region. Functional definitions, such as \"limits of tidal influence,\" may be employed in response to local situations justified by local user communities and local or regional experts on a coastal region-byregion or estuary-by-estuary basis. Regional analysts should be aware of local, State, and Federal rights and responsibilities and should seek intergovernmental and interagency cooperation. Because C-CAP interests include the effects of eutrophication due to development of uplands, information from outside the EDA may be justified in high order streams that extend beyond the coastal region. In this case, the point where the river enters the region will be defined as a point source for inputs. The offshore boundary of each region is defined as the seaward extent of wetlands, seagrass, coral, or other submersed habitat detectable using remote sensing systems. The functional definition of limits of detection normally will be based on satellite and aerial sensors and will vary within and among regions. Both the limits of detection and the actual bathymetric range of SRV are based on light attenuation and, thus, will not be a consistent bathymetric contour even within a single region. Overlap ofregions, consistent with TM scene boundary overlap, is preferred so that analysts may calibrate results from neighboring regions. A healthy exchange between neighboring regional analysts could reconcile differences, not only in the area of overlap, but also in signature identification across both regions. Each regional project team will be responsible for calibrating the relationship between remotely sensed spectral information and other information such as field measurements of biomass and photosynthetic rates. Historically, such measurements have focused on relatively few of the many species, habitats, and land-cover types of significance in the coastal region. Analysts should also ensure that protocols originally developed for northern temperate latitudes are modified sufficiently to serve well in tropical areas of the southern United States, Caribbean, and Pacific Ocean, and in the Arctic areas of Alaska. It will be necessary, for example, to use different methods and sensors for coral reefs than for wetlands. Similarly, the identification of Arctic muskeg may require different methods and sensors from those used to identify temperate, herbaceous wetland."}, {"section_title": "Change Detection Every One to Five Years _", "text": "The frequency of change detection is a crucial issue. For most regions in the United States, the base year (referred to as T b or Date 1 in the diagrams) should be the most recent year for which acceptable satellite imagery for uplands and wetlands or aerial photographs for submersed habitat can be obtained, and for which sufficient in situ information is available to conduct an error evaluation. Exceptions may occur in regions where cloud cover is a perennial problem or where other considerations favor aerial photographs over satellite imagery. The choice of the second date of imagery (Date b-1 or b+1) may be more flexible. It may be desirable to choose a date one to five years earlier than the base period to capture recent changes in coastal habitats. Plans should then be made for another change analysis no later than five years after the base time. However, plans may be altered abruptly when natural or human-induced events, such as hurricanes and oil spills, occur. Five years is the recommended frequency of change detection for most regions, but shorter periods may be necessary in regions undergoing rapid economic development or affected by catastrophic events. Longer periods may be necessary where funds are limited or where change is exceptionally slow. Regional analysts are advised to evaluate rates of change and explicitly recommend the base year and change period as a part of each regional project proposal. Unfortunately, remotely sensed data obtained specifically for other purposes (e.g. urban analysis, forest inventory) often are not suitable for use in C-CAP. Aquatic beds, and even coastal wetlands, may not be identifiable on aerial photographs obtained for other purposes."}, {"section_title": "The Need for Standardization and", "text": "Guidelines _ C-CAP desires to create a synoptic, digital database of coastal wetland and upland land cover by class for a base time period and to identify change between the base period and other time periods. The use of satellite remote sensing to inventory uplands and wetlands, conventional aerial photography to inventory submerged lands, and GIS to analyze the data are important elements of the C-CAP methodology. However, the goal of completing an accurate change detection product overrides any given technical consideration. Therefore, timely high-quality information from aerial photographs, topographic maps, field experience, or other sources may be used to prepare C-CAP products if appropriate guidelines are followed. By standardizing procedures at the national level, this document will benefit not only C-CAP but also coastal management research conducted by other State and Federal agencies. C-CAP desires to facilitate the exchange of standardized data among programs, decrease duplication, and improve the quality and utility of decision support for wetlands policy, management, and research activities. All data accepted for inclusion and eventual distribution in the C-CAP database must adhere to the protocol described in this manual. The protocol is designed to allow flexibility in the use of elemen ts of the classification scheme and in the choice of remote sensor data, classification and change detection procedures, and other key elements that vary regionally. However, potential users must adhere to the protocol in order to maintain high quality information in the C-CAP database. Coastal land-cover change databases derived independently from C-CAP will be considered for dissemination as C-CAP products if originating organizations can document compliance with C-CAP protocol and data quality standards."}, {"section_title": "General Steps Required to Conduct Regional C-CAP Projects _", "text": "The general steps required to conduct regional C-CAP change detection projects using sateIlite remotely sensed data are summarized in Table 1.

This must be performed in conjunction with an appropriate classification scheme. Unfortunately, no existing standardized classification scheme was suitable for all C-CAP requirements. Therefore, great effort went into the development of the C-CAP Coastal Land-Cover Classification System, which can be used to inventory uplands and wetlands by using satellite remote sensor data and to inventory SRV by using metric aerial photography.

[1976] Urban or Built-Up class) characterizes constructed surfaces composed of concrete, asphalt, roofing, and other building materials with or without vegetation. This class has been divided into two subclasses based on the amount of constructed surface relative to the amount of vegetated surface present. High-Intensity Developed Land contains little or no vegetation. This subclass includes heavily built-up urban centers as well as large constructed surfaces in suburban and rural areas. Large buildings (such as multiple-family housing, hangars, and large barns), interstate highways, and runways typically fall into this subclass. Low-Intensity Developed Land contains substantial amounts of constructed surface mixed with substantial amounts ofvegetated surface. Small buildings (such as single family housing, farm outbuildings, and sheds), streets, roads, and cemeteries with associated grasses and trees typically fall into this subclass. Cultivated Land (\"Agricultural Land\" of Anderson et al. [1976]) includes herbaceous (cropland) and woody (orchards, nurseries, vineyards, etc.) cultivated lands. Seasonal spectral signatures, geometric field patterns, and road network patterns may help identify this land-cover type. Always associated with agricultural land use, cultivated land is used for the production of food and fiber. Grassland differs from \"Rangeland\" of Anderson et al. (1976) by excluding shrub-brushlands. Unmanaged Grasslands are dominated by naturally occurring grasses and forbs which are not fertilized, cut, tilled, or planted regularly. Managed Grasslands are maintained by human activity such as fertilization and irrigation, are distinguished by enhanced biomass productivity, and can be recognized through vegetative indices based on spectral characteristics. Examples of such areas include lawns, golf courses, forest or shrub areas converted to grassland, or areas of permanent grassland with altered species composition. This category includes managed pastures and pastures with vegetation that grows vigorously as fallow. Managed Grasslands are used for graz- ing or for growing and harvesting hay and straw for animal feed. Woody Land includes nonagricultural trees and shrubs. The category alleviates the problem of separating various sizes of trees and shrubs using satellite remote sensor data but allows a height-based separation if high resolution aerial photographs are available. The class may be partitioned into three subclasses: Deciduous, Evergreen, and Mixed. These three subclasses generally can be discriminated with satellite remote-sensing systems. Bare Land (derived from Barren Land of Anderson et al. [1976]) is composed of bare soil, rock, sand, silt, gravel, or other earthen material with little or no vegetation. Anderson et al.'s Barren Land was defined as having limited ability to support life; C-CAP's Bare Land is defined by the absence of vegetation without regard to inherent ability to support life. Vegetation, if present, is more widely spaced and scrubby than that in the vegetated classes. Unusual conditions such as a heavy rainfall may occasionally result in growth of a shortlived, luxuriant plant cover. Wet, nonvegetated, exposed lands are included in the Wetland categories. Bare Land may be bare temporarily because of human activities. The transition from Woody Land, Grassland, or Cultivated Land to Developed Land, for example, usually involves a Bare Land phase. Developed Land also may have temporary waste and tailing piles. Woody Land may be clearcut, producing a temporary Bare Land phase. When it may be inferred from the data that the lack of vegetation is due to an annual cycle of cultivation (e.g. plowing), the land is not included in the Bare Land class. Land temporarily without vegetative cover because of cropping or tillage is classified as Cultivated Land, not Bare Land."}, {"section_title": "Wetlands", "text": "Wetlands are lands where saturation with water is the dominant factor determining soil development and the types of plant and animal communities living in the soil and on its surface (Cowardin et aI., 1979). A characteristic feature shared by all wetlands is soil or substrate that is at least periodically saturated with or covered by water. The upland limit of wetlands is designated as 1) the boundary between land with predominantly hydrophytic cover and land with predominantly mesophytic or xerophytic cover; 2) the boundary between soil that is predominantly hydric and soil that is predominantly non hydric; or 3) in the case of wetlands without vegetation or soil, the boundary between land that is flooded or saturated at some time during the growing season each year and land that is not (Cowardin et aI., 1979). Most wetlands are vegetated and found on soil. Wetland in the C-CAP Coastal Land-Cover Classification System (Table 2) includes all areas considered wetland by Cowardin et al. (1979) except for bottoms, reefs, aquatic beds, and nonpersistent emergent wetlands. The class subdivision was adopted primarily from the Cowardin et al. system, shown in Appendix Table 2. At Level II, C-CAP incorporates certain Cowardin et al. classes (e.g. Rocky Shore, Unconsolidated Shore, Emergent Wetland) or grouped Cowardin et al. classes (e.g. Woody Wetland may be further divided into Scrub-Shrub and Forested categories) in combination with Cowardin et al. systems (i.e. Marine, Estuarine, Riverine, Lacustrine, Palustrine). Thus, a typical Level II class in the C-CAP system might be Palustrine Woody Wetland. Marine and Estuarine Rocky Shores (Cowardin et aI., 1979) were combined into a single class, Marine/Estuarine Rocky Shore. The same logic was used to produce Marine/Estuarine Unconsolidated Shore. Salinity exhibits a horizontal gradient in coastal estuarine marshes. This is evident not only through the direct measurement of salinity but in the horizontal distribution of marsh plants (Daiber, 1986). Therefore, the Estuarine Emergent Wetland class is partitioned into Haline (Salt) and Mixohaline (Brackish) Marshes. For both subclasses, the C-CAP classification system uses the Cowardin et al. (1979) definitions. Mixohaline salinity ranges from O.S ppt to 30 ppt, and Haline salinity is c30 ppt. Within a marsh. plant zonation is usually quite evident. Along the Atlantic coast of orth America the pioneer plant on regularly flooded mudflats is saltmarsh cordgrass, Spartina alterniJlora, which often appears in pure stands. In more elevated areas that are flooded less frequently, saltmeadow hay, Spartina patens, often dominates. The upland interfaces are bordered by marsh elder, Iva frutescens, and groundsel tree, Baccharis halimifolia. Thus, salt marshes may be subdivided further into High Marsh and Low Marsh, but this distinction is not required in C-CAP regional projects. The C-CAP Coastal Land-Cover Classification System does not attempt to identify freshwater nonpersistent emergent wetlands because they are invisible during much of the year and are difficult to detect by remote sensors. These wetlands are classified as Riverine Water and Lacustrine Water."}, {"section_title": "Water and Submerged Land", "text": "All areas of open water with <30% cover of trees, shrubs, persistent emergent plants, emergent mosses, or lichens are assigned to the superclass Water and Submerged Land, whether the area is considered wetland or deepwater habitat under the Cowardin et al.

The Water class includes Cowardin et al.'s (1979) classes Rock Bottom and Unconsolidated Bottom, and Nonpersistent Emergent Wetlands, as well as Reefs and Aquatic Beds that are not identified as such. Most C-CAP products will display water as a single class. However, the major systems (Marine/Estuarine, Riverine, Lacustrine, Palustrine) are ecologically different from one another, and for this reason, the C-CAP system iden tifies the four systems as Level III subclasses: 3.11-Marine/Estuarine Water, 3.12-Riverine Water, 3.13-Lacustrine Water, and 3.14-Palustrine Water. While C-CAP does not require these subclasses, the option is provided to participants who may have such data available from ancillary sources. Having the water subclasses also makes the C-CAP scheme more compatible with the Cowardin et al. (1979) system. The subclass 3.11-Marine/Estuarine Water includes Bottoms and undetected Reefs and Aquatic Beds. The subclasses 3.12-Riverine Water, 3.13-Lacustrine Water, and 3.14-Palustrine Water include Bottoms and undetected Aquatic Beds as well as Nonpersistent Emergent Wetlands. Palustrine waterbodies, defined as covering <20 acres, are smaller than Lacustrine waterbodies. C-CAP combined Marine and Estuarine Reefs and Aquatic Beds into two classes: Marine/Estuarine Reefs and Marine/Estuarine Aquatic Beds. Marine/Estuarine Aquatic Beds includes the subclass Rooted Vascular, which is subdivided into High Salinity (cS ppt) and Low Salinity \u00abS ppt). The cS ppt salinity level separates seagrasses from submersed grass and forbs that tolerate or require low salinity. Both types of plants define aquatic beds, submersed habitats that are important to the C-CAP project. High Salinity includes mesohaline, polyhaline, euhaline, and hyperhaline salinity categories of Cowardin et al. (1979). Low Salinity includes oligohaline and fresh categories \u00abS ppt salinity). With the noted exceptions, most of the Wetland and Water classes have definitions similar to those contained in Cowardin et al. (1979) so that data can be interchanged with other programs, such as the USFWS National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) program, which is based on the Cowardin et al. (1979) classification system.

This eliminates diurnal sun angle effects which can cause anomalous differences in the reflectance properties of remotely sensed objects. Second, whenever possible it is desirable to use remotely sensed data acquired on anniversary dates (e.g. 1 October 1988versus 1 October 1993. Using anniversary date imagery removes seasonal sun angle differences that can make change detection difficult and unreliable Qensen et aI., 1993a).

Geometric rectification algorithms Qensen, 1986;Novak, 1992) are used to register the images to a standard map projection (Universal Transverse Mercator [UTM] for most U.S. projects). Rectification should result in the two images having a root mean square error (RMSE) of :\":: \u00b10.5 pixel. RMSE~\u00b10.5 pixel may result in the identification of spurious areas of change between the two datasets. See \"Rectification of Multiple-date Remote Sensor Data\" for a summary of C-CAP image rectification requirements. It is possible to perform change detection using data collected by two different sensor systems with different IFOV's, e.g. Landsat TM data (30 x 30 m) for date 1 and SPOT HRV data (20 x 20 m) for date 2. In such cases, it is necessary to decide upon a representative minimum mapping unit (e.g. 20 x 20 m) and then resample both datasets to this uniform pixel size. This does not present a significant problem as long as one remembers that the information content of the resampled data can never be greater than the IFOV of the original sensor system (i.e. even though the Landsat TM data are resampled to 20 x 20 m pixels, the information was still acquired at 30 x 30 m resolution, and one should not expect to be able to extract additional spatial detail in the dataset) . Some remote-sensing systems like SPOT collect data at off-nadir look angles as much as \u00b120\u2022 (Table 3), i.e. the sensors obtain data of an area on the ground from an \"oblique\" vantage point. Two images with significantly different look angles can cause problems when used for change detection purposes. For example, consider a maple forest consisting of very large, randomly spaced trees. A SPOT image acquired at O\u2022 off-nadir will look directly down upon the \"top\" of the canopy. Conversely, a SPOT image acquired at 20\u2022 off-nadir will record reflectance information from the \"side\" of the canopy. Differences in reflectance from the two datasets can cause spurious change detection results. Therefore, the data used in a remote-sensing digital change detection should be acquired with approximately the same look angle whenever possible."}, {"section_title": "Spectral Resolution", "text": "A fundamental assumption of digital change detection is that there should exist a difference in the spectral response of a pixel on two dates if the biophysical materials within the IFOV have changed between dates. Ideally, the spectral resolution of the remote sensor  system is sufficient to record reflected radiant flux in spectral regions that best capture the most descriptive spectral attributes of the object. Unfortunately, different sensor systems do not record energy in exactly the same portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, i.e. bandwidths (Table 3). For example, Landsat MSS records energy in four relatively broad bands, SPOT HRV sensors record in three relatively coarse multispectral bands and one panchromatic band, and TM records in six relatively narrow optical bands and one broad thermal band (Table 3). Ideally, the same sensor system is used to acquire imagery on multiple dates. When this is not possible, the analyst should select bands which approximate one another. For example, SPOT bands 1 (green), 2 (red), and 3 (near-infrared) can be used successfully with TM bands 2 (green), 3 (red), and 4 (near-infrared) or MSS bands 1 (green), 2 (red), and 4 (near-infrared). Many of the change detection algorithms to be discussed do not function well when bands from one sensor system do not match those of another sensor system. For example, using TM band 1 (blue) with either SPOT or MSS data is not wise."}, {"section_title": "Radiometric Resolution", "text": "Converting satellite remote sensor data from analog to digital usually results in 8-bit brightness values with values ranging from 0 to 255 (Table 3).

However, the precision of decompressed brightness values can never be better than the original, uncompressed data."}, {"section_title": "The Preferred C-CAP Satellite Sensor System", "text": "TM is currently the primary sensor recommended for C-CAP image acquisition and change analysis for all land cover except aquatic beds. Although its spatial resolution is not as good as that of a SPOT satellite or aircraft MSS image, a TM image is generally less expensive to acquire and process for large-area coverage. Compared with SPOT imagery, TM has better spectral resolution and specific spectral bands that are more applicable to wetlands delineation (bands 5 and 7). In addition, TM is preferred over SPOT because TM has collected data for a longer time (since 1982, as opposed to SPOT since 1986) and because many TM scenes of U.S. coastal regions were systematically collected on a routine basis. There are advantages and disadvantages to using other sensors. Aircraft multispectral scanners are more expensive and complex to use over large regions (Jensen et aI., 1987). However, good algorithms are now available for georeferencing, and in certain cases (e.g. when higher spectral or spatial resolution is needed and when unfavorable climatic conditions for satellite sensors exist) aircraft sensors may be optimum. The SPOT sensor has a greater temporal coverage because the satellite can collect data off-nadir. However, if off-nadir SPOT imagery is used for C-CAP change analyses, the data must be normalized to compensate for different look angles that may preclude pixel-to-pixel spectral-change analysis. Nevertheless, SPOT imagery may be a reasonable alternative in certain areas because of cloud cover or other impediments to TM data availability. C-CAP remains flexible to take advantage of new sensors and other technologies that become operational during the lifetime of the program. Regional participants should work with the C-CAP program coordinators to ensure that the sensor selection meets the following C-CAP requirements: \u2022 Standard radiometrically corrected TM data are required, and geocoded (georeferenced) data are optional. If geocoded data are selected, the coordinate system should be UTM. \u2022 Regional participants must collaborate with C-CAP managers to ensure that the exchange medium and its format will be amenable to the processing capabilities of the participants. \u2022 C-CAP normally will purchase and archive the raw data in collaboration with the regional image processing center. In cases where the regional participants already have usable raw imagery or are making their own purchases, formal agreements between C-CAP managers and participants must address vendor licensing and other legal requirements as well as C-CAP archiving and quality-control protocol."}, {"section_title": "Important Environmental Characteristics __", "text": "Failure to understand the impact of various environmental characteristics on the remote-sensing change detection process can also lead to inaccurate C-CAP results. When performing change detection it is desirable to hold environmental variables as constant as possible. Specific environmental variables and their potential impacts are described below."}, {"section_title": "Atmospheric Conditions", "text": "There should be no clouds, haze, or extreme humidity on the days remote-sensing data are collected. Even a thin layer of haze can alter spectral signatures in satellite images enough to create the false impression of spectral change between two dates. Obviously, 0% cloud cover is preferred for satellite imagery and aerial photography. At the upper limit, cloud cover >20% is usually unacceptable. In addition, clouds not only obscure terrain but the cloud shadow also causes major image classification problems. Any area obscured by clouds or affected by cloud shadow will filter through the entire change detection process, severely limiting the utility of the final change detection product. Therefore, regional analysts must use good professional judgment to evaluate such factors as the criticality of the specific locations affected by cloud cover and shadow and the availability of timely surrogate data for those areas obscured (e.g. perhaps substituting aerial photography interpretation for a critical area). Even when the stated cloud cover is 0%, it is advisable to \"browse\" the proposed image on microfiche at the National Cartographic Information Center in each State to confirm that the cloud cover estimate is correct. Assuming no cloud cover, the use of anniversary dates helps to ensure general, seasonal agreement between the atmospheric conditions on the two dates. However, if dramatic differences exist in the atmospheric conditions presen t on the n dates of imagery to be used in the change detection process, it may be necessary to remove the atmospheric attenuation in the imagery. Two alternatives are available. First, sophisticated atmospheric transmission models can be used to correct the remote-sensor data if substantial in situ data are available on the day of the overflights. Second, an alternative empirical method may be used to remove atmospheric effects. A detailed description of one empirical method of image-to-image normalization is found in \"Radiometric Normalization of Multiple-Date Images."}, {"section_title": "Soil Moisture Conditions", "text": "Ideally, the soil moisture conditions should be identical for the n dates of imagery used in a change detection project. Extremely wet or dry conditions on one date can cause serious change detection problems. Therefore, when selecting the remotely sensed data to be used for change detection it is very important not only to look for anniversary dates but also to review precipitation records to determine how much rain or snow fell in the days and weeks prior to data collection. When soil moisture differences between dates are significant for only certain parts of the study area (perhaps due to a local thunderstorm), it may be necessary to stratify (eliminate) those affected areas and perform a separate analysis that can be added back in the final stages of the project."}, {"section_title": "Vegetation Phenological Cycle Characteristics", "text": "Vegetation grows according to seasonal and annual phenological cycles. Obtaining near-anniversary images greatly minimizes the effects of wetland seasonal phenological differences that may cause spurious change to be detected in the imagery. One must also be careful about two other factors when dealing with upland seasonal agricultural crops. First, many monoculture crops (e.g. corn) normally are planted at approximately the same time of year. A month lag in planting date between fields having the same crop can cause serious change detection error. Second, many monoculture crops are composed of different species (or strains) of the same crop, which can cause the crop to reflect energy differently on multiple dates of anniversary imagery. These observations suggest that the analyst must know the biophysical characteristics of the vegetation as well as the cultural land-tenure practices in the study area so that imagery which meets most of these characteristics can be selected for change detection. The choice of image date is best determined by mutual agreement among remote-sensing specialists, biologists, ecologists, and local experts. The selection of the acceptable window of acquisition will be made independently by participants in each region. No single season will serve for all areas because of substantial latitudinal variation extending from temperate to tropical regions. For example, coastal marshes in the mid-Atlantic region are best inventoried from June through October while submersed habitats in southern Florida may be best inventoried in November. Even within regions, some cover types will be more easily distinguished in different seasons. For example, in the Caribbean, estuarine seagrasses can be best detected in early January, yet marine seagrasses can be best detected in Mayor June. Technically, these vegetation patterns should be monitored at optimal times throughout the year, but cost limitations usually limit the analyst to a single date."}, {"section_title": "Effects of Tidal Stage on Image Classification", "text": "Tidal stage is a crucial factor in satellite image scene selection and the timing of aerial surveys. Ideally, tides should be constant between time periods, but this would rule out synoptic satellite sensors since tidal stages are not synchronized within a region or even within a single image. Alternatively, analysts should avoid selecting the highest tides and should take into account the tide stages occurring throughout each scene. Tidal effect varies greatly among regions. In the Northwest, for example, when all of the temporal, atmospheric, and tidal criteria are taken into account, the number of acceptable scenes may be quite small. In some regions it may be necessary to seek alternative data such as SPOT satellite data, aerial photographs, or other landcover databases. For most regions, mean low tide (MLT) or lower will be preferred, one or two feet above MLT will be acceptable, and three feet or more will be unacceptable (Jensen et aI., 1993a). Ideally, tides for aerial photographic surveys of submersed habitat should approach low tide as predicted in NOS tide tables, but optimal visualization of the subtidal bottom depends on water clarity as well as depth. Two of the 1993 C-CAP protocol development projects focus on improving the C-CAP protocol for tidal effects (see AppendiX 5). Image Processing Data to Inventory Upland and Wetland Change _ With the classification scheme developed and the appropriate remote-sensor data selected, it is possible to process the data to extract upland and wetland change information. This involves geometric and radiometric correction, selection of an appropriate change detection algorithm, classification if necessary, creation of change detection products, and error evaluation (Table  1). A separate section (Chapter 4) describes the extraction of information on SRV because aerial photography and significantly different photogrammetric techniques must be utilized."}, {"section_title": "Rectification of Multiple-Date Remote Sensor Data", "text": "Georeferencing (spatial registration ofa remotely sensed image to a standard map projection) is a necessary step in digital change detection and cartographic representation. The following C-CAP recommendations should be followed when rectifying the base image to a standard basemap: \u2022 Geocoded base TM images can be purchased if preferred by regional analysts. However, participants should be aware that some analysts have reported undocumented variations in commercial products that can lead to poor registration in certain regions, especially where local relief requires substantial terrain correction. Additional registration may be necessary to achieve the C-CAP standard precision of RMSE \u00b1O.5 pixel. Therefore, it is recommended that each regional project perform its own base image-to-map rectification by using data that is radiometrically corrected but not geocoded. Rectification of an earlier date (TIrl) or later date (Tbtl) to the base image (T b ) can be accomplished in several ways. The primary concern is to accomplish the most exact co-registration of pixels from each time period and thus reduce a potentially significant source of error in change analysis (Lunetta et aI., 1991). The following are minimum recommendations and requirements: \u2022 Geocoded and terrain-corrected TM data can be ordered from commercial vendors. Two separate images can be overlaid according to like coordinates, but this technique may introduce error if prior geocoding was not precisely the same in both images. The regional analyst has no control in this process, but if high precision is accomplished by the vendor, the analyst can significantly reduce image processing effort at the regional facility. \u2022 The regional analyst can geocode the image to UTM coordinates as was done with the base image. If this technique is adopted, it is important to use the identical GCP's and resampling algorithm that were used to rectify the base image. \u2022 For multiple images, the preferred technique is to rectify nongeocoded images directly to the geocoded base image. This technique may have the advantage of reducing or better controlling co-registration error among images. Selection and consistency of control points and rectification algorithms are important to the success of this technique. Cubic convolution algorithms normally yield the most precise spatial fit, but cubic convolution and bilinear interpolation algorithms suffer from the disadvantage of averaging pixel brightness values. Nearest-neighbor algorithms are spatially less precise, but they offer the advantage of retaining pixel brightness values through the processes of rectification and registration."}, {"section_title": "Radiometric N onnalization of Multiple-Date Images", "text": "The use of remotely sensed data to classify coastal and upland land cover on individual dates is contingent upon there being a robust relationship between remotely sensing brightness values (BV's) and actual surface conditions. However, factors such as sun angle, Earth/Sun distance, detector calibration differences between the various sensor systems, atmospheric condition, and sun/target/sensor geometry (phase angle) will also affect pixel brightness value. Differences in direct beam solar radiation due to variation in sun angle and Earth/sun distance can be calculated accurately, as can variation in pixel BV's due to detector calibration differences between sensor systems. Removing atmospheric and phase-angle effects requires information about the gaseous and aerosol composition of the atmosphere and the bidirectional reflectance characteristics of elements within the scene. However, atmospheric and bidirectional reflectance information are rarely available for historical remotely sensed data. Also, some analysts may not have the necessary expertise to perform a theoretically based atmospheric path radiance correction on remotely sensed data. Hence, it is suggested that a relatively straightforward \"empirical scene normalization\" be employed to match the detector calibration, astronomic, atmospheric, and phaseangle conditions present in a reference scene. Image normalization reduces pixel BV variation caused by nonsurface factors, so variations in pixel BV's between dates can be related to actual changes in surface conditions. Normalization enables the use of image analysis logic developed for a base-year scene to be applied to other scenes. This can be accomplished using techniques pioneered by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (Eckhardt et aI., 1990). Image normalization is achieved by developing simple regression equations between the brightness values of \"normalization targets\" present in T b and the scene to be normalized (e.g. TIrl or Tbtl)' Normalization targets are assumed to be constant reflectors, therefore any changes in their brightness values are attributed to detector calibration, astronomic, atmospheric, and phase-angle differences. Once these variations are removed, changes in BV may be related to changes in surface conditions. Acceptance criteria for potential \"normalization targets\" (Eckhardt et aI., 1990)  The mean BV's of the T b targets are regressed against the mean BV's of the TI>-l or Tb+\\ targets for the n bands used in the classification of the remote sensor data (e.g. TM bands 2, 3, and 4). The slope and y-intercept of the n equations are then used to normalize the Tb+l or TI>-l Landsat TM data to the T b Landsat TM data. Each regression model contains an additive component (y-intercept) that corrects for the difference in atmospheric path radiance between dates and contains a multiplicative term (slope) that corrects for the difference in detector calibration, sun angle, Earth/Sun distance, atmospheric attenuation, and phase angle between dates. It is customary first to normalize the remote-sensor data and then perform image rectification (using nearest-neighbor resampling ifimage classification is to take place). These data are then ready for individual date classification or the application of various multi-image change detection algorithms. Most studies that attempt to monitor biophysical properties such as vegetation biomass, chlorophyll absorption, and health require atmospheric correction. Selecting the Appropriate Change Detection Algorithm _ C-CAP is the first Federal program to state as a primary goal the monitoring of coastal habitat change using satellite technology (Cross and Thomas, 1992). The implementation and continuing evolution of the program is based on the fact that improved cartographic, digital image processing, and photointerpretation methods must be developed for a program of this geographic coverage, spatial resolution, and temporal frequency (nationwide, 30 x 30 m pixel, every one to five years). Initial implementation ofC-CAP will require a blend of traditional and innovative approaches to change analysis. Because the program has adopted a digital format, with TM as a primary sensor, new techniques in processing can be easily incorporated into future iterations. The selection of an appropriate change detection algorithm is very important (Jensen, 1986;Dobson and Bright, 1991Jensen et aI., 1993a). First, it will have a direct impact on the type of image classification to be performed (if any). Second, it will dictate whether important \"from-to\" information can be extracted from the imagery. C-CAP requires that from-to information be readily available in digital form suitable for geographic analysis and for producing maps and tabular summaries. At least seven change detection algorithms are commonly used by the remote-sensing community: It is instructive to review these alternatives, identify those acceptable to C-CAP, and provide specific examples where appropriate."}, {"section_title": "Change Detection Using Write Function Memory Insertion", "text": "It is possible to insert individual bands of remotely sensed data into specific write function memory banks (red, green, and/or blue) in the digital image process-  (Jensen, 1994).  1988;Eastman and Fulk, 1993). This results in the computation of eigenvalues and factor loadings that are used to produce a new, un correlated PCA image dataset. Usually, several of the new bands of information are directly related to change. The difficulty arises when trying to interpret and label each component image. Nevertheless, the method is valuable and is used frequently. The advantage of the techniques is that only a single classification is required.

This composite dataset can be analyzed in a number of ways to extract change information. First, a traditional classification using all n bands (six in the example in Fig. 3) may be performed. Unsupervised classification techniques will result in the creation of \"change\" and \"no-change\" clusters. The analyst must then label the clusters accordingly. Other researchers have used principle component analysis (PCA) to detect change (Jensen, 1986). Again, the method involves registering two (or more) dates of remotely sensed data to the same planimetric basemap as described earlier and then placing them in the same dataset. A PCA based on variance-covariance matrices or a standardized PCA based on an analysis of correlation matrices is then performed (Fung and LeDrew, It is possible to simply identify the amount of change between two images by band ratioing or image differencing the same band in two images that have previously been rectified to a common basemap. Image differencing involves subtracting the imagery of one date from that of another (Fig. 4). The subtraction results in positive and negative values in areas of radiance change and zero values in areas of no-change in a new \"change image.\" In an 8-bit (2 8 ) analysis with pixel values ranging from 0 to 255, the potential range of difference values is -255 to 255. The results are normally transformed into positive values by adding a constan t, C (usually 255). The operation is expressed mathematically as B~k(2) = brightness value at T1>--1 or T&+-1' c = a constant (e.g. 255), i = line number, j = column number, and k = a single band (e.g. TM band 4). The \"change image\" produced using image differencing usually yields a BV distribution approximately Gaussian in nature, where pixels of no BV change are distributed around the mean and pixels of change are found in the tails of the distribution. Band ratioing involves exactly the same logic except a ratio is computed between T b and Tb+-1 or Tb-1 and the pixels that did not change have a value of \"1\" in the change image. A critical element of both image-differencing and band-ratioing change detection is deciding where to place the threshold boundaries between \"change\" and   (Jensen, 1994). \"no-change\" pixels displayed in the histogram of the change image (Jensen, 1986). Often, a standard deviation from the mean is. selected and tested empirically. Conversely, most analysts prefer to experiment empirically, placing the threshold at various locations in the tails of the distribution until a realistic amount of change is encountered. Thus, the amount of change selected and eventually \"recoded\" for display is often subjective and must be based on familiarity with the study area. There are also analytical methods that can be used to select the most appropriate thresholds. Unfortunately, image differencing simply identifies those areas that may have changed and provides no information on the nature of the change, i.e. no from-to information.

Unfortunately, every error in the individual date classification map will also be present in the final change detection map (Rutchey and Velcheck, 1993). Therefore, it is imperative that the individual classification maps used in the postclassification change detection method be extremely accurate (Augenstein et aI., 1991;Price et aI., 1992).

The analyst usually selects a threshold value to identify spectral change and nochange pixels in the new image as discussed in \"Image Algebra Change Detection.\" The spectral change image is then recoded into a binary mask file, consisting ofpixels with spectral change between the two dates, and these are viewed as candidate pixels for categorical change.

This should not be difficult since the two systems are highly compatible. Next, T~l or T IJt1 of the analysis is classified and then compared on a pixel-by-pixel basis with T b information. Traditional from-to information can then be derived. As with any other postclassification comparison, the accuracy of the change database is dependent on the accuracy of both input databases (C-CAP and NWI). Advantages of the method include the use of a well-known, trusted data source (NWI) and the possible reduction of errors of omission and commission. Detailed from-to information may be obtained by using this method. Also, only a single classification of the T~l or  (Dobson and Bright, 1992)."}, {"section_title": "Manual On-Screen Digitization of Change", "text": "Considerable amounts of high resolution remote sensor data are now available (e.g. SPOT 10 x 10 m, the aircraft moun ted Calibrated Airborne Spectrographic Imager [CASI] of the National Aerial Photography Program [NAPP]). These data can be rectified and used as planimetric basemaps or orthophotomaps. Often aerial photographs are scanned (digitized) at high resolutions into digital image files (Light, 1993). These photographic datasets can then be registered to a common basemap and compared to identify change. Digitized high resolution aerial photographs displayed on a CRT screen can be interpreted easily using standard photo interpretation techniques based on size, shape, shadow, texture, etc. (Ryerson, 1989). Therefore, it is becoming increasingly common for analysts to interpret visually both dates of aerial photographs (or other type of remote-sensor data) on the screen, annotate the important features using heads-up on-screen digitizing, and compare the various images to detect change (Cowen et a!., 1991;Cheng et a!., 1992;Lacy, 1992; Wang et a!., 1992; Westmoreland and Stow, 1992). The process is especially easy when 1) both digitized photographs (or images) are displayed on the CRT side by side, and 2) they are topologically linked through object-oriented programming so that a polygon drawn around a feature on one photograph will also be drawn around the same feature on the other photograph. Scanning aerial photographs unavoidably reduces the spatial and spectral resolution of source data. This loss may be significant in photographs of submerged features, which are subject to interferences from aquatic as well as atmospheric sources. As with other new technologies, demonstration ofthe appropriateness of interpretation of scanned photographs will be a critical step in expanding the C-CAP Protocol (Also see \"Accuracy Assessment for Individual Date Classification of Water and Submersed Habitat Data\"). The manual on-screen approach is recommended as a useful adjunct to other change detection methods. Its principle drawback is the time required to cover large regions in such a labor-intensive fashion.  (Dobson and Bright, 1992)."}, {"section_title": "Selecting Appropriate Classification Algorithms", "text": "C-CAP requires that the classification procedures used as part of the change detection process be approved and documented. Classification algorithms used in each region will be selected based on the capabilities and needs of the regional participants. C-CAP assumes that the regional participants are experienced in image processing and mapping. If not, C-CAP will attempt to provide fundamental technical assistance on a case-by-ease basis. The previous section indicated that these three of the seven most commonly used change detection algorithms are acceptable for C-CAP regional projects: Each of these requires a complete pixel-by-pixel classification of one date of imagery and, at least, a partial Figure 14 Binary \"change/no-change mask\" produced by image differencing TM bands 3, 4, and 5 of each date (Dobson and Bright, 1992). classification of an additional date. Hence, it is instructive to review the C-CAP-approved image classification logic which may be used in the regional projects."}, {"section_title": "Supervised and Unsupervised Image Classification Logic", "text": "The primary reaSOn for employing digital image classification algorithms is to reduce human labor and improve consistency. It is expected that regional analysts will have sufficient expertise to assess the advantages of alternative classification algorithms and to recognize when human pattern recognition and other types of intervention are necessary. In practice, it may be necessary to employ a suite of algorithms including both supervised and unsupervised statistical pattern recognition approaches. Currently, maximum-likelihood classifiers often serve as a good first step, but new statistical approaches are being developed and implemented on a routine basis (Jensen et aI., 1987;Hodgson and Plews, 1989;Foody et aI., 1992). It is important for analysts to remain flexible with regard to procedures and algorithms. Standard supervised and unsupervised classification techniques have been available for more than 20 years and are well documented in texts by Jensen (1986) and Campbell (1987). In a supervised classification, the analyst \"trains\" the classifier by extracting mean and covariance statistics for known phenomena in a single date of remotely sensed data (Gong and Howarth, 1990). These statistical patterns are then passed to a minimum-distance-to-means algorithm in which unknown pixels are assigned to the nearest class in n-dimensional feature space, or passed to a maximum-likelihood classification algorithm that assigns an unknown pixel to the class in which it has the highest probability of being a member. Great care must be exercised when selecting training samples (Mausel et aI., 1990).

The analyst must then convert (label) the x spectral clusters into information classes such as those found in the C-CAP Coastal Land-Cover Classification System. Training sites visited in the field and identifiable in the digital imagery are also indispensable when labeling clusters in an unsupervised classification. The following sections discuss C-CAP guidelines for collecting training and verification samples."}, {"section_title": "Selection of Training and Verification Samples for Supervised and Unsupervised Classification", "text": "Only training sites that were actually visited on the ground by experienced professionals should be selected for extracting the multispectral statistical \"signature\" of a specific class when performing a supervised or unsupervised classification. It is suggested that a minimum of five training sites per land-cover class be collected. This creates a representative training set when performing supervised classification and makes labeling clusters much easier in an unsupervised classification. In addition to the image analysts, the field team should contain specialists in ecology, biology, forestry, geography, statistics, and other pertinent fields, such as agronomy. Field samples should be stratified by land-eover type and by various physical factors such as slope, elevation, vegetation density, species mix, season, and latitude. The polygonal boundary of all field sites should be measured using CPS whenever possible, and the locational, temporal, and categorical information should be archived. The collection of field training sites often requires multiple visits to the field. Some of the field sites may be used to train a classifier or label a cluster while a certain proportion of the field sample sites should be held back to be used for classification error assessment, which will be discussed. The following materials are indispensable to a successful field exercise: \u2022 Imagery geocorrected to a standard map projection \u2022 Topographic maps at 1:24,000 or the largest available scale \u2022 Global Positioning System (GPS) \u2022 Aerial photographs It is advisable to perform, at least, a cursory classification before initiating fieldwork. In this case, both raw and classified data should be taken to the field. The primary function of the cursory classification is to guide field workers in targeting the covers and signatures that are most difficult and confusing. Keep in mind that the vast majority of all cover will be easy to identifY on the ground and on the imagery. Efficient use of field time provides for quick verification of easy cover types and maximum attention to difficult, unusual, and ecologically critical cover types. Field investigators should anticipate the need to know not only the geodetic coordinates of training sites but also the layout of the road network that will provide access. It is advisable to imbed roadway information into the raw imagery. This can be done using the Bureau of the Census Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) files. Imbedding is preferred rather than transparent-overlay techniques, which are cumbersome and difficult to use under field conditions. C-CAP investigators have assembled and tested a field station based on a color laptop computer with commercial software. At present the software supports visualization of raster imagery (e.g. satellite data, digital orthophotographs, scanned aerial photographs) and vector databases (e.g. TIGER road networks, NWI wetlands). A version of the software soon to be available from commercial vendors will allow realtime input of GPS coordinates. It will then be possible to follow field movements directly on the image and map data. The software also allows for completion of field forms on screen in the field. Preliminary tests are encouraging, but the field station is not fully operational at this time. One shortcoming, for example, is the poor performance of active matrix color screens in sunlight."}, {"section_title": "Use of Collateral Data in Image Classification", "text": "The overriding goal is to produce accurate individual date classifications and accurate change detection databases. Any information or operation that enhances data quality is generally encouraged. C-CAP does not endorse the notion that the use of collateral data in a remote-sensing project is \"hedging.\" Instead, the objective is to use collateral data innovatively to improve the accuracy of the C-CAP database. There are many potential sources of collateral data including soil maps, OAA coastlines (T-sheets), timber surveys, USGS digital line graphs, and digital elevation models (for elevation, slope, and aspect). These can be incorporated by masking, filtering, probability weighting, or including in the signature file (Ryerson, 1989;Baker et aI., 1991). Depending on the importance of each category, analysts may use certain categories to overrule others (Jensen et aI., 1993a). The NWI is an especially valuable collateral database that may be of value when classifying wetlands. Regional analysts should incorporate NWI data to the maximum extent possible. NWI data are recognized as the most authoritative and complete source of wetlands land-cover data (Wilen, 1990). However, NWI maps are not temporally synchronized in each region and are not in a digital format for many regions. An approach based on complementary use of NWI and imagery will be an asset to both C-CAP and NWI. At a minimum, NWI maps, digital data, or both should be used to define training samples, to check intermediate results, and to aid in the final verification of the wetlands portion of the C-CAP maps. NWI digital data may be used as a probability filter in the classification process. In this approach, C-CAP recommends an \"innocent until proven guilty\" attitude toward the NWI data. In other words, the NWI category is considered correct for a given pixel area for each time period, unless spectral signatures or collateral data suggest that the NWI category is incorrect or a land-cover change has occurred. Even if the NWI data were 100% correct at the time of NWI mapping, overriding by spectral data would be necessary to detect change over time. Ultimately in turn, the C-CAP change detection database can assist NWI managers in determining the need for NWI updates."}, {"section_title": "Cartographic Portrayal of Classification and Change Detection Maps", "text": "C-CAP products must meet stringent cartographic standards. The following sections discuss the minimum measurement unit and its proper use when aggregating change information. Formats of classification maps and change maps must satisfy C-CAP criteria whenever hardcopy maps are produced."}, {"section_title": "The Concept of the Minimum Measurement Unit", "text": "The minimum measurement unit is a measure of both the precision and accuracy of input data. For most C-CAP regional projects, the input data will be 30 x 30 m pixel data recorded by a Landsat TM sensor. The minimum measurement unit, however, combines the ability (e.g. sensor limitations) and effort (e.g. field verification) required to measure a category with the spatial precision and accuracy necessary to accomplish the intended use of the data. Each land-cover category could potentially have a different minimum measurement unit based on the size of individual parcels and the distinctiveness of the signature. Thus, the minimum measurement unit differs from a traditional minimum mapping unit, which by definition imposes a predetermined polygon (or pixel) size for all land-cover categories (for example, a rule that all parcels of one hectare or larger will be mapped). This traditional approach is acceptable for manual mapping using analog aerial photographs but is difficult to apply to raster imagery. Regional analysts will be responsible for defining minimum measurement units, which will generally be larger than a single pixel but no larger than three pixel dimensions on the short axis. Regardless of the minimum measurement unit, change analysis will be conducted pixel by pixel. C-CAP protocol requires that the inherent resolution of the raw data must be retained throughout the classification and change-analysis processes. Aggregation and filtering of pixels should occur only in regard to cartographic presentation of the completed change detection database. Regardless of the techniques employed, the final database should be capable of representing land-cover by class for the base time, land cover by class for each earlier or later time, and land-cover change by class for each change period. The final database should contain the full change matrix (all \"from\" and \"to\" categories) for each change period."}, {"section_title": "Analog (Hardcopy) Cartographic Products", "text": "Hardcopy maps of the final database are not specifically required by C-CAP, but they are certain to be useful when presenting results. Often it is useful to produce a smaller scale regional map (usually requiring some pixel aggregation) that gives an impression of the scope of the effort and to produce several larger scale maps at full resolution that demonstrate the level of detail and highlight notable findings. All maps should come directly from the final database complying with C-CAP protocols, but overlaying or imbedding ancillary data, such as DLG and TIGER data, is encouraged with proper notation. If the statistical summary of changes is present on a map, C-CAP recommends that the numbers included in it always be calculated for the area shown on the map. It is not acceptable to associate the summary of changes for one area (larger or smaller) with a map of another. The statistical summaries of the change detection matrix must always be calculated from the database at full resolution, rather than from the aggregated data of the plot file. It is not advisable to allow the numerical count of class area to float with the level of cartographic aggregation. Unless all counts are based on the full resolution database, some classes composed of small features may disappear at higher levels of aggregation. Map readers may become confused if ma-trix numbers change with aggregation for the same territory. Technically, the minimum cartographic presentation is 1) a map for the base time, 2) a map showing gains by class, and 3) a map showing losses by class. A full classification for the earlier or later (nonbase) time may be useful, but it is not essential to present the matrix of possible changes.

Many of the steps discussed in Chapter 3 to monitor uplands and wetlands are pertinent to monitor SRV However, there are significant differences which cannot be ignored (Table  5). Important considerations include the following: \u2022 mapping SRV is primarily a photogrammetric task, rather than a satellite task, requiring an entirely different sensor system (aircraft, camera filter, and film); \u2022 aerial photography is normally not radiometrically (except for color balance between photographs) or geometrically corrected; \u2022 time of day, sensor altitude, and flightline placement are very flexible, unlike fixed orbit satellite sensor systems; \u2022 numerous environmental conditions must be considered (sea state, water clarity, water depth, low altitude atmospheric conditions) to optimize photography; and \u2022 aerial photographs are in analog format.

At a minimum, regional cooperators are requested to map and conduct change analysis for SRV. Increasing the number of habitat types to be included in the study will be based on local or regional interest and support for the effort. For example, a comprehensive mapping ofSRV, macroalgae, and coral reefs is underway in the Florida Keys (see \"State of Florida, Department of Environmental Protection\")."}, {"section_title": "Ancillary Technologies for Collecting Submersed Habitat Data", "text": "Some successes have been reported with satellite imagery and a number of other technologies in monitoring photic submerged land. Presently, these technologies supplement, and eventually may replace, aerial photography for change detection in SRV. Some of them are briefly mentioned here. Satellite imagery has some advantages and disadvantages compared with photography. Satellite data generally have greater spectral resolution than aerial photography but lesser spatial resolution. Satellite imagery is already in a digital format whereas information derived from aerial photography must eventually be digitized to be quantitatively analyzed. Landsat and SPOT data have been successfully used to inventory some macroalgae such as the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, along southern California shorelines (Jensen et aI., 1980;Augenstein et aI., 1991). In clear shallow tropical waters with highly reflective substrate, Landsat imagery may discriminate sandy from coral reef or seagrass areas (Luczkovich et aI., 1993) or provide an estimate of biomass for unispecific beds of Thalassia testudinum (Armstrong, 1993). In the turbid estuaries of the eastern United States, Landsat and SPOT imagery can be used to detect some (e.g. large, dense, shallow) but not all of the SRV that is visible in the best aerial photography. Aerial photography is, in fact, often used as \"ground truth\" when interpreting satellite imagery. Because of the fixed orbital paths of satellites, it is only fortuitous when a satellite image is acquired under optimum conditions to inventory SRV (see \"Environmental Considerations\"). For these reasons, aerial photography is the C-CAP imagery of choice for comprehensive mapping and change detection (Ferguson and Wood, 1990;Thomas and Ferguson, 1990;Orth etal., 1991;Ferguson et aI., 1992 and. Photo interpretation supported by surface-level signature verification and species identification is qualitatively and spatially more reliable for SRV than are satellite-based methods. Several technologies may provide valuable supplemental data to aerial photographic detection of habitat change. These include closed circuit television (CCTV) on an airplane, small boat, or remotely operated vehicle (ROV), side-scan and down-looking sonar, new satellite sensors, airborne spectral scanners and digital video scanners, and digitized photography.

Second choices are Aerochrome 2448 color-reversal and Aerographic 2405 black-and-white negative film. A haze filter should always be used to minimize the degrading effect of haze on photographic images. We do not recommend infrared film for delineating SRV. In our experience in North Carolina with tandem cameras, Aerochrome 2443 false-color infrared film was much less effective than color film at recording benthic features in shal1ow, moderately turbid water. True color film gives more information than black-and-white or infrared film, is critical for initial mapping attempts in new or unfamiliar areas, and may permit identification of species in some tropical areas. Color negative film also appears to be better than color reversal or black-and-white film for identification of habitat under moderately turbid or hazy conditions. Color transparency prints are dimen-sional1y stable and are most amenable to il1uminating dark areas of the photograph under magnification. Paper prints are not as dimensional1y stable as transparencies (i.e. paper prints are subject to stretching and shrinking) but they are more resistant than transparencies to damage from handling when used for field work."}, {"section_title": "Metric Photography and Photographic Scale", "text": "Metric-quality aerial photographs (~3\u00b0of tilt off-nadir and including camera calibration data) are essential and should be acquired with a protocol similar to that employed by NOAA's Photogrammetry Branch (1980) to produce the highest quality data possible. The need for rectification of photography is minimized by precise control of aircraft altitude and orientation relative to the vertical during photography and by interpretation in stereo. Photography should be obtained at a scale appropriate to the areal extent of habitat, local water conditions, type of habitat being studied, and resolution requirements for the resultant data. Flightlines, Reconnaissance Flights, and Photographic Overlap Flightlines are planned with reference to aeronautical and nautical charts to include all areas known to have, or which potentially could have, SRV. The efficiency of photographic missions can be optimized by minimizing the number offlightlines and by contingency planning. Some airspace is restricted for military or other use, for example, and is indicated on aeronautical charts. Nautical charts provide bathymetric data useful for designating potential habitat areas when combined with local knowledge of the depth of vegetated bottoms. Reconnaissance flights can provide valuable perspective on SRV distribution if timed to optimize visualization of shallow bottoms (see \"Environmental Considerations\"). Ideally, each photograph in a flightline records cultural and shoreline features required to register the image to the base map, about 1/3 of the exposure. This permits correction of photographic scale and orientation to the external reference system. At a scale of 1:24,000 (1 inch = 2,000 ft), a standard 9 x 9 inch aerial photograph has a coverage of 18,000 x 18,000 ft. Large areas (relative to coverage of a single photograph) of open water require parallel flightlines and bridging of the large-scale photography to control points with the small-scale photography, construction of towers, etc., to supplement horizontal control features or inflight CPS positioning of photographic cen ters. Overlap of photographs includes endlap of adjacent photographs along a flightline and sidelap of photographs along parallel flightlines. Sixty percent endlap allows stereoscopic interpretation, facilitates interpretation from the most central region of the photographs, and compensates for loss of coverage due to sun glint in the photographs. (Sun glint is the image of the sun reflected off the surface of the water. See \"Sun Angle.\") Sidelap of 30% ensures contiguous coverage of adjacent flightlines and produces a block of aerial photographs that may be subjected to photogrammetric bundle adjustment if necessary."}, {"section_title": "Environmental Considerations", "text": "Knowledge of the study area that IS Important to a successful project includes the plant species comprising SRV; morphology and phenology of these plants; depth range and location of known habitat; locations with water depth potentially suitable for habitat, types and locations of benthic features that may confuse photo interpretation of SRV; seasonality of turbidity, weather, and haze; daily patterns in wind speed and direction; and progression of sun angle through the day. Primary and secondary seasonal windows and the day and time to conduct photography are selected to optimize the visibility of habitat in the photography. Surface waters in different locations and at different times of the year will be more or less sensitive to turbidity from local runoff, plankton blooms, local resuspension of sediment, and surface waves. Seasonal and daily trends for haze, cloud cover, wind direction, wind duration, and wind velocity should be included in planning for photography. The decisions of when to have the aircraft arrive at the study area (within the seasonal window) and when to collect photography are based on NOS tide tables, local knowledge of factors affecting water clarity and depth, observation of recent weather patterns (precipitation, wind direction, and wind speed), and water clarity. The final decision to photograph includes observations from the air based on the pilot's estimate of haze, cloud cover, and overall visibility. Primary and secondary photographic windows should be one or two months duration to ensure optimal conditions for photography. For single day missions it may be possible to have the plane and flightcrew fly to the study area on the day of photography. In our experience in North Carolina, staging of the plane and flight crews to the study area several times for several days was required to complete missions involving more than one day of actual photography. Phenology-The best time of year to acquire photography is during the season of maximum biomass or flowering of dominant species, considering the phenologic overlap for the entire community. This is June for the SRV of the Pacific Northwest and Atlantic Northeast, April and May for eelgrass in eastern North Carolina, and September for most of the other species of SRV in the eastern United States. Clouds and Haze-It is best to have no clouds and minimal haze. Thin broken clouds or thin overcast above the plane may be acceptable when these are determined by visualization from the air neither to cast shadows nor adversely affect illumination of the study area. Haze reduces illumination and clarity of the image of benthic features being recorded in the photograph. Cooperators are referred to the \"Aerial Photographers Clear Day Map,\" U.S. Department of Commerce, Environmental Data Service. Turbidity-Aerial photography should be conducted when turbidity is low. Care should be exercised in areas adjacent to sources of suspended sediment and nutrients. Data collection should be avoided during seasonal phytoplankton blooms or immediately following heavy rains or persistent strong winds. Potential days for photography are those during the photographic window when high water clarity is expected, based on local experience, recent weather patterns, and surface level observation. The flightcrew should confirm water clarity from the air on the day of photography. Tides-Generally, aerial photography should be collected within \u00b12 hours of the lowest tide predicted by NOS tide tables, although factors affecting water depth and water clarity should be considered simultaneously. In general, extreme low tide, which may be -0.5 to -1.0 m or more around the U.S. coast is preferred, if compatible with other constraints. The significant \"lag\" in the tidal stage of some estuaries should be considered for data acquisition. Wind and Surface Waves-No wind and no waves is best for aerial photography. Low wind (<10 mph) may be acceptable. The direction, persistence, fetch (the distance that wind can blow unobstructed over water), and recent wind events should be taken into account. Breaking waves and associated turbidity, white caps, lines of bubbles, and floating debris should not be visible from the air or in the photographs. For some areas, ocean swell can be an important consideration and should not exceed 3 ft. Sun Angle-Sun angle affects the illumination of benthic features, sun glint, and shadows from tall shoreline features in the photographs. A sun angle of 20-25 0 is optimal to record benthic features (Keller, 1978). A sun angle of 15-30 0 is recommended by C-CAP. This interval maximizes the time for photography considering both the illumination of submerged features and sun glint. Sun angles above 15 0 illuminate the bottom sufficiently for photographic purposes. Sun glint also increases with sun angle but precludes visualization of benthic features where it occurs in the photograph. As sun angle increases, sun glint also increases and moves from the edge toward the center of the photograph. Loss of coverage due to sun glin t at sun angles of up to about 30 0 is compensated (to ensure monoscopic coverage, at a minimum) by the recommended endlap of 60% (see \"Flightlines, Reconnaissance Flights, and Photographic Overlap\"). Eighty percent endlap will improve coverage when high sun angles cannot be avoided. Photography at sun angles above 30 0 is not recommended. Sun glint is minimized when the sun and land are on the same side of the plane because sun glint does not occur on land. Shadows from tall objects on shore such as trees, however, can preclude visualization of benthic features and may be a factor when the land and sun are on the same side of the plane."}, {"section_title": "Photointerpretation of SRV _", "text": "Habitat defined by the presence of SRV can be interpreted from metric-quality aerial photographs exposed as recommended in the previous sections. The accurate identification of SRV in aerial photographs requires visual evaluation of the fundamental elements of image interpretation (tone, color, contrast, texture, shadow, etc.). It also requires extensive experience at ground level in the study area; the photographic images of habitat and nonhabitat features vary in ways which cannot readily be modeled, described, or communicated. Training for a habitat change analysis effort includes literature research; discussions with local ecologists and biologists; site visits on foot, swimming (snorkel or scuba), or small boat; overflights in a small plane; and examination of historical aerial photographs of the area. Training of photo interpreters is active throughout the life of the project. SRV are best observed by using stereo pairs of photographs and high quality stereoscopic instruments (e.g. Wild, AVIOPRET, APT2, stereoscopes). Polygons are traced on overlays fixed to each photograph. To be delineated as habitat, recognizable and verified signa-tures of SRV must be present in the photographs. SRV (and other benthic features) in a given area will present a variety of signatures depending upon the species present, bottom sediment, depth, season, haze, clouds, water clarity and surface disturbances, and sun angle at the time of photography. The designation of a given area as SRV is a function of the minimum detection unit, the minimum mapping unit, and the proximity of the area to other SRV. Assuming a photographic scale of 1:24,000, high quality optics, high resolution film, and ideal conditions (e.g. dense clusters oflarge vigorous shoots growing on light-colored sediment in shallow, clear, calm water), it is usually possible to have a minimum detection unit of approximately 1 m. All detected SRV that appear to be in a continuum with adjacent SRV in an area exceeding 0.03 ha will be mapped as a single. polygon. The minimum mapping unit is the smallest area to be mapped as habitat. At the C-CAP map scale of 1:24,000, the minimum mapping unit is 0.03 ha for SRV (i.e. a diameter of about 0.8 mm on the map represents a diameter of about 20 m or an area of about 0.03 ha on the ground). Therefore, isolated groups of shoots with a diameter of less than 20 m may be detected but not mapped as habitat. The presence of SRV signature in the photograph defines habitat if 1) the total area exceeds 0.03 ha; 2) no unvegetated discontinuities, such as dredged or natural channels, partition the distribution into spatial units less than 0.03 ha; and 3) unvegetated areas between plants are not large relative to the minimum mapping unit. Unfortunately, not all areas of SRV can be detected when photographic conditions are less than ideal. Because of the constraint of the minimum mapping unit and the possibility of suboptimal photography, delineations of SRV will tend to be conservative. The degree of underestimation depends upon the atmospheric and hydrographic conditions at the time of photography, the experience of the photo interpreter, and the nature of the subject area. Optimizing conditions for photography will minimize underestimation of SRV, particularly in areas that are intrinsically more difficult to interpret. Where habitat edges are clearly distinct in superior-quality photography, they may also be detected in inferior-quality photography (e.g. high biomass of SRV along a clear water channel with a steep bank of light-colored sediment). In other cases where the edges are not clearly distinct in superior-quality photography, they are likely to remain undetected in inferior photography (e.g. low biomass of SRV growing on a shallow depth gradien t of deep, turbid water over dark-colored sediment). The deep-water edge of habitat often will be difficult to delineate. This edge may also be at high risk for loss due to degradation in water quality that limits the illumination of the bottom with photosynthetically active radiation. SRV with unrecognized signatures due to poor photographic conditions cannot be mapped as habitat unless the area is rephotographed or additional sources of data are incorporated into the database. When photo interpretation is difficult or not possible, the preferred option is to rephotograph the area under better conditions. Although desirable, this may not be possible. Even under the best photographic conditions, delineation of all or part of some habitat polygons may require additional effort in regard to surface level verification or direct inclusion of surface level data. Polygon borders derived from surface level data must be so designated in the lineage database for \"truth in labeling\" requirements (see \"Digital Product\"). Suitable surface level positioning techniques include CPS or more traditional survey positioning techniques that can be demonstrated to provide the positional accuracy required by C-CAP. Within a polygon of SRV, the extent of bottom coverage by shoots of SRV and the pattern of distribution of the shoots or bed form (e.g. circular, doughnut-shaped, irregular patches, or continuous cover of SRV) reflects the interaction of biotic, physical, and anthropogenic factors. Coverage and bed form can be estimated from aerial photographs but is not a requirement of C-CAP. An example of a coverage index is an adaptation of the crown density scale originally developed to categorize coverage by trees crowns in forests (Orth et aI., 1991). However, coverage indices and bed-form identifications are affected by factors such as water depth and brightness of bottom sediments. The degree of contrast between shoots and exposed sediment and the clarity of the photographic image determines the minimum detection unit of features within SRV. Comparison of habitats with different depths, water clarity, or substrate brightness, therefore, is problematic. Analysis of change over time at a given location may be useful but requires consistent photographic conditions and field verification. Changes in coverage or bed form over time in a given location may indicate changing conditions in that habitat polygon or disturbances, such as scarring by boat propellers. Some data including species, biomass, productivity, functional status, and health of SRV may not be interpretable from the aerial photographs. Species identification is not possible from aerial photography in temperate areas such as North Carolina and the Chesapeake Bay. In some tropical areas, species distributions and photographic signatures may be sufficiently distinct to discriminate by species."}, {"section_title": "Field Surveys Species and Habitat at Randomly Selected Stations", "text": "Once selected by stratified random sampling of potential habitat, stations are observed for SRV species and the presence or absence of aquatic beds during the same season and preferably within one year of the photography. Stations are stratified by water depth and water body. Water depth determines if sampling can be accomplished by wading, snorkeling, or scuba diving. Clear water with a bottom depth of~2.5 m or somewhat shallower turbid water may require scuba. Stratification permits flexibility in sampling intensity and effort (sampling by scuba requires special training and resources and takes about twice the time per station). Bathymetry and reference coordinates in NOAA nautical charts of the study area facilitate selection and positioning of stations. Navigation to stations is with GPS. The spatial density of points is adjusted according to the resources and scale of the project (e.g. an average of 1.5 to 2.5 nmi from station to station in North Carolina). Great care is taken to include all locations of potential habitat in the surface level survey. SRV are limited to water depths less than about 2 m at mean lower low water (MLLW) for Chesapeake Bay. A similar depth limit was determined for that habitat in eastern North Carolina. To determine that depth in North Carolina, potential habitat was sampled to water depths of 10 ft MLLW (Ferguson andWood, 1990, 1994). SRVare not known to occur seaward of the barrier islands in North Carolina. In sharp contrast, the maximum depth for SRV is 9 m off the northwest coast of Florida. The presence or absence of aquatic beds and species of SRV are determined within an area equal to the minimum mapping unit and centered around the nominal station location. If SRV are present, visual observations of the number, size, and distribution of groups of plant shoots are recorded. These data are translated into an assessment of the presence or absence of an aquatic bed at the station considering the spatial distribution of SRV relative to the minimum detection and mapping units. The goal is to assess presence data in a manner relevant to photo interpretation (see \"Photo interpretation of SRV\"). Ancillary data recorded are water depth, salinity, water clarity, latitude and longitude, and descriptions of benthic sediment, algae, animals or animal shells, boulders, etc. A GPS position fix is taken to be differentially corrected (postprocessing) to a CEP of \u00b15 m. If the station data are not required to verify photo interpretation (see below), they can be used to estimate the accuracy of the habitat data (see \"Recommended Accuracy Assessment Test\")."}, {"section_title": "Signature Verification and Supplemental Spatial Data", "text": "Locations selected from the photographs are observed during the same season and within one year of the photographic mission.

The base map and the registration technology may vary regionally."}, {"section_title": "Planimetric Base Maps", "text": "The accuracy of the base map used for local horizontal control places a limit on the accuracy of the C-CAP product. The two base maps broadly available are NOAA shoreline and USGS 7.5' topographic maps. NOS produces highly accurate shoreline maps based on tidecoordinated and fully rectified photography (Swanson, 1949;Ellis, 1978;Slamma, 1980;OAA Photogrammetry Branch, 1989;Crowell et aI., 1991). When available and current, NOAA shoreline and coastal data should be used for C-CAP projects (e.g. Ferguson et aI., 1991). These data, available in graphic and digital form, are products of the NOAA Coastal Mapping Program and are available from NOS. Shoreline data are produced from tide-coordinated photographic data and ground level survey data by the Photogrammetry Branch of NOS and meet or exceed national map accuracy standards. Horizontal ground control meets or exceeds third-order class I specifications found in the geodetic control standards (Federal Geodetic Control Committee, 1984). The Coastal Mapping Project of the Photogrammetry Branch provides data that depict the delineation of the mean high water line, the limit of emergent vegetation (apparent shoreline) and/or cultural shoreline, and in some areas, e.g. orth Carolina, the approximate MLLW line. NOS shoreline data are a data source for NOAA nautical charts and USGS topographic maps. Coverage of the U.S. coastline is not complete, however, and for some areas the data may be dated. In some locations, USGS 7.5' topographic maps may be the only base maps available at a scale of 1:24,000. These maps delineate the high tide line and cultural features and may meet GCAP requirements. In many instances, however, these maps are out ofdate and temporal changes in shorelines may cause problems in the application of local horizontal control to compile the habitat polygons (Ferguson et aI., 1989;Ferguson and Wood, 1990). This can reduce the positional and scaling accuracy of habitat data which is critical for change analysis (see \"Recent Photography\"). Care should be taken to determine the effective date of coastal features in these maps. Updates of these maps generally include cultural but not natural changes in shoreline. Coverage of the coastal United States is almost comprehensive, but dated. In some coastal areas, 1:24,000 scale orthophotoquads have been published as an alternative to topographic maps. Orthophotoquads at a scale of 1:24,000 are unsatisfactory for compilation from aerial photography in remote areas. Orthophotoquads do not have delineated shorelines, which may be needed when the preferred cultural features are insufficient to register the photograph to the map base."}, {"section_title": "Transfer of Polygons to the Map Coordinate Projection System", "text": "Polygons of habitat interpreted from aerial photographs are mapped into a standard map projection coordinate system. The UTM projection is recommended. C-CAP protocol allows the polygons interpreted from aerial photography to be transferred onto planimetrically accurate basemaps using three approaches: 1) Stereoscopically interpret the photographs and optically scale the polygons and photographic image to fit planimetric horizontal control in the basemap with a zoom transfer scope. This is the least expensive and often the most reliable approach. Habitat delineations drawn at the photographic scale through stereo viewing under magnification are transferred using camera lucida principles from the photographic overlay directly onto the planimetric base map. 2) Process the aerial photographs into planimetrically accurate orthophotographs, and interpret and directly trace habitat polygons onto the planimetric base map. Interpretation of the orthophotographs is performed using monoscopic airphoto interpretation techniques. The orthophotographs must be at the same scale as the base map or the images must be enlarged or reduced to the map scale. This approach applies orthophotographic rectification (Thrower and Jensen, 1976), which corrects relief displacement in the original photographs and ensures planimetric mapping results in the database. Some loss of detail may occur since the orthophotography is a generation away from the original aerial photography. The process is expensive but accuracy is improved in areas with substantial vertical relief. 3) Delineate and simultaneously rectify and digitize habitat polygons by using an analytical stereo plotter. The three-dimensional stereo model of the aerial photographs is leveled and scaled in the analytical plotter (AP) and the interpreter views a three-dimensional landscape during photo interpretation. All polygonal interpretations are automatically stored in digital x,y coordinates in their proper planimetric position during photo interpretation (Welch et aI., 1992), avoiding any error that might arise during information transfer in methods 1 and 2 discussed above. The polygon data are registered and digitized without the errors that are associated with transfer in a zoom transfer scope or by hand digitization. Unfortunately, analytical stereoplotters are expensive and their use requires special training. Some additional expense to locate x, y, and z control points may be necessary to successfully level the block of aerial photography. Recent advances in softcopy photogrammetry allow analytical stereoplotter functions to be accomplished using UNIX type workstations and image processing software (e.g. ERDAS ORTHO-max). Therefore, this alternative will become more affordable and attractive in the future. An adaptation of the third approach is being tested by NOAA and the State of Florida. Photo interpretation is done as in approach 1. Registration and digitization of the interpreted habitat polygons is completed in the AP. Due to the high expense of AP and the specialization of AP technicians, this option may be feasible for processing data from SRV interpreters who do not have direct access to or training on an AP."}, {"section_title": "Digitization of Habitat Polygons _", "text": "Habitat polygons that have been transferred to the planimetric base map according to procedure 1 or 2 above require digitization to be incorporated into the C-CAP spatial data base. Normally, digitization is accomplished using a digitizing tablet. Polygons are digitized with a digitizing table in point mode. The overlays are labeled according to the base map. Compilations are checked for clear delineation and cartographic acceptability ofline work, existence of and consistency in feature attributes, and adequacy of horizontal control points. Compilations are checked along neat lines to confirm edgeline match and label match for polygons extending over adjoining maps. Any inconsistencies are brought to the attention of the map author. Compilations are affixed to a digitizing table for georeferencing and data entry. The accuracy of the reference points, the four corners of the neat line, and no less than four internal tick marks on the overlays are checked to ensure that control points are within \u00b1O.02 inches. This translates to \u00b140 ft or \u00b112.2 m from its stated location. If tolerance is exceeded on anyone point, new control points are selected, digitized, and reevaluated until all points test within tolerance. Information regarding the georeferencing error for each control point is recorded on a documentation form. In addition the technician records other information about the overlay manuscript such as scale, size, media type, source map information, and author. Polygons are digitized with the cartographic style and accuracy that is represented on the source manuscript. A technician perfonns digitizing and data processing to map completion, including matching edgelines, preparing initial check plots, and reviewing, editing, and preparing final check plots. All linework and labeling are reviewed using check plots produced at the source map scale. Each arc is checked for acceptance on a light table with the final check plot overlaid on the source map. Digitized linework should conceal original linework with exceptions for difference in line thickness, differences in media, and subtle differences of horizontal control on the source map and in digital files. Unacceptable data is flagged, edited, and reviewed prior to acceptance into the digital database. A data layer specification form is com pleted for fonnal documentation at the conclusion of all digitizing. Scan digitizing may be an acceptable alternative to hand digitizing and could be applied at one of two stages: 1) when polygons are positioned on overlays of base maps or 2) when polygons are interpreted from individual photographs. Large format scanners would be required to scan an entire map, approximately 19 x 23 inch, in one pass. A standard desktop scanner, 8.5 x 11 inch, could scan the overlay from a single 9 x 9 inch photograph. In the latter case, geopositioning might be accomplished digitally without the use of the zoom transfer scope. In either case, the digital product would have to meet the same positional tolerances described above for data entered with the digitizing tablet."}, {"section_title": "Change Detection With Aerial Photographic Data _", "text": "The C-CAP objective of site-specific change detection places greater emphasis on accuracy and precision of spatial data than required in one-time inventories or regional summaries of change.

Postclassification change detection can be accomplished graphically, or polygons may be digitized and compared by using a geographic information system to detect spatial displacement and to quantify change. Although simple in concept, the statistics of change analysis are not well understood. Development of consensus for statistical evaluation of qualitative or spatial change is a subject of ongoing C-CAP research. As an expedient to postclassification change detection, photographs from different years are compared directly or with mapped pOlygons. By using such comparisons, areas where change may have occurred can be identified rapidly but subjectively.

Prior to 1960, virtually all aerial photographs were black and white. Incomplete coverage, lack of coordination with tide, lack of camera calibration data, inappropriate scale, sun angle, and inappropriate time of year, or poor quality for visualization of benthic features often make these photographs unacceptable for a C-CAP change analysis. Interpretation of historical photographs is likely to proceed with limited or no concurrent surface level information for signature verification and should be attempted only by interpreters with extensive experience in the study area. Unless historical photography meets the C-CAP requirements listed in \"Aerial Photography of SRV\" and is supported by surface level data as discussed in \"Field Surveys,\" the historical presence or absence of SRV at a given location may remain an open question. Some but not all SRV can be identified in less than optimal photography and be confirmed in the literature or in the memory of local residents. A visible signature for \"bare bottom\" or another non habitat signature is required to interpret absence of habitat at the time of photography. As a result, documentation of loss may be more likely than documentation of gain of SRV with historical photography. Historical photographs may contain limited but valuable information on presence of submersed habitat other than SRY. Canopies of the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, for example, are readily discernible in color infrared (IR) photography because they have very high IR reflectance against a background of water that has no reflectance. The ease of photo interpretation of some macroalgae allows historical photography to be used to identify this and perhaps other types of habitat. The most complete and general.

That study demonstrated~he feasibility of monitoring spatial change in SRV using C-CAP guidelines for large-scale metric aerial photography, photo interpretation, geographic positioning, and postclassification change detection techniques. Aerochrome MS 2448 color-reversal film was exposed in March 1985 at 1:20,000 and 1: 12,000 scales. Aerocolor 2445 color-negative film was exposed at 1:24,000 scale in April 1988. All aerial photography was obtained by the NOS Photogramme try Branch. The photography was coordinated with low tide and sun angle and was collected with minimal haze, no clouds below the aircraft, and no visible shadows from high clouds. Water was essentially free of white caps and clear enough for identification of vegetated and shallow unvegetated bottoms. Episodic wind, haze, local turbidity, and airborne pollen often precluded photography for one or more days. The sun angle during photography ranged from 15 to 30'. This sun angle localized sun glare to one edge of the photography while presenting illumination below the wa-ter surface. The aerial photographs were interpreted stereoscopically and the polygons were transferred to planimetric NOS shoreline maps with a zoom transfer scope. A graphical postclassification overlay approach was used to visually identify changes between years (Fig. 17). A gray tone in the chart indicates habitat present in 1985 but not in 1988. Light green indicates habitat in 1988 but not in 1985. The overlay of gray and green indicates the presence of seagrass habitat in both 1985 and 1988. Summary statistics, obtained via automated geometric analysis of digitized video images of individual polygons (pixel size <0.03 ha) revealed that seagrass habitat is a major resource in the study area, comprising about 35% of the subtidal land. Total area of habitat changed less than 6%, from 7,030 ha in 1985 to 6,637 ha in 1988. Polygons along the mainland and Harkers Island tended to be linear and close to shore. Large broad areas of seagrass habitat were present in the subtidal shallows east of Browns Island, north of Shackleford Banks, and west of Core Banks. The total number of habitat polygons was similar in the two years, 151 in 1985 and 149 in 1988. Reliability of detected change was conducted by reinspection of the photography and is summarized in Ferguson et al. (1993). Some areas of detected change were confirmed by surface-level observations and two of these were associated with known anthropogenic disturbances. Some areas of detected change were confirmed but could not be associated with potential causes. Still others could not be confirmed, which may have been the result of variable quality in the photography. In a continuation of this study, the study area was rephotographed in 1992, selected polygons were mapped with GPS at surface level during the 1992 photographic window, and surface-level verification of signature was completed in 1993.

In land-cover databases, polygons are derived either from raster spectral data representing discrete pixels or from closed polygons delineating the edges of spectral signatures in photographs. In the first case, the placement of polygon boundaries depends on a) selection of spectral signatures for class boundaries and b) registration of pixel locations. The second case generally applies to C-CAP SRV projects in which the primary intent is to delineate limits between presence and absence of habitat classes. In this application, polygons of class 1 tend to occur as discrete objects in a large polygon of class 0 that has specified boundaries landward and unspecified boundaries seaward. In addition, one or more polygons of class 0 may be included within a polygon of class 1. The placement of polygon boundaries depends on a) limits of signatures attrib-uted to the habitat class and b) registration of horizontal control points present in the base map and visible in the photography. In both cases, signature selection directly affects attribute distribution which, in turn, affects the size and shape of polygons. This effect is most common at polygon edges but may occur throughout the polygon, for example, as internal voids or as circumscribed polygons of different classes. The selection of spectral signatures for class boundaries is similar to the task of generalization that cartographers have traditionally faced in deciding where to draw boundaries between land-cover features. For most remote-sensing applications, positional accuracy on the order of\u00b1I-2 pixels has not been a major concern. Neither has positional accuracy for photographic delineations of submersed habitat been a major concern or a subject of independent verification. For a single time period, positional errors may not greatly affect the aggregate area of each land-cover type. Positional errors may be difficult to detect even when a specific polygon in the field is visited. For C-CAP, however, positional accuracy is a crucial concern (Ferguson et aI., 1992 and. The change database amounts to a comparison that will conspicuously record positional errors of one or more pixel dimensions in the satellite imagery and errors in excess of about 10 m in the photographic images used to delineate submersed habitat. This compounds the problem of recognizing real changes, which also tend to concentrate at polygon edges and class boundaries. The registration of pixel locations is a purely geometric problem which has been greatly improved with recent advances in sensors, CPS, and image processing systems. Many vendors claim a positional accuracy of \u00b10.5 pixel root mean square error (RMSE) for commercial image processing systems and a CEP of 3-5 m for CPS. Selective availability (SA, the intentional distortion of CPS signals for military security purposes) reduces CPS precision to a CEP of 40 m when SA is in operation. Differential readings by multiple receivers can improve the quality of positional data, even when SA is active, to a CEP of <5 m. C-CAP regional analysts should verify vendor claims to their own satisfaction based on sources of higher precision. Unless stated otherwise, a geometric registration of \u00b1O.5 pixel RMSE will be assumed for all C-CAP regional databases (\u00b115 m ifLandsat TM data are used). For submerged land, the registration of polygon edges is a function of the metric quality of photographs, methods used to transfer the information to a planimetric map projection, and quality of the digitization performed. Positional accuracy is therefore subject to the accuracy of the base map including deviations not only between the source photography and the base map but also actual changes in the study area in the time be-tween aerial photography for the base map and for the submersed habitat. A positional accuracy that meets national map accuracy standards is assumed for submersed habitat data. At the compilation scale of 1:24,000 this amounts to \u00b1I3.3 m on the ground, close to the \u00b1I5 meter precision of Landsat TM data for uplands and wetlands."}, {"section_title": "Generalization Versus Error _", "text": "It is a tribute to the power of modern information technologies that what we used to call generalization, we now call error. With analog maps it has always been necessary to use human judgment in deciding, for example, precisely where a forest becomes a field. In reality most forests have some grass, and most fields have some trees or shrubs. In natural circumstances the boundary is not a precise line but rather a \"fuzzy\" zone of highly variable width in which the predominan t land cover grades from one class to another. Scale and resolution are crucial determinants of such boundaries. In an analog map, scale limits the feasibility of drawing the densities and convolutions oflines that would be necessary to represent each patch of forest or each individual tree. Conceptually there will always be unrepresented boundaries because, in the modern sense of fractals, a nearly infinite number of convolutions are possible. Digital systems are capable of representing a much larger portion of all possible boundaries, but there are practical limitations affecting digital systems as well. In current technology the most often encountered limitation is the established resolution of satellite sensors. While the terms \"error\" and \"accuracy\" are frequently used in regard to generalized boundaries, conceptually the \"accurate\" boundary can only be determined on the basis of a highly specific set of criteria that goes far beyond what can actually be implemented for large areas. Land-cover phenomena are prime examples of fuzzy sets. This fuzzy characteristic is explicitly recognized in the procedures of image processing (for example, the use of maximum-likelihood statistics), but the remote-sensing community traditionally has presumed that a \"right\" answer or \"ground truth\" can be determined if the analyst can get close enough to see the polygon and its boundary in the field or on the photograph. Yet different investigators \"see\" different land covers, a problem that is especially troublesome when the area is large enough to require multiple teams. In reality, land-cover phenomena are fuzzy sets whether viewed directly in the field or through remote sensors. Fuzziness persists because each class is defined, not by a discrete boundary, but by factors that grade from one class to another-spatially, temporally, categorically, and observationally. Also, classification and accuracy assess-ment procedures are not always implemented in a timely manner but often months or years after the image is collected or analyzed. Generalization also occurs within delineated polygons whether derived from satellite or photographic images. In both cases a finite limit for signature detection and mapping exists. Minimum detection units are one pixel for spectral scanner data and about one meter for high altitude photographic images. Elimination of \"salt and pepper\" and preservation of reasonable accuracy for perimeter or areal estimates requires a minimum mapping unit of 4 pixels or about 0.4 ha. At a compilation scale of 1:24,000 the smallest polygon that can be traced from a photograph is about 20 m in diameter or an effective area on the ground of about 0.03 ha. Realistically, the goal for improving generalization should be to strive for cOQsistency more than \"accuracy. \" Reference data for accuracy assessment must have a resolution and reliability that meet or exceed those of the C-CAP remotely sensed data. The reliability, including attribute and positional accuracy, must be demonstrated prior to its qualification as reference data for C-CAP. Reference data, including surface level observations, must be evaluated in accordance with C-CAP's minimum detection unit and minimum mapping unit for the remote data and with the classification system used to categorize the habitat. The presence of a characteristic species or natural or cultural feature mayor may not, in itself, establish an area as a particular type of habitat. A number of questions need to be answered to conclude the appropriate category of land cover to assign based on the reference data: Does a characteristic species or feature meet the minimum detection unit of the remote sensor? What other characteristic species or features also are present within the minimum mapping unit? and What conclusion can be drawn from the reference data as to the C-CAP category for a given location based upon data generalized to the minimum detection and minimum mapping units?"}, {"section_title": "Attribute Accuracy and Precision _", "text": "Attribute accuracy is a measure of the probability that the land-cover type for any given polygon is properly identified according to the land-cover scheme.

If 15% of all sample polygons for this class are misclassified as \"Deciduous Woody Wetland\" and other categories, the categorical accuracy for the \"High-Intensity Developed\" class is 85%. The remote-sensing literature is replete with procedures for measuring attribute accuracy . Generally, these procedures serve well for current time periods and for relatively small study areas.

C-CAP has conducted three workshops on accuracy assessment and sponsored two protocol development projects in the hope of devising new procedures that will work for accuracy assessment of large land-cover change databases. Nevertheless, the following material identifies sound procedures that may be used to obtain unbiased field information which, in turn, may be statistically evaluated to perform an accuracy assessment for a single time period. This is a blind field test in which the field mapping personnel will not see the C-CAP Land-Cover and Land-Cover-Change Maps until all mapping has been completed. Since the field mapping personnel may be unfamiliar with C-CAP, it is advised that they be required to submit a memorandum stating the design of the field mapping implementation. Early in the effort, regional analysts should review the design, in collaboration with NOAA, and reach agreement with the field mapping personnel regarding final implementation. Field personnel should be provided copies of the land-cover classification scheme and should be trained in its use. The field personnel will be responsible for ensuring the positional accuracy and precision of each sample site and each land-cover class boundary within each site. Field personnel will be responsible for determining physical accessibility and obtaining permission for legal access to the sample sites. An early determination will be made regarding who is responsible for acquiring the best available aerial photographs, topographic maps, and other collateral data to ensure an accurate mapping of each sample site for each time period. These materials will assist in mapping land cover and land-cover change for each site at 1:24,000 scale. Positional accuracy shall comply with national map accuracy standards. The determination of class type will be based primarily on field observation. The determination of class areas and boundaries will be based primarily on aerial photographs. The final results for each sample polygon will be provided in a digital form. After completing field mapping, regional analysts will compare the generated map for each sample site with the C-CAP map for the same site. All discrepancies will be referred back to the field mapping personnel for a final check. The regional analyst may request a special examination and may accompany the field mapping personnel for a final reconciliation of any discrepancies for which field error is suspected. The regional analysts will compile the results of all sample polygon comparisons and conduct a statistical analysis. The results of this analysis will be provided to the field mapping personnel for review and comment. At this point the field mapping personnel may also see the C-CAP land-cover and land-cover-change maps for the sample quadrangles. The field mapping personnel will provide a brief documentation of the field mapping task for inclusion in the final accuracy assessment report to be prepared by the regional analysts. The field mapping personnel must be given an opportunity to comment on the results of the final statistical analysis if they so choose."}, {"section_title": "Accuracy Assessment for Individual Date Classification of Water and Submerged Land Data", "text": "Accuracy assessment for submersed habitat is similar to that for emergent and upland habitat but it should be noted that data for submersed habitat is intrinsically vector, not raster. Positional accuracy of polygon borders and attribute accuracy of a poin t location can both be assessed. Habitat polygons or areas of potential habitat should be stratified by class and region (water body) and randomly selected. Additional sample locations from potential habitat sites (i.e. sites of suitable depth but apparently devoid of habitat) should be randomly selected. Verification locations should be identified by latitude and longitude coordinates and visited in the field with CPS navigation. The nature of the habitat, if present, should be documented by inspection or sampling if necessary and the position of the sample or observation recorded to a CEP of <5 m. The entire perimeter ofa small polygon or a section, e.g. 0.5 km of the perimeter of a large polygon, should be positioned by differentially corrected CPS at a point spacing of 3 to 20 m depending upon the degree of curvature in the perimeter. Differential CPS provides CEP of <5 m for single position fixes. C-CAP projects found that single point differential CPS position fixes did not exceed 10 m (Ferguson, R. L.,J. A. Scope, and L. L. Wood, unpublished data). Habitats at the minimum mapping limit, i.e. with diameters on the order of 20 m, therefore, should be located and delineated with multiple position estimates. CPS manufacturers recommend collection of multiple position fixes for a time period of about 4 min to achieve CEP on the order of 1 or 2 m with differentially collected CPS. Multiple position fixes obtained at strategic points around the perimeter of the smallest mapped polygons would be required to ensure mapping the polygon rather than generating a scattered pattern of points."}, {"section_title": "Accuracy Assessment for Land-Cover Change Data", "text": "The methodological difficulties of accuracy assessmen t for the final change map are significantly greater than those for a single, current database. Remote-sensing, cartographic, and geographic literature provide no guidance on techniques for assessing the accuracy of a change detection map (Lunetta et al., 1991;Jensen and Narumalani, 1992). Even for a single-time database, existing procedures are ineffective for past land cover since the recommended \"source of higher accuracy\" cannot include actual field verification. Change detection databases compound the difficulty because they always include a past time period and a large number of \"from\" and \"to\" categories (potentially the square of the number of categories for each time). This large change matrix can make accuracy assessment more expensive than the original classification and change detection effort. Furthermore, if the distribution of error is thoroughly depicted by class and position, the accuracy database may be as large as the thematic database itself. Even worse, both the distribution of error and the distribution of actual change tend to concentrate on the same circumstances (for example, polygon edges and transitional classes, such as marsh and palustrine forest).

This initial prototype and proof-of-principle was conducted at the Oak Ridge Geographics Laboratory. All cartographic and geographic information processing was conducted by ORNL personnel using Oak Ridge Geographics software. Tentative land-cover classes were determined on the basis of supervised training samples in areas of known land cover. The tentative classes were checked with information available from other sources such as 1:24,000 USGS topographic maps and wetlands inventories (NWI and county marsh inventories). Investigators visited the area on 4-6 November 1985 for field verification of the tentative classes and for identification of additional training samples in the Wachapreague, Metomkin Inlet, and Saxis areas of Virginia. Land-cover classes were determined through iterative refinement of supervised training samples. Investigators visited the area in August 1986 for field verification of final land-cover classes in the York River estuary of Virginia and the Tangier Island and Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge areas of Maryland. Finally, the entire dataset was compared digitally on a cell-by-cell basis to land-cover data from the USGS Land Use Data Analysis (LUDA) database in order to resolve certain classes.

This category may contain vegetation that grows as fallow if vigorous growth persists due to the residual effects of management practices in the nonfallow state."}, {"section_title": "lA-Woody Land", "text": "The Woody Land class includes any species with an aerial stem that persists for more than one season. The class is divided into three subclasses: 1.41-Deciduous, 1.42-Evergreen, and 1.43-Mixed. 1.41-Deciduous-The Deciduous Woody subclass includes all forest and shrub areas having a predominance of trees and shrubs that lose their leaves or needles at the end of the frostfree season or at the beginning of a dry season. Areas in this category are composed of greater than two-thirds deciduous trees and shrubs. The Deciduous Woody category can be divided into two groups: 1.411-Forest and 1.412-Scrub/Shrub. 1.411-Forest-Deciduous Forest includes areas dominated by single stemmed, woody vegetation unbranched 2-3 ft above the ground having a height~6 m (20 ft). Forest Deciduous Woody areas have a tree-crown areal density (crown closure percentage) of~lO percent, are stocked with trees capable of producing timber or other wood products, and exert an influence on the climate or water regime. In most parts of the United States, these would be the hardwoods such as oak, Quercus, maple, Aeer, or hickory, Carya, and the \"soft\" hardwoods, such as aspen, Populus tremuloides. Tropical hardwoods are included in the Evergreen Forest (Woody Land) category (1.421). Deciduous forest types characteristic of Wetland, such as tupelo, Nyssa, or cottonwoods, Populus deltoides, are not included in this category. 1.412-Scrub/Shrub-Deciduous Scrub/Shrub includes all areas having a predominance of shrub that lose their leaves or needles at the end of the frost-free season or at the beginning of the dry season (Anderson et aI., 1976). This category contains vegetation that is <6 m (20 ft) in height. The species include true shrubs, young trees, and trees or shrubs that are small or stunted because of environmental conditions. True shrubs are those woody-stemmed species that exhibit several erect, spreading, or prostrate stems and a general bushy appearance. Shrub Lands may represent a successional stage leading to forests or they may be relatively stable communities. Forest regrowth composed ofyoung trees <6 m tall is also included in this category. 1.42-Evergreen-The Evergreen Woody subclass contains forests and shrubs that do not lose their leaves or needles at the end of a frost-free season or at the beginning of a dry season. The Evergreen Woody category is subdivided into two additional categories: 1.421-Forest and 1.422-Scrub/Shrub. 1.421-Forest-Evergreen Forest includes areas in which 67% of the trees remain green throughout the year. Both coniferous and broad-leaved evergreens are included in this category. Coniferous evergreens predominate except in tropical regions where broad-leaved evergreens are indigenous. Coniferous evergreens, often called softwoods, include such eastern species as the longleaf pine, Pinus palustris, slash pine, P. ellioti, shortleaf pine, P. echinata, loblolly pine, P. taeda, and other southern yellow pines; various spruces, Picea, and balsam fir, Abies balsamea; white pine, P. strobus, red pine, P. resinosa, and jack pine, P. banksiana; and hemlock, Tsuga canadensis; and such western species as Douglas fir, Pseudotsuga menziesii, redwood, Sequoia sempervirens, ponderosa pine, P. monticola, Sitka spruce, P. sitchensis, Engelmann spruce, P. engelmanni, western redcedar, Thuja plicata, and western hemlock, Tsuga heterophylla. Evergreen species commonly associated with Wetland, such as tamarack, Larix laricina, or black spruce, P. mariana, are not included in this category. 1.422-Scrub/Shrub-Evergreen Scrub/Shrub includes areas in which~67% of the shrubs remain green throughout the year. Anderson et al. (1976) states \"Both coniferous and broad-leaved evergreens are included in this category. The typical Shrub Lands are found in those arid and semiarid regions characterized by such xerophytic vegetative types with woody stems as big sagebrush, Artemisia tridentata, shadscale, Atriplex confertifolia, greasewood, Sarcobatus vermiculatus, and creosotebush, Larrea divaricata. When bottom lands and moist flats are characterized by dense stands of typical wetland species... they are considered Wetland. Where highly alkaline soils are presen t, halophytes such as desert saltbush, Atriplex may occur. The type, density, and association of these various species are useful as indicators of the local hydrologic and pedologic environments. Also included in this category is chaparral, a dense mixture of broadleaf evergreen sclerophyll shrubs, and the occurrences of mountain mahogany, Cercocarpus ledifolius and scrub oaks, Quercus.\" 1.43-Mixed-The Mixed Woody class includes all forest and shrub areas where both evergreen and deciduous trees and shrubs grow and neither predominates. When evergreen and deciduous species each respectively occupy~33 % of an area, the land is classified as Mixed Woody. The Mixed Woody category is subdivided into two additional categories: 1.431-Forest and 1.432-Scrub/Shrub. 1.431 Forest-This class includes all forested areas where both evergreen and deciduous trees are growing and neither predominate. 1.432 Scrub/Shrub-This class includes all shrub areas where both evergreen and deciduous shrubs are growing and neither predominate."}, {"section_title": "1.5-Bare Land", "text": "The Bare Land class, modified from \"Barren Land\" in Anderson et al. (1976) is composed of bare rock, sand, silt, gravel, or other earthen material with little or no vegetation regardless ofits inherent ability to support life. Vegetation, if present, is more widely spaced and scrubby than that in the vegetated categories. Unusual conditions, such as a heavy rainfall, occasionally may result in a short-lived, luxuriant plant cover. Wet, nonvegetated exposed lands are included in the wetland categories. Categories of Bare Land include Dry Salt Flats; Beaches; Sandy Areas other than Beaches; Bare Exposed Rock; Strip Mines, Quarries; Gravel Pits; Transitional Areas; and Mixed Barren Land: Dry Salt Flats are level bottoms of interior desert basins that capture infrequent rainfall and do not qualify as Wetland. Salt concentrations result in highly reflective surfaces. Beaches are the smooth sloping accumulations of sand and gravel along shorelines. The inland face is usually stable, but the shoreward face is subject to erosion by wind and water and subject to deposition in protected areas. Sandy Areas other than Beaches are composed primarily of dunes-accumulations of sand transported by the wind. Sand accumulations most commonly are found in deserts although they also occur on coastal plains, river flood plains, and deltas and in periglacial environments. When such sand accumulations are encountered in tundra areas, they are not included here but are placed in the Bare Ground Tundra category. Bare Exposed Rock includes areas of bedrock, desert pavement, scarps, talus, slides, volcanic material, glacial debris, and other accumulations of rock without vegetative cover, with the exception of such rock exposures in tundra regions. Strip Mines, Quarries, and Gravel Pits are areas of extractive mining activities with significant surface expression. Vegetative cover and overburden are removed to expose such deposits as coal, iron ore, limestone, and copper. Quarrying of building and decorative stone and recovery of sand and gravel deposits also result in large open-surface pits. Active, inac-tive, and un reclaimed strip mines, quarries, borrow pits, and gravel pits are included in this category until other cover has been established, after which the land is classified in accordance with the resulting cover. Unused pits or quarries that have been flooded, however, are placed in the appropriate Water category. Transitional Areas are dynamically changing from one land cover to another, often because of land use activities. This transitional phase occurs when, for example, forest lands are cleared for agriculture and wetlands are drained for development. Often land becomes temporarily bare as construction initiates the transition from Woody Land or Grassland to a future cover associated with residen tial, commercial, or other intensive land use. Lands, such as spoil banks and sanitary landfills, that are temporarily altered by grading and filling are considered transitional."}, {"section_title": "1.6-Tundra", "text": "Tundra is the term applied to the treeless cover beyond the latitudinal limit of the boreal forest in poleward regions and above the elevation range of the boreal forest in high mountains. In the United States, tundra is found primarily in Alaska, several areas of the western high mountain ranges, and isolated enclaves in the high mountains of New England and northern New York. The vegetative cover of the tundra is low and dwarfed, often forming a continuous mat. Plant characteristics are an adaptation to an extreme physical environment in which temperatures may average above freezing only one or two months of each year, strong desiccating winds may occur, great variation exists in solar energy, and permafrost is ubiquitous beneath the surface. The number of species in the flora is relatively small compared with typical middle-and low-latitude flora, and the number decreases as the environment becomes more severe with increasing latitude and elevation. The tundra vegetation is most luxuriant near the boreal forest. Conversely, plant density and species diversity are lowest near the boundaries of permanent ice and snow areas, where only isolated patches of vegetation occur on generally bare surfaces. Tundra may be further subdivided into Shrub and Brush Tundra, Herbaceous Tundra, Bare Ground Tundra, Wet Tundra, and Mixed Tundra (Anderson et aI., 1976)."}, {"section_title": "1.7-SnowlIce", "text": "The temporal dimension is crucial in determining snow and ice cover. Any snowfall, for example, deep enough to conceal another land cover, no matter how briefly, comprises the visible surface at that time and technically constitutes the land cover for the period of its duration. As a practical matter, of course, analysts usually need to characterize the land cover persisting for a greater portion of the year. At higher latitudes and elevations, snow and ice persist for greater portions of the year, and seasonal coverage becomes a more important concern. At extreme latitudes and elevations, Pe-rennial Snow/Ice cover is of paramount interest. A combination of environmental factors may cause snow and ice to survive the summer melting season. Areas of Perennial Snow/Ice cover are defined as those where snow, firn (coarse, compacted granular snow), or ice accumulation exceeds ablation. Ablation is the combined loss of snow or ice mass by evaporation and meltwater run-off (Anderson et aI., 1976). The class Snow/Ice contains two subclasses: 1.71-Perennial Snow/Ice and l.72-Glacier. 1.71-Perennial Snow/Ice-This class contains areas covered year-round with snow and ice but which have not accumulated sufficient ice to be considered Glaciers. Snowfields can be extensive and thus representative of a regional climate, or can be isolated and localized, where they are known by various terms, such as snowbanks. The regional snowline is controlled by general climatic conditions and closely parallels the regional 32' F (0' C) isotherm for the average temperature of the warmest summer month. The use of the term \"line\" is somewhat misleading because the \"snowline\" represents an irregular transitional boundary, which is determined at any single location by the combination of snow accumulation, snow melt, and ablation, variables that can change rapidly within short distances because of changes in local topography and slope orientation. Snowfields normally can be distinguished from the following Glacier subclass by their relative lack of flow fcatures (Anderson et aI., 1976). 1.72-Glaciers-Glacial ice originates from the compaction of snow into firn and finally into ice under the weight of several successive annual accumulations. Refrozen melt water usually contributes to the increasing density of the glacial ice mass. With sufficient thickness, weight, and bulk, flow begins; all glaciers exhibit evidence of present or past motion in the form of moraines, crevasses, and other glacial geomorphic features. Where the snowline of adjacent ice-free areas extends across the glacier, it is known as the firn limit, which represents the dividing line between the glacier's two major zones, the zone of accumulation and the zone of ablation. While glaciers normally are recognized easily, certain glacial boundaries may be subject to misinterpretation, even by the experienced interpreter. Flow features up-glacier from the firn limit typically are obscured by fresh snow, forcing the image interpreter to depend on secondary information, such as valley shapes, or to seek a more discriminating sensor. Similarly, glacial drift materials (rock and soil) may stripe the surface of a glacier, and moraine material may cover the terminus (or snout) because of ablation, making boundary determination in that vicinity difficult. This later problem occasionally is compounded by the presence of considerable vegetation rooted in the insulating blanket of ablation moraine (Anderson etal., 1976). Cowardin et aI. (1979) define wetlands as lands where saturation with water is the dominant factor determining soil development and the types of plant and animal communities living in the soil and on its surface. The single feature that all wetlands share is soil or substrate that is at least periodically saturated with or covered by water. The upland limit for vegetated wetlands with soil is 1) the boundary between land with predominantly hydrophytic cover and land with predominantly mesophytic or xerophytic cover; 2) for nonvegetated wetlands with soil, the boundary between soil that is predominantly hydric and soil that is predominantly non hydric; or 3) in the case of wetlands without vegetation or soil, the boundary between land that is flooded or saturated sometime during the growing season each year and land that is not. Most wetlands are vegetated and are found on soil."}, {"section_title": "2.0-Wetland _", "text": "In the C-CAP Coastal Land-Cover Classification System (Table 2), \"Wetland\" includes all areas considered wetland by Cowardin et al. (1979) Cowardin et al. systems (i.e. Marine, Estuarine, Riverine, Lacustrine, Palustrine). Thus, C-CAP Level II wetland classes became 2.l-Marine/Estuarine Rocky Shore, 2.2-Marine/Estuarine Unconsolidated Shore, 2.3-Marine/Estuarine Emergent Wetland, 2.4-Estuarine Woody Wetland, 2.5-Riverine Unconsolidated Shore, 2.6-Lacustrine Unconsolidated Shore, 2.7-Palustrine Unconsolidated Shore, 2.8-Palustrine Emergent Wetland (persistent), and 2.9-Palustrine Woody Wetland. Salinity displays a horizontal gradient in marshes typical of coastal plain estuaries. This is evident not only through the direct measurement of salinity but also in the horizontal distribution of marsh plants in marshes with positive correlations between vertical rise and landward location (Daiber, 1986). Therefore Marine Estuarine Emergent Wetland was partitioned into Haline (Salt) and Mixohaline (Brackish) Marshes. For both subclasses, the definitions used in Cowardin et al. (1979) were used, i.e. the salinities for Mixohaline range from 0.5 to 30 ppt, and Haline include salinities >30 ppt. Within a marsh, plant zonation is usually quite evident. Along the Atlantic coast of North America the pioneer plant is saltmarsh cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, which often appears in pure stands. Higher up the slope saltmeadow hay, Spartina patens, becomes dominant, while the upland edge, are bordered by marsh elder, Iva frutescens, and groundsell tree, Baccharis halimifolia. Thus, salt marshes could be subdivided further into High Marsh and Low Marsh. C-CAP does not attempt to identify Nonpersistent Emergent Wetlands, because they are seasonal. These wetlands are classified as \"Riverine Water\" and \"Lacustrine Water.\" Marine and Estuarine Rocky Shores were combined into a single class, Marine/Estuarine Rocky Shore.

The break was made at 5 ppt salinity because it separates true seagrasses that require high salinity from low salinity species that are tolerant of or require fresh water. Both low and high salinity types of SRV are important to the C-CAP project. High Salinity includes Cowardin et al.'s mesohaline, polyhaline, euhaline, and hyperhaline salinity categories.

It describes the general appearance of the habitat in terms of either the dominant life form of the vegetation or the physiography and composition of the substrate-features that can be recognized without the aid of detailed environmental measurements. Vegetation is used at two different levels in the classification. Five life-forms-trees, shrubs, emergents, emergent mosses, and lichens-are used to define classes because they are relatively easy to distinguish, do not change distribution rapidly, and have traditionally been used as criteria for classification of wetlands. Other forms of vegetation, such as submersed or floating-leaved rooted vascular plants, free-floating vascular plants, submergent mosses, and algae, though frequently more difficult to detect, are used to define the class Aquatic Bed. Pioneer species that briefly invade wetlands when conditions are favorable are treated at the subclass level because they are transient and often are not true wetland species (Cowardin et aI., 1979). Using life-forms at the class level has two major advantages: 1) extensive biological knowledge is not required to distinguish between various life-forms and 2) various life-forms are easily recognizable on a great variety of remote sensing products (Anderson et aI., 1976) If vegetation (except pioneer species) covers :::-30% ofthe substrate, classes are distinguished on the basis of the life form of the plants that constitute the uppermost layer ofvegetation and that occupy an areal coverage :::-50% of vegetative cover. Finer differences in life-forms are recognized at the subclass level. For example, in the C-CAP system Estuarine Woody Wetland is divided into the subclasses Scrub-Shrub and Forest categories, each of which may be further characterized as Deciduous, Evergreen, and Mixed on the basis of the predominant life-form. This differs somewhat from the Cowardin et al. system which distinguishes trees from shrubs at the class level. If vegetation covers <30% of the substrate, the physiography and composition of the substrate are the principal characteristics used to distinguish classes. The nature of the substrate reflects regional and local variations in geology and the influence of wind, waves, and currents on erosion and deposition of substrate materials. The classes Bottoms, Shores, and Streambeds are separated on the basis of duration of inundation. In the Riverine, Lacustrine, and Palustrine Systems, Bottoms are submerged all or most of the time, whereas Streambeds and Shores are exposed all or most of the time. In the Marine and Estuarine Systems, Bottoms are Subtidal, whereas Streambeds and Shores are Intertidal. Bottoms, Shores, and Streambeds are further divided at the class level on the basis of the important characteristic of rock versus unconsolidated substrate. Subclasses are based on finer distinctions in substrate material unless, as with Streambeds and Shores, the substrate is covered by, or shaded by, an areal coverage of pioneering vascular plants (often non hydrophytes) :::-30%. The subclass is then simply \"vegetated.\" Further detail as to the type of vegetation must be obtained at the level of dominance type. Reefs are a unique class in which the substrate itself is composed primarily of living and dead animals. Subclasses of Reefs are designated on the basis of the type of organism that formed the reef. As shown in Appendix Table 2, the classes defined in Cowardin et al. (1979) include Rock Bottom (not used in the C-CAP system) Unconsolidated Bottom (not used in the C-CAP system) Aquatic Bed Reef Streambed (not used in the C-CAP system) Rocky Shore Unconsolidated Shore Emergent Wetland Scrub-Shrub Wetland Forested Wetland"}, {"section_title": "Aquatic Bed", "text": "Definition. The Aquatic Bed class includes wetlands and deepwater habitats dominated by plants that grow principally on or below the surface of the water for most of the growing season in most years. Water regimes include subtidal, irregularly exposed, regularly flooded, permanently flooded, intermittently exposed, semi-permanently flooded, and seasonally flooded. Description. Aquatic beds represent a diverse group of plant communities that require surface water for optimum growth and reproduction. They are best developed in relatively permanent water or under conditions of repeated flooding. The plants are either attached to the substrate or float freely in the water above the bottom or on the surface. The subclasses are Algal, Aquatic Moss (not used by C-CAP and not defined here), and Rooted Vascular. Algal-Algal beds are Widespread and diverse in the Marine and Estuarine Systems, where they occupy substrates characterized by a wide range of sediment depths and textures. They occur in both the Subtidal and Intertidal subsystems and may grow to depths of 30 m (98 ft). Coastal algal beds are most luxuriant along the rocky shores of the Northeast and West. Kelp (MaCTocystis) beds are especially well developed on the rocky substrates of the Pacific coast. Dominance types such as the rockweeds Fucus and Ascophyllum and the kelp Laminaria are common along both coasts. In tropical regions, green algae, including forms containing calcareous particles, are more characteristic; Halimeda and Penicllus are common examples. The red alga Laurenciaand the green algae Caulerpa, Enteromorpha, and Viva are also common Estuarine and Ma-rine dominance types; Enteromorpha and Ulva are tolerant of fresh water and flourish near the upper end of some estuaries. The stonewort Chara is also found in estuaries. Inland, the stoneworts Chara, Nitella, and Tolypella are examples of algae that look much like vascular plants and may grow in similar situations. However, meadows of Chara may be found in Lacustrine water as deep as 40 m (131 ft) where hydrostatic pressure limits the survival ofvascular submergents (phanaerogams). Other algae bearing less resemblance to vascular plants are also common. Mats of filamentous algae may cover the bottom in dense blankets, may rise to the surface under certain conditions, or may become stranded on unconsolidated or rocky shores. Rooted Vascular-Rooted Vascular beds include a large array of vascular species in the Marine and Estuarine Systems. They have been referred to as temperate grass flats (Phillips, 1974), tropical marine meadows, as well as eelgrass beds, turtlegrass beds, and seagrass beds. The greatest number of species occur in shallow, clear tropical, or subtropical waters of moderate current strength in the Caribbean and along the Florida and Gulf Coasts. Principal dominance types in these areas include turtle grass, Thalassia testudinum, shoalgrass, Halodule wrightii, manatee grass, Cymodocea filiformis, widgeon grass, Ruppia maritima, sea grasses, Halophila spp., and wild celery, Vallisneria americana."}, {"section_title": "Reef", "text": "Definition.

Although corals, oysters, and tube worms are the most visible organisms and are mainly responsible for reef formation, other mollusks, foraminifera, coralline algae, and other forms of life also contribute substantially to reef growth. Frequently, reefs contain far more dead skeletal material and shell fragments than living matter. The subclasses are Coral, Mollusk, and Worm. Only the first subclass is emphasized by C-CAP; the other two definitions are omitted. Coral-Coral reefs are widely distributed in shallow waters of warm seas, in Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and southern Florida.

Coral reefs lie almost entirely within the Subtidal subsystem of the Marine System, although the upper part of certain Reefs may be exposed.

In Marine and Estuarine Systems, Rocky Shores are generally high-energy habitats that lie exposed as a result of continuous erosion by wind-driven waves or strong currents. The substrate is stable enough to permit the attachment and growth of sessile or sedentary invertebrates as well as attached algae or lichens. Rocky shores usually display a vertical zonation that is a function of tidal range, wave action, and degree of exposure to the sun. In the Lacustrine and Riverine Systems, Rocky shores support sparse plant and animal communities. The subclasses are Bedrock and Rubble. More detailed definitions are provided in Cowardin et al. (1979). Unconsolidated Shore (Tidal Flats) Definition. The Unconsolidated Shore class includes all wetland habitats having three characteristics: 1) unconsolidated substrates with < 75% areal cover of stones, boulders, or bedrock; 2) <30% areal cover of vegetation other than pioneering plants; and 3) any of the following water regimes: irregularly exposed, regularly flooded, irregularly flooded, seasonally flooded, temporarily flooded, in termittently flooded, saturated, or artificially flooded. Intermittent or intertidal channels of the Riverine System and intertidal channels of the Estuarine System are classified as Streambed. Description. Unconsolidated Shores are characterized by substrates lacking vegetation except for pioneering plants that become established during brief periods when growing conditions are favorable. Erosion and deposition by waves and currents produce a number oflandforms such as beaches, bars, and flats, all of which are included in this class. Unconsolidated Shores may be found adjacent to Unconsolidated Bottoms in all systems. As in the class Unconsolidated Bottoms, the particle size of the substrate and the water regime are the important factors determining the types of plant and animal communities present. Different substrates usually support characteristic invertebrate fauna. The subclasses are Cobble-gravel, Sand, and Mud. More detailed definitions are provided in Cowardin et al. (1979)."}, {"section_title": "Emergent Wetland", "text": "Definition. The Emergent Wetland class is characterized by erect, rooted, herbaceous hydrophytes (excluding mosses and lichens) which are present for most of the growing season in most years. These wetlands are usually dominated by perennial plants. All water regimes are included except subtidal and irregularly exposed. Description. In areas with relatively stable climatic conditions, emergent wetlands maintain the same appearance year after year. In other areas, such as the prairies of the central United States, violent climatic fluctuations cause them to revert to open water in some years. Emergent wetlands are found throughout the United States and occur in all systems except Marine. Emergent wetlands are known by many names, including marsh, meadow, fen, prairie pothole, and slough. Areas dominated by pioneer plants that become established during periods of low water are not emergent wetlands and should be classified as Vegetated Unconsolidated Shores or Vegetated Streambeds. The subclasses in the Cowardin et al. system are Persistent and Nonpersistent."}, {"section_title": "Woody Wetland", "text": "The Woody Wetland class includes any species with an aerial stem that persists for more than one season. The Woody Wetland class is divided into three subclasses: Deciduous, Evergreen, and Mixed. Deciduous-The Deciduous Woody Wetland subclass includes all wetland forest and shrub areas having a predominance of trees and shrubs that lose their leaves or needles at the end of the frost-free season or at the beginning of a dry season. This category contains greater than two-thirds deciduous trees and shrubs. The Deciduous Woody Wetland category can be divided into three categories: Forest, Scrub-Shrub, and Dead. Forest-Definition. Forested wetland is characterized by woody vegetation~6 m in height. All water regimes are included except subtidal. Description. Forested wetlands are most common in the eastern United States and in those sections of the West where moisture is relatively abundant, particularly along rivers and in mountains. They occur only in the Palustrine and Estuarine Systems and normally contain an overstory of trees, an understory of young trees or shrubs, and a herbaceous layer. Forested wetlands in the Estuarine System, including the mangrove forests of Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, are known by such names as swamps, hammocks, heads, and bottoms. These names often occur in combination with species names or plant associations, such as cedar swamp or bottom land hardwoods. Broad-leaved Deciduous-Dominant trees typical of broadleaved deciduous wetlands, which are represented throughout the United States, are most common in the South and East. Common dominants are species such as red maple, American elm, Ulmus americana, the ashes Fraxinus pennsylvanica and F. nigra, black gum, Nyssa sylvatica, tupelo gum, N. aquatica, swamp white oak, Quercus bicolor, overcup oak, Q. lyrata, and basket oak, Q. michauxii. These wetlands generally occur on mineral soils or highly decomposed organic soils. Needle-leaved Deciduous-The southern representative of the Needle-leaved Deciduous Wetland subclass is bald cypress, Taxodium distichum, which is noted for its ability to tolerate long periods of surface inundation. Tamarack is characteristic of the boreal forest region, where it occurs as a dominant on organic soils. Relatively few other species are included in this subclass. Scrub-Shrub-Definition. Scrub-Shrub wetland includes areas dominated by woody vegetation <6 m (20 ft) tall. The species include true shrubs, young trees, and trees or shrubs that are small or stunted because of environmental conditions. All water regimes except subtidal are included. Description. Scrub-shrub wetlands may represent a successional stage leading to forested wetlands, or they may be relatively stable communities. They occur only in the Estuarine and Palustrine Systems but are one of the most widespread classes in the United States. Scrub-shrub wetlands are known by many names, such as shrub swamp, shrub, bog, and pocosin. The C-CAP category includes forests composed of young trees <6 m tall regardless of potential height at maturity. Broad-leaved Deciduous-In Estuarine System wetlands the predominant deciduous and broad-leaved trees or shrubs are plants such as sea-myrtle, Baccharis halimifolia, and marsh elder, Iva frutescens. In the Palustrine System typical dominance types are alders, Alnus spp., willows, Salix spp., buttonbush, Cephalanthus cocidentalis, red osier dogwood, Comus stolonifera, honeycup, Zenobia pulverulenta, spirea, Spiraea douglasii, bog birch, Betula pumila, and young trees of species such as red maple, Acerrubrum, or black spruce, Picea mariana. Needle-leaved Deciduous-This group, consisting of wetlands where trees or shrubs are predominantly deciduous and needle-leaved, is represented by young or stunted trees such as tamarack or bald cypress, Taxodium distichum. Dead-Definition. Dominated by dead deciduous woody vegetation, these wetlands are usually produced by a prolonged rise in the water table resulting from impoundment of water by landslides, human activity, or beaver activity. Such wetlands may also result from various other factors such as fire, salt spray, insect infestation, air pollution, and herbicides. Evergreen-The Evergreen Woody Wetland subclass contains wetland forests and shrubs that do not lose their leaves or needles at the end of a frost-free season or at the beginning of a dry season. The Evergreen Woody Wetland category is subdivided into two additional categories: Forest and Scrub--Shrub. Forest-Definition. Forested wetland is characterized by woody vegetation~6 m in height. All water regimes are included except subtidal. Broad-leaved Evergreen-In the Southeast, broad-leaved evergreen wetlands reach their greatest development. Red bay, Persea borbonia, loblolly bay, Gordonia lasianthus, and sweet bay, Magnolia virginiana, are prevalent, especially on organic soils. This group also includes red mangrove, black mangrove, Avicenniagerminans, and white mangrove, Languncularia racemosa, which are adapted to varying levels of salinity. Needle-leaved Evergreen-Black spruce, growing on organic soils, represents a major dominant of the Needle-leaved Evergreen subclass in the north. Though black spruce is common on nutrient-poor soils, northern white cedar, Thuja occidentalis, dominates northern wetlands on more nutrientrich sites. Along the Atlantic Coast, Atlantic white cedar, Chamaecyparis thyoides, is one of the most common dominants on organic soils. Pond pine, Pinus serotina, is a common needle-leaved evergreen found in the Southeast in association with dense stands of broad-leaved evergreen and deciduous shrubs. Scrub-Shrub-Definition. Scrub-shrub wetland includes areas dominated by woody vegetation <6 m (20 ft) tall. The species include true shrubs, young trees, and trees or shrubs that are small or stunted because of environmental conditions. All water regimes except subtidal are included. Broad-leaved Evergreen-In the Estuarine System, vast wetland areas are dominated by mangroves (Rhizophora mangle, Languncularia racemosa, Conocarpus erectus, and Avicennia germinans) that are I m to <6 m tall. In the Palustrine System, the broad-leaved evergreen species are typically found on organic soils. Northern representatives are labrador tea, Ledum groenlandicum, bog rosemary, Andromedaglaucophylla, bog laurel, Kalmia polifolia, and the semi-evergreen leatherleaf, Chamaedaphne calyculata. In the south, fetterbush, Lyonia lucida, coastal sweetbells, Leucothoe axillaris, inkberry, flex glabra, and the semi-evergreen black ti-ti, Cyrilla racemiflora, are characteristic broad-leaved evergreen species. Needle-leaved Evergreen-The dominant species in needleleaved evergreen wetlands are young or stunted trees such as black spruce or pond pine. Dead-Definition. These wetland areas are dominated by dead evergreen woody vegetation. Like dead deciduous woody wetlands, they are most common in, or around the edges of, impoundments and beaver ponds. The same factors that produce dead deciduous woody wetlands produce dead evergreen woody wetlands. Mixed-The Mixed Woody Wetland subclass includes all forest and shrub wetland areas where both evergreen and deciduous trees and shrubs grow and neither predominates. When evergreen and deciduous species each occupy :::0:33% of an area, the land is classified as Mixed Woody. The Mixed Woody category is subdivided into two additional categories: Forest and Scrub/Shrub. Forest-This category includes all forested areas where both evergreen and deciduous trees are growing and neither predominate. Scrub/Shrub-This category includes all shrub areas where both evergreen and deciduous shrubs are growing and neither predominate. Dead-Wetland areas dominated by dead mixed woody vegetation are, like dead deciduous woody wetlands, most common in, or around the edges of, impoundments and beaver ponds. The same factors that produce dead deciduous woody wetlands produce dead mixed woody wetlands. Water Cowardin et al. (1979) define deepwater habitats as permanently flooded lands lying below the deepwater boundary of wetlands. Deepwater habitats include environments where surface water is permanent and often deep, so that water, rather than air, is the principal medium within which the dominant organisms live, whether or not they are attached to the substrate. As in wetlands, the dominant plants are hydrophytes. However, the substrates are considered nonsoil because the water is too deep to support emergent vegetation. The class Water includes Marine/Estuarine, Lacustrine, Palustrine, and Riverine Deepwater subclasses as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979)."}]
