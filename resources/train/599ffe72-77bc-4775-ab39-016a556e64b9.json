At kindergarten entry, the average cognitive scores of children from families with the lowest socioeconomic status are 60% lower than the average scores of those from families with the highest socioeconomic status (Lee & Burkam, 2002) . This socioeconomic gap in development is evident early. The effects of poverty on children's development appear at about age 2 and are pronounced by age 3 (Brooks-Gunn & Duncan, 1997; Duncan & Brooks-Gunn, 2000) . The early developmental gaps associated with poverty persist even into high school (Duncan, Yeung, Brooks-Gunn, & Smith, 1998) . Moreover, the adverse effects of poverty are often more extreme when poverty is experienced during earlier compared to later childhood periods (Duncan et al., 1998; Vorruba-Drzal, 2006) .\nIn addition, children from low-income families are more likely to have developmental risks and disabilities that limit their school readiness than those from middle-income families (BrooksGunn & Duncan, 1997; Fujiura & Yamaki, 2000; Scarborough, Spiker, Mallik, & Hebbeler, 2004) . This finding was evident in the sample of children living in poverty who participated in the Early Head Start Research and Evaluation (EHSRE) project. These children were more than twice as likely to receive Part C early intervention services before age 3 (4.7%; Peterson et al. , 2004) than those in the general U .S. population in 2000"}, {"section_title": "436", "text": "(1.8%; National Early Childhood Technical Assistance Center, 2007); many more chi ldren were identified as having developmental risks that likely would have made them eligible for Part C services though they were not enrolled (Peterson et al., 2004) .\nPrevious research regarding the development of children with developmental risks or disabilities generally has been restricted to studies of children with single conditions. Recent studies of developmental status for children with disabilities have focused on children with specific conditions, such as Down syndrome (Carr, 2005) , traumatic brain injury (Hammond, Hart, Bushnik, Corrigan, & Sasser, 2004) , low birth weight (Dieterich, Hebert, Landry, Swank, & Smith, 2004) , or neuromuscular disease (Lomax-Bream et al., 2007) . Although studies of children with specific diagnosed conditions are important, children in poverty are at greater risk for experiencing general develop men tal delays , as well as a variety of health-related conditions. Relatively little, however, is known about the school readiness of children whose development may be compromised not only by poverty but also by developmental disabilities or biological risks. The purposes of the current study are twofold:\nTo compare school readiness at kindergarten entry of low-income children who were identified as having suspected developmental delays or biological risks before age 3 but received no Parr C intervention with the readiness of children who received Part C services and those who had no disability.\nTo examine the contribution of Part C and Part B interventions to chi ldren's school readiness."}, {"section_title": "PART C AND B SERVICES", "text": "The Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) mandates Part C programs for infants and toddlers and Part B programs for preschoolers. Parr C programs are designed to serve families of children with established developmental delays and those at risk for developmental delays . IDEA allows each state to set eligibility criteria; as a result, states vary in determining how children will qualify for Part C services. Moreover, many low-income children may have developmental delays or other developmental risks yet do not receive Part C services because they are never identified or because their parents choose not to receive those services (Peterson et al. , 2004) . Few researchers have examined developmen tal outcomes of children who received Part C services (Carlson et al., 2008) . Thus, little is known regarding comparisons of school readiness among children who did and did not receive Parr C services.\nMany educators have emphasized the importance of early intervention for children with developmental risks and disabilities. In the National Pre-Elemen tary Education Longitudinal Study (PEELS), children who received Part B early childhood special ed ucation services were followed until they entered elementary school, where a significant improvement in their literacy and cognitive standardized scores were noted among children with developmental delays, learning disabilities, or speech/ language impairments (Carlson et al., 2008) . The PEELS study, however, did not compare the outcomes of children served to those who did not receive Part C or Part B services. Comparing the school readiness of children who received Part C or Part B services to that of children who were identified as having disability indicators before age 3 but who did not receive Part C or Part B intervention services could prove helpful in the design and delivery of early intervention and early childhood special education services for low-income children."}, {"section_title": "CHIL.DREN WITH", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "DEVELOPMENTAL.

In rhe PEELS, 26% of children receiving Part B services were identified as having a developmental delay (Carl- , 2008) . Some children with developmental delays may not be referred for Part C services. In addition, assessment measures for infants and toddlers may not be sensitive enough to detect developmental delays, and eligibility criteria for Part B and Part C are different. Scarborough et al. found that most children identified as eligible for services due to having a developmental delay received Part C services later than those in any other eligibility categories.\nChildren with developmental delays present great variability in their initial evaluation results across developmental domains, as well as in later developmental outcomes (Aylward, 2002) . Only two studies, however, have examined the kindergarten readiness of children whose developmental delays were identified early in life (Carlson er al., 2008; Shevell, Majnemer, Platt, Webster, & Birnbaum, 2005) . The PEELS followed children who received Part B (preschool special education) services.

The children's EHS program status was not related directly to research questions in the current study nor to the children's disability indicators or school readiness scores. Thus, children from both the EHS and control groups were combined in the current analyses.\nChildren were divided into five disability categories based on indicators that reflected conceptualization of disability and developmental risk outlined in IDEA and that were collected for the EHSRE study through parents' and EHS staff members' reports and direct child assessment information before age 3 (Peterson et al., 2004) . Children who received Part C services were identified based on reports by their parents and EHS program staff Children were identified as having a \"suspected developmental delay\" based on low scores on direct child assessments (e.g., Bayley MDI score < 1.5 SD below the mean) or parent reports that a health professional had reported suspected developmental delay. Children were categorized as having a biological risk if their parents reported they had one or more chronic health conditions that have a, fairly low association with developmental problems (e.g., diabetes, anemia, congenital heart disease). The five disability categories were mutually exclusive for the purposes of this current study. The numbers of children in each category follow: (a) children who received Part C services (n = 129) , (b) children identified as having a suspected developmental delay only (n = 287), (c) children identified as having a biological risk only (n = 741), (d) children identified as having both a suspected developmental delay and a biological risk (n = 395),"}, {"section_title": "Exceptional Children", "text": "and (e) children who did not have any identified disability indicator by age 3 (n = 631).\n\nThe current study found that chi ldren who had a biological risk scored as high on school readiness skills as those who had no identified disability indicator. This finding is not consistent with findings of other studies reviewed by Steen and Campbell (2008) . Steen and Campbell found that studies of children with diarrhea, diabetes, very low birth weight, lead poisoning, sleep disorders, and mal11utrition revealed lower cognitive abilities and a higher risk of school fai lure in these specific populations than in children without biological ris~s. The reason that the current study did not find such a difference in school readiness scores may relate to the characteristics of the St fllple: (a) All children in this study were living in poverty; (b) children who were identified as having a suspected developmental delay and a biological risk before age 3 were excluded from the category of children with biological risks; (c) the specific types of identified biological risks may have differed between the two swdies.\nAbout 40% of children identified as having only a biological risk before age 3 had no identifted disability indicator at kindergarten entry (Peterson et al. , in press ). More than 29o/o of children who were identified as having a suspected developmental delay and a biological risk before age 3, however, received Part B services (Peterson et a!., in press ). These children had lower preacademic school readiness skills than did those who had on ly a biological risk or no disability indicator. Because this study could not answer whether certain biological risks were associated with lower preacademic school readiness skills, further longiwdinal investigation is needed to understand the school readiness of children with a variety of biological risks . Several studies have found that school performance scores of children with a biological risk, in comparison to their counterparts in good health, decrease as they get older (Steen & Campbell, 2008 ).\nIn the current study, overall , children who received Part B services had poor school readiness skills across all developmenta l domains (preacademic skills and cognitive social and emotion regulation skills) at kindergarten entry as compared to those who did not receive Part B services. This suggests that Part B services were provided to children who indeed needed such services. It will be necessary to follow these children to examine their later school performance.\nMore than 30% of children who participated in the current study were identified as having a developmenral delay before age 3 . It might be that because their developmental status was assessed directly at several points between birth and age 3 as parr of the EHSRE study, their developmental delays were more likely to be identified. Rosenberg et a!. (2008) amibuted the finding that children with a developmental delay comprised up to 13% of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study sample to the fact that they used direct child assessments instead of parent reports. The difference in percentages of children with a developmental delay between these two samples could be explained by the fact that the current sample was drawn from a low-income population. The prevalence of children with a developmental delay is higher in low-income populations (5.0%) than in middle-class or general populations (3.8%; Brooks-Gunn & Duncan, 1997) . The effects of poverty on children's development generally start to appear between ages 2 and 5 (Brooks-Gunn, 2003; Brooks-Gunn & Duncan, 1997; Duncan & Brooks-Gunn, 2000) .\nIn this study, children's social-emotional skills at kindergarten entry did not differ by disability indicator group as established before age 3. There is a lack of research examining social-emotional skills of children who have disability indicators, so our study represents a novel finding. T he study m eas u res used to capture chi ldren's socialemotional skills, however, were based on parent report or examiner rating completed after child direct assessments. Further investigation is necessary to confirm our findings using different measures of social-emotional-skills, such as direct observation or teacher's report."}, {"section_title": "MEASURES", "text": "Trained examiners directly assessed children's preacademic skills and approaches toward learning.

Cronbach's alpha coefficient of PPVT-III for the EHSRE Longitudinal Follow-Up study sample was .96 (Love eta!., 2011) .\nStory and Print Concepts. The Story and Print Concepts task is designed to measure children's knowledge about how print works and their story comprehension. The measure was adapted for the Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey (FACES) from the original assessment developed by Mason and Stewart (1989) . The examiner asks the child questions while showing a story book, Goodnight Moon (Brown, 1947) . This scale consists of a total of 9 items. The first 8 items are scored yes (1) or no (0); for example, \"Show me the front of the book.\" The last item is rated from 0 to 3 based on the number of things that the child answers to a question, \"Can you tell me some other things we said 'goodnight' to?\" The highest possible score is 11 .

The ratings were completed based on behavioral observations of the child throughout the entire child assessment in the current study. Observers used the 4-point Leiter-R Examiner Rating Scale to rate children's attention, organization and impulse control, activity level, sociability, energy and feelings, anxiety, and sensory reactivity. In the EHSRE Longitudinal Follow-Up study, rwo com-440 posites scores were calculated: Cognitive Social and Emotional Regulation. The Cognitive Social composite score refers to a constellation of motivational, interpersonal, and test-performance skills related to school success. The Emotional Regulation composite score refers to effective emotional self-regulatory aspects of performance in challenging tasks, which are prerequisites for academic success (Love et al., 2011) . Standardized scores were calculated for these two composite scores. Cronbach's alpha coefficients of the Cognitive Social and Emotional Regulation composite were .93 and .96, respectively (Love et al., 2011) .\nSocial Skills and Positive Approaches to Learning (SSPAL) . Parents rated children's SSPAL using the modified Social Skills Rating System (SSRS; Gresham & Elliott, 1990 ) and the Entwisle Scale of Personal Maturity (Entwisle, Alexander, Pallas, & Cadigan, 1987) to capture children's positive social interaction skills, as well as their behavioral dispositions toward learning (Love et al. , 2011) . The SSPAL scale consists of 7 items rated on a 3-point Likert scale (0 = not true, 1 = somewhat/sometimes true, and 2 = very true/often true). Summative sco res were calculated, with higher scores indicating more positive social skills and approaches to learning. The highest possible score was 14.

The Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach & Rescorla, 2000) is a 99-item behavioral checklist, used to measure the behavioral, emotional, and social functioning of children from 11/2 to 5 years old. Parents rate their children's behaviors using a 3-point scale (O = not true, 1 = somewhat/sometimes true, and 2 = very true/often true) . The EHSRE Longitudinal Follow-Up study team selected 19 items of the Aggressive Behavior subscale to capture the children's aggressive behavior (Love et al., 20 11 ).

Maternal education and depression symptoms and home environment were also examined in the current data analyses.\nCaregiver Depression. The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-0; Radloff, 1977 ) is a 20-item, self-administered measure of cognitive, affective, and behavioral depressive symptoms. In the EHSRE Longitudinal Follow-Up, 12 items were selected from the original scale to assess parent's depressive symptoms. Summative scores (ranging from 0 to 36) were calculated with higher scores indicating more depressive symptoms. Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the CES-0 scores was .88 in the EHSRE Longitudinal Follow-Up study (Love et al., 2011) .\nQuality of Home Environment. The Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment Inventory (HOME; Caldwell & Bradley, 2003) was used to assess the warmth in the child's home, as well as the stimulating quality of the home learning environment. A modified version consisting of 20 items of the original 72 was used to assess the quality of the home environment of young children through observation and direct parent interview in the current study. Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the original HOME measure was .84 ranging from .49 to .78 for different subscales. One of the HOME authors, however, argues that traditional psychometric properties are not helpful for indicators measuring all aspects of home environments influencing child well-being (Bradley, 2004) , and the psychometric properties were nor reported for the EHSRE Longitudinal Follow-Up study (Love et al., 2011) .

European American children were more likely to receive Part C services and less likely to be identified as having a developmental delay than were children of any other ethnicity. Children whose home language was English were more likely to be identified as receiving Part C services and having biological risks than those whose home language was not, whereas these same children were slightly less likely to be identified as having a developmental delay. Children who were enrolled in Head Start programs were more likely to be identified as having any disability indicator than those who were not. Children who were enrolled in formal care settings were more likely to receive Part C services, to be identified as having a biological risk, and less likely to be identified as having any other disability indicator compared to those who were not enrolled in formal care.\nMothers of children with both a suspected developmental delay, alone or in combination with a biological risk, had fewer years of education than those with children who received Part C services, children who had only a biological risk, or children who had none of the identified indi- cators. Mochers of children who had any disabiliry indicator had higher scores on the depressive symptoms scale than those of children with no identified disabiliry indicator. Correlational analyses indicated that all these child and family demographic characteristics were also associated with children's school readiness scores. Based on results of these preliminary analyses, the following variables were selected for GLM analyses: research site, child gender, minority status, home language, Head Start and center-based child care program enrollment status, mother's symptoms of depression, mother's education, family income, and home environment. In addition, child age was added in further analyses because it was related to children's unstandardized school readiness scores (e .g., Story and Print Concepts, SSPAL, Aggressive Behavior scores) . The EHS status was also included in the GLM analyses because the current study was embedded in the EHSRE randomized experimental design study. To simplify further analysis, the ethniciry variable was recoded into \"minority\" or \"not minority\" status, and public assistance variables were excluded because of their close association and overlap with family mcome. GLM analyses were conducted to estimate children's school readiness using the disability indicator groups established before age 3 and receipt of Part B services. Research site, child gender, minoriry status, home language, EHS participation, Head Start and center-based child care program enrollment status, parent's education, family income, and home environment were all controlled in these analyses to examine differences in the estimated means on school readiness measures across the disabiliry indicator groups.

Further, the Book Comprehension scores of children who had received Part C services were higher than those of children who had a suspected developmental delay. The PPVT-III mean scores, however, for children identified, before age 3, as having a suspected developmental delay, either alone or in combination with a biological risk, were significantly lower than those of children with only a biological risk or no identified disabiliry indicator.

The five groups included the following: children who had received +p < .10. *p < .05. **p < .01. ***p < .001. Part C services, had a suspected developmental delay, had a biological risk, had both a suspected developmental delay and a biological risk, or did not have any identified disability indicator. This study estimated school readiness for low-i nco me children in each of these groups, as well as by their receipt of Part B serv ices during the preschool period. This study found no statistically significant differences in the school readiness ski lls between children receiving Part C services and children from any disability indicator groups, including those without disability indicators. This is especially notable because children who received Part C services may have had more serious delays than those who had a suspected developmental delay and may have had a larger gap to overcome. Few studies have examined the developmental status or school readiness of low-income children who received Part C services compared to those of children who did not receive Part C services . The only positive family outcomes of Part C services were recently found in the NEILS (Bailey et al., 2005) . Generally, measuring effects of early intervention for children with disabilities is complex and challenging because children have different 446 disability conditions and varying levels of severity; as well , chi ldren receive different types and amounts of serv ices (Bai ley, Aytch, Odo m , Symons, & Wolery, 1999). Considering rhat the intensity of Part C services seems relatively low and considerable variation exists among states in terms of coverage, eligibility criteria, and service delivery models (Bai ley et al. , 1999) , this finding suggests that children who had a developmental delay received Part C services appropriate to address their developmental need areas and close gaps in school readiness relative to children who did not have a disability indicator.\nAt kindergarten entry, the language and cognitive scores of children who had a suspected developmental delay before age 3 were lower than those of children who had a biological risk or had no identified disability indicator. This is consistent with the results of an earlier study in which preschool children with a suspected developmental delay were fo und to have consistently low (more than 1. 5 SD below the mean on the Battelle Development Inventory and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale) developmental outcome scores at 6 and 7 years of age (Sheve ll et al., 2005) . Unlike Shevell et al., who fo llowed only preschool children with a suspected developmental delay, the current study provided evidence that low-income children identified as having a suspected developmental delay early in life are more likely to have poor language and cognitive skills at school entry than are those without an identified disability indicator or those with only a biological risk. T he scores of these children on standardized measures ~f preacademic skills, however, were still in the no rmal range.\nFurther, the current study examined rhe school readiness status of low-income children who were identified as having a suspected developmental delay but did not receive any Part C early intervention services, compared to those who did receive Part C services. The children in the current study, with a suspected developmental delay, had lower estimated mean scores than those who received Part C services after controlling for child and fami ly characteristics and their program experiences; the differences between these two groups, however, in language and cognitive school readiness skills at kindergarten entry were not statistically significant. It is worrisome that children with a suspected developmental delay had lower school readiness skills than those who had no identified disability indicator, whereas there was lit tle d ifference between the scores of chi ldren who received Part C services and those who did not have any identified disability indicator. Children with suspected developmental delays may benefit more from early intervention than child ren with other specific disabi lity indicators. A large proportion of this sample of children was reported as having a suspected developmental delay but did not receive Part C services (Peterson et a!., 2004) . Rosenberg, Zhang, and Robinson (2008) found that only 1 Oo/o of children who were iden tified as having a developmental delay at 9 months had received Part C services by 24 mo nths of age. In a Canadian sample, 23% of 3-yea\u00b7 r-old child ren who had a suspected developmental delay did not receive any services over a 1-year period (Majnemer, Shevell, Rosenbaum, & Abrahamowicz, 2002) . As well , an empirical study showed that children who were identified as having a developmental delay and who received preschool special education services made significant gains in preacademic, language, and social skills (Carlson et al., 2008) ."}, {"section_title": "LIMITATIONS", "text": "The current research was cond uct ed using EHSRE data. The purpose of the EHSRE study was to evaluate the long-term effects of EHS and other program experiences that children had from their birth to age 3 (Love eta!., 2011), not to examine the disability indicator status of children or the effectiveness of Parr C early intervention pro-448 grams. Therefore, the current study is a correlational study, and the causal relationships between children's receipt of Part C and B services and their school readiness should be interpreted cautiously. This study sample was drawn from a lowincome population eligib le for EHS. The proportion of EHSRE participating children who were identified as having a developmental delay was higher than a nationally representative sample of children who had developmental delays (Scarborough et a!., 2004) . The findings from our study cannot be generalized to children from families of varied income levels. Moreover, in our study, children were identified as having a disability indicator based on parent and teacher reports and direct child assessments, including children identified as receiving Parr C and B services. These categories are more inclusive than the eligibility criteria used by the states to identify children for these services. Thus, it is possible that children in this study were more likely to be identified as having a disability indicator than children who would be identified as eligible for Part C and B services."}, {"section_title": "Future studies should follow the school performances and adjustments for children identified as having developmental risks in their early years throughout their years in school.", "text": "The analyses in the current study did not include children's early developmental status in our prediction models because of strong stability between children's cognitive performance at ages 3 and 5. Further, children's development is not linear and can be affected by multiple factors. Future research designed to capture longitudinal trajectory patterns in developmental status and school readiness for children identified as having a developmental risk and who received Part C and B services is recommended. Future studies should follow the school performances and adjustments for children identified as having developmental risks in their early years throughout their years in school."}, {"section_title": "Summer2011", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "RECOMMENDATIONS", "text": "These findings suggest that further studies of the developmental trajectories of children with a developmental delay who receive early intervention and early childhood special education services compared to those who do not are warranted. Longitudinal studies may provide evidence of the importance of identifying developmental delays early and tailoring programs to meet the needs of the children and their families. Further studies examining other predictors of developmental status and school readiness for children with developmental delays are necessary as well. In addition, understanding the characteristics of children who have a developmental delay and do not receive early intervention and early childhood special education services and the reasons that they do not receive these services would be helpful to improve the effective use of service systems to reach children with developmental delays and develop appropriate intervention for these children and families.\nPolicymakers and professionals in early intervention and early childhood special education need to focus special attention on the possibility of developmental delays among low-income children to provide appropriate services for children who do present a developmental delay. Effective strategies for screening and identifying children at risk for developmental delays may help to deliver appropriate services to these children at an early age.\nT he findin gs reported here are based on research conducted as part of the nati onal Early H ead Start Research and Evaluation Project funded by th e Admini stratio n fo r C hil dren and Fam ili es 702.855.5414"}]
