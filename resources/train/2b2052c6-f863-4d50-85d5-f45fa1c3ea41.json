[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "ABSTRACT Background Development of new therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasingly focused on more mildly affected populations, and requires new assessment and outcome strategies. Patients in early stages of AD have mild cognitive decline and no, or limited, functional impairment. To respond to these assessment challenges, we developed a measurement approach based on established scale items that exhibited change in previous amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) trials. Methods Partial least squares regression with a longitudinal clinical decline model identified items from commonly used clinical scales with the highest combined sensitivity to change over time in aMCI and weighted these items according to their relative contribution to detecting clinical progression in patients' early stages of AD. The resultant AD Composite Score (ADCOMS) was assessed for its ability to detect treatment effect in aMCI/prodromal AD ( pAD) clinical trial populations. Results ADCOMS consists of 4 Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale items, 2 MiniMental State Examination items, and all 6 Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes items. ADCOMS demonstrated improved sensitivity to clinical decline over individual scales in pAD, aMCI and in mild AD dementia. ADCOMS also detected treatment effects associated with the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in these populations. Improved sensitivity predicts smaller sample size requirements when ADCOMS is used in early AD trials. Conclusions ADCOMS is proposed as new standard outcome for pAD and mild AD dementia trials, and is progressing in a CAMD-sponsored qualification process for use in registration trials of pAD."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) precedes the development of symptoms by many years. 1 This insight has led to a shift in AD research and treatment development to earlier predementia stages of AD, traditionally defined as amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and, more recently, further specified as 'MCI due to AD', or 'prodromal AD' ( pAD) (as defined by the International Working Group). 2 3 The earliest clinical manifestations of AD involve very mild decline in cognition with measurable functional impairment developing later in the disease progression. These subtle changes early in the predementia stage of AD are difficult to measure, and new approaches are required to detect change and establish treatment effects. Currently, there is no consensus on standard endpoints for use in aMCI populations. 4 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has indicated that a single composite outcome may be appropriate for pAD/MCI due to AD trials. 5 Cognitive instruments, such as the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scalecognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and neuropsychological test items show relatively little change over time in pAD/aMCI participants, primarily due to ceiling effects in many of the items that make up these scales. 6 7 Scales that measure functional or global changes may be unable to capture subtle clinical decline due to the comparatively mild functional deficits in pAD/aMCI patients. [8] [9] [10] While clinical tools that are widely used in AD dementia trials may lack overall sensitivity, certain items within these scales appear to be more responsive to clinical decline in aMCI/pAD. We sought to develop an AD Composite Score (ADCOMS) comprised of items from existing scales that, when combined, would be sensitive to AD-specific clinical decline in aMCI/ pAD. After identifying the items, we assessed the ability of ADCOMS to detect treatment effects in data sets from previously conducted trials of cholinesterase inhibitors with proven efficacy in AD.

These data sets included the aMCI subgroup from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1; ADNI-MCI, n=405; downloaded on 20 May 2010), the placebo group from the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) 'A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vitamin E and donepezil HCL (Aricept) to delay clinical progression from MCI to AD' (ADCS-MCI, n=264), 8 the placebo group of 'A 1 year, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of the efficacy and safety of donepezil hydrochloride in patients with MCI' (MCI-412, n=388), 9 and the placebo group from 'Hippocampus study: comparative effect of donepezil 10 mg/day and placebo on clinical and radiological markers' (MCI-415, n=103) 12 studies. Demographic and baseline characteristics of these data sets are summarised in table 1. The pooled data set from these four trials is referred to as pooled-MCI (n=1160).\nTwo enriched populations were defined within the pooled-MCI group: cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b21-42 positive (equivalent to MCI due to AD with intermediate likelihood and almost equivalent to pAD, with exception that pAD criteria high CSF total tau or phosphorylated tau along with low CSF A\u03b21-42 levels; this population is referred to as either MCI due to AD or pAD) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) \u03b54 carrier aMCI. 2 CSF biomarkers were available only for aMCI participants in ADNI-1, of whom 146 were CSF A\u03b21-42 positive (A\u03b21-42\u2264192 pg/mL).

Clinical trials for pAD are being initiated, and improved outcomes for these new types of trials are needed. Traditional outcome scales and analytic approaches used in AD studies are less than optimal for measuring clinical progression in pAD/aMCI. 15 ADCOMS is an outcome approach optimised to detect AD-related clinical decline in pAD/aMCI due to AD. It was derived by employing a statistical model to select the most sensitive weighted combination of items from commonly used clinical scales in a large, diverse clinical data set including aMCI/pAD populations. The derivation of ADCOMS used robust mathematical approaches to ensure its objectivity. PLS is a method for modelling the relationship between one or more responses and several correlated independent variables. It combines a regression approach, optimising sensitivity to decline, with a technique similar to a principal components analysis which identifies item changes that converge on a unified disease construct thereby optimising specificity to AD.\nADCOMS is based on the assumption that despite the inherent heterogeneity in this slowly progressing neurodegenerative disease, a population that is sufficiently well defined to represent the early stages of AD will follow a similar declining path. When applied to a large aMCI population, our PLS model identified key items characteristic of the declining trajectory for pAD/aMCI.\nADCOMS demonstrates improved sensitivity to clinical decline relative to traditional AD scales used alone. Sensitivity to clinical decline in AD, as measured by ADCOMS, was not further improved by adding items from other scales including ADL, FAQ, NPI and standard neuropsychological tests (data not shown). While executive function is known to decline early in aMCI, none of the corresponding neuropsychological tests included in our analyses were selected by the PLS regression procedure. CDR items may better address executive function indirectly via evaluation of changes in global/functional performance. ADCOMS was shown to be more sensitive than individual scales to AD-specific clinical decline in an enriched aMCI population defined by APOE \u03b54 carrier status (MSDR=0.56) and pAD defined as aMCI with reduced CSF A\u03b21-42 levels (MSDR=0.81). This supports the objective of developing ADCOMS for use in pAD clinical trials with disease-modifying agents. ADCOMS maintained its sensitivity in very mild AD dementia and can be applied in mixed pAD/mild AD dementia trials including pAD patients who progress to mild AD dementia over the treatment period in trials. ADCOMS' improved sensitivity to clinical decline has the benefit of reducing sample size requirements for pAD trials. Clinical assessment of a diseasemodifying agent targeting a 25% slowing of clinical progression in pAD patients with 80% power and two-sided 0.5 \u03b1 would require 400 patients per arm with ADCOMS, 2507 per arm with ADAS-cog, and 494 per arm with CDR-SB.\nA suitable clinical outcome for clinical trials in pAD/aMCI must be sensitive to both clinical decline and treatment effect. ADCOMS demonstrated the largest sensitivity to treatment effects associated with donepezil in the ADCS-MCI trial compared with ADAS-cog, MMSE and CDR-SB. CDR-SB showed relatively high sensitivity to clinical progression in aMCI but less sensitivity to treatment effects. Overall, ADCOMS showed high sensitivity to both clinical decline and treatment effect in pAD/aMCI/mild AD dementia populations. A limitation in this development approach is that changes produced by cholinesterase inhibitors may differ from effects produced by other agents.\nA potential limitation of the ADCOMS is the fact that ADCOMS' performance was evaluated using the same data that were used to develop the instrument. This could inflate the performance of ADCOMS because of model-data dependence. To address this potential effect, we estimated the bias introduced by the model-data dependence and used the estimated bias to produce adjusted estimates of the ADCOMS performance. In developing ADCOMS data from ADNI, an observational study, and three interventional studies were pooled. Ideally, one would pool data only from placebo groups in interventional trials to create a new clinical outcome tool. At the present time, there exists a very limited number of MCI/MCI due to AD/pAD trial placebo groups that are publically available; to make analyses more robust, results from ADNI are frequently used as a simulated placebo-treated group when designing clinical trials as was done in development of ADCOMS.\nTo overcome these limitations, it is necessary to evaluate the performance of ADCOMS using completely independent data sets. Recently, the performance of ADCOMS in pAD participants was evaluated using an entirely independent Phase 3 data set from pAD participants. In the SCarlet RoAD (NCT01224106; WN25203) trial, 16 sensitivity to change was evaluated via MSDR for the change from baseline to Week 104 in participants randomised to placebo (n=105). ADCOMS outperformed all other outcome measures, including CDR-SB, and was the only measure considered to have a robust responsiveness to decline (0.86). These results further support our conclusion that ADCOMS represents an improved clinical approach as compared with traditional AD tools when tracking decline in pAD/MCI due to patients with AD.\nADCOMS is not a new clinical trial instrument. It is an analytic strategy based on commonly used clinical trial instruments that are administered in their entirety and are familiar to AD trial personnel. Implementation of ADCOMS as an outcome approach in pAD/aMCI/mild AD dementia trials will be based on standard administration of conventional clinical trial instruments with analysis of the collected data, as specified by the ADCOMS methodology. ADCOMS consists of 12 items of which six are the CDR domains, five are performance-based items from ADAS-cog and MMSE; one ADAS-cog item, word finding difficulty, is judgement dependent. The six CDR items also are highly dependent on input from a caregiver and on the examiner's judgement. The composition of ADCOMS includes items from three performance-based tests-ADAS-cog, MMSE and CDR. The ADCOMS has more performance-based measures than the CDR-SB and may offer a more objective outcome assessment.\nThe Critical Path Institute was launched by the FDA to support activities leading to safer, faster and more efficient clinical trials. This Institute provides funding to CAMD and has the responsibility of promoting development of new clinical outcomes. The Coalition has adopted ADCOMS for qualification as a primary outcome measure in trials of pAD/aMCI."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Our results indicate that ADCOMS optimises sensitivity to clinical disease progression and specificity to the clinical decline that is characteristic of AD in the early stages. ADCOMS is more sensitive to change and treatment effects than individual trial instruments. Use of ADCOMS may enable using smaller sample sizes to demonstrate a drug-placebo difference. ADCOMS may be used as an AD clinical outcomes approach in trials of 12 months' duration or longer targeting participants with aMCI, pAD and mild AD dementia.
