We focused on patients who underwent lipid testing on 3 or more occasions during that year. Administrative data do not contain sufficient information to determine which individual instances of multiple lipid testing may be appropriate versus overutilization.

The Medicaid indicator was a proxy of low socioeconomic status or disability. Residential hospital referral region (HRR) was identified by the zip code crosswalk provided by the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care. Size of residential area was categorized by Rural-Urban Continuum Codes.\nA prior diagnosis of any lipid disorder (ICD 9: 277.0 -277.4), or other indications for lipid testing including hypertension, hypertensive heart disease, ischemic heart disease, stroke, atherosclerosis, peripheral vascular diseases, and diabetes were generated using inpatient and outpatient billing data in 2005 and 2006. Also, any hospitalization during 2005-2006 with a primary discharge diagnosis for a car-diovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or diabetes, was recorded.\nWe identified outpatient visits using American Medical Association-Common Procedure Terminology evaluation and management codes 99201 to 99205 (new patient), 99221 to 99215 (established patient encounters), and 99241 to 99245 (outpatient consultation). Individual providers were identified by their Unique Provider Identification Number. Physician specialty was based on Part B. Those with multiple specialty codes were assigned the specialty that appeared most often in the claims. Primary care physicians were defined as general practitioner, family physician, internist, or geriatrician. A usual care physician (UCP) was defined as the one who examined the patient on 3 or more occasions in an outpatient setting during the year. 14 Total number of physician visits and total number of UCPs seen in 2006 (2005 in some analyses) were calculated for each beneficiary. We also retrieved 2006 "}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analyses", "text": "We calculated the percentage of beneficiaries who received 0, 1, 2, or \u05463 lipid tests in 2006, and stratified the results by selected patient characteristics, indications for lipid testing, and outpatient physician care. The effect of patient characteristics, type of outpatient care received, and clinical indications for lipid testing on receipt of multiple lipid testing (defined as \u05463 or more lipid tests) was evaluated using logistic regression models. Least square regression models were built to explore the association between multiple lipid testing, the percent of beneficiaries who saw 3 or more UCPs, and total Medicare expenditures across HRRs. All analyses were performed with SAS version 9.1 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC). Table 1 presents the characteristics of the 1,151,891 men and women aged 66 years and older who comprised the final sample and the percentages of subjects who underwent 0, 1, 2, or 3 or more measurements of serum lipids in an outpatient setting in 2006. Overall, 11.9% of subjects underwent multiple testing. There was a little change with age up to 80 years, with some reduction in those aged more than 80 years. Differences by gender and race were also small. Given the large number of subjects, even small differences will be statistically different. Therefore, it is more important to focus on the magnitude of any changes rather than tests of significance."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Patients with a diagnosis of a lipid disorder were more likely to undergo multiple testing, as were patients who had specific indications for screening, such as diagnoses of hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. There was a very strong relationship between multiple lipid testing and the number of different physicians seen in an outpatient setting during the year, ranging from 5.7% in patients who saw 0 or 1 outpatient physicians to 20.2% for those who saw 5 or more different physicians. There were similar patterns between multiple testing and total number of outpatient physician encounters during the year.\nThe rate of multiple testing increased with the number of different UCPs providing care for a patient. We further categorized patients by the type of UCPs caring for them, such as generalists, medical subspecialists, surgeons, or other physicians. The relationship between the number of UCPs and multiple testing was strongest for medical subspecialist and generalist UCPs ( Table 1) .\nFor patients who underwent lipid testing on 3 or more different occasions in 2006, the mean number of physicians ordering these tests was 1.4 \u03ee 0.7 (standard deviation). This increased to a mean of 2.1 \u03ee 1.3 for patients who underwent 6 or more lipid tests.\nThe geographic variation in multiple lipid testing is shown in Figure 1 . Rates of multiple testing varied from \u03fd4% in Casper, WY and Grand Junction, CO to \u03fe24% in Fort Lauderdale and Miami, FL and McAllen, TX. We also assessed the temporal stability of rates of multiple testing. The rates in any given HRR varied little from 2005 to 2006. Table 2 presents the results of 2 multivariable analyses looking at the independent association of patient and medical care characteristics on multiple lipid testing. Model 1 contains the number of different generalist UCPs seen, while Model 2 adds the total number of outpatient provider visits and the number of UCPs who were internal medicine subspecialists. All 3 measurements (generalist UCPs, subspecialist UCPs, and total physician visits) were associated with multiple lipid testing independent of each other and of patient characteristics and clinical indications. We repeated the analyses (indicated in Table 2 ) using the number of UCPs seen and the total number of physician encounters generated from 2005 data and used to predict multiple testing in 2006. In those analyses, the number of UCPs seen and total outpatient visits in 2005 was a significant predictor of receipt of multiple testing in 2006. For example, patients who had a 0, 1, or \u05462 internal medicine subspecial-ists as UCPs in 2005 had 1.00 (reference), 1.29 (95% confidence interval \u03ed 1.27, 1.31), and 1.63 (1.58, 1.67) odds of undergoing multiple lipid testing in 2006.\nFinally, we assessed the relationship at the level of the HRR between the rate of multiple outpatient lipid testing and overall Medicare expenditures. This is plotted for the 306 HRRs in the United States in Figure 2 . There is close association between the 2 measures, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.56. There was also a strong relationship between multiple lipid testing and the percent of patients seeing \u05462 generalist UCPs or \u05462 medical subspecialist UCPs during the year (r \u03ed 0.45 and 0.62, respectively). To assess whether the presence of multiple providers mediated the relationship between rate of multiple lipid testing and Medicare spending, we performed a partial correlation between multiple testing and total Medicare expenditures while adjusting for the percent of patients in the HRR who saw \u05462 generalist UCPs or \u05462 subspecialist UCPs in the year (partial r \u03ed 0.43 and 0.31, respectively)."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Inappropriate or duplicative medical testing has been a subject of concern for several decades. 16, 17 Studies documenting unnecessary testing and the development of interventions to reduce such behavior greatly expanded with the growth of managed care. 18 -24 Duplication of testing involves different issues from the broader issue of inappropriate testing. In particular, the issues of fragmentation of care and impaired access to relevant information by treating physicians would seem to be more important.\nSome studies have documented duplication of testing across transitions in medical care, particularly from outpatient to hospitalization and back. 16 In this study, we did not include lipid measurements of patients while hospitalized. Our data on repetitive testing are based only on outpatient testing, and thus underestimate total repetitive testing.\nOf course, not all repetitive testing of lipids is inappropriate. One can imagine clinical situations where obtaining 3 or more tests in a year is consistent with good medical practice; for example, when lipid-lowering therapy is initiated or adjusted. Because of that, we can conclude very little from the absolute rates of repetitive testing. What is more of interest is the pattern of repetitive testing, and the role of multiple providers.\nTwo different components appear to be associated with the patterns of multiple testing, with different implications. The first is different providers ordering the test on the same patient. Multiple testing increased with the number of UCPs, independent of the total number of outpatient physician visits. Such testing could be caused by impaired access to laboratory results across different physician groups. The second component of multiple lipid testing seems to relate to a general increased utilization of medical resources. The level of average Medicare expenditures explained 31% of the variance in multiple lipid testing at the level of the HRR. These 2 components have different implications. The popular response for problems stemming from impaired access to information is the electronic medical record. [25] [26] [27] [28] The ability of an electronic medical record to reduce test duplication depends to the extent it is accessible by providers across different organizations, which remains a challenge. 29 The finding that multiple testing of lipids reflects increased medical expenditure in general was expected. Sirovich et al 30, 31 have shown that physicians in high cost areas are more likely to order tests of questionable benefit. Medicare enrollees moving from low cost to high cost areas are more likely to undergo testing and receive more diagnoses. 12 The relationship between spending and multiple testing appeared to be mediated in part via the presence of multiple providers, particularly multiple subspecialty providers. Although Medicare expenditures explained 31% of the variation in multiple outpatient lipid testing among HRRs, this dropped to 9% after the percentage of patients with 2 or more UCPs who were medical subspecialists was added to the analysis.\nThis study has a number of limitations. The absence of information on lipid testing while hospitalized has been mentioned. We also discussed above the inability to determine what portion of the lipid testing might be medically appropriate. In addition, we only assessed testing in patients enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare. Medicare managed care patients may well have different results. The indications for lipid testing were based on diagnoses included in physician charges, which may be incomplete. Different health referral regions in the United States may differ somewhat in the percent of Medicare enrollees with indications for testing.\nThe studies of overutilization of medical care have evolved from the seminal work by the Dartmouth group on supply side factors 10, 11 to include consideration of variations in practice styles among physicians in different regions. 12, 30, 31 This present study suggests that organizational factors resulting in multiple providers might interact with these other factors in influencing medical expenditures."}]
