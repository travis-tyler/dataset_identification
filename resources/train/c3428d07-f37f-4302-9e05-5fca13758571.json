[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Return periods or recurrence intervals can be defined as the percent chance of exceeding a certain threshold over 1 year. An example of this is a 100-year flood event, or event consisting of a 1 in 100 chance or 1% chance of occurring over 1 year. Insurance companies and public entities use return periods to understand the risk and prepare for catastrophic extremes. Using catastrophe models to simulate events, modelers can produce return periods based on historical and simulated results to understand these outlying events. Gridded data of 100-year (1%) and 500-year (0.2%) storm surge flood elevations for the East Coast of the United States and Gulf of Mexico are critical to understanding this natural hazard. In this project, storm surge heights were calculated across the study area utilizing NOAA's National Weather Service SLOSH (Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes) model data for thousands of synthetic hurricanes making landfall in the US. Based on the results derived from SLOSH, a series of interpolated surfaces were produced using spatial analysis in a geographic information system (GIS) at both the SLOSH basin and the synthetic event levels. The result was a single grid of maximum flood elevations for each synthetic event (Nong et al., 2010). The former process relied on separate code to read the results and calculate the statistics before these results could be used in the GIS for visualization. This project fills this gap so that all work is contained in a single standard geospatial environment."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": "The process begins with point data from the SLOSH model for one synthetic storm event. The data points for each basin within the synthetic event are interpolated and a grid at approximately 2 km. is created ( Figure 1). The grid is coincident to a larger grid at a similar resolution and is used to produce results for the entire geographic area (Figure 2). An additional series of interpolations based on Empirical Bayesian Kriging, a kriging method that automates a number of kriging parameters (O'Sullivan and Unwin, 2010 and ESRI, 2012), are then computed across the synthetic storm event to produce a grid at the same resolution for the storm event ( Figure 3). This raster result contains storm surge heights across the spatial domain of the synthetic event. This process is then repeated through Python code for the remaining synthetic events.   Utilizing NumPy, the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, each resulting grid showing storm surge for a synthetic event is converted to a NumPy array. A three-dimensional NumPy array is then created by stacking each two-dimensional event array vertically (Figure 4). Through the use of Python indexing, the storm surge height values for each event at each grid cell can easily be retrieved. These values are then fit to an extreme value curve using the genpareto library within the SciPy statistical package (Coles, 2001). 100-year and 500year values for each cell are returned based on the sample fitting as shown in Figure 5. Finally, the resulting 100-year and 500-year NumPy arrays are converted to raster grids."}, {"section_title": "Implementing Extreme Value Analysis in a Geospatial Workflow for Assessing Storm Surge Hazards | Jason Catelli", "text": "Page 6 of 10  "}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The process highlighted in Figure 6 details the workflow produced in this project. Raster data was successfully converted to NumPy array structures. Through Python code, storm surge height values for each synthetic event were returned at each individual cell. After importing the SciPy statistical package, the values collected at each cell were fit to a general extreme value distribution. 100-year and 500-year values at each grid cell were returned and converted back to raster grids for further geospatial analysis and visualization. It is important to note that while the process was successful, memory errors surfaced due to the vast size of the datasets produced.  The event values at a single cell are fit to an extreme value curve using the SciPy.stats library within Python. Based on the fitting, 100-year and 500-year values are determined for the cell. The process is repeated for the remaining grid cells and the arrays are converted back to raster datasets representing 100-year and 500-year storm surge heights."}]
