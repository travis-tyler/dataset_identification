Human resources are indeed recognised as being key to the creation, commercialisation and diffusion of innovations. In addition to the statistical work, the OECD has therefore organised a series of workshops on the supply and demand of HRST, the place and role of women in the scientific workforce, the attractiveness of research careers and the international mobility of researchers. 1 Doctorate holders are not only the most qualified in terms of educational attainment, but also those who are trained to undertake research careers. However, no internationally comparable indicators to track their demand, supply and mobility in the the labour market were available. This is why the CDH activity started with a workshop aimed at identifying user needs for indicators in this area.

Previous work by the OECD had explored the potential of graduate and/or doctorate surveys. 2 An inventory of existing sources had shown that several surveys existed at national level and that they provided valuable information for the understanding of career patterns and mobility of doctorate holders and of researchers, who are recruited for a large part among doctorate holders. However, the surveys had been developed to serve national statistical needs and priorities and were not harmonised internationally. This limited the scope for international comparisons and failed to capture some important characteristics of this cadre of talents, such as their international experience or mobility. With the organisation of the workshop on user needs in September 2004, the OECD launched a collaborative project aimed at developing internationally comparable indicators on the careers and mobility of doctorate holders building on existing national experiences. An important element of this work was to measure the mobility of doctorate holders both within a country and across borders -issues that were of main concern to policy makers around the world. The interest in cross-border movement underscored the need for surveys and indicators to be internationally comparable, and for the OECD to partner with other relevant international organisations, namely the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) and Eurostat (the Statistical Office of the European Community). The OECD/UIS/Eurostat CDH project was therefore launched."}, {"section_title": "2.", "text": "A An expert group was formed drawn from representatives of the national statistical bodies with competence in the area.

These statistics try to answer questions about the international mobility of highly skilled workers, as such frequently characterised under the headings of brain drain / brain gain / brain circulation. In addition, issues of qualitative and quantitative adequacy of the education of doctorates for the labour market are concerned as well as if the national labour markets prevail to be the primary frame for this highly skilled group. They also address questions of how well the skills of the highest educated are used by the society as well as the attractiveness of different career paths for doctorate holders. Questions like these often are asked on a worldwide level. Based on an output-harmonised approach, the tabulated data to be delivered by countries to international organisations are compiled on the base of different methodological approaches. Often, already existing national surveys can be used that sometimes might need to be complemented or extended. These guidelines therefore provide the general framework for national data production. They should on the one hand help countries to improve and align their national survey methodologies. On the other hand, countries that are newly introducing CDH surveys find orientation on how to do this at the national level."}, {"section_title": "PURPOSE OF STATISTICS ON CDH", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "2.1", "text": "Why doctorate holders? Doctorate holders, being the highest educated group, are considered most likely to contribute to the advancement and diffusion of knowledge and technologies. As such, they often are seen as one of the key actors behind the creation of innovation and knowledge-based economic growth. The CDH statistics will mainly focus on doctorate holders, but the same type of statistics could of course apply to other types of \"highly qualified people\". This might for example be the case in some developing countries where highly qualified non-doctorate holders might constitute a crucial part of the S&T workforce and thus a target group for policy issue."}, {"section_title": "Needs expressed by users", "text": "The user needs for statistics on CDH were thoroughly discussed during a series of workshops across 2003 and 2004. One of the aims of these workshops was to define links between research questions and data needs, thus setting the objectives for the data collection of statistics on CDH. The policy questions observed at the national and international level are summarised under the following four headings: \u2022 The role of doctorate holders in innovation and the knowledge economy Where do doctorate holders work as compared to other tertiary graduates? What is their productivity? \u2022 Labour market supply and demand Do we train too many or too few doctorate holders? Are there mismatches in the labour market?

This survey in principle covers the complete target population, but some limitations can be expected: e.g. the low frequency of these surveys and, more importantly, the non-systematic separate identification of doctorate holders in some countries.

Below they are categorised into three different main types: graduate surveys, cohort surveys and cross-sectional retrospective surveys. These three survey types are ordered according to their degree of coverage of the target population but some specific advantages could also be identified in each type. The three surveys should thus not be seen as mutually excluding, but rather complementary. Countries could opt for one or for a combination of surveys that provides the most cost-efficient national data collection. The sampling frames and their qualities are of course of crucial importance for the quality of the results. The complementary coverage of the different sampling frames used in the different survey types needs to correspond to the CDH target population.

This type of survey is especially suitable for collecting information on the doctorate programme, the education history and conditions during the years of study. A graduate survey is also the appropriate means for obtaining information on post-graduation plans and could be the only point of contact with doctorate holders that plan to leave the country, including those that return to their country of origin. A graduate survey should preferably be conducted regularly on all nationally awarded doctorate holders, including foreigners, as soon as possible after graduation. Information on educational history and the doctorate programme itself (e.g. source of funding and time to completion) is best obtained as soon after graduation as possible. Co-operation with the educational institutions should be sought to take advantage of their information systems and established contact with the respondents. If the educational institutions could obtain survey results pertaining to their own graduates, their motivation to participate should be high. Records obtained through a graduate survey should be stored and used to build a register of nationally awarded doctorate holders. Besides being a useful source of information, such a register could in the future also be used to construct sampling frames for cohort and cross-sectional surveys."}, {"section_title": "Cohort surveys", "text": "Cohort surveys with a longitudinal approach have advantages in collecting up-to-date information about the training and working activities undertaken by doctorate holders, by following a homogeneous population over time.

However, cohort surveys on recently awarded doctorate holders can provide only limited information about long-term career developments and international mobility, which can be better investigated through a cross-sectional retrospective survey.

It should in principle include doctorates awarded from all national institutions, including foreigners, and should be based on a sampling frame where year of graduation is available. If new cohorts are regularly introduced and surveyed in parallel to older ones the coverage with regard to the CDH target population will increase in the course of time."}, {"section_title": "Cross-sectional retrospective surveys", "text": "A cross-sectional survey should cover doctorate holders from many different cohorts, awarded within the country and abroad. Through retrospective questions, the cross-sectional survey should provide a good picture of the career paths of doctorate holders at different stages of their career. The cross-sectional survey is thus the most appropriate tool if information on the entire target population is to be obtained through one single survey. Cross-sectional surveys have the advantage of also including in their target population the important populations of doctorate holders awarded abroad, normally not included in graduate surveys and cohort surveys. As information on this particular group is considered most important for the CDH project countries should make strong efforts to assure the full coverage of this group."}, {"section_title": "Stratification", "text": "Cohort surveys and graduate surveys should, if they are carried out as sample surveys, be stratified according to at least two main criteria, graduating institution and field of science. For cross-sectional sample surveys, stratification is needed with regard to the structure of the target population and the possible use of multiple sources to build the sampling frames. In statistical surveys, the number of domains needed often determines the number of strata. However, for multipurpose statistics like the CDH statistics, the number of domains will often exceed the desirable number of strata. Since a too high number of strata could lead to a problem with too few observations in some strata, it is important to keep stratification at a reasonable level. The most obvious and significant stratification is to break down the population according to the sampling frames applied. As strata should be as homogenous as possible with respect to the principal variables analysed, further recommended breakdowns are according to the characteristics year of graduation, fields of science, and gender."}, {"section_title": "Allocation and sampling", "text": "The allocation of the sample on the strata may in principle be proportional with regard to the stratum size. If the allocation ends up giving too small a sample size in some strata, then over sampling may be considered for these strata. Over-sampling might also be considered in strata where high levels of nonresponse could be expected. Total sample size should be chosen taking into account the detailed breakdowns in the output indicators template. The selection of the sample should be based on random sampling techniques, with known and equal selection probabilities being applied for each stratum. The random sampling techniques should be without replacement within each stratum."}, {"section_title": "COLLECTION AND PROCESSING OF DATA", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data collection methods", "text": "When collecting CDH statistics, a mixed-mode data collection adapted to the possibilities available within each sampling frame and to each individual's willingness to respond could be considered the most successful alternative. This approach, applied by most countries conducting surveys on doctorate holders, includes the use of existing data, postal and Internet surveys, telephone interviews and personal interviews. Postal surveys are most commonly used and have the advantage of being relatively inexpensive. Under some circumstances, the delivery agent may also bring back information on the new addresses of people who moved during the most recent past. Both postal and telephone reminders may be used to increase the response rate. Computer assisted telephone interviews (CATI) and personal interviews (CAPI) are techniques where interviewers play an active role in collecting information from respondents. Although quite costly they could be justified by the high rates of response that they normally achieve. CATI and CAPI techniques are especially useful in boosting the response rates of a postal survey. Many national practices exist where countries give the respondent the opportunity to fill in the questionnaire electronically on the Internet. The use of questionnaires that can be accessed on-line by the Internet is recommended as an alternative to other means of collection after the contact with the respondent has been established. In the special case of graduate surveys, the graduating institutions should preferably be involved in the data collection. The institutions could considerably facilitate the data collection process by distributing and collecting the questionnaire together with their administrative requirements for graduations."}, {"section_title": "5.2", "text": "The CDH model questionnaire Since the CDH statistics are based on an output-harmonised approach, countries could decide what survey instruments to use.

In order to facilitate the task for the respondents, an instruction manual has been developed. The model questionnaire should be used by countries that are going to launch a self-standing CDH survey for the first time. In addition, countries that want to revise their existing national questionnaires are encouraged to align them by using the selection of questions presented in the model questionnaire.
