[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Latent growth curve models with spline functions are flexible and accessible statistical tools for investigating nonlinear change patterns that exhibit distinct phases of development in manifested variables. Among such models, the bilinear spline growth model (BLSGM) is the most straightforward and intuitive but useful. An existing study has demonstrated that the BLSGM allows the knot (or inflection point), at which two linear segments join together, to be an additional growth factor other than the intercept and slopes so that researchers can estimate the knot and its variability in the framework of individual measurement occasions. However, developmental processes are rarely isolated and the joint development where the change patterns of two constructs and their changes are related over time. As an extension of the existing BLSGM with an unknown knot, this study considers a parallel BLSGM (PBLSMG) for investigating two nonlinear growth processes and estimating the knot with its variability of each process as well as the association between the knots in the framework of individual measurement occasions. We present the proposed model by simulation studies and a real-world data analysis. Our simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed PBLSGM generally estimate the parameters of interest unbiasedly, precisely and exhibit appropriate confidence interval coverage. An empirical example using longitudinal mathematics scores and reading scores shows that the model can estimate the knot with its variance for each growth curve and the covariance between two knots. We also provide the corresponding code for the proposed model."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Longitudinal analysis plays an essential role in various disciplines to investigate how the metrics of interest change over time. When analyzing such repeated measures, it is of interest to investigate the between-individual difference in within-individual change. The change patterns are likely to exhibit a nonconstant relationship to the time to some extent if the study duration under examination is long enough. One possible model to assess the individually nonlinear change pattern is the linear spline growth model (LSGM) (Grimm et al., 2016) , which is also referred to as a piecewise linear latent growth model (Kohli, 2011; Sterba, 2014) . With attached at least two linear pieces (see Figure A .1), the linear spline (or piecewise linear) growth curve is capable of approximating more complex underlying change patterns. It has been widely employed in multiple areas, for example, intellectual development (Marcoulides, 2018) , the learning process of a specific task (Cudeck and Klebe, 2002) , the onset of alcohol abuse (Li et al., 2001) , the post-surgical recovery process (Dumenci et al., 2019; Riddle et al., 2015) .\nWhen analyzing a growth curve model with a linear spline functional form, other than growth factors such as intercepts and slopes, the locations of the inflection points or 'knots' at which the change in the process has occurred must be determined. Driven by domain theories, empirical researchers may pre-specified knot locations (Dumenci et al., 2019; Flora, 2008; Riddle et al., 2015; Sterba, 2014) . Marcoulides (2018) also proposed an algorithm to detect the knot locations automatically. Kohli (2011) ; ; ; Kohli et al. (2015a,b) ; Kwok et al. (2010) ; Liu (2019) ; Liu et al. (2019) have demonstrated that how to estimate knots in a much more flexible framework.\nThe most straightforward but useful linear spline function is a bilinear spline growth model (BLSGM, or linear-linear piecewise model) . This functional form helps identify a process that is theoretically to be two stages with different rates of change (Dumenci et al., 2019; Riddle et al., 2015; Liu, 2019) ; more importantly, it is also capable of approximating other nonlinear trajectories (Kohli et al., 2015a; Liu et al., 2019) . Harring et al. (2006) developed a BLSGM to estimate a fixed knot with the assumption that the knot is identical for all individuals. They unified the functional form of two linear pieces through reparameterization by re-expressing growth factors as linear combinations of their original form.\nThe proposed model has been demonstrated useful for examining the development in each stage and estimating a fixed knot for procedural learning task research . By relaxing the assumption of the same knot location across all individuals, Preacher and Hancock (2015) extended the BLSGM to estimate a knot and its variance simultaneously, where the knot is treated as an additional growth factor besides the intercept and two slopes. For interpretation purposes, Kohli (2011) , , Grimm et al. (2016) and Liu (2019) , Liu et al. (2019) provided the inverse-transformation matrices, which allow the reparameterized mean vector and variance-covariance matrix to be transformed back to the original parameterization, for the BLSGM to estimate a fixed knot and that to estimate a knot with its variance, respectively. However, developmental processes usually correlate with each other; accordingly, empirical researchers often desire to understand a joint development of at least two metrics of interest. One possible statistical method to analyze repeated measures of multiple constructs simultaneously is a parallel process and correlated growth model (McArdle, 1988) , also referred to as a multivariate growth model (MGM) (Grimm et al., 2016) . For example, Robitaille et al. (2012) detected a significant intercept-intercept and slope-slope association in processing speed and visuospatial ability by employing the MGM with linear growth curves. However, to our knowledge, no existing studies provide parallel nonlinear change patterns to assess at least two associated developmental processes. In this work, we propose parallel BLSGM (PBLSGM) by extending the BLSGM , which estimates a knot with its variance, to the multivariate growth model framework. With the PBLSGM, it is of interest to assess the knot-knot association other than the intercept-intercept and slope-slope association between at least two repeated outcomes. We also extend the transformation and inverse-transformation matrices of growth factors in the original and reparameterized settings developed in the Liu et al. (2019) to the PBLSGM, so the estimates of it are interpretable.\nLike Liu et al. (2019) did, we propose the PBLSGM in the framework of individual measurement occasions due to possible heterogeneity in the measurement time in a longitudinal study (Cook and Ware, 1983; Finkel et al., 2003; Mehta and West, 2000) . This can occur when participants vary in age at each measurement occasion in developmental and aging studies where the response is most sensitive to changes in age rather than the measurement time. Another possible scenario of heterogeneity in the measurement occasion may result from such as when longitudinal responses are self-initiated. For example, in an adolescent smoking study, the longitudinal records were collected from questionnaires that were asked to complete on pocket computers immediately after smoking (Hedeker and Gibbons, 2006) . We fit the proposed PBLSGM with individual measurement occasions using the definition variable approach, where the \"definition variables\" are defined as manifested variables that can help to adjust model parameters to individual-specific values (Mehta and West, 2000; Mehta and Neale, 2005) . In our case, these individual-specific values are individual measurement occasions. To our knowledge, it is the first study that demonstrates how to incorporate the definition variables in parallel growth curve models.\nThe proposed model fills an existing gap by describing how to fit a PBLSGM in the framework of individually-varying time points (ITPs) to estimate the knot with its variance for the growth curve of each repeated measures and the knot-knot association as well as intercept-intercept, slope-slope association. In this current work, we have three major goals. First, we aim to capture characteristics of parallel individual trajectories with linear-linear piecewise functional form and analyze the associations between multiple developmental processes. More importantly, for the proposed model, we desire to make the statistical inference and interpret the estimates in the original parameter setting. Second, with the definition variable approach, we fit the model in the framework of individual measurement occasions due to its omnipresence in longitudinal studies. Third, we provide a set of recommendations for real-world practice by demonstrating how to apply the proposed model to a real data set.\nThe remainder of this article is organized as follows. In the method section, we first present the model specification of the PBLSGM to estimate a knot with its variance for the growth curve of each longitudinal response and the knot-knot association. Next, we extend the (inverse-)transformation matrix proposed by Liu (2019) to the PBLSGM framework and demonstrate how to parameterize growth factors in this model to make them estimable and transform them back after estimation for interpretation purposes. We also propose one possible reduced PBLSGM to estimate knots without considering variability as a parsimonious backup. We next describe the model estimation and the Monte Carlo simulation design for model evaluation. In the section of the simulation result, we present the evaluation of the model performance in terms of non-convergent rate, the proportion of improper solutions, the estimating effects, which includes the bias, the root-mean-squared-error (RSME) and the empirical coverage for a nominal 95% confidence interval of each parameter of interest. Then by applying the proposed PBLSGM to a data set of longitudinal reading scores and mathematics scores from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010 \u2212 11 (ECLS-K: 2011), we provide a collection of feasible recommendations for empirical practice. Finally, discussions are framed regarding the model's limitations as well as future directions."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Model Specification", "text": "Suppose we have bivariate growth curves, in the framework of individual measurement occasions, the PBLSGM with unknown knots is given by\nwhere y i and z i are J \u00d7 1 vectors of the repeated outcomes Y and Z for the i th person (where J is the number of measurements), respectively. \u039b i (\u03b3 [u] i ) (u = y, z), which is a function of an endpoint-specific unknown knot \u03b3 [u] i , is a J \u00d7 3 matrix of factor loadings determined by definition variables. \u03b7\n2i ) T , for an intercept and two slopes of the repeated outcome U ) of the i th individual, which are further written as deviations from their endpoint-specific means\nwhere \u00b5 [u] \u03b7 is a 3 \u00d7 1 vector of means of growth factors and \u03b6 [u] i is a 3 \u00d7 1 vector of deviations of the i th subject from factor means of the repeated outcome U .

This model, which specifies a nonlinear relationship between repeated outcomes and the growth factors, cannot be estimated in the structural equation modeling (SEM) framework directly (Grimm et al., 2016) . Followed by Liu (2019) ; Liu et al. (2019) , each repeated outcome in the proposed model can be reparameterized (Tishler and Zang, 1981; Seber and Wild, 2003; Liu, 2019; Liu et al., 2019) and then expressed as a linear combination of all four endpoint-specific growth factors through the Taylor series expansion (Browne and du Toit, 1991; Grimm et al., 2016; Liu, 2019; Liu et al., 2019 ) (see Appendix A.1 and A.2 for details of reparameterization and Taylor series expansion).\nWe then express the endpoint-specific reparameterized growth factors and the corresponding factor loadings for the i th individual as\nrespectively, where \u00b5 [u] \u03b3 is the endpoint-specific knot mean and \u03b4 [u] i is the deviation from the knot mean of the i th individual.

Descriptive statistics and visualization are useful tools for empirical researchers to decide proper initial values for the parameters. However, this decision is not straightforward for the reparameterized parameters. To help select initial values, Liu et al. (2019) proposed transformation matrics to re-express the mean vector and variance-covariance matrix of growth factors in the original setting as those in the reparameterized setting for a BLSGM to estimate an unknown knot with its variability. They also developed inverse-transformation matrics to transform the mean vector and variance-covariance matrix of reparameterized growth factors to the original setting so the estimates are interpretable. By extending that work, we demonstrate how to implement these (inverse-)transformation matrics in the PBLSGM.\nAs shown in Equation (3), for the i th individual, the relathionship between the endpoint-specific growth factors in the oritinal setting (\u03b7 [u] i ) and those in the reparameterized framework (\u03b7 [ u] i ) are G [u] i and G \u22121[u] i that are given by\nThe endpoint-specific (inverse-)transformation matrix, like the matrix of BLSGM , is individual-level due to the knot variability.

(2019) , the primary focus of this study was to investigate how the performance of PBLSGM affected by the correlation between the growth patterns of two repeated outcomes. Accordingly, we did not investigate some conditions, such as the knot variance and the standardized difference between two slopes, that have demonstrated a clear pattern with the model performance of BLSGM in Liu et al. (2019) . Instead, we set the knot standard deviation as 0.3 to be a moderate level of individual difference in each knot, and we adjusted the standardized difference between two slopes to satisfy other conditions that are of more interest in this study. In addition, as shown in Table 1 , we considered ten scaled and equally spaced waves since Liu et al. (2019) has presented that the BLSGM performed decently under the conditions with ten repeated measures and fewer follow-up time only affect model performance slightly. Around each wave, we allowed a time-window with a width (\u22120.25, +0.25), which was a 'medium' deviation as Coulombe et al. (2015) , for individual measurement occasions. We also fixed the variance-covariance matrix of within-construct growth factors since this matrix usually changes with the measurement scale and the time scale. Besides, the endpoint-specific growth factors were set to be positively correlated to a moderate degree (\u03c1 = 0.3). Additionally, guided by several existing studies (Bauer and Curran, 2003; Kohli, 2011; Kohli et al., 2015b; Liu et al., 2019) , we kept the index of dispersion (\u03c3 2 /\u00b5) of each growth factor at a tenth scale."}, {"section_title": "=========================", "text": "Insert Table 1 about here ========================= In the simulation design, we considered the between-construct growth factor correlation as positive (0.3), negative (\u22120.3) and zero (0) to evaluate how the association between two growth curves affects the model performance of PBLSGM. Additionally, we examine several common change patterns as shown in Table 1 (Scenario 1, 2 and 3). For each scenario, we changed the knot locations (set the knots of the trajectories of two repeated outcomes to be the same or different) and one growth factor and fixed the other two growth factors to investigate how the trajectory shape impacts the model. For the precision of measurements, we considered \u03b8 [u] = 1 or \u03b8 [u] = 2 as two levels of homogeneous residual variances for each repeated measurements and set the residual correlation as 0.3. We also considered two levels of sample size.\nInsert Table 2 about here ========================= We also examined the pattern of improper solutions, includes negative estimations of growth factor variances and/or out-of-range (i.e., beyond [\u22121, 1]) growth factor correlations. Table 2 demonstrates the number of improper solutions yielded by the proposed model under all conditions, which include negative knot variances and its out-of-range (i.e., out of [\u22121, 1]) correlations with any other growth factors from the same or the other construct. From the table, we noted that the conditions with real parallel trajectories of two repeated outcomes (i.e., the conditions with Scenario 1 of which both slopes of one construct were set as the same with the other construct) suffered improper solutions less frequently though different first slopes (Scenario 2) or second slopes (Scenario 3) only affected the proportion of improper solution slightly. Additionally, the small sample size or less precise measurements increased the proportion of improper solutions. We replaced the PBLSGM with its reduced model for the model evaluation if such improper solutions emerged.\nInsert Table 3 about here =========================\nInsert Table 4 about here =========================\nWe also present the biases generated by the proposed PBLSGM for each parameter of interest in PBLSGM under all conditions in Appendix B (Figures B.1, B.2 and B. 3). From these plots, we observed the following interesting patterns. First, the magnitude or sign of the intercept-intercept, slope-slope and knot-knot correlation seemed not to affect the model performance. Second, the non-zero difference in knot locations of two constructs affected the model performance, but such influence was different on two repeated outcomes. Specifically, the upward biases of the first slope mean and variance of Y inflated while those of the second slope mean and variance of Y deflated. However, it oppositely impacted those estimates of Z. Third, the trajectory shape did not affect the biases meaningfully, but less precise measurements increased the biases. Table 5 presents the median (range) of the coverage probability (CP) of each parameter of interest for the proposed PBLSGMs. Both models exhibited proper CPs for the intercept means and variances, intercept-intercept covariance and slope means in general. However, only the full PBLSGM demonstrated decent coverages for other parameters of interest, including knot means and variances, slope variances, slope-slope covariances and knot-knot covariance.\nInsert Figure 1 about here ========================= Table 6 provides the obtained estimated likelihood, information criteria (including AIC and BIC), residuals of each parallel growth curve model.

Post-knot development in reading skills and mathematical skills slowed down substantially. On average, for the reading ability, the development rates were 2.052 and 0.687 per month in the pre-and post-knot stage, respectively. These rates for the mathematical ability were 1.794 and 0.743. The knot of the reading skills and mathematical skills was estimated at 94and 100-month (both around 8-year old) on average.

As shown in Figure 1 , although the reading ability of children was underestimated, the PBLSGMs fit better than the models with parallel parametric nonlinear curves to the first two or three measures.

More importantly, we extended (inverse-) transformation matrics in an existing study to the PBLSGM framework to help select proper initial values and in turn to accelerate the computational process as well as make a statistical inference and interpret the estimates in the original framework. For both PBLSGMs, we performed in-depth analyses in terms of the non-convergent rate, improper solutions, and estimating effects including the bias, RMSE and coverage probability of each parameter of interest through simulation studies. We also illustrated the proposed models using an empirical data set obtained from a longitudinal study of reading skills and mathematical skills. The results demonstrate valuable capabilities of estimating the knots, their variances and covariance in the framework of individual measurement occasions as well as interpreting the estimates from the models. Across all conditions in the simulation design, both PBLSGM converged satisfactorily-the convergence rate of the full model achieved at least 97% while that of the reduced model was 100%. Additionally, as shown in the application section, the full PBLSGM was capable of achieving convergence status without computational burdens. We also noticed that the full model might suffer an issue of improper solutions, including negative knot variances and out-of-range knot correlations with other growth factors, within-or between-constructs. It is not surprising since the knot variances were set at a moderate level, 0.3. In terms of estimating effects, the full PBLSGM was capable of estimating the parameters unbiasedly, precisely and exhibiting appropriate empirical coverage of nominal 95% confidence intervals.\nThe biases of estimates produced by its reduced form increased slightly, especially for the growth factor variances and covariances, which in turn affects the RMSEs and coverage probabilities somewhat. Accordingly, in empirical practice, we recommend employing the reduced model when the full version fails to converge or generate proper solutions though sometimes at a little cost of unbiasedness.\nWe next illustrated how to use the proposed models on a subset with n = 400 from ECLS-K: 2011 hoping to show the procedure and provide a set of recommendations for possible issues that empirical researchers may face in real practice. First, proper research questions need to be raised before conducting any analysis. These questions include whether or not to test associations between two endpoints and their nonlinear change patterns and whether to estimate a knot with considering variability for the trajectories of each construct as well as the knot-knot association or only to fit parallel nonlinear trajectories. It is worth considering either the full or reduced PBLSGM to estimate knots, their variances and covariance of a joint developmental process if it is the research interest. If the interest lies in to fit multivariate nonlinear trajectories, it may be appropriate to fit the parallel change patterns with several functional forms and the selected 'best' one. Though the fit information led to unequivocal selection in our empirical example, it is not always the case. Other criteria, such as the fit between the model-implied curve and the smooth line of the observed repeated outcome, also helps make a decision. For example, the PBLSGMs are better if it is important to capture children's reading ability and mathematical ability in the early stage of the study.\nIn this article, we focused on the bivariate growth curve model with a bilinear spline functional form because it is the most straightforward but useful. The proposed model allows for several extensions. First, the functional form of the trajectories of each endpoint can be generalized to a linear spline with multiple knots or a nonlinear spline (such as a linear-polynomial or a polynomial-polynomial piecewise), which may also show useful in real data analyses. Second, though constructed in the framework of individual measurement occasions, the proposed model considers the same time structure for both repeated outcomes. However, it is accessible to be extended for a joint developmental process with varying time structure of each endpoint thanks to the definition variables approach. It is noted that the same number of repeated measures is not necessary, either. Third, it is also possible to extend the current work to address a bivariate longitudinal study with dropout under the assumption of missing at random due to the FIML technique. Additionally, we can also extend the PBLSGM to the multivariate growth curve framework with at least three constructs."}, {"section_title": "Appendix A Formula Derivation", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A.1 The Reparameterizing Procedure for endpoint-specific Growth Factors", "text": "For each repeated outcome in the original setting of a parallel bilinear spline model, we have three endpoint-specific growth factors: an intercept at t 0 (\u03b7 [u] 0 ) and one slope of each stage (\u03b7 [u] 1 and \u03b7 [u] 2 , respectively).
