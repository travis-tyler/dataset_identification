Thus, it is of enormous significance to further clarify the potential risk factors (e.g., individual diet) [3] . Regarding the role of nutrition in the prevention of cognitive disorders, increased hope has focused on a fish-oriented dietary intake (FDI), since fish is an important source of omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FAs) [4] [5] . In particular, recent studies found that n-3 FAs, including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), were present in the membranes of brain tissue [6] . Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) also functions as a protective factor in the nervous system of human subjects [7] . Furthermore, other studies reported that a diet enriched with DHA could lessen the Review www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget neurodegenerative pathology and protect from cognitive decline in aged rats [8] [9] .\nRecently, a substantial body of evidence has supported the hypothesis that the regular consumption of an FDI may decrease the risk of cardiovascular morbidity [10] and mortality [11] [12] [13] , stroke [14] , and other age-related disorders. However, the evidence from observational literature reveals an inconsistent association between FDI and the risk of cognitive decline. Some studies demonstrated that a higher FDI was associated with a lower risk of cognitive disorders [15] [16] [17] , whereas others failed to prove such protective correlations [18] [19] . One possible reason for these conflicting results is the limited capacity of dietary recall surveys and food frequency questionnaires to quantify fatty acid levels.\nGiven the uncertain evidence regarding the roles of an FDI and the risk of cognitive decline, we performed this updated systematic review by searching and analyzing published studies. In addition, this meta-analysis was limited to prospective cohort studies because casecontrolled studies might contain bias, especially when it comes to recalling previous dietary habits after cognitive disorders have been diagnosed. Also, it was assumed that the heterogeneity among results might be much smaller when similar study designs are considered."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Results of the search", "text": "The initial retrieval yielded 1635 publications.

Limited evidence of heterogeneity was found across studies or within subgroups. Overall, these analyses seemingly confirmed the inverse correlation between fish intake and the risk of DAT, whereby a higher consumption of fish could lower the risk of DAT. However, there was no statistical evidence for a link between n-3 FAs, DHA, or EPA and the risk of cognitive decline.\nDue to limited methodological quality among the included studies, no definitive correlation could be verified between FDI and the risk of cognitive decline based on the present evidence. Thus, recommendations for specific decision-making should be interpreted with caution. Further strictly designed studies with specified quantification indices are needed to confirm these findings."}, {"section_title": "Comparison of the findings with previous studies", "text": "Several studies assessing fish intake and the risk of dementia have been reported, including case reports, case series, controlled studies, and randomized controlled trials. However, no meta-analyses have focused on the correlations between a fish-oriented diet (fish, n-3 FAs, DHA, or EPA) and cognitive decline (e.g., DAT, DAC, or MCI). Thus, this is the first review to evaluate the role of FDI in the risk of cognitive disorders by searching the published literature.\nSome underlying biochemical hypotheses or other biological mechanisms could play an important role in disease progression or pathogenesis. For example, the high intake of n-3 FAs from fish or fish-related sources could reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease; therefore, it could potentially decrease the risk of DAT or other types of dementia via vascular mechanisms [25] . Furthermore, DAT could also be influenced by a fish-oriented diet via other mechanisms. Insulin resistance was connected to a higher consumption of fish-related fats, whereas high concentrations of insulin might be associated with a high risk of DAT [26] [27] . In addition, a high consumption of fats probably accelerated the oxidation of carbohydrate energy [28] ; this process could contribute to cardiovascular diseases and result in DAT or other types of dementia.\nMoreover, several findings showed a role for fishrelated fat consumption in the pathogenesis of DAT. The deposition of amyloid-\u03b2 (A-\u03b2) in animal brains could be induced by the consumption of a diet high in cholesterol [29] , whereas the accumulation of neuronal A-\u03b2 was increased in rabbits with hyperlipidemia [30] . Furthermore, reducing cholesterol concentrations using drugs [31] (e.g. 3 hydroxy-3methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors) led to a decreased risk of DAT. Additionally, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a gene relevant to DAT, was closely associated with lipid metabolism [32] , which could dual-directionally match the concentrations of cholesterol in lines with fish-related fats consumptions. In contrast, subjects with the ApoE-4 allele (indicating a higher risk of DAT) had high concentrations of cholesterol [33] . In contrast, subjects with the ApoE-2 allele (which might lower the risk of DAT) had relatively low concentrations of cholesterol [34] .\nAlthough a series of prospective studies reported correlations between a fish-oriented diet and the risk of DAT, the potential mechanisms behind these correlations were unclear. By following up 980 elderly subjects for 4 years, researchers demonstrated that the risk of DAT was highest in subjects carrying the ApoE-4 allele in the highest quartile of total fat consumption [35] . Another study found that the high consumption of saturated and trans unsaturated FAs was related to an increased risk of DAT regardless of the ApoE genotype [36] . In addition, the intake of fish-oriented fats was correlated with a reduced risk of DAT [37] . Nevertheless, no type of fat consumption was correlated with DAT or other types of dementia in a study performed in over 5000 subjects aged \u226555 years [38] . In summary, inconsistencies focusing on the consumption of a fish-oriented diet and the risk of cognitive decline were found, and specific recommendations could not be made based on the recent studies. However, a diet high in fish-related fats was correlated with a reduced risk of vascular disease, which might be of significance. Therefore, it might be sensible to take these potential benefits into account for the further management of cognitive decline."}, {"section_title": "Clinical implications", "text": "A fish-oriented diet could have additive benefits for subjects with DAT since there is a potential link between FDI and cognitive decline. However, several caveats in the evidence linking diet to cognitive declines were found in the current study. The first key point focuses on the improved demand for the quantification of nutrients. Most nutrients were measured using dietary questionnaires containing relative terms rather than any absolute measurements. In other words, more or less of a nutrient could be inferred to be linked with better or worse outcomes. However, the description of the actual quantities and intervals of nutrient consumption in relevant observational studies was insufficient to allow any specific inferences to be drawn. Moreover, the exposures were selected by the subjects (not the investigators), which might have contributed to a series of undetected confounders. The above confounding issues and potential bias might be largely resolved by specific trial design in RCTs, which are viewed as the ideal approach to study the effects of diet on disease risk. However, due to the long periods of preclinical DAT or other type of dementia, it is impossible for researchers to conduct trials based on primary prevention using diet. Furthermore, the development of DAT might be the results of a subjects' life-long exposures or timing of positive events starting in later life. However, the latency duration in subjects with DAT (i.e., the amount by which dietary interventions postponed or prevented disease progression) could be several decades, which is unclear based on recent evidence. Since studies assessing the correlation between diet and DAT were performed in the subjects aged > 65 years, a potential advanced phase involving the latency duration of DAT was seemingly observed in these aged groups. Consequently, evidence regarding the effects of dietary interventions on the course of different diseases is limited. Additionally, the different diets in included studies might affect the condition of the preclinical DAT, and the final exposure results also could be biased by preclinical cognitive-related conditions. Together, these factors likely led to incorrect interpretation or bias.\nAnother important consideration is the methodological formulation. Recently, most subjects have been diagnosed based on routine guidelines for dementia such as the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders fourth edition (DSM-IV). However, the detections of similar data did not always indicate qualified results. We increasingly considered the present guidelines do not guarantee consistency with the actual integrity of subjects' cognitive declines. Thus, the National Institutes of Mental Health has attempted to define some criteria for the provisional diagnosis of cognitive decline. In addition, dozens of scales have been formulated to evaluate the accompanying disorders in subjects with cognitive decline for the purpose of better estimating the effects of or tracing the progression of disease conditions. For the specific assessment of subjects with cognitive decline, the patterns of cognitive decline should be further updated using similar rating scores and structured interview approaches, especially due to the measurement of potential patients with severe cognitive damages using initial self-reported procedures. In clinical practice, symptoms could be underreported by patients or over-reported by caregivers, or biased reports could be caused by stress or other emotional factors regarding the subjects themselves. Therefore, clinical researchers should take some preventive measures to balance and evaluate the sources of information."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "This meta-analysis provides information regarding the association between FDI and the risk of cognitive decline.

Second, although measures were taken to control for underlying confounders in most of the included studies, some remaining confounders might still exist.
