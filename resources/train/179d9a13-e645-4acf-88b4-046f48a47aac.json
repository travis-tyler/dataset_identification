[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Several high-level committees have concluded that current domestic and global trends are threatening America's global science and engineering (S&E) preeminence. Of the challenges discussed, few are thought to be as serious as the purported decline in the supply of high quality students from the beginning to the end of the S&E pipeline-a decline brought about by declining emphasis on math and science education, coupled with a supposed declining interest among domestic students in S&E careers. However, our review of the data fails to find support for those presumptions. Rather, the available data indicate increases in the absolute numbers of secondary school graduates and increases in their math and science performance levels. Domestic and international trends suggest that that U.S. schools show steady improvement in math and science, the U.S. is not at any particular disadvantage compared with most nations, and the supply of S&E-qualified graduates is large and ranks among the best internationally. Further, the number of undergraduates completing S&E studies has grown, and the number of S&E graduates remains high by historical standards. Why, then, is there a purported failure to meet the demand for S&E college students and S&E workers? Analysis of the flow of students up through the S&E pipeline, when it reaches the labor market, suggests the education system produces qualified graduates far in excess of demand: S&E occupations make up only about one-twentieth of all workers, and each year there are more than three times as many S&E four-year college graduates as S&E job openings. So it is not clear, even if there were deficiencies in students' average S&E performance, that such deficiencies would necessarily be insufficient to meet the requisite S&E demand. While improving average math and science education at the K-12 level may be warranted for other reasons, such a strategy may not be the most efficient means of supplying the S&E workforce. Workforce development and education policy requires a more thorough analysis than appears to be guiding current policy reports. The available evidence points, first, to a need for targeted education policy, to focus on the populations in the lower portion of the performance distribution. Second, the seemingly more-than-adequate supply of qualified college graduates suggests a need for better understanding why the \"demand side\" fails to induce more graduates into the S&E workforce. Third, public and private investment should be balanced between domestic development of S&E workforce supply and global collaboration as a longer-term goal. Policy approaches to human capital development and employment from prior eras do not address the current workforce or economic policy needs."}, {"section_title": "Into the Eye of the Storm: Assessing the Evidence on Science and Engineering Education, Quality, and Workforce Demand", "text": "Policymakers and industry leaders are once again concerned about the adequacy of the science and engineering (S&E) workforce. A growing number of reports claim that a lack of sufficient numbers of scientists and engineers entering the workforce is threatening the United States' economic health and dominant position in global innovation. The primary causes of an impending workforce shortage, it is argued, are the mediocre preparation of domestic students in the educational pipeline and an ongoing decline in their interest in pursuing S&E careers. To address the assumed crisis, the consensus recommendation of business groups, public policymakers, and educators is to expand and improve science and math education from kindergarten through college, and to more aggressively court foreign S&E students and workers. This paper examines the assumptions about the state of the educational pipeline and the purported workforce shortages. Despite this nearly universal support for upgrading science and math education, our review of the data leads us to conclude that, while the educational pipeline would benefit from improvements, it is not as dysfunctional as believed. Today's American high school students actually test as well or better than students two decades ago. Further, today's students take more science and math classes, and a large number of students with strong science and math backgrounds graduate from U.S. high schools and start college in S&E fields of study. Graduate schools have an ample pool of qualified four-year graduates to draw from but seem unable or unwilling to do so. Surprisingly few of the many students who start along the path toward S&E careers take the next steps to remain in an S&E career. If there is a problem, it is not one of too few S&E qualified college graduates but, rather, the inability of S&E firms to attract qualified graduates. The pool of graduates with an S&E degree exceeds the number of S&E job openings each year, even though employers may not be as successful as they would like in attracting or retaining graduates into an S&E career. The various policy reports focusing on increasing the science and math preparation at the K-12 level almost uniformly fail to ask the question our analysis suggests-has the increase in the absolute numbers of secondary school graduates and the increase in their math and science performance levels provided an adequate number of domestic S&E college majors? The pool of S&E-qualified secondary and postsecondary graduates is several times larger than the number of annual job openings. The flow of secondary school students up through the S&E pipeline, when it reaches the labor market, supplies occupations that make up only about a twentieth of all workers. So even if there were deficiencies in students' average science and math performance, such deficiencies would not necessarily deplete the requisite supply of S&E college majors. Even if modal test scores or course-taking was by some measure low, the size of the graduating student body is so large that there would still be a sufficient number of students who test above average and who are fully qualified for the relatively small number of S&E jobs. While improving average math and science education at the K-12 level may be warranted for other reasons, such a strategy may not be the most efficient means of supplying the S&E workforce. Our analysis at the aggregate level does not find a shortage of potential S&E students or workers. However, this conclusion is put forth with one caveat: the analysis of all S&E students and workers may not apply equally to the trends and problems faced in specific fields or by domestic minority groups. A fine-grained analysis of specific industries, occupations, and populations is needed to identify the weakness in the U.S. education system. We are, indeed, conducting this level of analysis for future reports. The S&E world includes a broad range of knowledge, types of related jobs, and a great diversity of students and workers with academic performance and employment trends different from the overall averages. A better understanding of S&E workforce demand and education and workforce development will identify areas where public and private policy could be most effectively targeted. This paper begins with a look at U.S. high school students and the data on domestic S&E coursetaking and tests of performance, and then it examines how U.S. students compare on international tests of S&E performance. Our intent is to trace students along the pipeline or the \"pathways\" from school to work. In the next section of the paper, we examine data on reported interest in an S&E studies by college entrants and the subsequent graduation of S&E degreeholders. The following section examines the relative size of the graduating class, as well as the relative size of S&E employment growth. There are transition points along S&E pathways and we wish to estimate the proportion of students at each transition point who continue on to the next S&E point in the pathway. For example, where does the purported shortfall of native S&E supply take place: at high school, college, or at entry into the labor market? How much has the proportion of S&E graduates pursing an S&E career changed? In the final section of the paper, we note that employer reports of hiring problems should not be taken as prima fascia evidence of labor market shortages. Moreover, education and immigration policies that are based on that assumption can undermine future economic and labor-market strength. We consider these often overlooked, negative long-term consequences of implementing well-meaning but misguided policies."}, {"section_title": "Concerns with the Educational Pipeline", "text": "The conclusions several high-level committees have reached within the past few years reinforce the perception that domestic and global trends challenge America's global S&E preeminence. Of the various challenges discussed, few are thought to be as serious as the purported decline in the supply of high-quality students from the beginning to the end of the S&E pipeline. It is concluded that the combination of the educational weaknesses in domestic supply, along with growing S&E capacity abroad, has reached a dangerous and threatening stage: The future well-being of our nation and people depends not just on how well we educate our children generally, but on how well we educate them in mathematics and science specifically.\u2026 Our children are falling behind; they are simply not \"world-class learners\" when it comes to mathematics and science. (The National Commission on Mathematics and Science Teaching for the 21st Century 2000) If trends in U.S. research and education continue, our nation will squander its economic leadership, and the result will be a lower standard of living for the American people\u2026. By 2015 [the country needs to] double the number of bachelor's degrees awarded annually to U.S. students in science, math, and engineering. (National Summit on Competitiveness 2005) The United States faces an unprecedented challenge to its long-term global economic leadership. And a fall from leadership would threaten the security of the nation and the prosperity of its citizens.\u2026 High school students in the U.S. perform well below those in other industrialized nations in the fields of mathematics and science \u2026 [and thus we need to make] STEM education a national priority. (Council on Competitiveness 2004) The committee is deeply concerned that the scientific and technological building blocks critical to our economic leadership are eroding at a time when many other nations are gathering strength \u2026 we fear the abruptness with which a lead in science and technology can be lost\u2026. (National Academies of Science 2006) Reviewing the various reports, and in light of the data on science and math preparation, we identify three major concerns in the reports on weaknesses in U.S. students' science, math, and technology preparation. First, it is argued that the low levels of skills and math and science proficiency of U.S. students lead to an inadequate supply of college students and college graduates for the science and engineering workforces. Second, it is further argued that U.S. students' math and science proficiencies are lower than those of students around the globe. Other nations are improving and expanding their science, math, and engineering education at higher rates than the United States, putting the United States at a competitive disadvantage. The reports forcefully argue that addressing an educational deficit of U.S. high school students is necessary to maintain a competitive advantage. Presumably, the fact that high school students elsewhere perform better also translates into, or at least is correlated with, the growing production of S&E workers in the rising economic powers China and India. 1 Third, it is argued that any improvement in the math and science achievement of U.S. students is not occurring fast enough. Internationally, the rapid expansion of education systems in the emerging economies is presumed to be producing students with achievement levels improving at 1 The proportion of immigrants, who presumably come from countries with stronger science education, has grown in U.S. colleges and in the S&E workforce. These increases are taken to mean that demand has outstripped the supply of adequately trained domestic students. For example, the Business Roundtable concludes that in the face of the declining interest and proficiency by Americans in science, math and engineering, American industry has become increasingly dependent-some would say overly dependent-on foreign nationals to fill the demand for talent in a variety of fields that require strong backgrounds in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. (Business Roundtable 2003) We will not address this latter concern in depth, but suffice it to say that the competition for S&E students is growing worldwide, the potential supply from abroad remains strong, and it is unclear that the United States must retain the greatest share of the global student body to remain competitive. More to the point, the United States will retain the lion's share of the global student body under almost any future scenario, and it is unclear that a race to retain a numerical majority will ensure that the United States retains the best and the brightest students. a rate outpacing that of U.S. students. Domestically, many argue that improvements are not occurring fast enough to close the achievement gaps between different demographic groups. This means primarily that many women, Latinos, and African Americans are disadvantaged in competing for good jobs. In combination, these presumed deficiencies in U.S. education are viewed as major shortcomings in the future \"competitiveness,\" innovation, and economic performance capabilities of the United States. In the following sections, we review the evidence on educational quality and then analyze the actual supply of science, math, and engineering students and graduates."}, {"section_title": "High School Performance: Bad and Getting Worse?", "text": "We begin by examining the evidence supporting the common assertions that the United States has long been failing in S&E education and that its students perform abysmally when compared to international norms. These assertions rest heavily on several widely cited \"facts\" that are at the least ambiguous and, when examined a little more closely, appear incorrect. The reports cite well-known national and international data sources purported to demonstrate three deficiencies in our system: (a) inadequate and declining math and science preparation: the number of courses taken are few and test scores have been declining over the past 20 to 30 years; (b) poor performance on international tests: U.S. students have lower levels of math and science knowledge when compared to those in many other countries; and (c) the inferior structure and content of U.S. education: the overall K-12 educational curriculum and the preparation of its teachers are of lower quality than in other countries."}, {"section_title": "Science and Math Coursetaking and Test Performance", "text": "The first assertion in the reports is that education levels have been in decline overall and that U.S. students are not doing well in math and science in particular. The supporting data, when provided, are of the percentages of low-performing students supplemented with employer testimony about poorly prepared applicants. Although the proportion of poorly performing students is an important concern about the education system, and one we address later in this paper, the relevant indicator of science and engineering supply is the performance and size of the population that is qualified for the science and engineering workforce. The proportion of students who at least finish a high school degree has increased notably over the past 30 years. There is some debate over the precise rate of completion and the appropriate measure to use, but the most widely accepted \"status completion\" rate for 18-to 24-year-olds compiled by the National Center for Educational Statistics was 83 percent in 1972 and increased to 87 percent by 2004. The different methods result in completion rates that vary, but the trends are similar, showing significant increase in completion rates over the past 20 to 30 years, with slow to marginal increases more recently. 2 Although the high school completion rate is lower for certain groups, there has been steady improvement in high school completion for every demographic group. At the same time, more students are staying in school and more of the student population is \"on track,\" defined as enrolled at the modal grade level for their age. Between 1994 and 2003, there was a 6 percentage point increase to 75 percent of 12-to 17-yearolds who were academically \"on track\" (Dye and Johnson 2006). High school students' exposure to science and math has increased over time. In 1982, high school graduates earned 2.6 math credits and 2.2 science credits on average. By 1998, the average number of credits increased to 3.5 math and 3.2 science credits. Further, the share of students who take algebra early increased from 1986 to 1999. The percentage of 13-year-olds enrolled in algebra and in prealgebra rose 38 and 78 percent, to 22 and 34 percent from 16 and 19 percent, respectively (NCES 2001a). Students from all racial/ethnic groups, and both male and female students, significantly increased science and math course-taking, albeit differential achievement rates between groups remain. Table 1 shows the trends from 1990 to 2000. 2 Cited here are the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) data that are from the annual dropout report based on self-reported high school completion in the Current Population Survey. White non-Hispanics complete at 92 percent and blacks at 83 percent. Today, the lowest rate is for Hispanic immigrants with a completion rate of 55 percent and the next lowest is for native-born Hispanics at 81 percent. A more narrowly defined status completion rate for 17-to 19-year-olds reduces the impact of nativity and improves the completion rates of foreign-born adults (because so many non-high school completers immigrate in their early twenties, increased rates of immigrants with less than a high school education may lead to lower graduation rate percentages in some estimates that use total post-high school population). These data include GED degrees which may make up as much as a seventh of those who report high school completion, and the data on GED are not reliable. Nevertheless, we prefer, along with most analysts, these traditional indicators of high school completion, but we are aware of lower rates based on a measure    1973 1978 1986 1990 1994 1999 2004 13 year olds 17-year-olds higher achievement levels, take more courses, and enter some S&E fields in greater numbers than men (NCES 2001a). 3 The well known Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT) also show an increase in scores over the past three decades (College Board 2006). Figure 2 shows, as SAT followers know, a dip in math scores occurred during the 1970s through the mid-1980s, but there has been a steady increase since that time. The SAT math scores increased sharply between 1996 and 2006 from a score of 508 to 518 (adjusted for the break in standardization during the period). Furthermore, the gap in female and male math scores has closed from about 40 points at the outset of the 1980s to 30 points today. In the past year, there has been a slight, though statistically insignificant, decline of 1 to 3 points. However, there were also more students and more diverse groups of students taking this test, which, it is suggested, is the likely cause of the decline; compared with the past, test takers are more diverse in terms of demographics and academic performance (e.g., in some states, all high school seniors were required to take the test). 4 As the president of the College 3 For detail on math and science course taking and achievement over the past 20 to 30 years, NSF provides the most comprehensive review. The following summary of the research comes from the NSF Science and Engineering Indicators 2004: \"The NAEP trend assessment shows that student performance in mathematics improved overall from 1973 to 1999 for 9-, 13-, and 17-year-olds\u2026. In general, the average performance of both males and females in mathematics improved from the early 1970s to the late 1990s, including the period from 1990 to 1999. In 1982, high school graduates earned an average of 2.6 mathematics credits and 2.2 science credits. By 1998, those numbers grew to 3.5 and 3.2 credits, respectively (NCES 2001a). This expansion of academic course taking included all racial/ethnic groups and both male and female students\u2026. NAEP data indicate that the proportion of students who take algebra early increased between 1986 and 1999 \u2026  -1970s]. Degrees awarded to underrepresented minorities rose from 9 to 16 percent, and those awarded to Asian/Pacific Islanders increased from 2 to 9 percent.\" 4 The test taking group now includes more students who traditionally have lower academic performance. For example: \"In all, 35 percent of the class taking the SAT would be the first in their family to attend college, mirroring the broad diversification of the college student population that university officials have been noting and encouraging in recent years\u2026 For example, the average score for students who planned to apply for financial aid in college was 501 in critical reading and 508 in math; the average scores for students who did not intend to apply for aid was 530 in critical reading and 548 in math. The average scores for students whose parents did not graduate from Board, which administers the SAT, explained, \"The larger the population you get that takes the exam, it obviously knocks down the scores\" (Finder 2007;College Board 2007). The other college entrance exam, the ACT, which is taken by only a slightly smaller number of students (in 2007, 1.3 million took the ACT, compared with 1.5 million who took the SAT), shows steadily increasing achievement levels among students through the late 1990s, a decline between 2002 and 2005, and then a steep increase in 2006 and continuing to reach a tenyear high in 2007. This occurred with a steady increase in the numbers of students taking the ACT over this period. Additionally, one international test provides additional evidence that there was no decline in U.S. student achievement over the 1990s. The TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study), which is administered to third and eighth graders in up to 46 countries, is frequently cited as evidence of poor performance by U.S. students relative to students in other nations (we return to this issue below). Yet, the TIMSS, which has been administered to third and eighth graders in 1995, 1999, and 2003 (with a 2006/2007 wave not yet reported) also finds that, looking just at the scores of U.S. students, there has been no decline and even some improvement over this period (Gonzales 2004). Across all U.S. race, gender, and income groups, there was either no change or there was improvement over the three waves of the TIMSS for eighth graders and small variations for fourth graders. In many cases, gaps between race and high school was 421 in critical reading and 445 in math; the comparable averages for students whose parents are  1972 1974 1976 1978 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 Source: College Board, 2006 (www.collegeboard.com) gender groups narrowed. No consistent, notable declines were found in detailed analyses of the survey results. The weight of the evidence, when considering all the different measures, surely indicates no decline but rather indicates an ongoing educational improvement for U.S. students. This improvement is not only in math and science but in all subjects tested and, importantly, occurs at the same time as a greater and more diverse proportion of the population is remaining in school. 5 But there is another arrow in the critics' quiver: there is a global race afoot and the United States is losing pace so that it matters not if domestic trends are improving because U.S. students, relatively speaking, do not perform as well as students in other nations. We turn now to that issue."}, {"section_title": "Strong Showings on International Tests", "text": "The second claim is that U.S. economic and innovative capacity is imperiled by the relatively low performance of U.S. students compared with students in other countries. The test results cited as support of this claim range from the failure of the United States to be number one to an apparent decline from fourth grade rankings, which are relatively strong, to twelfth grade rankings, which are at or near the bottom of the list. However, although cross-national tests are valuable when used for carefully defined purposes, almost all of these tests do not support the conclusions often drawn about national \"rankings\" of student performance."}, {"section_title": "Global Rankings and the TIMSS.", "text": "The most widely cited study, noted above, is the TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study). The test has been administered to third and eighth graders and, in addition, in 1995 and 1999 the test was administered to twelfth graders. In the fourth and eighth grade math and science tests over the 1995 to 2003 period, the U.S. performs above the international average, with rank-orders between fifth and twelfth depending upon the year, the grade (fourth or eighth), and the test (math or science). The twelfth college graduates was 522 and 533.\" (Finder, 2007) 5 A reasonable inference is that lower performing and harder-to-serve students were disproportionately dropouts. Thus, achieving stable or improved high school test performance in a student population that includes more of these students, not formerly taking the tests as 17-year-olds, may understate the actual levels of improvement. grade test administered just in 1995 and 1999 has been widely criticized as sampling very different populations in each country (in some cases including cohorts that cover a three year age range and disparate course taking) and neither the TIMSS nor other international tests currently test this age or grade group. The notion that the United States trails the world in educational performance misrepresents the actual test results and reaches conclusions that are quite unfounded. The test rankings and conclusions about the global standing of the United States and its education system typically fail to consider the membership of the global comparison group, the composition of the leading groups, the actual and meaningful differences in ranking, rankings on subjects other than math and science, American exceptionalism in its comparative heterogeneity, the extent of the \"gap\" between the groups, and the relationship between the tests and assumed outcomes of economic performance. Typically the list purporting to rank performance outcomes fails to note statistically significant differences and the extent of test score difference: many differences in scores are small and are not statistically significant in some cases. For example, there is no statistical difference between the \"fifth ranked\" United States in 2003 and the nations ranked third and fourth. 6 Moreover, the list of countries participating does not include Brazil, China (mainland), Germany, France, India, or Mexico, among other economically important and populous nations. Although the United States does not lead the list in any particular year or grade in math and science (it does in other subjects), the United States is one of the few nations that does consistently perform above the international average. For the most part, the top-ranked group of nations has few constant members, particularly among non-Asian countries. Depending on the test (subject and grade level), that top group changes membership, with the exception of Singapore, which remained at or near the top and scored significantly higher in nearly all science and math tests. For example, the United States is just behind Hungary in eighth-grade science scores. Yet, Hungary had a statistically significant decline in performance between 1999 and 2003, while the United States had a larger and statistically significant improvement in performance over the same period. The U.S. ranks lower than Flemish Belgium in eighth-grade math in 2003, but Flemish Belgium is in the bottom-ranked group in eighth-grade science, trailing far behind the United States. Indeed, there is little consistency in performance or ranking among the leading, non-Asian nations. Overall, the science and math leaders are the five Asian countries of Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong SAR, Japan, Korea, and Singapore, which often, though not always, outperform the United States and all the other countries participating in the testing. 7 But even so, the significance of this \"lead\" requires more examination to assess the state of the education system and student achievement. We need to look at changes over time, population differences, and the relationship between performance on these tests and other outcomes of interest. The TIMSS also follows the performance of comparable cohorts within each country from one test period to the next. The The \"world\" that the United States trails is a haphazard collection of mostly small nations and devoid of consistent leaders with a few exceptions. Rather than concluding that the United States statistically significantly higher scores (Hong Kong and England's scores are not \"measurably different from the U.S. average\") (Gonzales 2004). 7 For example, an analysis of G-8 country performance on the TIMSS (Miller et al. 2007) notes that \"The percentages of fourth-grade students at or above the high achievement benchmark in science ranged from 27 percent in Scotland to 49 percent in Japan. In the United States, 45 percent of students reached the high benchmark in science The percentages of students meeting the advanced benchmark in science ranged from 5 percent in Scotland to 15 percent in England (with Japan at 12 percent). In the United States, 13 percent of fourth-graders reached the advanced benchmark. Thus, whereas higher percentages of students in Japan than in the other G-8 countries reached each benchmark in mathematics, this was not a consistent finding in science.\" This is another illustration of the shortcomings of single test/grade/year rankings rather than an analysis of consistent patterns and the need to analyze the overall results and patterns rather than selected rankings. is behind the world, it would be more accurate to conclude that the test results show the United States is not the highest performing nation in any single science or math test, but it is one of a very few nations that consistently rank above the international average in tests of academic performance. And the United States is one of the few that show consistent improvement over time and across grades and subjects. What is more, although science and math are the primary focus of policy discussion, in other areas, such as literacy, U.S. scores are consistently above the international averages. By excluding those tests from international comparisons, it is implied that literacy does not hold the same importance as science and math, usually by reference to science and math as the drivers of innovation and economic growth. However, there is no substantial evidence to support the assertion that a nation's average levels of math and science mastery lead to a disproportionate share of innovation or economic growth. Moreover, employers report that literacy and a competence in a broad range of subjects are essential. Finally, and despite the fact that many observers do so, it is not meaningful to draw international comparisons for the TIMSS results for high school students (often referred to as the \"12th grade\" test). The test is administered to students identified in each nation to be in their final year of secondary education. This is problematic because that final year of secondary school varies widely across nations from three years up to almost eight years beyond eighth grade. In other words, students completing secondary education in many other nations often have received more years of education than U.S. students. And there is a strong correlation between years of schooling beyond eighth grade and the test scores of secondary students (Boe and Shin 2005). Should we be surprised if students who have received more coursework perform better on the same test? Consider that a completed secondary education in many European nations is often thought to be equivalent to a freshman year in an American college; hence, the ability of Europeans to move toward a three-year bachelor's degree. The twelfth grade TIMSS may reflect differences in sequencing of courses rather than performance levels of students who have studied the same subject matter. Consequently, the TIMSS has limited value in comparing the relative performance of secondary students because the sampled students do not have equivalent secondary education."}, {"section_title": "Global Rankings and the PISA. The second international test is the Programme for", "text": "International Student Assessment (PISA), which focuses on assessing more \"real life\" or applied knowledge than the TIMSS and tests 15-year-olds in the OECD countries and a number of non-OECD, partner countries. The PISA was administered in 2000, 2003 and 2006. It differs from the TIMSS in a number of important ways. First, PISA attempts to test the overall level of knowledge and the ability to apply that knowledge in mathematics, science, and reading rather than TIMSS's goal of attempting to measure performance based directly on school curriculum. Second, the PISA includes all the OECD countries, many of which were not in the various TIMSS surveys (for example, countries not in the 1999 wave of TIMSS that are in the PISA include Germany, France, Switzerland, Austria, Spain, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland). Third, the sample is age-based rather than grade-based, selecting all 15-year-olds rather than students in one grade. PISA, like the TIMSS, is widely cited as a test purporting to evaluate the math and science performance of students in each country relative to those of other countries and to reflect the effectiveness of each country's education system. It is often cited in U.S. policy reports as supposedly showing U.S. students lagging the performance of most other countries. Yet, using the PISA results in this manner, as reflecting the comparative performance of the U.S. education system or its students, stretches the PISA far beyond its appropriate or even intended use. The most common interpretation of the PISA results is that it shows U.S. schools are deficient compared with those in other countries. However, the PISA researchers state quite clearly that these results may indicate something quite different altogether; based on differences in scores between countries: It cannot automatically be inferred that the schools or particular parts of the education system in the first country are more effective than those in the second. However, one can legitimately conclude that the cumulative impact of learning experiences in the first country, starting in early childhood and up to the age of 15 and embracing experiences both in school and at home, have resulted in higher outcomes in the literacy domains that PISA measures. (Adams 2003, 381) Further, PISA is not an assessment of what young people learned during their previous year at school, or even during their secondary school years. It is an indication of the learning development that has occurred since birth. Improving quality and equity therefore require a long-term view and a broad perspective. For some countries, this may mean taking measures to safeguard the healthy development of young children, or improving early childhood education. For others, it may mean socioeconomic reforms that enable families to provide better care for the children. But in many, it can mean efforts to increase socio-economic inclusion and improve school offerings. (OECD 2003b, 195) The PISA is, by design, not an evaluation of a country's school system but rather a reflection of a number of factors, many and perhaps most importantly, non-school achievement factors. It is notable that this central conclusion by the PISA researchers finds little mention in most policy reports that, instead, focus quite narrowly on math and science education. We discuss these conclusions and implications for policy below. There are, at the same time, a number of other factors about the PISA that preclude the use of international rankings as typically reported. We note a few of these issues here, but much more detailed critiques have been done by others (e.g., Hull 2007;Prais 2003). 9 The U.S. sample response rate did not initially meet the required minimum PISA established and thus a \"replacement sample\" was used to supplement the initial sample. However, some experts argue this replacement sampling technique was not adequate (Prais 2003) and even by PISA standards, the U.S. sample was marginal. 10 Perhaps as a consequence, for the United States, some of the changes between the 2000 and 2003 tests appear to reflect sampling error rather than actual changes over time. 11 According to Prais (2003), different countries used different sampling criteria, with some countries excluding special needs students (in one German sample, excluding special needs students was found to make a difference of 8 points in the average score). The PISA researchers note that using age rather than grade to sample students involves a tradeoff as the range of grades tested varied quite significantly by country. However, not all countries used age-based sampling though the impact of the different sampling frames is not discussed. 12 Differences in some cases are quite large: Japan, for example, has 100 percent of its sampled students in the 10th grade, Korea and Norway have over 98 percent in the 10th grade, whereas the United States has only 61 percent in the 10th grade and a third of the sampled students in the 9th grade or lower. The impact of the proportion of the sample in 10th grade is not inconsequential: \"the difference between students in the two grades implies that one school year corresponds to an average of 41 score points on the PISA mathematics scale\" (OECD 2004, 60). How, then, does one compare the United States' mean score of 483 with Japan's mean score of 534, Korea's score of 542, or Norway's score of 495? Using a standard test across all countries is a difficult undertaking and, predictably, differences in context would be expected to account for some of the differences in test scores. For example, the mathematics problems were all done in metric units; it would be reasonable to assume that students who live in countries using the metric system might have some advantage over those in countries that do not use the metric system as their measurement standard. (Some balancing of cultural context was attempted by having questions from research teams in different countries, but none were submitted by the U.S. team.) These limitations of the PISA for drawing certain types of comparisons and conclusions are discussed by the PISA researchers. They are quite explicit about what they consider the appropriate interpretation of the test results: As a result of this population definition, PISA makes statements about the knowledge and skills of a group of individuals who were born within a comparable reference period, but who may have undergone different educational experiences both within and outside schools. In PISA, these knowledge and skills are referred to as the yield of education at an age that is common across countries. Depending on countries' policies on school entry and promotion, these students may be distributed over a narrower or a wider range of grades. Furthermore, in some countries, students in PISA's target population are split between different education systems, tracks or streams. If a country's scale scores in reading, scientific or mathematical literacy are significantly higher than those in another country, it cannot automatically be inferred that the schools or particular parts of the education system in the first country are more effective than those in the second. However, one can legitimately conclude that the cumulative impact of learning experiences in the first country, starting in early childhood and up to the age of 15 and embracing experiences both in school and at home, have resulted in higher outcomes in the literacy domains that PISA measures. (OECD 2004, 320;emphasis added) We now turn to the interpretation and implications of international differences in test scores. industrialized nations and consider the statistical significance of the original data when ranking nations. They conclude that U.S. students have generally performed above average in comparisons with students in other industrialized nations. Certainly there is variability in performance, with the U.S. scoring above average in reading and civics, average in science, and somewhat below average in mathematics. But even in mathematics at the middle and secondary levels, the U.S. did not perform \"poorly.\" (Boe and Shin 2005, 694) Their classification collapses minute testing score differences, and they develop national groupings according to whether or not their students test the same as U.S. students, better or worse. Figure 3 shows their combined ranking on math, science, reading and civics. Only about one fifth of other industrial nations have average scores better than those of the United States, while roughly four tenths of the nations have average scores the same as those of the United States, and another four tenths score worse. Again, U.S. students, on average, are not the top scorers in science (25 percent of other nations did better) or in math (44 percent of other nations did better). But U.S. students rank highly on reading (only 13 percent of other nations have average scores that rank higher); and U.S. students rank with the highest nations on civics scores (no other nation ranks better). In short, the United States scores near the top among large industrial nations on three out of four fields of knowledge and, while the average math scores do not place the United States above the group average, the report card is not as dismal as it is often portrayed. 13 Boe and Shin conclude that the global divide is between the western industrialized nations and the rising Asian nations on math and science test performance, though not in other areas. When comparing U.S. student performance to the G7 Nations, the average U.S. test score is comparable to the other western nations, all of which trail Japan in mathematics and science. So it is not the case that U.S. students are markedly different from students in major European nations, but rather that students in Japan and some other Asian nations, on average, perform consistently well on these math and science tests. Interpreting the meaning of differences in scores is discussed by the PISA researchers and others, though their analysis is rarely considered by the policymakers and others citing the rankings. combined OECD countries, the \"performance gap\" averaged across all six questions, and the scale scores (see Lemke et al. 2004, 7-12 for the test questions). for representing a population distribution but they do not necessarily provide any insight into the importance of the differences, and seldom is the magnitude of the score differences analyzed."}, {"section_title": "U.S. Students' Performance on International", "text": "The question is not about whether to improve the U.S. education system, which is of course a worthy goal, but rather why U.S. performance is lower than other countries, what the implications are for \"competitiveness,\" and what policies would best address the deficiencies. For this, we need to further examine the reasons for the differences in test scores between nations. Many researchers note the role of non-school achievement factors found to be strongly associated with educational performance levels. The PISA researchers examine these differences within and between nations and find that, for most countries, these factors account for a large proportion of performance differences. The impact on test scores of single-parent families, for which the U.S. rate is two to three times the rate in the countries that have the highest test scores, is strikingly large. \"Even when controlling for the influence of other socioeconomic factors, an average gap of 18 scale points remains between students from single-parent and other types of families. This gap is between 25 and 30 score points in Belgium, Ireland, and the United States\" (OECD 2004, 167). Analysis of the PISA results and socioeconomic factors shows that in some countries schools appear to offset the negative impacts to a much greater extent than in other countries. The United States is one of six OECD countries where socioeconomic level has a strong impact on student performance, where the average score will be more affected by the size of the low socioeconomic population, or, conversely, where schools are least effective in providing an education that improves the test performance of students from low socioeconomic, immigrant, and/or single-parent families (OECD 2004, 182). The PISA researchers repeatedly state, as quoted above, that one cannot use the test results as indicative of differences in the education systems of countries. First, of the overall variation in student performance, only 10 percent is due to differences between countries. \"Nine-tenths of the student performance variation in PISA is within countries\" (OECD 2004, 116; emphasis in the original). As noted above, it is the overall impact of achievement related factors that affect performance and many of these are nonschool factors. An analysis of these nonschool factors shows the United States to be quite different from the countries whose students perform higher than those in the United States. with 17 percent in Norway (a country with comparatively high levels of social benefits and services) and less than 10 percent in Japan, Singapore, and Korea. Almost all of the population of Japan, 99 percent, speaks Japanese as their first language, compared with the 18 percent of the U.S. population that lives in a household in which a language other than English is spoken. Along these lines, consider that Norway, one of the top-scoring western nations, has a small population of 4.5 million with an immigrant population of just 7 percent, of which 44 percent is European (with relatively similar social and cultural conditions and background). Although Canada has a foreign-born population of 18 percent compared with 11 percent of the U.S. population, Canada has a much more restrictive immigration policy, effectively limiting immigration to high-skilled workers, those establishing a business, and family members of those already in Canada. (Canada is one of the few countries in which natives do not significantly outperform immigrants [OECD 2004, 167].) The United States has a large population and the most diverse demographics of any One could argue that it is the diversity and openness of the United States that both contribute to its high economic performance and its lower average educational performance. The benefits that diversity brings America are accompanied by the challenges of sizeable minority and immigrant populations that do not perform as well as the white majority. The often broad chasm that divides the educational performance of majority and minority students is partly due to differences in such characteristics as language and family formation, but also has much to do with differences in the quality of educational systems and household income. New immigrants often come with a weak education from their home country and have the highest school dropout rates once in the "}, {"section_title": "The Pipeline from High School to Work: Inadequate Supply?", "text": "Having completed the high school portion of the pipeline, the challenge at the college level is to attract students to enter an S&E major and to retain those who enter as S&E majors through graduation.

Then having traced the pipeline as far as college, we follow it further to graduation. We focus here on the aggregate level and all S&E degrees in order to evaluate the broad based assertion that all S&E output is in decline. 14"}, {"section_title": "Undergraduates Show Stable Interest in S&E Majors", "text": "The first claim about college students is that fewer are interested in pursuing an S&E degree.

Despite these common assertions, the data do not suggest a notable decline in student interest in S&E college education. 15 A survey of the entering freshman class asks about their college interests and finds remarkable continuity in students' desires to pursue an S&E major. In 1983, about 35 percent of all entering college freshman expressed an interest in pursuing an S&E major and, two decades later, in 2004, 33 percent of the entering class was interested in an S&E major (NSF 2006). Over these two decades, there were some changes in intentions by demographic group.

Moreover, the proportion of all bachelor's degrees awarded in S&E has been relatively stable over time, as has the proportion of freshman in an S&E major. Figure 4 shows that not quite a third of American undergraduates finish an S&E degree, a proportion that has been fairly consistent for over two decades. These data are restricted to citizens and permanent residents, whom we refer to as \"domestic\" students, so they are not influenced by the growing number of foreign students enrolled in U.S. institutions. The story for S&E master's and doctoral degrees is also primarily one of consistency in the proportion of all degrees awarded over the past two decades. About one-fifth of all master's degree graduates obtained their degrees in an S&E field.

Because the proportion of students pursuing an S&E degree has remained stable while the number (or proportion) of students pursuing a college degree has increased, more graduates earn an S&E degree. Figure 5 shows that the number of S&E bachelor's degrees earned by citizens and permanent residents has continued to grow smartly at the same time there are growing concerns that fewer Americans are pursing S&E degrees. The number of master's degrees grew steeply through 1995 and has been more or less stable since then. However, the number of doctorates earned by citizens and permanent residents appears to have declined a little from the early 1990s through 2002; the number of doctorates grew to a peak of about 32,000 in 1995 only to decline to about 27,500 in 2002. More recent data just for doctorates suggest supplies of the numbers of citizens and permanent have stabilized at around 28,000 through 2004. 16 From the start of the late 1970s through today, a fairly stable share of college freshman report intending to pursue an S&E degree and a fairly stable proportion graduate with S&E majors. There has been no decline in interest by these measures. At the same time, there has been growth in the number of undergraduates completing their S&E studies, while the number of S&E graduates remains high by historical standards. As to the future, the growth of the college-age U.S. population is slowing and growth in the number of youth of college age is slowing as well. Yet, the proportion of students pursuing a college degree has been increasing and that may somewhat offset the declining population base. Today, about 35 percent of young whites and about 55 percent of Asians complete a four-year college education, though only about 20 percent of young blacks and about 10 percent of young Hispanics complete college (U.S. Census Bureau 2007, table 2). How then can we square the argument that there has been, and will be, widespread shortages of workers to supply the S&E labor market?"}, {"section_title": "Students and Jobs: A Missing Link in the Debate?", "text": "The critics assert, or implicitly assume, that the educational pipeline provides an inadequate supply of domestic students to work in the S&E labor force. Consequently, the rationale for increasing the quantity and quality of K-12 science and math is to increase the flow of S&E qualified students into the college segment of the pipeline, which, in turn, is assumed to produce To begin, we would like to know whether the production of domestic S&E college students is anywhere near the apparent demand for S&E workers. We want to get some idea of how many graduates there are relative to S&E jobs (occupations) and so we engage here in a rough and ready exercise. The purpose is simply to get an idea of \"order of magnitude\" and not to engage in false precision. The overall S&E workforce totals about 4.8 million, which is less than a third of the 15.7 million workers who hold at least one S&E degree. The S&E employment of S&E graduates is also a fairly consistent one-third of S&E graduates each year. 17 Past employment growth follows this same pattern. From 1985 to 2000, the U.S. graduated about 435,000 S&E students annually with bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees-that total includes only domestic citizens and permanent residents (about 72 percent of S&E workers hold bachelor's, 20 percent a master's, and 7 percent a doctorate degree). Over the same time period, net change in S&E occupational employment ran about 150,000 annually, such that the average ratio of all S&E graduates to net employment change was about three to one. 18 Of course, net employment growth is not a direct measure of employment demand or total job openings, since net growth does not include replacement for retirements or occupational quits, nor do these aggregate numbers indicate the types of workers sought (education level, students. Over 80 percent of temporary foreign students earn doctorates in an S&E field of study. See NSF, \"S&E Doctorates Hit All-time High in 2005\" [NSF 07-301] at http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/doctorates/. 17 In this exercise, we are examining the S&E occupational employment of S&E graduates while recognizing that S&E education into S&E employment is only one labor market linkage: an S&E education could be valuable in non-S&E occupations, such as a patent lawyer, and many S&E jobs are helped by non-S&E graduates (e.g., as much as 40 percent of the IT workforce does not have a four-year degree). We will be conducting more detailed analyses of the education to employment flows, but here we wish to provide some broad indicators of supply and demand. In addition, typically cited are employer complaints about supposed shortages for S&E jobs, not for S&E graduates in other jobs. 18 Calculations made by the authors based on data on graduates and S&E employment for every second year from 1985 through 2000; and the ratio is based on three-year moving averages of net employment growth. experience, etc). Moreover, it does not address future changes in supply or demand. But it certainly is suggestive that plenty of S&E students have been graduating relative to employment growth in S&E occupations. 19 Leaks in the Pipeline from School to Work. Naturally, not all S&E graduates will enter an S&E job, whether because of a change in interest, because their qualifications are not adequate, or because they never intended to enter an S&E career in the first place. However, there is a surprisingly low rate of S&E retention (high attrition) for the 1993 to 2001 cohorts of S&E graduates. One to two years after graduation, 20 percent of S&E bachelor's are in school but not in S&E studies, while another 45 percent are working but in non-S&E employment (total attrition of 65 percent). One to two years after graduation, 7 percent of S&E master's graduates are enrolled in school but not in S&E studies, while another 31 percent are working but in non-S&E employment (total attrition of 38 percent; NSF, 2006: Table 3). Does poor S&E education lead to higher attrition from the S&E pathway? One could surmise that poor high school preparation can lead college freshmen to drop out of S&E college majors. But research to date finds that once students enter an S&E pathway, prior science and math preparation or performance does not appear to be a strong causal factor of attrition. Rather, studies identify the quality of college education, be it inadequate teaching resources or poor pedagogy, as an important factor leading to attrition among S&E majors during their college career. Indeed, the literature on the retention of college-enrolled S&E majors almost uniformly identifies the causal factors of attrition as the pedagogical shortfalls of S&E classes rather than student performance. 20 Yet, college level outcomes, as discussed above, do not show any notable changes in the past decades. And, for example, the need for remediation at the college level has 19 This simple calculation appears not to square with a comparison of the annualized growth rate of S&E graduates and jobs from 1980 to 2000. That calculation finds that the annual growth rate of S&E graduates at all degree levels is about one third that of S&E employment growth (1.5 versus 4.2 percent annually). But the rate of growth argument is somewhat misleading insofar as the slower growth rate of S&E graduates is, as noted here, a far larger number than the smaller but more rapidly growing number of S&E jobs. At first blush, one might assume these sizable differences in growth rates bode poorly for the future, but projections at these rates of growth show that the number of graduates and jobs does not converge for about 20 years (see Science and Engineering Indicators, Appendix Table 3-2, http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind06/pdf_v2.htm). 20 A number of studies of attrition of college science and engineering majors find students citing the quality of instruction, the \"culture\" of the discipline, and other curricular issues. One of the most in-depth studies finds that these factors are more important than the student's skill or aptitude (Seymour and Hewitt 1997). not increased notably from the 1980s to the present day, albeit about one-tenth of college freshman require science and one-fifth require some math remediation (NSF 2006 , table 2). Still, students with low achievement may lead to low postgraduate transition and retention rates, which could be consistent with the findings of S&E education suffering from poor pedagogy, inadequate educational systems, or simply a surfeit of low performers who somehow make it into S&E fields of study. Table 3 examines the possibility that large numbers of S&E graduates have poor grades and, despite having a degree in hand, are not adequately prepared to either continue further S&E studies or take S&E employment. It shows that slightly higher performing students continue on an S&E pathway after graduation, but there is no dramatic change between 1995 and 2001. Only about a quarter of S&E bachelor's students with less than a 2.75 GPA stay on an S&E trajectory, while about a third of those with better GPAs stay the course. Similarly, about half of S&E master's students with less than a 2.75 GPA stay on an S&E trajectory, while nearly two-thirds of those with better GPAs stay the course. However, for those who enter the job market at each stage, a greater proportion of low-GPA graduates find S&E employment than do high-GPA students. The lower rate of job entry by high GPA graduates is due, in part, to higher GPA students continuing their education rather than entering the job market. However, the lower rate may also be the result of higher GPA students entering other, non-S&E careers (a point we are examining in current research). A low GPA is apparently not a bar to finding S&E employment. Furthermore, these general patterns have changed remarkably little between 1995 and 2001 and they indicate high rates of attrition regardless of preparation. Is an S&E Education Used in Non-S&E Jobs? Still, an S&E education may be used even outside of supposed S&E pathways because many non-S&E occupations may demand a substantial amount of S&E knowledge. Some graduates do S&E related work in a job that is outside the formal S&E classification, such as a patent lawyer. An S&E education may contribute to the jobs for yet other S&E graduates who are not in an S&E occupation, such as a manager in a technology firm. Thus, some portion of the non-S&E graduates directly use their S&E education in the labor market. The perceived relevance of an S&E education to job requirements has been examined for S&E graduates in both S&E jobs and non-S&E jobs. For S&E job holders there is, curiously, a rather imperfect fit between their education and how they perceive the relevance of that education to what they do on the job. A survey of all S&E graduates finds that only about 40 percent of bachelor's degree holders report that their job requires skills that are \"closely related\" to their college major, a share that increases to 61 and 69 percent for master's and doctorate degree holders (NSF 2006, tables 3-7). Considering that these workers are employed in S&E classified occupations, these percentages do not appear to be strikingly high. The perceived relevance of an S&E education for those graduates employed outside of S&E is very low. Of all workers whose highest degree was in an S&E field and who are employed in \"other than an S&E occupation,\" less than a quarter report that their education is \"closely related\" to their job. 21 Only a select few engineering degrees confer more transferability, such as chemical engineering graduates in a non-S&E occupation, of whom 40 percent report that their training is useful for their job. These findings do not support the presumption that S&E education is generally \"needed\" by the labor market. Few S&E graduates report using their S&E-specific education when employed outside of S&E occupations. To be sure, a rigorous S&E education may be beneficial, but these findings suggest that job holders do not, in fact, highly prize S&E education as a general or even as specific qualifier. At the same time, we note that, in general, graduates in all fields may not perceive their education as highly related to their occupation, and thus additional measures are needed to better understand the specific contribution of an S&E education to employment in non-S&E fields. In short, the U.S has been graduating more S&E students than there have been S&E jobs; hence, there are 15.7 million workers who report at least one degree in an S&E field but 4.8 million workers in an S&E occupation. There is, rather obviously, high attrition from school to work, and it simply cannot be explained by underachieving S&E graduates failing to qualify for jobs. At the same time, many of the S&E graduates outside of a formal S&E job may benefit from their training, but the simple indicators used here suggest that such training is not central to their current employment. This evidence suggests that the school-to-work attrition is neither due to poor educational preparation or, more optimistically, to the failure of formal occupational classifications to capture the extent to which S&E training is used in the labor market. Something else appears to be going on."}, {"section_title": "The S&E Job Market: What is the Nature of the Demand?", "text": "The pathway from high school student to college graduate has a number of transition points that are the primary focus of current policy initiatives. The goal of these initiatives is to increase the flow into, and retention within the S&E education pipeline. However, the data we have reviewed suggest that secondary and higher education systems are providing more than adequate supply for industry's hiring needs. Of course, these are aggregate numbers, so there still could be shortages for particular occupations or industries; targeted initiatives to increase the flow of underrepresented demographic and income groups are warranted to increase workforce opportunity and workforce diversity. But overall, addressing the presumed labor market problems through a broad-based focus on the education system seems a misplaced effort. Whether increasing the supply of S&E educated workforce entrants would have any significant impact on workforce supply (given a graduate pool already 50 percent larger than annual openings) is a question that requires a better understanding of the labor market for these graduates. Moreover, increasing the education supply with such low yields seems a highly inefficient approach without a better understanding of the factors involved in the transition rates at all points along the pathway. There is little comprehensive, systematic research on how college students choose an S&E career, either on the process or the factors that influence those choices. Standard labor market economics theory focuses on the marginal impact of wage rate differentials. Research on career counseling is focused on matching interests and occupations, based on the assumption that interests are more or less fixed. The science and engineering communities have launched education and outreach programs to high school students to increase interest in those fields. And some observers focus on the overall appeal of an occupation based on its job quality and content of work as important factors influencing its attraction to potential entrants. There is some research that sheds light on the role of these different factors in labor supply. A few labor market studies, notably by Richard Freeman andcolleagues (2004, 2006), have focused on the quality of S&E jobs. These studies conclude that the decline in the native S&E worker pool may reflect a weakening demand, a comparative decline in S&E wages, and labor market signals to students about low relative wages in S&E occupations. Indeed, research finds that the real wages in S&E occupations declined over the past two decades and labor market indicators suggest little shortage (Espenshade 1999). Some researchers see these demand-side market forces causing highly qualified students to pursue other careers. A well-accepted model of cyclical patterns of student and worker supply is the cobweb model (Freeman 1976). Research finds, in accordance with market mechanisms, that an increase in wages leads to an increase of job seekers but, in turn, a large supply of job seekers can depress wages. Declining wages will result in reduced student enrollments, although there is a lag in enrollment response. For example, research finds that a previous decline in mathematics enrollments through 1996 corresponded to this cycle (Davis 1997)."}, {"section_title": "Where's the Problem? Hiring Difficulties versus Labor Market Shortages", "text": "The assertion that education deficits are directly linked to employer reports of hiring difficulties is generally stated without much examination of the evidence. It is important to distinguish between problems an employer may have hiring the people he or she wants and an actual shortage of workers or potential workers. Although there may be a labor market shortage, all the evidence of \"shortages\" cited in the various policy reports is entirely individual employer accounts of problems in hiring. The industries most vocal about labor market shortages and the need to import workers may be voicing unrealistic expectations of experience more than skills or education of a new hire, or just cost. In previous research (Lynn and Salzman 2002), we found that managers in engineering and technology firms do not claim a shortage of applicants nor do they complain of applicants with poor math and science skills or education. They do often note difficulty in finding workers with sufficient experience, specific technical skills, or a sufficient number of \"brilliant\" workers in the pool. 22 The complaint, quite often, appears to be one of unrealistic expectations, as unwittingly illustrated in a recent BusinessWeek (2007) article on labor shortages: \"'There are certain professions where skills are in such demand that even average or below-average people can get hired,' says Michael Alter, president of SurePayroll Inc.\" Other than frustration at not having an applicant pool at the tail-end of the skill distribution, the skills deficit most likely to be mentioned are the \"soft skills\" of communication and the ease of working across organizational, cultural, and disciplinary boundaries (Lynn and Salzman 2002;Salzman 2000). Science and engineering firms most often complain about schools failing to provide students with the non-technical skills needed in today's firm. It is also worth noting that, more generally, employers do not complain about the math and science skills of employees hired for professional positions. In a study of engineering skills, technical qualifications were not identified as a concern by managers. 23 Employers' complaints about math skills typically involve examples of retail workers who can't count change or clerical applicants who lack basic literacy. And even for these levels the need is for a broad array of academic, social, and communication skills (Murnane and Levy 1996). opportunities. Human capital is a long-term investment and potential S&E students read all the tea leaves before investing. We have conducted interviews with current managers and engineers who believe that there is little future in entry-level engineering jobs in many industries, and IT in particular. Not only will it be difficult to fill mid-level and higher-level positions from an inexperienced workforce that never had an entry-level position, but several future generations of workers, currently in school, are developing their work interests and career aspirations based on their perceptions about the future state of labor markets. A range of public policies, such as immigration policy and corporate practices, such as offshoring R&D, affects the current workforce and future generations as well. There is also some evidence that the opportunity in the engineering field, the content of the work, and the overall working conditions are less appealing today than in the past. From our current study of engineering, we often heard engineers and managers noting the lack of motivating science and engineering \"problems\" or challenges, like those of the early days of IT, and the lack of national purpose that was evident during the heyday of the space program. Engineers and managers interviewed also pointed to changes in both the \"substance\" and process of engineering. Projects are larger, team efforts, and require more coordination and management (whether because of outsourcing, systems integration, or increased scale of the technology, such as large enterprise resource planning systems). Developing and building many artifacts may be more routinized and less challenging or interesting than before. As one colleague expressed it, \"How many 'real' engineers does it take to build a bridge?\" 24 These are attributes of both the intrinsic interest of the field and the cultural milieu, or zeitgeist, of science and engineering. Although these factors are difficult to measure, they were noted by interviewees as often as diminished job prospects in explaining why they would not enter the field today. Some S&E graduates simply leave the field because they lose interest in the application of their training or, more prosaically yet, they find that the labor market pays more for them to take other jobs (e.g., Freeman 2006). It is thus important to examine the full spectrum of labor market signals that can influence student and worker career choices. There are multiple dimensions of career choice and identify factors that influence these outcomes. Finally, it would be important to understand the different S&E labor markets by industry, occupation, geography, and demographic. The labor market studies examine market conditions that may influence career choice in aggregate. Less often do these studies examine choices by different demographic groups on entering specific S&E occupations or industries. For example, some S&E occupations appear to attract large numbers of traditional S&E students-U.S. native white males -but in others females outnumber males, and other occupations are disproportionately filled by immigrants. In addition to documenting overall labor market trends, it is important to understand specific industry dynamics. The IT industry labor market may be different from that of biotechnology or mechanical engineering (e.g., 40 percent of the IT workforce does not have a four-year degree; biotechnology has one of the largest concentrations of Ph.D.'s in industry; engineering is predominantly a bachelor's degreed workforce). Although the labor market analyses examine changes in relative wages for S&E jobs and non-S&E jobs with similar education requirements (e.g., other professional jobs), they have not so far determined what affects the industry and occupation decisions of today's young people who could potentially enter S&E careers. 24 Michael Horrigan an economist at Bureau of Labor Statistics suggests that between the advances in knowledge for many engineering undertakings and technology shifts, say in using more engineering software, the role of engineering has likely changed and it may be that fewer jobs involve the engineering challenge of yesteryear (Personal communication, January 13, 2006). In our studies of engineering, we find that outsourcing and offshoring lead to new engineering management layers and engineers comment that they now manage engineering project"}, {"section_title": "Conclusion and Policy Discussion", "text": "Current policy is driven by the twin perceptions of a labor market shortage of scientists and engineers and of a pool of qualified students that is small in number and declining in quality. Math and science education are viewed as the primary policy levers to increase labor market supply, supplemented by increased immigration. But those policy proposals that call for more math and science education, aimed at increasing the number of scientists and engineers, do not square with the educational performance and employment data that we have reviewed. Our review of the data finds not only little evidence to support those positions and, in fact, the available evidence indicates an ample supply of students whose preparation and performance has been increasing over the past decades. We are concerned that the consensus prescriptions are based on some misperceptions about efficient strategies for economic and social prosperity. It is difficult to conclude that the major economic \"threats\" to the United States are related to the performance levels of U.S. students as compared to students in other countries. Our major economic competitors, particularly emerging nation behemoths, are not among top test scoring nations. In fact, a sizeable portion of U.S. students perform at the top of the scale and graduate in substantial numbers. The logic of the education crisis reports fails on several of their key points. These reports focus on countries that score higher than the United States, primarily just on math, and then conclude these countries pose a \"threat\" to the U.S. economy. Should U.S. policy be driven by test score performance of students in Flemish Belgium, Latvian-speaking Latvia, or even Singapore, with 4.5 million people and a workforce of 2.4 million (one-sixtieth the size of the U.S. workforce)? How will these countries find the capital and the numbers of workers needed to \"steal\" any major portion of a U.S. industry? Perhaps one should, instead, look at the countries that are \"competing\" with the United States and examine the ways in which they are doing so and the ways in which the United States is, in comparison, deficient. As noted, nearly all the major global powers are not even on the list of rather than engage in \"real\" engineering. Others have commented that engineering is less central to \"innovation\" or at least product development than design, marketing, and other areas. leading test scoring countries. One of the countries that is a leading technology force, Singapore, is trying to emulate U.S. innovation and creativity and de-emphasize strict math and science test performance. 25 Will better math and science performance increase the number of software programming jobs remaining in the United States? This seems unlikely until the Beijing or Bangalore wage is on parity with U.S. wages. Will better math and science education improve innovation? There is little empirical support for the argument that more math and science education will produce more scientists and engineers which, in turn, will increase the level of innovation. Nor does research establish that better test scores will improve the innovation performance of scientists and engineers who enter the workforce. Some even argue that science and engineering are less important economic drivers than they were in the past (Hill, 2007). There is an unexamined assumption that the United States is best served by the goal to be first in the world in science and math test scores. This confuses means and ends. First, the means to improving education is probably not through a narrow focus on math and science. The math and science deficits are not among the populations who are well-educated but, rather, the research suggests, those with non-school factors that hinder academic performance. As Boe and Shin argue, \"The U.S. is not 'first in the industrialized world' in minimizing the percentage of its population living in poverty\u2026. So why should anyone expect the U.S. to be first in the world in educational achievement? There is, after all, abundant evidence that these types of social indicators are strongly associated with educational achievement\" (2005,694). A focus on the average test scores obscures the distribution of performance and its root causes. Policy reports that focus on the performance of the upper end of the distribution (e.g., more AP classes and other advanced math and science coursework) assume that improvements here will increase S&E workforce size. 25 Perhaps tellingly, Singapore's recent \"competitiveness\" policy focuses on creativity and developing a more broad-based education. Its other central workforce development strategy is filling in the island's surrounding ocean so that it can expand its total population by 2.5 million. In contrast to the policy focus of U.S. competitiveness committees calling for the U.S. to emulate Singapore's math and science education programs, Singapore government proclamations include statements such as: \"Creative Industries have been recognised by the Economic Review Committee in 2003 as a new and promising area to grow and play a vital role in differentiating Singapore's value proposition.\" (Creative Industries Singapore; http://www.creativeindustries.sg/public/strategy/) \"The new architects of the global economic landscape are those who apply their imagination, creativity and knowledge to generate new ideas and create new value. Multi-dimensional creativity-artistic creativity, business entrepreneurship and technological innovation-will be the new currency of success.\" http://www.mica.gov.sg/mica_business/b_creative.html But low averages and the pool of future high performers must be addressed by improving the performance of particular disadvantaged groups that face barriers to education that are not addressed by expanding or even improving math and science education. If improvement in national test score performance is the goal, greater improvements are more likely to come from improving the test scores of those in the lower end of the distribution. Although there are initiatives to address these problems, they need to be stepped up in \"competitiveness\" policy because these groups account for much of the international \"performance gap.\" Efficiency alone would dictate a focus on these groups as the most effective policy to increase U.S. performance. Another policy assumption is that test performance and more scientists and engineers will improve economic performance. The TIMSS analysis suggests curriculum changes would increase test scores by narrowing the curriculum and focusing on particular math and science components of the curriculum. Yet, it seems a different question should be asked: What are the factors that have led to the consistent high performance of the U.S. economy? Which factors have provided the U.S. economy more consistent growth than countries that more consistently score high on international tests? And what kind of workforce is likely to improve prospects of the United States in the future? In a provocative article, Ramirez et al. (2006) argue that policies to increase economic growth by improving aggregate student achievement are \"not based on research evidence\" (2006:1). They develop a number of regression models to test the relationships between educational performance and economic growth for nearly 40 countries over the period 1970 through 2000. They find that student achievement levels in math and science \"has no effect on tertiary enrollment in science and engineering\" (p. 17), and a tenuous relationship between educational achievement levels and national economic performance. They argue that the four Asian countries of South Korea, Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong are outliers and that their high academic achievement is endogenous. Without those countries, there is no cross-national relationship between level of education and national economic performance. This is also consistent with the TIMSS researchers finding of no relationship between TIMSS ranking and GNP. Instead, Ramirez et al. argue, \"student achievement is an indicator of national commitments to development rather than a means to this development\" (p.15). 26 Finally, assessing the claims of labor market shortages is crucial. Purported labor market shortages for scientists and engineers are anecdotal and also not supported by the available evidence. Little analysis has been conducted of hiring difficulties by firms and the supply of workers. A particular employer or industry's experiences in hiring could be the result of any number of factors. The assumption that difficulties in hiring is due just to supply can have counterproductive consequences: an increase in supply that leads to high unemployment, lowered wages and decline in working conditions will have the long-term effect of weakening future supply by discouraging current students. Moreover, by bringing immigrants directly into the S&E workforce but without the attachments immigrants develop through longer residency and schooling in the United States, there is likely to be greater geographical workforce mobility. As the physical infrastructure of emerging nations improves, the location of innovation and R&D is likely to follow rather than determine the location of human capital. Investing in domestic human capital can provide longer-term benefits to the United States and a collaborative approach with those countries will capture the benefits of their human capital development rather than trying to absorb it through short-term immigration to address short-term hiring needs Salzman 2006, 2007). The characteristics of human capital development and employment are qualitatively different from that of prior periods, and we should not fall back on past approaches to policy. Instead, evidence-based policy is necessary for developing effective programs for the emerging global economy. 26 They further suggest that \"much of the achievement 'effect' is not really causal in character. It may be, rather, that nation-states with strong pro-development policies, and with regimes powerful enough to enforce these, produce both more economic growth and more disciplined student-achievement levels in fields (e.g., science and mathematics) perceived to be especially development related\" (p.15). But even this \"Asian exceptionalism\" is weak when the recent period of slow growth is included in the equations. Moreover, \"the apparent achievement effect decreases (rather than increases, as we expect) with the increased level of educational enrollments in a country.\" They find that, to the extent that educational achievement levels are related to low economic growth, it is only nations at the bottom third of the educational distribution that have lower performance with no to little difference among countries in the upper two-thirds of the educational rankings."}]
