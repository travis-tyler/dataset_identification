These parallels suggest the possibility that the lower testosterone levels in elderly men contribute to many other age-associated conditions. Prior trials of the effects of testosterone treatment of elderly men, however, yielded equivocal results. The Testosterone Trials are a coordinated set of clinical trials designed to determine if testosterone treatment would benefit elderly men who have low testosterone concentrations and conditions of which low testosterone may be a cause or a contributor.\nCross-sectional studies, such as the European Male Aging Study [1] , and longitudinal studies, such as the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging [2], showed gradual decreases in testosterone with increasing age. As men age, they also experience decreased muscle mass [3, 4] and mobility [5], decreased sexual function [6], decreased energy, anemia [7], decline in memory and other cognitive functions [8], decreased bone mineral density [9] and increased fractures [10], increased fat mass [11], and impaired glucose tolerance [12].\nSeveral randomized, placebo-controlled trials studied the effects of testosterone treatment of elderly men with low-normal to slightly low serum testosterone concentrations. Testosterone treatment consistently increased lean mass and decreased fat mass [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] and tended to increase bone mineral density of the spine [18, 19] . Effects on muscle strength and physical performance [13] [14] [15] 17, 20] , sexual function [13, 17, 20] , cognition [21, 22] , and energy [13, 17, 21] were inconsistent.\nIn 2003, a panel of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences concluded that the evidence did not demonstrate any clear beneficial effect of testosterone treatment of elderly men and recommended a coordinated set of clinical trials to determine if such treatment would have any benefit. It recommended not conducting a long-term trial to evaluate risk until efficacy had been demonstrated [23] . The Testosterone Trials were designed to implement this recommendation.\nMethods\nThe major feature of The Testosterone Trials design is a coordinated set of clinical trials to test the efficacy of testosterone treatment in elderly men who had a low serum testosterone and one or more clinical abnormalities that low testosterone may cause. Each trial was designed to test the effect of testosterone on a clinical condition that testosterone is known to improve in men who have severe hypogonadism due to known disease of the pituitary or testes. The rationale for coordinating many aspects of these trials -including the recruitment, screening, treatment, and monitoring for safety, as well as the study governance and management -was to facilitate uniform selection and treatment and to allow pooling of safety data.\nCoordination also had two practical advantages. The first was cost-efficiency, since the same recruiting, screening, and study management was used for all trials. Costs also were reduced greatly because participants could, when they qualified, enroll in more than one trial, reducing the total number who had to be identified, screened, and treated. The second was simplifying study management by having a single steering committee, data coordinating center and Data and Safety Monitoring Board, and the same field sites for all trials.\nThe major factors considered in choosing inclusion and exclusion criteria for the common aspects of the trial (Table 1) were age, serum testosterone concentration, conditions that could interfere with the interpretation of the results, and conditions that testosterone treatment could exacerbate.\nWe chose 65 years as the lower age limit because it is a commonly used cutoff for studies of the elderly. The testosterone trials: study design 363 http://ctj.sagepub.com Clinical Trials 2014; 11: 362-375\nWe used the serum total testosterone concentration for screening, even though it is the free testosterone that is biologically active, because assays for total testosterone are more accurate and better standardized than those for free, and usually, total testosterone accurately reflects the free [24] . In addition, total testosterone assays are more widely available than free testosterone assays and more commonly used in clinical practice.\nWe selected a serum testosterone value for inclusion intended to be low enough that it would be considered unequivocally low but high enough that we would meet recruitment targets that provided the desired statistical power. The lower limit of the normal range of total testosterone for young men usually is considered to be about 300 ng/dL early in the morning. Based on these considerations, we chose to include men whose serum testosterone was \\250 ng/dL at 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. on two occasions; because this stringent requirement hampered recruiting, we later relaxed the criteria to \\275 ng/ dL on the first screen, \\300 ng/dL on the second, and \\275 ng/dL for the average of the two assays.\nParticipants also were required to have one or more symptoms that could be consequent to the low testosterone in order to qualify for one of the three main trials (see main trials, below).\nA final consideration in participant selection was to exclude men who were at relatively high risk of having conditions that testosterone treatment may exacerbate, such as prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, erythrocytosis, and sleep apnea (Table 1) .\nWe excluded men who had a history of prostate cancer or prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, men who had a palpable prostate nodule by digital rectal examination, and men who had a relatively high risk of undiagnosed prostate cancer by the Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator [25] . We adjusted the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level to what it would have been had the participant's serum testosterone been normal, using unpublished data from the European Male Aging Study (courtesy, Dr Frederick Wu) that showed a significant association between the serum PSA and testosterone concentrations in men 65 years whose serum testosterone was \\460 ng/ dL and PSA was \\4 ng/mL. The regression coefficient was 0.00128 (p = 0.007), and the coefficient of determination (r 2 ) was 0.016. The correction factor ((460 2 serum testosterone concentration) 3 0.00128) was added to the measured PSA to give the PSA value used in the risk calculator.\nWe excluded men whose risk of any prostate cancer was .35% and risk of high-grade cancer was .7%, values we considered conservative. For example, a 75year-old Caucasian man who had no family history of prostate cancer could have had a serum PSA no higher than 2.8 ng/mL to qualify by this criterion.\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia is also dependent on testosterone and its conversion to dihydrotestosterone [26, 27] . We therefore also excluded men who had symptoms of severe lower urinary tract symptoms, as defined by a score of .19 on the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire.\nWe excluded men who had hemoglobin concentrations .16.0 g/dL and men with diagnosed but untreated sleep apnea."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Background The prevalence of low testosterone levels in men increases with age, as does the prevalence of decreased mobility, sexual function, self-perceived vitality, cognitive abilities, bone mineral density, and glucose tolerance, and of increased anemia and coronary artery disease.

We chose AndroGel 1% in a pump bottle (AbbVie).\nTestosterone and placebo kits were prepared by the central pharmacy and sent to sites with numbers incorporated into the data management system that linked participant identification number to a kit number when the participant was randomized.\nThe goal of testosterone treatment was to increase the serum testosterone concentration of the men assigned to the testosterone arm to within the normal range for young men and maintain it during the 1 year of treatment. The initial dose was 5 g of gel.\nThe serum testosterone concentration was measured at months 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9 in a central laboratory (Quest Diagnostics Clinical Trials, Valencia, CA, USA).

Compliance was assessed by weighing used and unused pump bottles. To maintain blinding, when we changed the gel dose (number of depressions of the pump bottle) of a man in the testosterone arm, we simultaneously changed the dose of gel of a participant in the placebo arm who recently had had blood drawn at the same visit but at a different clinical site. Dose adjustment was prompted by messages from a designated Data Coordinating Center research coordinator to site investigators based on testosterone levels measured centrally and communicated to the designated Data Coordinating Center research coordinator.\nWe monitored the performance of the testosterone assay in collaboration with the Testosterone Standardization Program of the Centers for Disease Control by periodically inserting blinded aliquots of testosterone pools into the assay."}, {"section_title": "Monitoring participants for potential adverse effects of testosterone", "text": "Participants were monitored during the 1 year of treatment for development of conditions that testosterone could exacerbate.

When selecting participants, the most important inclusion criterion was the serum testosterone concentration, because the goal of the study was to determine if raising the testosterone levels of elderly men with unequivocally low testosterone would benefit them. In calculating the required sample size for each of the seven trials, the most important decision was to set the power at 90% for all three of the main trials and for three of four remaining trials so that both positive and negative outcomes would be assessed with a high level of precision and thus have important implications for clinical practice. In choosing specific outcomes, we aimed for those that were clinically relevant. We also chose differences between treatment arms that would be clinically meaningful. Perhaps the most unusual aspect of the study design was conducting seven trials, each with its own outcomes, under the umbrella of a single study. This structure had several advantages. The major scientific advantage was standardization of common entry criteria (e.g., testosterone concentration), treatment, and monitoring. Because of this standardization, findings from the seven trials can be compared with each other more readily. The logistical and financial advantages of this design were having one governing structure, one data coordinating center, one group of clinical trial sites, and one set of supporting teams. There was an even larger financial advantage by enrolling participants in more than one trial whenever eligible, since approximately half of the study cost was for recruitment.\nAllowing participants to enroll in more than one trial also had a disadvantage. Although qualified participants could participate in all three main trials, as well as the Cardiovascular and Bone Trials, the number of tests that could be done in any one trial had to be limited to reduce participant burden.\nA limitation of these trials is that the total number of subjects (789) is not nearly large enough, nor the duration of observation (2 years) long enough, to determine if testosterone treatment increases the risk of conditions that may be testosteronedependent. We estimated that it would take 6000 men randomized to testosterone or placebo and followed for 6 years to determine if testosterone increases the risk of prostate cancer by 30%.\nThe Testosterone Trials, in summary, are a highly coordinated group of seven randomized, placebocontrolled, multicenter trials designed to determine if testosterone treatment will benefit elderly men with low serum testosterone concentrations and conditions for which low testosterone may be a cause or a contributor. The advantages of the study design included common entry criteria, treatment, and monitoring; the efficiency of having the same The testosterone trials: study design 371 steering committee, data coordinating center, Data and Safety Monitoring Board, and trial sites; and the efficiency of participant enrollment in more than one trial. If these trials demonstrate sufficient benefits, a larger trial of longer duration will be necessary to assess safety. All participants who were anemic were enrolled in the Anemia Trial.\nThe testosterone trials: study design 373"}]
