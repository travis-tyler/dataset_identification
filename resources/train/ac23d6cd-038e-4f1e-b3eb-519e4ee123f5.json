[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract. Models of misfolded proteins (MP) aim at discovering the bio-mechanical propagation properties of neurological diseases (ND) by identifying plausible associated dynamical systems. Solving these systems along the full disease trajectory is usually challenging, due to the lack of a well defined time axis for the pathology. This issue is addressed by disease progression models (DPM) where long-term progression trajectories are estimated via time reparametrization of individual observations. However, due to their loose assumptions on the dynamics, DPM do not provide insights on the bio-mechanical properties of MP propagation. Here we propose a unified model of spatio-temporal protein dynamics based on the joint estimation of long-term MP dynamics and time reparameterization of individuals observations. The model is expressed within a Gaussian Process (GP) regression setting, where constraints on the MP dynamics are imposed through non-linear dynamical systems. We use stochastic variational inference on both GP and dynamical system parameters for scalable inference and uncertainty quantification of the trajectories. Experiments on simulated data show that our model accurately recovers prescribed rates along graph dynamics and precisely reconstructs the underlying progression. When applied to brain imaging data our model allows the bio-mechanical interpretation of amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease, leading to plausible simulations of MP propagation, and achieving accurate predictions of individual MP deposition in unseen data."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "A peculiarity of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) is the misfolding and subsequent accumulation of pathological proteins in the brain, leading to cellular Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

Misfolded protein (MP) aggregates can self-propagate and spread the pathology between cells and tissues, along functional or structural brain networks [2] .\nWith the aim of describing such processes, a variety of mathematical models has been proposed for providing better insight into the microscopic kinetic dynamics governing the processes of proteins propagation [3] . Complementarily, another class of models relies on macroscopic measurements from molecular and structural imaging for describing the effects of MP propagation along brain networks [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] . Such MP kinetics models are of strategic relevance, as they may provide new understanding of the mechanisms involved in NDs, and thus allow identification of novel strategies for treatment and diagnosis. These models usually define the propagation dynamics through diffusion equations. This modelling choice allows to reduce the number of parameters to be estimated, but comes at the expenses of an oversimplification of the dynamics governing the MP process. First, while the pathological kinetics may be assimilated to diffusive processes in short term observations, the long term evolution of NDs are unlikely to have diffusive properties. For example, the asymptotically constant behaviour of NDs may not be described by the stationary and constant rate of change specified by diffusion equations. Second, such models require a precise definition of the time axis, which is typically not well defined in clinical data sets. To address this issue, several alternative disease progression models (DPM) have been proposed [9, 10, 11, 12] . These approaches allow to reconstruct biomarkers trajectories along the long term disease progression by \"stitching\" together short term individual measurements. Each subject is characterized by specific time parameters quantifying their pathological stage with respect to the estimated global group-wise evolution. However, these models provide an \"apparent\" description of biomarkers dynamics, without in fact elucidating the kinetics and relationships across biomarkers.\nTo date, no modelling framework allows for joint MP kinetics modelling and reconstruction of the biomarkers dynamics across the whole disease long term evolution. The problem is challenging since it requires to simultaneously account for short term observations to reconstruct the long term disease progression, and to estimate group-wise dynamics parameters specified by high-dimensional dynamical systems.\nIn this paper we solve this problem by formulating a model for the dynamics of MP accumulation, clearance and propagation (ACP) across structural brain networks, which includes data-driven estimates of the long term protein trajectories from short term data. Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of our framework. The ACP model is formulated as a constrained regression problem in a Bayesian non-parametric setting, where the MP progression is modelled by a Gaussian Process (GP), and constraints on the MP dynamics are imposed through systems of non linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The Bayesian setting allows for uncertainty quantification of the MP dynamics while, to achieve tractability, the inference problem is solved via stochastic variational inference. The constrained regression framework provides a complete Fig. 1 . Schematic representation of our framework. Here we have two brain regions whose MP concentrations c1 and c2 are collected for many subjects over a short term time span (A). The dynamics of such concentrations is described in terms of the accumulation, clearance and propagation processes, with unknown parameters (B). The proposed Bayesian framework estimates the distribution of such parameters (here plotted against their ground truth values -the vertical black lines in the distributions subplot), and the long term trajectories with respect to the estimated disease time axis (C).\ndescription of the MP dynamics, which can be subsequently used for simulating and predicting MP changes over time through forward integration of the estimated dynamical systems. The estimated MP dynamics also provide an instrument to investigate different hypotheses of MP propagation.\nWe test our framework against synthetic data and compare its performances in recovering the simulated evolution and the time reparameterization as compared to standard disease progression models based on monotonic constraints. Finally, we demonstrate our framework on AV45-PET data of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) subjects from the ADNI data set. We show that it allows to compare different hypothesis of MP kinetics: diffusive vs non-linear and time-varying dynamics properties (ACP). We show that the ACP model outperforms diffusive ones in terms of prediction of amyloid deposition in unseen follow-up data."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Non-linear and time-varying MP kinetics model", "text": "We consider the brain as a system of N interconnected regions, where each region i (i = 1, ..., N ) is characterized by its concentration c i (t) of MP proteins along time. Standard MP kinetics models are based on the definition of dynamical systems of the form\u010b (t) = \u03b2Ac(t),\nwhere c(t) is the vector of concentrations of MP across brain regions, A is a diffusion matrix and \u03b2 is the parameter describing MP propagation. The operator A is usually defined as the graph Laplacian of the brain connectome, while \u03b2 is typically assumed to be constant throughout the whole disease progression [4] .\nHere we introduce an extension of this paradigm which accounts for the dynamics characterized by the time-varying and non-linear parameters of MP accumulation, brain response via MP clearance, and long term propagation across neighbouring neuronal cells: the ACP model. Within this setting, equation (1) is reformulated as\u010b\nwhere the matrix M ACP is factorized into (dependence on t is omitted but implied):\nHere, M AC (c) accounts for the total aggregation of MP plaques, i.e. sum of accumulation and clearance, while the remaining two matrices describe long-range propagation from (M out (c)) or to (M in (c)) for each region. Our assumptions on the MP dynamics are the following:\n-no aggregation nor propagation occur in healthy conditions. MP plaques aggregation develops when the accumulation-clearance equilibrium breaks. This can be modelled with the assumption thatk a \u2212k c > 0, wherek \u00b7 are the maximum rates of accumulation and clearance and are assumed to be constant across regions. We definek t :=k a \u2212k c as the maximum rate of total aggregation. -We hypothesize a region-dependent critical threshold \u03b7 i above which the aggregation process reaches a plateau. This is modelled by a sigmoid function\n-When passing a critical threshold \u03b3 j the MP concentration in each region j saturates and triggers propagation towards the connected regions. Also, it reaches a plateau when passing a threshold \u03b7 j . Again this can be modelled by a function asymptotically dropping to zero:\nrepresenting the non-linear rate of propagation from region j to region i. Herek ij is the maximum rate of propagation between the two regions, and we assumek ij =k ji . We combine the propagation coefficients in a matrix describing the global brain-scale propagation process: K(c) = (k ij (c j )) ij . -The substrate for propagation is the structural connectome, here represented by the symmetric and normalized adjacency matrix of connections between brain regions A = (\u03b1 ij ).\nSuch assumptions are formalized into the following functionals:\nOverall, the ACP model depends on 1+2N +"}, {"section_title": "Extending MP dynamics modelling to account for time reparametrization", "text": "Once defined our dynamical system as the one described in (2), we need to incorporate it within a regression framework for short term data. Let us assume to have S subjects for which we have measures of MP concentrations C in N brain regions at different time-points, encoded in a vector t: C is therefore the realization of c(t) at times t. For notation simplicity we assume here t to be the same for every subject, but computations extend easily to more general cases. The observations C for subject k at a time points t can be modelled as a random sample from the following generative model [10] :\nHere f is the fixed effect function modeling the concentrations' longitudinal evolution and is modelled as a GP; \u03c4 k (t) is the individual time reparametrization with respect to the global group-wise evolution, and is modelled as a linear shift \u03c4 k = t k + d k ; \u03bd k is the individual random effect, assumed to be Gaussian correlated perturbations N (0, \u03c6 k N ); is the observational noise.

Such approximation extends to the derivatives of the GP thanks to the chain rule [13] . As a result, the GP function and its derivatives can be both identified by the parameters W and \u2126. Solving (10) amounts at doing inference on F , which in this setting means inference on W and \u2126. Following [14] , we optimize (10) through variational inference of W , \u2126 and \u03b8.

This vector field is obtained by integrating the dynamical system estimated for respectively ACP and diffusion models. Therefore it does not correspond to extrapolation of the curves in Figure 3A) . Here the other biomarkers are set constant to their mean values. We can appreciate the non-linear dynamics of the ACP model, as well as the linear dynamics of the diffusive model. The resulting vector fields provide a tool for interpreting and comparing mechanistic hypotheses. Indeed, Figure 3C) shows that the ACP model estimates an initial fast propagation, which slows down with time. The opposite behaviour is observed by analyzing the dynamics of the diffusion model, with an acceleration in the propagation along with the progression. This behaviour is unlikely to reproduce real-case scenarios, where amyloid aggregation eventually slows down and does not accumulates indefinitely. This result points to the higher biological plausibility of the proposed ACP model. For each subject in D1 with follow-up measurements in D2, we computed the streamline associated with their individual dynamics (in the whole 11-D space), and estimated the values of each biomarker at the corresponding follow-up time. We computed the RMSE for each estimate, and bootstrapped over the MP dynamic parameters 200 times, obtaining RMSE distributions (Table 4 ). Figure 4 shows the connectomes where the edges' colors are set to be proportional to the values of the estimated MP parameters for the ACP model (plot on the left hemisphere), or to the values of the propagation parameters for the diffusive model (plot on the right hemisphere).
