[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) is an annual survey sponsored by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) and the USDA Economic Research Service (ERS) and administered by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) in three phases. Through the analysis of ARMS data, users capture a snapshot of the current state of agriculture. Data users of the ARMS survey include Congress, USDA, NASS, ERS, Bureau of Economic Analysis, researchers, and agri-business officials. The data from the third phase of the survey (ARMS III) is used as part of an analysis to establish and review policy and to develop forecasts for agricultural income and expenses. The ARMS III survey instrument is long and complex. It asks detailed characteristics and financial information about the farming operation, field practices, and the operator's household to assess the link between policy, operation profitability, and operator household financial health. NASS has taken steps to increase awareness of the benefits of the survey and to reduce respondent burden. Item nonresponse can be over 50% in the responding units for some items requested on the questionnaire (Miller and O'Connor, 2012). Despite the difficulty in obtaining full responses from all operations that are sampled, the need remains from ARMS III data users to perform effective multivariate statistical analysis with the high-dimensional, mixed-type data. With item responses missing, care must be taken to ensure that estimates are not biased and subsequent inferences are valid. The potential magnitude of the bias increases as the proportion of missing responses increases. Although the calibration of the sampling weights is useful in mitigating bias in many estimated totals (Earp, et. al., 2008), the potential disturbance of the true variation and of the complex relationships among the items of ARMS III is of concern. To mitigate bias of estimates and to maintain the integrity of relationships in ARMS III data in the presence of item nonresponse, NASS uses imputation. In 2009, NASS entered into a cooperative agreement with the National Institute of Statistical Sciences to update the imputation methodology used for ARMS III to better reflect the multivariate nature of the data. The review of potential options focused on two classes of modern methods that showed the greatest potential for application to ARMS III data: 1) data augmentation procedures for multivariate normal data (DA) and 2) a class of methods that build an imputation model via fully conditional specification (FCS). Schafer (1997) describes DA in detail, and implementations of the methodology can be found in the software package NORM (Schafer 1999) and within the SAS procedure MI (Yuan 2014). The DA method was applied to ARMS III data (following data transformations) in  and was shown to markedly outperform the ARMS III conditional mean imputation method. However, one drawback of this method is that the imputer is forced to assume that there exists a relationship among all variables in the model. With the high dimensionality of the ARMS III dataset, this was an unreasonable assumption. Van Buuren et al. (2006) describes the benefits and drawbacks of FCS in detail. FCS develops a conditional model for each variable by conditioning on all other variables, which allows the imputer flexibility to impute where the joint distribution is not explicitly defined (e.g. mixed categorical and continuous data). However, the joint distribution is implicitly assumed. By conditioning on all other variables, the joint distribution is overspecified; consequentially, the Markov chain may diverge. FCS appears in several widely-used imputation algorithms, including MICE (Van Buuren and Oudshoorn 1999); SRMI, which is built into the well-known IVEware package (Raghunathan et al. 2001); mi (Gelman and Hill 2011); and the SAS MI procedure (Yuan 2014). Methodology to update the ARMS III imputation methodology was developed by a cross-sector (NASS/ERS and academia), cross-discipline (statisticians and economists) team over the course of the two-year agreement. It is called Iterative Sequential Regression (ISR) and is described by Robbins et al. as a blend of FCS and DA (Robbins, et al, 2013). ISR is a regression-based technique that allows for flexibility in the selection of conditional models while providing a valid joint distribution. Parameter estimates and imputations are obtained using a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling method . NASS further developed the ISR methodology and research program into an operational program implemented in 2015; however, ISR has drawbacks. The current methodology is not suitable for categorical or ordinal data types. It also does not allow for the use of truncated distributions, which are useful for employing bounds on imputations. Bounded imputations are an especially appealing feature when single imputations are used in the survey process. IVEware is an off the shelf software program that is ready to be applied to a variety of datatypes and can impute within some edit bounds. NASS is interested in comparing ISR to IVEware to determine if developing ISR to be appropriate for use in additional NASS survey programs should be a priority."}, {"section_title": "Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS)", "text": "The ARMS is administered in three phases. The first phase is a screening phase for inscope and in-business farms as well as presence of the targeted commodities for that year, which changes from year-to-year. The second phase asks for detailed field-level data for the targeted commodity for that year. The third phase (ARMS III) is a multi-mode, dual frame survey conducted annually in all states except Alaska and Hawaii. The sample consists of approximately 35,000 farms and ranches selected from NASS's list and area frames. The list frame is a potentially incomplete enumeration of agricultural establishments within the U.S., so the area frame augments the list frame by providing a non-zero probability to all such establishments in the United States. The survey questionnaire is mailed to the entire sample, but additional modes of data collection include web and face-to-face. The questionnaire contains over 800 items for the respondent to complete and for NASS to process after data collection. Based on data collected from the ARMS III, NASS publishes estimates of farm production expenditures for the U.S. (except Alaska and Hawaii) and five regions. The regional estimates are broken down by some of the leading cash receipt states and then all other states within the region. Farm production expenditures are also estimated for eight economic sales classes and for two farm type categories. In addition to farm production expenditures, the ARMS III collects data on production practices and costs of production for one to three targeted crop and livestock commodities each year, selected on a rotational basis. The production practices and cost of production data for these designated commodities are collected in the top producing states while the farm production expenditures data are collected in all states (except Alaska and Hawaii). Processing for the ARMS III survey is conducted in steps (See Figure 1). In the first step, a computer edit checks the consistency of the data and verifies that data values fall within a certain range. A statistician reviews all questionnaire items flagged as errors, and either manually imputes data or marks the items to be imputed as non-zero by a separate statistical imputation process near the end of data collection. In the 2014 survey year, eighty items were eligible to be flagged for the statistical imputation process. Typically, manual imputation is performed when the statistician has knowledge about the questionnaire item for that operation. Other variables may be flagged for imputation; however, these variables are flagged for ERS and handled by ERS in a separate process. Statistical imputation (the second step) is run after all of the items on the records pass the edit or have been flagged for statistical imputation. Once the data are imputed, the third phase begins with a re-run through an edit. After the edit has flagged any new errors, the statistician can make changes to fields to resolve an edit flag. The sampling weights are then calibrated; the final phase of editing and imputation is outlier analysis. Weights are changed and re-calibrated as necessary. After all of the phases are complete, the data are summarized and NASS produces a report that includes estimated totals of farm production expenses. The dataset used for the summary is passed to ERS for further multivariate analysis.

"}, {"section_title": "Transformations/Untransformations 2. Model Selection 3. Generation of Imputations", "text": "Transformation techniques are used to handle the semi-continuous nature of the ARMS III dataset. The density of many ARMS III items can be described as a mixture of a skewed distribution and a point mass at zero. ISR is designed to impute non-zero values. In ARMS, all missing values are assumed to be non-zero; this is determined through the edit and manual imputation processes. The zero portions of the variables are set to missing and the non-zero portion of the variables are transformed to be normal using one of a suite of transformations available in the procedure: log, log skew normal, log kernel density, and log empirical density. The transformations can be specified within a parameter file, or a default can be used where the transformation used is determined by the number of non-zero observations available. Model structure in ISR allows the imputation procedure to run jointly on a group of variables, while allowing select variables (both imputed and fully observed) to span across blocks by defining each variable's role in the model. Model Groups are selected and some Model Groups are run together. Model Groups that run together are in the same Imputation Group. Descriptions of the roles are in Table 1 and a diagram of the dependencies are in Figure 2. The program will drop potential covariates from the models where the number of pairwise non-zero values are too few or a covariate may lead to a poorly conditioned covariance matrix. Imputations are generated via MCMC sampling from the joint distribution of the variables requiring imputation conditioned on the fully observed covariates. The procedure is initialized using a sequential regression and may be regarded as an application-specific example of the initialization step of the SRMI technique of Raguhnathan, et al. (2001). ISR executes Gibbs sampling (Geman and Geman, 1984;Gelfand and Smith, 1990) and iterative draws of parameters from the posterior distribution and then imputations from the conditional distributions. The technique used falls into a general class of methods known as data augmentation (DA, Tanner and Wong, 1987). The transformation and modeling ensures that the series of conditional models are jointly normal. Because a valid density is formed, established theory (Tierney 1994) assures convergence of the chain. Hence, ISR has theoretical justification and some flexibility in selection of certain conditional distributions. However, ISR is not constructed to retain theoretical justification when data that are not continuous or semi-continuous in nature are imputed. For production of official statistics and ERS usage, NASS implemented the ISR method in R and C. A SAS interface was developed to integrate this program into existing production systems. An open source implementation was also developed as an R package (Lisic, 2016). "}, {"section_title": "IVEware", "text": "IVEware is software created by researchers at the Survey Methodology Program, Survey Research Center, Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan, to produce single or multiple imputations using SRMI as described in Raghunathan, et al., 2001. SRMI is a popular and well-understood methodology; a brief overview of the process follows to allow for comparison to ISR. Full technical details can be found in the previously noted paper. Unlike ISR, SRMI does not directly use the joint distribution of the variables requiring imputation. Instead, the joint distribution is induced from a conditional specification. Parameter estimates and deviates used for imputation are generated through a Gibbs sampling routine (Geman and Geman 1984;Gelfand and Smith 1990). After initialization of this routine, sets of parameter values are drawn iteratively and, for each set of parameter values, missing data are imputed based on a conditional model, where each conditional model may be linear or non-linear (e.g. generalized logit) in nature and a diffuse prior is used for the parameters. IVEware is available as a stand-alone program, or it can be run in SAS (SAS callable). Several modules are available to not only do imputation but to also conduct analysis of the data. For this study, the IMPUTE module was used. The IMPUTE module not only defines the model but also contains a host of other features that may be appealing to NASS. Some of the features of the IMPUTE model are defined below (see IVEware manual for full details). Within the IMPUTE module, the type of regression used can be determined by defining the variable type. Variable types that can be imputed include continuous, binary, categorical (polytomous with more than two categories), counts, and semi-continuous. All variables in the dataset are potentially used in each conditional model, unless indicated in the transfer statement. Hence, variables may not take on all of the roles allowed in the ISR program; therefore, some of the relationships preserved by the conditional models may not be preserved using IVEware. The imputer has options to utilize statements for model selection, such as step-wise regression, minimum R-squared, and maximum number of predictors. The user also has features to incorporate some types of edits, such as restrictions on variables to be imputed based on the value of other variables and bounded imputations. The user may opt to transform the data before imputing. IVEware is free, user-friendly, and easy to apply on a variety of data sources. Empirically, FCS methods, like those implemented in IVEware, have produced reasonable results (see Ragunathan, et al., 2001;Van Buuren et al., 2006;White and Reiter, 2008) with a high degree of variable flexibility and other desirable features for implementation by a statistical agency. However, the user accepts that convergence may not be reached due to a potential lack of a valid joint distribution. NASS has implemented IVEware for the 2014 Tenure, Ownership, and Transition of Agricultural Land (TOTAL) survey and plans to implement IVEware in the 2016 Local Food Marketing Practices Survey."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "The goal of this work is to compare the performances of ISR and IVEware using selected fully observed study variables from 2013 ARMS III, simulating missingness, and then imputing using both methods. The following two steps were conducted: 1. Simulation Study -Conduct a simulation study of IVEware using simulated missing values for ARMS III 2013 data and assess the performance of IVEware using analysis measures to be described. 2. Operational Study -Impute ARMS III data as in an operational setting using IVEware and ISR and compare the estimates based on the imputed data from the two approaches."}, {"section_title": "Simulation Study", "text": "Some of the variables are strongly correlated while others are weakly correlated. The study variables are listed in Table 2. For ARMS III, missing items eligible for imputation have been through an edit process that determines whether the value is zero or non-zero. Hence, in this first stage of the study, missing values are only imposed for non-zero values. From the population of fully observed respondents, 250 datasets were created with missing values under each of the missingness models. For each of the three selected variables and under each of the missingness models, approximately 30% of the nonzero values were removed from each dataset. We apply two IVEware imputation strategies, IVE_Direct and IVE_Trans, and one ISR strategy to ARMS III simulated datasets. Descriptions are in Table 3. IVEware applied without transformation of continuous variables.\nWe consider the differences in the mean estimates from the imputed datasets relative to the true mean from the observed data for FERTSEXP and EOY LIVESTOCK VALUE. Estimates made using single imputations."}, {"section_title": "IVE_Trans", "text": "IVEware applied with non-zero indicator created, zeros set to missing values (but replaced), and non-zero values transformed using log transformation. ISR ISR applied which includes a non-zero indicator created, zeros set to missing values (but replaced), and non-zero values transformed using described default transformation. For both of the IVEware applications, a MINRSQD option of 0.01 was used for the stepwise regression variable selection and bounds close to the 99 th percentile of the observed values in the population were used for FERTSEXP and EOY LIVESTOCK VALUE. MINRSQD refers to the minimum marginal r-squared for a stepwise regression. See Raghunathan et al. (2002) for more detail on IVEware options. For analysis, estimates were compared using the dataset containing all of the observed values to estimates from the imputed datasets. The differences in the means (proportion in the case of FARMTYPE) were examined.\nIVEware applied with non-zero indicator created, zeros set to missing values (but replaced), and nonzero values transformed using log transformation. Used two imputation groups. Approximately 150 variables out of over 800 variables collected on the ARMS III questionnaire were imputed for each year's dataset. The models change some from year to year. The models used for IVEware were as similar as possible to ISR in terms of eligible covariates. Both applications of IVEware only implemented bounds that reflected the support of the variable to be imputed. For example, a farm operation's farm service expenditures cannot be less than 0. Bounds were not placed to reflect other bounds written into the ARMS III edit, which may be an appealing feature to reduce the analysts' workload of editing the data after statistical imputation. Due to ISR's flexibility to allow multiple model groups to be run together but only some of the variables to be shared between model groups (see previous sections of this paper), we could not match this precisely."}, {"section_title": "Operational Application", "text": "For reference year 2013, ARMS III data were imputed using three imputation strategies: (1) ISR, (2) IVE_Direct, and (3) IVE_Trans. (See Table 4).  ), and nonzero values transformed using default described.\nRunning the IVEware imputation process on the ARMS III dataset revealed that IVEware did not always impute within the bounds set by the programmer. Imputed values outside the set bounds were noted in the log produced by IVEware; this occurred infrequently. Also, ISR was applied using five hundred iterations while IVEware was applied using ten iterations. Five hundred iterations was determined to be used for ISR applications from review of convergence diagnostics over applications of ISR to several years of ARMS III data. Even with some modifications to the workhorses (macros) of the IVEware software, IVEware failed to complete more than ten iterations on a consistent basis. Examining the mean estimates using a number of iterations between three and ten revealed little change across iterations. Moreover, most recommendations from the literature suggest no more than ten iterations for applications with moderate amounts of missingness, which is the case for most of the ARMS III variables. So, ten iterations for the IVEware models were used. Therefore, the run time for IVEware was significantly less than ISR (less than an hour versus eight hours). If results are similar, this would be a positive aspect of IVEware. We focused on estimates produced by NASS. In this paper, we highlight estimates that contain imputed data (Miscellaneous Capital Expenditures, Tax Expenditures (for property), and Total Expenditures). Figures 5-7 display the 95% confidence intervals for the difference in the estimates when imputing using ISR and IVEware. The midpoints and endpoints of the intervals were converted to show percent change in the estimate between the ISR and IVEware imputations (i.e., percent change = 100*(ISR-IVEware)/IVEware). Looking at the figures, we see that for Tax Expenditures (for property), where the number of values imputed are high, there is a significant difference for the estimate in all of the states. Further research revealed that this is due to the tendency of ISR to impute more extreme values than IVEware, and IVEware imputing values closer to the center of the distribution. Figure 5: 95% Confidence intervals for the difference between Total Expenditure estimates when imputing ARMS III data using ISR versus imputing using IVEware. The midpoints and endpoints of the intervals were converted to show percent change in the estimate between the ISR and IVEware imputations (i.e., percent change = 100*(ISR-IVEware)/IVEware).

We examined plots of the differences in the mean estimates relative to the true mean for each of the three estimates (FERTSEXP, EOY LIVESTOCK VALUE, FARMTYPE) with imputation using the three imputation methods (ISR, IVE_Trans, IVE_Direct) applied to the three types of missingess (MCAR, MAR, MNAR) (see Figure 3). Each boxplot represents the distribution of the relative differences for a given missingness condition and imputation method for the study variable. The horizontal line indicates a relative difference of zero and a boxplot centered on this line indicates no bias in the estimate. However, observing a tendency for the boxplot to be above or below the horizontal line indicates positive and negative bias, respectively. Overall, the performance of IVEware was best for FARMTYPE, the categorical variable in the study, and ISR was best for the semi-continuous variables FERTSEXP and EOY LIVESTOCK VALUE. If we consider the case where data are MAR (most often assumed in practice), not transforming the variables before imputation performed the best in terms of bias.  In addition to analyzing means, we also analyzed the ability of each imputation method to preserve the true correlations between each semi-continuous variable requiring imputation (Fertilizer Expenses and EOY Livestock Value) and a fully observed semi-continuous variable (Seed Expenses), which has a strong correlation to Fertilizer Expenses and a weak correlation to EOY Livestock Value (see Figure 4). A form of IVEware, either directly applied or applied after transformation, tended to perform best in most of the scenarios. Where bias exists, it is interesting to note that ISR tended to overstate relationships while IVEware tended to underestimate relationships."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Through our simulation study, we have found that IVEware performed better than ISR in terms of bias in the mean when imputing categorical variables in our study while ISR performed better with the semi-continuous variables in our study. Using IVEware, the relationship (correlation) for the variables in our study were better preserved. Where bias in the relationships (correlations) exist, IVEware understated the relationship while ISR overstated the relationship. The results of the operational study show that results using IVEware would not be similar when a large amount of the data are imputed using single imputation. Furthermore, we concluded that there is not enough evidence in this study to prioritize developing features already available in IVEware (e.g. use with categorical variables, bounded imputations, and restrictions) into ISR software in order to use ISR in additional NASS programs."}]
