[{"section_title": "Future Directions for Research on Human-Animal Interaction in an Aging Population", "text": "Nancy R. Gee * and Elizabeth Galik \u2020 that community-dwelling older adults are highly attached to their cats, tend to be younger and more educated than their non-pet owning peers, and are likely to benefit from their cat ownership experience. These two papers are solid stand-alone contributions of original research and therefore they are not specifically discussed below but are mentioned as they become relevant to the topics of discussion. Second, the series includes papers that introduce and describe the state of research, topics within the research area, and attributes of the research. Several papers in the issue discuss and highlight health benefits of pet ownership and/or HAI, as well as the mixed and null results associated with both. The content of these papers is discussed and synthesized. Third are papers that evaluate the strength and quality of the science in this research area. These papers, as well as this commentary, critically evaluate existing epidemiological and intervention research, and research on the effects of pet ownership or HAI on aging adults, and make specific recommendations for future research and the translation of that research into practical settings. The recommendations in these papers are also discussed below. Close examination of the papers in this thematic issue reveals the presence of two key cross-cutting themes: 1) the importance of companion animals in the lives of older adults, and 2) the limitations of previous research strategies and the need for more rigorous research. We organize the first portion of this concluding paper around these two themes, then present a discussion of the importance of ensuring the health and welfare of the animals involved, and finally address translating research findings into practice. Based on these observations, we make specific recommendations regarding best practices for inclusion of companion animals in the lives of older adults."}, {"section_title": "Importance of Companion Animals", "text": "A clear theme across this series of papers is the importance of companion animals in the lives of older adults. Nearly all the papers include impressive statistics regarding the ubiquitous nature of pet ownership in western society, specifically among older adults. Most of the papers mention the potential of companion animals to play a role in, or provide opportunities for, older adults to nurture, to enhance their diminishing social networks, and to maintain functioning (physical and cognitive) and quality of life into old age. Thorpe and Kelly-Moore describe a body of research that suggests that pets may improve a variety of health outcomes including chronic conditions. Krause-Parello, Gulik, and Basin (2019) summarize the overall health benefits of HAI, emphasizing the impact of them on mitigating the effects of loneliness and loss in an aging population. Additionally, they expand the discussion of HAI to include some of the positive effects of robotic animals on psychological outcomes for long-term care residents with cognitive impairment. In fact, all the papers in this issue cite research on the health benefits of animals to older adults, including measures of psychological (e.g., depression and anxiety) and physical health (cardiovascular disease and exercise). Wells (2019) presents a nicely balanced overview of this literature with an eye to the mixed results and a discussion of positive publication bias, while Enders-Slegers and Hediger (2019) review the benefits and explore the risks and challenges associated with pet ownership and interaction for older adults. The importance of companion animals seemingly cannot be undersold in the media. One only needs to open a newspaper, magazine, social media site, or watch a morning news show to find a human-interest story involving some aspect of HAI. Most of these tell a story of how animals are good for humans, and the public seems to readily accept this information as fact. Archaeological and genomic evidence indicate that humans and animals have been interacting for tens of thousands of years (Freedmanet al., 2014), but the evidence base supporting the claim that pets are good for people has been sparse, until recently. In recent years, there has been a steep increase in the number of HAI research studies (Herzog, 2014), due in large part to research funding coming from a key source. The role of the WALTHAM Centre for Pet Nutrition (a subsidiary of Mars Petcare) has been flagged as a key driving force behind much of this research, including the Public-Private Partnership with the National Institutes of Health (Thorpe & Kelly-Moore, 2019) and the recently established GSA/WALTHAM collaboration (Resnick & McCune, 2019). While academic organizations and private companies, such as WALTHAM, may have different philosophies of management and business, uniting their individual expertise into a mutual goal, such as providing opportunities to improve the methodology of HAI research, can prove beneficial to both groups. Additionally, these collaborations among academic and research organizations and private industry may become more important in a time when research funding is more limited."}, {"section_title": "Limitations of Previous Research Strategies and Recommendations for Future Research", "text": "Most of the papers in this themed issue report on the mixed findings in HAI research (Wells, 2019 provides many examples): in some studies pet owners, or people who interact with animals, experience an associated positive health outcome (e.g., reduction in blood pressure); in other studies pet ownership or interaction is not associated with a similar positive health outcome (no significant difference), or is associated with a negative health outcome (e.g., increase in blood pressure). Several of the papers attempt to provide potential explanations for these mixed results. In Krauss-Parello et al.'s review (2019), the potential confounding impact of the human handler on study outcomes is considered. (Friedmann et al. (2019) in their research address this methodological weakness by including an equally matched attention control group.) Gee and Mueller (2019) present a systematic review of the evidence in HAI and aging with a focus on the different outcomes based on pet ownership or pet interaction. In other words, does a person need to own a pet, or is interaction with a companion animal sufficient to reap any potential benefits? Overall this review concludes that the strongest evidence for the benefits of pets to people comes from animal-assisted intervention (AAI) research, and indicates that the research methodologies that compare older adults interacting with an animal with older adults interacting with a human (or some other control condition) provide the strongest and clearest evidence of the benefits of HAI. The pet ownership results are fewer in number, include more mixed or null results, and generally provide weaker evidence. Even so, most people still want to know if owning an animal is a healthy choice. Research on the topic of pet ownership has several inherent challenges. Arguably the biggest challenge is selection bias, in that pet owners self-select for pet ownership status; people want to decide for themselves whether to own a pet and if so, which species they prefer. They generally are not in favor of researchers randomly assigning them to a particular pet ownership status. Thus, it is challenging to separate out whether pet ownership makes people healthier or whether healthier people choose to own pets. Some studies do include random assignment of participants to conditions; this automatically provides a higher level of potential evidence by moving it from a quasi-experimental design to a true experimental design. However, in the general population it is likely that a greater number of people own pets than participate in animal-assisted interventions, so pet ownership studies are likely to be more broadly applicable to real world settings, something researchers will want to consider when taking an epidemiological approach. Thorpe and Kelly-Moore (2019) provide a critical review of epidemiological research involving companion animals and older adults, including a systematic review of pet ownership information that is publicly-available in existing population studies and could be accessed for research. The authors provide a table that interested researchers are likely to find helpful in identifying useful data sources, and they make clear recommendations regarding future research (which we highlight in our conclusions). In a recent methodological review paper, Friedmann and Gee (2018) evaluated and discussed a variety of other HAI research approaches investigating pet ownership, brief interactions with animals, and animal-assisted activities/interventions. In their candid discussion, several limitations involved in this research are reported, some of which echo the concerns raised by others in this thematic issue (e.g., Gee & Mueller, 2019;Thorpe & Kelly-Moore, 2019). For ease of consideration and accessibility we present a consolidated list of recommendations for future research on HAI and human aging, based on the limitations and suggestions noted by the authors in this thematic issue: Longitudinal Research Designs. Longitudinal research is needed because a cross-sectional approach does not permit the assessment of temporality, sequencing or ordering of events; this is important because life events may trigger pet ownership or the need to rehome a pet. Thorpe and Kelley-Moore (2019) make the important point that pets may not play the same role in a person's life over time; a longitudinal approach allows one to better understand the types of roles pets play at various life stages (trajectory of change) as well as their potential influence on the development and progression of chronic disease. Including HAI Questions in Existing Large-scale Panel Studies. As Thorpe and Kelly-Moore (2019) report, this has been done in studies like the Health and Retirement Study, but they suggest that these sorts of HAI modules should be included more widely in other studies such as the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA); we can now report that is in progress. A new study led by Erika Friedmann and funded by the WALTHAM Centre for Pet Nutrition has just placed an HAI module in the BLSA. At the time of this writing, the NICHD/Mars-WALTHAM Public Private Partnership is also in the process of adding an HAI module into the General Social Survey. We encourage researchers to include HAI questions in other large-scale panel studies, based on the clear advantage to adding such questionnaires to existing large (and expensive) populationbased studies. Given the ubiquitous nature of pet ownership in our society, it is heartening that these studies will now include at least some pet ownership-related questions. Deeper Exploration of Pet Attachment. Because the level or type of human attachment to, and involvement with, pets may be critical in determining if, or how, pets impact human health, it is important to include a reliable and valid measure of pet attachment and involvement in future research. Greater Numbers of Participants. Sufficiently large numbers should be included in studies to adequately power all measures. Many of the papers in this issue suggest the addition of biomarkers, such as, oxytocin or cortisol, in addition to observational and survey data. Robust Study Designs. Greater attention must be paid to research design, intervention length, and specifically to the inclusion of appropriate control conditions or comparison groups that Future Directions for Research on Human-Animal Interaction in an Aging Population are time equivalent. If the study involves a repeated measures design, then a balanced Latin Square is suggested to address the concern about carry-over effects. Confounding Variables. In epidemiological research, it is important to examine potential confounding variables in the data analysis, such as current and previous pet ownership status, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. In experimental designs, the use of random assignment to experimental conditions (especially when n > 30 in each condition) helps to eliminate the influence of confounding variables (Nolan & Heinzen, 2016). Greater Use of Theoretical Frameworks in Guiding Research. Future research should evaluate potential explanatory mechanisms for the relationships between pet ownership and human health across the lifespan. Defining Pet Ownership. Consistent definitions used across studies allow different study outcomes to be directly compared. Currently, pet ownership is a bit murky as a measure because people tend to respond in the affirmative that they are pet owners if a companion animal resides on their property, but that omits a lot of information. For example, the number or type of pets (e.g., cats, dogs, fish), who cares for the pet, whether the animal lives inside the house or outside, or how recently they acquired the pet. Accounting for Variations in Human Characteristics. Minority groups, immigrants, members of different cultures, and non-English speakers are underrepresented in HAI research and little is known about the impact of these human variations. Future research should seek a greater understanding of these and other important human characteristics. Novelty Effects. Intervention or experimental research in HAI is often subject to a novelty effect explanation. Researchers should consider the inclusion of a familiarization period, to adequately acquaint participants with the animal(s) to eliminate a novelty explanation. Defining the Interaction Procedurally. It is important for the purposes of replication and for understanding the nature of the effects related to specific kinds of interactions for researchers to clearly define the length and type of interaction that occurred between the human and the animal(s) in the study. Details should be provided on duration and frequency of interaction, and a clear description of the interactions in terms of specific human and animal behaviors. For example, did the human touch the dog? If so, how often and how long? Was the touch required by the experimenter or volunteered by the participant? Who initiated the contactperson or the dog? Additionally, researchers should present dose-response and cost-benefit analyses and provide information on the duration of effects seen. Variations in Animal Characteristics. Researchers need to state specific details related to the animal(s) involved in the study (e.g., description of temperament, breed, age, neuter status of the animal, training, certifications/registrations). To fully understand HAI, we must also attend to the animal side of the equation. What behaviors did the animal offer? Was there any evidence of stress (e.g., in dogs these may consist of behaviors like, yawning, lip licking, averting the eyes or turning the head away among others)? Measurement and Analysis. We recommend the use of standardized, well validated and reliable instruments in HAI research. In addition to the obvious benefits of using wellconstructed instruments in research (e.g., reduction in error/noise), the use of such measures allows for direct comparisons across research settings and participant types. As well, Friedmann and Gee (2018) suggest the use of several emerging methods such as eye and movement tracking devices, frequent monitoring of various biomarkers, the use of devices that monitor multiple variables in real time on both the human and the animal. Simultaneously monitoring the human and the animal during the interaction provides a more complete picture of what is going on and an opportunity to better understand the specific aspects of the interaction that may be linked to psychological or physiological health changes in specific situations. These types of measurements require the use of sophisticated statistical approaches applied appropriately to the data collected, which results from well planned and executed methods and procedures."}, {"section_title": "Ensuring the Health and Welfare of the Animals Involved", "text": "Several authors in this thematic issue note the importance of ensuring the wellbeing of animals involved in HAI research with older adults, as well as animals who reside with older adults living independently or participate in activities in residential facilities. Unfortunately, all too often the needs of this side of the HAI equation are over-looked. In their discussion of HAI in care facilities, Enders-Slegers and Hediger (2019) note the importance of establishing and ensuring animal welfare standards. There is little evidence to indicate that such facilities have routines or policies to address pet welfare concerns. The situation can be equally troubling for older pet owners who continue to live independently. Older adults are likely to have multiple medical comorbidities that could result in physical and functional disability that may limit their ability to interact with and care for their pets (Anderson et al., 2015). Conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart failure may result in physical activity intolerance, making it difficult to walk a dog. Osteoarthritis may impact mobility and other motor skills needed to care for a pet (lifting, carrying, and opening food). Visual deficits caused by macular degeneration, glaucoma, and other eye diseases may limit an older adult's ability to walk a dog or even drive a pet to veterinary appointments. Lastly, older adults with dementia who are living independently may lack the planning, organizational, and memory skills to safely care for a pet. These challenging circumstances are compounded when older adults' pets themselves age and require more medical attention and care. As Enders-Slegers and Hediger (2019) point out, owners' physical limitations can compromise their ability to carry pets who can no longer navigate stairs. Additionally, older pet owners are often faced with financial difficulties that can make pet-related expenses, particularly unexpected veterinary care, problematic. Less attention has been paid to the needs of animals directly involved in HAI research or in animal-assisted interventions. The respect for animals that drives this research should mandate that care protocols be developed and universally implemented for both research and interventions. Although all US university-based and federally funded research is subject to review by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), and similar requirements are in place in most other countries, standards are typically designed for laboratory animals and may not be appropriate for the animals involved in HAI research. Handlers must be trained not simply to respond to their animals' needs for food, water, and opportunities for elimination, but also to recognize signs of stress that may not be obvious. Taking this to the next step, research using wearable technology that monitors dogs' vital signs (Brugarolos et al., 2014) could advance our understanding of the indicators of dog stress in specific situations. Above all, interactions or data collection should not proceed at the expense of the wellbeing of the animal involved. The benefits of HAI should accrue to both parties."}, {"section_title": "Making the Transition-Practical Recommendations Supporting Pet Care Responsibilities in the Context of Disability", "text": "Fears and challenges of pet ownership for older adults need to be recognized and addressed, as proactive planning can help to prevent emergent situations for both older adults and their animal companions. Health care providers can incorporate a question about pet ownership as part of a patient's personal history. For older adults who are considering adopting or purchasing a pet, there are standardized assessments, such as the Dog Care Responsibility Inventory (Davis, 1987) and the Pet Expectations Inventory (Kidd, Kidd, & George, 1992) that can be used to explore expectations of pet ownership and readiness of the older adult to provide needed care for the pet. Additionally, for new pet owners, it is also helpful to match the pet type and temperament to the physical, emotional, and cognitive capability of the older adult. For example, an older woman who has osteoporosis, a history of a past hip fracture, and a fear of falls may want to avoid choosing an energetic puppy or young adult dog that may require a significant amount of exercise and may pull on a leash during walks outside. Instead, an older, well-trained dog or a cat may be a better option. Older pet owners should also consider enlisting family and friends who may be able to provide practical support when needed to compensate for disability, by for example delivering large bags of pet food or litter material to the older adult who is unable to lift heavy items, or providing a ride to the veterinary office for an older pet owner who in unable to drive. For older pet owners who do not have a local friend or family member available to assist, there are pet food and supply delivery programs, such as \"We All Love Our Pets\" program (WALOP). WALOP is an initiative paired with and supported by Meals on Wheels to provide delivery of pet food, as well as grooming and boarding, to homebound older adults in some communities."}, {"section_title": "Addressing Financial Concerns", "text": "A significant challenge for older pet owners is the financial expense of caring for a pet, particularly as many older adults live on a fixed budget. Pet deposit fees are typically charged to tenants of rental housing and are a significant financial barrier for low income older adults who otherwise may be willing to adopt or foster a shelter animal (Anderson et al., 2015). US housing regulations require that pets be permitted in public or publicly subsidized housing if the owner is capable of caring for the pet. Unfortunately, not all older adults have access to public housing or find public housing to be desirable. In the United States, there are some programs, typically associated with local animal shelters, that offer low-cost spay/neuter clinics, microchipping, and vaccination programs to clients who qualify as low income. There are also a variety of charitable organizations that provide veterinary and pet care assistance funds, such as the Dog & Cat Cancer Fund (http://www.dccfund.org), the Pet Fund (http://www.thepetfund.com), Diabetic Cats in Need (http://fdmb-cin.blogspot.com/), and the Magic Bullet Fund (http://themagicbulletfund.org/). In addition to assistance with spay/neutering, STARelief and Pet Assistance offers a Pet Food Pantry that may offer short-term assistance to private pet owners who are unemployed or receiving disability or social security benefits (http://starelief.org/). While pet ownership may be perceived as the ideal mechanism for pet interaction by older adults, there are alternative opportunities to support HAI outside of pet ownership. Options include volunteering at a local animal shelter, serving as a foster care home for an adoptable pet, pet sitting, attendance at senior centers that support and provide opportunities for animal-assisted activities, and routine pet visits by family and friends. Enders-Slegers and Hediger (2019) describe a program in the Netherlands that matches older adults wishing to foster with dogs that need \"day care.\""}, {"section_title": "Confronting the Inevitable-Future Planning about Pet Welfare", "text": "Older adults living with pets are all too often burdened with the fear of what will become of their pet when they themselves die, and concerns over how they will cope with the sadness that will accompany the death of their pet. Family members and health care providers can assist older pet owners in managing anxiety and developing a plan in the event that the pet outlives the capabilities or life of its owner. A family or friend may be agreeable to adopting the pet. A will stipulates the distribution of assets and property; however, it is an inadequate solution for ongoing pet care due to challenges of enforceability and the possibility of a prolonged probate. Another alternative is the development of a pet trust, which is often part of estate planning. A pet trust will identify a pet guardian who will care for the pet if the owner is too ill to provide continued care or dies, and may also include funding to use for the care of the pet (Hirschfeld, 2009). Enders-Slegers and Kruger (2018) suggest a pet protection agreement as a less expensive alternative. In addition, if finances are limited, shelters and breeders may agree to return of the pet."}, {"section_title": "Managing Anxiety about Outliving a Pet and Dealing with Loss", "text": "While there are some resources and literature that focus on planning for pet welfare when an older adult becomes disabled or dies, there is far less about the fear and anxiety that many older pet owners have about outliving their pet. Enders-Slegers and Kruger (2018) note that this fear is often cited as a reason given by older adults for not owning a pet. Even though older adults undergo repeated losses as they age and clinically may develop fear and anxiety related to the prospect of the death of a companion animal, or complicated grief following the death of a pet, there is little information about these phenomena in the research literature. Future research should explore the extent of fear and anxiety that older adults have about outliving their companion animals and address preparatory and counseling strategies to deal with these feelings, as well as to assist older adults to better deal with bereavement following the death of a companion animal."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The importance of animals in the lives of older adults is apparent from the ubiquity of pet ownership among that population. However, we have much to learn about how, when, and under what conditions companion animals may be beneficial to the psychological or physical health of older adults. The papers in this thematic issue explore the available evidence, discuss the mixed findings, and consider the limitations of HAI research with older adults. In this concluding paper, we have highlighted recommendations to guide future researchers' approaches to design and implementation. We have discussed the importance of the health and welfare of the animals and made suggestions for formulating a translational pipeline for research to practice. The level of awareness of the importance of pets in the lives of older adults has risen dramatically in recent decades, and solutions to the accompanying challenges are continually evolving. These may take the form of community responses, support from family members, or increases in the availability of pet-permitted housing or residential pet programs. Additionally, it is important for health care providers to recognize the significant impact that pets may have on the physical and emotional health of older adults and begin to assess both the benefits and potential challenges of pet ownership among their older patients. Future solutions can be guided by effective research, and incorporating the ideas in this themed issue will be an important component."}]
