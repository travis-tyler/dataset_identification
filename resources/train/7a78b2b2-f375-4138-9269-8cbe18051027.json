In parietal and frontal cortices of the most affected hemisphere we found also grey matter loss (P < 0.05), increased mean diffusivity (P < 0.05) and decreased fractional anisotropy (P < 0.05) in CBS patients compared to healthy controls and MCI patients. Grey matter loss and white matter changes in the precentral gyrus of CBS patients were associated with worse motor symptoms.

The clinical diagnostic accuracy of CBS is poor due to the overlapping clinical features with other neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), progressive supranuclear pPalsy (PSP) and tau-positive forms of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Only 25-56% of cases are correctly diagnosed antemortem [3] . Therefore, diseaserelated patterns of pathology that could be assessed in vivo with non-invasive procedures such as neuroimaging could aid accurate diagnosis, provide neuropathological insight and help in assessing response of disease-modifying treatments.\nRecently, PET with specific radioligands binding to aggregated tau has provided a unique opportunity to assess tau pathology in living humans [4] . Autoradiography studies with post-mortem human tissue have shown that [ 18 F]AV1451 selectively binds to hyperphosphorylated tau over amyloid-\u03b2 plaques [5] . [ 18 F]AV1451 binds with higher affinity to paired helical filaments of 3R over 4R tau isoforms; however, autoradiography studies in post-mortem tissue have shown specific binding in patients with CBS [5] [6] [7] . Recently, an in vivo [\n18 F]AV1451 PET study has shown increased tau uptake in the motor cortex, corticospinal tract, and basal ganglia in the hemisphere contralateral to the most affected body side of six patients with CBS compared to healthy controls and patients with AD and PSP [8] . Another [ 18 F]AV1451 PET study has demonstrated increased tau binding in the putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus and precentral grey and white matter in the hemisphere contralateral to the clinically most affected side in six CBS patients [9] . Previous MRI studies have shown grey matter loss and white matter changes in precentral, superior frontal, and fusiform gyri, putamen and globus pallidus in CBS patients [10, 11] .\nHowever, these neuroimaging studies are limited by the small sample size, commonly assessing a handful of CBS patients, the use of a single imaging modality lack of arterial input function for assessing [ 18 F]AV1451 binding and the lack of any evidence for confirmation of in vivo findings at the histopathological level. Moreover, there is additional scientific advantage regarding neuroimaging potential by comparing disease-related patterns of in vivo pathology in patients with CBS to early stages of AD such as in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD.\nIn this study, by using multimodal PET and MR neuroimaging, we sought to identify disease-related patterns of in vivo pathology of tau aggregates using [ 18 F]AV1451 PET, amyloid-\u03b2 deposition with [ 18 F]AV45, grey matter and white matter microstructural changes with 3-T MRI, in a group of patients with CBS compared to age-matched healthy controls and a group of patients with MCI due to AD.

The MIAKAT\u2122 processing pipeline was followed, ensuring that all quality control steps were completed. All patients with CBS and the healthy controls scanned at Imanova underwent arterial sampling for measurements of radioactivity concentrations.

Our findings derive from in vivo assessments of molecular and structural pathology following PET and MRI, which are consistent with observations from histopathological studies [2] . We also present one case, who underwent both the in vivo imaging study and histopathological examination of brain biopsy, and confirmed co-localisation of increased PET tau signal and tau pathology in the parietal cortex of the affected hemisphere contralateral to the clinically most affected side providing with additional validation of our findings.\nOur study follows three recent pilot studies which assessed tau pathology with either the same [\n18 F]AV1451 PET radioligand [8, 9] we used, or with the [ 18 F]THK5351 PET radioligand [26] . Our findings are in line and extend the preliminary observations from these studies that showed frontal and parietal tau pathology in brain areas including the precentral, postcentral and superior frontal and superior parietal gyri in patients with CBS. These previous studies, however, have been limited in scope due to limited sample size and not assessing some other important elements of pathology such as grey and white matter microstructural changes. Our study comes with the significant advantages that our group of patients with CBS was double the size of that used in previous pilot studies; the depth of assessments including thorough clinical and neurophysiological evaluation, and multimodal tau and amyloid-\u03b2 molecular and volumetric and microstructural assessment of molecular and structural pathology in vivo; the comparisons with large sized cohorts of healthy individuals, but also patients with MCI due to AD, and in one case the concurrent tau and amyloid-\u03b2 PET imaging and histopathological examination of brain biopsy.\nAnother advantage of our study was to validate SUVRs against arterial input function method for quantification of [ 18 F]AV1451 uptake is most commonly measured using semi-quantitative SUVRs [28] [29] [30] with the cerebellum as the reference region for no tau-specific [ 18 F]AV1451 uptake [19] . SUVRs have several advantages over computational analysis with plasma input functions, including shorter scan duration, with static scans targeting a specific time window, reduced likelihood of head movement and simplified and quick analysis method. Furthermore, quantitative of static imaging with SUVRs static imaging has greater potential for clinical applications. Here, we show no differences in results at a group level when using SUVR or Logan DVR values. Therefore, supporting previous work [14, 27] , [ 18 F]AV1451 can be analysed without the need for arterial sampling and compartmental modelling. Static imaging with SUVRs provides a reliable method for the regional quantification of tau burden in patients with CBS.\nThe region-of-interest analysis we performed showed increases in tau deposition in the superior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, superior parietal gyrus, postcentral gyrus, angular gyrus and putamen in the hemisphere contralateral to the clinically most affected side. These findings were also confirmed at voxel level. Moreover, we found that increases in cortical tau pathology co-localised with cortical grey matter loss and white matter microstructural changes. It is likely that abnormal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated 4R tau may cause neuronal loss and white matter axonal loss. Tau pathology is also found in white matter as neuropil threads and oligodendroglial coiled bodies in CBS postmortem tissue [2] . Smith et al. suggested that cortical atrophy is more pronounced and widespread compared to cortical [ 18 F]AV1451 deposition in CBS patients [8] . However, this observation was not confirmed in our larger group of CBS patients. Moreover, it may be possible that the amount of tau pathology visualised with [\n18 F]AV1451 is lower than expected because of the low affinity of this radioligand for 4R tau protein.\nIt has been suggested that [\n18 F]AV1451 selectively binds to paired helical filaments 3R characteristic of AD and less avidly to the straight tau filaments 4R typical of non-AD tauopathies such as CBS and PSP [5, 6] . Our histopathological data, however, support that the cortical increases observed in [ [31, 32] . Increases in midbrain and basal ganglia [\n18 F]AV1451 uptake were also shown found in other 4R tauopathies such as PSP [33] [34] [35] and in MAPT p.R406W mutation carriers [36] .\nCBS pathology affects also subcortical nuclei such as striatum, globus pallidus and substantia nigra [2] . We found significant increases in tau deposition in the putamen in the hemisphere contralateral to the most affected side in CBS patients. Neuropathological and autoradiographic data have suggested that [ 18 F]AV1451 exhibits off-target binding to neuromelaninand melanin-containing neurons in subcortical nuclei [5] . However, a recent [ 18 F]AV1451 PET study showed increased uptake in the basal ganglia and midbrain of PSP patients in absence of post-mortem neuromelanin-containing cells [34] . Given that this is still a subject of debate we will not provide interpretation and mechanistic speculation about our findings in putamen.\nIn our study, we compared imaging data from the group of patients with CBS to a group of patients with MCI due to AD, in addition to the group of healthy controls. The patients with MCI showed significant tau retention in the anterior, middle, inferior temporal lobe, parahippocampal gyrus and fusiform gyrus compared to the group of healthy controls. These findings reflect the distribution of tau pathology consistent with Braak stage III-IV, which involves hippocampus and the [37] . Compared to patients with CBS, patients with MCI displayed significant increases in tau deposition in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus and anterior temporal gyrus; whereas patients with CBS showed increases in tau deposition in precentral and postcentral gyri in the affected hemisphere. This suggests different disease-specific patterns of tau pathology in CBS patients and MCI patients, with the former involving the primary motor and primary somatosensory cortices of the hemisphere contralateral to the clinically affected side of the body.\nAll our CBS patients had normal cortical and subcortical amyloid-\u03b2 retention indicating the absence of typical AD pathology. This was also confirmed in the case of the patient with CBS who underwent histopathological examination of brain biopsy. As expected, MCI patients showed increased amyloid-\u03b2 deposition across several temporal and parietal areas consistent with previous studies [38] .\nWe found that increased tau deposition in the medial frontal and postcentral gyri contralateral to the clinically most affected side was associated with worse performance at the Rapid Visual Information Processing test, which measures attention. The medial frontal cortex plays a key role in performance monitoring on subsequent trials and in the implementation of associated adjustments in cognitive control [39] , whereas the somatosensory area has been commonly involved in the execution of visual motor task, which require sustained attention [40] . A recent in vivo [ 18 F]AV1451 PET study showed that increased tau uptake in the precentral grey and white matter was associated with worse motor functions as measured by the UPDRS-III and this correlation was drive by bradykinesia and axial motor subscores [9] . We did not find associations between motor symptoms severity and increased tau deposition. This discrepancy may be due to the small sample size investigated by Cho et al., [9] who interrogated correlations between tau and clinical symptoms only in six CBS patients. Moreover, the lack of a validated scale to assess motor symptoms in CBS may have also contributed to this difference.\nMRI analysis showed disease-related patterns of grey and white matter changes in CBS and MCI patients. We found significant grey matter loss in the precentral, supramarginal and middle frontal gyri in the hemisphere contralateral to the clinically most affected body side of the patients with CBS compared to healthy controls and patients with MCI. Microstructural white matter changes were also observed in frontal and parietal cortices in the hemisphere contralateral to the clinically most affected body side of patients with CBS compared to healthy controls and patients with MCI. This is in line with previous studies showing significant asymmetric regional grey matter loss and white matter changes in motor cortex areas [10, 11] .\nWe found significant associations between grey matter loss and white matter changes in the precentral gyrus in the hemisphere contralateral to the clinically most affected side and hand rigidity, bradykinesia and apraxia of the affected clinical body side. The clinical core features of CBS include asymmetric rigidity, bradykinesia and apraxia characteristically affecting the upper limbs [41] . This suggests that grey and white matter structural changes in the primary motor cortex are associated with worse clinical symptoms in CBS. We measured motor symptoms severity using both the UPDRS-III and PSPRS since to date there is not a validate clinical rating scale for CBS.\nIn conclusion, our findings demonstrate the identification of an in vivo disease-related pattern of asymmetric frontal and parietal tau and microstructural pathology in the absence of amyloid-\u03b2, which distinguishes CBS from non-affected individuals and patients with MCI due to AD. Our results are confirmed at a histopathological level and support the use of [ 18 F]AV1451 PET as a marker of tau pathology in CBS patients. Clinical diagnosis of CBS could be difficult due to the overlapping features with other neurodegenerative disorders, in vivo imaging of tau aggregates with PET has the potential to aid in the differential diagnosis of CBS. Since also prevention of tau aggregation and propagation is the focus of attempts to develop mechanism-based treatments for tauopathies our multimodal image approach could also serve as an indicator of treatment efficacy for interventions aimed at preventing tau aggregate formation.
