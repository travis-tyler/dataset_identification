The community density remained stable, fluctuating around a mean value of 403 \u00b1 85 territories/km 2 . Species richness increased by an average of one species every four years. Twenty species made up 98% of the community and Phylloscopus trochilus (40%) and Fringilla montifringilla (19%) remained the dominant species. The species turnover rate between successive seasons was on average 30%. The mean temperatures in June and July were positively correlated to the community density two years and one year later, respectively, less so for the densities of the individual species. Fringilla montifringilla increased in density during the first two years of each Epirrita autumnata caterpillar outbreak, whereas the other species responded only weakly or not at all. All species tended to fluctuate in parallel (no significant opposite trends) which together with the other results suggests that the investigated bird community is far from saturated."}, {"section_title": "Contents", "text": "The composition and density of the bird fauna 74\nEpirrita autumnata dynamics 75\nEnvironmental temperature 75 Analyses and discussion 75\nThe composition of the passerine bird community 76\nNumber of species 76\nSpecies turnover 77\nThe density fluctuations of the total community 77\nThe influence of environmental temperature on the total community 80 Fluctuations in the species populations 81\nEnvironmental temperature and species density fluctuations 83\nInfluence of the Epirrita autumnata outbreaks 85\nThe relations between the density fluctuations of the species 88\nFluctuations of the short-distance versus longdistance (tropical) migrants 89\nLong-term trends versus short-term fluctuations 89\nExamples of strengths and weaknesses of longterm bird census work 91"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Having analysed the classical census works by e.g. Palmgren (1930) and Merikallio (1946) and having observed the appearance of more efficient census methods, Lauri Siivonen (1948) pointed to the possibility of designing investigations to follow shortterm fluctuations in passerine bird populations. At that time the censuses had mainly aimed at describing the composition of the bird communities and the regional distribution of the species populations. Thereafter population fluctuation studies soon developed into one of the main streams in the field investigations on birds, although some initiatives had been taken place at a much earlier stage (Kendeigh 1982) . This highlighted the need for long-term investigations aimed at discovering long-term trends in bird densities, which would also provide sufficient data that might help to identify communitycontrolling factors. The latter expectation has been only partly fulfilled and the interpretations are controversial. After reviewing the field, Wiens (1989a, b) recommended to continue to examine how communities vary in nature by approaching the patterns of variation as something of interest in their own right. From the outset this has constituted the guideline for our project, which has provided a great deal of descriptive information regarding the bird fauna in the subalpine birch forests in Swedish Lapland. The density figures for the passerine populations over the first 37 years are presented and analysed from selected aspects in this report.\nLong-term bird census studies are not easy. Only a few have been published that were carried out over a period of at least 20 years without interruptions and that cover study areas of about one square kilometre or more, using tested census techniques. Apart from the earlier reports based on the first 20 years of our project (Enemar et al. 1984 , Svensson et al. 1984 , two long-term census investigations which meet the above-mentioned requirements have been carried out in deciduous forests. They are a 20-year study (1975) (1976) (1977) (1978) (1979) (1980) (1981) (1982) (1983) (1984) (1985) (1986) (1987) (1988) (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) in Bialowieza National Park (BNP) in Poland (Wesolowski & Tomialojc 1997 ) extended by five years by Wesolowski et al. (2002) , and a 30-year census , albeit in a rather small study plot, in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Area, New Hampshire, USA (Holmes & Sherry 2001) .\nIt is well known that the weather conditions are rather unpredictable in the far north and that they may shift dramatically within as well as between seasons. One weather factor, the environmental temperature, has been chosen and related to the dynamics of the bird community and of individual species. A regularly occurring dramatic event in the study area is the cyclic appearance of masses of the lepidopteran caterpillars Epirrita autumnata, which creates a superabundant food situation at approximately ten-year intervals (Sel\u00e5s et al. 2001 ). Thus, a census of birds as well as of the caterpillars must extend over several decades in order to permit a reliable analysis of the effect of the outbreaks on the community density."}, {"section_title": "Introductory statements", "text": "A long-term bird census investigation is a formidable undertaking, involving a great deal of intrinsic problems that have been identified and discussed for many years, regarding e.g. use of concepts, choice of space and time scaling of the field work, in addition to the special problems of long-term project funding. The situation of our investigation in relation to these matters is described below as a background to the subsequent descriptions and discussions.\n1) The community concept has long been controversial. Wiens (1980) presented a summary of factors that make the concept hazardous to use. He concluded that it is difficult to establish that communities (e.g. passerine bird communities) exist in any functional sense, as they are represented by a number of independent or interacting species populations within a selected area or habitat of varying size and over varying lengths of time. Newton (1998) and other reviewers support this opinion. Underwood (1986) argued that communities are not readily identifiable in nature and that the tendency is to replace the term \"community\" with \"assembly\". However, McIntosh (1995) found that \" the recent work perpetuates the original dichotomy between integrated community concept and individualistic non-integrated concept\". Due to the confusion of diverse opinions, we wish to stress that we use the term community to refer to the bird populations in our study area without considering to whether or not they represent a functional entity.\n2) The need for long-term bird census work has been stressed for many years (e.g. Wiens 1977 , J\u00e4rvinen 1980 . Franklin (1989) listed the reasons in detail. The unavoidable question about how long a long-term study should be has also been put forward. A number of suggestions have been made, based on e.g. the average life-span of the birds, cyclic processes in the habitat, and identification and frequency of unusual events (Wiens 1977 , Calder III 1984 Andersson. et al. 1985 , Wiens et al. 1986 , Weatherhead 1986 ). We believe that our 37-year census period is long enough to avoid the most obvious risks of data distortion and misinterpretations, even when taking into account the 10 to 11-year cycles of the lepidopteran caterpillar outbreaks. Several of our analyses were carried out for periods of different length in order to illustrate the effect of varying temporal scales of investigation.\n3) The study area is large enough (9 km 2 ) to permit a fairly safe characterisation of the yearly density and composition of the bird fauna of the subalpine birch forest (cf. Wiens 1981) .\n4) The birch forest is almost exclusively primeval. This is an advantage because the effect of continuous habitat change can be more or less excluded as a factor to be considered in the interpretations and analyses. Our study area shares its primeval state with the census plots in the above-mentioned BNP.\n5) Several authors have mentioned the problem of funding long-term census investigations. This problem is caused, among other things, by the fact that planned dissertation projects at universities should not take longer than about four years and that the sponsors favour projects that have the potential to deliver valuable results within a relatively short time. By necessity, therefore, the present census in the subalpine birch forests is part of a long-term project (the LUVRE-project) that has no permanent or formal connection to any university department, i.e. it is free from imperative directives to adapt to current research trends and from demands for frequent production of high quality publications. This longterm, continuous investigation has been, and still is, exclusively based on the dedicated interest and curiosity of staff members, amateurs and university people alike, who for the most part participate despite only meagre financial compensation, if any, for their travel and living expenses related to their field work. The theme of the project has been and still is: A series of biological annual censuses never reaches the point that justifies its cessation."}, {"section_title": "The study area", "text": "The study area covers 9 km 2 of mountain birch forest on the south-facing slopes of the Gaisatj (Kaissats) and Valle mountains near the small village of Ammarn\u00e4s in Swedish Lapland. It extends from the Raurejukke stream in the west to the Karsb\u00e4cken stream in the east and its southern border consists of Lake Stor-Tjultr\u00e4sket and the road from this lake to Ammarn\u00e4s (Figure 1 ).

Scattered small bogs are also found within the area. On the whole the forest can be considered primeval and partly consists of tall birches of considerable age. New birches sprout where old trees have fallen. Spontaneous thinning of the forest into dwarf-shrub heath due to habitat transformation (Kullman 1981) has not been observed, and the Epirrita caterpillar outbreaks have only killed a few scattered birches locally. Taken as a whole, therefore, the impression is that the habitat of the investigated area has remained constant throughout the 37-year study period, showing no radical transformation of any kind ( Figure  3) .\nThe study area has of course been exposed to diffuse and indirect effects of human activities, such as acidified precipitation, which may cause slow and easily over-looked changes in the habitat quality. In fact, egg shell defects and abnormally small clutches have appeared in the nests of a number of small passerines, apparently induced by air-pollution (Nyholm 1981) . As this disturbance is mainly confined to the birds breeding within 100 m of the shore-line of the lake Stor-Tjultr\u00e4sket, it is considered to have only an insignificant effect on the bird community dynamics as a whole."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The bird census", "text": "The bird census work started in 1963 and has continued without interruption ever since, for two to three weeks in June during the breeding season. Two methods have been applied: 1) territorial mapping in restricted study plots of known size, and 2) line transects traversing the whole study area. The scope of the fieldwork as well as information about the census-takers can be seen in Tables 1-3 .\nThe mapping and evaluation of territory densities were carried out in accordance with international recommendations (Anon. 1970) . Most passerine species in the birch forest establish more or less distinct territories that usually appear as observation clusters on the species maps. A borderline case is the, at times, semi-colonial Carduelis flammea, which moves around calling and singing over at wide area even during the breeding season. However, mapping the alighting positions after the song-flights combined with other breeding indications have provided interpretable species maps. The Turdus species, especially the colonial ones, are more difficult to map and have therefore been censused by nest counts.\nLine transecting means that the observer walks along tracks running all over the 9 km 2 of the study area, noting all birds heard or seen, predominantly singing males, which might indicate the presence of a territory. The unlimited distance recording technique has been adopted, as it is next to impossible to estimate the location of and distance from a bird that is heard but not seen (cf. the IPA-method worked out by Blondel et al. (1981) ). The tracks used have differed over years although the majority have been followed every season. As the size of the area covered by the observer is unknown, the line transect data are only used to calculate the relative abundance of the species, i.e. their proportion of the total number of observations. It is extremely important that the fieldwork of each census-taker is strictly standardised. A total number of at least 1500 observations is required to record the fluctuations of the sparsely occurring species (down to a relative abundance of about 2%, Enemar & Sj\u00f6strand 1967) . On average, this means a total of about 30 hours of transect work carried out along an 80-km track. The minimum number of observations was not achieved in the first two seasons."}, {"section_title": "Calculating the density index of the bird species", "text": "The data from the study plots provide a fairly reliable information about the density change between years of the total bird community and of the populations of the most abundant species. The yearly fluctuations in the plots are in reasonable accordance with those of the total study area (Enemar & Sj\u00f6strand 1970) . However, this does not apply to the majority of the species, because they are too few in numbers in relation to the total size of the mapped study plots. Due to chance, the density figures of these sparsely occurring species may deviate significantly from those of the larger study area (cf. Rotenberry & Wiens\u00b4 (1980) \"checkerboard effect\"). Much larger study plots should be mapped so as to avoid this \"sampling error\". This is not possible for practical reasons, such as the fact that the mapping is a highly time-consuming work (the plots must be mapped ten times each season). As the main aim of this investigation has been to record the dynamics of the species populations, the problem of the rare species has been solved, at least to some extent, by using the relative abundance data from the line transects. However, these figures are of no use on their own, as they depend not only on the density change of the actual species but also on that of all other species in the community. Therefore they have been combined with the density of the bird community as obtained from the study plots, resulting in a so-called derived density index for each species. This index was introduced by Enemar & Sj\u00f6strand (1970) , who developed and improved a similar census method invented and applied in the same habitat many years ago by Klinckowstr\u00f6m (1909) .

Corvidae were excluded because they could not be mapped in a reliable way. They are few. Nesting Corvus corone was established in the study plots only twice during the 37-year period. The thrushes were excluded because of their tendency to breed in colonies, which may seriously bias the dynamics of the study plot density compared to that of the total study area.

The relative abundance of insects on the birches has been estimated in three permanent plots, 50x50 m in size, located on the south-facing slopes of the Gaisatj and Valle mountains. The fieldwork began when the birch leaves were new, normally during the third week of June, and continued for about two weeks. Each plot was investigated six times by examining, on each occasion, 1000 short shoots and counting all insects, spiders and mites. No specimens were collected, which means that they were only ranged under a group (individual species not identified). An exception was the geometrid moth Epirrita autumnata, which was dealt with separately. The relative abundance is expressed as the mean number of animals per 1000 short shoots."}, {"section_title": "Environmental temperature", "text": "The daily temperature of the Ammarn\u00e4s area has been measured mostly on a local basis.

A summary of characteristics is given in Table 5 and in the section dealing with the possible influences of temperature on the bird numbers."}, {"section_title": "Statistics", "text": "Most of the calculations are based on time series, which means that the population numbers are not independent because the population size in any given year is partly dependent on the number of birds present during the preceding season. Correlation and regression tests have nevertheless been applied to the figure data mainly because they are an efficient and straightforward way to present condensed information about the dynamic processes that have occurred in the study area. Strictly speaking, this means that the routinely presented levels of probability are not always reliable. The statistical tests used are all two-tailed: two-sample t-tests, X 2 -test, correlation and regression, mainly in line with Bonnier & Tedin (1940) ."}, {"section_title": "Census material quality", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Birds", "text": "As stressed by Wiens (1989a) , it is of utmost importance that the methods applied in bird census investigations are clearly defined and that the source of any errors are identified and evaluated. A particular problem related to long-term projects is that changes of census-takers are unavoidable in the long run. This means the introduction of a personal margin of error, which cannot be fully eliminated no matter how well trained or how faithful to the standardised census technique a new census-taker is. Therefore three experiments have been performed in the actual birch forests to investigate these and related problems.\n1. As the derived density index is the main parameter used in this study, it is of interest to know to what degree the mapping censuses capture the total number of territories within the plots. When the territories were represented by identified nests they exceeded the mapped territories by only 4.5%, although there were clear species differences (Enemar et al. 1976) . Moreover, the number and positions of mapped territories accorded well with the actual number of territories of an abundant species, Phylloscopus trochilus, estimated with the aid of playback and colour ringing (Enemar et al. 1979) . This indicates that the territory density, as obtained by mapping, is not very far from the real one in the plots and that it shows the direction of the yearly changes of the community density with reasonable reliability.\n2. Four observers mapping the same study plot over two seasons obtained similar results, showing that one competent census-taker can replace another one, providing that the same procedure is strictly applied when evaluating the species maps (Enemar et al. 1978) . Apparently, the quality differences that exist between even competent observers are largely eliminated due to the ten-fold reiteration of the mapping procedure in each plot.\n3. The proportional distribution of the species in the line transect samples may differ significantly between observers (Enemar & Sj\u00f6strand 1967) . Obviously, this bias cannot be eliminated by taking larger line transect samples. Therefore comparisons between seasons in terms of the relative abundance values should be based on the field data of the same census-taker(s). To increase the chances of fulfilling this requirement, usually two observers worked on a complete transect every year (Table 3) . The recorded relative abundance values have a certain bias because the species differ in conspicuousness. The deviations from the true values of the figures obtained during the line transect work are species specific as are the derived density indices.\nFicedula hypoleuca is abundant in the nest-boxes erected for experimental purposes within a small section of the study area. It has been included only in those line transects performed outside the nest-box areas.\nIn summary, the census work and the derived density index described above have only been applied in this investigation to obtain a fairly reliable registration of the fluctuation patterns of the species populations and the total community over quite large areas. It is absolutely essential to cover a study area of several square kilometres in size in habitats where the majority of the species are sparse, such as in the subalpine birch forest. The fluctuation pattern of the density indices of the species populations and the total community is mainly based on the information from the line transects, where non-territorial birds are counted together with the territorial ones in unknown proportions. The derived density figures will therefore differ from the study plot densities to a varying degree depending on e.g. the conspicuousness and general frequency of the species."}, {"section_title": "Insects", "text": "Only four persons have taken part in the insect census work since 1967 (Table 4 ).

The duration of the outbreaks, counted as the number of years with ten or more caterpillars per 1000 short shoots, is five, four, and four years, respectively.

The turnover (T) has been calculated, as a percentage, according to the generally used formula T=100(I+E)/ [0.5(S1+S2)t], where I and E are the number of immigrating and emigrating species, S1 and S2 the number of species present in the first and second season, respectively, and t is the number of years between the compared seasons.\nThe species turnover between successive seasons (t=1) varied between 8% and 37% with a mean value of 30 \u00b1 8.7%(S.D.) and showed no significant trend over the 37-year period (Figure 8 ).\nThe species turnover rate increased in line with the number of years between the compared seasons, from 20-25% to around 45% ( Figure 9 ). This increase is partly a consequence of the upward trend in the annual number of species (Figure 8 ). It particularly affects the turnover rates over the longest time intervals because they are mainly based on the figures from the first (species-poor) and last (species-rich) parts of the investigated period.\nThirty species have been absent one season or more. The mean number of these irregularly occurring species per season is slightly more than eleven. Given that two compared seasons shared no such species, the calculated species turnover would be about 80%. The latter figure may indicate an order of magnitude of \"maximum average turnover rate\". The calculated values of even the longest intervals are far from approaching this level ( Figure 9 ). It is noteworthy that there is no indication of a downward trend towards the end of the diagram as observed in long-term investigations elsewhere (Svensson et al. 1984 , Enemar et al. 1994 ).\nIncreasing turnover rates following longer intervals between compared seasons were found by Jones & Diamond (1976) , Diamond & May (1977) and Abbott (1978) . Their findings are similar to those of Bengtsson et al. (1997) who also showed that the community variability increases over time. Thus the time scale must thus be taken into account when comparing the variability of different communities. "}, {"section_title": "The density fluctuations of the total community", "text": "It is well known that the densities of the separate species may fluctuate more in the northern areas than in the southern ones (e.g. J\u00e4rvinen 1979), which is true also for Ammarn\u00e4s ( Figure 5 ). As expected, the mean annual density change of the total community is less pronounced with a CV of 21%, which is much less than the mean CV, 65%, of the 20 most frequently occurring passerine species. Nevertheless, according to a heterogeneity test, the density of the community varies highly significantly (\u03c7 2 = 632, p < 0.001). The lowest densities amount to less than 50% of the maximum levels (density indices 236 and 564, respectively, Figure 4 ). The community fluctuation can be compared with that of the deciduous woods of the BNP in Poland, i.e. 13 degrees of latitude further south. Wesolowski & Tomialojc (1997) report that the highest density recorded exceeds the minimum density by about 44%, and that the maximum increase between two successive seasons amounts to 13%. The corresponding figures in our study area are 139% and 60%. Clearly the fluctuation amplitude is higher further north.\nThere was no significant consistent trend in overall bird numbers over the years. The regression of the density over time shows only a slight increase (b = 1.2, r = 0.15, n.s.). However, this does not exclude dramatic short-term density fluctuations. The most remarkable one is the reduction in bird numbers around the second decade of the 37-year period, as demonstrated by the moving density means of the available 28 successive 10-year periods ( Figure 10 ).\nThese mean values show a low for the period 1975-1984, being significantly lower than the maximum densities that occurred during the beginning and the end of the investigated period (t-test, p < 0.001 for both comparisons). The continuous decline begins with the fourth 10-year period (1966) (1967) (1968) (1969) (1970) (1971) (1972) (1973) (1974) (1975) and is followed by a nearly continuous increase that peaks during the third last period (1987) (1988) (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) .\nThe influence of environmental temperature on the total community Wiens (1989b) investigated the specific problems arising when analysing the response of bird populations to changing environmental factors. One of them is the occurrence of time lags in the response that makes it more difficult to distinguish possible relations between different parameters, especially in short-term investigations. We were able to test relationships between bird numbers and temperature, including time lags. The relation between the longterm trends of the bird density and temperature as demonstrated by their moving mean values was also investigated. The environmental temperature may affect the bird density in various ways. At least three causal relationships are conceivable. (1) Spells of high temperature during the spring migration period, May and early June, apart from reducing the snow-covered area, are known to stimulate a prolongation of the migration routes with more birds arriving, especially in the actual northern border-line habitats. (2) The weather in June, including the temperature, may affect the breeding productivity in various ways, possibly influencing the bird numbers over the next few seasons. (3) The weather conditions in July are of importance for the final growth and maturation of the fledglings. Moreover, weather may affect the progress of the post-breeding recovery of the adult birds, with consequences for the prospects of surviving and returning to breed again next year. Therefore, the relationships between bird densities and mean temperature of each of three months have been investigated. The calendar periods of May, June, and July have been chosen as roughly 1963 1967 1971 1975 1979 1983 1987 1991 1995 1999 Derived density (DD) representing the migration/arrival, breeding, and post-breeding periods, respectively.\nIn Table 5 , the mean temperature for the whole 37-year period is presented for each of the three months, which differ significantly (t-tests, p < 0.001). The difference between the coldest and warmest years amounts to about seven (May), six (June), and five (July) degrees. The temperature ranges of the adjacent months are only moderately overlapping (Table 5 ). The monthly temperature means of May and June and of June and July are not significantly correlated (r = 0.00 and 0.31, n.s., respectively). The monthly means did not change significantly over the 37 year study period (May: r = -0.19, June: r = -0.15, July: r = 0.25, all n.s.), i.e. there was no trend towards a warmer climate.\nThe inter-seasonal relationship between the temperature and bird density was investigated by calculating correlation coefficients (Table 6 ). There was no general relation between the temperature means of the three months and the bird density of the same season. The indicated negative correlation between the May temperature and bird density will be discussed later.\nThe correlations between the May temperature and the bird densities of the ensuing two seasons were insignificant. The June temperatures showed positive r-values when related to the bird density of the following two seasons, but there was a significant correlation only for the second one (Table 6) . A reasonable interpretation may be that more offspring are raised in a warmer June and that most of the surviving young birds do not establish permanent territories and breed until two years later. As pointed out above, only territorial birds are included in the density reference used to derive the density indices. Many passerines of the actual species reach sexual maturity towards the end of their first year, although generally a varying fraction of these one-year old birds do not breed until a year later (see Glutz von Blotzheim & Bauer (1985 ). The frequency of postponed breeding may show regional differences. It is possibly more common in the harsh environments in the far north as established for F. hypoleuca in the Table 6 . The correlation between the bird density of year x and the mean temperature of year x, year x-1 and year x-2 for the months of May, June and July, and also between the density of year x with the combined temperatures of June year x-2 and July x-1. The correlations have been calculated for different durations, counted from the start of the 37-year period. r = coefficient of correlation, p = probability level, designated as n. (Nyholm 1986 ) and L. svecica in northernmost Finland (J\u00e4rvinen & Pieti\u00e4inen 1983) .\nOur results indicate that this may also be true for other passerine species in the region. The bird density was generally correlated with the July temperature with a delay of one year, with no demonstrable effect after two years (Table 6 ). High July temperatures may imply an improved nutritional situation for the fledglings and the adult birds. The young of many passerines are fed by their parents for twice as long outside the nest as in it (Martin 1987 with references). It follows that feeding may continue into July for many passerines in our study area, e.g. in F. montifringilla (Lindstr\u00f6m et al. MS) . Moreover, the yearlings as well as the adult birds will be better prepared to endure the strains of the migration and wintering periods, which means that more birds will survive and return the following year. A fraction of the returning one-year old birds may refrain from breeding, the two-year old and older birds probably account for the main bulk of the correlation between the community density and the July temperature of the previous season.\nAs a consequence of the interpretations above, we would expect the combination of the mean temperatures of June the first year and July the second year to show a closer correlation to the bird density of the third year than the temperatures of the individual months. This was confirmed by the test presented in Table 6 . The correlation was significant for all investigated period lengths. This combination of the mean temperatures of the two months will be referred to below as the combined June and July temperatures.\nThe residual density variation not explained by the combined June and July temperatures was calculated and correlated with the May temperatures. The correlation coefficients were all negative and of higher numerical values than those for May in Table  6 . That of the whole 37-year period was statistically significant (r = -0.37, n = 35, p < 0.05). This relation can be explained by the fact that the whole study area is located on south-facing mountain slopes, thus well exposed to and warmed by solar radiation, which is important, especially in springtime. Our study area therefore loses its snow cover earlier than the surrounding areas that are located in less exposed positions or at higher levels. In cold springs, the arriving birds may find only limited parts of the area sufficiently snow-free to occupy. This most likely means a certain concentration of established territories in the study area.\nThe long-term bird density trend, as demonstrated by the moving means of the 10-year periods, was compared with the corresponding moving means of the June and July temperatures ( Figure 10 ). Three things are immediately apparent.\n(1) The main course of the June temperature curve strongly resembles that of the bird density during the first 17 of the 28 periods (r = 0.81, n = 17, p < 0.001). This indicates that factors related to the environmental June temperature have caused the marked bird density dip around 1980.\n(2) The two curves tended to diverge from the 18 th 10-year period and onwards, resulting in a negative correlation (r = -0.68, n = 11, p < 0.02). This is in accordance with the information given in Table  6 , where the r-values of the correlation between the mean monthly temperatures and the bird densities declined when the last period of the 37 years was included in the test. Obviously, factors other than those positively correlated with the environmental temperature could maintain or raise the bird numbers, even when the temperature trend decreases significantly.\n(3) The July temperature was negatively correlated with the density trend of the bird community (r = -0.43, n = 28, p < 0.05). The explanation could be the fact that practically all fledglings are produced in June. Therefore, a warmer July in the same season cannot do more than augment the quality and the survival rate of the fledglings already produced. This means that the correlation runs the risk of becoming negative when the reproductive rate during cold June months decreases, all the more as the moving temperature trends of June and July tend to be negatively correlated.\nNo significant relation could be established between the long-term trend of the temperature in May and the density of the bird community, with the exception of the first ten periods. The latter show a negative correlation (r = -0.70, p < 0.05).\nIn summary, temperature-related environmental factors seem to affect the fluctuations of the total bird community among the breeding seasons. An increased bird density in the study area follows a chillier May, presumably due to a delayed thaw that forces the arriving birds to gather in the limited snow-free areas. The monthly temperature means of June and July are positively correlated to the bird densities with a time lag of two and one year, respectively. The mean temperature in June, when most fledglings are produced, seems to be the most important one. There are periods when factors other than the positively temperature-related ones may decide the direction of the population development. Golovatin (2002) found that the density of passerine birds were positively correlated to the spring and summer temperature of the preceding breeding season in a 9.3 km 2 study area in the lower Ob region of Russia. The 11-year investigation was carried out in a subarctic habitat comprising moss bogs and \"afforested moss bogs\". He assumed that the correlation was mainly due to increased survival rate of the fledged young in warmer seasons, i.e. a similar effect to that following the increased July temperature in our study. Golovatin also found that the spring temperature did not significantly influence the bird density the same year but instead affected the distribution of birds within larger areas, which is similar to our interpretation of the effect of the May temperature variation.\nThere are some studies at the species level demonstrating how a temperature-related change in the reproductive rate is followed by a density alteration in the ensuing season, as in F. hypoleuca (Virolainen 1984) . J\u00e4rvinen (1989) showed that the betweenyear variability in temperature is greater in northern than in southern Finland and that the within-season predictability is far higher in the north. This should select for adjusting the breeding performance to the environmental conditions (contrary to the situation in the south). In fact, in his 22-year study A. J\u00e4rvinen found significant positive correlation between the temperature in the latter half of June and the female weight, egg volume, hatching and nesting success in the subalpine birch zone at Kilpisj\u00e4rvi (65\u00b0 N). The investigated species was F. hypoleuca but the results are probably valid for the small passerine species in general (J\u00e4rvinen & V\u00e4is\u00e4nen 1984) . It can therefore be expected that the breeding outcome will correlate with the environmental temperature in June, even to the extent that it is reflected in the density dynamics of the bird community. This assumption is strongly supported by the bird density fluctuations related to the June temperature in our study area."}, {"section_title": "Fluctuations in the species populations", "text": "Twenty of the most common species are presented in Table 7 along with selected statistical population parameters. These species make up 98.4% of the average density of the total passerine community. The fluctuations between years are often considerable ( Figure 5 ).\nAccording to the heterogeneity tests no less than 15 species vary significantly between seasons. Those species that remain constant are all represented by low-density figures. Nine species show significant trends in their population development, five of them increasing and four declining. These species all belong to the less abundant ones.\nIt is evident that a comprehensive comparison with the fluctuation patterns of the Swedish bird populations is futile at present. A nation-wide birdmonitoring programme was started in Sweden in 1975 and a summary of the results has recently been published (Svensson & Lindstr\u00f6m 2002) . The fluctuations in the species populations have been followed with the aid of point counts. So far, only a minor part of the fieldwork has been carried out in northern Sweden and some northern species are therefore not recorded in large enough numbers, such as F. montifringilla and L. svecica. Consequently, comparisons cannot answer the question as to whether the population changes in the study area reflect more wide-ranging fluctuations. However, there are a few short-term concordant changes, such as the approximately 50% reduction of A. trivialis in Sweden between 1987 and 1993 and the 80% drop in our study area between 1988 and 1993. The abundant Ph. trochilus shows no long-term trend whereas this species has increased significantly in our study area between 1975 and 1999 (linear regression upon time, r = 0.45, n =25, p < 0.001). This may partly reflect the fact that the two compared populations belong to different subspecies, Ph. t. acredula in the north and mainly Ph. t. trochilus in the south, probably with different migration strategies. The rising numbers at Ammarn\u00e4s could partly have been a consequence of the significant population reduction that occurred there in the late 1970s. This population decline may not have involved the southern parts of the country.\nThe moving 10-year means of the majority of the species show a similar density trend to that of the total community, i.e. a steady decline over many years preceding the minimum value of the 1975-1984 period, followed by an increase during a varying number of years. Ph. trochilus, F. montifringilla and T. iliacus, which make up 65% of the total assembly, follow the curve of the total assembly very closely. "}, {"section_title": "Environmental temperature and species density fluctuations", "text": "Even if the environmental temperature shows interesting and partly clarifying relations to the density fluctuations in the total bird assembly, it does not follow that this applies to all of the species. A drawback is, however, that many species are too scarce to provide reliable information. The following calculations were therefore restricted to the 14 species with a mean density index of three or more per km 2 (Table 8) . There are few statistically significant correlations between the densities of these species and the combined temperatures of June and July (Table 8 ). However, the positive correlation coefficients are dominant (47 out of the 56 r-values), which was to be expected, since the correlations for the total community are significant throughout ( Table  7) . The main observations are given under the following six points.\n1. It is surprising that the most abundant of all species, Ph. trochilus, totally lacks significant correlations with the environmental temperature. The reason could be that the derived density indices deviate greatly from the territorial densities as established in the study plots. However, correlation tests using the study plot densities generally provide results that do not differ significantly from those shown in Table 8 . This indicates that the species is relatively insensitive to temperature fluctuations. Other regulating factors not related to the temperature may be dominant. However, there was a positive correlation between the moving means of the population density and the June temperature (the temperature curve, see Figure 10 ). The correlation was significant during the first 20 of the 28 periods (r = 0.84, p<0.001). Obviously Ph. trochilus shares a \"long-term\" dependence on certain temperatureassociated factors with the majority of the passerine species in the investigated area.The moving 10-year means of the July temperature was negatively and significantly correlated with the population density trend (r = -0.51, n = 28, p < 0.01), a similar though more pronounced relation than that of the total bird Table 7 . Mean derived densities (DD, number of territories/km 2 ) and standard deviations (SD) of the 20 commonest smaller passerines (species observed in the study area in at least 32 seasons). CV = coefficient of variation as a percentage of the mean, \u03c7 2 = heterogeneity value, b = slope of the linear regression of the DD upon time (cf. (Table 8 ). This was hardly expected, due to the fact that this species, as documented below, is significantly affected by the Epirrita cycles, which could at least partly obscure the response to the temperature fluctuations. When each of the two months were investigated separately with the same time lags taken into account, it is clear that the July temperature was the most important with highly significant r-values throughout the 37-year period (p<0.01 to <0.001), whereas the r-values of the June temperature were far from being statistically significant. This indicates that bad environmental conditions in July can severely reduce the increased reproductive output resulting from the rich supply of Epirrita larvae in June (but see Lindstr\u00f6m et al. MS) .\n3. The density of C. flammea shows the second strongest correlation with the temperature fluctuations (Table 8 ). In contrast to F. montifringilla, the June temperature of two years previously is most important, manifested by significant correlations for the three longest year periods (p < 0.05 to p < 0.01), whereas the bird density correlates insignificantly with the July temperature.\n4. The density fluctuations of the thrushes T. iliacus and T. pilaris show a rather weak correlation with the combined June and July temperatures (Table  8) . However, they resemble C. flammea in that the temperature in June is apparently of the utmost importance for their reproductive output, which is indicated by the fact that it correlates positively and significantly with the bird density figures two years later (p < 0.01 for three of the four tested period lengths, both species).\n5. As described above, the 10-year moving density means of 11species closely followed that of the total community and they were significantly correlated at varying probability levels with the 10-year moving means of the June temperature during the first three quarters of the 37-year period.\n6. The May mean temperatures generally showed an insignificant negative correlation to the density of the total bird community in that season (Table 6) . No less than ten of the 14 species in Table 8 show   Table 8 . The correlation between the density of 14 species populations of year x and the the mean of the sum of the June temperature of year (x-2) and the July temperature of year (x-1). The correlation coefficients have been calculated for different durations, counted from the start of the 37-year project. The species are listed after their mean population density (cf. Figure 7) . Species with a mean derived density of less than three territories per km 2 have been excluded. r = coefficient of correlation, p = probability level, designated as n. In summary, the density fluctuations of most species tend to be positively correlated with the combined June and July temperatures. However, only few correlations are statistically significant. Each of the separate months is responsible for a significant correlation with a time lag of one (July) or two (June) years for a few species. The moving 10-year means of most species populations correlate positively and significantly with the moving means of the June temperatures during a greater part of the 37-year period."}, {"section_title": "The influence of the Epirrita autumnata outbreaks", "text": "The green Epirrita caterpillars unquestionably constitute part of the food with which the parent birds feed their young as demonstrated for T. iliacus (Arheimer 1978) , C. flammea (Enemar & Nystr\u00f6m 1981) and F. montifringilla (Hogstad 1988) . Moreover, birds of various species have been observed carrying green-coloured food portions to their nests during the outbreak seasons. The marked appearance and disappearance of such a superabundant food source may affect the bird density fluctuations. The following two points should be borne in mind when interpreting the relations between the Epirrita cycles and the bird numbers.\n1) The nutritional quality of the caterpillars as food for the birds may decline during the last outbreak years, for example as a side effect of the birches\u0107 hemical defence against the larval attacks. The interaction between the Epirrita caterpillars and the birches has been investigated (e.g. Haukioja 1980 , Haukioja & Hanhim\u00e4ki 1985 , Hanhim\u00e4ki & Senn 1992 ) and a number of significant chemical substances produced by the birches and their likely relation to the caterpillar growth are known (Suomela et al. 1995 , Ossipov et al. 2001 ). The question is whether any of these substances affect the palatability of the grazing caterpillars from the birds\u00b4 point of view. Anyhow, the size or mass of the caterpillars and pupae seems to decline during the final years of an outbreak (Hogstad 1996 , Kaitaniemi et al. 1999 .\n2) The vegetation is affected by the grazing larvae to varying degrees, in the form of defoliation, reduced flowering and seed production of birches and various herbs, perhaps also in an impoverished insect fauna (cf. e.g. Sel\u00e5s et al. 2001 ). This might be a disadvantage for some bird species.\nIt is reasonable to assume that the superabundance of caterpillars during the Epirrita outbreaks would entice more bird species than usual to settle and breed in the study area. A moderate response is indicated by the curve showing the yearly number of species over the 37 seasons (Figure 8) . The three peaks with 31, 33, and 34 species occur during the first, second and third Epirrita period, respectively. The species numbers are positively correlated with the caterpillar abundance over the first ten (r = 0.82, p < 0.01) and twenty years (r = 0.53, p < 0.02). The significant correlation disappears after 1984.\nThe possible relation between the outbreaks of the moth caterpillars and bird densities has been investigated by calculating the correlation coefficients, thereby considering possible time lags and even anticipatory reactions. Three periods were investigated, starting at the beginning of the insect census work and extending over 10, 20 and 33 seasons. They include one, two, and three complete Epirrita outbreaks, respectively. The results of the calculations of the total passerine community (excl. Corvidae) and the 14 most abundant species have been studied. The results of the calculations regarding the community and five selected species can be found in Table 9 . There are relatively few significant r-values, and the insignificant positive and negative coefficients are of about the same frequency. This is also true for the remaining nine species not included in the table.\nThe only species that shows a highly significant relation to the Epirrita cycles is F. montifringilla (Table 9 ), a fact that has been repeatedly established (Silvola 1967 , Hogstad 1969 , 2000 , Ytreberg 1972 , Enemar et al. 1984 , Lindstr\u00f6m 1987 . Its density is high in years with a mass occurrence of caterpillars. The density also increases significantly one year earlier, leading to somewhat higher correlation coefficients. However, there is no significant correlation with two years earlier, which means that the species responds very quickly and strongly in seasons marking the start of a new mass outbreak, probably with less than ten larvae per 1000 short shoots. The habitat may be \"saturated\" with caterpillars from the bird\u00b4s point of view very early in the cycle, i.e. years before the peaks of mass occurrence. Furthermore, the bird density tends to decline when the caterpillars are still abundant ( Figure  6 ). This could be a reaction to a change in caterpillar quality brought about by the anti-predator reactions of the birches. Anyhow, the impression is that the increase and decrease of F. montifringilla precede that of the Epirrita caterepillars by about one season. The early density increase of finches is also indicated by the corresponding curves obtained in a Norwegian subalpine birch forest (Hogstad 2000) .\nThe increased reproductive output during the outbreak years (Lindstr\u00f6m 1987 , Hogstad 2000 is not followed by a population increase in the subsequent two seasons. The birds apparently disappear, which is in accordance with the nomadic behaviour of the species (Mikkonen 1983 , Hogstad 1985 , which has little or no site tenacity (Lindstr\u00f6m 1987 ). As demonstrated above, Table 9 . The correlation between the bird density (total passerine community, selected species) of year x and the abundance of Epirrita larvae the same year (x), the following year (x+1), and the two preceding years (x-1) and (x-2). The correlations have been calculated for different durations counted from the start of the Epirrita investigations (1967). r = coefficient of correlation, p = probability level, designated as n.s. when p > 0.05. (r-v\u00e4rden, n.s., 0.05, osv.) Table 9 (r = 0.64, 0.62 and 0.51 for Epirrita year x, and 0.84, 0.82 and 0.63 for year (x+1), all with p-values of 0.01 or 0.001, whereas the r-values of the years (x-1) and (x-2) remained far from significant). The densities of F. montifringilla can also rise to high or moderate peaks between the Epirrita outbreaks as was the case in 1968 ). This indicates that F. montifringilla is not entirely dependent on the Epirrita caterpillars for its accumulation and breeding start. An unknown food source may be of importance, perhaps favoured by a habitat not heavily grazed by caterpillars. The significance of the breeding during these seasons cannot be evaluated at present. The birds sometimes abandon their nests during or after laying and move elsewhere (Hogstad 1982) ."}, {"section_title": "Sambandet mellan t\u00e4theterna \u00e5r x f\u00f6r dels hela f\u00e5gelsamh\u00e4llet, dels valda arter, och f\u00f6rekomsten av fj\u00e4llbj\u00f6rkm\u00e4-tarlarver (Epirrita) samma \u00e5r (x), efterf\u00f6ljande \u00e5r (x+1) och de f\u00f6reg\u00e5ende b\u00e5da \u00e5ren (x-1) och (x-2).

This indicates that the rich supply of larvae increases the reproductive rate, which is followed by a bird density increase two years later when the surviving young birds may return and breed. A.trivialis shows the strongest reaction and also correlates significantly with the caterpillar abundance of the previous season (a time lag of only one year).\nC. flammea is included in Table 9 because it is the only species showing an exclusively negative, albeit insignificant, relation to the appearance of the caterpillars, a fact that also holds true after allowance was made for the effect of the mean June and July temperatures. This general tendency may be a consequence of the possible outbreak-induced deterioration of the seed-producing vegetation. C. flammea is a granivorous bird that feeds its young with various seeds to a great extent (Enemar & Nystr\u00f6m 1981) .\nIn summary, the bird community density generally shows only a weak reaction to the Epirrita outbreaks. The prime responder is F. montifringilla, which shows increased density not only during the years of mass occurrence, but also one season in advance. The fact that most species seem to be unaffected suggests that possible negative consequences of the grazing larvae should be considered when evaluating the effect of the additional food supply that is represented by the caterpillars themselves.\nPositive correlations between the abundance of lepidopteran caterpillars and the density and reproductive rate of passerine species have been established elsewhere in forests other than the subalpine variety (e.g. Morris et al. 1958 , Zach & Falls 1975 , Holmes et al. 1986 , Crawford & Jennings 1989 , Tomialojc & Wesolowski 1990 ). Moreover, certain species are reported to appear in the study plots only during the outbreak years (Holmes & Sherry 2001) . As expected, experiences differ as to the extent and duration of the response in the investigated communities. In general, the community density does not significantly correlate with the appearance of the caterpillars. As a rule, a more or less clear response is restricted to only a few species populations. However, Wesolowski & Tomialojc (1997) conclude that most insectivorous species in BNP do not vary in line with the fluctuations in caterpillar occurrence and suggest that other factors have a more important influence on the bird numbers. Moreover, the seasons with low caterpillar density do not necessarily mean a shortage of food for the breeding birds. This is similar to the situation in the subalpine birch forests. On the other hand, low larval occurrence can be indicative of a shortage of food in the Hubbard Brook study plots (Holmes 1988 , Holmes et al. 1991 , Holmes & Sherry 2001 . Bird fluctuations coincided with the actual caterpillar density or were significantly correlated with that of the previous season, even at low (normal or so-called endemic) larval abundance."}, {"section_title": "The relations between the density fluctuations of the species", "text": "A general view of the correspondence between the species fluctuations has been obtained by calculating the correlation coefficients for all combinations of species pairs. The 20 passerines that have been present in the study area for 32 seasons or more give rise to 190 coefficients, of which 151 are positive and only 39 negative, thus indicating an overwhelming tendency towards co-variation between the fluctuation patterns of these species. However, only 50 coefficients are significant at the 5% level, 46 of which are positive. In the case that all species populations fluctuate independently of each other, 10 coefficients at the 5% level of significance, could nonetheless be expected to appear, five of them positive. As there are in fact significantly more positive than negative correlations in the study area (\u03c7 2 = 12.8, p < 0.001) it appears justified to conclude that the fluctuation patterns of many species have a tendency to co-vary. In fact, all 20 species co-varied significantly with at least one community member. In contrast, there are only four significant negative correlations, which means that species pairs with reversed fluctuation patterns are not statistically established as a normal occurrence in the studied community.\nIn this regard, the bird community of a primeval deciduous forest (BNP) in Poland resembles our community to a surprisingly large extent (Wesolowski & Tomialojc 1997) . Pair-wise comparisons of 26 species of which all but three were passerines resulted in 27.4% significant positive correlation coefficients, which is very close to our figure (24.2%). Significant negative correlations were extremely rare in both investigations, amounting to between 2% and 4%.\nThe variance ratio V (J\u00e4rvinen 1979) was calculated and applied in the analysis of the fluctuation patterns of the first 20 seasons (1963) (1964) (1965) (1966) (1967) (1968) (1969) (1970) (1971) (1972) (1973) (1974) (1975) (1976) (1977) (1978) (1979) (1980) (1981) (1982) (Enemar et al. 1984) . Although the V-test has been questioned by James & Boecklen (1984) , it is used here for comparison only and \"as a descriptor of species patterns \" (Schluter 1984 ). The first 20 seasons gave rise to a V-value of 0.44, i.e. well below unity, which indicates that the fluctuation patterns of the species populations tend to co-vary rather than the opposite. The succeeding 17 seasons accentuated this tendency by reducing the ratio to 0.30 for that period, resulting in a V-value of 0.40 for the entire 37-year period. Obviously many species pairs or groups in the community share common features in their fluctuation patterns.\nThe degree of covariation between the fluctuation patterns of the species populations and groups can be investigated by carrying out a cluster analysis resulting in a so-called dendrogram (Cody 1974) . This was done for the 18 (1965-1982) of the 20 years of our project (Enemar et al. 1984) . The dendrogram displayed three distinct clusters of species. The species were mainly assorted in the clusters according to their different migration strategies, one group (A) was made up of tropical migrants (T-species), while two groups comprised short-distant migrants (Sspecies), of which one contained those species with irruptive migratory behaviour (B) and the other the remaining two short-distance and one long-distance migrant, all \"ground-dwellers\" in the breeding area (C). The interpretation of the dendrogram was that the annual density values in the breeding area are Figure 11 . Proximity matrices showing the correlation between pairs of the thirteen most abundant species as regards density fluctuations in the study area. Squares with significant correlation coefficients (p < 0.05) are shaded. The species are included in the matrices in the same order as in the dendrogram published by Enemar et al. (1984) , which was based on 18 of the first 20 seasons in the study area. The top matrix corresponds to the dendrogram (1965) (1966) (1967) (1968) (1969) (1970) (1971) (1972) (1973) (1974) (1975) (1976) (1977) (1978) (1979) (1980) (1981) (1982) , while the bottom matrix shows the correlation coefficients of the total project period . The upper matrix displays three aggregations of significant coefficients; a large one in the upper section corresponding to cluster A in the dendrogram (longdistance migrants, with the short-distance migrantnT. philomelos as the exception), and two smaller ones, corresponding to the cluster B and cluster C of the dendrogram, the latter in the bottom right-hand section. Clusters B and C represent short-distance migrants with the long-distance migrantnL. svecica as the only exception. The bottom matrix shows that clusters A and C persist even with the addition of the first two and the last 17 years, whereas the presence of cluster B has declined markedly. southern Sweden showed a distinct division into two \"fluctuation groups\", mainly consisting of tropical and short-distance migrants, respectively (Enemar et. al. 1994 ). However, other investigations have revealed little or no synchronic fluctuations related to common wintering areas. This may be at least partly due to the fact that the time-scale of the investigations has not been long enough to compensate for various background disturbances (for references, see Enemar et al. 1994) . It is interesting to note that, based on their 20-year census work in BNP, Wesolowski & Tomialojc (1997) did not find a corresponding grouping of population fluctuations."}, {"section_title": "Rutdiagram som visar styrkan i samvariationen mellan de 13 vanligaste arternas t\u00e4theter i fj\u00e4llbj\u00f6rkskogen.

Herrera, with reference to Moreau (1952) , includes all species that are resident or that winter within the Western Palaearctic in one and the same category, that of resident species, despite the fact that many of them are short-distance migrants (S-species). True passerine residents wintering in the birch forests of our study area are few and occur irregularly. Flocks of C. flammea forage there in winters following summers with rich birch mast seeding and scattered pairs of'Parus montanus have been observed. The Sspecies are the first to arrive and settle in the springtime and, according to Herrera (1978) , the later arriving T-species then repopulate the area in numbers that are determined by the amount of space and resources not exploited by birds already present. Therefore, the number of settling T-species depends on, among other things, the winter survival of the Sspecies. The proportion between the densities of the two species groups may of course vary between seasons, perhaps partly in an opposing manner. Herrera\u00b4s model has been studied and verified by O\u00b4Connor (1981) , Berthold (1990) , Morozov (1993) , and Enemar et al. (1994) . M\u00f6nkk\u00f6nen et al. (1990) and Timonen et al. (1994) have questioned it, as did Wesolowski & Tomialojc (1997) who found that its validity could change from one decade to another. The proportion of T-species has remained close to 40 percent of the total community at Ammarn\u00e4s over the 37 years, and their total density has been about half that of the community. The seasonal densities of the two species groups are positively and significantly correlated in our study area (Figure 12 ). The test strongly affected by the survival rate in the wintering area and during migration. Therefore, the breeding densities of species with common migration and wintering behaviour should show similar fluctuation patterns.\nThe result of a different co-variation analysis based on the 37-year data sample is presented in the \"proximity matrix\" of Figure 11 . A cluster analysis was abandoned due to its tendency to exaggerate minor differences in the correlation coefficients when \"clustering\" pairs of species or species groups. The \"proximity matrix\" illustrates the complexity of the calculated relations between the fluctuation patterns of the species in a more realistic way. For comparative purposes, the matrix was based on the proportional density values of the same species as in the 18-year dendrogram, and these are listed in that same order. In the matrix, the squares with significant correlation coeff icients show a grouping approximately corresponding to the A, B, and C migration clusters of the dendrogram. The latter has been \"translated\" into a corresponding proximity matrix to facilitate comparison (Figure 11 ). The general pattern of clusters persists even after the addition of the post-1982 period. The group C species are exactly the same, whereas the similarity between the tropical group A of the 18 and 37-year periods, although obvious, is less definite. Group B is less interesting in both analyses because it consists of rather loosely related species with the exception of the two thrush species T. iliacus and T. pilaris, which showed the strongest co-variation of all species pairs in both analyses. The two \"rebellious\" species are the S-species T. philomelos and the T-species Ph. trochilus. T. philomelos is still closely linked to group A, i.e. it remains a tropical migrant in respect of its fluctuation pattern. Ph. trochilus has come closer to group B over the last 17 years, resulting in its highest correlation coefficients with the thrush species (Figure 11) . Nevertheless, the information contained in the Figure 11matrix does not seem to provide sufficient grounds for entirely abandoning the hypothesis that the migration strategy is a significant factor influencing the pattern of the bird density variation in our study area.\nMany studies have documented the fact that changes in winter survival rates are followed by changes in the breeding density (e.g. Fretwell 1972 , Newton 1998 . It is therefore not surprising that the fluctuation patterns of the species in a study area tend to be grouped together according to their wintering and migratory habits. Over a 40-year period, the bird community of a small study plot in to create the competitive situation on which Herrera\u00b4s interpretations are based. B\u00f6hning-Gaese et al. (1994) investigated the relation between the short-term fluctuations and the longterm trends of pairs of bird species populations using the data collected by the North American Breeding Bird Survey. They derived two dissimilarity indices of each species pair, one based on the difference between the regression coefficients of the long-term population trends, and one for the annual fluctuations calculated for each species pair based on the correlation coefficient of the residuals from the long-term trends. The indices vary from 0 (totally similar regressions) to 2 (totally dissimilar fluctuations). By comparing the two indices B\u00f6hning-Gaese et al. (1994) found, among other things, that two co-existing species exhibiting similar shortterm fluctuation patterns could nevertheless have opposing long-term population trends, and vice versa. They concluded that investigations over restricted time-scales should not be used to predict the longterm trends, a well-founded warning, as the vast majority of bird census investigations have been carried out on small temporal scales. Wesolowski & Tomialojc (1997) found that the dissimilarity indices of the long-term trends and short-term fluctuations of their species pairs were not at all correlated (r = 0.004, n = 325), thus supporting the results of B\u00f6hning-Gaese et al. (1994) . When applied to the 20 passerines in our study area the test resulted in the same information (r = 0.001, n = 190). The matrices show that most values of both dissimilarity indices are less than 1, the mean index of the long-term trends being 0.2 \u00b10.18, and that of the annual fluctuations 0.8 \u00b10.20. Thus both indices give the impression of a bird community with a remarkable concordance in the dynamics of the different species populations. As shown above, this does not mean that the two indices are correlated. Two species may have quite different long-term trends despite exhibiting similar fluctuation patterns."}, {"section_title": "Long-term trends versus short-term fluctuations", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Examples of strengths and weaknesses of long-term bird census work", "text": "One may well ask whether the annual census work in the subalpine birch forest has provided any new and reliable information on important aspects on its bird community exclusively due to its time span of nearly four decades. If we had not believed in the promising included all species with a mean density index of three or more, making up 95.3% of the total community.\nThis relation between the T-and S-species is quite contrary to that found in the bird community of Birdsong Valley in southernmost Sweden where the species groups showed a significant negative correlation over 40 years (Enemar et al. 1994) . However, the comparison may be inaccurate because the investigation was confined to a small and isolated study plot with, on average, 124 territories, and, moreover, the density figures only represented mapped territories. The latter may better reflect competitive effects than is the case with the density indices of this study, which also includes nonterritorial birds from the line transects. Therefore, the number of mapped territories in our study plots has been subjected to the same correlation analysis. The result does not differ greatly from that based on the derived densities. The proportion of the T-species density (31%) and the regression coefficient (b = 0.44, r = 0.45, p < 0.05) are somewhat lower, although both reductions are far from being statistically significant. Herrera\u00b4s hypothesis is obviously not valid in all respects in our subalpine birch forest. The concordant fluctuation trends of the T-and S-species are indicative of the unsaturated state of the habitat as suggested by Enemar et al. (1984) . In other words, the habitat is probably not populated densely enough potential of our fieldwork, all project members would no doubt have opted to become monks or molecular biologists instead, to quote Wiens (1981) . However, we were confident that a long-term series of census work of consistent quality would help to avoid wrong conclusions due to census periods of insufficient duration and to identify qualities and correlations that are otherwise difficult to recognise due to the unavoidable \"background noise\" caused by e.g. random events, unusual occurrences and census errors. Our expectations have been reasonably fulfilled as indicated by the following three selected examples. A fourth example is added illustrating that even a long-term series can provide totally exceptional information.\n1) The passerine bird community is at equilibrium in the sense that its bird density trend has not changed over the 37-year period. This does not exclude considerable fluctuations between seasons, including also fairly long-term trends within the period, such as the continuous community density decline from about 1970 to 1980, as illustrated by the moving 10-year density means (Figure 10 ). Had the project terminated in 1984 as a 22-year project, even then deemed a long-term one, the most obvious suggestion would have been that long-term environmental deterioration was in progress with negative consequences for the birds. However, the continuation of the census programme showed that the community recovered and once again attained \"original\" density levels.\n2) The fluctuations of the total community are signif icantly correlated with those of the environmental June and July temperature means, when certain time lags are considered (Table 6 ). This relation is also clearly demonstrated by the moving 10-year means of the June temperature during the first two thirds of the project period (Figure 10 ). Thanks to the prolongation of the fieldwork, one is saved from believing that the correlation is axiomatic. The last third of the period shows that other longterm factors might overshadow the effect of those correlated to the long-term temperature fluctuations in June.\n3) One of the most exciting prospects of the longterm project was to collect sufficient data to permit successful analyses of the bird community reactions to the cyclic outbreaks of the autumnal moth Epirrita autumnata. To our surprise, the dynamics of the community is only weakly affected, and the reaction is mainly due to the abundant F. montifringilla, the prime responder to the mass caterpillar occurrences. The outbreaks probably increased the reproductive rate of only three ground-nesting species as indicated by a population increase two years later. Thanks to the consistency of the long-term results in these matters, one dares to suggest that the nutritional capacity of the habitat is so good that the mass appearance of the caterpillars does not have much impact on the majority of the species. 4) How long, then, is a long-term census? Several authors (e.g. Wiens 1984 , Calder III 1984 , Tomialojc & Wesolowski 1994 ) have commented on this (1965-1974) fram till 35 \u00e5r (1965-1999) . Det undre diagrammet visar hur sambandet varierar f\u00f6r de 26 enskilda 10-\u00e5rsperioderna, fr\u00e5n den f\u00f6rsta 1965 -1974 till den sista 1990 . H\u00e4r \u00e4r variationen st\u00f6rre med en 10-\u00e5rsperiod (1975 , d\u00e5 inget som helst samband fanns mellan de b\u00e5da arternas s\u00e4tt att fluktuera.\nquestion. There is of course no definite answer. A 10-year period has often been considered sufficiently long-term. However, the following example illustrates how even a 10-year period can provide a totally exceptional result in relation to what should be considered as \"normal\".\nNeedless to say, long-term census work is required to identify co-varying species pairs, such as the T. pilaris and T. iliacus population densities. As shown in Figure 13 , the correlation coefficient is about 0.9 for the 10-year period 1965-1974, after which it remains high and fluctuates between 0.8 and 0.9 for each additional year up to the end of the 37-year period in 1999. However, the correlation coefficient for each separate 10-year period partly provides quite a different pattern (Figure 13) . The initially high coefficients show a decrease beginning with the period ending in 1980 and falling to an all time low four periods later. It returns to the higher level after another four periods. It is remarkable that the minimum coefficient is close to zero. This means that the two species fluctuate quite independently during the period [1975] [1976] [1977] [1978] [1979] [1980] [1981] [1982] [1983] [1984] . Had the census work been restricted to that specific ten-year period, the generally very strong relation between the two thrush species would have remained undetected, not even suspected. Enemar et al. (1984) suggested that the birch woods of our study area are unsaturated, i.e. there are on average fewer breeding birds than the habitat could support. A number of observations and results indicating this state were listed. The experiences of the continued investigations in the area have provided no reason to abandon the \"unsaturation hypothesis\". Instead, it has been strengthened by new information such as the concordant fluctuations of the tropical and the short-distant migrants and the density response to increased mean temperature in June, both indicating a rather \"competition-free\" state in the habitat. The question now is why the unsaturated state seems to be so consistently maintained, perhaps being one of the principal and distinctive characteristics of this northern bird community."}, {"section_title": "Concluding hypothesis: Why does the rich subalpine birch forest remain unsaturated?", "text": "A possible explanation could be that the northern habitat represents an area of bird community sink. This would mean that the bird numbers are largely maintained by an immigrant surplus from outside the subalpine zone but that this immigration is, on average, too limited to saturate the habitat. However, this view is contradicted by the fact that the community density shows no relation to the temperature of the current season.\nThe habitat may well be more productive and richer from the birds\u00b4 point of view than what the density figures suggest. This assumption is supported by the fact that most species densities seem to remain largely unaffected by the cyclic mass occurrences of the Epirrita caterpillars indicating that the habitat is richly and more or less permanently supplied with other food sources. The reproductive efficiency of the birds is probably considerable as indicated by the clutch sizes, which coincide with the well-known latitudinal trend (Lack 1968) , and by the egg sizes (nine passerine species investigated), which are equal to or larger than those in Central Europe (Enemar & Arheimer 1999 ). Thus there is no reason to suspect the presence of a failing reproductive capacity that could contribute to a state of bird community sink. Instead, the available information indicates that the community is self-supporting and is even able to respond with a density increase to high June temperatures (see above). Nonetheless, the unsaturated state of the community seems to prevail in the long run.\nAn explanation may be related to the sometimes pronounced instability characterizing the northern bird communities. It can be demonstrated by comparing the community fluctuations in our study area with that of rich deciduous woods in more southerly regions, such as in BNP in Poland (Wesolowski & Tomialojc 1997 , Wesolowski et al. 2002 . The span between the minimum and maximum densities is three times larger at Ammarn\u00e4s than in BNP and the maximum increase between two successive seasons is four times greater. It has been suggested that this difference is a consequence of the unpredictability of the weather in the north, where extremes are more disastrous for the breeding activities than in the south (J\u00e4rvinen 1979 ). Moreover, due to the short breeding season in the north there is less time available for laying replacement clutches, especially when the first breeding attempt has failed at a relatively advanced stage. Thus, the breeding acitivities in the northern bird community are probably so frequently disturbed by poor weather conditions with negative effects on the reproduction that the average bird density is prevented from approaching the carrying capacity of the habitat. We suggest, therefore, that the weather factor is important in maintaining the apparent unsaturated state of the bird community in our study area. One can speculate on whether the global warming will induce smoother fluctuation patterns and increasing bird densities there in the long run."}, {"section_title": "Sammanfattning", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Inledning", "text": "Ett omfattande inventeringsarbete i syfte att studera fr\u00e4mst sm\u00e5f\u00e5gelsamh\u00e4llets sammans\u00e4ttning och fluktuationer i bl.a. fj\u00e4llbj\u00f6rkskog p\u00e5b\u00f6rjades 1963 i Ammarn\u00e4s-omr\u00e5det i s\u00f6dra Lappland.

Den varaktiga djupdykning, som f\u00e5gelt\u00e4theten uppvisar i diagrammet, m\u00e5ste ha orsakats av viktiga omgivningsfaktorer i h\u00e4ckningsmil-j\u00f6n, eftersom praktiskt taget alla arter deltog i nedg\u00e5ngen.

Eftersom inventeringarna i v\u00e5rt studieomr\u00e5de p\u00e5g\u00e5tt under s\u00e5 l\u00e5ng tid gjordes ett f\u00f6rs\u00f6k att unders\u00f6ka om n\u00e5got samband kunde p\u00e5visas mellan temperaturen och f\u00e5geltillg\u00e5ngen genomn\u00e5ren. Medeltemperaturerna f\u00f6r m\u00e5naderna maj, juni och juli behandlades var f\u00f6r sig av bl.a. f\u00f6ljande sk\u00e4l: 1. Varmluftinbrott i maj p\u00e5verkar sn\u00f6ns avsm\u00e4ltning samt kan stimulera vissa kontingenter v\u00e5rflyttande f\u00e5glar att f\u00f6rl\u00e4nga sin flyttning norrut, vilket skulle leda till h\u00f6gre t\u00e4theter varma v\u00e5rar. 2. Juni-temperaturen \u00e4r p\u00e5 flera s\u00e4tt av betydelse f\u00f6r h\u00e4ckningsfram-g\u00e5ngen. 3. Juli-temperaturen p\u00e5verkar de flygga ungarnas utveckling till sj\u00e4lvst\u00e4ndiga individer och de gamla f\u00e5glarnas m\u00f6jlighet till \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning efter h\u00e4ckningsanstr\u00e4ngningen.\nMedeltemperaturen f\u00f6r hela 37-\u00e5rsperioden presenteras f\u00f6r var och en av de tre m\u00e5naderna i Tabell 5. Som v\u00e4ntat skiljer sig m\u00e5nadstemperaturerna signifikant fr\u00e5n varandra. Skillnaden mellan h\u00f6gsta och l\u00e4gsta m\u00e5nadsmedelv\u00e4rde var sju grader f\u00f6r maj, sex f\u00f6r juni och fem f\u00f6r juli. M\u00e5nadernas medeltemperatur samvarierar icke, dvs en varm juni kan mycket v\u00e4l f\u00f6ljas av en kall juli.\nSambandet mellan medeltemperaturerna och f\u00e5-gelt\u00e4theten har unders\u00f6kts statistiskt med korrelationstest (Tabell 6). F\u00e5gelt\u00e4theten en viss s\u00e4song j\u00e4mf\u00f6rdes inte bara med m\u00e5nadernas medeltemperatur samma s\u00e4song utan \u00e4ven med temperaturerna ett och tv\u00e5 \u00e5r tidigare. F\u00f6r maj m\u00e5nad finns inget samband, vilket \u00e5r man \u00e4n v\u00e4ljer att j\u00e4mf\u00f6ra med. Junitemperaturen samvarierar med f\u00e5gelt\u00e4theten med tv\u00e5 \u00e5rs f\u00f6rdr\u00f6jning. Det betyder att ett gynnsamt varmt juniv\u00e4der \u00e5tf\u00f6ljs av h\u00f6jd f\u00e5gelt\u00e4thet n\u00e4stn\u00e4sta s\u00e4song. \u00c4ven juli-temperaturen samvarierar med f\u00e5gelt\u00e4theten och detta med ett \u00e5rs f\u00f6rdr\u00f6jning. Om man korrelerar f\u00e5gelt\u00e4theten f\u00f6r varje \u00e5r med den sammanslagna temperaturen f\u00f6r juni och juli tv\u00e5 resp. ett \u00e5r tidigare, blir samvariationen \u00e4n tydligare, vilket framg\u00e5r av sista raden i Tabell 6.\nVi tolkar resultaten som f\u00f6ljer. Det \u00e4r okontroversiellt att en h\u00f6gre medeltemperatur i juni fr\u00e4mjar en effektivare h\u00e4ckning (tidigare och st\u00f6rre \u00e4ggkullar, \u00f6kat antal flygga ungar per h\u00e4ckning, m.m.). Det knepiga \u00e4r att detta kan avl\u00e4sas i en h\u00f6jning av f\u00e5gelt\u00e4theten f\u00f6rst tv\u00e5 \u00e5r senare. En f\u00f6rklaring kan vara att de \u00e5terv\u00e4ndande ett-\u00e5riga ungf\u00e5glarna i stor utstr\u00e4ckning inte lyckas etablera varaktiga revir utan kommer till h\u00e4ckning f\u00f6rst som tv\u00e5-\u00e5ringar. Det har l\u00e4nge misst\u00e4nkts att bland t\u00e4ttingarna en varierande andel av de \u00f6verlevande ett-\u00e5riga hanarna, \u00e4ven om de \u00e5terkommer till h\u00e4ckningsomr\u00e5det, inte lyckas fullt ut med den komplicerade processen att etablera revir och attrahera en hona. Kunskapen om ett\u00e5ringarnas \u00f6den under h\u00e4ckningstiden \u00e4r emellertid \u00e4nnu fragmentarisk. Men v\u00e5ra resultat antyder att andelen icke h\u00e4ckande ett-\u00e5ringar \u00e4r relativt stor i de nordliga, klimatiskt k\u00e4rvare regionerna. Detta st\u00f6ds av erfarenheterna av de holkh\u00e4ckande svartvita flugsnapparna i Ammarn\u00e4s liksom av bl\u00e5hakebest\u00e5ndet i nordligaste Finland, d\u00e4r h\u00e4ckande ett-\u00e5riga hanar \u00e4r en s\u00e4llsynthet. Vad juli-temperaturen betr\u00e4ffar, \u00e4r det rimligt att t\u00e4nka sig, att den \u00e4r av betydelse f\u00f6r inte minst ett-\u00e5ringars och f\u00e4rdigh\u00e4ckade f\u00f6r\u00e4ldra-f\u00e5glars m\u00f6jlighet att i tid komma i god kondition inf\u00f6r den f\u00f6rest\u00e5ende flyttningen. Ett gynnsamt juliv\u00e4der en s\u00e4song skulle inneb\u00e4ra, att en st\u00f6rre andel \u00f6verlever till n\u00e4sta \u00e5r och d\u00e5 orsaka den konstaterade \u00f6kningen i f\u00e5gelt\u00e4theten.\nTemperaturens betydelse kan \u00e5sk\u00e5dligg\u00f6ras \u00e4ven p\u00e5 s\u00e4tt, som visas i Figur 10. Kurvorna d\u00e4r bygger p\u00e5 s.k. glidande medelv\u00e4rden f\u00f6r 10-\u00e5rs perioder, en metod som f\u00f6rklarades ovan. Med detta f\u00f6rfarande minskas effekten av s\u00e5dana tillf\u00e4lliga och dramatiska sv\u00e4ngningar, som endast \"r\u00f6r till bilden\". Diagrammet visar tydligt hur kurvorna f\u00f6r temperaturen i juni och f\u00f6r f\u00e5gelbest\u00e5ndets t\u00e4thet f\u00f6ljer varandra under den f\u00f6rsta och st\u00f6rre delen av inventeringsperioden. Detta understryker betydelsen av junitemperaturen f\u00f6r hur variationen i sm\u00e5f\u00e5gelt\u00e4theten utvecklas.\nVad g\u00e4ller relationen mellan maj-temperaturen och f\u00e5gelt\u00e4theten ger Tabell 6 inga statistiskt h\u00e5llba-ra besked och h\u00e4r skall inte spekuleras \u00f6ver m\u00f6jliga tolkningar.\nArtbest\u00e5ndens fluktuationer I Figur 5 \u00e4r de 20 vanligaste arternas fluktuationer presenterade som kurvor.

Detta \u00e4r en viktig, \u00e4nnu ej analyserad information, som erh\u00e5llits endast tack vare det fortsatta envisa f\u00e5gelr\u00e4knandet.\nVi var fr\u00e5n b\u00f6rjan s\u00e4kra p\u00e5 att endast en mycket l\u00e5ng rad av inventerade s\u00e4songer kunde ge tillf\u00f6rlit-lig information om f\u00e5gelsamh\u00e4llets reaktion p\u00e5 fj\u00e4ll-bj\u00f6rkm\u00e4tarlarvernas massupptr\u00e4danden, detta av den enkla anledningen att larvtopparna intr\u00e4ffar endast en g\u00e5ng per decennium.

Hur skall denna \"f\u00e5gelbrist\" i norr f\u00f6rklaras? Ett otvetydigt svar \u00e4r \u00e4nnu inte inom r\u00e4ckh\u00e5ll, varf\u00f6r man \u00e4r h\u00e4nvisad till gissningar.\nMan kan t\u00e4nka sig att f\u00e5glarna brister i h\u00e4cknings-effektivitet i fj\u00e4llbj\u00f6rkskogen. Mot detta talar att \u00e4ggkullarna \u00e4r stora och att \u00e4ggen hos nio unders\u00f6k-ta t\u00e4ttingarter \u00e4r lika stora eller st\u00f6rre \u00e4n dem l\u00e4ngre s\u00f6derut. H\u00e4ckningen \u00e4r ocks\u00e5 tillr\u00e4ckligt effektiv f\u00f6r att vid gynnsam temperatur i juni kunna resultera i en best\u00e5nds\u00f6kning s\u00e5som visats ovan. Att de flesta arter inte reagerar p\u00e5 det n\u00e4ringstillskott som utbrotten av m\u00e4tarlarver inneb\u00e4r tyder p\u00e5 att annan f\u00f6da finns i rikt m\u00e5tt. Man kunde tycka att best\u00e5ndet d\u00e4rmed skulle s\u00e5 sm\u00e5ningom kunna fylla biotopen till br\u00e4d-den, men s\u00e5 sker uppenbarligen inte. En fingervisning kan kanske ligga i det faktum att f\u00e5gelsamh\u00e4llet i fj\u00e4llbj\u00f6rkskogen \u00e4r p\u00e5fallande instabilt, dvs varierar kraftigt i t\u00e4thet mellan s\u00e4songer-na. J\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med f\u00e5gelt\u00e4theten i v\u00e4lunders\u00f6kta l\u00f6v-skogar i Polen \u00e4r skillnaden mellan h\u00f6gsta och l\u00e4gsta best\u00e5ndst\u00e4thet tre g\u00e5nger st\u00f6rre och st\u00f6rsta f\u00f6r\u00e4nd-ringen i t\u00e4thet fr\u00e5n den ena s\u00e4songen till n\u00e4sta fyra g\u00e5nger st\u00f6rre i norr. Det har sedan l\u00e4nge ansetts att den fr\u00e4msta orsaken h\u00e4rtill \u00e4r de ofta h\u00e4ftiga omkastningarna i v\u00e4derleksl\u00e4get i norr, samt att de extrema v\u00e4dertillst\u00e5nden har katastrofalare f\u00f6ljder f\u00f6r h\u00e4ck-ningsresultaten i norr j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med dem i s\u00f6der. Till detta kan l\u00e4ggas att den korta h\u00e4ckningss\u00e4songen i norr betyder att m\u00f6jligheten att med omh\u00e4ckning minska skadeverkningarna d\u00e4r \u00e4r betydligt mindre. Kanske \u00e4r det allts\u00e5 s\u00e5 att ofta f\u00f6rekommande utbrott av d\u00e5ligt v\u00e4der (kyla, regn, sn\u00f6) hindrar f\u00e5gelbest\u00e5n-det att \"f\u00f6r\u00f6ka upp sig\" till i niv\u00e5 med vad biotopen kan b\u00e4ra.
