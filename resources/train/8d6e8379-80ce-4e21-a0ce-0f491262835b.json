[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Agricultural production can impact water quality (Ribaudo, Horan, and Smith 1999) through chemical and fertiliser runoff, increase greenhouse gas nitrous oxide emissions (H\u00e9nault et al. 2012), harm beneficial insects (National Pesticide Information Center 2017), and some wildlife. Farmers that use precision agriculture's (PrecAg) information technologies may be better able to address environmental concerns related to their operation. Brown et al. (2016) show how PrecAg can help reduce the carbon footprint of a farm. Wolf and Nowak (1995) showed that opportunities exist to apply field collected information for intensified agrichemical management to improve environmental and economic performance of cropping systems in Wisconsin. This study extends that analysis to all U.S. rice producers and a wider range of production practices that have the potential to improve farm management to increase yields, and save costs, while improving on-farm natural resource stewardship. The question investigated is whether PrecAg might be able to provide the information to farmers to allow them to jointly pursue profit and environmental goals (Gadanakis et al. 2015;Tran and Nguyen 2008)."}, {"section_title": "Precision agricultural technologies used in rice production", "text": "VRT often uses yield/soil maps to programme machinery controllers and apply different levels of inputs at different rates across a field (Simmonds et al. 2013). Mapping is also useful in helping to identify uniform growing conditions when the implementation of VRT may not be cost effective because of the specialised fertiliser applicators and chemical sprayers needed for VRT. Recent developments that are likely to change how VRT is implemented in the future include real-time nitrogen sensing that uses vegetation indexes and data collected remotely by drones (Huang et al. 2013). Producers can also use tractor or combine auto-guidance systems that self-steer farm equipment using maps, particularly the GPS boundaries of their fields to help reduce overlaps in input applications, increasing the efficiency of input use that can lower costs or increase yields, while reducing operator fatigue. Farmers also report that they can monitor machinery operation more closely and identify problems when equipment gets out of alignment more quickly when using guidance systems (Shockley, Dillon, and Stombaugh 2011). Between 2006 and 2013, guidance use in U.S. rice production doubled ( Figure 1) while yield mapping almost doubled, and soil mapping rose to above 10% adoption. VRT had grown to just over 20% which is high compared to most other U.S. crops (Schimmelpfennig 2016). Only corn and soybeans have VRT adoption rates that are a few percentage points higher than rice. Yield and soil mapping are often used together and are combined as 'GPS mapping' for the remainder of the article. This paper fills gaps in the evaluation of PrecAg for crop production by considering total U.S. rice production, and makes links to on-farm natural resource stewardship that have not been made previously ( Figure 1)."}, {"section_title": "On-farm natural resource stewardship in rice production", "text": "The National Research Council (NRC) (2010) gives a thorough accounting of sustainable agricultural production practices. They discuss best management practices (BMPs) for nutrient control, and monitoring fields for weeds and insects before problem areas spread, and before a treatment plan might be necessary that requires recurring sprays, as well as soil care, including conservation tillage and erosion control. In a review, Udeigwe et al. (2015) identify many of these same practices as potentially having environmental and human health impacts. USDA (2012) provides a wide definition of sustainability that involves a process of 'working toward the economic, environmental, and social sustainability of diverse food, fiber, agriculture, forest, and range systems' (see also https:// www.nal.usda.gov/afsic/sustainable-agriculture-definitions-and-terms accessed Nov. 2018). The USDA's definition includes the same production practices as the NRC's BMPs. There is broad-based support from agricultural stakeholders for sustainability initiatives from groups like 'Field To Market\u00ae' that pursue production sustainability. Members of Field To Market include grower organisations, agribusinesses, food and fibre companies, conservation groups, universities, and USDA agencies. They have over 120 partners listed here https://www.fieldtomarket. org/members/ (accessed Nov. 2018). This group includes several multinational restaurant and retail companies that are interested in coordinating with Field To Market to promote, define, and measure the sustainability of rice production."}, {"section_title": "Rice production best management Practices", "text": "Soil conservation is important in rice production and is tested for links to PrecAg use. Saichuk et al. 2011 discuss no-till with water and dry seeding as two of their four rice planting BMPs. They give conservation tillage a prominent place in on-farm rice natural resource stewardship. Delgado and Berry (2008) make direct connections between conservation, PrecAg, and sustainability. The popularity of no-till, reduced till, and other conservation tillage practices have been growing with other crops, and in rice production conservation tillage helps reduce how often and how long rice paddies need to be flooded (Horowitz, Ebel, and Ueda 2010). The soil itself maintains better structure with reduced tillage systems and soil has an important role in farm ecosystems (Jonsson and Davidsdottir 2016). Erosion control is a key consideration in U.S. rice production because of the substantial water requirements of the crop and the heavy reliance on herbicides that remove other soil-holding plants from the rice field. Soil erosion from wind and water is expected to decrease with reduced tillage because less soil is exposed at the surface. Saichuk et al. (2011) link conservation practices to erosion control, and integrate filter and buffer strips into no-till schemes for controlling erosion under a variety field configurations (illustrations on p.21 of their report). Jiming, Yeyun, and Longping (2009) link erosion to long-term use of fertilisers and the popularity of hybrid rice varieties. These concerns partially motivate the development of SRI tools and sensible intensification of rice production. Another side benefit of conservation tillage, crop rotations, and erosion control is that these practices may help rice farmers meet future greenhouse gas sequestration goals by keeping more carbon in the soil (Lewandrowski et al. 2004;Saharawat et al. 2011). Soil organic matter can be composed of between 12% and over 20% organic carbon, depending on the percent clay in the mineral portion of the soil (Foth 1990, 139). Soil organic matter also depends on the length of time the soil is flooded, as hydric soils tend to lose carbon. Lal (1997) calculates a carbon sequestration rate from conservation tillage using an estimate of 15% conversion of crop residues into passive soil organic carbon in conventional crops. This percent could he higher or lower in U.S. rice production depending on how long fields are flooded, as short periods of flooding could speed up the conversion process. Another possible link investigated is whether rice farmers who use PrecAg, also use more or less within-year fertilisers than those that do not use PrecAg (Bongiovanni and Lowenberg-Deboer 2004). Fertiliser leeching is a consistent concern in many crops (Meisinger and Delgado 2002). For fertiliser monitoring, rice farmers usually only grid-sample and map pH level, phosphorous (P), and potassium (K) levels and periodically nitrogen (N), because of the expense of obtaining sufficient data points to produce an actionable GPS map. P has been identified as an off-farm water pollutant, and a primary cause of eutrophication. For this reason, Le Noe, Garnier, and Billen (2018) compare the sustainable use of P in conventional and organic cropping systems at farm and regional levels in France. Soil organic matter may also be mapped. The main feature of un-gridded nutrient tests often taken from core samples is that they provide levels of a wide-range of 10-15 nutrients and micro-nutrients. Nutrient tests can also be done on plant tissues, especially leaves, but are usually not mapped and may be done later in the season when plants have begun the tillering stage, and additional fertiliser, particularly N applications can be beneficial. Maps of remotely sensed data on leaf reflectance from satellites and airplanes provide information on chlorophyll status and hence soil nitrogen availability (Daughtry et al. 2000), and are becoming more widely adopted. Nutrient tests from sampled soil are discussed as BMPs in the literature and a few studies of this BMP mention PrecAg. Kropff, Bouma, and Jones (2001) stress spatial and temporal dimensions in stewardship, and Fountas et al. (2006) develop decision-making processes in information-intensive practices for PrecAg. Fuglie and Kascak (2001) explicitly model soil nutrient tests as a BMP. Remotely sensed data is being developed to create reflectance-based vegetation indices that may help more farmers determine rice crop moisture and nutrient requirements in the future (Kanke et al. 2016). Another set of linkages concern links between PrecAg use and rice farm involvement by crop consultants (Fountas et al. 2006, fig. 2) and other experts (Kropff, Bouma, and Jones 2001). These experts are often used in the U.S. to help interpret nutrient test results and for recommendations on chemicals for pest problems like weeds, insects, and diseases. Weed consultants in particular often offer programme packages that include multiple farm scouting visits, particularly early in the season when problems can be addressed before rice crop yields are greatly impacted. Scouting for insects helps reduce unnecessary pesticide applications, and mobile-web applications are making it easier to record pest problems by precise location in a field. Scouting reports can be created on-the-fly that use map-pin and comment-box features, and when necessary, photos can be included and the whole report shared by email. Electronic scouting forms like these are helping to standardise communications between consultants and farmers. Mahajan, Poonia, and Chauhan (2014) describe a series of interacting factors influencing high rates of chemical use in rice production. Norton et al. (2010) stress that integrated pest management (IPM) can help reduce reliance on chemicals by only targeting pests that threaten rice crop yields. Remote sensing has been discussed as a tool for weed detection (Kaur et al. 2011;Lamb and Brown 2001;Thorp and Tian 2004), but up to this point in time, heavy reliance on chemicals in the U.S. seems set to continue. Buczko, Kuchenbuch, and Lennartz (2010) consider practical tools for helping to control N run-off from fields of other crops and these are likely to influencing how farmers implement right place, right time, stewardship for nitrogen applications. Similar tools for controlling rice chemical applications will likely be developed in the future. Some BMPs require a longer view because they involve tracking the use of inputs from season-toseason and the impacts of different soil conservation practices from one year to the next. A final set of links are investigated between PrecAg use and written planning to control soil conditions, to adjust nutrient application-to-use balances, and for tracking the efficacy of pest management practices over a period of time that might be needed to fine-tune adjustments. Day-to-day production practice adjustments recommended by consultants and service providers in response to changes in weather, pest pressures, and other unforeseen events can be systematically tracked over time as a BMP (Saichuk et al. 2011). Sorensen et al. (2010) explicitly model this interaction of strategic and whole-farm planning calling it a 'future farm vision' and 'long-term farm and production information' (49). Long-run considerations play a central role in their farmer-centric model and involve changes in fertiliser, chemical and soil conservation cropping practices. For this reason, long-term planning is investigated and results for written plans are presented in the Results section with those for each of the other BMPs."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Investigating if U.S. rice farmers use BMPs more often when using PrecAg is possible using data from a USDA farm survey. Specifically, the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) is an annual survey of U.S. farms. In Phase II of ARMS, USDA selects nationally representative samples of producers of 1-2 target crops in each year, and then elicits information on input use (including the use of precision technologies), expenses, production practices, and production outcomes on a randomly selected field planted to a target crop. Rice was a target crop in 2006 and in 2013. Further information on ARMS, including copies of Phase II rice questionnaires, may be found here: https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/arms-farm-financial-and-crop-production-practices/arms- data/ (accessed Nov. 2018). Salassi and Zansler's (2000) extension report on rice production BMPs, and its recent update (Saichuk et al. 2011), provides details on the specifics of rice BMPs that provides support for the use of ARMS questions to evaluate BMPs in rice production. These practical reports on BMPs in U.S. rice production that are geared toward specific farm practices focus on soil, fertiliser, and chemical use management."}, {"section_title": "An analytical framework and farm financial data for estimation", "text": "The model used to relate BMPs to PrecAg use assumes farmers make farm input and production practice decisions based on financial considerations concerning both input costs and yields (Griffin et al. 2004). The dependent variables are total operating costs and operating profit. In this way, on-farm stewardship practices can be considered in the same empirical model as financial variables influencing the cost-effectiveness of the information technologies in crop production. All input costs (including seed, fertiliser, chemicals, fuel costs, and repairs), and the stewardship BMPs discussed in the introduction are tested as explanatory variables. Operating profit includes production output multiplied by market price giving total revenue. Overhead variables are fixed costs allocated to production that could affect technology adoption. These are tested as PrecAg technology adoption explanatory variables. They include labour, capital service flows for machinery and equipment, and the opportunity cost of land measured as the rental rate (including taxes and insurance). The estimated operating profit model for farmer i is: Operating profit i = Function of (revenue, operating costs i , production practices chosen, and factors affecting precision agriculture technology adoption), where the technology adoption equation is specified as: Technology adoption = Function of (overhead expenses i ) The operating cost dependent variable model uses all the same variables without revenue. Separate models are estimated for operating costs and operating profit giving a comparison of results for the same set of variables, but without a yield effect. Profit increases with higher yields (all else held constant), but costs might not increase with higher yields, if management of inputs and production practices are better on some rice farms. The structure of the ARMS data used in this study is documented in Schimmelpfennig (2016). For this analysis, the key point is that total U.S. rice farm operating costs and profits can be determined from all of its farm-level components. The 2013 rice survey provides over 640 observations on individual rice farm financial variables and each farm's use of crop BMPs, in addition to the size of each farm (acres farmed). For descriptive statistics for the operating cost and profit variables included in the estimated models see Table 1. These statistics are unweighted for the skewed distribution of farm sizes that is corrected on all the other tables. The unweighted numbers are shown here so that standard deviations, mins, and maximums can be shown."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Before implementing the analytical framework, a series of individual relationships are tested in this section (Tables 2-6) that show the statistical significance of differences in BMP adoption rates between farms with PrecAg technologies and farms that do not have the technologies. After establishing statistically significant correlations between PrecAg and selected BMPs, the relationships are tested together in structured, empirical treatment-effects models that include operating cost and profit data and other financial variables. Conservation tillage on Table 2 is statistically significantly higher with GPS mapping (13% more farmers use conservation tillage on their rice that use mapping), but only 3% more farmers use conservation tillage that use guidance, still a statistically significant level, and VRT users are less likely to use soil conservation at a statistically significant level. These results are consistent with other results in the soil conservation literature. Knowler and Bradshaw (2007) summarise the literature on 'conservation agriculture' noting that effective soil conservation must be 'tailored to reflect the particular conditions' (25) which supports the higher association between GPS mapping and conservation. Delgado and Berry (2008) call this 'precision conservation' and trace its history back to models of erosion, 'spatial data mining, and map analysis' (1). The fact that 88% (Table 2, right-hand column) of U.S. rice farms use one or more erosion control practices is less surprising than the fact that these practices are also associated with high levels of GPS mapping (52% more farms) and guidance (35% more farms). Percentages this high could indicate strong linkages that will be investigated by examining coefficients in the estimated empirical models. Erosion control turns out be positive and significant in all six of the treatment models (costs and profits for three PrecAg technologies) presented in the following sections. Table 3 shows percent differences in the use of close management of fertiliser between adopters and non-adopters of each of the three PrecAg technologies. Farmers that monitor their fertiliser closely, use soil testing and field operations to incorporate fertilisers into the soil on their fields. Like soil conservation, these BMPs are associated with mapping. More surprising is that VRT is negatively related to close management, but this may be because VRT is being used by rice farmers as their fertiliser management tool. Saharawat et al. (2011) discuss crop rotations as a nutrient management tool, but only 4% of U.S. rice farmers reported using changes in crop rotations to manage fertiliser use. Crop rotations often improve soil health, and change pH balance, and are considered a BMP (Saichuk et al. 2011). Crop rotations are only significantly associated with guidance systems for Pre-cAg (Table 3, lower section). Table 4 considers fertiliser control in U.S. rice production from a broader perspective than Table 3 that investigated specific tests and production practices often associated with fertiliser management. Because rice farmers may control fertiliser use through a range of production practices including more careful application or change in fertiliser type, Table 4 attempts to capture any possible practice by asking rice farmers the simple question, 'Did you make any management choices to cut back on fertilizer use?' The answers to this ARMS question, weighted to adjust for farm size, indicate that a statistically significant larger number of GPS map users answered 'yes' to this question, and a higher and significant number of guidance users did likewise. The answer from VRT users was more often 'no.'  To check the negative and significant answers to fertiliser management questions from VRT users on Tables 2 and 3, an additional variable was created that combined reasons for using less fertiliser into one yes/no answer if any or all methods were used to reduce fertiliser use, and this variable was not significant with VRT (Table 4, lower section). What this combined variable does seem to show is that the positive and significant results for GPS mapping and guidance with respect to the 'choice made to use less fertilizer' question on Table 4 (applies to 7% of farms) and 'closer management of fertilizer applications' on Table 4 (applies to 16% of farms), is robust to having the reasons combined for reducing fertiliser use (applies to 23% of farms). All three variables, 'choice made', 'closer management', and the catch-all variable are all positive and significant in the single digits for mapping and guidance. Table 5 (top section) shows the prevalence of two methods of pest monitoring for users of PrecAg compared to farmers that do not use PrecAg. Scouting for weeds as an individual activity and not as part of another field activity that can cause divided attention, is significantly higher for mapping and guidance users, but not for VRT. Mapping previous weed problems are carried out more by VRT users as well as mapping and guidance users as would be expected because GPS mappers would already have created maps, and VRT relies on those maps. These results should be interpreted keeping in mind that mapping previous weed problems ( Table 5, right-hand column) is carried out by only one-sixth as many rice farmers as reported making dedicated pest scouting trips to their fields. The prevalence of weed mapping for VRT users is just less than for guidance users, and half that of soil and yield map users. Table 5 (bottom section) shows the prevalence of two elements of pest control besides actual spraying. Use of weather data for pest control through the timing of chemical applications is significant and high for guidance users but not for either soil/yield mappers or VRT users, for whom it is actually negative. Once again VRT users are likely to have their own spraying prescriptions for VRT use that becomes their pest control strategy, and do not make use of weather data as much as non-VRT users. Since 85% of farms indicated using weather data in some way, it would make sense that a larger percentage are non-VRT users because VRT is only used on about one-fifth of rice farms. Biocontrols that make use of beneficial organisms to help manage pests are only being used on less than one-percent of all U.S. rice farms. Biocontrols have been used late in the season when minimum pesticide residue levels are a concern prior to rice crop harvest. Monitoring the natural presence of beneficial insects have often been included in integrated pest management plans (Mullen, Norton, and Reaves 1997). All of those beneficial-organism users in the rice ARMS also happen to be guidance system users (Table 5). More GPS mappers use beneficials, but the difference with those that do not is not significant, and no VRT users use beneficials. Written soil conservation plans to reduce erosion (Table 6) are used on about 7% of U.S. rice farms, and this BMP is statistically significant and about 7% higher on farms that use GPS soil/ yield mapping. Given the heavy reliance in rice production on water use, it is perhaps not surprising that written irrigation plans are also significant with all three PrecAg technologies (Table 6). Users of PrecAg have irrigation plans between 4% and 8% more often than non-users of PrecAg. IPM and nutrient management written plans are more frequently seen at a significant level with GPS mapping and guidance, but not with VRT (Table 6). This would be consistent with earlier results that found that fertiliser use on rice did not decline with VRT use for any of the four different variables used to measure fertiliser application and control."}, {"section_title": "The empirical modeltreatment effects and model diagnostic statistics", "text": "Having established statistically valid differences in BMP adoption rates between farms with PrecAg technologies and farms that do not have the technologies, this sub-section tests the BMPs together in models with operating costs, profits, and other farm financial data for the same rice farm. This empirical approach uses a structured, empirical treatment-effects model to determine if BMP adoption and on-farm stewardship of natural resources are significant in a general model of farm finances, and the sign and size of BMP use on costs and profits when PrecAg is used. To determine the impact of stewardship and PrecAg on costs and profits, factors affecting adoption (like farm size 1 and other overhead items) should first be held constant, because overhead spending can affect stewardship and other practices that will most likely affect costs and profits (Daberkow and McBride 2003). To control this confounding variables problem, a treatment-effects model is used (Imbens and Wooldridge 2009). This model is especially useful when data is available on both types of farms; those that are treated (PrecAg technology adopters) and untreated (nonadopters). The adoption measurement section is linked (using fitted values) to the cost/profitability section and estimated simultaneously using maximum likelihood. This is the same approach used by Schimmelpfennig and Ebel (2011). The results give estimated financial impacts of BMP adoption and other variables, on farms that use Pre-cAg compared to those that do not. Diagnostic statistics and specification tests for both cost and profit sets of models are in Table 7. There are six models evaluated, one for each of the three PrecAg technologies for costs and three for profits. The Wald tests for independent equations show that for each precision technology, the adoption and cost/profitability sections of the model are not independent. This is necessary when using the treatment-effects model because independent sections could be estimated alone outside of the treatment model framework. This independence test is a Chi-squared test of rho equal to zero that is rejected at high levels of significance (p values close to zero). The other Wald test reported is analogous to an F-test of joint significance of the variables, rejecting the possibility that the estimated coefficients are jointly equal to zero. Model performance is evaluated using the Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria (AIC and BIC) (Guo and Fraser 2010) because R-square coefficients of determination cannot be calculated for treatment models. The criteria are measures of combined fit and complexity, and better fitting models have smaller criteria. Both criteria are magnitudes smaller for the cost models over the profit versions, showing the negative influence of a yield effect and other profitability factors on model performance. Figure 2 shows 2013 adoption rates for the three most popular PrecAg technologies on different acre-sized rice farms. The highest adoption rates for all three technologies are on the largest farms, those between 1000 and 5000 acres of cultivated rice. Guidance system use picks up by about 10% for this largest farm category. In contrast, GPS mapping (yield and/or soil GPS mapping) reach close to their highest levels of adoption in the previous size category, which is for 500-675 acre farms. VRT reaches its minimum adoption rate in this size category, a result which stresses the point that guidance is a labour-saving convenience technology whereas VRT is the reverse. Model results at the end of this section show that VRT raises costs and provides the largest profit payoff of the three technologies. Guidance has a relatively flat adoption rate in rice farming at around 50% across all size categories."}, {"section_title": "PrecAg technology adoption and farm size", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Farm overhead costs impact PrecAg adoption", "text": "Adoption of PrecAg technologies likely has financial implications that can affect operating costs that depend largely on input application rates, and overhead costs that depend on substitutions between capital and labour. The results show that capital/labour tradeoffs are in fact the expenses that influence adoption, while input costs and stewardship practices influence operating costs and profits on farms that use PrecAg compared to those that do not. The effect of input spending and production practices are determined after changes in overhead are determined and held constant. Model diagnostics indicate that adoption influences operating costs and profits while depending on tradeoffs in the deployment of overhead. Results (Table 8) have operating costs as the dependent variable and Table 9 shows the results for operating profit. Explanatory variables on both tables are the same, and differences in coefficient estimates provide complementary insights, with reasonable explanations for the differences. The top section of both Tables 8 and 9 show how overhead expenses help explain adoption. The treatment model can isolate overhead expenses from other input choices that directly affect stewardship. Capital investments in PrecAg farm equipment can require loans or alter the financial structure of the farm business that can affect both its labour and other capital expenditures. Hired labour is positive and significant with GPS mapping, which is consistent with maps providing talking points for both farmers and the labour they hire to operate machinery, or scout for weeds, insects and diseases. Machinery and equipment, and farm size both influence PrecAg adoption, but with opposite signs. Machinery and equipment expenses are measured as its capital recovery cost. Machinery is often modelled as a substitute for labour, and in the case of GPS mapping, they do have opposite signs in both the cost and profit models. For guidance and VRT, machinery has negative signs in both the cost and profit models as would be expected since PrecAg adoption decisions have to consider pre-determined overhead costs and earlier investments in machinery could well reduce the flexibility of farm owners or managers to adopt new technologies like PrecAg. Farm size is measured in acres related to the expense of renting or owning land. In this case, since more or less land does not have to be put into production with PrecAg adoption, the larger a farm the more important effect comes from economies-of-scale associated with implementation of the PrecAg technologies. Farm size is positive and significant for all three PrecAg technologies in the cost models. Farm size is positive and significant in the mapping and VRT profit models. The non-significance of guidance in the profit model could well reflect the convenience and timesaving aspects of guidance systems that might not contribute much to profitability."}, {"section_title": "Impacts of PrecAg and sustainable practices on costs and profit", "text": "On the lower sections of both Tables 8 and 9, the 'precision technology' line shows the significance of the impact of each of the three PrecAg technologies on operating costs and profits. Interpretation of these coefficients requires converting them into average treatment effects on the treated, that take into account the correlation between the top (adoption) and bottom sections (costs or profits). These percentages are reported in Table 10, and are discussed below. The other coefficients are discussed first. Seed costs are positive, significant, and about the same size across PrecAg technologies on both tables. Fertiliser is similarly intuitive, with nutrient spending adding to costs but increasing profit as it should, all else held constant. Likewise, chemical costs are positive and significant across all six models. As long as costs increase profits, the increases in fertiliser and chemical costs may be worth it to the farm financially. The next set of coefficients show impacts of production stewardship practices. Conservation tillage is significant and lowers costs with all three PrecAg technologies, but is also significant and reduces profits. This probably means that no-till and other soil conservation practices save costs, presumably through maintenance of soil structure and lower machinery expenses, but on average this lowers operating profit in U.S. rice production in the same year. The benefit of soil conservation in increasing yields may take several years to accumulate as soil structure improves. Some soil may benefit from soil conservation more quickly, leading to more immediate gains in profit. Practices like conservation that can improve soil health, raise soil organic matter and water holding capacity could have benefits for moderating profit variability under different weather conditions, and this will be a topic for future research. Erosion control has the reverse effect of soil conservation for all three PrecAg technologies, having a significant and positive affect on costs, but also significantly raising profit. Since control measures help protect erodible soils at some cost, these results should be complementary in this way. Detailed nutrient tests that provide more information than are usually included on GPS maps are not significant in either changing costs or profits, holding the other factors in the models constant. Crop rotations in rice are usually with soybeans or wheat and should benefit the yields of both crops, but only about 4% of U.S. rice farms use this practice. Crop rotation is nevertheless significant for all three PrecAg technologies and reduces costs, but is not significant for profits. Similarly, the estimated cost effect of 'choosing to use less fertilizer' is negative and significant, with cost savings in materials clearly a benefit, but the impact on profit is not significant. 'Dedicated field scouting' has a similar negative and significant impact on costs for all three PrecAg technologies, but has a negative and significant impact on profit. This seems to indicate that farm or hired scouts are saving input costs perhaps because treatments can be limited to identified problem areas. The drop in profit with scouting probably means that even with better identification of pest problem areas, damage to the crop and some drop in yields is inevitable with a pest problem. Finally, after controlling for all factors it might still be expected that written planning might affect costs and profits but is not significant on costs, negative, and significant on profit with GPS mapping and guidance. One explanation for this could be that the true impact of written planning is difficult to discern in one year of data (2013) and would become more obvious over time, as production practices are adjusted appropriately. These estimated results should not be interpreted as estimated impacts of BMPs on farm natural resources. These results show positive or negative impacts of BMPs on costs or profits. The total value of BMPs on farm ecosystem services would need to come from different modelling frameworks. The last table of results (Table 10) shows the average treatment-effect on the treated (PrecAg adopters) in terms of operating costs and profits, after controlling for use of production stewardship best-management practices. VRT has the largest average positive effect on operating profit in U.S. rice production (over 9%), but this comes with a large (5%) increase in costs, holding other input costs and production stewardship practices constant. This would confirm the casual observation Table 10. Percentage impacts of PrecAg on farm operating costs and operating profit."}, {"section_title": "GPS soil/yield mapping", "text": "Guidance system VRT Percentage change in costs/profits from adopting Operating Cost Impact of Precision Technology from Treatment Model -3.30% -2.03% 5.06% Operating profit impact 3.34% -5.79% 9.40% Source: USDA Economic Research Service estimates using data from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) Phase II and III. Average treatment effect estimates corrected for correlation between adoption and profit/cost sections of each treatment model (Tables 8 and 9). that VRT takes time and effort, as well as additional capital costs to implement but may benefit the bottom line on the farm. Guidance systems lower operating costs, probably by paying for the additional capital costs incurred by increasing the accuracy of input applications that reduce overlaps and end-of-row cutoffs. The average impact on profits is negative, but the popularity of automated steering could reflect the value farmers place on risk reduction (Shockley, Dillon, and Stombaugh 2011), convenience, and lower stress that has been associated with guidance. GPS mapping shows the largest cost savings and has a positive yield and profit impact. This Pre-cAg technology creates new information about the impacts of production practices that can be used to both lower costs and increase profit. The advantage that GPS mapping has over the other PrecAg technologies is the smaller capital requirement, relying more on computer expertise and selecting useful data to collect and map."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This paper links on-farm natural resource stewardship to the three most popular tools of PrecAg; soil and yield mapping using global positioning systems (GPS), that can also be used to operate tractor guidance systems, and variable rate input-application technologies (VRT). By utilising data from USDA's ARMS, this study is the first to examine PrecAg use in aggregate U.S. rice production and combines detailed field-level production practice information with financial data from a large sample of rice-farms. These PrecAg technologies were used on 21-53% of planted U.S. rice acres in 2013, a significant uptick from the adoption rates in 2006 of 6-26%. PrecAg is linked to stewardship through BMPs including conservation tillage and erosion control, nutrient-level monitoring and control, crop rotations, scouting for weeds, soil tests, and longer-term written production plans. Capital investments in equipment are required for most PrecAg applications, so adoption is linked to changes in farm overhead, input costs, and operating profit. The empirical model is a treatment-effects model that controls for factors affecting adoption separately, but not independently, of input use and other production practices. The estimates for BMPs show significant links to operating costs and profits. The conclusion from the analysis is that profitable and cost-effective implementation of PrecAg in rice production improves average on-farm natural resource stewardship, and lowers the environmental burden of intensive crop management practices."}, {"section_title": "Note", "text": ""}]
