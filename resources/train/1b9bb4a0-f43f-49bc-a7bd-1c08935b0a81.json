There is growing emphasis on the preclinical phase of AD as a starting point for clinical trials of antiamyloid agents with the goal of halting the disease before the development of clinical symptoms [2] . Although it is recognized that cognitive decline in preclinical AD most likely reflects multiple biological changes, studies and clinical trials often require only Ab1 for the classification of preclinical AD. In this context, developing accurate estimates of Ab1-related cognitive change in cognitively normal (CN) older adults is essential. However, the precise nature and magnitude of Ab1-related cognitive decline differs between studies [3] [4] [5] [6] . One possible reason for this difference is that neuropsychological study of preclinical AD has more in common with the study of aging than the study of dementia. Thus, issues known to influence or inflate estimates of age-related cognitive change in CN older adults might also increase the estimates of Ab1-related cognitive decline in preclinical AD [7, 8] .\nOne factor that may influence estimates of Ab1-related cognitive decline is progression from preclinical AD to a clinical disease stage (i.e., mild cognitive impairment [MCI] or dementia). Although studies of preclinical AD exclude individuals who meet clinical criteria for MCI or dementia at enrollment or baseline assessment, rates of clinical disease progression during prospective studies are consistently large (e.g., 10 [10] , and 6.1% in Mayo Clinic Study of Aging samples [11] ). Estimates of Ab1-related cognitive decline derived from samples that include high rates of clinical disease progression might therefore be inflated. When assessed on a single occasion, CN Ab1 adults generally show no cognitive impairment relative to matched Ab2 adults [12] [13] [14] . Thus, it is possible that in the absence of any clinical disease progression, Ab1 might be associated with only small, or even no, cognitive decline in CN older adults.\nThe inclusion of individuals with severe or uncontrolled systemic illnesses in study samples may also inflate estimates of Ab1-related cognitive decline. In older adults, systemic illnesses, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension, show increased prevalence and are associated with subtle cognitive impairment [15, 16] . Given their high prevalence in aging, epidemiological studies of preclinical AD include large proportions of individuals with these systemic illnesses [17] . In addition, the published criteria for most experimental samples do not specify whether such conditions have been excluded or state these are excluded only if they prevent longitudinal assessment (e.g., ADNI or Knight ADRC [5, 10, 18] ). As such, inclusion of older adults with systemic illness in studies of preclinical AD may have led to inflated estimates of Ab1-related cognitive decline.\nFinally, the accuracy of estimates of Ab1-related cognitive decline might be reduced by the use of neuropsychological tests that are not appropriate for use with CN older adults. Many studies of preclinical AD use neuropsychological tests selected for their sensitivity to the substantial cognitive impairment associated with dementia (e.g., Clock Drawing, Boston Naming Test, or Mini-Mental Status Examination [MMSE] [4, 10, 19, 20] ). When such tests are applied in CN samples, the resulting data distributions are often characterized by negative skew, ceiling effects, and restriction of range [21] [22] [23] . Consequently, random error is biased toward the negative end of measurement scales inflating estimates of cognitive decline [24] .\nTo obtain unbiased estimates of Ab1-related cognitive decline, appropriate neuropsychological tests should be applied prospectively to Ab1 CN adults, who do not progress to clinical AD during the study period, and who do not have severe systemic illness. In other neuropsychological contexts, samples that exclude data from individuals who later meet clinical criteria for cognitive impairment or dementia are defined as robust samples [25] . Group mean performance on neuropsychological tests in robust samples is generally superior and has reduced variability compared with estimates from conventional normative samples [26, 27] . Therefore, application of the neuropsychological robust sample method may provide more accurate estimates of the nature and magnitude of Ab1-related cognitive decline in preclinical AD.\nThe aim of this study was to determine the nature and magnitude of Ab1-related cognitive decline and impairment, in the absence of clinical disease progression and other illnesses, such as systemic illness, that are associated with older age. Although Ab1 is unlikely to be the sole causative factor for cognitive decline and likely interacts with other markers of AD, such as tau and neurodegeneration, it is necessary for the classification of preclinical AD and has been shown to be a strong predictor of cognitive decline. By developing accurate estimates of Ab1-related cognitive decline, a solid framework can be established to then further investigate the contribution of other factors. It was hypothesized that the Ab1 CN older adults would show subtle cognitive decline relative to the Ab2 CN older adults. The second hypothesis was that Ab1 CN older adults would show no cognitive impairment relative to the Ab2 CN older adults."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Participants were recruited from the AIBL study inception cohort (Fig. 1 summarizes the method used to select participants). The AIBL sample and methodology have been described in detail previously [28] . The AIBL study was approved by three institutional research and ethics committees (St Vincent's Health, Austin Health, and Edith Cowan University). All participants provided written informed consent before participating in the study. Exclusion criteria included a history of non-AD dementia, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, cancer (other than basal skin carcinoma) within the last 2 years, uncontrolled diabetes, current depression (indicated by a Geriatric Depression Scale score .5), or current regular alcohol consumption exceeding two standard drinks per day for women or four per day for men according to recommended consumption levels from the Australian Alcohol Guidelines [29] .\nThe current health status of participants at baseline was also reviewed. All participants were determined to have no, or only subclinical and medically well controlled, systemic or neurological illness on the basis of a medical examination including measurement of vital signs (height, weight, blood pressure, and abdominal circumference), blood pathology, and medical history. Participants who later withdrew from the AIBL study for reasons of ill health (e.g., cancer or stroke) were also excluded from the current analyses.\nThe sample included 335 CN older adults aged between 60 and 85 years.

Data were then summed and normalized to obtain the SUV ratio (SUVR) using the cerebellar cortex as reference region for PiB, the whole cerebellum for FBP, and the pons for FLUTE [32, 33] . A linear regression transformation was then applied to the SUVR scores for FBP and FLUTE to transform them into a \"PiB-like\" SUVR unit termed \"Before the Centiloid Kernel Transformation\" [33] .

Nonparametric testing was used for these variables.\nFirst, independent-sample t-tests were used to compare the Ab2 and Ab1 groups on demographic and clinical characteristics. Where outcome data were not normally distributed, a Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the groups, or where data were categorical, a c 2 test was used. Second, a series of linear mixed model analyses were conducted to model the rate of change over time in cognitive function for each of the Ab groups. Ab group, time (baseline, 18, 36, 54, and 72 months), and the time ! Ab group interaction were entered as fixed factors; participants and time as random factors; and performance on each of the neuropsychological tests as the dependent variable. Age and APOE \u03b54 status were included as covariates to account for their potential to influence cognitive performance in CN older adults. Cohen's d effect size measure of standardized mean difference was then calculated to determine the magnitude of the difference in rate of change in cognitive function between Ab groups.\nThird, a series of one-way analysis of covariance were used to determine the impact of Ab on each cognitive test at the baseline assessment.

Relative to the Ab2 group, the Ab1 group showed decline over 72 months in verbal learning, episodic memory, and attention. Despite the exclusion of individuals whose disease had progressed to MCI or dementia, Ab1-associated cognitive decline was small to moderate in magnitude (e.g., Cohen's d between 20.31 and 20.50; summarized in Fig. 2 ) with the greatest decline observed for verbal episodic memory. These estimates of Ab1-related memory decline accord with estimates from recent metaanalyses of cognitive decline in preclinical AD, which found Ab1 was associated with small to moderate cognitive decline (Cohen's d between 20.24 and 20.30) over an average of 5 years [6] . They also support brain-behavior models of early AD, which propose that disruption to episodic memory, due to the early predilection for Abrelated cell death in the medial temporal lobes, is the earliest clinical manifestation of AD [1] . Although the magnitude of the cognitive decline observed in the current robust sample is consistent with that observed previously [4, 6, 44] , the nature of Ab1-related decline observed here was qualitatively different. For example, in the present study, Ab1-related decline was observed for aspects of episodic memory, including verbal list learning, visual pattern separation, and paragraph learning, as well as for aspects of attention (Table 3) . However, previous studies report Ab1 to also be associated with decline in global cognition, visuospatial function, and executive function [4, 6, 45, 46] . Notably, the sample size of the present study is similar or larger than that of previous studies (excluding meta-analyses), and the effect sizes for those tests where there was an absence of significant Ab-related cognitive decline were predominantly trivial and small at best. This suggests that a failure to detect Ab-related cognitive decline on these measures was not due to insufficient statistical power. One possible reason for the absence of decline in these same domains in this study may be that the neuropsychological tests used had optimal psychometric properties for the assessment of CN older adults. For example, in previous studies, the use of tests that generate data distributions characterized by skew or restricted range (e.g., Clock Drawing, Boston Naming Test, or MMSE) may have resulted in random error in the data distribution that is biased to the negative end of the measurement scale and consequently increased group estimates of Ab1-related decline for those measures [21, 23, 24] .\nQualitative differences in Ab1-related cognitive decline between this and previous studies may also be due to the absence of any clinical disease progression in the current sample. Previous studies include a relatively high proportion (e.g., w10%) of individuals who progressed to clinical disease during the study period. Pathological studies indicate that during the earliest stages of AD, the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, which subserve episodic memory function, are most affected [47] . However, as the disease progresses, the limbic system and neocortex become involved [47] . Hence, the absence of decline in executive and visuospatial function may reflect the very early stage of disease in the current sample. A third possibility is that the more diverse Ab1-related cognitive decline observed in previous studies reflects the presence of uncontrolled or severe systemic illness in these samples. For example, epidemiological studies, such as the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, deliberately include high proportions of individuals who have one or more systemic illnesses due to their high prevalence in older adults [17] . Other experimental or natural history samples often do not specify whether such conditions were excluded (e.g., ADNI or Knight ADRC [5, 10] ). Systemic illnesses are prevalent in older adults and have been shown to be associated with reduced cognitive function [15] . Given this, it is possible that in prior studies such illnesses influenced the nature of cognitive decline in preclinical AD. The results of the present study highlight the potential of the robust sample method for enhancing estimates of cognitive decline and for examining changes occurring in the earliest disease stages.\nThe second hypothesis that Ab1 CN older adults would show no cognitive impairment relative to the Ab2 CN older adults was partially supported. Consistent with prior studies, there were no, or only small, significant differences in performance observed between the Ab groups on the neuropsychological tests [12] [13] [14] . Furthermore, effect sizes for the group differences were uniformly trivial to small (Fig. 3) , indicating that the absence of statistically significant group differences was not due to low statistical power. Although meta-analytic investigations do suggest that Ab1 is associated with a small to moderate cognitive impairment (e.g., Cohen's d 5 0.26 to 0.47) of global cognition, visuospatial function, processing speed, executive function, and episodic memory in CN older adults, none of the samples submitted to meta-analyses could be considered robust [6, 48] . Thus, data from the present study suggest that Ab1-associated cognitive impairment in CN older adults may have been overestimated previously.\nAlthough the results of the present study provide an indication of the effect of Ab1 on cognitive function for CN older adults, independent of systemic illness or progression to clinical AD, they should be interpreted in the context of several limitations. The Ab status of a large proportion of the sample (67.5%) was not able to be determined at baseline, as those participants did not undergo neuroimaging until a later follow-up assessment. However, given the relatively slow rate of accumulation of Ab in CN individuals (e.g., mean increase of 0.02 in SUVR per year [49] ), it is unlikely that any individual who was identified at Ab1 on the basis of a scan at follow-up would not have also been Ab1 at baseline. In addition, the AIBL sample is a convenience sample and as such may not be representative of the broader population of older adults in Australia specifically, or developed countries more generally. This is especially the case after exclusion of CN older adults with severe or uncontrolled systemic illness. Related to this, the application of the robust sampling method and rigorous health criteria applied in the present study raises the issue of whether such samples, particularly Ab2 CN older adults, should be considered as representative of super aging or successful aging rather than normal aging [7, 50] . However, in the absence of any clear neuropsychological criteria for super or successful aging, this is not currently able to be determined. Although the representativeness of this sample is limited, the data from the study do show clearly that in the absence of more advanced disease or comorbid illnesses, high Ab is associated with moderate cognitive decline, but not impairment, in CN older adults. The cognitive decline observed in the present study may be reflective of the influence of Ab on cognition, however, may also be indicative of the interaction of Ab and other factors. There is increasing emphasis on the importance of the role of tau and other indicators of neurodegeneration for predicting clinical disease progression and cognitive decline in AD [3, 11, 51] . The aim of this study was not to investigate these relationships, but rather to provide a foundation for future investigations, by first establishing accurate estimates of the relationship between Ab and cognitive decline independent of clinical disease progression and comorbid illness. It would be useful for future studies to now consider the potential for tau or neurodegeration markers to modify these estimates of Ab1-related cognitive decline in robust samples of healthy older adults.

Systematic review: The authors reviewed the literature using sources such as PubMed, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO. There is consensus that elevated amyloid b (Ab1) is associated with cognitive decline in healthy older adults, the nature and magnitude of this varies between studies. This may be because preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) samples often include individuals with comorbid medical illness or whose disease progresses during the study period; both factors will increase estimates of cognitive decline. These relevant studies are appropriately cited.\n2. Interpretation: Moderate decline in attention, learning, and memory occurred in the robust sample of Ab1 cognitively normal older adults. This finding confirms that Ab1 is sufficient to cause cognitive decline in older adults.\n3. Future directions: Future studies should investigate Ab1-related cognitive decline in robust samples of preclinical AD with specific comorbid systemic illnesses, as well as interaction with other AD biomarkers."}]
