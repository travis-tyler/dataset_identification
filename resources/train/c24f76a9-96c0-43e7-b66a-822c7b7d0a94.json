Anthropogenic pressures, including increased urbanization and more intensive agricultural production, have led to degraded water quality conditions throughout the watershed (Phillips, 2007) . The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has classified Chesapeake Bay as \"impaired\" by sediment and nutrients, and implemented Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) for nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2010a).\nA variety of best management practices (BMPs) are often used to mitigate nutrient and sediment loadings in order to meet the TMDL regulatory requirements. These Best Management Practices (BMPs) are an important part of Chesapeake Bay restoration efforts; however, further information to quantify their effects on nutrient and sediment loads is/will be required to improve the targeting of management actions across the watershed. Whereas field-scale assessments of BMP effectiveness exist, few regional-scale estimates of the effects of BMPs on nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment loads delivered to streams are available (Liu and others, 2017) .\nThe seven major jurisdictions in the Chesapeake Bay report BMP implementation to the Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) annually. The major jurisdictions are New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, West Virginia, Virginia, and the District of Columbia ( fig. 1 ). The CBP has agreed upon a set of BMPs that are considered effective for reducing nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment loads. The CBP and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) have collaborated to develop a deterministic model (the Phase 5.3.2 Watershed Model) to quantify how water quality in the Chesapeake Bay watershed responds to changes in watershed and airshed management actions as well as changes in nutrient sources and other factors (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2010b).\nThe effectiveness of BMPs and individual BMP types has not been extensively studied or quantified in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The evaluation of BMP implementation data, including the spatial locations, temporal patterns, and their modeled effects on nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment that is delivered to streams, provide much needed insight on the effectiveness of management strategies. The USGS has collaborated with the CBP to assess the amount of BMP implementation over time and estimate the changes in water quality attributable to these management actions."}, {"section_title": "Purpose and Scope", "text": "This report describes the spatial and temporal patterns of BMP implementation across the Chesapeake Bay watershed from 1985 through 2014. Methods to estimate the effect of BMP implementation on nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment loads also are described. Additionally, the effect of individual BMP types on nutrient loads is estimated.\nThe CBP selected 2017 as a midpoint assessment of the TMDLs. The TMDLs were designed to have all jurisdictions implement reduction strategies by 2025, so that the bay will attain its water-quality goals. The midpoint assessment period was designated to assess progress in meeting reduction strategy goals and to evaluate recent science that may indicate necessary changes to those strategies (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2010a).\nA companion dataset to this report is available at (https:// doi.org/10.5066/P9OVU9PX) and includes detailed descriptions of BMP types as well as tables of model output at a selection of spatial scales (Devereux and others, 2018) . "}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Reporting of Best Management Practice (BMP) Implementation", "text": "The seven major jurisdictions in the Chesapeake Bay watershed (New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, West Virginia, Virginia, and the District of Columbia) began reporting estimates of BMP implementation to the CBP in the late 1990s, and have provided estimates of all BMP implementation for each year from 1985 through 2014. CBP BMP data include State and Federally funded implementation data as well as practices funded by non-governmental organizations and voluntary implementation (Hively and others, 2013) . The reporting for each year consists of all BMPs in the Chesapeake Bay watershed that were considered effective for that year, including active BMPs that have been installed in prior years. Structural BMPs, like animal waste management systems, can reduce pollutant runoff for many years. Other BMPs, like urban filtering practices, must be inspected and maintained each year to be effective (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2010b). Approximately 150 different types of BMPs were reported in 2014. For this report, the CBP provided BMP implementation data that were submitted by jurisdictions for assessment using the Phase 5.3.2 Watershed Model. The data were from annual scenarios for 1985 through 2014.\nThe various BMP types were grouped into 55 BMP categories for evaluation, and included BMPs for both agricultural and developed land (table 1). The categories were determined by the similarity of the BMPs. For example, there are approximately 100 different types of agricultural cover crops that represent various planting dates, planting methods, and crop types (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2010b). Planting dates are early, standard, or late, and reflect the planting time in relation to the first killing frost. The timing affects the successful establishment of the crop. The planting methods include drilled, aerial, or other, and can affect how well the seeds germinate. Cover crop types include various varieties such as rye, wheat, tillage radish, and many more. The various types of cover crops are presumed to have a similar effect on water quality in the Phase 5.3.2 Watershed Model. For the purposes of this report and the analysis methods used, evaluating each cover crop type individually did not result in an improved understanding of BMP implementation trends or their effects on water quality. The types of cover crops reported vary in large part by each state's ability to track that level of detail. All cover crops were therefore grouped into a single category to more clearly evaluate their expected effect on nutrient and sediment loads to streams. Similar grouping occurred for several other agricultural and developed BMPs.\nBMPs were reported at multiple spatial scales including counties, watersheds, and states. The jurisdictions have different reporting methods and are not necessarily consistent among states, BMPs, or reporting years. The CBP compiles most of the annual reported BMP implementation at the landriver segment modeling unit (average size 26.2 square miles) that is used in the CBP Partnership Phase 5.3.2 Watershed Model (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2010b). Animal data in the CBP model originates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Statistics Service and is only available at the county scale. Therefore, the BMPs that impact manure nutrients, such as animal feed additives or animal waste management systems, are compiled at the county scale. Depending on the type of BMP, implementation may be reported in a variety of units, including acres, animal units (1,000 pounds of live animal), feet, or pounds.\nThe CBP BMP data require careful interpretation. In some major jurisdictions, there are BMPs with large shifts in the levels of reported implementation from year to year. These can reflect changes in reporting standards rather than changes in the actual practice implementation. Changes in reporting occur as the jurisdictions change their tracking systems, improve their understanding of the BMP functions in the context of the modeling system, and as the BMPs themselves are re-evaluated and re-defined. In addition, the establishment of the Chesapeake Bay TMDL in 2010 resulted in a revision of reported BMP implementation from 2006 by the jurisdictions in the Chesapeake Bay watershed (Wastewater Technical Workgroup, 2013 ). An increase in reported implementation from 2006 to 2014 may be a result of revised interpretation of historical records in addition to increased implementation. Although changes in reporting standards and evaluating processes have occurred during the multi-year compilation of the CBP BMP data, the dataset is thorough and extensive, and can be used to estimate the effect of BMPs on water quality.\nAll BMPs types are periodically reevaluated by the CBP Partnership expert panels, which can result in changing names and definitions. For this analysis, all BMP implementation types were related to the closest equivalent of the 2014 BMP definitions. For example, the nutrient management BMPs used in this analysis are the efficiency versions of Tier 1, enhanced, and decision nutrient management BMPs (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2010b).\nAn estimate of the intensity of BMP implementation for the year 2014 for each land-river modeling segment was calculated by dividing the amount of reported implementation of selected BMPs as reported in the Phase 5.3.2 Watershed Model by the available land acres of the relevant land use. For example, acres of cover-crop implementation were divided by acres of cropland, and acres of pasture fencing were divided by acres of pasture land. "}, {"section_title": "Watershed Model", "text": "The CBP Partnership Phase 5.3.2 Watershed Model was used to evaluate the effects of BMPs on water quality. The model, in part, assists CBP decision-makers in estimating the collective actions needed to achieve State and Federal waterquality standards necessary to restore the health of Chesapeake Bay. The model is built through community and participatory input and used for decision-support purposes by the jurisdictions in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. It is designed to address questions of how Chesapeake Bay water quality will respond to changes in watershed and airshed management actions (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2010b).\nThe CBP model can provide estimates of nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment stream loads generated from sources such as manure, fertilizer, atmospheric deposition, wastewater, and urban areas. Other factors included in the model can determine the amount of each source that is transported to streams. These input variables were mostly estimated at the land-river segment scale, but county-level estimates based on compilations of available data also were used. The model generates annual estimates of nutrient and sediment loads at the landriver segment spatial scale for the years from 1985 to 2014. For this report, loads were summed from these smaller units to 11 geographic regions across the Chesapeake Bay watershed. These include the watersheds for the nine River Input Modeling (RIM) stations and areas on the Eastern and Western Shore of Chesapeake Bay downstream from the RIM stations ( fig. 1) . The estimated loads used in this report are considered edgeof-stream and do not include in-stream processing or decay during movement to tidal waters. Edge-of-stream is defined as the edge of a large stream, typically a fourth-order stream, for a total of about a thousand stream segments in the model (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2010b). This is determined for each stream based on streamflow and the distance to a monitoring station.\nA variety of factors, such as groundwater lag times and other response lags, may not be fully represented in yearly model predictions. The model is intended to provide quantitative measures of progress in achieving water-quality goals in the distant future using the most complete dataset of reported BMP implementation available for the region described in this report. Furthermore, the wide variety of BMP actions may result in varied model accuracy due to the different modes of action of each BMP type and the interaction of soil type, geology, precipitation, maintenance, and other factors. The model may be a better predictor of the effect of one BMP type compared to another BMP type (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2010b).\nThe estimated effect of BMPs on nutrients and sediment were modeled as a nonlinear cascading system (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2010b). There were no predetermined nitrogen, phosphorus, or sediment reductions for each BMP in all situations. The amount of nutrient and sediment reduction per unit of BMP is contingent on the land use it is applied to, other BMPs used in the area, and additional factors such as the amount of nutrient inputs on the land surface. Although there are effectiveness values for most of the BMPs in the CBP model, the total effect of BMPs cannot be calculated with these values alone. The model output can also be used to estimate the total summed effect of all load reductions from all BMPs by each land-use category.\nThe CBP model can be run for a variety of scenarios. For this study, \"Progress\" scenarios, representing an estimate of watershed conditions and all reported BMP implementation, were run for each year from 1985 to 2014. \"Baseline\" scenarios, also referred to as \"No Action\" scenarios, were also run for each year from 1985 to 2014. All of the conditions in the yearly No Action scenarios are the same as those in the corresponding yearly Progress scenarios, however, BMPs are excluded. This ensures that the full estimated effect of all BMPs on nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment for each year from 1985 to 2014 can be calculated by subtracting the loads from the No Action scenario model results from the Progress scenario model results. A prediction of atmospheric deposition of nitrogen for the year 2025 (the target date for full TMDL implementation) was used for all scenarios to remove the effects of changing air quality from the study (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2010a)."}, {"section_title": "Isolation Scenarios", "text": "In addition to the yearly Progress and No Action scenarios, a set of 35 isolation model scenarios was designed to run in series to isolate the effect of individual BMPs reported in the 2014 Progress Review. The order and design of the isolation scenarios were consistent with the way that BMPs are credited by the CBP in the Phase 5.3.2 Watershed Model, and could not be generalized to other models where BMPs are credited differently. Each scenario builds on the next following the logic used in crediting the BMPs.\nTo ensure that the BMP effects were isolated, it was necessary to assume identical initial conditions for all other variables in a scenario. Initial conditions from the 2014 Progress scenario of the CBP model were used and include, in part, 2014 model year land use, 2014 model year number of animals, and 2014 model year number of septic systems. The 2014 model year land use is an estimate based on a projection of historical land-use data. The historical land uses were developed primarily from remote sensing data and Census of Agriculture information, and included changes to land use that resulted from BMPs, such as forest buffers and changes due to development (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2010b).\nThe baseline isolation scenario does not have any BMPs active in the model and is identical to the No Action scenario. Subsequent scenarios add the various land-use change BMPs to the baseline scenario whereas all prior BMPs are kept in the subsequent scenario. Thus, the last one in the sequence has all land-use change BMPs included. Scenarios including feed additive BMPs and manure transport were added to the scenario with all land-use change BMPs following the sequence in the scenario list. The final scenario has all the land-use change BMPs, agricultural load reduction BMPs, and manure transport included.\nBMPs that utilize reduction efficiencies or direct load reductions in the model were added individually to the scenario with the land-use change BMPs, animal BMPs, and manure transport. Each scenario has one efficiency or load reduction BMP in addition to the land-use change BMPs, animal BMPs, and manure transport. A BMP that affects developed land uses can be used in the same scenario as another BMP that affects agricultural land uses because neither BMP affects the land-use loads for the other BMP in that scenario."}, {"section_title": "Estimating Load Reduction for Each Best Management Practice (BMP)", "text": "The results from the isolation scenarios provided an estimated nutrient and sediment load reduction for each BMP in all of the 11 different geographic regions described earlier as well as the entire Chesapeake Bay watershed. These estimated reductions were the effect of individual BMP types run in specific scenarios, and cannot directly be used to determine the impact on water quality in a stream. Instead, the percent reduction by BMP in nutrient and sediment loads is used to estimate the expected reduction on agricultural or developed land. For each land-use sector, the percent reduction from a BMP from the isolation scenarios is multiplied by the total combined effect of BMPs from the Progress and No Action scenarios. This value can then be divided by the total amount of implementation for an estimate of pounds of nitrogen, phosphorus, or sediment reduced per unit of BMP implemented: The estimate of reduction load per unit of implementation was developed using the 2014 model year. To determine the expected effect of each BMP type for each year from 1985 to 2014, this value was multiplied by the amount of implementation and normalized by the total estimated reduction from BMPs by sector from the No Action and Progress scenarios for the same year. This logic was consistent as long as BMPs in earlier years were also included in the 2014 Progress scenario, and the mix of BMPs and relative amount of BMPs to each other remains similar to the 2014 Progress scenario. A future implementation plan with several types of innovative practices and programs may not meet these criteria as there may be BMP types and interactions between them that can't be accounted for with this method."}, {"section_title": "Spatial Patterns of Best Management Practice (BMP) Implementation in 2014", "text": "The Potomac River subregion, defined in this report as the watershed upstream of the USGS streamgage at Chain Bridge ( fig. 1 , site 2), makes up 18 percent of the total area in the Chesapeake Bay watershed and accounts for 32 percent of the total nitrogen reduction due to agricultural BMPs, 38 percent of the phosphorus reduction due to agricultural BMPs, and 30 percent of the sediment reduction due to agricultural BMPs (table 2) . Approximately 19 percent of the total crop area, 36 percent of the total pasture area, and 27 percent of the total animal feeding operation areas of the Chesapeake Bay watershed are in the Potomac subregion. In contrast, the James River subregion makes up 10 percent of the total area in the Chesapeake Bay watershed and accounts for only 2 percent of the total agricultural nitrogen reduction due to BMPs, 6 percent of the phosphorus reduction, and 15 percent of the sediment reduction. In general, the remaining subregions were estimated to have a share of the total reductions in nutrient loads due to BMPs that are similar to their share of land area in the watershed.\nThe BMPs with the most reported acres of implementation in the Chesapeake Bay watershed in 2014 were conservation plans, conservation tillage, and tier 1 nutrient management plans (table 3) . These three BMPs totaled nearly 8,000,000 acres of implementation across the watershed and accounted for roughly two-thirds of agricultural BMP implementation. BMP implementation varied spatially across the watershed, however. BMP implementation generally reflected the typical land use in different regions. Implementation of BMPs designed to reduce nutrient and sediment loads from animal production were more often reported in areas with larger numbers of animal-based agriculture. A high intensity of conservation tillage is located on the Eastern and Western Shore of Chesapeake Bay as well as along parts of the Susquehanna River ( fig. 2A ).

Extensive cover crop implementation was reported in Maryland; approximately 71 percent of 423,283 reported cover crop acres were in Maryland ( fig. 2C) . Pennsylvania, in general, had limited reporting of BMP implementation on cropland. Although it accounts for approximately 41 percent of the crop area in the watershed, only 33 percent of the conservation tillage, 35 percent of the conservation plan, and 22 percent of the tier 1 nutrient management plan BMPs were reported in the State.

In general, the largest reductions in nutrient and sediment loads were predicted on the Eastern Shore of Chesapeake Bay and in parts of Virginia and West Virginia. Nutrient and sediment loads in areas of the watershed that have large amounts of forest land use were not predicted to have reductions of more than 5 percent (figs. 3B and 3C). These areas were estimated to have relatively low loading rates in comparison to the rest of the watershed. fig. 4A ). Phosphorus loads to streams from 1985 to 2014 were estimated to have decreased by 21 percent due to land-use changes, nutrient input changes not related to BMPs, and wastewater treatments, with an additional 19-percent reduction in phosphorus estimated due to the implementation of BMPs ( fig. 4B ). Land-use changes during this period were estimated to account for about 1 percent of the reduction in sediment loads, with a further reduction of 23 percent estimated from BMPs ( fig. 4C ).

In some subregions, such as the Susquehanna, the change in estimated reductions between 2005 and 2014 were more pronounced than others where estimated improvements were minimal. Nitrogen loads in the Eastern Shore subregion were estimated to have been reduced 18 percent through 2005 and 25 percent through 2014, representing a substantial increase in BMP implementation. In comparison, nitrogen loads to streams in the Susquehanna subregion were estimated to be reduced by 8 percent through 2005 and 9 percent through 2014. All subregions saw marked improvement in total phosphorus and sediment loads to streams between 2005 reduction of total phosphorus to streams through 2005 to a 32-percent reduction through 2014. Across the entire Chesapeake Bay watershed, BMPs were estimated to have reduced total nitrogen loads to streams by about 49 million pounds by 2014 on the approximately 9 million acres of agricultural land. BMPs on the approximately 5.4 million acres of developed lands were estimated to reduce total nitrogen loads to streams by approximately 7 million pounds in 2014. By 2000, BMPs on agricultural land were estimated to reduce total nitrogen loads to streams by 22 million pounds, whereas BMPs on developed land were estimated to reduce total nitrogen loads by about 4 million pounds ( fig. 5A ).

The largest estimated reduction in total nitrogen loads on agricultural lands in 2014 can be attributed to the land retirement BMP, with a total reduction of 7.7 million pounds, and the animal waste management system (AWMS) BMP, with an estimated reduction of 7.6 million pounds ( fig. 6A ). Conservation tillage was estimated to reduce total nitrogen loads by 6.2 million pounds for 2014. The AWMS BMP was estimated to reduce total phosphorus loads to streams by the greatest amount, with a roughly 1.4 million-pound reduction. Other large estimated reductions in phosphorus were attributable to pasture fencing (810,000 pounds) and phytase feed additives (710,000 pounds) ( fig. 6B ). The largest estimated reductions in sediment loads were due to conservation tillage (1.2 billion pounds), pasture fencing (500 million pounds), and conservation plans (480 million pounds) ( fig. 6C) .\nThe average expected effect of each type of agricultural BMP per unit of implementation on nutrient and sediment loads across the Chesapeake Bay watershed also was estimated (table 5). The agricultural BMPs that were estimated to produce the largest reduction in total nitrogen load per acre of implementation were loafing lot management and barnyard runoff controls, with estimated reductions of 110 pounds per acre and 99 pounds per acre of implementation, respectively. The loafing lot management BMP is a practice that is designed to stabilize areas that are intensively used by people, animals, or vehicles by establishing vegetative cover, surfacing with suitable materials, or installing needed structures. Barnyard runoff control includes practices such as control of runoff from barnyards, roof runoff control, and diversion of clean water. These BMPs were not extensively reported across the Chesapeake Bay watershed, so their total estimated effect is not as substantial in comparison to other practices (Devereux and others, 2018) . The BMPs that convert agricultural land to other land uses were estimated to reduce total nitrogen by a large amount for each acre of implementation. These BMPs include forest buffers, grass buffers, streamside forest and grass buffers, land retirement, and pasture fencing. These BMPs were estimated to reduce the total nitrogen load to streams from 20 to 56 pounds per acre of implementation. These BMPs were reported to be widespread throughout the watershed, and accounted for 42 percent of the total estimated reduction in nitrogen loads to streams due to agricultural BMPs through 2014. Other agricultural BMPs, such as conservation plans and conservation tillage, were estimated to reduce only a relatively small amount of nitrogen to streams (1 and 3 pounds per acre of implementation), but were reported in large enough amounts throughout the watershed to account for almost 22 percent of the total estimated reduction in nitrogen due to agricultural BMPs.\nBarnyard runoff control and loafing lot management were estimated to reduce total phosphorus loads by a substantial amount per acre of implementation (19 and 22 pounds per acre), however, the total effect was not estimated to be large due to limited implementation. Pasture fencing and streamside grass buffers also were estimated to be effective at reducing phosphorus loads to streams, with 12 to 13 pounds of phosphorus reduced per acre of implementation. Collectively, they accounted for about 20 percent of the total reduction in phosphorus load due to BMPs on agricultural land by 2014.\nThe agricultural BMPs with the largest estimated reduction in sediment loads to streams per acre of implementation were streamside grass buffers and pasture fencing at 9,800 and 7,700 pounds per acre, respectively. However, the largest total estimated reduction in sediment loads to streams from agricultural BMPs was attributed to conservation tillage. Conservation tillage accounted for approximately 31 percent of the total estimated reduction in phosphorus to streams by 2014.\nThe implementation of certain BMPs that affect nutrients from animal production are reported to the CBP in animal units. Mortality composting was estimated to reduce nitrogen loads to streams by 10 pounds per animal unit, and phosphorus loads by 2 pounds per animal unit. Animal waste management systems were estimated to reduce nitrogen loads to streams by 5 pounds per animal unit, and phosphorus loads by 1 pound per animal unit. Phytase feed additives were estimated to reduce phosphorus loads by 1 pound per animal unit.\nInfiltration BMPs were estimated to account for the largest reduction in nitrogen loads to streams from developed land in 2014. Dry ponds and wet ponds also were extensively reported, and accounted for a large proportion of the estimated total nitrogen reduction by 2014 ( fig. 7A ). These BMPs also were estimated to have a large effect on phosphorus and sediment loads to streams (figs. 7B and 7C). Erosion and sediment controls provided the largest total reduction to phosphorus and sediment loads by 2014, with large additional reductions estimated from the abandoned mineland reclamation BMP.\nBMPs on developed land vary widely in their effectiveness per unit of implementation (table 6). Bio-Retention was estimated to be the most effective BMP for reducing nutrients and sediment, reducing total nitrogen loads to streams by 81 pounds per acre, total phosphorus loads by 11 pounds per acre, and total sediment by 5,200 pounds per acre of implementation. This BMP was not reported to be implemented substantially across the watershed, and only accounted for about 2.5 percent of the estimated reduction of total nitrogen from BMPs on developed land (Devereux and others, 2018) . Dry ponds, wet ponds/wetlands, and infiltration BMPs have a relatively low estimated effectiveness, ranging from 2.3 pounds of nitrogen reduced per acre of implementation to 12.4 pounds per acre, but were reported to be implemented extensively throughout the watershed. They accounted for 49 percent of the reduction in nitrogen loads from developed L a n d r e t i r e m e n t A n i m a l w a s t e m a n a g e m e n t s y s t e m s A n i m a l w a s t e m a n a g e m e n t s y s t e m s P a s t u r e f e n c i n g P h y t a s e T i e r 1 n u t r i e n t m a n a g e m e n t T i e r 1 n u t r i e n t m a n a g e m e n t L a n d r e t i r e m e n t C o v e r c r o p s F o r e s t b u f f e r s T r e e p l a n t i n g T r e e p l a n t i n g P r e c i s i o n r o t a t i o n a l g r a z i n g M a n u r e t r a n s p o r t E n h a n c e d n u t r i e n t m a n a g e m e n t S t r e a m r e s t o r a t i o n B a r n y a r d r u n o f f c o n t r o l P r e c i s i o n a g r i c u l t u r e M a n u r e t r a n s p o r t E n h a n c e d n u t r i e n t m a n a g e m e n t M a n u r e t r a n s p o r t In 1985, the conservation tillage BMP accounted for nearly all of the estimated reduction in total nitrogen (95 percent), phosphorus (87 percent), and sediment (98 percent) loads due to BMPs on agricultural land in the Chesapeake Bay watershed (figs. 8A, 8B, and 8C). By the year 2000, conservation tillage accounted for 30 percent of the estimated nitrogen reduction, 9 percent of the estimated phosphorus reduction, and 68 percent of the estimated sediment reduction. By 2014, conservation tillage accounted for just 13 percent of the total estimated nitrogen reduction, 5 percent of the estimated phosphorus reduction, and 38 percent of the estimated reduction in sediment loads. After the year 1997, a wider variety of agricultural BMPs were reported in greater numbers. Land-use change type BMPs became more prevalent across the watershed. In 2014, land retirement, pasture fencing, grass and forest buffers, streamside grass and forest buffers, and tree plantings accounted for 44 percent of the estimated reduction in nitrogen load to streams, 31 percent of the estimated reduction in phosphorus load to streams, 37 percent of the estimated reduction in sediment load to streams.\nThe infiltration, dry pond, and wet pond BMPs accounted for the majority of estimated total nitrogen reductions to streams from 1985 to 2014 due to BMPs on developed land ( fig. 9A ). Prior to 2005, nearly all of the reduction in nitrogen was predicted to come from these three BMPs. The Forest Conservation Act (Department of Legislative Services, Office of Policy Analysis, 2017), which is reported in Maryland, has accounted for a growing proportion of the estimated nitrogen reduction from 2006 through 2014. Stormwater management BMPs are estimated to have had a slightly increased total effect over the study period. By 2014, they were estimated to have had a similar overall effect as wet ponds. Sharp increases in estimated phosphorus and sediment reductions after 2005 were driven by the erosion and sediment controls and abandoned mineland reclamation BMPs (figs. 9B and 9C). Some developed land BMPs fluctuated greatly from year to year. This may have been due to changing reporting standards or the nature of their implementation. Some BMPs are dependent on continual investment to remain operational, which may not always be possible.

Estimates of Best Management Practice (BMP) effectiveness were not extensively documented at the regional scale in the study area. Information on the spatial and temporal patterns of BMP implementation can provide context to current conditions as well as assist in understanding trends in water-quality loads. The CBP Partnership Phase 5.3.2 Watershed Model was used to evaluate a set of scenarios in order to investigate spatial and temporal patterns of BMP implementation in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The CBP also provided reported amounts of various types of BMP implementation on agricultural and developed land. Year to year changes in reported BMP implementation may partially reflect changing reporting standards and the revision of historical records in addition to actual changes in BMP implementation. An analysis of model results was performed in order to estimate the expected effectiveness of BMPs at mitigating nutrient and sediment loads throughout the watershed. The total expected effect of different types of BMPs on nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment were estimated as well as the expected effect per unit of BMP implementation.\nConservation plans, conservation tillage, and tier 1 nutrient management plans were identified as the BMPs with the most reported acres of implementation in the Chesapeake Bay watershed in 2014. A measure of BMP implementation intensity was defined as acres of BMP implementation per available land use. Spatial patterns of BMP implementation can be associated with different agricultural practices throughout the watershed. Areas with large amounts of animal production, such as the Potomac subregion, were found to have large amounts of related animal type BMPs, such as pasture fencing and animal waste management systems (AWMSs). In general, areas of high crop production tended to have large amounts of cover crops and conservation tillage. Additionally, each jurisdiction in the Chesapeake Bay watershed (consisting of New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, West Virginia, Virginia, and the District of Columbia) tended to focus on certain types of BMPs. Maryland had a higher intensity of reported cover crops and conservation tillage BMPs than other areas of the watershed. Pennsylvania had a lower intensity of BMPs reported on cropland in comparison to other jurisdictions. Virginia had a higher intensity of animal type BMPs.\nThe amount of agricultural BMPs reported as acres in the Chesapeake Bay watershed increased from 1985 to 2014. Developed land BMPs were only reported in small numbers in 1985, but increased substantially from 2000 to 2014. Conservation tillage constituted the majority of reported agricultural BMP implementation in 1985 and increased slightly by 2014 but decreased from 88 percent to 18 percent of the proportion of the total reported agricultural BMP implementation during the same time period as more alternative BMP types became available and were reported. After the year 2000, a larger proportion of agricultural BMPs consisted of land-use change type BMPs, including land retirement, pasture fencing, grass buffers, and forest buffers.\nBy 2014, BMPs were estimated to have reduced total nitrogen loads to streams by approximately 49 million pounds on agricultural land and 7 million pounds on developed land. Agricultural BMPs were estimated to reduce phosphorus loads to streams by 5 million pounds whereas BMPs on developed lands were expected to reduce phosphorus loads by about 1 million pounds. Reductions in sediment loads due to BMPs were estimated at 3.3 billion pounds for agricultural BMPs and 560 million pounds for developed land BMPs.\nThe largest estimated reduction in total nitrogen on agricultural lands by 2014 was attributed to land retirement, AWMSs, and conservation tillage. AWMSs were estimated to reduce total phosphorus loads to streams by the largest amount, followed by pasture fencing and phytase feed. Other agricultural BMPs had a marginal effect on phosphorus loads by comparison. Conservation tillage, conservation plans, and pasture fencing were estimated to have the greatest total effects on sediment loads to streams.\nLoafing lot management and barnyard runoff controls had the highest estimated reduction in nitrogen and phosphorus per acre of implementation, but were not widely reported across the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Land-use conversion BMPs, such as forest buffers, grass buffers, streamside forest and grass buffers, land retirement, and pasture fencing were estimated to reduce the total nitrogen load to streams from 20 to 56 pounds per acre of implementation. These BMPs accounted for 42 percent of the total estimated reduction in nitrogen loads to streams due to agricultural BMPs by 2014. Conservation plans and conservation tillage were estimated to reduce only 1 and 3 pounds per acre of implementation, respectively, but accounted for 22 percent of the total estimated reduction in nitrogen due to agricultural BMPs. Pasture fencing and streamside grass buffers were estimated to be effective at reducing phosphorus loads to streams with 12 and 13 pounds of phosphorus reduced per acre of implementation, and these BMPs accounted for about 20 percent of the total reduction in phosphorus load on agricultural land by 2014. Conservation tillage accounted for the largest total estimated reduction in sediment loads to streams.\nBio-retention was estimated to be the most effective BMP for reducing nutrients and sediment on developed land, but this BMP is not frequently used or reported in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Although dry ponds, wet ponds and constructed wetlands, and infiltration BMPs have a relatively low estimated effectiveness, they accounted for 49 percent of the total reduction in nitrogen loads to streams due to BMPs, 48 percent of the phosphorus load reduction, and 36 percent of the sediment load reduction.\nConservation tillage accounted for nearly all of the estimated reduction in total nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment loads due to BMPs on agricultural land in the Chesapeake Bay watershed in 1985. Although the total estimated reduction in nutrients and sediment from this BMP did not change significantly by 2014, conservation tillage accounted for just 13 percent of the total estimated nitrogen reduction, 5 percent of the total estimated phosphorus reduction, and 38 percent of the total estimated sediment load reduction as a wider variety of agricultural BMPs were reported. These included land-use change type BMPs, such as land retirement, pasture fencing, grass and forest buffers, streamside grass and forest buffers, and tree plantings.\nThe largest reductions in nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment to streams by 2014 were predicted on the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay and in the Potomac subregion. A large amount of reported implementation of conservation tillage, cover crops, AWMSs, and conservation plans on the Eastern Shore were responsible for large estimated reductions in nutrient and sediment loads to streams. In the Potomac subregion, extensive implementation of pasture fencing was estimated to reduce nutrient loads in addition to the implementation of a variety of other BMPs to pasture and cropland."}]
