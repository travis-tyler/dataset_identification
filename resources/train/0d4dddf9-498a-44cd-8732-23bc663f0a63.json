The current reductionist approach, simplifying biological behaviour by categorizing treatment according to metastatic sites and enumeration, has proven successful to a degree, but persistent variations in outcomes and treatment responses remain unpredictable. Metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa) patients with bone or visceral metastases are reported to have a poor prognosis compared to those with non-regional lymph node (NRLN) metastases in isolation [1] [2] [3] . Based on these results, NRLN metastases in isolation can be considered a low-risk feature in patients with mPCa; however, a non-negligible proportion of patients present with concomitant NRLN and bone metastases [4] [5] [6] . Such patients were reported to have poor overall survival (OS) compared with patients with only bone metastases in the STAMPEDE and TAX 327 trials, indicating this as a high-risk feature [4, 6, 7] . This has led to uncertainty regarding inclusion or exclusion of NRLN metastases in prominent enumeration-based oligometastatic definitions [8] [9] [10] . A recent review reported that only two out of six studies and four out of 10 ongoing trials explicitly include NRLN metastases as an enumeration criterion [10] . Moreover, 'high-volume' disease definitions, as used in the CHAARTED, GETUG-15 and LATITUDE trials, do not consider NRLN metastases [11] [12] [13] .\nThe aforementioned trial results demonstrating adverse prognosis of patients with concomitant bone and NRLN metastases may be inferred but not directly extrapolated to a general population-based setting, as trials select patients who are generally younger and fitter overall. Thus, it is appropriate to explore the prognostic relevance of concomitant NRLN metastases in patients with bone metastases in a large nationwide population to evaluate their inclusion or exclusion for guiding treatment decisions based on oligometastatic definitions [11, 12, 14, 15] ."}, {"section_title": "Data Source", "text": "The US National Cancer Institute-Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database documents cancer incidence and mortality data from 18 cancer registries covering~28% of the US population.

Additionally, we excluded five patients with missing information on census tract income and education. After all exclusions, the final study cohort comprised 17 167 men."}, {"section_title": "Sites of Metastases", "text": "The collaborative staging data collection system is a joint initiative sponsored by the AJCC to streamline staging data collection in cancer registries [17, 18] . The 'CS mets at dx (2004+)' variable in the SEER database includes information on metastatic sites at diagnosis. We used this variable to subclassify patients by metastatic site at diagnosis into four groups as follows: only NRLN metastases (codes: 11, 12, 20) ; only bone metastases (code: 30); bone + NRLN metastases (code: 35); and other sites AE bone/NRLN metastases (codes: 40, 50, 58, 55)."}, {"section_title": "Covariates and Study Endpoints", "text": "We abstracted age at diagnosis, race, year of diagnosis, PSA level at diagnosis, Gleason score at diagnosis, T stage (derived AJCC T stage, 6th edition) and N stage (derived AJCC N stage, 6th edition), marital status and SEER registry for each patient. Race was classified as white, African-American, and other/ unknown. PSA was used as a categorical variable (<20, 20-49.9, 50-97.9, \u226598 ng/mL, or unknown), as the SEER database categorizes all PSA values \u226598 ng/mL into one category. Gleason score was determined from SEER collaborative staging site-specific factors 5-10 [19] . The highest available Gleason score was abstracted for each patient and categorized as \u22647, 8, 9, 10 or unknown. Additionally, as the SEER database began recording insurance status from 2007 onwards, we abstracted insurance status (insured, Medicaid, non-insured or unknown) for use in a supplementary analysis limited to patients diagnosed between 2007 and 2013.\nFurthermore, as the SEER database does not provide individual patient-level socio-economic status (SES) we also obtained county-level SES indicators. We used county-level income (median household income) and education status (percentage of residents aged \u226525 years with at least a high school education) as proxies for SES by linking to the 2000 USA census, and included them as continuous variables [20] . The residential status of patients was also determined at the county level by linking to 2013 US Department of Agriculture rural-urban continuum codes, with patients living in a county of <20 000 residents classed as non-metropolitan and the remaining as living in a metropolitan area [21] .\nThe primary study endpoint was all-cause mortality (ACM), defined as the time from diagnosis until death from any cause, with patients alive at the end of the study period censored (31 December 2014).

The first set of analyses compared the survival within the whole cohort. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and comparisons were performed using the log-rank test and unadjusted Cox models. Cox regression analysis was used to assess the risk of ACM, and PCSM was assessed using Fine and Gray competing risk regression with non-PCSM treated as a competing risk [22] . All multivariable models were adjusted for age, race, PSA, Gleason score, year of diagnosis, T stage, N stage, SEER registry, residence, income, education status and marital status. We then performed a sensitivity analysis to gauge the effect of a potential unmeasured confounder on the obtained hazard ratio (HR) of ACM for patients with bone + NRLN metastases from the multivariate Cox regression analysis [23, 24] . Additionally, to account for more favourable baseline prognosis of patients with only bone metastases, we conducted landmark analyses limited to patients surviving a minimum of \u22656 and \u226512 months from diagnosis. Furthermore, we also conducted two sets of supplementary multivariate analyses. As a large proportion of patients had unknown Gleason scores or PSA levels, we excluded these patients to rule out any missing data bias and repeated multivariate Cox and competing risk regression analyses as stated above. We also repeated multivariate Cox and competing risk regressions analyses by introducing insurance status as an additional covariate along with the other aforementioned covariates in a subset of patients diagnosed between 2007 and 2013.\nWe then explored the risk of ACM associated with bone + NRLN metastases using univariate Cox regression analyses in three pre-specified subgroups. First, we explored whether the magnitude of risk of ACM associated with bone + NRLN metastases differed significantly among patients with or without regional lymph node disease. Second, we stratified the cohort by year of diagnosis (2004-2009 vs 2010-2013 ).\nThis was done to exclude any possible heterogeneity attributable to a substantial change in the therapeutic landscape for castration-resistant mPCa (mCRPC) following 2010 with the introduction of newer life-prolonging drugs [25] . Third, to explore heterogeneity attributable to variances in data abstraction among different SEER registries, we grouped the SEER registries according to different Contract Health Service Delivery Area regions (Pacific Coast, South West, Northern Plains and Eastern; Table S1 ) and then evaluated the risk associated with ACM for patients with bone + NRLN metastases among these different regions.\nIn the second set of analyses, we first performed a 1:1 propensity-score matching to account for inherent differences observed in baseline characteristics [26] . Patients with bone + NRLN metastases were matched to patients with only bone metastases using the nearest-neighbour method without replacement on the logit of the propensity score (derived from age, race, year of diagnosis, Gleason score, PSA, T stage, N stage, SEER registry, marital status, residence, household income, education level). The caliper width used was 0.1 times the standard deviation of the propensity score logit [27] . After matching, the balance of covariates between the matched groups was checked [28] . We then repeated multivariate Cox and competing risk regression analyses for predicting ACM and PCSM, respectively.\nStatistical analyses were carried out using R statistical package v.3.3.3 (R Project for Statistical Computing, http://www.rproject.org/) or STATA 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).

Patients with bone + NRLN metastases were significantly younger (median age 66 vs 71 years), had higher Gleason score (Gleason score 8-10 disease: 83.5% vs 74.5%), had a higher PSA level (\u226598 ng/mL: 68.4% vs 51.5%), presented with a higher T stage (T stage 3-4: 38% vs 25.1%) and had greater involvement of regional lymph nodes (N1: 73% vs 17.5%) compared to patients with only bone metastases (all P values <0.05; Tables 1 and S2 )."}, {"section_title": "Survival Analyses in Overall Cohort", "text": "The mean and median follow-up times for the entire cohort were 65 (95% CI 64.4-66.2) and 63 months (95% CI 61.6-64.4), respectively.

Overall, the unmeasured confounder sensitivity analyses indicated that a marked difference in the prevalence of an unmeasured confounder associated with a modest risk of death (HR 1.25), or a modest imbalance in the prevalence of a potential unmeasured confounder associated with a high risk of death (HR 3.25), would be required to render our results insignificant (Table 3) ."}, {"section_title": "Subgroup Analyses", "text": "Finally, subgroup analyses did not show any heterogeneity in increased risk of ACM associated with bone + NRLN metastases among patients with N1 (HR 1.322, 95% CI 1.193-1.464; P < 0.001) or N0 disease (HR 1.367, 95% CI 1.201-1.556; P < 0.001; interaction P value = 0.638 [ Fig. S2]) .

This is exemplified by the increased risk of ACM and PCSM in patients presenting with coexisting NRLN and bone metastases as compared to patients with only bone metastases.\nThese findings have important implications for guiding oligometastatic definitions and decisions regarding the use of life-prolonging therapies, such as docetaxel or abiraterone acetate, in hormone-na\u20ac \u0131ve mPCa. Currently, there is an ongoing international debate regarding the definition and use of 'high-' and 'low-volume' radiological disease burden in directing combination systemic treatment [11] [12] [13] 29] . Highvolume disease at diagnosis currently indicates docetaxel treatment within the hormone-na\u20ac \u0131ve mPCa population in some countries [15] , based on the findings of the CHAARTED and GETUG-15 studies [11, 13] ; however, this view is not accepted universally following published data from the docetaxel containing arms of the STAMPEDE trial [14, [29] [30] [31] [32] , where there was no observed heterogeneity of effect. This clinical uncertainty is reflected in the recent Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference report in which 36% of PCa experts did not agree with the ACM, all-cause mortality; HR, hazard ratio; NRLN, non-regional lymph node; PCSM, prostate cancer-specific mortality; SEER, Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results. *All HRs or subdistribution HRs displayed are for patients with bone + NRLN metastases (patients with only bone metastases is the reference category).\n'CHAARTED' definition and 14% felt that they would administer docetaxel and androgen deprivation therapy to patients with any metastatic disease when first presenting, whether 'low' or 'high' volume [8] . Even if the high/low hypothesis is supported by further data from ongoing studies, there is a fundamental flaw in this 'CHAARTED'-based approach to patients who present with metastases both in NRLNs and bone, but whose bone metastases number falls below the defined number of 4 (or 3 in the LATITUDE trial) [11, 12] . This is because the NRLN status in the context of bone metastases is not currently acknowledged in highvolume 'CHAARTED-type' definitions; therefore, volumetric definitions as used in some other ongoing clinical trials which include NRLN in their enumeration criteria might be more appropriate to guide risk stratification in mPCa [10] . More recently, a panel of advanced PCa imaging experts also recommended (85% consensus) that enumeration-based oligometastatic definitions should be pooled over NRLN and bone metastases [9] . Our results support this recommendation.\nFindings similar to those of the present study have also been previously reported within the STAMPEDE and TAX327 trials [4, 6] . Evaluation of data from 917 patients enrolled within the control arm of the STAMPEDE trial showed that patients with bone + soft tissue metastases (mainly NRLN) have a worse 2-year OS (75% vs 60%) compared to patients with only bone metastases. Our findings are similar to these, and add a greater reassurance that these outcomes also apply to a 'real-world' non-trial population. The larger scale of the investigation also provides a high degree of confidence that the effect reported herein is a true phenomenon. Similarly, Pond et al. [6] compared OS in patients with mCRPC with bone + NRLN metastases to patients with only bone metastases within the TAX327 trial. They also reported an increased risk of death in patients with bone + NRLN metastases compared to patients with only bone metastases (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.17-1.6) for the overall cohort after adjusting for treatment received, baseline pain, Karnofsky performance score, prior progression type, PSA, tumour grade, alkaline phosphatase level and haemoglobin level. Furthermore, a recent SEER Medicare analysis of 4 404 patients with mPCa was conducted to evaluate the relationship of metastatic sites to skeletal-related events [33] . This study reported that patients with bone + NRLN metastases have a higher probability of developing skeletalrelated events compared with patients with only bone metastases (52% vs 46%). Taken together these findings suggest that bone + NRLN metastases is an aggressive mPCa phenotype at presentation and continues to be so in the mCRPC setting.\nThe present findings also provide an interesting insight into the natural history of PCa.\nWe have yet to explain from a biomolecular perspective why the combined interaction associated with NRLN and bone metastases shows a significant reduction in OS when compared with bone metastases alone; however, in the present cohort, patients with bone + NRLN metastases were younger than those with only bone metastases. Furthermore, no heterogeneity in effect was seen between patients with N0 or N1 disease, and N1 disease status was not a significant predictor in our multivariate models; therefore, this disease phenotype at presentation may represent an aggressive mPCa phenotype wherein distant haematogenous and lymphatic spread occur simultaneously or in quick succession. Further evaluation of metastatic dissemination patterns in the hormone-na\u20ac \u0131ve setting are warranted to evaluate linear progression or metastasis to metastasis spread as reported in mCRPC [34, 35] .\nThe results of the present study should be interpreted within the context of the limitations pertaining to data obtained from SEER [36] . The identification of metastatic sites is based on the best available information (clinical/imaging/ pathological) in the SEER registries; therefore, a great share of this information in living patients can be considered to be obtained from conventional imaging and a detection bias attributable to lower sensitivity cannot be excluded. Current oligometastatic definitions as used in the CHAARTED, GETUG-15 and LATITUDE studies are based on conventional imaging ( 99m Tc-methylene diphosphonate planar or single-photon-emission CT bone scan and cross-sectional CT/MRI of the pelvis and abdomen AE chest). These conventional imaging techniques have a lower sensitivity in detecting metastases compared with emerging imaging techniques, such as Na 18 F-PET, 68 Ga-PSMA-11 positronemission tomography and whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI. With increasing adoption of emerging imaging techniques, a stage migration (very-high-risk M0 to oligometastatic M1) can be foreseen. Further evaluation of metastatic site and enumeration-based definitions using emerging techniques is therefore warranted in future clinical trials. Other variables regarding metastatic burden such as number, size and location, which are being used to further refine risk stratification in the metastatic setting are not recorded in the SEER database; however, our sensitivity analyses suggested that a moderate imbalance in metastatic site prevalence would not affect our conclusions. We also recognize that a number of other additional prognostic variables, such as performance status and alkaline phosphatase level, are not recorded in the SEER database and could not be included in the analyses, limiting our ability to draw conclusions. Finally, data on systemic therapies were unavailable; however, androgen deprivation therapy remained the 'gold standard' for patients with de novo mPCa for the study duration. Furthermore, a subgroup analysis before and after 2010 did not reveal any heterogeneity, ruling out a potential bias favouring improved survival of patients with only bone metastases after 2010 in the mCRPC setting.\nIn conclusion, the combination of NRLN with bone metastases is a poor prognostic marker in comparison with bone metastases alone. This should be considered as a highrisk feature within metastatic volume-stratified definitions to improve the accuracy of disease volume-based decisions when considering combination treatments in hormone-na\u20ac \u0131ve mPCa. The mechanisms explaining this differential biological effect are poorly understood and further investigations are required to improve the basic scientific understanding of hormonena\u20ac \u0131ve metastatic phenotypes. Prospective volumetric disease quantification, with a precise recording of metastatic sites and burden, should be considered as part of future trial designs within hormone-na\u20ac \u0131ve mPCa treatment."}, {"section_title": "Supporting Information", "text": "Additional Supporting Information may be found online in the Supporting Information section at the end of the article: Hazard ratios for all-cause mortality for patients with bone + NRLN metastases compared to patients with only bone metastases within different subgroups.
