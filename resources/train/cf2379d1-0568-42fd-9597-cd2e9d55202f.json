We added the detailed characteristics of our protocol in the revised manuscript.\nThe abstract does not provide any detail on the \"rich\" data to be collected, nor what the study adds to the cognitive health data that will be available already in LASI. The strengths and limitations section is more informative, though the only limitation given is that only 14 of the 36 Indian states and Union Territories will be covered, raising a question about whether the study with truly provide populationrepresentative data, as stated.\nWe provide details explaining the additional cognition data that LASI-DAD collects in comparison to the main LASI. The selected 14 states represent 72% of the population, and to obtain population representativeness, we post-stratify our sample based on the Census data.\nIn general, the information provided is imprecise or important detail is missing -for example, how the sample will be \"randomly\" drawn from those with high and low risk, how respondents will be recruited and what happens if a potential respondent does not consent, what training the field team administering HCAP receives, how a representative sample for the 200 imaging and 960 genotyping studies will be chosen, dates of data-collection, plans for data management and oversight, etc.\nDiagnosis will be based on Clinical Dementia Rating but this is based on a standardised interview and no mention is made that this is happening?\nWe provide the details aforementioned by reviewer 1."}, {"section_title": "Reviewer: 2", "text": "Reviewer Name: Walter Kukull Institution and Country: University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA Please state any competing interests or state 'None declared': none Thank you for the opportunity to review this well written protocol.
