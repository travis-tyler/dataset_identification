Prospective evidence suggests that depression confers risk for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) with an overall relative risk of 1.64. [1, 2] A diagnosis of depression at index evaluation is associated with an increased odds ratio (OR) for adverse outcome: for myocardial infarction (MI), an OR of 4.5, and for stroke, an OR of 2.7. [3] Depression is also a risk factor for the development of heart failure (HF) and for adverse outcomes in patients with existing HF. [4, 5] Major depressive disorder (MDD) prevalence can reach 33-45% in patients following MI. Although prevalence of MDD among New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I HF patients was as low as 8%, among class IV patients it reached 40%. [6] Reduced exercise capacity among HF patients has a negative impact on their psychological condition and can theoretically promote depressive symptoms. However, this explanation oversimplifies a complex situation. Studies show that the close relation between MDD and HF is caused by the common neuro-endocrine background of the two diseases. HF patients with MDD are at increased cardiovascular mortality risk compared to non-depressed patients. [6] A silent cerebral infarction (SCI) is classified as a type III cerebrovascular disorder by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. [7] SCI was identified as a risk factor for clinical stroke. [8] In HF patients, prevalence of SCI varies between 27% and 78 %. [9, 10] It may be related to depression. [11] Patients with ischemic and non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) have a high incidence of clinically asymptomatic SCI.

Carotid artery pathology rates were very high in SCI patients. These patients also had higher rates of MDD compared to non-SCI patients. Patients with MDD had a higher NYHA class, increased rates of SCI and carotid artery pathology, a larger left atrium, lower free-T3 levels, increased anginal symptoms and higher rates of PND in the study.\nIn the general population, prevalence of SCI varies between 10% and 28%, whereas in patients with stroke it is as high as 38%. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] The prevalence of SCI has been reported as up to 78% in HF patients. [20] Our completed questionnaires to assess depression (BDI). Objective markers of HF severity included EF, B-type natriuretic peptide, and peak oxygen consumption. Measures more likely to be affected by perceived functional status included NYHA classification and the 6-minute walk test. Objective assessments of disease severity were slightly related (peak oxygen consumption) or not related (B-type natriuretic peptide and EF) to BDI scores. Using multivariate analysis only age, gender, cardiopulmonary exercise testing duration, NYHA class, 6-minute walk distance, and peak respiratory exchange ratio independently correlated with BDI scores. Authors concluded that depression was minimally related to objective assessments of severity of disease in patients with HF, but was associated with patient (and clinician) perceptions of disease severity. [31] Although there was no association between some parameters such as EF, B-type natriuretic peptide level, hs-CRP level and fibrinogen level and MDD, there was a relation between larger left atrium and lower free-T3 level, and MDD in the patient group in our study. Patients with MDD had a higher NYHA class, a larger left atrium and lower free-T3 levels. We found a positive correlation between subjective parameters such as NYHA, PND and angina. Larger chamber dimensions and lower free-T3 were markers of advanced disease and poor prognosis in chronic HF. [33, 34] Premachandra et al. reported that patients with major depression had 6.4% low T3 syndrome. Since these patients had normal metabolic parameters, the low T3 levels could not have depended on malnutrition or any other illness. Depression might constitute an illness having the same relation to low T3 as found in the low T3 syndrome previously described in euthyroid sick subjects. [35] Although Brott et al. found that degree of carotid artery stenosis was not associated with SCI in a group of patients with high-grade asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis, [36] in the present study 70% of patients with SCI had carotid artery stenosis or calcified plaque in carotid duplex ultrasonography. There was no association between depressive symptoms and carotid intima media thickness in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, which included healthy communitydwelling volunteers. [37] We found a clear association between carotid artery stenosis or calcified plaque and MDD in our study group. We speculated that results for our patients may have been different because they were more morbid, with very advanced disease compatients had 70% SCI, which was among the highest rate in other studies. Patients with SCI are at increased risk of stroke. [8] It is known that disabling stroke is the fourth leading cause of disease burden and the second leading cause of death among adults worldwide. [21] Stroke history has been a predictor for worse prognosis in chronic HF patients. [22] Depression has a significant prevalence in patients following a stroke. Studies have found rates to be between 25-54%. [23] Most studies have examined the prevalence rates of depression and the clinical correlates of depression. The overall prevalence of major depression has been reported as 21.7%, and minor depression 19.5%. The strongest single correlate of depression is severity of impairment in activities of daily living. Depression following acute stroke has also been associated with greater cognitive impairment and increased mortality. [24] Terroni et al. reported that 31% of stroke patients had experienced a major depressive episode following stroke. [25] It is known that prevalence of major depression can vary between 8-40% in HF patients. 6 In this population, depression has been independently associated with a poor quality of life, limited functional status, and an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] In the present study, prevalence of MDD was 52% in the patient group. While 60% of patients with SCI had MDD, 29% of patients without SCI had MDD. 60% prevalence of MDD in SCI patients is significantly higher than in depressive patients with stroke. Our high MDD ratio could result from our patient group comprising chronic HF patients with increased SCI rates. We speculated that both HF and SCI could be associated with increased depressive symptom rates. When two co-morbid conditions coexist, MDD rates may be expected to be higher than in patients with either chronic HF or SCI.\nIn previous studies, patients of a higher NYHA class had increased depression compared to those of a lower NYHA class. [6] Significant correlations predicting MDD included disability due to the illness and more severe illness (NYHA class). [32] The Heart Failure And a Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of Exercise Training (HF-ACTION) evaluated the relation between objective and subjective parameters and made comparisons with scores on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) in HF. At baseline, the 2331 subjects enrolled in HF-ACTION pared to those in the above-mentioned studies.\nWe may conclude that MDD is associated with both objective symptoms of HF such as higher larger left atrium diameter and decreased free-T3 level, and subjective symptoms of HF such as NYHA and PND. It was shown in this patient group that depressive symptoms in HF patients are closely associated with SCI and carotid artery pathology.\nPatients with SCI had a higher prevalence of MDD compared to patients without SCI in this study. We showed that prevalence of MDD in SCI patients may be higher than in patients with stroke, as reported in previous studies (60% vs 25-54%). [23] We may speculate that depression could be attributed to perception among stroke patients. While patients with stroke may have many difficulties and restrictions in their daily life activities, [38, 39] patients with HF might have restrictions in daily life [40] due to fatigue and shortness of breath. Daily life difficulties may be one reason for depression in patients with stroke and HF. It is known that in SCI, the accumulation of infarct lesions induces obstruction in the neuron network related to mood and once this exceeds a certain threshold, the patient becomes predisposed to vascular depression. [41] When both silent infarcts and overt infarcts cause enough obstruction in the neuron network related to mood, depressive symptoms may be seen in stroke and SCI in chronic HF patients."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "Patient and control group size was the most important limitation of this study. Our numbers were not high because some candidate patients and healthy controls did not agree to participate in the study because of MRI-related claustrophobia or because evaluation of depression would take up too much of their time in daily routine."}]
