Compelling evidence indicates that pre-existing immunological features contribute to the ability of patients with solid tumours to respond to immunotherapy with immunomodulatory agents such as checkpoint inhibitors [2] . The Immune Biomarkers Task\nForce of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) recently published recommendations on the discovery of immune-related biomarkers, in which it highlighted the complexity of the tumour microenvironment (TME) and discussed novel tools to analyse the diversity of immune genes, proteins, cells and pathways [3] . A broader understanding of baseline immunity, both in the periphery and in the TME, and of immune escape mechanisms is likely to expedite the identification of biomarkers that are predictive of clinical outcome and elucidate why cancer patients might fail to respond to immunotherapy [4, 5] . Powerful Genome Atlas (TCGA) in 11 solid tumour types encompassing breast, lung, melanoma and lung adenocarcinoma and representing 3,485 patients [6] . In contrast, macrophage signatures predicted poorer survival in most tumour types. The presence of T-cell infiltration contributes to a higher \"immunoscore\" in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), which correlates with improved patient prognosis [7] .\nWhereas the role of anti-tumour immunity in shaping clinical responses to therapy has been thoroughly investigated in melanoma and CRC, our understanding of the role played by individual immune cell types in the control of haematological malignancies remains limited. In principle, haematological malignancies are amenable to immune-mediated therapeutic effects, as suggested by the curative potential of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Although immune checkpoint blockade has only been pursued recently in patients with Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma [8, 9] , the field is expected to advance exponentially, as has already occurred in solid tumour oncology. This will entail a paradigm shift in our current treatment modalities. An imperative for the correct design of clinical trials would be to dissect the determinants of response and resistance to checkpoint blockade and to decipher the architecture and composition of the TME, as well as the functional orientation of peripheral blood immune cells in patients with leukaemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma (MM). Challenges to identifying biomarkers have recently been reviewed [10] . Despite the reciprocal relationship between tumours and the patient's immune system, it is presently unknown whether measurements in blood may correlate with findings from tumour sites, including lymph nodes and bone marrow (BM) [3, 11] . In this respect, peripheral blood markers reflecting immune function at baseline (\"peripheral immunoscore\") have successfully predicted progression-free survival (PFS) in patients receiving vaccines for metastatic breast cancer and prostate cancer [12] .\nThis review will focus on current strategies to interrogate the immunological TME in patients with haematological malignancies, with the objective to subvert cancer-induced immune suppression and identify targets for treatment."}, {"section_title": "Structure and function of the tumour microenvironment (TME)", "text": "Neoplastic cells activate gene expression programmes in the TME that are supportive of tumour growth and inherently immune suppressive [4] . The TME is increasingly viewed as an attractive candidate for the discovery of predictive and prognostic immune biomarkers [11, 13] .\nFor instance, intra-tumoural levels of IL-15 strongly correlate with immune cell proliferation and disease recurrence in patients with CRC [14] . An 'immunome' compendium of mRNA transcripts specific for innate and adaptive immune cell populations has characterised the immune composition of the TME in CRC [15] . Programmed Death Ligand (PDL)-L1 is expressed by cells in the TME, engages PD1 on T cells and triggers inhibitory signalling which prevents T-cell effector function and cytotoxicity [16] . PD-L1 expression in response to cytokine stimuli, most importantly IFN-\uf067, has been termed 'adaptive immune resistance' [17] . Co-localisation of inflammatory responses with CD8\nand PD-L1 expression has been correlated with improved clinical outcome in patients with metastatic, but not localised, melanoma, implying that 'inflamed' tumours expressing PD-L1 and the up-regulation of PD-L1 and other negative checkpoint molecules, such as Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-associated Antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and Lymphocyte Activation Gene 3 (LAG-3). an IL-27/STAT-3 axis might be a target for immunotherapy in patients with NHL."}, {"section_title": "PD", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Immune gene signatures", "text": "Innate and adaptive immune responses within the TME can be assessed by gene expression The genomic landscape of tumours has been linked with tumour immunity, with neo-antigens that are predicted by tumour genome meta-analyses being implicated in driving T-cell responses and somatic mutations associated with immunological infiltrates being identified [36, 37] . A recent analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data sets has allowed the identification of correlates of immune cytolytic activity in thousands of TCGA solid tumours [37] . On the basis of transcript levels of two tightly co-expressed cytolytic effector molecules, granzyme A and perforin, differences in cytolytic activities across tumour types were identified, with the highest levels being detected in kidney clear cell carcinoma and cervical cancers.\nInterestingly, cytolytic activities and expression of IFN-stimulated chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11) were associated with the counter-regulatory increase of immune suppressive molecules, including IDO1, IDO2, PDL2 and the C1Q complex, and with a modest, but significant, pan-cancer survival benefit [37] .\nFinally, immune gene co-expression patterns have been used to identify a subset of highconfidence marker genes in 9,986 solid tumour samples from TCGA [38] .

This section of the article provides examples of individual immune suppressive molecules that could be targeted to improve treatment outcome in patients with leukaemia, lymphoma and MM. We will highlight how on-line tools could expand our predictive capabilities [39] and support the identification of TME immune gene signatures and key molecular drivers implicated in the progression of haematological malignancies, and allow the in-silico validation of experimental findings across multiple data sets ( Table 1 and Figure 1 ) [40] [41] [42] .\nA pan-cancer resource (PREdiction of Clinical Outcomes from Genomic profiles, PRECOG;\nhttp://precog.stanford.edu) has recently been developed to identify commonalities in prognostic genes from approximately 18,000 human tumours from 166 publicly available cancer data sets with survival outcomes across 39 cancer types, including different types of haematological malignancies [43] . The statistical associations between genes and clinical outcomes were assessed by z-scores, which are directly related to p values and represent the number of standard deviations from the mean of a normal distribution. Survival-associated zscores for individual studies were combined to yield meta-z-scores for the prognostic significance of each gene in each cancer type. One of the two clusters identified was associated with inferior clinical outcomes and was functionally linked to cell proliferation [43] .\nHowever, proliferation genes were not adversely prognostic in AML. The other large tumour cluster was associated with favourable survival and was enriched in immunological processes and immune-response genes. A new machine-learning tool, known as CIBERSORT [41] , was subsequently applied to PRECOG data to comprehensively map compositional differences in tumour-infiltrating leukocytes in relation to patient outcome. Expression profiles for 22 distinct leukocyte subsets were used as input.\nCIBERSORT revealed remarkable differences in relative leukocyte composition between haematopoietic and solid tumours. As shown in and with decreased PFS and OS [53, 54] . Among the 27 individual genes with a discriminative power for outcome prediction exceeding that of the best clinical variable (patient age), matrix metallopeptidase-1 (MMP1) was over-expressed in patients with treatment failure."}, {"section_title": "Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).", "text": "NHLs are typically associated with chronic inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, with severe immune dysregulation being an established risk factor and a hallmark of the disease. For instance, high pre-treatment plasma levels of CXCL13, IL-6 and IL-10 predict worse PFS and OS in patients with AIDS-related NHL (AIDS-NHL) receiving intensive multi-agent chemotherapy and immunotherapy with rituximab [55] .\nLongitudinal monitoring of cytokine levels 1 to 5 years preceding NHL diagnosis has identified cytokines and other molecules associated with chronic immune activation, such as IL-6, IL-10\nand TNF-\uf061, as predictors of the development of systemic AIDS-NHL [56, 57] . Similarly, circulating levels of B-cell attracting chemokine 1 (BCA-1), soluble TNF receptor 2 and soluble vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 2 have been correlated with the risk of NHL in advance of diagnosis [58] . Similarly, genetic variants of toll-like receptor (TLR)-9 which lead to increased transcriptional activity in mononuclear cells might increase NHL susceptibility [59] . Finally, three independent population-based case-control studies have revealed a correlation between NHL risk and single-nucleotide polymorphisms within 12 innate immunity genes, including IL-1 receptor antagonist and IgG Fc receptor 2A [60] . Other immune cell types, such as tumour-associated mast cells and tumour-associated macrophages, have prognostic importance in FL. Mast cell infiltration was detected using immunohistochemistry and was shown to negatively affect progression-free survival in patients with FL receiving a combination of immunotherapy (rituximab) and chemotherapy (CHOP) [62] . The prognostic impact of mast cell infiltration was again independent of the FL IPI. The mechanisms by which mast cells reduce the efficacy of antibody-based therapies in FL remain to be determined and might include the negative regulation of macrophage activity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity through the expression of Fc\uf067 receptors which can engage rituximab [62] ."}, {"section_title": "Follicular lymphoma (FL)", "text": "."}, {"section_title": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)", "text": ". DLBCL is the most common subtype of NHL, representing more than 30% of all adult NHL cases diagnosed in Western countries, and is characterised by an aggressive clinical course. In spite of improved response and survival rates after the addition of rituximab to the therapeutic armamentarium, up to 40% of patients with DLBCL experience relapse and have a poor prognosis.\nGene expression profiling and next-generation sequencing have been instrumental to the identification of molecular subtypes of DLBCL, which are not obviously related to histological subtypes of DLBCL and are associated with a remarkable divergence in clinical behaviour.\nPatients with activated B-cell-like (ABC) gene signatures have a shorter survival compared with patients with the other two molecular subtypes, i.e., germinal centre B-cell (GCB) and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma signatures [63] . Non-GCB type DLBCLs are enriched with PD-L1-expressing tumours and might benefit from targeted immunotherapies [64] .\nDLBCLs have a heterogeneous immune infiltrate, which includes macrophages, DCs, NK cells, T-cell subsets and B cells. Interestingly, pre-treatment gene expression of CD68 as well as immunohistochemically-defined CD68 + macrophages might correlate with better outcome in patients with DLBCL receiving chemo-immunotherapy, independently of IPI scores or molecular subgroups [65] . In contrast, macrophage infiltration was negatively correlated with OS in patients treated without rituximab, leading to the hypothesis that rituximab administration might switch macrophage profile towards a tumour-promoting phenotype.\nTissue microarray immunohistochemistry with automated scoring of FoxP3, CD68 and microvessel (CD34) density (MVD) has been shown to stratify patients with DLBCL into risk groups and to predict prognosis [66] . Patients in the high-risk group had significantly worse EFS and PFS, suggesting that TME components should be considered as an important tool to predict patient survival. The NanoString digital hybridization approach for RNA quantification has been employed to detect immune effector and checkpoint genes in FFPE biopsies from patients with DLBCL [67] . The product of the immune effectors (CD4\u00d7CD8) in a ratio with the product of checkpoints (PD-L1\u00d7M2 macrophages) was used to identify low-immune and highimmune groupings of patients with significant differences in 4-year survival. Patients with a GCB or an ABC molecular subtype of DLBCL and a high immune ratio had a significantly extended survival compared with GCB and ABC patients with a low immune ratio, suggesting that the balance of anti-tumoural immunity, i.e., the ratio of immune effector cells to negative checkpoint molecules, might have an important prognostic value in DLBCL."}, {"section_title": "Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMLBCL).

Genomic lesions in CIITA resulted in decreased protein expression and reduction of MHC class II surface expression, favouring the establishment of an immune-privileged microenvironment in PMLBCL.\nPMLBCL has a unique transcriptomic signature which is close to classical HL and is characterised by constitutive expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2. Amplification and/or translocations involving chromosome 9p24.1, a region that includes PDCD1LG2-encoding PD-L2, are a common event in PMLBCL but not in DLBCL [70] .

Durable clinical responses up to 24 months were induced by CD19-directed CAR T cells in 90% of children and adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) [82] . Remissions caused by CD19-specific CAR T cells were correlated with high serum levels of IL-15 in patients with lymphoma [83] . CD30-specific CAR T cells have been safely and successfully administered to patients with HL [84] . Clinical responses to CAR T cells could be improved by targeting tumour-induced immune suppression with pembrolizumab [85] or by antagonising IDO1 activity with lymphodepleting drugs such as fludarabine and cyclophosphamide [86] .\nInnovative approaches are currently being developed to target T-cell malignancies with CD7-specific CAR T cells [87] and to eradicate antigen-loss relapses of myeloid malignancies with dual CD19-CD123-redirected CAR T cells [88] . Anti-myeloma activity of CAR T cells specific Bi-specific antibody construct are also being implemented in patients with advanced acute leukaemia and with NHLs. Treatment with blinatumomab, a CD3-CD19 bi-specific T-cell engager antibody, has resulted in significantly longer median OS than chemotherapy (7.7 months versus 4.0 months) in a randomised clinical trial in adults with relapsed or refractory ALL [92] . Blinatumomab induces the expansion of both na\u00efve and memory CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in patients and might skew T-cell receptor repertoires [93] . Immune biomarkers which predict clinical responses to blinatumomab have not been identified yet. Interestingly, PD-L1 expression levels may be higher in children with ALL refractory to blinatumomab [94] .\nEvidence from clinical trials in patients with solid tumours suggests that combination strategies that synergise with immune checkpoint blockade might be more effective than single-agent immunotherapy, as reviewed elsewhere [95] .

Multiple fluorophores can be applied on a single tissue section and are interrogated using a multi-spectral microscope [11, 96] . However, the extensive data that are generated with the use of the above technologies will need to be integrated and 'converted' into useful information using novel bioinformatics approaches."}, {"section_title": "Machine learning", "text": "Advances in bioinformatics have led to a vast amount of data being generated at an accelerated pace. Next generation RNA and DNA sequencing methods is providing access to incredibly detailed information on entire genomes and allowing us to interrogate more potential biomarkers with an increased level of accuracy. This massive volume of data creates a problem of complexity which makes it impossible to use traditional methodologies.\nMachine learning is an interdisciplinary field of bioinformatics which employs a data-driven class of algorithms to find solutions to a given problem by studying, for example, gene expression patterns across many cases / patients. Although widely and successfully used in biology and biomarker discovery studies, the use of these approaches in haematological malignancy studies has, to date, been extremely limited.\nMany approaches have been developed, each of which will be explained in terms of their utility here. These approaches can be broadly characterised in two distinct groups; supervised and unsupervised machine learning."}, {"section_title": "Supervised learning.", "text": "Supervised learning approaches are widely applied and use source features to predict a target class [99] . The supervised approach allows the algorithm to train itself by detecting patterns in large datasets that are predictive of the target class, for example, how does IFNG behave in acute myeloid leukaemia compared to acute lymphoblastic leukaemia? We can make use of previous studies and adjust the algorithm parameters so that it accounts for this information.\nOne major advantage is that such approaches are tolerant of the highly complex, non-linear and noisy data that are often found in biological systems.\nArtificial Neural Networks. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are statistical models emulating the function of a network of human neurones for the purposes of encapsulating information in order to analyse large, complex datasets. The learning process is based on the mathematical interconnections between the processing elements that constitute the network architecture [100] . This allows them to classify cases based on data by assigning a numerical weight value to each input and adjusting them as they sample the data, effectively learning the optimal solution. The main advantages of ANNs include their high fault and failure tolerance, scalability and consistent generalisation ability, all of which allow them to effectively predict or classify new, fuzzy and unlearned data [100, 101] . Additionally, they have been recently used to create panels of biomarkers that, when used in conjunction with each other, predict breast cancer [102] .\nThe original ANN architecture, as proposed by Rosenblatt in 1958, was based on the concept of a single artificial processing neuron with an activation threshold, adjustable weights and bias. However, this could only be used for the classification of linearly separable patterns, as it only learns when an error occurs during testing. This is rarely the case with complex problems such as cancer, as patients do not typically fall into a standard distribution and variance in the data is often significant. Typically, ANNs make use of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) which is made up of multiple perceptrons arranged in layers of three or more, consisting of input, hidden and output layers. These consider the predictor variables, perform feature detection through an activation function and output the results of the algorithm respectively.\nANNs have been successfully used to predict and classify data in different contexts, such as early detection [103] , prediction of long-term survival [104] and biomarker discovery in breast cancer [102, 105] , classification of colorectal cancer tissues [106] and discrimination between benign and malignant endothelial lesions [107] . One of the major disadvantages of ANNs is their liability to overfit when the parameters have not been optimised. Moreover, they often receive criticism for their \"black box\" approach which allows for little to no interpretation of the results and process.\nSupport Vector Machines. Support Vector Machines (SVM) are supervised classification and regression algorithms that are primarily designed to solve binary problems. They are focussed on finding a hyperplane which separates two classes [108] and have been successfully used in pattern recognition and classification. The popularity of SVMs is a result of the availability of a large variety of kernels (functions that separate data) which can be broadly split into linear, polynomial, sigmoid and radial basis function categories. The greatest advantage of SVMs when compared to similar machine learning methods, is that selecting the correct kernel function enables the analysis of non-linear data, and overcomes the curse of dimensionality.\nHowever, the introduction of more features increases the complexity, and therefore the computing power required. Notwithstanding the practical issues, SVMs have been used for analysing high density data, such as RNA, miRNA and proteomics, and they remain one of the most popular classification methods, especially for cancer prediction and prognosis [109] [110] [111] [112] .\nAs indicated above, disadvantages of SVMs include the computational processing power and the time, although much like ANNs, these problems are quickly being addressed. A more crucial issue facing the application of SVMs is choosing the appropriate parameters and kernel that will allow for sufficient generalization because of the high algorithmic complexity which is required for 'real' data. As a result, the use of SVMs is less supported in settings which require interpretation and decision-making [108] . Bayesian Networks. Bayes theory states that the conditional probability of A given B is the conditional probability of B given A scaled by the relative probability of A compared to B. Using"}, {"section_title": "Decision Trees and Random", "text": "Bayesian networks, the association between a set of variables or nodes can be determined through joint conditional probability distributions [113] .\nAlthough such approaches have been used for multiple biological applications such as inferring cellular networks, modelling protein signalling pathways, data integration, genetic data analysis and classification [114] [115] [116] , they are limited by the fact that they need larger than average datasets to obtain sufficient prior probabilities to produce an accurate outcome.\nThis in turn makes them extremely computationally expensive. Moreover, they tend to perform poorly on high dimensional data and their output tends to be complex and as such, can be hard to interpret for non-specialists. Finally, it should be noted that Bayesian networks are not truly Bayesian in nature. They simply adhere to the basic rules of Bayesian statistics on probabilistic inference. It would be more accurate to say that Bayesian networks are directed graphical models with Bayesian elements."}, {"section_title": "Unsupervised Learning.", "text": "Unsupervised machine learning approaches are used when the desirable or predefined output is not available. The goal of unsupervised learning problems is to discover the structure of the data and define groups of similar examples, commonly called clustering. Clustering is one of the main unsupervised approaches and it functions by assigning data points to natural categorical classes or groups, based on similarity or difference of patterns without prior training [117] .\nUnsupervised learning approaches are best used when the subject is a very large dataset with few known variables. This allows the user to find natural patterns in the data and discover novel groups that have not been previously established and using which training can be undertaken. They have been most commonly used to distinguish patterns in microarray data by clustering genes based on their expression levels [118] [119] [120] .\nHierarchical Clustering. Hierarchical clustering, the most common unsupervised learning technique, has been widely used for the analysis of microarray data. It is based on measuring distances between data points and defining the first instance of each point as a single cluster, followed by merging the clusters according to distance, with smaller distances between clusters indicating greater similarity. The process continues in an iterative manner until all samples have been used to produce a phylogenetic tree-like structure of the clusters (dendrogram), with individual samples at the bottom, and a cluster containing every element in the dataset at the top [117] . Some of the most popular methods to determine cluster hierarchy include Single-linkage, Complete-linkage, Average-linkage and Centroid distance.\nThe major limitation of the hierarchical clustering approach is that as the clusters grow, they might not be representative of the objects within, and it is hard to rectify mistakes that occur early in the clustering process.\nK-means Clustering. Much like hierarchical clustering, K-means clustering is a partition algorithm which works by arbitrarily grouping objects into a predetermined number of clusters in an iterative manner. The centroid-average expression of each cluster is assigned randomly, based on the Euclidean distance between each object and the closest cluster average. The algorithm then recalculates the average centroid expression, based on the mean of all objects assigned to it, and repeats the process until convergence is reached, where the average expression of each cluster does not change significantly [117] . Unlike hierarchical clustering, this method has the advantage of being able to deal with large datasets and as a result has been applied to more complex problems. However, the major drawback of this method is that repeating the test can produce significantly different results, as the final assignment of clusters is dependent on the initial random assignment of objects [121] .\nPrinciple Component Analysis. Reduction in dimensionality is often necessary for a visual inspection of high-dimensional data, as the number of variables being investigated often exceed the number of samples. This leads to data points being scarcely distributed in a high dimensional feature space [122] . The aim of Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is to map the original data into its principle components by linearly transforming the data to reduce dimensionality. These principle components are orthogonally arranged, mutually uncorrelated linear combinations of the original variables and are often ranked by the amount of variance they can explain in the data. The highest ranked components contain most of the relevant information, whereas low ranked principle components can be removed if they are not required. This approach is often used as a visualisation tool and pre-processing step for classification and clustering [117] ."}, {"section_title": "Novel Approaches. Two bioinformatics approaches developed recently have managed to", "text": "provide novel solutions to common problems related to big data analysis.\nCIBERSORT. CIBERSORT is a platform for characterising the cell composition of tissues based on their gene expression profiles [41] . Traditionally, immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry have been used to answer such questions and, although highly successful, they are limited by their reliance on known markers as well as the fact that these techniques are harmful to cells, likely altering the results. CIBERSORT manages to achieve similar results to these techniques using the RNA mixtures of the desired tissue. It is an SVM regression algorithm which allows the user to differentiate cell types in large datasets. CIBERSORT has been proven to have superior performance and be substantially more accurate over traditional Machine Leaning methods when the samples studied were unknown, noisy or closely related.\nHowever, limitations include its reliance on a reference database, the fidelity and size of which are considerable factors in the algorithm's ability to classify the cell samples, the lack of a p values for detection limits and a systematic over-and under-estimation of certain cell types.\nMuch like all major machine learning approaches, these problems are being mitigated as more computing power becomes available and the size and fidelity of databases increases.\nHive Plots. One of the key challenges in the field of bioinformatics is the issue of visualisation.\nAlthough the approaches discussed previously have expanded the field of biomarker discovery by allowing researchers to consider new possibilities, their use in diagnostics is limited by the fact that the results often require expert specialists to interpret. If these approaches are to achieve widespread use by clinicians for prognosis, it is paramount to have a clear and easily understandable output. Developed by Krzywinski et al. [123] , hive plots offer an alternative network visualisation method to traditional maps. These maps, usually produced by software such as Cytoscape, Gephi, Netminer and more recently, programming languages such as R, have a tendency to include an overwhelming amount of information, leading to networks that need to be analysed with sorting algorithms to be readable and hard to interpret.\nMoreover, complexity increases exponentially as more information is included. Hive plots offer a rational visualisation technique which groups nodes based on specific properties determined by the user. The properties can be inherent network statistics, or information such as features of clinical data."}, {"section_title": "Expert commentary", "text": "A patient's immunological profile should be considered a highly dynamic framework, which is affected by variations in tumour genetics, epigenetics and micro-RNA expression, age, microbiome composition, pharmacological agents and environmental factors including infections and exposure to sunlight [21] . There is an emerging need to identify immune biomarkers of cancer response to immunotherapies [39] . High-dimensional technologies will also enhance our understanding of TME-cancer interactions and will support the prediction of therapeutic benefit from immune-based interventions (Figure 3) . Immune assays for biomarker discovery, as well as sample collection and handling, must be harmonised and standardised for investigators to be able to compare and share results [3] .\nAlthough the role of immune gene signatures in stratifying patients with haematological malignancies and in supporting clinical decision making remains to investigated, efforts are being devoted to the discovery of prognostic signatures (to predict outcome independent of therapy), predictive signatures (to assist in treatment selection according to therapeutic effectiveness) and mechanistic immune signatures in patients with solid tumours [124, 125] .\nPrognostic signatures help predict outcome independent of therapy, whereas predictive Finally, new bioinformatics approaches are being developed to unravel the complexity and multi-dimensionality of datasets obtained through transcriptomic, sequencing and proteomic techniques, to identify responders and non-responders and to stratify and select patients based on immune gene signatures in the TME [127] . In the foreseeable future, immune biomarkers might guide the development and personalisation of combination immunotherapy approaches [10] . As machine learning is becoming an integral part of biomarker discovery, it presents its own set of challenges with the first one being the constant need for higher computational power. As the size of the available datasets and the complexity of the platform technologies (e.g. the move to 1million SNIP probes on a chip, or the advent of RNA deepSeq. studies) increases, computational requirements will increase exponentially. While current advances in GPU-accelerated parallel computing, solid-state drives and the availability of highly parallel cloud computing solutions have allowed for a significant increase in processing power, it is proving insufficient to handle some of the more complex questions. There is also a trend occurring where the processing power increases so the analyses that are conducted become deeper and more detailed.\nThe quality and size of the datasets is a key factor in ensuring high quality results. Not only have the standards for size been raised, with datasets like METABRIC and databases like TCGA, TARGET, ADNI and others providing access to data from thousands of cases, but the quality desired in such data is going to keep increasing as well. This is compounded by the fact that as more data becomes publically available it can be used to validate tests results with ever-increasing accuracy. If comparative analysis is conducted across multiple cancers of different tissue origin (so called pan cancer studies) or between the ever-increasing number of molecular subtypes of given cancers a greater need for processing will be required.\nFinally, further research is required in the more recent areas of machine learning, primary among them being network inference studies and the so called deep learning and deep mining strategies. Understanding how questions of interest interact and affect each other, such as how genes regulate each other in a given disease, and use machine learning to model more possibilities than could be reasonably studied manually [75] will further increase the potential venues of research."}, {"section_title": "Key issues", "text": "\uf0b7 Identification of predictive/prognostic immune biomarkers in the blood and TME of "}]
