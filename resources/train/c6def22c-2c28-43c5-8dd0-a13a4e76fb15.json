In addition, I would also like to thank my friends, colleagues, the department faculty, and staff for making my time at Iowa State University a wonderful experience. I want to also offer my appreciation to the study participants, without whom, this dissertation would not have been possible. Next, my colleagues at Western Michigan University deserve a special thanks for all of their support as I finished my dissertation and started my career. Finally, this dissertation is dedicated to my family. To my husband John, who saw my potential and encouraged me to start graduate school. To my daughters Evelyn and Amelia, who were my guiding lights as I finished this process. Latinos households (22.4 percent) than among the U.S. households as a whole (14 percent) (Coleman-Jensen et al., 2015). Additionally, even though the percent of Latinos with a major depressive episode in the past year is lower than that of among all U.S. adults (5.8%, 6.7% respectively), depression is a concern among the Latino population (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2014). In addition to being the largest minority group in the U.S. (17% of the U.S. population), Latinos account for more than 50 percent of the total population growth in the U.S. during the past ten years . Moreover, the Latino population has increased across rural America. Between 2010 and 2013, there was a 2.1 percent increase in the Latino population in nonmetro areas, compared to a -0.2 percent decrease for non-Latinos in non-metro areas (Rural Hispanic Population Growth Mirrors National Trends, 2014). Additionally, between 2000 and 2010, the Latino population increased by 49% in the Midwest . In a study of rural children who lived in households that had low incomes, Evans and English (2002) showed that exposure to numerous physical and psychosocial stressors elevate the risk of socioemotional difficulties among rural children. Thus, the impact of multiple stressors such as food insecurity and depressive symptoms on rural Latino families that have low household incomes may be substantial. The Family Stress Model (FSM) , which proposes that economic hardship increases the risk of negative family functioning, parenting and child well-being, guides the studies in this dissertation. Parke and colleagues (2004) examined economic stress, parenting, and child adjustment in Mexican American families in California, while this dissertation examines Latina mothers living in rural areas across the nation, the majority of whom are first generation immigrants. While the FSM originally posited how socioeconomic status affected adult romantic relationships , it was later posited that socioeconomic status impacts parenting and child development . The FSM proposes that economic hardship is positively associated with economic pressure (perceived economic constraints and economic adjustments), and that both economic hardship and economic pressure are positively related to emotional and behavioral problems among parents. Such problems are related to harsh and inconsistent parenting, and mediated by the degree of conflict between parents. In turn, harsh, inconsistent parenting is hypothesized to have a positive association with child emotional and behavior problems . The FSM provides a framework in which to explore the economic hardship of household food insecurity, emotional and behavioral problems related to maternal depressive symptoms, and behavior problems of children in rural Latino households. In this dissertation, data from two multi-state Experiment station research projects are examined to understand how stressors experienced by rural Latino families are related to child behavior and child health. The Family Stress Model is applied as a theoretical underpinning in both studies. The first study will use data from the Rural Families Speak about Health project to examine relations between household food insecurity, maternal depressive symptoms, alliance between parents, and child behaviors among rural Latino families who have low household incomes. The second study will use data from both the Rural Families Speak project, and the Rural Families Speak about Health project, to examine relations among household food insecurity, maternal depressive symptoms, and child health among rural Latino families. The Rural Families Speak project was based on data collected from 534 rural families across 17 states that had low household incomes between 2002 and 2007, and was primarily focused on family economic well-being in the context of the 1996 federal welfare reform (Bauer, 2004;Bauer & Katras, 2007). The Rural Families Speak about Health project was based on data collected in 2011 from 444 rural families across 13 states that had low household incomes and primarily focused on the mental and physical health of families (Mammen & Sano, 2013)."}, {"section_title": "Dissertation Organization", "text": "This dissertation is organized using the manuscript format, and the manuscripts included in the dissertation will be submitted for publication.

L. 88-525) became law in 1964, cementing the federal government's role in helping people obtain food. This law has undergone many changes, and today, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), has replaced what was formerly referred to as the Food Stamp Program. SNAP participation has been associated with reduced household food insecurity (Mabli, Ohl, Dragoset, Castner, & Santos, 2013). The estimated average SNAP benefit for a family of four in 2015 was $459.00 per month (Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 2015), and prices for food such as retail meat, eggs, fish and seafood, dairy, and fresh fruit have continued to increase due to the interplay between climate change and economic forces (Economic Research Service USDA Food Price Outlook, 2016). Despite programs that assist families with purchasing food, households still experience food insecurity. Household food insecurity was first measured quantitatively by the USDA in 1995 as a way to examine how many households in the United States were experiencing food insecurity. The development of this quantitative measure was partially in response to an increased demand for emergency food by individuals and families that occurred in the 1980s (Food Research and Action Center). Household food insecurity affects families by acting as a stressor that is linked to depression.\nHousehold food insecurity was measured using the Six-Item Short Form of the USDA Household Food Security Module and the associated Six-Item Food Security Scale (Bickel, Nord, Price, Hamilton, & Cook, 2000). Some questions required mothers to choose \"Often true\", \"Sometimes true\" or \"Never true\" to questions such as \"I couldn't afford to eat balanced meals.\" and \"The food that I bought just didn't last, and I didn't have money to get more\". Other questions required a yes or no response, such as \"In the last 12 months, were you ever hungry but didn't eat because there wasn't enough money for food?\" and \"In the last 12 months, did you ever eat less than you felt you should because there wasn't enough money for food?\" In RFS, household food insecurity was measured by the 18-item U.S. Household Food Security Module with a 12-month reference period (Hamilton et al., 1997).

Household food insecurity and maternal depressive symptoms predict each other over time, indicating a parallel causal relationship. Browder and colleagues (2013) found that rural Latina immigrant mothers whose depressive symptoms remained high had increased levels of food insecurity when compared to mothers with consistently low depressive symptoms.

These risks can begin prenatally, and include birth defects . Among food insecure children under age three, iron deficiency with anemia is twice as likely to occur when compared to food secure children . Young children's general health can also be impacted, with parents of food insecure preschoolers more likely to rate their child's health lower and for those young children to be hospitalized for health problems . The odds of parents rating their child's health lower was associated with households that were consistently food insecure . More Latino children reside in households that are food insecure that White, non-Hispanic children (29% and 15% respectively) (Coleman-Jensen, Rabbitt, Gregory, & Singh, 2015). Further, of the 89 counties with a majority Latino population in 2013 (3% of all counties in the U.S.), more than one-fourth (27%) are among the top 10 percent of counties with the highest rates of household food insecurity among children (Gundersen, Satoh, Dewey, Kato, & Engelhard, 2015).

Externalizing and internalizing behaviors in young children are related to other issues, such as a lack of effortful control (Murray & Kochanska, 2002), peer rejection (Wood, Cowan, & Baker, 2002), and academic difficulties (Hinshaw, 1992) during middle childhood.. There are long term associations of externalizing behavior problems with substance abuse (King, Iacono, & McGue, 2004), smoking (Helstrom, Bryan, Hutchison, Riggs, & Blechman, 2004), antisocial outcomes (Lynam, 1996), underachievement (Hinshaw, 1992), and lower graduation rates from high school (McLeod & Kaiser, 2004). Similarly, there are long term associations of internalizing behavior problems with adolescent depression (Reinherz, Giaconia, Pakiz, Silverman, Frost, & Lefkowitz, 1993), illegal substance use (King et al., 2004), and increased risk of high school dropout (McLeod & Kaiser, 2004). Children had higher odds of behavior problems when their mother was food insecure, even after adjusting for mother's mental health issues and other covariates . The association between food insecurity and child behaviors is mediated by parenting stress (Huang, Oshima, and Kim, 2010). Family background and characteristics of parents had a strong impact on child behaviors (Huang, Oshima, and Kim, 2010). Belsky, Moffit, Arseneault, Melchoir and Caspi (2010) found maternal characteristics of mothers of food insecure children included being less open to experience, less reliable, less affable, less extraverted and more anxious (Belsky, Moffit, Arseneault, Melchior, & Caspi, 2010). Meta-analyses provide further evidence that household food insecurity is a stressor with direct and indirect effects on behavior in children . This dissertation will add to the literature by examining household food insecurity and child behavior and the mediating roles of depressive symptoms and parenting alliance among rural Latino families, a population that is underrepresented in research. Household food insecurity is not the only stressor related to child behavior. Maternal depression increases the risk for internalizing and externalizing behavior problems among children . Meta-analyses provide further evidence of direct effects between maternal depression and children's internalizing and externalizing behaviors . Stronger effect sizes were found for younger children, while there was a stronger effect size for girls when looking at maternal depression and internalizing behavior. More research is needed to examine different types of risk factors in mothers and children that are associated with internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in children . This dissertation explores the combination of household food insecurity, depressive symptoms, and parenting alliance as risk factors that may contribute to behavior problems in children. Not only are maternal depressive symptoms shown to impact child behaviors, they impact parenting behaviors as well. Maternal depression constrains a mother's capability to nurture children (Gotlib & Goodman, 1999;Kiernan & Huerta, 2008). Due to maternal depression, the home may be more stressful  and the mother may be more negative and hostile to her children (Downey & Coyne, 1990;Lovejoy, Graczyk, O'Hare, & Neuman, 2000). Meta-analyses provide further evidence of direct effects between maternal depression and negative parenting behavior (Lovejoy, et al., 2000). Parenting alliance, defined as how primary caregivers work together and communicate about their shared task of child-rearing (Weissmann & Cohen, 1985), is typically studied among White, middle class populations. A weaker alliance between primary caregivers is associated with adjustment and behavior issues among children and adolescents (Feinberg, Kan, & Hetherington, 2007;McConnel & Kerig, 2002). Cabrera, Shannon, Mitchell, & West (2009) examined a nationally representative sample of Mexican-American parents, and found that alliance was not related to adjustment of 2 year-olds. However, among Latino parents, a weaker parenting alliance predicted more externalizing problems for young adolescent sons (Lindahl & Malik, 1999). It may be that child age and stage of development is a moderator in the relation between parenting alliance and child behavior problems."}, {"section_title": "Medical need and depression", "text": "Delays in medical treatment, delays in purchasing medicines, and low health care system usage are all indicators of medical need . Although medical need is seldom isolated as a specific type of material hardship, and little is known about medical need as a construct, Ashiabi and O'Neal (2007) found that medical need was associated with depression. A characteristic of medical need, lack of medical care, was positively associated with an increased risk of depression among parents who are not married (Heflin & Iceland, 2009). )."}, {"section_title": "Theoretical framework", "text": "The Family Stress Model originally posited how socioeconomic status affected adult romantic relationships , and it was later extended to posit how socioeconomic status impacts parenting and child development .

In the extended FSM, a main hypothesis is that economic hardship and child problems are mediated by disrupted parenting . This model is a good fit for the studies because household food insecurity and medical need are types of economic hardships. Maternal depressive symptoms are related to the theory because depression involves emotions and behaviors that are problematic for other family members. Parenting alliance is related to how disrupted family relations are or are not. In this dissertation, the Family Stress Model is applied to examine relations between family stressors and child outcomes among Latino families living in rural America. Household food insecurity, maternal depressive symptoms and parenting alliance may each operate differently among rural Latino families, and in turn could impact child behaviors. Material hardships such as household food insecurity and family medical need, as well as maternal depressive symptoms may impact child health in unique ways.\nThe FSM proposes that economic hardship is positively associated with economic pressure, and that both economic hardship and economic pressure are positively related to parent emotional and behavioral problems. These parental problems are related to harsh and inconsistent parenting, and mediated by interparental conflict. In turn, harsh, inconsistent parenting is hypothesized to have a positive association with child emotional and behavior problems . The primary hypothesis of the extended FSM is that disrupted parenting is the mediator between economic hardship and child problems . The current study replicates part of the Family Stress Model (FSM)  which proposes that economic hardship increases the risk of negative family functioning, negative parenting and compromised child development and well-being. The current study proposes that food insecurity increases the risk of maternal depressive symptomology; thereby disrupting the alliance between primary caregivers, and thus leading to increased child internalizing and externalizing behavior problems (see Figure 1).\nThe current study extends the Family Stress Model (FSM) which  suggests that economic hardship increases the risk of negative family functioning, negative parenting and child well-being. While the FSM first hypothesized how socioeconomic status affected romantic relationships between adults , it was later extended to hypothesize how socioeconomic status impacts parenting and child development . In their extension of the FSM, Conger and Conger suggest that economic hardship is positively associated with economic pressure, and that both economic hardship and economic pressure are positively related to emotional and behavioral problems in parents. These problems in parents are associated with harsh and inconsistent parenting, and mediated by conflict between parents. In turn, harsh, inconsistent parenting is theorized to have a positive association with emotional and behavior problems in children .

Household food insecurity is a complex phenomenon that centers on constrained and unpredictable accessibility of, and ability to obtain food . The ability to obtain food is related to economic resources in the household that are used to purchase food, while accessibility is related to all household members having enough safe and nutritional food throughout the year. Several factors including policies, economics, and individual factors related to low income, such as education and employability, increase this phenomena among immigrant families in the U.S. (Koball, Liu, Morgan, & Clary, 2013;Grieco, et al., 2012). Family stress has a negative impact on child behaviors, such as when a family has difficulty regularly accessing enough food (Slopen, Fitzmaurice, Williams, & Gilman, 2010;Fiese, Gundersen, Koester, & Washington, 2011). Internalizing and externalizing behavior problems are associated with household food insecurity (Whitaker, Philips & Orzol, 2006;. Parenting stress has been shown to be a mediator between household food insecurity and problem behaviors in children (Huang, Oshima, & Kim, 2010). In addition to barriers such as larger distances to food and health resources ) that rural families may face in meeting basic needs, Latino families residing in rural communities commonly face additional barriers. Low incomes, limited formal education, limited English language proficiency, lack of trained interpreters and culturally competent health care providers commonly present additional challenges for Latino immigrant families in accessing food and health resources (Cristancho, Garces, Peters & Mueller, 2008)."}, {"section_title": "Furthermore, studies have revealed values and beliefs regarding food held by", "text": "Latino families in the U.S. (Gomel & Zamor, 2007;).

This paucity in research is especially disadvantageous to rural Latino families, since this group is the fastest growing group in rural areas (Kandel & Cromatie, 2004) and rural communities are already underserved, especially in regards to mental health care (Campbell, Gordon & Chandler, 2002). The present exploratory study proposes to extend aspects of the study of urban The current exploratory study replicates the FSM  in some aspects. Household food insecurity is conceptualized as separate from financial distress. Parents' emotional state is conceptualized as depressive symptoms in mothers. Instead of directly measuring interparental conflict or withdrawal, the current study examines the quality of co-parenting between primary caregivers from the perspective of mothers. Parenting behavior and parenting style is omitted from the current study. In a similar fashion to the FSM, child behavior is conceptualized as externalizing and internalizing. Finally, the current study posits direct effects of household food insecurity to child behavior problems, and is theoretically similar to the direct effect from economic pressure to marital problems found in Finland (Kinnunen & Feldt, 2004), Korea (Kwon, Rueter, Lee, Koh & Ok, 2003) and Turkey (Aytac & Rankin, 2009). In this exploratory study, we hypothesized that higher levels of food insecurity will be associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms in mothers, and higher levels of internalizing and externalizing child behaviors. Additionally, we predicted that the relationship between household food insecurity and child behaviors will be mediated by maternal depressive symptoms and alliance among parents. Furthermore, we tested the model with financial distress (how mothers feel about their financial situation) as a control variable in order to understand the unique contribution of food insecurity to depressive symptoms above and beyond that of financial distress. We test these hypotheses using two groups, mothers with children 1 \u00bd years old to 5 years old, and mothers with children 6 to 12 years old because there may be differences behavior between the age groups due to developmental processes.\nThere is a dearth of research about rural families from racial or ethnic minority groups. While the FSM have been tested with ethnically diverse, low-income families with young children, , most families lived in urban areas. This gap in research is especially detrimental to rural Latino families, since they are the fastest growing group in rural areas (Kandel & Cromatie, 2004) and rural communities already are underserved in the area of health (U.S. Government Accountability Office). This study proposes to extend the FSM in two ways. First, unique aspects of material hardship, specifically household food insecurity and medical need, will be examined, as these constructs may have strong associations with child health. Second, child well-being is conceptualized as child health. This extension allows for a unique set of variables to be examined among rural Latino families. It is expected that higher levels of food insecurity and medical need will be associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms in mothers, and higher levels of health problems in children. The relationship between the material hardships of food insecurity and medical need and child health problems will be mediated by maternal depressive symptoms. Direct, positive associations between the material hardship variables and child health problems are also expected. In addition, the model will be tested with mother's education level, mother's age, and child's age as controls. The demographic variable of mothers' education level is related to socioeconomic status, a potential confounder even though the sample is all lowincome. Mothers' age and age of child is used as a control because age could be a possible confounder, as age could explain the associations among variables."}, {"section_title": "Household food insecurity and depression", "text": "Household food insecurity is associated with depressive symptoms among rural mothers Lent, Petrovi, Swanson, & Olson, 2009).

In their review of how household food insecurity affects child development, Perez-Escamilla and Vianna 2012found strong evidence of household food insecurity as a strong stressor with potential direct and indirect effects on child behavior. Research about the relationship between food insecurity and child behavior has also focused on potential mediators. Huang, Oshima, and Kim (2010) found parenting stress mediated the relationship between food insecurity and child behaviors. However, short-term household food insecurity was not as impactful as family background and parental characteristics on child behaviors. Additionally, mothers of food insecure children were less open to experience, less conscientious, less agreeable, less extraverted and more neurotic (Belsky, Moffit, Arseneault, Melchior, & Caspi, 2010). Other researchers examined how maternal depression impacts parenting behaviors. Studies reveal that maternal depression leads to an overall reduction in a mother's ability to care for and raise children (Gotlib & Goodman, 1999;Kiernan & Huerta, 2008). For example, depressed mothers may create living environments that are more stressful  or demonstrate more negative and hostile behaviors toward their children (Downey & Coyne, 1990;Lovejoy, Graczyk, O'Hare, & Neuman, 2000). In their meta-analytic review, Lovejoy and colleagues (2000) found maternal depression to be strongly associated with negative parenting behavior, with a weaker association with disengagement from the child. Although current depression had the largest effects on parenting, past depression had residual effects on parenting as well. Maternal depression may also place children at risk for internalizing and externalizing behavior problems . A recent meta-analysis reported statistically significant, yet small effect sizes, for relationships between maternal depression and children's internalizing and externalizing behaviors . There were some differences in effect sizes due to gender and child age.

The degree of alliance between primary caregivers is important to examine when looking at child behavior outcomes. The Family Stress Model  is an appropriate framework to apply to this study because the stressor of household food insecurity is examined while controlling for financial distress. Maternal depressive symptoms and parenting alliance were examined as potential mediators between household food insecurity and child behavior. The purpose of this exploratory study was to determine if maternal depressive symptoms and parenting alliance served as mediators in the relationship between household food insecurity and child internalizing and externalizing behaviors. While these two variables did not serve as mediators in the relationship, an increase in maternal depressive symptoms was significantly related to a decrease in parenting alliance among mothers who had older children (6 to 12 years old), while controlling for financial distress. Additionally, among mothers who had older children, there were two associations that trended toward significance. First, the association between household food insecurity and parenting alliance trended toward significance, showing the possibility that an increase in household food insecurity was associated with an increase in parenting alliance, while controlling for financial distress. While the direction of this association may seem contrary to expectations, it is possible that mothers experiencing increased food insecurity form a stronger alliance with their co-parent/caregiver to protect against the stress of household food insecurity. It may be that when facing the stressor of household food insecurity, levels of cohesion increase between the primary caregivers, creating a stronger alliance (Olson, 2000). The second association with a trend toward significance was between household food insecurity and child externalizing behavior. This possible association is consistent with the literature (Whitaker, Philips & Orzol, 2006;Slopen, Fitzmaurice, Williams, & Gilman, 2010;. While this direct relation is not explained by mechanisms related to family processes, it may be more physiological in nature, with the physical consequences of household food insecurity directly increasing externalizing behaviors among children. While none of the associations for the group of younger children were significant, one did trend toward significance. Similar to the significant association for the group of older children, there was a trend that showed the possibility that an increase in maternal depressive symptoms was related to a decrease in parenting alliance. Maternal depressive symptoms are a stressor that reduces cooperation between parents and this is reflected in lower levels of parenting alliance. While acknowledging that trends toward significance are indeed not significant, it is interesting to note the possibility that household food insecurity and depressive symptoms are stressors that affect parenting alliance in opposite ways. While commonly one would expect stressors to have a negative association with parenting alliance, in this study, only depressive symptoms had this association.\nRural Latino families frequently experience many stressors, including those of household food insecurity and depressive symptoms that can affect child health . The material hardship of household food insecurity, along with maternal depressive symptoms is important to consider when examining child health outcomes. The Family Stress Model  is an applicable framework for this study because the stressors of household food insecurity, and medical need are examined in relation to maternal depression and child health problems. The purpose of the study was to determine if maternal depressive symptoms served as mediator in the relationship between household food insecurity and child health problems. Maternal depressive symptoms was found to be a mediator, consistent with findings from Tinkew and colleagues (2007).\nRural Latina mothers contend with numerous stressors, such as household food insecurity and depressive symptoms that can affect child behavior (Whitaker, Philips & Orzol, 2006; and health . The purpose of this dissertation was to study relations between family and individual stressors and child outcomes using the Family Stress Model as a theoretical underpinning in two quantitative studies. The relations between the variables examined in this dissertation, and the findings, can be explained theoretical underpinnings of the Family Stress Model . Household food insecurity and medical need are viewed as material hardship stressors similar to  concept of economic hardship, while maternal depressive symptoms are related to the construct of parental emotional and behavioral problems. Parenting alliance expands on the idea of degree of conflict between parents in the FSM, and the child behavior and child health outcomes in this dissertation are similar to child outcomes used in the FSM. The overarching research question for this dissertation examined the relations between stressors in rural Latino households and child behavior and child health. In study one, the researchers hypothesized that household food insecurity would be positively associated with maternal depressive symptoms and internalizing and externalizing child behaviors. It was predicted that maternal depressive symptoms and parenting alliance would mediate the relationship between household food insecurity and child behaviors. In study two, the researchers hypothesized that food insecurity and medical need would be positively associated with depressive symptoms in mothers, and health problems in children. It was hypothesized that maternal depressive symptoms would mediate the relation between the material hardships of household food insecurity and medical need and child health. In the first study, maternal depressive symptoms were related to a decrease in parenting alliance among mothers with children six to 12 years old. Neither maternal depressive symptoms, nor parenting alliance were found to be mediators for either age group. In fact, for the younger age group, there were no statistically significant results. This is contrary to the idea of sensitive periods in development occurring at younger ages, as it would be expected for stressors such as experiencing household food insecurity or experiencing parenting from a mother with depressive symptoms would impact child behavior at a young age. In the second study, household food insecurity was significantly and positively associated with maternal depressive symptoms, and maternal depressive symptoms were significantly and positively associated with an increase in child health problems among the sample from RFSH data. Maternal depressive symptoms was found to be a mediator, which is consistent with prior research . The hardship of medical need was not found to impact maternal depressive symptoms or child health.

In order to gain access to a population containing potential undocumented people, a nonprobability sample was used. Although this makes the study population non-representative of the rural Latina population as a whole and limits generalizability, it allows researchers to learn more about a population that is difficult to access. Next, the study design is based on self-reported data from mothers, which introduces bias due to social desirability. Additionally, each construct is measured only by one scale, which reduces convergent validity. Another limitation related to measures is that we did not measure inconsistent or harsh parenting, which is a part of the FSM. The data are cross sectional and no causal or predictive claims can be suggested. Finally, the sample size was small, which increases the likelihood of Type II error, that is, there may have been more significant results but the power to detect significant associations was limited by the sample size. Future studies should consider a random sampling strategy, the inclusion of viewpoints of other family members, the inclusion of observational data, measurement of constructs in multiple ways, longitudinal design, and an increased sample size. However, despite these limitations, the study contributes to the literature by including parenting alliance in an application of the FSM and examining a seldom studied population of rural Latino families. This exploratory study has strengths. A seldom studied population is examined within the framework of the well-known and extensively tested Family Stress Model , using measures that are reliable and valid, and financial distress is controlled for in an attempt to isolate household food insecurity as a stressor separate from financial distress."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In this study, it was clear that an increase in depressive symptoms was associated with a decrease in parenting alliance among rural Latina mothers who had children six to 12 years of age. Professionals, such as couple and family therapists and family life educators can work together to assess the stressors faced by families of rural Latina mothers, with a particular focus on depressive symptoms and on how well primary caregivers operate as a team. These can be measured easily during an office visit with a mental health professional. As with all families, it is important that rural Latino families have access to resources that can positively benefit them and their families so they can interact in an optimal manner. In order for primary caregivers to have a strong alliance, the opportunity to gain or maintain positive mental health is important. Positive mental health could be promoted, and depressive symptoms decreased, through increased access to mental health resources that are culturally relevant and professionals who are prepared to provide services to a predominantly Spanish speaking population. Another potential mode of accessing resources to promote positive mental health is telehealth, a method to deliver mental health services for people in rural areas (Brownlee, Graham, Doucette, Hotson, & Halverson, 2010). Telehealth has been shown to reduce depressive symptoms for rural, Mandarin-speaking immigrants who received treatment from a Mandarin-speaking therapist (Zheng & Gray, 2014). To increase opportunities for positive impact on mental health, it is important for these strategies to be enacted simultaneously and be specifically tailored to specific population groups of Latino immigrants. Increased access and use of mental health services may decrease depressive symptoms, and thereby increase alliance between primary caregivers as they care for their children.          Child health is influenced by a number of factors, including family income, health care access, insurance, behavior, and culture (Hughes & Ng, 2003). \nIn this study, higher levels of household food insecurity were associated with higher levels of maternal depressive symptoms, and maternal depressive symptoms were associated with an increase in child health problems. Professionals in health and mental health can work together to assess the stressors faced by families of rural Latino mothers. Maternal depressive symptoms and household food insecurity can be measured during a child's well-check examination, and through this screening, professionals can refer families to appropriate resources. All families deserve access to resources that support optimal physical and mental health, so they can function well as individuals. Community gardens may be an especially viable option for rural Latino families who may value fresh food over prepackaged food (Gomel & Zamor, 2007;. Culturally competent, bilingual professionals located in rural areas could provide mental health services to the predominately Spanish speaking Latino population, thus improving mental health through treatment of those with higher levels of depressive symptoms. One way to overcome the distance barrier inherent in rural areas and increase access to rural Latino families is through telehealth (Brownlee, Graham, Doucette, Findings from this study suggest that associations between household food insecurity, maternal depressive symptoms and child health problems should be further explored in longitudinal studies so causal order can be determined."}, {"section_title": "Health among Latino children", "text": "Latino children in the United States experience health disparities. When compared to non-Latino White children born in the United States, Latino children regardless of immigration family type had higher odds of obesity, and poor physical and dental health . Additionally, Latino children face greater odds of hospitalization and death due to injuries (Agran, Winn, Anderson, & Del Valle, 1998), less than optimal health status, (Flores, Bauchner, Feinstein & Nguyen, 1999) and a decreased likelihood of receiving the following: vision screening, prescriptions, adequate pain medication, and high quality care for asthma and gastroenteritis (Flores, Abreu, Olivar, & Kastner, 1998). The current study will extend the Family Stress Model to include child health and examine two unique populations of rural Latina mothers to examine differences before and after the Great Recession. Rural Latina mothers prior to the Great Recession may have experienced material hardship and depressive symptoms differently than rural Latina mothers after the Great Recession, thus leading to differences in child health. Health risks faced by Latino children pose unique challenges to rural communities, as the Latino population increased by 49% between 2000 -2010 in the Midwest . In addition to barriers experienced by many rural residents, such as increased distance to food and health resources , Latino families commonly face additional barriers such as limited English language proficiency. For example, in some rural communities, language barriers can be part of the challenge for Latinos in accessing health resources (Cristancho, Garces, Peters & Mueller, 2008). To help inform policy, knowing which stressors are more detrimental for rural Latino families is essential.

Little is known about medical need as a specific type of material hardship and its association with depression, since much of the research combines diverse types of hardship into one variable . Ashiabi and O'Neal (2007) found that medical need was related to depression. Additionally, lack of medical care was positively associated with an increased risk of depression among fragile families (parents who are not married) (Heflin & Iceland, 2009)."}, {"section_title": "Material hardship, depression, and child health", "text": "Although children in the U.S. who experience food insecurity are less likely to experience stunted growth and wasting as in other countries, the health related implications are substantial. Risks to health due to household food insecurity can begin prenatally, and include associations with birth defects . Iron deficiency with anemia is twice as likely to occur in food insecure children under age three, than food secure children . Food insecure preschoolers are more likely to have lower parental ratings of health and be hospitalized for health problems . Further, the risk of lower parental ratings of health is higher for children of recent immigrants and highest for newly arrived immigrants (Chilton et al., 2009).  found that persistent household food insecurity was associated with increased odds of lower child health status, and they also found that parents' depression was associated with increased odds of lower child health status. Propper, Rigg and Burgess (2007) found that the association between income and health diminished when controlling for maternal mental health. The material hardship of medical need was found to have an indirect effect on child health through parental depression, and parental depression was also associated with child health , whereas parental depression was found to mediate the relationship between food insecurity and physical health among toddlers .  found psychiatric symptoms in parents were related to a higher frequency of total illnesses over a year, and specifically a higher frequency of febrile illnesses."}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Data examined in this study are from two different, yet related studies that focused on rural low-income mothers and their families. The first project, Rural Families Speak (RFS), was a multi-state longitudinal study of rural low-income families focusing on the well-being of rural families in the context of the 1996 federal welfare reform (Bauer, 2004;Bauer & Katras, 2007).

However, only the ten items corresponding to the CES-D 10 were used in the study. In this sample, the Chronbach's alpha for the 10 corresponding items was .71 (n = 108). In RFSH, symptoms for depression in mothers was measured using the short form (CES-D 10) (Andresen, Malmgren, Carter, & Patrick, 1994) of the 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) . Mothers indicated how often they have felt or behaved in response to ten statements (i.e., I was bothered by things that usually don't bother me; I had trouble keeping my mind on what I was doing; I felt that everything I did was an effort). Responses options include: rarely or none of the time (less than 1 day = 0), some or a little of the time (1-2 days = 1), occasionally or a moderate amount of time (3-4 days = 2), and all of the time (5-7 days = 3). The Chronbach's alpha was .76 (n = 135). Child health (outcome variable). Both RFS and RFSH contain questions pertaining to child obesity, child asthma, child diabetes, ear infections, allergies, colds, flu, sinus, seizures, and permanent disability. The mothers in the RFSH study were asked if the focal child had those health problems. In the RFS study, the mother was asked about all children, and in this study we report on the first child. Affirmative answers were coded as 1, and negative answers as 0, and scores ranged from 0 to 10. A sum score was created from these items, with higher scores representing more health problems. Mothers' education level (control variable). RFS participants chose one of eight answer options that ranged from \"Eighth grade or less\" to \"Graduate degree\". RFSH participants were asked \"What is the highest grade or year of school you have completed?\" and were given nine answer options that ranged from \"Eighth grade or less\" to \"Graduate degree\". Mothers' age (control variable). In RFS and RFSH, mothers were asked \"How old are you?\" to determine their age. Children's age (control variable). For the RFS group, child age was recorded for all children who lived in the household 50 percent or more of the time. This study reports on the first child. For the RFSH group, age of focal child was calculated by asking mothers for the date of birth of their focal child and then using the date of the interview to determine child age."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "While this study contributes to the study of rural Latino families, there are limitations. First, purposive sampling was used, which makes the participants nonrepresentative of the rural Latina population as a whole, and limits generalizability. Next, the data are self-reported by mothers, which may introduce self-report bias due to social desirability. Additionally, convergent validity is reduced, as each construct is measured by one scale. The measure of medical need was created by the researchers, and is not a standardized measure. The data are cross sectional and no causal or predictive claims can be implied. Finally, the small sample size increases the likelihood of Type II error, and there may have been significant results that were undetectable due to low power. A random sampling strategy, interviews with other family members, observational data, measurement of constructs in multiple ways, longitudinal design, and an increased sample size should be considered by future researchers. Nonetheless, despite these limitations, this study adds to the literature on rural Latino families and stress.\nWhile this dissertation contributes to the study of rural Latino families and stress, there are limitations as well. First, the participants in the studies included in this dissertation were purposively sampled, which makes them non-representative of the population as a whole, and thus, limits the generalizability. Next, the studies rely on selfreport data, which may introduce bias due to social desirability. Each construct in the dissertation was measured by one scale, which reduces convergent validity. The measure of medical need was created by the researchers, and has not been tested in other populations, which could reduce reliability and validity. The dissertation uses data that are cross sectional, therefore, causal or predictive claims cannot be implied since temporal order is not established. Low power due to a small sample size in both studies likely contributed to Type II error, and thus, significant relations among variables were undetected. Empirical knowledge of rural Latino families can be strengthened by future researchers who consider attempting a random sampling strategy, interviews with other family members, observational data, measurement of constructs in multiple ways, longitudinal design, and an increased sample size. Despite these limitations, this study contributes to the literature on rural Latino families and stress. The exploratory studies in this dissertation have strengths. The well-known and widely tested Family Stress Model  is used to examine a difficult to sample and rarely studied population. prepackaged food, community gardens may be particularly beneficial resource (Gomel & Zamor, 2007;. Spanish speaking Latina mothers with elevated depressive symptoms in rural areas can benefit from access to culturally competent, bilingual mental health professionals. Telehealth is one option to eliminate the barrier to services in rural areas and increase access to mental health services for rural Latino families (Brownlee, Graham, Doucette, Hotson, & Halverson, 2010). To ensure rural Latino families gain access to necessary mental health services, whether in traditional office settings or through telehealth, there need to be initiatives to increase the number of mental health professionals who are both culturally competent and bilingual."}, {"section_title": "Figure 1", "text": "Conceptual model and hypothesized associations   Note: RFS \u03c7 2 (7) = 32.43, p = .0000; CFI = 0.000, RMSEA = .18; RFSH \u03c7 2 (7) = 8.991, p = .25; CFI = 0.86, RMSEA = 0.05 CI 90% [0.00, 0.12]. * Bias Controlled Bootstrap CHAPTER 4: GENERAL DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION"}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Future research should further examine maternal depressive symptoms, household food insecurity and child health in applications of the FSM among rural Latina mothers. Child gender may also be of interest as a moderator when looking at the outcomes of child behavior problems and child health. As researchers continue to explore material hardships, standardized measures for specific types of hardships should be developed, as different types of hardships may contribute to outcomes of interest in different ways. Findings from this dissertation suggest that associations between maternal depressive symptoms and parenting alliance, and associations between household food insecurity, maternal depressive symptoms and child health problems should be further explored in longitudinal studies so causal order can be determined."}]
