Results are discussed considering implications for future research and interventions for mothers, their children, and their partners.\nAdolescent mothers face significant challenges, and both their own and their children's functioning are often compromised (Grau, Wilson, Weller, Castellanos, & Duran, 2012) . In addition to coming from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, adolescents who become mothers are more likely to have histories of stressful life events, lower cognitive attainment, and poorer school performance than their nonparenting peers (Hoffman & Maynard, 2008) . Compared to adult mothers, adolescent mothers have a higher likelihood of being single and of raising their children in poverty (K. A. Moore, Hofferth, Wertheimer, Waite, & Caldwell, 1981) .\nConsistently, several studies have found relatively high rates of depressive symptoms in samples of adolescent mothers (Colletta, 1983; Leadbeater, Bishop, & Raver, 1996; Nadeem, Whaley, & Anthony, 2006) . Similarly, children of adolescent mothers are at risk for emotional and behavior problems, which, when present, begin to appear in their second year of life and become more pronounced throughout development (Brooks-Gunn & Furstenberg, 1986) . Following the normative parenting literature that highlights the impact of maternal depression on child development (Zahn-Waxler, Duggal, & Gruber, 2002) , research on adolescent mothers has focused on this link. A few studies documented significant associations (e.g., Hubbs-Tait, Osofsky, Hann, & Culp, 1994) . The adolescent literature has also linked children's emotional and behavior problems to the environmental risk factors present in the lives of young mothers (M. R. Moore & Brooks-Gunn, 2002) .\nHowever, this research has seldom included Latina adolescents, and little is known about the link between maternal depressive symptoms and children's behavior problems in this population or the factors that may protect these young families. This is of concern because Latina adolescents have the highest birthrate of any group within the United States (Martin et al., 2010) and are overrepresented among the poor (Cauce & Domenech-Rodriguez, 2002) , placing them at significant risk for compromised functioning. Our first goal was to examine the association between maternal depressive symptoms and child internalizing and externalizing problems in Latina adolescent mothers and their toddlers. We used Contreras and colleagues' conceptual model of the determinants of parenting competence among Latina adolescent mothers (Contreras, Narang, Ikhlas, & Teichman, 2002) to guide our study. Following the model's emphasis on accounting for contextual stressors when examining maternal and child adjustment, we considered the role of maternal depression in conjunction with environmental risk factors that may influence the adolescents' and their children's adjustment.\nWe also sought to uncover protective factors for the adjustment of the adolescents' children. We focused on the potential protective role of the adolescents' partners because they have emerged as a key source of support for young Latina mothers (Contreras et al., 2002) . Latina adolescent mothers are more likely to reside with and be in long-term relationships with partners than are adolescent mothers from other ethnic backgrounds (de Anda & Becerra, 1984; Wasserman, Brunelli, Rauh, & Alvarado, 1994) . Given their presence, examining partners' impact on child functioning and testing whether they buffer children from the risks associated with maternal depressive symptoms is important."}, {"section_title": "Maternal Depression and Child Outcomes", "text": "Research investigating the relation between maternal depression and child functioning has focused primarily on European American (EA) adult women and their children. Findings indicate that children of depressed mothers are at risk for a variety of negative outcomes throughout their life span. Specifically in toddlerhood, offspring of depressed mothers show poor self-regulation, tend to react poorly to stress, and are at increased risk for behavioral problems (Downey & Coyne, 1990; Zahn-Waxler et al., 2002) .\nMuch less research has been conducted with Latina mothers of any age or adolescent mothers of any ethnic background. The majority of these studies used self-reported maternal depressive symptoms and mother-reported child behavior. A few studies uncovered a relation between depressive symptoms and child behavior among adult Latina mothers and their school-aged children (Aisenberg, Trickett, Mennen, Saltzman, & Zayas, 2007; Dennis, Parke, Coltrane, Blacher, & Borthwick-Duffy, 2003; Pachter, Auinger, Palmer, & Weitzman, 2006) . The only study that included toddlers found that depressive symptoms related to aggression in a mixed sample with a relatively large portion of Latina adults (Malik et al., 2007) ; but this study tested only aggression, not externalizing problems more generally or any internalizing problems.\nTo date, the few studies examining this relation with adolescent mothers used primarily African American (AA) and EA mothers and their school-aged children. Studies with mixed samples of predominantly EA and AA adolescent mothers (Spieker, Larson, Lewis, Keller, & Gilchrist, 1999) and samples of primarily EA adolescent mothers (Rhule, McMahon, Spieker, & Munson, 2006) found a significant relation. Most studies did not investigate child internalizing and externalizing problems separately, but one mixed-sample study found a relation between depressive symptoms and these two child outcomes among adolescent mothers and their schoolaged children (Black et al., 2002) . Finally, only one study examined this relation in younger children. In a mixed sample of 44 adolescent mothers, depressive symptoms related to toddlers' internalizing, externalizing, and social skills problems (Hubbs-Tait et al., 1994) .\nTwo studies with ethnically mixed samples including relatively large proportions of Latina adolescent mothers documented a relation between depressive symptoms and child behavior. However, results were not reported separately by ethnicity, and no distinction was made between internalizing and externalizing problems. One study found that depressive symptoms were associated with child problem behaviors in 4-to 6-year-olds in a mixed sample of mostly AA (23% Latina) adolescent mothers (Yoshikawa, Rosman, & Hsueh, 2001 ). The other found that depressive symptoms correlated significantly with toddlers' total behavior problems (approximately 40% Latina, 51% AA adolescent mothers; Leadbeater & Bishop, 1994; Leadbeater et al., 1996) . Finally, the only study that examined this relation in a sample of entirely Latina adolescent mothers and their toddlers found that toddlers of mothers who reported more depressive symptoms displayed less positive affect and more distress when interacting with their mothers during mother-child interactions .\nThus, no studies of Latina adolescent mothers have related depressive symptoms to child internalizing and externalizing symptoms. In addition, research documenting associations between maternal depression and child behavior in adolescent samples has rarely examined internalizing and externalizing problems separately and has tended to disregard the role of contextual risk factors. The current study examined the role of depression vis-\u00e0-vis risk factors that contribute to both maternal symptoms and children's behavior problems and tested these relations separately for internalizing and externalizing problems.\nTwo hierarchical linear regressions tested the relations between depressive symptoms and child internalizing and externalizing problems, respectively (Table 2 ). In the first regression, depressive symptoms significantly related to more child internalizing problems. The addition of depressive symptoms accounted for 13.4% of the variance in the model, and neither negative life events nor economic strain remained significantly related to child internalizing problems with depressive symptoms in the model. Mediation analyses (Figure 1 ) indicated that depressive symptoms mediated the relation between life events and child internalizing problems. When including both negative life events and maternal symptoms in the model, the \u03b2 value for negative life events dropped from .22 to .05. Results of the Sobel test produced a z-score of 3.26, which is greater than the critical z-score of 1.96, indicating that this drop was statistically significant. The results suggest that maternal depressive symptoms explain the statistical relation between negative life events and child internalizing problems.\nIn the second regression, depressive symptoms related significantly to more child externalizing problems and accounted for 9% of the variance in the model. Negative life events remained significantly related to externalizing problems when depressive symptoms were included in the regression. Nonetheless, meditation analyses indicated that the strength of the association was significantly reduced by the presence of maternal symptoms in the model (Sobel test: z = 3.06, p = .002; Figure 2 ), suggesting that maternal depressive symptoms partially mediated the association between life events and child externalizing problems."}, {"section_title": "Role of Partner Involvement in Child Care", "text": "Given the detrimental effects of maternal depressive symptoms, it is important to identify factors that might protect young families. Although the literature on adolescent mothers has tended to disregard the role of partners, the small literature on Latina adolescent mothers suggests that partners are a key source of support for these young mothers (Contreras et al., 2002) . In fact, research with Latina adolescent mothers has found high rates of participants reporting relatively long-term relationships with partners during the years following the birth of their children ( Contreras, L\u00f3pez, Rivera-Mosquera, Raymond-Smith, & Rothstein, 1999; D. R. Moore, Florsheim, & Butner, 2007; Wasserman et al., 1994) . As such, these men are likely to be present and possibly involved in the care of the child. However, although studies have documented effects of partner involvement on maternal well-being Contreras, L\u00f3pez, et al., 1999) , no studies have examined the relations between partner involvement and child functioning in young Latino families.\nResearch with adolescent mothers of primarily AA descent indicates that contact with mothers' partners can impact children positively. The Baltimore Study of Teenage Motherhood found that children who reported strong relationships with their fathers or their mother's partners showed better employment and educational outcomes and lower depression levels than those who did not (Furstenberg & Harris, 1993) . Cooley and Unger (1991) reported that the number of years a partner lived in the household related to mother-reported child outcomes in 6-to 7-year-olds. Lastly, another study found that children who had high levels of mother-reported contact ( composite of father's prenatal romantic involvement with mother, postnatal contact with child, residential status, financial and child care support) with their fathers from birth to age 8 had fewer internalizing and externalizing problems at ages 8 and 10 (Howard, Lefever, Borkowski, & Whitman, 2006) .\nGiven this positive effect, it is reasonable to expect that partner child care involvement could act as a buffer for children of adolescent mothers in the face of maternal depressive symptoms. Parenting theories suggest that the presence of a healthy coparent in the context of having a depressed mother may be protective for children (Belsky, 1984) . Despite theoretical support for the buffering effect, few studies with adult parents have actually tested this effect; and they have found mixed results. One of these studies with adult families found only moderating effects of the quantity of father involvement for internalizing, not externalizing, behavior problems ( Mezulis, Hyde, & Clark, 2004) . Another study indicated a protective effect of child-reported positive father involvement on both internalizing and externalizing problems for children with depressed and nondepressed mothers, but with stronger effects for nondepressed mothers (Chang, Halpern, & Kaufman, 2007) .\nOne study provides evidence of a buffering effect among families of adolescent mothers. In a study of mainly AA adolescent mothers, Howard and colleagues (2006) tested the interaction of father contact and maternal risk on child outcomes. Findings indicated that father contact related to lower internalizing problems in children with a high-risk mother (e.g., low intelligence, low cognitive readiness, and high internalizing and externalizing problems), whereas father contact showed no relation to internalizing problems for children with low-risk mothers. This effect was not significant for child externalizing problems.\nThus, although findings are mixed, some empirical evidence suggests that partners of adolescent mothers could serve a protective role for the young children's behavior. In addition, studies have used different indicators of paternal involvement, and most have used maternal report on global indicators of involvement. Therefore, research has not identified which specific aspects of involvement are related to child functioning across domains. Given the relatively larger presence of partners in young Latino families, it is especially important to examine this potential protective factor in this population. To better inform intervention efforts, we focused specifically on one aspect of partner involvement: the care provided directly to the child."}, {"section_title": "The Present Study", "text": "The current study examined the concurrent relation of maternal depressive symptoms to child behavior in a sample of adolescent Latina mothers and their toddlers. Given research relating environmental risk factors to both maternal and child adjustment (M. R. Moore & Brooks-Gunn, 2002 ; Uma\u00f1a-Taylor, Updegraff, & Gonzales-Bracken, 2011), we tested this relation while controlling for these factors. We expected that maternal depressive symptoms would have a unique relation to children's behavior problems. Based on theory and empirical findings demonstrating that contextual risk factors affect children's adjustment through their effect on parents (Conger et al., 2002; Parke et al., 2004) , we also hypothesized that maternal symptoms would mediate the relations between risk factors and children's behavior problems. We focused on demographic risk factors found in prior studies to be related to child functioning and examined relationships separately for internalizing and externalizing problems.\nWe also examined the potential protective role of the mothers' partners for children's behavioral adjustment. Specifically, we tested the buffering effect of mother-reported partner child care involvement on children's behavior in the face of maternal depressive symptoms. In contrast to prior studies that used global indices of partner involvement, we focused on care provided directly to the child by using a rich, multi-item measure of mother-reported partner involvement in three key aspects of child care: didactic interactions, physical play, and caregiving (Cabrera et al., 2004; Lamb, Pleck, Charnov, & Levine, 1987) . To better capture the unique influence of child care, we examined the role of mother-reported partner child care while controlling for mothers' perceptions of social support from partners. Research indicates that perceived partner social support relates to psychological adjustment in young Latina mothers (Contreras, L\u00f3pez, et al., 1999; Castellanos et al., 2008) and, thus, may influence child behavior indirectly through the effects of that support on maternal adjustment. Partner-provided resources may also influence child behavior by affecting the child-rearing context (Cabrera et al., 2004) . As such, our measure of perceived partner social support included five different types of support (e.g., emotional, tangible) provided by partners. Based on the evidence reviewed in the preceding section, we predicted that mother-reported partner child care would act as a buffer for child internalizing problems in the face of maternal depressive symptoms. The evidence for the buffering effect for externalizing problems is more mixed; therefore, we had no specific prediction regarding this child variable.\nFinally, given that little is known about the characteristics and involvement level of partners of Latina adolescent mothers, we provide a description of the partners in our sample and examined partner and maternal characteristics related to level of mother-reported partner child care involvement. For these and all other study variables, we relied on maternal report (partners did not participate in the study). Although most prior studies also used maternal report, the present results should be interpreted in light of this methodology."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Participants for the current study (N = 125) were drawn from a larger sample (N = 170) of young Latina mothers and their children. The current sample of 125 participants is comprised of all mothers from the larger sample who reported having a romantic partner at the time of interview (73.5%). Chi-square and t tests indicated that mothers with partners did not differ significantly from those without on key demographic indicators and the main study variables (Grau, 2011) .\nThe mean age of the 125 mothers in the current study was 17.94 years (SD = 1.34, range 14.25-19.92) at the target child's birth. Mothers resided in a low-income neighborhood of a Midwestern city, and they were predominantly of Puerto Rican heritage (82.4%). Approximately 45% of participants were born outside of the U.S. mainland. Children's (54.1% male) mean age was 18.2 months (SD = .95). The majority (84%) were the first child, and 71.2% were the only child. Most mothers (70%) described their children as being purely Latino, whereas the other children were reported as mixed.

Most participants (78.2%) were recruited in waiting rooms of pediatric clinics serving Latino neighborhoods in a Midwestern city. The remaining participants were referred either by friends/relatives or self (15.3%) or by service providers (6.5%). Mothers were contacted to participate in the study regardless of child's age. At this point, we established eligibility (i.e., mother 19 years or younger at child's birth, child under 20 months, child without major physical/medical problems at birth) and obtained contact information from mothers who agreed to be contacted for participation when their children reached eligible age. In all, 253 eligible individuals were contacted; 12 (4.7%) of these did not agree to be considered for the study. The remaining 241 mothers were then followed until their child met age criteria (18 \u00b1 2 months). Of these, 170 participated (70.5%). Of the families, 71 were lost to follow-up because they moved away before the children reached eligible age (18.5%), could not be located (28%), refused to participate when contacted again (8.5%), or had scheduling problems that prevented participation while their children met the age criteria (45%).\nTwo female researchers conducted home visits in either English or Spanish (3 hrs on average). Informed consent was obtained from participants (and a parent/guardian, if minors) prior to data collection. Mothers were videotaped interacting with their children and interviewed in their preferred language (70.6% English and 29.4% Spanish). Interviews were conducted by using a computer-assisted procedure in which each question was presented on the screen and read aloud by the researcher to control for reading level. Participants were given response cards from which they could choose numbered answers, and the researcher recorded responses. Families were compensated with $70, a small gift for the child, and received a copy of the videotaped mother-child interactions. Only questionnaire data were available for this study."}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": "All measures were available in English and Spanish. We tested the internal consistency of each scale separately for English and Spanish respondents, and all scales showed adequate internal consistency. Table 1 lists means and standard deviations for the main study variables.\nMaternal depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms were measured by using the Depression scale of the Symptom Checklist-90-R (SCL-90-R; Derogatis, 1994), a 13-item self-report scale assessing symptoms in the past 2 weeks. (For example, \"In the past two weeks, how much were you distressed by feeling hopeless about the future?\") Responses range from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Adequate reliability coefficients (\u03b1 = .90) for this scale were found in the normative sample (Derogatis, 1994) and in studies with young Latina mothers (Contreras, L\u00f3pez, et al., 1999; L\u00f3pez & Contreras, 2005) . In our sample, the internal consistency reliability of this scale was .89; and .86 and .91 for English and Spanish respondents, respectively.\nChild behavior. Child internalizing and externalizing problems were measured by using the Internalizing and Externalizing scales of the Child Behavior Checklist 1\u00bd-5 (CBCL 1\u00bd-5; Achenbach & Rescorla, 2000) , a 99-item, parent-report measure assessing child behavior problems. Responses range from 0 (not true) to 2 (very true or often true). Excellent validity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability are reported for these scales (Achenbach & Rescorla, 2000) . In samples of Latino parents, the Spanish and English versions of the scales have demonstrated adequate internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and concurrent validity between language versions (Gross et al., 2006; Weiss, Goebel, Page, Wilson, & Warda, 1999) . In our sample, adequate reliabilities were found both for internalizing problems (\u03b1 = .86) and for externalizing problems (\u03b1 = .86), and for English (internalizing \u03b1 = .85, externalizing \u03b1 = .87) and Spanish (internalizing \u03b1 =.86, externalizing \u03b1 = .84) versions. Sample means were substantially higher than those of the normative sample, and 15.3% and 20.6% of the children fell in the clinically significant range for internalizing and externalizing problems, respectively. Consistent with age norms, no gender differences were found for either scale. To maximize variability, raw scores were used in analyses.\nMother-reported partner child care involvement. Partner child care involvement during the past month was reported by mothers. Eleven items were adapted from measures of father involvement used with samples of adult parents, including Latinos, in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B; Cabrera et al., 2004; Cabrera, Shannon, West, & Brooks-Gunn, 2006) . Items assessed frequency of didactic child care (e.g., sing songs, read stories); physical play (e.g., play with toys, tease child to get him/her to laugh); and caregiving (e.g., help with bath, feeding). Responses ranged from 0 (never) to 6 (several times a day). Scores from all items were averaged, providing an overall score of mother-reported partner child care involvement. Adequate internal consistency was found for the scale (\u03b1 = .87, whole sample, \u03b1 = .88, English, and \u03b1 = .84, Spanish).\nPerceived partner social support. Partner social support was measured by using the Social Support Network Questionnaire (SSNQ; Gee & Rhodes, 2007) . Participants nominated persons they perceived as available to provide emotional, tangible, cognitive guidance, positive feedback, and socializing support. An index of perceived partner support was obtained by totaling the number of support types for which mother's perceived partners to be available. Scores on this index ranged from 0 (partner perceived as unavailable to provide any type of support) to 5 (partner perceived as available to provide every type of support). This scale showed adequate internal consistency (\u03b1 = .87, whole sample, \u03b1 =.89, \n7. Economic strain English, and \u03b1 = .83, Spanish). Previous studies of Latina adolescent mothers found similar reliabilities and adequate validity for this measure (Contreras, L\u00f3pez, et al., 1999; Contreras, Mangelsdorf, Rhodes, Diener, & Brunson, 1999) . Negative life events. These were measured by using a modified version of the Life Events Survey (Sarason, Johnson, & Siegel, 1978) adapted for young minority mothers (Rhodes, Ebert, & Fisher, 1992) . Mothers responded to questions regarding stressful events in the last year. Responses ranged from 1 (extremely negative) to 5 (extremely positive) or 6 (did not occur in the past year). Negative event ratings were totaled and weighted such that events perceived as extremely negative carried more weight than those that were perceived as merely negative. Sarason et al. (1978) found adequate test-retest reliability for this measure, which has also shown relations to psychological adjustment among Latina adolescent mothers ( Contreras, L\u00f3pez, et al., 1999) .\nEconomic strain. This was measured by using the Economic Strain Questionnaire (ESQ; Pearlin, Menaghan, Lieberman, & Mullan, 1981), a 7-item self-report measure of financial difficulties. Participants rated the usual situation in their household by responding to questions like \"Do you feel your household is able to afford decent housing?\" with responses from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Items were recoded such that higher scores reflected more strain and then averaged to create a mean score. In a study with AA adolescent mothers, economic strain related to psychological distress (Rhodes, Ebert, & Meyers, 1994) . Adequate reliability was found in our sample (\u03b1 = .81) and among English and Spanish respondents (\u03b1 = .82 and \u03b1 = .82, respectively)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Overview of Analyses", "text": "Prior to running analyses, all variables were standardized to reduce collinearity.

Longer relationship was significantly related to higher levels of partner child care involvement (r = .27, p = .002), and partners who coresided with the participants had significantly higher mean levels of mother-reported child care involvement than those who did not (t[123, 2] = \u22126.42, p < .001).

Results of both regressions indicated that mother-reported partner child care involvement did not have a direct effect on child behavior, whereas maternal symptoms remained a significant predictor of both types of behavior problems. Specific results for child internalizing problems indicated that the interaction term for mother-reported partner child care and depressive symptoms was significant. To interpret the interaction, we plotted the results such that child internalizing problems is on the y-axis, depressive symptoms on the x-axis, and three levels of perceived partner child care involvement are represented by three different lines (Figure 3) . Following Jaccard and Turrisi (2003) , the regression equation was used to calculate y values at three levels of depressive symptoms (\u22121 SD [low], 0 [medium], and +1 SD [high] ) and three levels of partner child care (\u22121 SD [low], 0 [medium], and +1 SD [high] ).

Further, we sought to uncover a protective factor for the toddlers' behavioral adjustment and found that mother-reported partner child care moderated the relation between depressive symptoms and child internalizing problems, although not externalizing problems.\nRegarding the first hypothesis, we replicated and extended results from the only previous study of entirely Latina adolescent mothers, which found that depressive symptoms related to toddlers' display of less positive affect and more distress during mother-child interactions . Although we used a maternal report measure of child behavior, it presumably reflects mothers' observations of child behavior in a range of circumstances and while interacting with others. Thus, our results suggest that maternal symptomatology is reflected in child behavior more generally rather than solely in the context of mother-child interactions. The results also add to the existent literature documenting relations between maternal depressive symptoms and mother-reported child behavior problems in young mothers from other ethnic groups (Black et al., 2002; Leadbeater & Bishop, 1994; Yoshikawa et al., 2001) . Moreover, our findings suggest that this relation emerges quite early in development-during the second year of life-and that depressive symptoms are related both to internalizing and to externalizing problems in young children.\nImportantly, our findings also indicate that this relation exists above and beyond contextual risk factors faced by these young families. Specifically, maternal life event stress was related to maternal depressive symptoms and child internalizing and externalizing problems. Nonetheless, maternal symptoms contributed uniquely to the prediction of both types of problems. Our analyses also indicated that maternal symptomatology mediated the link between life stress and child problems, supporting our second hypothesis. Regarding child internalizing problems specifically, mediation analyses indicated that maternal depressive symptoms fully mediated the relation between negative life events and child internalizing problems. For externalizing problems, maternal depressive symptoms served as a partial mediator of the link between negative life events and child externalizing problems, and the influence of negative life events remained significant when accounting for the effects of maternal depressive symptoms. Although cross-sectional in nature, these findings are consistent with theories and empirical findings highlighting the role of parental functioning as a mechanism through which environmental stress impacts child functioning (Conger et al., 2002; Parke et al., 2004) . The finding that life events also directly related to externalizing problems suggests that children may be directly impacted by their mothers' negative life events. This is consistent with models of parenting and child development in ethnic minority families (Contreras et al., 2002; Garc\u00eda Coll et al., 1996) that highlight the direct influence of contextual factors on children's characteristics and developmental outcomes.\nIn contrast to results for life events stress, mothers reported relatively low levels of economic strain, and this variable related only marginally to maternal depressive symptoms and child internalizing problems. This is surprising given the socioeconomic conditions of our participants, most of whom relied on public assistance and resided in low-income neighborhoods. Given that the economic strain measure we used partly reflects the subjective experience of the mothers' economic situation, mothers might have perceived themselves as able to cope with economic stress and, therefore, did not experience high levels of economic pressure.\nDespite a lack of research investigating their influence, partners are commonly present in the lives of adolescent Latina mothers and their young children (Contreras, L\u00f3pez, et al., 1999; D. R. Moore et al., 2007; Wasserman et al., 1994) . The results from the current study are consistent with these findings as a substantial majority (73.5%) of the mothers in the larger sample reported being in a romantic relationship. In addition, our participants reported that most (72.8%) of the relationships had lasted longer than 2 years, and the majority (70.4%) of mothers lived with their partners, indicating high levels of partner presence in the lives of our participants' children.\nDue to a lack of prior research, we had no hypotheses about which partner demographic variables would relate to level of child care involvement. Consistent with findings for adult minority fathers (Cabrera et al., 2004) , we found that mothers who coresided and/or maintained longer relationships with their partners reported greater partner involvement in child care. This finding makes sense as these men are likely to have more frequent and more enduring contact with the children. The finding that younger partners were reported to be more highly involved in child care is surprising. A possible explanation could be that younger partners may be less likely to have consistent employment, placing them in the home more often. Thus, they may be relied upon more often by young mothers to provide child care. Post hoc analyses indicated that younger partners were less likely to be employed (r = .21, p = .02), providing some support for this explanation. Maternal demographic variables were not related to their report of partner child care, but mothers with more depressive symptoms and more life event stress reported that their partners provided less child care. Given the high risk faced by this population and the potential for partners to impact child development, future research should continue to investigate factors associated with partners' involvement. Such factors could include relationship quality, culturally derived notions of fathering and gender roles, relationships with family of origin, and partner characteristics such as access to resources or income.\nRegarding the buffering effect, the current study results are consistent with parenting theories suggesting a protective influence of a male caregiver in the face of maternal depression (Belsky, 1984; Goodman & Gotlib, 1999) , as well as with findings from the only previous study of adolescent mothers in this area (Howard et al., 2006) . Using a global composite of father involvement in the family during the first several years of life, Howard and collaborators found a significant buffering effect of father involvement on child internalizing (but not externalizing) problems among 8-to 10-year-olds of mainly AA adolescent mothers. The current study added to the literature by investigating the protective impact of partners on toddlers of Latina adolescent mothers and by providing evidence for the buffering effect even at an early age.\nConsistent with the study by Howard and colleagues (2006) , partner involvement did not act as a buffer for externalizing problems in our sample. Although the reasons for this are unclear, the lack of a significant moderation could be attributed to the somewhat small sample size of our study limiting the statistical power available to detect the effect for children's externalizing problems. Nonetheless, results for internalizing problems clearly suggest that, at relatively higher levels of maternal depressive symptoms, mother-reported partner child care involvement appears to play a protective role for children.\nOur study also attempted to isolate one of the mechanisms through which partners may have an influence. Our measure of involvement assessed specifically the partners' child care behaviors as reported by mothers. Moreover, by controlling for a composite of partner social support, we were able to better capture the role played by the child care interactions of partners. Interestingly, mother-reported partner child care did not relate directly to child behavior, indicating that its protective influence occurs only in the context of higher depressive symptoms. Given the cross-sectional nature of our analyses, it is not clear how the buffering effect occurs. Nonetheless, the results are consistent with the view that higher levels of depressive symptoms may prompt partners to become more involved in child care. At the same time, as depressive symptoms increase, mothers may interact less with their children, which, in turn, increases the level of influence of partners' interactions with the children."}, {"section_title": "Limitations and Future Directions", "text": "Despite adding to the literature in many ways, the current study also has limitations. First, since our sample included primarily Latina mothers of Puerto Rican heritage, our results cannot be generalized to other groups of Latina adolescent mothers or to those of other ethnic backgrounds. Second, we relied solely on maternal report for all variables. Although previous research has often used maternal report, reliance on one reporter may have affected the results and is a limitation of the current study. It is important to note that we controlled for maternal perceptions of partner social support in all analyses with partner child care involvement, mitigating the potential effect of bias in maternal reports. In addition, the interaction effect that we obtained suggests that our findings are not solely the result of shared method variance or to participants displaying response biases. Nonetheless, future studies using observational measures or multiple reporters are needed to replicate our findings.\nThe cross-sectional design of the current study is another limitation because we are unable to draw conclusions about the direction of the relations found. Future research using a prospective design and independent assessments of the constructs are needed to clarify the direction of the associations observed. Future research should also investigate variables that relate to child externalizing problems, specifically. Perhaps aspects of partner involvement not assessed in the current study play an important role in buffering the development of externalizing problems in children. Similarly, in addition to depression, other types of maternal symptomatology are likely to influence child behavior. In fact, research has found elevated levels of externalizing problems among Latina adolescent mothers (Uma\u00f1a-Taylor et al., 2011) . Lastly, given their presence and level of involvement, it would be interesting to examine more broadly the potential influence that partners may have on other aspects of child functioning and development.\nOur findings have implications for treatment and prevention efforts. First, given the strong association observed between maternal depressive symptoms and young children's emotional and behavior problems, early detection and treatment of depression are clearly indicated. In addition, interventions aimed at increasing the adolescents' resources, their ability to cope with life stress, and their parenting skills may lower their stress and negative affect, enhance their effectiveness with children and, in turn, have a positive influence on the emotional and behavioral adjustment of their children. These efforts should also include partners in order to guide them in appropriate child care behaviors and facilitate successful coparenting.\nIn sum, consistent with prior literature based primarily on adult mothers and adolescent mothers from other ethnic groups, the current study documented a significant relation between maternal depressive symptoms and child emotional and behavioral problems in young Latino families. Further, maternal symptoms partially mediated the relation between the life event stress experienced by mothers and their children's functioning. Also, mother-reported partner child care involvement emerged as a protective factor by buffering children's internalizing problems at higher levels of maternal depressive symptoms. Given the young age of the children in our study, the findings argue for the critical need for prevention and early assessment of maternal depressive symptoms and child behavior problems in this at-risk minority population."}]
