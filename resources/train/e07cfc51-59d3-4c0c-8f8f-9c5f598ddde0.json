[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Here we leverage the unique characteristics of the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network and ultrasensitive immunoassay technology to demonstrate that NfL levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (n = 187) and serum (n = 405) are correlated with one another and are elevated at the presymptomatic stages of familial Alzheimer's disease. Longitudinal, within-person analysis of serum NfL dynamics (n = 196) confirmed this elevation and further revealed that the rate of change of serum NfL could discriminate mutation carriers from non-mutation carriers almost a decade earlier than cross-sectional absolute NfL levels (that is, 16.2 versus 6.8 years before the estimated symptom onset). Serum NfL rate of change peaked in participants converting from the presymptomatic to the symptomatic stage and was associated with cortical thinning assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, but less so with amyloid-\u03b2 deposition or glucose metabolism (assessed by positron emission tomography). Serum NfL was predictive for both the rate of cortical thinning and cognitive changes assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination and Logical Memory test. Thus, NfL dynamics in serum predict disease progression and brain neurodegeneration at the early presymptomatic stages of familial Alzheimer's disease, which supports its potential utility as a clinically useful biomarker.\nIn most neurodegenerative diseases, brain changes manifest many years before clinical symptoms become apparent. In Alzheimer's disease, presymptomatic changes in the brain include cortical thinning and neuropathological depositions containing amyloid-\u03b2 and tau. These pathological changes can be assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron-emission tomography (PET), and measurement of amyloid-\u03b2 and tau protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [1] [2] [3] [4] . However, CSF collection is invasive and imaging modalities are expensive; therefore, they are not well suited to routine clinical practice. Blood biomarkers for the presymptomatic phase of Alzheimer's disease are largely lacking, although recent progress in the analysis of amyloid-\u03b2 , tau, and neurofilament light chain (NfL) in the blood have been reported [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . NfL is a component of the axonal cytoskeleton and is primarily expressed in large-caliber myelinated axons 11, 12 . Changes of NfL in bodily fluids have been linked to brain damage and brain atrophy in mouse models and multiple neurological disorders including proteopathic neurodegenerative diseases 11, [13] [14] [15] [16] . Advancements in NfL measurements have revealed tight correlations between NfL in the CSF and blood and have sparked interest in an NfL blood-based biomarker that monitors neurodegeneration and disease progression. \nSerum neurofilament dynamics predicts\n277\nLetters\nHowever, longitudinal analyses are largely missing and the importance of NfL as a molecular biomarker for the presymptomatic phase of neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear 6, 9, 17 . We made use of the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) 18 data and biospecimens to study NfL changes in the CSF and blood of presymptomatic and symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. DIAN participants are members of families carrying highly penetrant autosomal-dominant mutations in the genes encoding the amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) or presenilin 1 (PSEN1) or 2 (PSEN2)\n. Family members who do not carry the mutations serve as controls. Since the age of symptom onset tends to be consistent for a given mutation, it is possible to calculate for participants an estimated years to symptom onset (EYO) from the known onset of individuals with the same mutation 20 . We used the single-molecule array immunoassay technology to measure NfL in the CSF and blood serum of DIAN participants at their baseline (initial) visit (mutation carriers, n = 243; non-carriers, n = 162) (see Supplementary Table 1 for participant characteristics). Multivariate linear mixed effects models (LMEMs) served to assess the earliest point in the disease when NfL starts to increase in mutation carriers in relation to non-carriers (Fig. 1a,b) . Results revealed that NfL in the CSF was significantly increased between mutation carriers and non-carriers at \u2212 6.8 EYO (Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 1a ). Almost identically, serum NfL was also increased at \u2212 6.8 EYO ( Fig. 1b; Extended Data Fig. 1b) . Consistent with our earlier work 13 CSF and serum NfL levels were tightly associated (Fig. 1c,d ). No differences in CSF or serum NfL levels between the three familial Alzheimer's disease mutations were found (Extended Data Fig. 2) .\nGiven the strong association between serum and CSF NfL, and the obvious advantage of a non-invasive disease blood biomarker 21 , we chose to focus on serum NfL for subsequent longitudinal analyses. From the 405 participants with baseline serum, 196 returned for at least 1 and maximally 5 follow-up visits, with a mean number of 2.5 visits and a median observation time of 3 years from the baseline visit (see Supplementary Table 2 for the longitudinal characteristics of participants).\nOverall, the longitudinal analysis of serum NfL confirmed the cross-sectional findings (Fig. 2a) . Using LMEMs we calculated the \nLetters Nature MediciNe slope of NfL change per year for each participant. As with crosssectional values, the NfL rates of change were significantly elevated in mutation carriers relative to non-carriers. Strikingly, however, the first EYO point where this increase became significant was at \u2212 16.2 years ( Fig. 2b ; see also Extended Data Fig. 3) , which is almost a decade earlier than the cross-sectional baseline estimates (\u2212 6.8 EYO, see earlier). Consistent with this earlier separation of mutation carriers and non-carriers using longitudinal measurements, the rate of change could distinguish presymptomatic mutation carriers from non-carriers more accurately compared to baseline serum NfL using receiver operating characteristics analysis (Extended Data Fig. 4) . Next, we subdivided mutation carriers into three groups: presymptomatic mutation carriers (individuals who scored 0 on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale across all visits); converters (CDR = 0 at baseline and CDR > 0 at subsequent visits); and symptomatic mutation carriers (CDR > 0 across all visits). Then we compared the rate of change in serum NfL across these groups. Analyses The displayed x axis range is limited to \u2212 27.5 until + 12.5 years before or after EYO, respectively, to maintain blinding of some individuals contributing to this dataset. In addition, again to maintain blinding, the EYO of two participants (one mutation carrier and one non-carrier) was set to the mean of both EYO values. A logarithmic version of the spaghetti plot is shown in Extended Data Fig. 3a to better appreciate that changes between mutation carriers and non-carriers already occur at presymptomatic levels. b, Estimated rate of change per year in serum NfL (see Methods for calculation) plotted against baseline EYO for mutation carriers and non-carriers (shown is \u2212 27.5 until + 12.5 years). Individual random effect slope estimates are plotted as colored symbols. The shaded areas represent the 99% credible intervals around the model estimates. The curves and credible intervals are drawn from the actual distributions of model fits derived with the Hamiltonian Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses. The first EYO where groups (non-carriers and mutation carriers) differed was determined to be the first point where the 99% credible intervals around the difference distribution between non-carriers and mutation carriers did not overlap 0 (\u2212 16.2 years before EYO; see Extended Data Fig. 3b ). An even earlier deviation of the two curves was calculated when linear regression analyses were performed (Extended Data Fig. 3c ). c, Rate of change per year in serum NfL across four groups differing by mutation and cognitive status: non-carriers (blue, n = 63); presymptomatic (Presym) mutation carriers (yellow, n = 65) are individuals who scored as CDR = 0 across all visits; converters (orange, n = 13) are mutation carriers who scored as CDR = 0 at baseline and CDR > 0 at subsequent visits; symptomatic (Sym) mutation carriers (red, n = 55) are individuals who scored as CDR > 0 across all visits. The boxes map to the median, 25th and 75th quintiles, and the whiskers extend to 1.5 \u00d7 interquartile range (IQR). Comparisons were done with LMEMs. Presymptomatic mutation carriers had a significantly higher annual rate of change compared to non-carriers (B(s.e.m.) = 0.009(0.003), P = 6.71 \u00d7 10 \u22124\n). Converters had significantly higher rate of change compared to both non-carriers (B(s.e.m.) = 0.024(0.004), P = 3.05 \u00d7 10 \u22127\n) and presymptomatic mutation carriers (B(s.e.m.) = 0.015(0.005), P = 1.19 \u00d7 10\n). Symptomatic mutation carriers had significantly higher rates of change compared to both non-carriers (B(s.e.m.) = 0.020(0.003), P = 8.78 \u00d7 10 revealed that the rate of change in serum NfL peaked in the converter group with no further increase in the symptomatic carriers (Fig. 2c) . Interestingly, flattening or even U-shaped curves have also been observed in longitudinal studies for CSF biomarkers in dominant and sporadic AD 22, 23 . No differences in NfL rate of change were found between mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 (Extended Data Fig. 5a ). To analyze whether the NfL rate of change was associated with the aggressiveness of individual mutations or EYO, we analyzed how far away the NfL rate of change of each mutation carrier was from the median value from the model estimates at that individual's EYO (Extended Data Fig. 5b ). Although we did not find any significant differences, it is possible that differences become apparent when the number of individuals and longitudinal data points increase.\nTo study if brain changes are coupled with changes in serum NfL, regression analysis between NfL rates of change and rates of change in brain imaging modalities were performed. We focused on the precuneus since previous analyses have shown this area to be most sensitive to Alzheimer's disease progression 2, 24 . NfL rates of change in serum and rates of precuneus cortical thinning were significantly associated in symptomatic mutation carriers with a trend toward significance in presymptomatic mutation carriers (Fig. 3a) . The rate of change in serum NfL and the rate of change in precuneus glucose metabolism ( 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18 F-FDG) PET) were significantly associated in symptomatic mutation carriers but not in presymptomatic mutation carriers (Fig. 3b) . Although there was a positive relationship between NfL rate of change and the rate of change in precuneus amyloid-\u03b2 deposition (amyloid-\u03b2 -PET), the association did not reach significance (Fig. 3c) . These results indicate that NfL changes in the blood most closely reflect cortical thinning and support the view that serum NfL is primarily a marker of neurodegeneration.\nTo examine the utility of serum NfL for predicting subsequent neurodegeneration and clinical symptoms, we performed a (retrospective) pseudo-predictive analysis to ask whether baseline serum NfL levels were predictive of subsequent cortical thinning (Fig. 4a) . In addition, we assessed the predictability of baseline serum NfL for detecting change in two cognitive parameters, namely the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Logical Memory test (Fig. 4b,c) . Indeed, baseline NfL was highly predictive of future annualized cortical thinning, for both presymptomatic and symptomatic mutation carriers, at subsequent visits (Fig. 4a) and was also predicative for a decrease in MMSE and Logical Memory scores (Fig. 4b,c) .\nTo examine whether serum NfL is also predictive in a truly prospective design, the first 39 mutation carriers returning for followup visits after the last serum collection were included in the analysis. (The median time between last serum collection and subsequent visit was 2.1 years.) This prospective analysis allowed us to use the serum NfL rate of change for the prediction of further cortical thinning and cognitive changes (from the last visit with serum collection to the follow-up visit). Despite the small sample size, significant (predictive) associations were found between serum NfL rate of change and cortical thinning as well as MMSE and Logical Memory test (Fig. 4d-f) .\nCross-sectional and longitudinal data analyses of DIAN and other large Alzheimer's disease cohorts have demonstrated that the pathological processes in Alzheimer's disease begin more than two decades before the onset of clinical symptoms. The accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 in the brain (estimated 15-20 years before clinical onset) is followed by declines in cortical metabolism (estimated 10-15 years before clinical onset) and brain atrophy (5-10 years before clinical onset) 1,2,22,25\n. Thus, it is generally agreed that therapeutic . The present results suggest that NfL levels in the blood may serve as such a biomarker to monitor neurodegeneration and disease progression already in presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease.\nThe strong association between NfL levels in the CSF and blood indicates that NfL changes in the blood reflect changes in the brain, a finding also reported for other neurodegenerative diseases including sporadic Alzheimer's disease 6, 13, 27, 28 . In the present study serum was analyzed but similar levels and tight correlations have also been reported for NfL in the plasma 13, 27 . The antigen detected with the (ultrasensitive) immunoassay used in this study is presumably a short and stable fragment (~10 kD) of the core domain of NfL 15, 29 . Such a stable fragment appears well suited as a blood biomarker for monitoring a slow neurodegenerative process in the brain.\nUsing serial NfL measurements we found that the NfL annual rate of change can distinguish non-carriers and mutation carriers as early as 16 years before the estimated symptom onset. This is almost a decade earlier than when using absolute NfL levels measured at a single time point. Consistently, previous studies reported only non-significant or barely significant increases in absolute NfL in the blood in presymptomatic or even mildly cognitive impaired Alzheimer's disease patients 6, 9, 13 . In symptomatic Alzheimer's disease, our results suggest that the NfL rate of change reaches a plateau, whereas absolute NfL levels continue to increase. Increased absolute NfL levels in the blood in the symptomatic disease phase is consistent with similar observations in progressive supranuclear palsy The very early changes of NfL in the blood may appear surprising in light of the reported overall brain atrophy only 5-10 years before symptom onset. However, atrophy of individual cortical regions occurs earlier 1, 2, 22, 25 . In fact, precuneus thinning was also detected around 16 years before symptom onset 2 , suggesting that NfL changes are sensitive enough to pick up such early regional ) were run with all mutation carriers together (n = 125) because of the high degree of overlap in cognitive and biomarker levels between presymptomatic (Presym) and symptomatic (Sym) mutation carriers. However, at least for cortical thickness, separate analyses for presymptomatic and symptomatic mutation carriers were also significant (n = 65, presymptomatic mutation carriers (yellow): B(s.e.m.) = \u2212 0.03(0.01), P = 0.047; n = 60, symptomatic mutation carriers (red): B(s.e.m.) = \u2212 0.10(0.03), P = 0.002). d-f, In a true prospective design, mutation carriers returning for follow-up visits after the last serum collection were included in the analysis.

The same predictive associations were also significant for the MMSE (e; n = 37; B(s.e.m.) = \u2212 52.23(20.19), P = 0.015) and Logical Memory test scores (f; immediate recall, n = 37; B(s.e.m.) = \u2212 75.91(18.07), P = 0.0002). For descriptive purposes, presymptomatic and symptomatic mutation carriers are plotted in yellow and red, respectively. Note that not all participants with baseline NfL measurements had longitudinal MRI imaging and longitudinal cognitive parameters available; thus, sample sizes (n) in a-c are slightly lower than those in Supplementary Table 2.

The association between NfL and cortical thinning, rather than amyloid-\u03b2 deposition, is in line with cerebral amyloid-\u03b2 aggregation being a trigger of subsequent neurodegeneration that, however, become independent of each other at later disease stages 31 . The relationship of NfL to tau in bodily fluids needs further work. In the DIAN cohort, the increase of tau in the CSF (absolute levels, cross-sectional) occurs as early as 15 years before the estimated age of symptom onset 32 , which is much earlier than the increase of baseline NfL in the CSF.\nWhile an increase of NfL levels is not specific for Alzheimer's disease, the present findings are relevant for understanding Alzheimer's disease progression and highlight their utility as a marker in clinical trials. In presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease, the greater the NfL rate of change, the closer an individual is to converting to symptomatic Alzheimer's disease, a finding also reported for cortical atrophy 2, 33 . This suggests that longitudinal measures of NfL in the serum are a reliable, relatively cheap, and fast readout of neurodegeneration in the brain with comparable diagnostic value to neuroimaging but without the regional resolution.\nAlthough our prospective predication analysis was not adequately powered to demonstrate that NfL rate of change is indeed a better predictor of disease progression (neurodegeneration and cognitive decline) than absolute NfL values, our observations suggest that this is the case in presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease, while absolute NfL levels are better predictors in the symptomatic phase. Absolute NfL levels have been successfully used to predict brain volume changes in (symptomatic) multiple sclerosis 14 and clinical outcome in traumatic brain injury 34 . In a recent study with Huntington's disease patients, NfL blood levels were predictive of disease onset within three years 30 , but NfL rate of change was not assessed. The current study design with the 2-3 years interval between participant assessments did not allow us to determine the relationship between the time over which the NfL rate of change was calculated and its clinical predictability. However, the latter appears important to advance the NfL rate of change as a biomarker. Future analyses should also assess more accurately the disease period at which the NfL rate of change is a better predictor of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline than absolute NfL. Finally, it is important to translate our findings to sporadic Alzheimer's disease and other cerebral proteopathies 13, 35 . Studies have indicated that the pathogenesis of familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease are very similar and share similar pathophysiology and progression [36] [37] [38] [39] . However, sporadic Alzheimer's disease patients are typically older and have more comorbidities, which in turn may influence NfL levels in the blood. The latter is however a further argument that absolute NfL levels may be less useful for prediction in early disease stages compared to the NfL rate of change.\n"}, {"section_title": "Nature MediciNe", "text": "However, longitudinal analyses are largely missing and the importance of NfL as a molecular biomarker for the presymptomatic phase of neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear 6, 9, 17 .

The rate of change in serum NfL and the rate of change in precuneus glucose metabolism ( 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18 F-FDG) PET) were significantly associated in symptomatic mutation carriers but not in presymptomatic mutation carriers (Fig. 3b) . Although there was a positive relationship between NfL rate of change and the rate of change in precuneus amyloid-\u03b2 deposition (amyloid-\u03b2 -PET), the association did not reach significance (Fig. 3c) . These results indicate that NfL changes in the blood most closely reflect cortical thinning and support the view that serum NfL is primarily a marker of neurodegeneration.\nTo examine the utility of serum NfL for predicting subsequent neurodegeneration and clinical symptoms, we performed a (retrospective) pseudo-predictive analysis to ask whether baseline serum NfL levels were predictive of subsequent cortical thinning (Fig. 4a ). In addition, we assessed the predictability of baseline serum NfL for detecting change in two cognitive parameters, namely the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Logical Memory test (Fig. 4b,c) . Indeed, baseline NfL was highly predictive of future annualized cortical thinning, for both presymptomatic and symptomatic mutation carriers, at subsequent visits ( Fig. 4a ) and was also predicative for a decrease in MMSE and Logical Memory scores (Fig. 4b,c) .\nTo examine whether serum NfL is also predictive in a truly prospective design, the first 39 mutation carriers returning for followup visits after the last serum collection were included in the analysis. (The median time between last serum collection and subsequent visit was 2.1 years.) This prospective analysis allowed us to use the serum NfL rate of change for the prediction of further cortical thinning and cognitive changes (from the last visit with serum collection to the follow-up visit). Despite the small sample size, significant (predictive) associations were found between serum NfL rate of change and cortical thinning as well as MMSE and Logical Memory test ( Fig. 4d-f ).\nCross-sectional and longitudinal data analyses of DIAN and other large Alzheimer's disease cohorts have demonstrated that the pathological processes in Alzheimer's disease begin more than two decades before the onset of clinical symptoms. The accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 in the brain (estimated 15-20 years before clinical onset) is followed by declines in cortical metabolism (estimated 10-15 years before clinical onset) and brain atrophy (5-10 years before clinical onset) 1, 2, 22, 25 . Thus, it is generally agreed that therapeutic \nTo determine whether the extracted rate of change in serum NfL was significantly different across mutation status and cognitive status we categorized mutation carriers based on cognitive status, where presymptomatic mutation carriers were individuals who scored as CDR = 0 across all visits (n = 65), converters were mutation carriers who scored as CDR = 0 at baseline and CDR > 0 at subsequent visits (n = 13), and symptomatic mutation carriers were individuals who scored as CDR > 0 across all visits (n = 55). We used LMEMs, including a random intercept for family and fixed effects for baseline age, sex, and group (that is, non-carriers, presymptomatic mutation carriers, converters, or symptomatic mutation carriers), where group was the term of interest, and the extracted rate of change in serum NfL was the dependent variable. Models were computed using lme4 in R. See also Supplementary statistical analysis.\nAssociation between expected age of onset and deviation from the EYO-adjusted median rate of change in NfL. We tested the hypothesis of whether individuals who have an earlier expected age of onset (for example, age of onset of 30 years old versus 55 years old) have an accelerated NfL rate of change. First, to determine if a participant deviated from its expected NfL rate of change, given its baseline EYO, we calculated the median rate of change in NfL at each EYO, generated from model estimates (for the calculation, see 'Baseline CSF and serum NfL and longitudinal NfL as a function of EYO' in the Supplementary statistical analysis; for the depiction of median values, see the red line in Fig. 2b) . We then took each participant's extracted NfL rate of change and subtracted the median value corresponding to its baseline EYO. This resulting value represented the deviation from the expected value, whereby a positive value on this deviation measure indicates that an individual has a higher rate of change in serum NfL (that is, worse) than would be expected given their EYO. Conversely, a negative value on this deviation measure indicates that an individual has a lower rate of change in serum NfL (that is, better) than would be expected given their EYO. Next, to investigate if there was a relationship between individuals with the higher deviation measure and earlier expected age of onset, we grouped individuals by their expected age of onset (determined by their specific mutation type, grouped as age of onset 20-39, 40-49, 50-59, and 60+ ). See also Supplementary statistical analysis.\nRelating NfL rate of change to imaging rate of change. The longitudinal relationship between the rate of change in serum NfL and concurrent rate of change in cortical thickness, metabolism, or amyloid-\u03b2 accumulation was determined within each group of interest (that is, non-carriers, presymptomatic mutation carriers, and symptomatic mutation carriers). Therefore, separate models were run for each non-carrier, presymptomatic mutation carrier, and symptomatic mutation carrier groups. The dependent term for each model was an imaging biomarker with fixed effect terms for baseline age, sex, time from baseline, extracted rate of change in serum NfL, and interaction between time from baseline and rate of change in serum NfL. Models contained random slope and intercept terms for participants and random intercepts for family. The primary term of interest was the interaction between the rate of change in serum NfL and the time from baseline term. Models were fitted using lme4 in R.\nTo determine whether the relationship between groups was different, a model for each imaging modality containing all groups was run. Each model was fitted containing fixed effect terms for baseline age, sex, time from baseline, extracted rate of change in serum NfL, group (non-carriers, presymptomatic mutation carriers, or symptomatic mutation carriers), and two-and three-way interaction between time from baseline, rate of change in serum NfL, and group. Converters were included as part of the symptomatic mutation carrier group. The models also included random slope and intercept terms for the participants and random intercepts for family. The dependent variables were the longitudinal measures for cortical thickness, glucose metabolism, or amyloid-\u03b2 deposition in the precuneus ROI. See also Supplementary statistical analysis."}, {"section_title": "\u22124", "text": "). Converters had significantly higher rate of change compared to both non-carriers (B(s.e.m.) = 0.024(0.004), P = 3.05 \u00d7 10\n) and presymptomatic mutation carriers (B(s.e.m.) = 0.015(0.005), P = 1.19 \u00d7 10"}, {"section_title": "\u22123", "text": "). Symptomatic mutation carriers had significantly higher rates of change compared to both non-carriers (B(s.e.m.) = 0.020(0.003), P = 8.78 \u00d7 10 ). There was no difference between converters and symptomatic mutation carriers (B(s.e.m.) = \u2212 0.004(0.005), P = 0.445)."}, {"section_title": "Online content", "text": "Any methods, additional references, Nature Research reporting summaries, source data, statements of data availability and associated accession codes are available at https://doi.org/10.1038/ s41591-018-0304-3. 18 . DIAN participants are assessed at baseline and subsequent follow-up visits (annually to every third year). Assessment included collection of body fluids (CSF, blood), clinical testing (CDR), neuropsychological testing (including MMSE (raw scores) and the Logical Memory subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (story A), raw scores for immediate and delayed recall), and imaging modalities (MRI, PET with Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB-PET), and 18 F-FDG) as described in earlier publications 1, 2, [40] [41] [42] . The institutional review board at Washington University in St. Louis provided supervisory review and human studies approval. Participants or their caregivers provided informed consent in accordance with their local institutional review boards. NfL analysis in the DIAN cohort was approved by the ethics committee at the medical faculty of the University of T\u00fcbingen, Germany (project number 718/2014BO2). The detailed number of participants (mutation carriers, non-carriers) for baseline and longitudinal measurements are given in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 Clinical assessment and EYO. The presence of dementia (symptoms) was assessed using the CDR 41 . Clinical evaluators were blinded to each participant's mutation status. For every visit a participant's EYO was calculated based on the participant's age at the visit relative to their 'mutation-specific' expected age at dementia onset. The mutation-specific expected age of dementia onset was computed by averaging the reported age of dementia onset across individuals with the same specific mutation 20 . If the mutation-specific expected age at dementia onset was unknown, the EYO was calculated from the age at which parental cognitive decline began. The parental age of clinical symptom onset was determined by a semi-structured interview with the use of all available historical data. The EYO was calculated identically for both mutation carriers and non-carriers. Mutation status was determined using PCR-based amplification of the appropriate exon followed by Sanger sequencing 1 .\nNfL measurements in the CSF and blood. Fluids were collected in the morning under fasting conditions by venipuncture using a 21 gauge (G) butterfly needle and red top plain Vacutainer tubes (Becton, Dickinson and Company). After blood collection the tubes were left upside at room temperature for 30 min to allow clotting. After clotting, tubes were centrifuged at 2,000g for 15 min at room temperature. Serum was taken with a disposable, non-sterile transfer pipette into a single transfer tube (SARSTEDT AG & Co. KG) and immediately frozen on dry ice. After venipuncture, CSF was collected by gravity drip into two 13 ml polypropylene tubes using standard lumbar puncture procedures (L4-L5) with an atraumatic Sprotte spinal needle (22 G). As with serum, CSF was flash-frozen upright on dry ice. Samples collected in the United States were shipped overnight on dry ice to the DIAN biomarker core laboratory at Washington University, whereas samples collected at non-United States sites were stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C and shipped quarterly on dry ice to Washington University. At the core laboratory the frozen samples were subsequently thawed, combined into a single polypropylene tube of serum or CSF, and aliquoted (300 or 500 \u03bc l) into polypropylene Corning microcentrifuge tubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific), after which they were again flash-frozen on dry ice and stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C. For the current study, all available DIAN serum samples (data freeze 11) were shipped to the DIAN site in T\u00fcbingen. CSF samples (data freeze 9) were shipped to the DIAN site in Munich first and used for another analysis before being shipped to the DIAN site in T\u00fcbingen. Thus, CSF samples had one additional freeze-thaw cycle in Munich; however, prior work has indicated no significant effect of up to four freeze-thaw cycles on NfL in CSF 43 . CSF and serum NfL measurements were performed using a highly sensitive single-molecule array assay using the capture monoclonal antibody 47:3 and the biotinylated detection antibody 2:1 (UmanDiagnostics AB) 44 . The samples were measured in duplicate on a Simoa HD-1 platform (Quanterix) using a two-step neat assay. Serum samples were measured at 1:4 and CSF at 1:10 dilution (Trisbuffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, 1% non-fat milk powder, HeteroBlock (300 ug ml\nOmega Biologicals)). Batch-prepared calibrators (bovine lyophilized NfL) ranging from 0 to 10,000 pg ml \u22121 were stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C (Uman Diagnostics AB). All samples were measured blinded. For serum, the mean intra-assay coefficient of variation of duplicate determinations for concentration was 4.2%. In the CSF, the mean intra-assay coefficient of variation was 3.7%. Inter-assay variability was evaluated with three native serum samples and three native CSF samples. The inter-assay coefficients of variation for serum were 7.7% (mean concentration 13.3 pg ml \u22121 ), 2.9% (30.9 pg ml \u22121 ), and 3.7% (269.9 pg ml \u22121 ). In the CSF, the interassay coefficients of variation were 2.4% (445. 4 , we focused our analyses on this region a priori.\nAmyloid-\u03b2 -PET imaging was done using a bolus injection of \u00b9\u00b9C-PiB. Acquisition consisted of a 70-min scan starting at injection or a 30-min scan beginning 40 min after injection. Data in the common 40-70 min time frame were converted to regional standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) relative to the cerebellar gray matter using FreeSurfer-derived ROIs (PET Unified Pipeline, https://github.com/ysu001/PUP). Metabolic imaging was done with 18 F-FDG PET with a 30 min dynamic acquisition beginning 30 min after injection. Data from the 40-60 min time frame were converted to SUVRs relative to cerebellar gray matter. The ADNI Imaging Core verified that the PET images were acquired using the established protocol and free of substantial artifacts. All PET data were partial volume-corrected using a regional spread function technique. Scanner-specific spatial filters were applied to achieve a common resolution (8 mm) across PET scanners. MRI and PET data acquisition and processing has been described in detail in previous studies 1, 2, 24 . Again, for the present analyses, we averaged SUVR values from the bilateral precuneus ROIs defined on the MRI."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis.", "text": "Relating baseline CSF and serum NfL.

Model parameters were estimated using an open source package for Hamiltonian Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses, Stan (http://mc-stan.org/) 45, 46 , implemented using R. This resampling approach leads to a distribution of parameter estimates across iterations. From this distribution it is possible to estimate the 99% credible intervals of the model fits at every EYO for non-carriers, mutation carriers, and the distribution of the difference between non-carriers and mutation carriers. The first EYO where groups (non-carriers and mutation carriers) differed was determined to be the first point where the 99% credible intervals around the differences distribution between non-carriers and mutation carriers did not overlap 0.

Longitudinal data was modeled using LMEMs. LMEMs are a powerful approach to account for the covariance structure introduced by serial measurements and are ideal to deal with imperfect timing or an unbalanced number of data points.

Twenty-eight individuals completed additional imaging and neuropsychological testing, 9 completed only additional neuropsychological testing but no MRI, and 2 who completed an additional MRI but not neuropsychological testing. To determine the rate of change in cortical thickness and cognition (MMSE, Logical Memory test) between the imaging and cognitive assessment concurrent to the participant's last blood draw and follow-up session, we fitted an LMEM for each participant, where the dependent variable was the imaging or cognitive variable of interest at last serum visit and follow-up visit and the independent variable was the time between visits.

Tables 1 and 2 were conducted using the JMP software, version 13.0 (SAS Institute Inc.). For the analysis of Extended Data Fig. 3c a regression model was created, which approximates the changes of non-carriers and mutation carriers. The model uses the rate of change of log serum NfL over EYO. For non-carriers a slightly increasing line over the entire time period was created representing the NfL increase over age. For mutation carriers the same development was taken for the very early years until a bifurcation point indicating the divergence of non-carriers and mutation carriers. From this point on, mutation carriers were shown with a rising slope up to a break of slope, when the line came to a parallel increase as noncarriers. This model uses one common slope at the very beginning, one bifurcation point, and one shift leading to two parallel slopes after symptom onset. See also Supplementary statistical analysis.
