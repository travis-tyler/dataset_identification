These studies typically use a variety of techniques to estimate the ability of the marsh surface to keep up with changing sea levels, and involve historical analyses involving radioactive materials or stable isotopes (Chmura and Aharon, 1995;DeLaune et al., 1983a;Kearney, 1996), measurements of thickness of substrate, placing markers on the surface and measuring deposition at the point where the marker is placed over some period of time. These efforts have been critically important in developing an understanding of how marshes function. However, they cannot, by themselves, adequately address the underlying question of what is happening to coastal marshes and why. It is often difficult, or impossible, to relate findings at one location to other locations in the same marsh, much less locations in distant marshes. In addition, the methods tend to be very time and effort intensive. Turner (1997) notes that the lack of clearly stated hypotheses for testing, quantification and prediction hinders good decision making for management. Further, due to not having carefully stated, testable hypotheses, researchers made diametrically opposed recommendations to the Louisiana government as to what actions would resolve the marsh loss in the Mississippi delta. This dissertation builds on the knowledge gained from earlier studies, looks at factors that may lead to coastal marsh loss and that extend across all marshes, and the considers possibility of quantifying the influence of these factors. In doing so, it proposes five specific hypotheses to test. The purpose of this research is to develop an understanding of the interaction between five factors, which can influence the conversion of coastal marshes to open water. The factors chosen to develop a multivariate spatial model are: 1) distance from the nearest road; 2) distance from the nearest tidal stream; 3) distance upstream from oceanic forcing such as the Atlantic Ocean or a major bay (such as the Chesapeake) where sea level rise could dominate the loss of marshes; 4) distance from the nearest upland; 5) total size of the parcel. These factors were chosen because they affect hydrology and sediment loading to the marsh surface and they, in turn, reflect subtle changes in elevation that are often on the order of a few centimeters. Their selection reflects the underlying assumption that hydrology, sediment supply, and elevation are key factors in marsh loss. These five factors will be discussed in more detail in the next section followed by a more general discussion of the interplay between marsh hydrology, sediment dynamics and marsh loss in Chapter 2. In addition, the factors chosen can all be derived from readily available information such as existing maps and remotely sensed data rather than requiring intensive and time-consuming field techniques that are often point-specific. The specific factors examined in this dissertation reflect current thinking on tidal wetland loss and the value of coastal marshes (Cahoon and Reed, 1995;Kearney, 1996;Orson, 1996;Stevenson and Kearney, 1996;Van der Molen, 1997;Bryant and Chabreck, 1998;Esselink et al., 1998;Evers et al., 1998;Boggs and Shepherd, 1999;Hazelden and Boorman, 1999;Kuhn et al., 1999;Roulet, 2000;Hartig et al., 2002;Morris et al., 2002;Anastasiou and Brooks, 2003;Sun et al., 2003). The value of coastal marshes and factors affecting loss are discussed in Chapter 2. The separate question of the rate of marsh vertical accretion versus sea level rise is not examined directly. However, if a marsh area is accreting at the appropriate rate, it will maintain itself as healthy marsh. If not, it will eventually drown. The expansion of marshes outside the study area is not examined, as areas outside the bounds of the study area are not examined."}, {"section_title": "Hypotheses:", "text": "The probability of a parcel of marsh being open water is directly related to specific landscape and related hydrological factors. This proposition can be rewritten as five specific hypotheses, as shown below. The null hypothesis for each of these specific hypotheses can be simply stated as follows: \"The conversion of marsh surface to open water is a completely stochastic process, and it is not possible to infer that ponds are more or less likely to form in certain places based on this factor.\" The hypotheses for testing the five factors are: Hypothesis 1. The probability of a parcel being completely open water will be negatively related to the distance of the parcel from a road. Hypothesis 2. The probability of a parcel being completely open water will be positively related to the distance the parcel is from the nearest tidal creek or man-made ditch (e.g. mosquito ditches). Hypothesis 3. The probability of a parcel being completely open water will be negatively related to the distance the marsh system containing the parcel is upstream. Hypothesis 4. The probability of a parcel being completely open water will be positively related to the distance of the parcel from the upland. Hypothesis 5: The probability of a parcel being completely open water will be negatively related to the size of the marsh parcel containing the grid cell. These factors will be conditioned by the introduction of tidal range and local relative sea level rise to the model. The detailed rationales underlying the selection of these specific hypotheses are explained in subsequent sections. Hypothesis 1 is that the installation of a paved road across a marsh encourages marsh loss in the vicinity of the road, but outside a buffer zone around the road where marsh stability may actually be enhanced. A road across a marsh may actually increase structural integrity in its immediate vicinity due to installation of materials suitable for road construction. The weight of a road constructed across a marsh may also push the immediately surrounding marsh up (Stevenson, pers. com, 1999). In addition, roads may be built on the most stable part of the marsh and often connect islands within the marsh."}, {"section_title": "Rationales for Selection of Hypotheses", "text": "There are two possible modes of response involved. Structures that prevent flow can limit the supply of inorganic material to the marsh surface. For example, Allen and Rae (1988) found that marshes on opposite sides of a seawall along the Severn River in the U.K. had an average height difference of 1.2 meters, with the section of marsh that was still subjected to tidal flooding being higher. This may be due to drying of the peat on the non-tidal side (Bryant and Chabreck, 1998), resulting in compaction (Bricker-Urso et al., 1989) or lack of inorganic sediment input or both. Stevenson and Kearney (1996) note that building roads across marshes may limit their ability to trap sediment. In the absence of inorganic sediment input, the marsh surface can only accrete vertically via deposition of leaf and stem litter (above ground biomass) and development of rhizome systems (below ground biomass) (Boesch et al., 1994;Stevenson et al., 1988). The inorganic portion of the sediment may be more important as a nutrient than for its actual bulk volume (Bricker-Urso et al., 1989). Bryant and Chabreck (1998) examined the impact of impoundments on marshes in Louisiana. They found that marshes impounded behind levees did not accrete as rapidly as areas of the same marsh outside the impoundments. They attribute this to several factors, principally a lack of inorganic sediment input, but also drying the marsh, which increases the oxidation rate of the organic fraction of the sediment. Where there is an impoundment, they further speculated that the only times the marsh surface would be nourished with mineral sediment was during storm events that overtopped the levees. Floods of this size, however, could easily remove the organic debris that forms much of the bulk of the marsh. In other situations, roads may promote marsh loss through trapping water on one side of the road. If water becomes impounded behind a causeway, the soil will become anoxic and organisms may be subjected to longer periods of higher salinity. Under extremely anoxic conditions sulfate is reduced to toxic sulfide (Kerner, 1993). Stevenson and Kearney (1996) suggest that the formation of oozes with \"negligible structural integrity,\" such as underlie much of Blackwater National Wildlife refuge, may be a result of sulfate reduction and nitrate additions. These oozes contribute to the erodability of the marsh once the root mat is gone. Low plant productivity may be caused by the stress of anaerobic conditions (DeLaune et al., 1983b), which then causes reduced production of biomass. This can be especially problematic when low organic sediment input to the marsh is coupled with the low inorganic sediment input (due to the less effective trapping of mineral sediment from reduced aboveground biomass). On the other hand, some flooding and the resulting anoxic soil conditions may actually improve the vertical accretion rate because organic debris in the oxic layer degrades rapidly and most of the bulk is lost. Degradation of peat under anoxic conditions is much slower than under oxic conditions (Halupa and Howes, 1995)."}, {"section_title": "Hypothesis 2:", "text": "Hypothesis 2 is that formation of ponds will tend to take place away from tidal creeks, man-made ditches and similar sources of sediment-laden overwash. Several studies have plotted regressions of marsh vertical accretion rates vs. distance to nearest tidal creek (Esselink et al., 1998;French and Spencer, 1993;Hatton et al., 1983). All three showed vertical accretion rates are related to proximity to a stream, at least for short distances. This phenomenon reflects the rapid trapping of mineral sediment by the culms of the plants adjacent to tidal creeks, as marsh surfaces are flooded during high tide (see Leonard and Reed, 2000). However, this effect may be confounded by topography, as studies also find topography and vertical accretion rates to be correlated (Esselink et al., 1998;French and Spencer, 1993;Letzsch and Frey, 1980). In a study of a Louisiana salt marsh, Cahoon and Reed (1995) concluded that marsh topography exerted a strong influence on hydroperiod, with areas of lower topographic relief in some areas contributing to dramatic increases in hydroperiod, yielding greater accretion during extended flooding events. Nonethel ess, despite the potential for increased flooding and deposition, the lowest areas of the marsh were found to be deteriorating rapidly, largely due to the fact that the lowest areas are interior marsh areas where limited influx of mineral sediments yields low rates of vertical accretion. Similarly, the development of submerged upland marshes tends to result in marshes with poorly developed tidal creek systems. As the marshes spread inland, areas away from the tidal creeks can actually receive less inorganic sediment, relying solely on peat accumulation for vertical accretion (Stevenson and Kearney, 1996)."}, {"section_title": "Hypothesis 3:", "text": "Hypothesis 3 is that coastal marsh loss is directly related to distance downstream. Coastal marsh loss, in the absence of anthropogenic factors, has been shown to be related to sea level rise , Downs et al., 1994. If this is true, then there should be a trend for downstream marshes (which are closer to both sea level and the sea) to disappear faster than upstream marshes. As sea level rises, the hydroperiod and salinity of lower marshes will change more than those upstream. The plant communities in upstream marshes are more diverse and can still convert to salt-tolerant species. Downstream marshes are already likely to be maximally adapted to salinity and more regular hydroperiods with a few plant species that are already under stress. Therefore, when the salinity and hydroperiod increase, the marsh will be more likely to die (Nyman et al., 1995). In the Great Lakes, where water levels can rise or fall over periods of decades, Keough et al. (1999) report in a review article that, in fact, this progression is what takes place. As the water rises, the more water-adapted species at the water's edge are forced to shift back into the marsh, with subsequent displacement of less water tolerant species. In one study, species distribution in terms of total numbers of species and in the species present changed abruptly going from fresh to oligohaline conditions. The numbers dropped dramatically from 18 species in the freshwater site, to three in oligohaline conditions and five in mesohaline areas (Latham et al., 1991). A preliminary study of four sites along the Patuxent River, MD, (Rogers, unpublished data ) found that species richness was weakly correlated (0.38) with distance upstream from the river mouth. However, the marsh farthest upstream had twice the species richness as the most downstream marsh."}, {"section_title": "Hypothesis 4:", "text": "Hypothesis four is that the probability of a parcel being completely open water will be positively related to the distance of the parcel away from the nearest upland area. Upland should provide several benefits to the marsh immediately adjacent to it. One, of course, is simply elevation: the marsh adjacent to the upland is generally higher than the rest of the marsh farther away since the marsh surface rises in elevation inland. Secondly, if the marsh was formed by deposition onto a substrate as sea level rose over the last few millennia, then the depth of peat will be less near the upland and this may provide more stability to the marsh. In addition, there will be fresh water runoff, which will both provide sediment and reduce the salinity of the adjacent marsh. The logic behind this hypothesis is that near the upland, there will be both a slight elevation change and that the marsh substrate may be shallower with firmer soil underneath near the upland. The distance to the nearest upland was added as a parameter after a brief preliminary study (Rogers unpublished data) looked at 24 plots spread along four transects along the Patuxent River. In this study, four parameters -salinity, soil redox 1 potential, amount of bare soil and the plant species richness -were measured and related to distance upstream and distance from the shore. Six 1-meter-square plots were sampled in pairs along each transect line at 0, 15 and 30 meters from the shore. The plots in each pair were five meters from either side of the transect. The expectation in collecting these was that redox potential would decrease moving from the shore (where there is often a levee) into the interior, which often retains water between tidal cycles. Also, the salinity and percent bare soil were expected to increase along each transect. These expectations were not met, however. Salinity did increase in some cases, but it was not consistent. This may reflect the difference in the sizes of the marsh areas sampled, with some being narrower strips between the adjacent upland and the river. This study also found that redox potential was weakly correlated with distance from the Patuxent River. However, the redox potential was highest near the river shore (perhaps a levee effect due to greater sediment influx), lower 15 meters inland and higher again at 30 meters for the marsh where the distance from shore to upland was shortest. This may indicate that the proximity of the upland helped reduce the soil anoxia by greater aeration due to flushing from the upland gradient of soil/substrate pore water by throughflow. Due to the above observations, distance from the nearest upland was added as a factor to be tested."}, {"section_title": "Hypothesis 5:", "text": "Hypothesis 5 is that marsh loss rates are negatively related to total parcel area. As parcels of a marsh become smaller and smaller, the edge exposed to erosion becomes much greater compared to the amount of marsh that is left to erode. Based on this reasoning, small parcels should disappear faster than large parcels. Conversely, small parcels of marsh may be resistant to loss, because no part of the marsh is far from the sediment input sources. Also, small marshes are likely to be the least erodible areas of a larger marsh that have been left behind and may tend to represent areas that are linked closely to uplands. Only large parcels have enough interior area to develop ponds with sufficient surface area for waves to develop. Similarly, newly-formed channels can help remove sediment more expeditiously from the marsh (DeLaune et al., 1983a), as well as serving as loci for interior pond formation (see Kearney et al., 1988). This hypothesis is distinctly different from the others in several ways. Effects related to size of the parcel are liable (as noted above) to be related to a variety of other effects. This hypothesis was introduced to determine how selection of the size of a marsh parcel in a study affects conclusions about its vulnerability. If there is no size dependency, then studies of small marshes can be applied to large marshes and vice versa. If there is a size dependency, then this has to be considered in making comparisons across marsh size ranges.\nThe probability of a parcel being completely open water will be negatively related to the size of the marsh parcel containing the grid cell."}, {"section_title": "Effects of Scale:", "text": "Measurements of the same property at different scales may yield different causal relationships. For example, local biological dynamics can dominate at small scales, but physical processes tend to dominate at larger scales (Wiens, 1989). Furthermore, quite different effects can explain the same phenomena at different scales. For example, leaf litter decomposition at the local level is explained by the properties of the litter and the decomposers. However, at regional scales, climatic variation accounts for most of the difference (Meentemeyer, 1984). In terrestrial ecosystems, physical factors tend to operate at regional or continental scales, whereas these physical effects are overcome by biological drivers at local scales. However, plant communities can influence climate at regional scales and plant growth can be affected by microtopography and edaphic factors (Wiens, 1989). These effects will be discussed in separate sections below. This principle can be seen to operate in coastal marshes. Plant canopies in experimental flumes affect water velocity and, therefore, deposition and erosion of sediment (Shi et al., 1995). Moreover, they are largely responsible for the organic fraction of the vertical accretionary budget (Kearney et al., 1988). However, ultimately both factors are modulated by sea level rise. On the other hand, two identical inputs can have completely different relationships at different scales (Wiens, 1989). Wiens notes, for example, that Least Flycatcher and American Redstart populations are negatively correlated on local scales, but positively correlated on regional scales. This is presumably because of interspecific competition at small scales, but usage of identical habitats that dominates at regional scales. In addition, Wiens identifies \"grain\" and \"extent\" as limits on scale. The grain is the smallest parcel size that is measured; the extent is the total study area. In this study, the grain size is 28.5 meters and the largest extent is approximately 1000 kilometers. This means that any variation smaller than 28.5 meters is invisible to this project. No tidal creeks smaller than 28.5 meters were used as inputs and small bodies of water were not recorded as such. The formation of small ponds, as long as they do not occupy over 50% of a pixel, is not observed. The trends measured by Rogers (unpublished) in chemistry, species richness, salinity, and bare soil across the marshes would not be visible in this study, although the trends going upstream are visible. In addition, while the impact of large populations of herbivores would be visible, small eat-outs might not be. The overall result of this is that the biotic, inorganic and microtopographic drivers of the beginnings of pond formation cannot be observed at the scale of this study. The five factors proposed for examination as part of the hypothesis would be expected, like the weak, strong, electromagnetic and gravitational forces, to act over different ranges with different strengths. If there is a correlation of loss with size, that would be strictly related to the immediate parcel of marsh. The impact of roads, causeways, levees and similar structures that block water and sediment movement would be expected to be greatest over distances of tens to hundreds of meters. Distance from the nearest tidal creek would be a factor that would operate at most at the scale of a single marsh. The distance of the marsh upstream, on the other hand, would certainly influence the sedimentary dynamics of individual marshes, but as a phenomenon probably is best observed over the length of an entire river system."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 2: Coastal Marshes", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The Value of Coastal Salt Marshes", "text": "Coastal marshes are important for a number of reasons. In brief, marshes are viewed as traps for various pollutants and CO2 (Craft andBroome, 1993, Roulet, 2000) as well as sediment (Hutchinson et al., 1995). Under some circumstances, they can also be sources of sediment (Stevenson et al., 1988;Wang et al., 1993) and nutrients (Childers et al., 1993). The current focus on global carbon cycles makes carbon sequestration an especially important value. As long as coastal marshes maintain themselves with regard to rising sea level, they will continue to sequester carbon, because they have to build substrate. It has been widely believed that detritus from marshes contributes to the estuarine/marine food webs (Odum et al., 1995;Peterson and Howarth, 1987). Wetlands provide habitat for a variety of resident species, both plant and animal, including nursery areas for young fish and shellfish (Browder, 1985;Minello et al., 1994;Rozas, 1995;Schenker and Dean, 1979). Marshes are also critical habitat for many migratory bird species (Daborn et al., 1993;Erwin, 1996, Gabrey et al., 1999."}, {"section_title": "Coastal Salt Marsh Loss Factors", "text": "Coastal salt marshes are often considered to be geologically transient systems (Dame and Childers, 1992) that are sensitive to any changes in hydrology, hydroperiod or salinity (Kuhn et al., 1999;Morris et al., 2002) and are currently being lost ( Figure 1). Some of the factors contributing to this loss are the position of a marsh in the landscape, chemistry, sediment supply, marsh structure, sea level rise, anthropological impacts, fauna, flora, and history. Each of these factors will be discussed below, however, not all of these factors are examined as part this dissertation."}, {"section_title": "Landscape Position", "text": "The position of a marsh in the landscape will determine much about the hydrology, hydroperiod and salinity (Morris et al., 2002). For example, in any one marsh, the high marsh will, by virtue of its slightly higher elevation and distance from the stream channels, have a lower hydroperiod than the areas of the marsh at lower elevation and closer to sea level. The high marsh, however, may have areas subject to very high salinity stresses if tidal water is trapped and evaporates, especially above the MHW mark, because it may be several weeks before another tide comes in and dilutes it back to normal seawater salinity (Frey and Basan, 1985). Deposition rates and tidal range are positively correlated (Letzsch and Frey, 1980;Stevenson et al., 1986) with tidal range affected by several factors, including coastal setting, and local topography."}, {"section_title": "Chemistry", "text": "The chemistry of estuarine intertidal marsh soils has some common characteristics, which distinguish it from other soils. The salinities tend to be high, as do concentrations of sulfide ion, and reducing conditions tend to prevail over oxidizing conditions below the soil surface (Anastasiou and Brooks, 2003). On a local scale, marsh chemistry is strongly influenced by hydroperiod and salinity. Although tidal water can sometimes be trapped in the upper marsh and become highly saline as the water evaporates, the overall incoming tidal water will be lower in salinity farther upstream. Increasing salinity tends to make particulates flocculate and precipitate. This occurs at relatively low salinities, however, so that fresh water coming downstream will have its sediment load stripped relatively far upstream. This causes marshes upstream to have relatively more sediment input than marshes downstream (see Kearney and Ward, 1986), but more at the margins than the interiors. For example, Jug Bay in Maryland has been filling in for over a century (Heinle and Flemer, 1976) as marshes grow from the edges of the bay. Thus, one effect of being at the freshwater-saltwater interface is that marshes will tend to be expanding."}, {"section_title": "Sediment Supply", "text": "Stevenson and Kearney (1996)) suggest that regional variations in sediment supply may be a major factor in marsh loss and survival in the Chesapeake Bay. Marshes of the western shore of the Chesapeake, where sediment influx is undoubtedly higher due to physiography (the Fall Line) and extensive land clearance, tend to be stable or growing while the relatively sediment-starved marshes of the Eastern Shore are being lost. In the Baie du Mont Saint Michel, France, there is a positive sediment budget. The salt marshes are growing at a current estimated rate of 90,000 meters2 per year (Haslett et al., 2003), so even in the face of rising sea level, with enough sediment supply marshes can still grow."}, {"section_title": "Marsh Structure", "text": "Tidal marshes have a characteristic structure dominated by the interaction between tidal range and marsh topography (Stevenson et al., 1986). In tidal marshes, , the incoming tide flows over the creek banks, and because the sediment carrying capacity is directly related to velocity, the bulk of the sediment is deposited on the creek banks, building stable levees with a large percentage of inorganic material (Esselink et al., 1998;French and Spencer, 1993;Hatton et al., 1983;(Kearney et al., 1988)). However, if insufficient sediment is available for transport, or for other reasons, levee building may not always occur, as has been reported for marshes along the lower Nanticoke River in Maryland (Kearney et al., 1988). The interior of the marsh typically receives little inorganic input (Kearney et al., 1988(Kearney et al., , 1994French and Spencer, 1993), and the sediment there frequently consists of organic material derived from local plant production, although some organic material may be imported by flooding (Cahoon and Reed, 1995). These landscape features are important in the face of sea level rise. If the low marsh areas fail to keep up with sea level rise, they will likely drown first. However, rising sea level may eventually convert the high marsh to low marsh. Kearney et al. (1988) discuss three geomorphic types of land loss. \" 1 Shoreline retreat is a result of wave erosion and is thought to account for only 1% of coastal marsh loss in the U.S. (Gosselink and Baumann, 1980). Widening of tidal creeks ( Figure 3) is caused by erosion along tidal creek banks, which is most prevalent in estuarine meander marshes where growth of tidal networks can be promoted Gammill and Hosier, 1992). It is similar to creek bank erosion just before bankfull stage in rivers, but in this case probably reflects rising tidal prisms due to sea level rise. Burrowing animals, such as crabs and bivalves, may play a role by weakening the marsh sediments (the root mat) and facilitating erosion (Frey and Basan, 1985). In some coastal marshes of the Chesapeake Bay, creek bank erosion has accounted for as much as 20 -30 percent of total marsh loss since 1938 (Kearney et al., 1988). Interior ponding (Figure 4 and Figure 5) begins with the formation of small pannes which can form from eat-outs by ducks, geese, and muskrats, but are likely a response to slow rates of vertical accretion begins with the formation of small pannes (Stevenson et al., 1985). When water stays on the surface in these pannes too long, plant roots are subjected to stress due to the long periods of anoxic soil conditions. The prolonged exposure to higher salinity and anoxia may kill the plants whose roots hold the substrate together. Once the plants die, the sediment can become resuspended due to tidal or storm action and removed with the ebb tide. Bryant and Chabreck (1998) discuss this removal of plant detritus from impounded areas. The mobility of sediments in and out can make a large difference in this process. If sediments are readily available for import, the panne may be refilled (Mitsch and Gosselink, 2000), especially when sediment is remobilized after hurricanes. Eventually, the panne may become a permanently filled pond. At this point, the pond can begin to grow as more plants at the periphery die, and more sediment is resuspended and removed during storm events. Eventually, neighboring ponds will begin to coalesce and become large enough that storm-driven waves can begin to actively erode the edges (Kearney et al., 1988, Stevenson et al., 1985."}, {"section_title": "Sea level rise", "text": "Rates of sea-level rise for much of the Eastern Seaboard and Gulf Coast are generally held to be the underlying cause (Dame and Childers, 1992;Kearney et al., 1988;Stevenson and Kearney, 1996) for the dramatic decline (approximately 50%) in marsh acreage since 1900 (Gosselink and Baumann, 1980). Marshes in some places cannot migrate inland due to land form constraints such as the Pleistocene Talbot terrace landward of some Nanticoke River marshes (Kearney et al., 1988) or due to human intervention, such as bulkheads (Titus, 1998), or by being completely surrounded by the sea, such as Bloodsworth Island (Downs et al., 1994). The studies of the relationship of marsh development to sea level rise raise concerns about marsh survival in the 21st century, when the global sea level trend may accelerate due to greenhouse warming (Nyman et al., 1995). Reflecting this uncertainty, Bricker-Urso et al. (1989) concluded that the New England marshes might be characterized by a maximum vertical accretion rate that, if exceeded by local relative sea level rise, will cause these marshes to disappear. The impact from sea level rise is not distributed evenly over the course of a tidal river. Figure 6 shows that maximum sediment input will occur where the tidal range is highest (Morris et al., 2002), which is not necessarily at one end of the river system. As relative sea level rises, water that is more saline will move into the system, hydroperiods will increase, resulting in increased duration of hypoxic soil conditions. Plants at the lower end of the river are already the most salt-tolerant species. Therefore, as the hypoxia kills the existing plant community, there are no other plants capable of replacing it. At the fresh water end, however, plant community shifts can allow the marsh system to continue. Even S. alterniflora, among the most adapted of coastal marsh plants to rising salinity, will eventually succumb to drowning (Mendelssohn et al., 1982)."}, {"section_title": "Anthropological Impacts", "text": "However, coastal marshes are also being threatened by a variety of human activities including oil and gas extraction (Dijkema, 1997;White and Morton, 1997;White and Tremblay, 1995), urban development, sediment diversion, and possibly other factors, such as road construction (Stevenson and Kearney, 1996). Marsh management techniques may also promote loss (Gabrey et al., 1999). Such techniques include marsh burning in fall or winter, or structural marsh management (SMM), which uses levees and water control systems to regulate the hydroperiod of enclosed areas (Gabrey et al., 1999;Kuhn et al., 1999). Both approaches can limit the vertical accretion by reducing detrital inputs (in the case of marsh burning) or mineral sediment inputs (in the case of levees and other hydroperiod controls). In a study of four hypotheses explaining loss of marshes in Louisiana, the losses correlated with canals and accompanying dredge spoil levees lining the canals (Turner, 1997). The combination of canals, which drain water, and levees, which prevent overwash, has the double impact of lowering the water table in the wetlands while simultaneously preventing tidal overwash from reaching the marsh surface with nutrients and sediment."}, {"section_title": "Fauna", "text": "In addition to these factors, animal populations may influence the health of marshes in various ways. Snow geese (Gabrey et al, 1999) and Nutria (Carter et al., 1999) (Dame and Childers, 1992). Nutria, an invasive species, may cause destruction of the marsh substrate by grubbing for roots. Evers et al. (1998) found that, although Nutria could not be shown to be more destructive than waterfowl, they can cause reductions in plant biomass and productivity. They also found that areas grazed by both waterfowl and Nutria tend to be more affected than areas grazed by only one. Grace and Ford (1996) discussed the impact of Nutria on Louisiana marshes from the findings of numerous other scientists and their own work. Their finding, using simulated herbivory, was that some marsh plants (Sagittaria lancifolia in particular) can recover quickly even after suffering stress from storm-induced salt water intrusion."}, {"section_title": "Flora", "text": "The interaction between plants and marsh degradation can be quite complex. Plant communities can help to stabilize the marsh by trapping sediment and providing litter (Morris et al., 2002). For Spartina alterniflora, the maximum growth occurs when the plants are below the mean high tide (MHT). In North Inlet, South Carolina, much of the S. alterniflora is above its optimal position and is stunted. However, as sea level rises, plants respond with more growth, which traps more sediment, which maintains the elevation (Morris et al., 2002). The high marsh is only slightly higher than the low marsh, but the elevation difference is just sufficient to decrease the hydroperiod so that different plant species grow there. For example, Phragmites australis tends to grow in the high marsh and invade low marsh areas (if salinities are very low). Even in the low marsh areas P. australis produces more biomass than Spartina patens in the same environment, and the material is more resistant to microbial degradation (Windham, 2001). It follows from this that P. australis can contribute more inorganic material to the marsh surface than S. patens, at least under some conditions. Stribling and Cornwell (2001) (Sullivan et al., 1991). The Delaware Inland Bays have in excess of 6,573 acres of tidal wetlands (Weston, Inc., 1992). Over 2,000 acres were lost from 1938 -1973 (Weston, Inc., 1992). Natural losses are attributed to sea level rise, natural succession, the hydrologic cycle, erosion, sedimentation and fire. Human induced losses are attributed to drainage and channelization, filling for development, dredging, pond construction, timber harvesting, and water pollution and waste disposal (Tiner, 1985). The Albemarle-Pamlico Sound is the largest sound formed behind barrier beaches on the East Coast (Stanley, 1993). Although the region is relatively undeveloped, human activities such as draining, dredging and filling in connection with agriculture, housing development and forestry still change the marshes (Stanley, 1993). In 1962, there were an estimated 4,897 hectares of salt marsh in Pamlico Sound and none in Albemarle Sound . There are eight times as many acres of nontidal and brackish marshes as salt marshes in Pamlico Sound. Large areas of marsh were previously altered by mosquito ditches and creating impoundments for waterfowl. A moratorium on ditching has been in place and future losses from direct human impacts should be minimal (Kuenzler and Marshall, 1973;Steel, 1991). The different histories for each of these areas will cause differences in outcomes as to rates and locality of marsh loss. However, by averaging data from the entire East Coast, the general trends will be isolated and impact of the individual histories will be lessened in the aggregation.     Plant community maximally adapted to high salinity. Upstream Figure 6. Changing Impact of Sea Level Rise along a River. This picture is only an example.

These processes produce distinctive large and small-scale physical changes in the marsh surface (Kearney and Stevenson, 1989). Based on the different stages of marsh loss, Kearney et al. (1988) developed a marsh surface condition index (MSCI) to classify marshes in the Nanticoke However, aerial photography is very expensive to update despite its advantages in terms of accuracy and ability to record species differences (Rice et al., 2000). Satellite data are available on a regular schedule at a comparatively moderate price. This MSCI does not work well with Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite imagery, however. The visual analysis is time-consuming and susceptible to interpreter bias. More importantly, from the perspective of marsh conservation, purely visual inspection of TM imagery, which lacks the detail of large-scale aerial photography, generally cannot detect reliably the very earliest stages of marsh loss when remediation efforts may be most successful."}, {"section_title": "Spatial limitations of field-work based studies", "text": "Most studies of marsh loss and related topics such as vertical accretion rates, examine only small areas, even if the individual plots are spread over a wide area. Gross et al. (1993), for example, studied above-ground and below-ground Spartina alterniflora biomass production at five sites scattered from Nova Scotia to Georgia. For many other studies, sample sizes ranged from 2 to 27 sites with study areas ranging from 20 meters to 100 km. (Bricker-Urso et al., 1989;Craft and Broome, 1993;Dame and Childers, 1992;Esselink et al., 1998;French and Spencer, 1993;Hatton et al., 1983;Halupa and Howes, 1995;Hutchinson et al., 1995;Kaye and Barghoorn, 1964;Ke et al., 1994;Kearney et al., 1988;Kearney et al., 1994;Kelley et al., 1995;Kokot, 1997;Leonard et al., 1995;Morrison et al., 1990Morrison et al., , 1990Murray and Spencer, 1997;Netto and Lana, 1997;Nyman et al., 1995;Orson et al., 1990;Orson and Howes, 1992;Osgood and Santos, 1995;Pethick, 1981;Ramsey et al., 1997a;Van der Molen, 1997;Wang at al., 1993;Wray et al., 1995). The small size of these studies is appropriate because it is a scale on which humans can make detailed measurements of chemistry, current velocities, sedimentation rates and other parameters. However, it is difficult to integrate the data across larger areas, in part because the parameters measured can fluctuate widely over small distances (Rogers, unpublished data). Using such data, and the numerous data points collected by other researchers, does not lend itself to aggregation of losses and reliable estimation of losses in areas not sampled. Moreover, the rapidity of marsh loss processes in its later stages (cf. Kearney et al., 1988), even for those areas for which relatively recent information is available, can quickly make site investigations and aerial photography data outdated. Updating the status of marsh condition involves organizing and conducting new and often time-consuming field or aerial surveys. Moreover, because the data derived in this manner is generally not immediately amenable to digital analysis, incorporation in broader synoptic assessments of coastal marsh change can involve further lengthy processing. For many areas, such as the Atlantic coastline where there are hundreds of thousands of hectares of marsh, the scale of such a task is clearly daunting. Only two studies, the CoastWatch Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) program (NOAA) and the National Wetlands Inventory done by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, are comparable in size to the output of this project -they are both, in fact, much larger, and are the subject of debate. Both of these are extremely labor intensive requiring 1000's of person-hours to accomplish. As late as 1994, it was stated, \"The CoastWatch program will be national in scope and require ... many agencies and investigators ...\" (Civco et al., 1994). Therefore, a study comprising the area used here has never been undertaken with the ease and repeatability of this study."}, {"section_title": "Image Analysis", "text": "Remotely sensed data are difficult to interpret, especially in areas where the pixels are likely to be highly mixed composites of surface types (Mathieu et al., 1994;Foody and Cox, 1994;Huete, 1986 Mixture modeling has the potential to recover actual percent coverages despite this complexity (Mathieu et al. 1994;Foody and Cox, 1994). Nevertheless, mixture modeling has certain inherent limitations. Traditionally, a linear model is assumed, but a linear combination of spectra does not necessarily reproduce measured composite scene spectra (Borel and Gerstl, 1994). Linear mixture modeling is based on certain assumptions. The most important assumption is that the signal received at the satellite from any ground parcel is simply the additive sum of the reflectances of all the surface covers in the parcel, weighted by the fraction of the parcel occupied by each surface cover. The standard linear mixture model for three endmembers and three spectral bands may be represented as: where n is the number of bands, ij represents the reflectance of surface cover type j in band i, f represents the fraction of the pixel covered by cover type j and e represents random error in band i. The following restrictions are assumed in linear mixture modeling: 1) Any pixel on the ground is made up of a composite of spectrally pure cover types -the spectra of these cover types are used as endmembers in the analysis. 2) The signal received at the satellite is the linear, weighted sum of the radiances from each cover type in the pixel. 3) The percent of the pixel that each cover type occupies can be recovered by inverting Equation 1 and solving for each f j . 4) The number of endmembers cannot exceed the number of spectral bands used. 5) All the f j 's must sum to one. To make sense, the endmembers must be selected from the boundary of the data space (Mathieu-Marni et al. 1996) and must be consistently in the same place. Analysis of remotely sensed images is often done by a classification scheme that assigns a single cover type to each pixel or polygon in an output map. In a supervised classification, spectral signatures are developed by having an analyst choose pixels in the satellite image that contain the feature of interest. The computer then generates a signature for that cover type. In unsupervised classification, the computer analyzes the image and breaks it into spectral classes. In either supervised or unsupervised classification, once the spectral signatures are calculated, every pixel in the scene is tested to determine which spectra it matches most closely. Mixture analysis techniques, in contrast to traditional classification systems, can assign more than one value to a pixel. Most pixels are mixtures of various surface covers (Huete, 1986) and mixture modeling attempts to calculate the fractional covers. Donoghue et al. (1994) compared linear unmixing and maximum likelihood classification (MLC) and found that both were 90% accurate in delimiting the intertidal vegetation. While both produced poorer results in the intertidal zone, linear unmixing proved better able to map pioneer vegetation such as Spartina anglica and Salicornia fragilis than the MLC. Mixture models and classification procedures often have serious inherent flaws. They are not reproducible across scenes, and they cannot properly interpret the sometimes excessive number of soil and vegetation endmembers present in a scene (Smith et al., 1994;Williamson et al., 1994) nor do they include non-linear scattering (Borel and Gerstl, 1994). To overcome the high variability inherent in scenes, the tendency in many efforts is toward more complexity in the models (e.g., Roberts et al., 1993). This approach can only work to the extent that the inputs are linear and there are no more actual endmembers than input independent data channels. Typical mixture modeling is based on the assumptions of linearity outlined above (Fung and LeDrew, 1987;Bierwirth et al., 1990a,b;Gong et al., 1991;Mackin et al., 1990;Holben and Shimabukuro, 1993;Roberts et al., 1993;Settle and Drake, 1993;Cherchali and Flouzat, 1994;Foody and Cox, 1994;Puyou-Lacassies et al., 1994;Smith et al., 1994;Williamson, 1994;Mathieu-Marni et al.,1996a,b). Most of these authors and others (Harsanyi and Chein, 1994) rely on rotating the data matrices and scene-by -scene ground referencing to improve reliability. Obviously, scene-by -scene collection of ground reference data reduces the utility of remote sensing to some degree."}, {"section_title": "Selection of endmembers", "text": "Endmembers are the required spectral endpoints for unmixing multispectral data. There are four general methods for obtaining them. Spectra can be : 1) collected in a laboratory setting (Bierwirth, 1990a,b); 2) collected in the field; 3) extracted from the image to be unmixed (Cherchali and Flouzat, 1994;Gong et al., 1991;Mackin et al (1990); Puyou-Lacassies et al., 1994); 4) derived, for example, by Varimax rotation of the principal components (Mathieu-Marni et al., 1996 a, b). These can also be combined. Williamson (1994) used PCA, the spectral distribution of the data and ground reference data to select endmembers. Novo and Shimabukuro (1994) derived spectra in the field for their three endmembers (using a Spectron SE590); however, the endmembers chosen are spectrally similar being chlorophyll a, DOM (Dissolved organic material) and TSS (total suspended solids). They state that, although there were confounding factors at each station used for a pure endmember, they did not use laboratory spectra because such spectra for phytoplankton suspensions typically do not match field spectra. Spectra were analyzed over the range from 400 -800 nm, and then by analyzing the fractions and residuals from unmixing their data, they refined the spectral regions needed to produce the best results. Then they developed a regression equation between the model data and measured concentrations of their three endmembers. This method is essentially the same as using image-derived data since the SE590 data was what they analyzed. Although endmembers gathered in a laboratory offer assurance of consistency and accuracy, there is no assurance that they represent endmembers as defined in the spectral space of the image (Gong et al., 1991;Smith et al., 1990a, b). Moreover, there is also no assurance that they match the spectra of real objects in the environment despite the fact that those object may be made of the same material (Bierwirth, 1990a). However, for distinguishing between spectrally similar targets, such as various soil types, it has the advantage over image-derived spectra of providing the ability to resolve closely related spectra. Image or laboratory derived spectra, to be reliable across scenes, require standardization of the scenes with radiometric and atmospheric correction. Laboratoryderived spectra have the additional limitation of narrowing the variance associated with the cover type sought, perhaps eliminating marginal areas inappropriately. Endmembers selected from the image itself are more likely to represent true endmembers, take into account the natural variability of the endmembers and the conditions under which they are found, but may not actually represent any given physical material such as could be identified in the laboratory. Nonetheless, regardless of the method by which the spectra are derived, ultimately ground referencing is required. For the purposes of the research only interested in three surface covers -soil, water and vegetation -are of interest. These spectra are quite diverse and well known (Richards, 1986). The water and vegetation endmembers are readily distinguishable by a variety of methods including finding relatively pure training sites in the image and locating them at predictable places in plots of various spectral bands. Pixels representing bare soil are also easily identified in the image, although identifying them in a spectral plot is not simple. There are several reasons for this. The spectra of soils, although consistent in shape, can vary considerably in brightness. For instance, the organic soils of the Delmarva Peninsula and sand in South Carolina both exhibit a monotonic increase from Band 1 through Band 5 although the sand is extremely bright and the organic soils are not. Another complication is that senesced vegetation can look a lot like soil. Gausman et al. (1975) plot the spectra of crop residues and soils. The soils and residues have very similar spectra, and the crop residue is very dissimilar to live plant. In another study, crop residues and soils were found to be spectrally similar, only differing in their amplitude at given wavelengths. In fact, wavelengths around 2100 nm were required to distinguish crop residue from soil reliably, due to a cellulose/lignin absorption feature at that wavelength. This is much farther into the IR than the NDX bands (Daughtry, 2001). If separating senesced vegetation from soil were necessary for this project, this would be a good wavelength to use. However, that separation is unnecessary here. This could cause confusion, except that for this project there is little consequential difference between dead plants and soil. The main point of interest being that neither is water. In both PCA space and raw spectral space, there is no single endmember that captures soil effectively. When spectral endmembers from one scene were applied to different scenes of the same area (Wingate, MD) the results were at least reasonable, even though somewhat noisy. The same endmembers applied to South Carolina, however, made the entire North Inlet marsh system appear to be open water. With ground reference data in hand and considerable effort, a soil endmember was finally located in the South Carolina image that produced correct results. Nonetheless, this hardly describes a method that can be used by others. In fact, when several different people attempted to select a soil endmember from diverse scenes using PCA, the results were extremely disappointing. One would expect a good correlation between the spectra derived from PCA in different scenes; however, in some cases they were negatively correlated with each other. In addition, the PCA plots featured other pixels as the endmembers, not soil. Laboratory spectra can be ruled out due to the lack of a reliable water spectrum (Kirk, 1994), and because an inordinate number of soil spectra would be required to cover all the soil types encountered in this research work. PCA-derived endmembers are not of much use due to the low likelihood of selecting an actual soil endmember -and, again, the large number of soil spectra that would be required. Vegetation ratio indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) rely on the soil line in plots of red vs. infrared reflectance. Because most soil spectra fall on or near this line and the intercept of the line is close to zero, a wide range of soils will have nearly identical NDVI values (Huete, 1989)."}, {"section_title": "The New Technique", "text": "The technique used here is a hybrid of traditional classification and mixture model analysis. Although the resulting classification is a single value for each pixel, the classification is based on using mixture modeling to calculate the percentage water in the pixel rather than statistical or quasi-statistical manipulations of the spectral data -for example, maximum likelihood classification or clustering techniques. The power of the technique is based, not on complex mathematical or image assessment techniques, but on simplifying the task of the remote sensing to the extent possible. The current work focuses on a single parameter -the percentage of water in a pixel rather than a variety of issues such as plant health or community structure. Because there is no intention to differentiate plant species or soil types, the remote sensing model can be greatly simplified. It is similar to some of the mixture modeling techniques, shown above, which are reasonably accurate. However, the current technique is less affected by the variability of soil, water and vegetation spectral responses than a simple linear model. The analysis is further simplified by conversion of the data space so that there are mathematically only three endmembers. Automation is possible because it is not necessary to extract endmembers from each image, nor are large banks of spectral endmembers that might be present in the image necessary. One set of three endmembers can be used with all images to unmix coastal marshes (Rogers and Kearney, 2004). . The technique relies on high-quality atmospheric correction (Fallah-Adl et al., 1996;Liang et al., 1997;Donoghue et al., 1994) and the use of spectral indices similar to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Although normalized differences are used for vegetation mapping (e.g. Baret and Guyot, 1991) and have been used for water mapping (McFeeters, 1996), spectral indices have not been used in a mixture model analysis previously. The transformed indices Rogers and Kearney, 2004)  This transformation redistributes the data points so that NDWI places surface covers that are brighter in Band 3 than Band 5 at the top of the scale. The NDSI and NDVI behave similarly for band pairs 5 and 4, and 4 and 3, respectively. Because of the characteristics of surface reflectance, this will normally result in soil-dominated pixels having the highest values on the NDSI, green vegetation-dominated pixels having the highest values on the NDVI, and water-dominated pixels having the highest values on the NDWI. Non-photosynthetic or senesced vegetation may be confused with soil and a few soils maybe confused with vegetation. However, as the purpose of this process is to separate water from everything else, potential confusion of the vegetation and soil endmembers is expected to have limited impact on the overall model. The resulting indices are then unmixed using the principles of linear unmixing already described. The output of this remote sensing technique is the input for the risk model."}, {"section_title": "Various Issues with the NDXI Technique", "text": "Normalized Difference Indexes Quarmby et al. (1992) state that the NDVI cannot be used in a mixture model because, being a ratio, it violates the assumptions of mixture modeling. Principally, it is not expected to scale with changing area. However, tests with real data have shown that it does scale with changes in area (see Rogers and Kearney, 2004). On the other hand, randomly assigned pixel values do not produce normalized difference indices that scale when averaged over different areas. This would indicate that the NDXI technique measures real properties of the surface, and that the real properties are fractional coverages of the various scene components. The NDVI has been shown to be functionally related to absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (Asrar, 1984;Sellers 1985Sellers , 1987, which is of interest in global vegetation studies. The NDVI is used for global vegetation monitoring because it helps compensate for changing illumination, surface slope and other extraneous factors (Lillesand and Kiefer, 1994). Consider the case for water: In a pool of infinitely deep, uniform water, the illumination at any depth would be given by Equation 5. where is the reflectance of a thin layer. The upwelling light just below surface from a layer at depth z would be:  (   2  0= . For an infinitely deep pool, e-2kz -> 0. Therefore, Equation 10. Putting this into the normalized difference form, and assuming that the incident radiation has been corrected for atmospheric haze and illumination angle, gives: which, for pure water, is a constant. This research, of course, deals with estuarine water, which is more variable. The above calculations ignore the effects of the light entering the water and leaving the water. For the moment, we will assume that on average this is constant as well. In Equation 12, the below surface upwards radiance is for a point. If each of the radiances were integrated over an area, the area would simply cancel. The same basic logic would also apply to pixels of pure, homogeneous vegetation or pure, homogeneous soil. Further, for mixtures of soil, vegetation and water the radiance in each pixel for one band would be Equation 13. where n is the number of surface cover types. In the normalized difference, the TotalArea would again divide out. Several factors may affect the reflectance. Among these are the non-Lambertian properties of leaves, soil and water. The resulting anisotropic reflectance function is called the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). For TM data, the change in view angle on each sensor sweep is about 7.5 degrees off nadir. According to Myneni and Asrar (1994), the change in top of the atmosphere NDVI over this range of view angles is negligible. Secondly, the solar zenith angle will affect both the irradiance and the refraction/reflectance of light at the surface. The atmospheric correction algorithm compensates for the changes in irradiance on a seasonal and latitudinal basis. The Fresnell equation and Snell's law predict how much light will be reflected and how strongly the light that does penetrate the surface will be refracted (Ingle and Crouch, 1988). The solar angle for latitudes of interest in this work will vary between 30 and 48 degrees during the late spring to early autumn time frame of the images used. This will cause a change of approximately 30% in surface reflection and approximately 1% decrease in transmission into the body of water. Because most of the reflection will be specular 2 , it will not enter into the satellite sensor's field of view. The 1% change in transmission into the water will not cause a significant change in upwelling light. The depth of the water and bottom reflectance will also affect the results. The above calculations hold for infinitely deep water, so the question arises: How deep does the water have to be before it can be considered to be of infinite optical depth? Given that the TM data are quantized as eight bits, the smallest change detectable would be 1/256 of the reflected radiation. Any change in reflectance smaller than that amount will not be recordable. For the three TM bands used in the NDXI technique, the \"infinite\" depths are calculated based on where the kz e 2 term falls below 1/256 of the reflected radiation using the data in Table 1. Using values of 10%, 50% and 30% (estimated from Townshend et al., 1988) as the reflectance values for Bands 3, 4 and 5 respectively, gives the values in the \"Infinite depth\" column of Table 1. Pure water was used for Bands 4 and 5 because measurements of absorption in estuarine waters at those wavelengths are unavailable, for the obvious reason that not much light is returned. For these bands, bottom reflectance will only be a factor in Band 3 and of some consequence in Band 4. For Band 5, however, by the time a body of water gets as shallow as 3 \u00b5 it is, arguably, not a body of water any more. What this means is that for shallow, clear water, there will be a bottom reflectance component in Band 3. For the three indices chosen, Band 3 -Band 5, Band 4 -Band 5 and Band 3-Band 4, this will only affect the NDWI signal. The key to the NDWI signal is that it interprets surface covers that are brighter in Band 3 than Band 5 as being water. If the water were more algae or sediment laden, Band 3 would be brighter than Band 5. If the water is perfectly clear in a pixel, Band 3 will be brighter than Band 5. The calibration will be different for these two cases, but the overall effect should be that water will look like water.  (Gates et al., 1965). Reflectance in the NIR is dominated by scattering from the interfaces between cell walls and air spaces in the leaf (Peterson and Running, 1989;Gausman et al., 1969). Leaf reflectance spectra are also affected by water absorption bands and other properties, but these are either not within the spectral range of interest here or are of less significance than the chlorophyll absorption and mesophyll (Walter-Shea et al., 1992) scattering. For instance, leaf NIR optical properties are little affected by pigments (Maas and Dunlap, 1989). However, leaf water content may directly affect NIR scattering. As leaves lose water, this reduces cell turgor, which can affect the relative cell surface, intracellular air spaces, and consequently reduce NIR reflectance (Levitt and Ben Zaken, 1975)."}, {"section_title": "Separating Plant and Algae-Laden Water Signals", "text": "Because green plant reflectance in the IR is dominated by structure of the plant, there is no corresponding increase in water reflectance even at high algal concentrations. The reflectance of water in the IR is dominated by the absorption of water and the particulate load (Tyler and Stumpf, 1989) and although there is an increase in reflectance associated with increased particulate counts in the water, it is unlikely ever to exceed the reflectance of the same water body in the red region. Figure 7 shows calibrated radiances for nine locations in the Patuxent River collected in June 1992, by the author. It is not possible to calculate exact TMcomparable NDVI's for these without applying a spectral response function for the TM's sensors. However, an approximation can be obtained by summing across the spectral bands and ratioing the results. It can be seen ( Table 2) that there is some variation in the NDVI based on the changes in the water column. If NDVI exclusively were used to extract results, this would pose a more serious problem. However, with three endmembers the water with higher sediment and/or algae concentrations will be shown not to be pure water when it is unmixed. It is obvious, however, that no matter how much algae is added to the water, it will not look like a mixture of vegetation and water. For NDXI, measurements are all made with Bands 3, 4 and 5. Bands 4 and 5 are well beyond the reflectance maximum of water containing chlorophyll a and its various derivatives and gelbstoffe (the combination of long-chain fulvic and humic acids that give natural water its yellow -brown color). The region between the absorption maxima of various photopigments is where the highest variability in water reflectance typically occurs ( Figure 7)."}, {"section_title": "Effects of Tides and Rain", "text": "Field spectra are of great value in understanding the likely impact of various changes on the received spectrum. For example, Stutzer (1997) measured the changes in reflectance of wetland plants as water depth changed over the expected microtidal range in Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge and surrounding marshes as part of his work for the Coastal Marsh Project. The result showed that the 0 -10 % range of water in a vegetated area could not be differentiated from the 10 -20% range, due to tidal fluctuations. However, tides in the microtidal range could not raise water levels high enough to make healthy vegetated areas look like they were moderately deteriorated (20 -30% water),."}, {"section_title": "Endmembers", "text": "How accurate are the endmember spectra? Table 3 lists NDVI values for open water calculated from the two images. The mean values are at the low end of the range in Table 2, which are calculated from the spectra in Figure 7. This means that the spectra represented in Table 2 with higher chlorophyll concentrations would be correctly unmixed as having other properties. These numbers are scaled 0 -255, so the difference in means represented in Table 3 is about 2%. The number of replicate pixels makes it clear that we have captured the signature of water very reliably. Table 4 shows the spectra for all three endmembers in both TM bands and normalized difference bands. The normalized difference transformation reduces the standard deviations in most cases. Spectra extracted from various scenes match well with published spectra (e.g., Richards, 1986)."}, {"section_title": "General Improvement Over Standard Linear Unmixing:", "text": "The four panels of Figure 8 show spectral data from a computer-generated set of pixel values. The data actually comprises 7 spectrally distinct endmembers, three soils (red), two waters (blue) and two vegetations (green). The data was generated from three spectral bands representing the Thematic Mapper Bands 3, 4 and 5. A problem arises immediately in trying to interpret the data because there are only three bands of input data but seven spectral endmembers. One might think of adding extra TM bands to the data input, but this has severe limitations. There are only 7 bands in TM data, and there is information overlap between them (Townshend et al., 1988). Due to the variability of reflectances of different materials, this situation of having more spectral endmembers than input channels is liable to persist even with larger numbers of bands. Because there are only three spectral channels available, only three spectral endmembers can be assessed at one time. In this case, two of the soil endmembers closely resemble each other, as do the pairs of vegetation and water endmember spectra. The problem can then be reduced to four endmembers. Standard linear mixture modeling still cannot cope with the number of endmembers present in a typical scene. In fact, every endmember selection will be wrong ( Figure 8). If you select the actual endmembers on the graph, you will always get a wrong answer. For example, if the soil endmember on the upper right in the PCA plot were chosen, the soil endmember on the lower left would be unmixed as though it were some proportion of the upper right soil endmember. Similarly, the soil endmember in the middle of the Band 3, 4, 5 plot would show unmix as 50 percent soil using standard techniques. The NDXI transformed data, however, are much better behaved. The water and vegetation endmembers do not get closer to each other, but the soil endmembers are now almost identical (Figure 8).   Table 5 shows this. The table shows the results of applying the same mixing algorithm to several 1000 pixels with randomly assigned fractional cover values. Although each unmixed dataset gives a strong linear relationship with the input fractional covers, for the linear method the regression coefficients change significantly every time. The NDX coefficients remain relatively consistent. The pixels were mixed using a non-linear model with variation built-in. Clouds and cloud-shadows are removed largely by hand. In areas for which there are multiple images, clouds and cloud shadows can also be removed by image overlays, replacing the bad pixels in one scene with clear pixels from another. three scenes created randomly from standard inputs. Each scene was unmixed by the two different techniques and the results are shown here. The input data for all scenes were created using the same endmember spectra and randomization techniques for generating pixel values. The PCA output is quite different between scenes, whereas the NDXI values remain constant. All are scaled 0 -255. Secondly, although there should be no problem differentiating water from the other two endmembers in general, at the margins there are problems in assigning meaning to the interpretation. Particularly the cases of very shallow water vs. very wet mud, or very sediment-laden water vs. very wet mud are problematic. IR radiation is highly absorbed by water, which is why the IR bands were chosen for the much of the work. This means that even in relatively shallow water bottom reflectance will not have much effect (because Band 3 will still be brighter than Band 5). However, as the water depth approaches zero, there will be a depth at which the underlying soil becomes very apparent, even in the IR. It is not yet clear how to separate this from the case of very wet mud. Essentially, these two questions transcend the scope of image analysis, because neither is entirely clear from ground observations. One is, at what water depth should the surface classification change from wet mud to water over sediment? The second is, what is the proportion of water: sediment at which the change from mud to sediment-laden water occurs?

The mainland marshes could have been put in the inland marsh group with the large bays, but due to their narrowness and proximity to the coast were left in the coastal group. This study area was chosen to minimize variation related to climate and other variables while defining an area containing a large amount of data. In particular, the MidAtlantic marshes lie on the coastal plain, differentiating them from the geomorphology of New England marshes to the north (Mitsch and Gosselink, 2000). South of the MidAtlantic region, there are changes in productivity, tidal regimes, and climate. Furthermore, marsh loss rates decline precipitously below North Carolina (Gosselink and Baumann, 1980). Coastal marshes under consideration are those classified as \"estuarine intertidal\" and subclassified as either emergent or scrub-shrub (Cowardin et al., 1979) by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI). The Chesapeake and Delaware estuaries are defined as drowned river valleys (Pritchard, 1967). The marshes along the Atlantic Coast, however, have different origins. The Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds are \"bar-built\" estuaries, either former shallow marine areas or flooded coastal plains (Pritchard, 1967). On this basis, the study area was divided into two large subsets -the bay area, comprising the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays, and the Atlantic Coast -comprising everything else. A test area, comprising the Blackwater, Transquaking, Nanticoke and Wicomico rivers and the surrounding area, was selected for development of algorithms.

Registration was done to less than 1 TM pixel (28.5 meters) accuracy in both the horizontal and vertical axes. A second-order polynomial fit was used with approximately 40 ground control points for each image to project the unmixed data applying the values of the nearest neighbor in the input to the output pixels. Prior to rectification, Thematic Mapper images were atmospherically corrected using the method of Fallah-Adl et al., (1996). The resulting data are in reflectance units after correcting for haze, solar zenith angle, and solar distance from the earth. This allows the remaining steps to be standardized for all scenes. Image data were put into a PCI database and transformed into three normalized difference indices the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI, Equation 2), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI, Equation 3) and Normalized Difference Soil Index (NDSI, Equation 4) (Rogers and Kearney, 2004) as described in Chapter 2. Several diverse TM images were transformed and endmembers selected using PCI's scatterplot (SPL) and visual outlier removal (VOR) subroutines. Pixels representing each of the three endmembers selected were located in the image and, by examining their spectra and using positional data from the scene were determined, in fact, to represent water, soil, or vegetation. From these image-derived spectra, one set of endmembers was chosen to represent the most extreme endmembers and these were applied to all images. The three normalized difference indices were unmixed using PCI's unmix subroutine to create three percent cover channels -one each for soil, vegetation and water. Pixel values that would have fallen below 0 were reset to 0. Pixels where the vegetation is less than 10% and there is more soil than water were flagged as outside the scope of the wetlands model (Rogers and Kearney, 2004). Clouds were masked by selecting any pixel with a DN greater than 80 in TM band 1. The value of 80 was based on preliminary analysis of the images. Remaining clouds and cloud shadows were masked by hand. Ground reference data from fieldwork and aerial photography were used to create a calibration curve to convert the mixture model results into actual percentages. The images used were late spring to early fall, so there was no snow cover; and buildings, roads and other non-marsh surface covers were all removed by applying a mask based on the NWI polygons. Ramsey et al. (2001) made a similar use of NWI masks to perform analysis of coastal marshes for the Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP). They used NWI masks to separate classes that could not be separated spectrally in TM images such as estuarine and palustrine marshes. After processing, the individual images were combined into larger coverages. To do this, it is assumed that all interferences with the recorded signal (atmospheric haze, high tide, recent rainfall) make the marsh in the pixel look more degraded than it is. Therefore, to assign a value where images overlap, the lowest percentage water value from the input pixels was assigned to the output pixel. In this way, incorrectly classified pixels can be corrected, and pixels that were covered by clouds or shadows in one image may be replaced by clearly viewed pixels from another to produce a final product. Where bodies of water meet the land surface of the marsh, pixels will tend to be mixed. This is unavoidable and will cause an overestimation of marsh loss along shorelines and creek banks. Because there is no way to know if this is really happening, or if the pixels aligned correctly with stream banks, such points cannot be rejected outright, but cannot be taken too seriously, either."}, {"section_title": "National Wetlands Inventory Data", "text": "NWI digital wetlands data were available as 7.5-minute orthophotoquads, Updated coverages were downloaded from the NWI website in December, 2002 and inserted into the NWI coverages that had been compiled by the Coastal Marsh Project.

This function takes two inputs: a mask and a cost grid. The cost grid assigns a resistance value or cost for traversing each unit of surface area. In this study, the units are meters. The mask contains a set of discrete source points in a grid. The non-source points in the grid must be NULL values. The costdistance function calculates the least cost path from each gridcell in the output grid to each source in the input grid using the costs assigned in the cost grid. If the entire costgrid were set to 1, then the distance calculated will be the actual physical distance. For example, using the marsh data and a resistance of 1, the cost of traversing one grid cell from side to side would be 28.5, the width of a cell in meters multiplied by the cost per meter. If the same cell were traversed on the diagonal, the cost would be 28.5 * 21/2. Any NULL values in the cost grid are treated as impenetrable cells, and the least cost path must go around them. Although the costdistance function requires the non-source points in the mask to be NULL values, many ESRI functions, which use the same information, require the masks to use 0 instead of NULL values. In the amls listed in Appendix C, the masks are often converted from the null to the zero form for this reason. A separate mask had to be generated for distance from each effect type (land, tidal creek, downstream limit and roads). In the stream mask, all water bodies that had no discernible connection to tidal streams were removed because they would not be suppliers of sediment or oxygenated, estuarine-salinity water to the surrounding marsh surface. The tidal creek hypothesis is based on the view that creeks supply nutrients, sediment and flushing to the marsh. Bodies of water that are not connected to the tidal creek network (or that are only marginally connected) would not be expected to supply incoming tidal water at sufficient velocity to carry sediments to the surrounding marsh surface, if, indeed, they flush the marsh surface at all. However, they were left in the road and upland mask files, because they would still act as barriers to hydrological impacts. Each effect type, due to the grid cell size, has a minimum thickness of 28.5 meters."}, {"section_title": "Distance upstream:", "text": "Distance upstream was calculated in three steps, excluding the creation of various masks. The first step was to determine the furthest point downstream. This was determined in a somewhat subjective manner by drawing a line that roughly paralleled the shoreline, with the exception of river mouths were it was drawn as a straight line (Figure 12). On areas such as the Outer Banks, the line went almost completely around the barrier islands. The purpose of this line was to establish a reference that represented a hydrostatic minimum for the adjacent land and waterways. Once the baseline downstream position was determined, it was converted to a grid, along with a mask of the shoreline including a cost grid. The ESRI function costdistance was then used to calculate the distance to every grid cell upstream within the river and creek boundaries from the nearest point on the downstream line for a line following the tidal creeks. To assign a value to pixels in the marsh a similar mask was applied and the eucdistance function was applied. This function applies the nearest value from a mask (the river and stream edges, in this case) to each cell in the output grid. The results of this are shown in Figure 12. Before running the costdistance function, the streams were clipped wherever they became only 1 pixel wide. This served to eliminate ponds that were attached to the main channel by a narrow creek, as well as narrow meandering creeks."}, {"section_title": "Distance from nearest tidal creek:", "text": "The NWI data were used to define all tidal creeks. First, a mask was created showing areas on the marsh surface that were water, road or upland (streammask2.aml). Then the water_process.aml was run. The upstream distance calculation was used as the beginning of this operation. The clipping of small channels and calculation of upstream distances allowed easy removal of many interior ponds. Those not visibly connected with a channel or that were clipped off, simply had no distance upstream calculated and could be removed. The algorithm after that is much more convoluted and is included in whole in Appendix C. Once tidal creeks were defined, the distance from each point in the marsh to the nearest creek had to be calculated. The output of water_process.aml is a file called allcreeks, which is an attempt to remove ponds while leaving as much of the creek system as possible. The possibility of doing this by hand was examined, but discarded because of the hugely subjective interpretation it creates. Allcreeks was used with a cost grid to create the distance grid. For creeks it was determined that their influence would end at other water bodies, roads or uplands. None of the amls turned out to be complete, so some manipulation by hand was undertaken at the completion of some of the amls. These steps were kept the same and are outlined in the \"Processing Steps for All Input Grids\" section of Appendix C."}, {"section_title": "Distance from nearest road:", "text": "The road distance calculation also started with the creation of a mask. This mask process was designed to differentiate between roads that crossed marshes and those that merely touched them. The first step was to identify all road segments that touched a marsh. The second step was to eliminate those that coincided with upland or that merely came to the marsh edge and ended there. This mask was then used as input to a number of functions. For the road distance calculation, the next step is \"road_process.aml\". This aml further processes the mask and attempts to differentiate between roads that impede water flow and those that do not. This step was necessary as the hypothesis was based on the assumption that roads affect hydrology. Those that do not affect hydrology are of no interest in this analysis. In brief, a costgrid is created in which each water pixel has a resistance value of 1 and each marsh pixel was assigned a resistance of 100. The value of 100 was chosen after trying several different values for resistance to flow across the marsh. This value caused the model water flow to stay within the creek banks more rather than flowing long distances over the marsh to reach a pixel. This allowed an approximation of a flow distance to be calculated. The costdistance function always calculates the least cost path. In this case, there will be a trade off between coming farther upstream versus calculating across diagonals of the marsh pixels. The costdistance will be minimized somewhere between Distance = Nwater + Nmarsh * 100 And Distance = (N -Y)water + (Y2 + Nmarsh2)1/2 * 100 Where Nwater refers to the distance upstream to the stream point nearest the marsh pixel in units of pixels. The Nmarsh is the number of pixels in the shortest distance from the marsh pixel to the water and N -Y is the distance along a stream that would give the shortest costdistance to the marsh pixel in question if traversing marsh and traversing water had the same cost. This also assumes, for simplicity, a relatively straight stream, which is not likely in a marsh. This formulation simulates the flow of tidal water in and out of the marsh, by assuming that flood tide water reaching a point in the marsh will get there by the least cost path. Use of this function allows the algorithm to determine which roads impede the flow of water by comparing the costdistance to pixels on either side of the road. After some examination of the data in the test zone, a difference of 13,000 was found to be effective in separating the roads into two categories. This value implies an actual difference of 4.5 pixels traversed. The actual calculation was accomplished by placing a 5x5 window over each grid cell that contains road surface, and then comparing the minimum and maximum values. The expected maximum difference (maximum -minimum), if the water is flowing parallel to the road on both sides, would be 28.5 * 4 * 100 (width of a pixel, times 4 pixels, times the resistance due to traveling over ground). If the road runs diagonal to all the pixels, it may get included as having an effect because the diagonal maximum difference expected would be 16,207, or slightly larger than the cutoff value in some cases. However, making the cutoff larger would also exclude road segments that should be included. The road cost grid was defined by assuming that the influence of a road, being primarily hydrological in nature, would end at another road, stream or upland area. These areas were set to NULL, which terminates the cost function calculation in that direction."}, {"section_title": "Distance from nearest upland", "text": "The landmask was created by reassigning the CMP marsh upland category a value of 1 and all other categories a value of NULL.

In Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, for example, the marsh substrate clearly thins as you approach the various islands, much as the water around an island gets shallower closer to shore.

One way to do this was simply to use the percent water in each pixel as the dependent variable. However, according to the original formulation of the MSCI, a certain amount of open water is good in a healthy marsh. There will be small ponds creeks. Furthermore, small amounts of water on the marsh may be a result of recent rain events or simply the tide being high at the time of the data collection. Therefore, the numbers at the low end of the scale were not meaningful. Only about 2 -5% of the marsh exceeded 50% water in any given pixel, so at the high end of the scale, data were virtually non-existent. To be consistent with the Coastal Marsh Project analysis, any parcel estimated to be 50% or more open water was considered \"totally degraded\" or \"open water\" for the purposes of this research. All other pixels were considered to be \"not totally degraded\"."}, {"section_title": "Testing the Individual Effects (Chapter 5)", "text": "The response variable being examined here is the probability of becoming open water, and was calculated as follows. For each effect type, (distance from a road, distance from upland, parcel size, etc.) the distances (or size of parcel) were normalized to a scale of 1 -100, and converted to integers to yield 100 categories (this was represented by an integer grid containing the values 1 -100). In ArcInfo terminology, a zone is defined as a set of grid cells all having the same value, whether or not they are contiguous, therefore each integer value defines a zone. For each zone, the number of cells in category 4 (totally degraded) was calculated as well as the zonal area. From this the probability of a point in the marsh becoming open water could be calculated from: P = area degraded / total area in zone. The normalized distances and the probabilities were then converted to natural logarithms and plots were made of the regression of the probabilities on the distances. This explains why the distances were scaled from 1 -100, instead of 0 -100, as zero has no natural log. The distance from land zones are shown in Figure 13 where g() accounts for other factors in the number of cells, y is the total number of cells in a zone, x is distance, and the definite integral over dx is implied. Therefore, y = g(ln(x)). Defining the zones on equal widths of ln(distance) tends to redistribute the number of cells per zone more normally. Because total degradation is a rare condition, based on the total marsh surface area, the distribution of probability values will tend to follow a non-Gaussian distribution, also. In particular, they will tend to follow an e-x distribution, which can also be corrected to a Gaussian distribution by the natural logarithm function."}, {"section_title": "Statistics: Chapter 5 Autocorrelation", "text": "When dealing with spatial data, the question of autocorrelation becomes important. Cliff and Ord (1973) define spatial autocorrelation as \"If the presence of some quantity in a county (sampling unit) makes its presence in neighboring counties (sampling units) more or less likely, we say that the phenomenon exhibits spatial autocorrelation\". Anselin (1988) and Davis (2003)  is a vector of parameters for the exogenous variable matrix, X, is the coefficient of the spatially lagged dependent variable, y, and is a, possibly autocorrelated, disturbance term. W is the weight matrix (Anselin, 1988). For this analysis, the W matrix may be thought to contain several interpretable influences (the subjects of the hypotheses) plus others that are not known. Particularly, in the presence of a road, where y = p(deterioration), the weight matrix values would be hypothesized to increase as the distance from the road increased, if that were the only influence. Several factors may be in operation in a given area. To extract the one of interest, the data are organized by the effect being studied. This essentially becomes an exercise in signal extraction. By summing the data in a way to emphasize the signal of interest and to average the rest, the signal of interest will be amplified and noncorrelated inputs (noise) will be reduced by the averaging. This applies both to the other influences in the W 1 matrix, as well as the exogenous inputs included in X . Any autocorrelation due to measurement error has been reduced through resampling of the original data, atmospheric and solar angle correction, and the NDXI technique, which tends to reduce between-band autocorrelation. The possibility of endogeniety arises with the regression of distance from roads on marsh health. Roads are likely to be built where the surface or subsurface is solid.

To insure a high probability of a pure pixel for any of the three surface cover types, and evenly distribute the potential for any one cover type to be either high or low in any given pixel, they were calculated by first generating a random variable, x1, that was between 0 and 1. where the e's represent random variation in the endmembers and ' sisi represent the bright and dark soil spectra, s wi , and s vi represent standard deviations of water and vegetation, and wi and vi represent the reflectances of water and vegetation. The non-linear model used is a modification of one of the models of Borel and Gerstl (1994). Borel and Gerstl's model incorporated one cover type (soil) beneath the vegetation. This model allows the substrate to vary between 100% soil and 100% water in each pixel. As a first-order approximation, each pixel in this model is treated as though the mixture of soil and water is completely homogeneous and constant across the pixel. The reflectance immediately above the leaf layer is given by: The individual components R v and R g are given by: where ws = w f w /(f w +f s ) + s f s /(f w +f s ). R v and R g represent the reflectances of the leaf layer and the substrate, is the transmissivity of the leaf layer, f v is equal to LAI (Leaf Area Index) for LAI less than 1, ws is the average reflectance of water and soil in any pixel. Borel and Gerstl (1994) also modeled reflectance for LAI 1, but that model was not applied here. Datasets of ten thousand points were created using the non-linear model and unmixed using PCI's unmix algorithm with two different procedures. In one procedure, the principal components were calculated, endmembers selected in PCA space, and then the endmembers were used in TM space to unmix the pixels using bands 3, 4, and 5. This is referred to as the \"PCA\" procedure. The second procedure was to run the NDX transformation on TM bands 3, 4 and 5, use the NDWI and the NDSI to select endmembers and then unmix the data in the NDX data space (referred to as the NDX procedure)."}, {"section_title": "Identification of endmembers from real images was undertaken using PCI's", "text": "Imageworks\u00ae and EASI/PACE\u00ae programs. When using principal components, the first two principal components of the dataset were calculated and a scatterplot made of them. The points in the two-dimensional scatterplots representing water, soil and vegetation were identified at the extrema of the data, flagged, and the actual pixel locations identified. These pixels were used as training sites to create spectra for the three endmembers. The reflectance data were then unmixed using PCI's unmix algorithm (Gong et al. 1991) and subsequent analysis performed with SAS-JMP\u00ae. The unmix program uses singular value decomposition to solve for the unknown percentage cover fractions. For the NDX operation, a set of standard endmembers were extracted from actual scenes and applied across all synthetic datasets. To examine the effects of non-linear mixing directly on the data, one set of 498 points was generated with reflectances calculated both with and without nonlinear mixing. No random variations were permitted in this dataset, so that only the difference between linear and non-linear mixing could be examined. Non-linear reflectance in water or soils was not modeled because the spectral bands chosen have very little reflectance from water, except Band 3. The latter band may penetrate sufficiently into water to produce significant backscatter from bottom sediments. However, detection of water depends on Band 3 being brighter than Bands 4 and 5, which should make the water look more like water in the NDXI transformation. This is important because if the reflectance is sufficiently bright in Band 3, it may cause a pixel to appear like more than 100% water."}, {"section_title": "Real Data", "text": "The method of defining endmembers used here is similar to that of Williamson (1994), who used PCA, the spectral distribution of the reflectance data and ground reference data to select endmembers. The points representing endmembers were carefully screened after being selected in two-dimensional scatterplots. They were all examined spectrally to determine the degree to which they fit expectations for the various spectra, and they were also examined geographically within the context of the image. Water and vegetation pixels were relatively easy to find, as large expanses of open water and forests characterized most of the images. By comparison, soil spectra were a little more difficult to obtain. Sandy beaches provided the one ready source; the rest had to be carefully examined. Knowledge of the area being examined was used to support choices of individual pixels. It was found that even for the PCA method, the quickest way to identify potential endmembers accurately was to use plots of NDWI versus NDSI. Pixels flagged by this method could be used to find and identify the training pixels in the PCA space. A subset of 67,600 points was extracted from an atmospherically corrected Thematic Mapper Scene, 16/37 1992, and used either as TM image data or transformed according to the NDX algorithms above. Two sets of one thousand random points were selected from this subscene. The first set was truly random, but did not have many soil-dominated pixels. The second set was weighted, based on their spectra, to contain more soil-dominated pixels. The preliminary field validation and image processing used to provide the data here are discussed in Kearney et al. (1995). Ground reference data were collected in Blackwater NWR, Maryland, and Winyah Bay, South Carolina, by visually assessing areas on the ground and estimating the percentage water. The assessed locations were geographically located with GPS and then referenced back to the analyzed images. To determine whether the transformed TM data would scale spatially or not several TM scenes were tested. For the first half of the test, each NDX value was calculated and then the pixel values averaged together in 10 by 10 squares to get the following equation: Alternatively, the TM pixel values were averaged in 10 by 10 squares and subsequently transformed into NDX axes for the following equation:  The results of these two transformations were then regressed against each other to show that the NDX results scale with changes in geographic extent (Rogers and Kearney, 2004). The preceding discussion covers work that was done for the Coastal Marsh Project from 1992 -1996 as well as work that was done strictly by the author in the period 1996 to the present.      Figure 14 shows the data actually used to calculate the probabilities of total deterioration. The descriptive text associated with Figure 14 is based on the Marsh Surface Condition Index, which in turn is based on how estuarine marshes are thought to deteriorate (Kearney et al., 1988). This may have nothing to do with backbarrier island marshes or those on the far side of Currituck Sound, which are barely separated from the open ocean by a thin chain of islands. The back barrier marshes may also be stable with much higher amounts of open water in ponds and streams than the estuarine marsh systems. In addition, marshes that are developing may look exactly like marshes that are disappearing in remotely sensed data. However, for purposes of this discussion, the terms deteriorated and degraded will be applied to both marsh systems to denote marshes that have become 50% open water after the delineation of the NWI data. Coastal marshes under consideration are those classified as \"estuarine intertidal\" and subclassified as either emergent or scrub-shrub (Cowardin et al., 1979) by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI)."}, {"section_title": "Validation", "text": "Limited new validation of the Coastal Marsh Project dataset was done. However, the original validation is very encouraging as to the accuracy of this analysis.

This analysis compares the percent water calculated by the remote sensing model with percent water observed by analysis of aerial photographs, which was backed up with visits to ground sites. For a two-level classification (Table 6) the accuracy is nearly 100%. Other efforts have further validated the work . "}, {"section_title": "Hypothesis 0. (Random points as causes of marsh loss)", "text": "Before examining the stated hypotheses, the results of using randomly assigned pixels as an effect needs to be addressed. Figure 15 shows a clear relationship between probability of marsh loss and distance from randomly chosen points. What Figure 15 demonstrates is that the distribution of degraded pixels is clumpy and that they are rare. Because total degradation is a rare event, (approximately 5% of the pixels are degraded) any randomly chosen location is likely to be far away from a degraded pixel. This graph has three notable sections. From 0 to about 100 meters there is no strong trend. From about 100 meters to 300 meters, there is a strong increase in probability of degradation (p(degradation)). After that point, there is very little continuing relationship. Three kilometers is the maximum distance possible from one of these random points in the marsh. This was tested on the Atlantic Coast marshes."}, {"section_title": "Hypothesis 1. (Roads as causes of marsh loss)", "text": "The probability of a parcel being completely open water will be negatively related to the distance of the parcel from a road, with the caveat that close to the road the marsh may be healthy for the reasons stated in Chapter 1. Therefore, the deleterious impact may be expected to start some distance from the road. This was tested on both the Atlantic Coastal region and the Bay Area. Regressions of the data for this hypothesis are shown in Figure 16 and Figure 17. In both Figure 16 and Figure 17, the marsh nearest the road is the least likely to have degraded in the recent past. Contrasting Figure 16 and Figure 17 with Figure   15, p(degradation) increases immediately adjacent to the road but not next to the random pixels. The pattern remains coherent to a distance of 3 km in both Figure 16 and Figure 17, but this probably is because it is possible to be farther from a road in the marsh, then it is to be from one of the randomly chosen pixels. Overall, the regression of probability of marsh loss on distance from roads in the bay area does not look significantly different from the random effects in Figure 15, except that the R 2 is lower. It also directly refutes the hypothesis. "}, {"section_title": "Bay Area", "text": "For the bays, the distance to maximum degradation is about 400 meters.  Figure 18, the two lines mark the beginning and the end of the plateau in Figure 16. There seems to be some impact up to about three kilometers. After that, the graph ( Figure 16) no longer forms a coherent line, although there is still a strong increase in marsh degradation with distance. Figure 18 and Figure 20 map the wide swings in probability of loss after that distance. Figure 19 is the same area as Figure 18, but in this figure the marsh health index is shown. The two-hatched boxes represent the approximate bounds of the data \"plateau\". The box to the east of Shorter's Wharf Road clearly captures the bulk of the recent marsh loss in that direction. There is less loss to the west of the road, but much of it is captured by the box on that side. Just to the west of this map, however, is a large area of marsh loss in the midst of the lake in BNWR. This probably accounts in part for the scatter towards the right side of the graph in Figure 16. Figure 17 shows a similar result with marsh health decreasing with distance from the road until a dramatic shift in probability of loss at about 3 km. It is quite tempting to attribute this result to the same factors as in the bays. However, an examination of the available data leads to the conclusion that this is a result of other correlates discussed below. Typically, they have much more of their total edge open to a large body of water than the estuarine marshes of the bays. This means that is unlikely for hydrological impacts from a road to spread very far. The transect along the small island in Figure   21 makes this point.\nTaking the bay area first (Figure 30), there is a general trend toward decreased degradation going from the downstream extreme of each river system to the farthest reach of estuarine marsh. An overview of the entire area ( Figure 31) shows that the pattern is followed closely in areas near to the shore. The rivers of the Chesapeake Bay, which are much longer than those of the Delaware Bay, show a repeated fluctuation in degradation with increased distance upstream. Certainly, there are fluctuations in every river system; however, that these fluctuations make a consistent pattern, rather than averaging to the mean line, indicates that there is potentially some driver that operates on many river systems, such as where the maximum tidal sediment delivery occurs. Figure 32 compares the conditions at several upstream distances on the Choptank and Nanticoke Rivers. The wide disparity in river lengths allows the Potomac River to dominate the entire pattern for any distances over about 70 kilometers. In other cases, there is no expectation that there will be real impacts at distances of 70 or more kilometers with many of the effects being studied in this paper. However, in this case the effect is caused by the rivers as they import both tidal water and fresh water to the borders of the wetlands. Therefore, impacts can be reasonably connected to the effect of distance upstream. However, when only one river system is involved, it hardly poses any general effects. Furthermore, as the mean is driven by fewer and fewer actual marsh parcels, the data cease forming a coherent line.\nThere is a strong regression of ln(probability of being open water) on ln(distance from an upland area. The first point ( Figure 35) probably reflects edge error artifacts, and that point could have been omitted from the regression as an outlier. A cursory glance at Figure 36 shows how clear this effect is. The BNWR, Nanticoke River area, and the marsh islands all stand out in this map, which is correct, as they are hotspots of marsh loss. The marshes along the York River ( Figure   37) show that this loss is focused on either the seaward edge or interior of the marsh.\nThe regression here is much less clear (5-27). The data clearly suggests that there is a little trend up to about e10 meters or 22 hectares, after which the trend is toward more deterioration with increasing size. This is likely driven by interior ponding, which increases as the marsh interior gets farther from the edge. The distribution of these marshes around the bay area is much different from for the other effects ( Figure 42). The previous effects tended to show up in bands. The large tract of marsh south of BNWR is assessed as very healthy, which it is, and the peninsula between the Nanticoke River and Fishing Bay is assessed to be moderately deteriorated, which is same assessment as made by the Coastal Marsh Project data, although parts of it are heavily degraded.\nThe maps ( Figure 45) are focused on the area including BNWR and the Nanticoke River. Common features include peninsula west of the Nanticoke River being classified as moderately likely to be degraded. The area in BNWR that features a large number of degraded points in the CMP map is consistently classified as degraded. The Wingate area has a variety of classifications, but in most cases it is classified as less likely to be degraded than the area of BNWR. Similarly, the area west of BNWR has a variety of classifications, but is consistently healthier than BNWR and is about the same as Wingate."}, {"section_title": "Atlantic Coast", "text": "The roads in the Atlantic Coast area themselves are different in that they are usually closely associated with upland areas so it is quite natural that the marsh will be healthy near the road. Presumably, the road was built there because the marsh was stable. In Figure 22, there are numerous roads with marsh on both sides connecting the mainland and the barrier islands between Cape May and Great Egg Harbor. Examination of aerial photos and USGS orthophotoquads indicates that there may be more marsh present than is seen in the Coastal Marsh Project/NWI dataset. However, the roads do form points of stability in the marsh so the marsh immediately adjacent to them is healthy. This is an area heavily managed by humans, so the result may not be incidental. Because the marshes are healthy near the roads, it then must follow that degraded areas are going to be further away and this will produce the trend seen in Figure 17.  to water movement and therefore, even though the roads cross the marsh upstream, they would not be shown to impact the ebb and flow of tidal waters. An additional complication of the method is that there is an inherent decrease in the amount of data available at longer distances. Every grid cell on a road has at least one and possibly two grid cells in the surrounding marsh that are closer to it than to any other grid cell on the road. This means that for extreme distances only a few marshes, or perhaps one, will dominate the characterization of the marsh. In this case, the marsh on Great Egg Harbor and two in North Carolina seem to dominate this measurement.\nThe data for the Atlantic Coast support the hypothesis that distance upstream impacts marsh health (Figure 33). The regression closely resembles the regression for the bay areas. The narrowness of the Atlantic marshes and nearness to sea level, however, puts most of them in the category of high probability of being open water ( Figure 34) based on effect of distance upstream. The marsh systems up some river systems are likely to be healthy based on this factor. Because the barrier islands force Currituck Sound and Chincoteague Bay to be long and narrow, the back-barrier marshes will appear to be upstream from the inlets through the barrier islands. The upstream assessment indicates that marshes that are farther upstream are likely to be healthy.\nOf the effects examined in this paper, this is one of the most important for the Atlantic Coast (Figure 38). Like the bay area marshes, this effect ends at approximately 3 km, meaning that 3 km is the longest distance you can go in a coastal marsh from an upland area. There is an interesting result at about 500 meters, where the steady increase in deterioration is suddenly reversed briefly. This is especially interesting because it matches a similar feature in Figure 27. This is the distance from the edge to the center of many of the small back barrier marshes and it seems to represent the upper size limit for many of the Atlantic Coast marshes. In Figure 39, the general location of the most deteriorated marshes can be seen. Besides the usual locations at Great Egg Harbor and near Cape Lookout, there is a major area of deterioration north of Cape Charles. Close examination of this marsh system (Figure 40) shows that any point there has a very high probability of being open water. The very high probability value of -0.000042 likely reflects the tip of a single marsh that is heavily degraded.\nThe Atlantic Coast shows a more pronounced shift from low probability of deterioration, to a high level at mid-sized marshes (162 hectares) and then drops precipitously again (Figure 43). In contrast to the Bay area marshes, most of the Atlantic marshes fall in the low probability of deterioration category (Figure 44). Notable exceptions are the area north of Cape May and the area near Cape Lookout and Cape Hatteras. These areas seem to show up relatively often.\nThis area of the outer banks ( Figure 46) is shown in fine detail. The areas labeled A, B, and C tend to be the focus of degradation, although the exact pattern varies. The marsh at C is clearly highly degraded, but only shows up in some scenes. The south end of marsh B is also highly degraded (as shown by the concentration of magenta points in the CMP frame) and is consistently assessed to be degraded in the other views. The water effect is clearly not consistent with the other map views, because the model shows degradation around the water's edge of all these marshes, whether or not the marsh shows deterioration overall."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion to Hypothesis 1", "text": "The evidence for the estuarine marshes of the Delaware and Chesapeake Bays does not support the hypothesis and are indistinguishable from random inputs. For the Atlantic coast marshes, the evidence would suggest that roads do not have any demonstrable negative impact on the surrounding marshes and may serve to stabilize them."}, {"section_title": "Hypothesis 2. (Distance from large tidal streams)", "text": "The probability of a parcel being completely open water will be positively related to the distance of the parcel from the nearest tidal creek. Tidal creeks were defined as those that occupied in excess of one pixel width for their entire length and were present in the NWI data. Bay Area Figure 23 shows two strong trends. At the immediate creek edge, the marsh is more degraded and p(degradation) drops quickly for about 150 meters. Immediately next to the water body, this is probably an artifact of misregistration and the impossibility of spectrally distinguishing the water in the river from ponds on the marsh. Often there are degraded areas immediately behind the levee of a river, and these may be responsible for the higher level of degradation at 50 -100 meters from the creek edge. From 250 meters to 3 km the anticipated increase in p(degradation) toward the interior of the marsh occurs. The two regression lines drawn represent the two independent processes operating on marsh degradation with respect to sources of water. After 3 km, there is no longer a discernible pattern. Figure 24 shows the pattern of calculated degradation for the entire two bay area. Predictably, BNWR appears as a very degraded area. In Figure 25 and Figure 26, the tidal stream effectsrelated loss can be compared directly to the Coastal Marsh Project output. There is a good deal of correspondence, particularly in the upper reaches of the streams. It is not expected that there would be a perfect match. Atlantic Coast Figure 27 shows the result of regressing the ln(probability of being open water) on the ln(distance from the nearest tidal creek or water source). This is a very strong regression, showing continual declines in p(degradation) over the entire breadth of the marsh. This graph shows quite powerfully that Figure 15 is not the only possible outcome and that real effects are being detected. The Atlantic Coast marshes appear very wet at the edges and get healthier going inland for about 800 meters, on average. This does not agree with the hypothesis. The bulk of the marshes in this category have their edges almost entirely exposed to open bays rather than tidal streams, or other wetlands or uplands (Figure 28). This large exposure means that areas being actively eroded, plus edge placement error will account for much of the marsh degradation. The tidal regimes tend to be different for these marshes as well, with the tidal ranges being somewhat higher along the ocean coast (Appendix B). The marshes therefore have fewer tidal streams with levees per unit area, relative to the amount of higher energy tides, than the inland marshes of the bay area. A close up of the North Carolina coast south of Cape Lookout shows more clearly what is happening in these coastal marshes (Figure 29). The distance from the edge to the center of the largest marsh (center of map) is approximately 800 meters. In fact, the distance from the edge to center of many of these marshes tends to be in the 0.5 to 3 km range. The next range of distances appears to be dominated by some extreme areas in the Great Egg Harbor area."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The hypothesis is supported for the bay area, but is rejected for the Atlantic Coastal area. This may be related to the fact that the Atlantic Coast marshes are substantially different from the Chesapeake and Delaware marshes in size, tidal creek development and exposure to edge erosion.\nThe hypothesis that marsh health is related to distance upstream is supported for both systems. This conclusion also supports the hypothesis that sea level rise is a driving factor in marsh loss.\nThe hypothesis that distance from upland is strongly correlated with marsh loss is strongly supported for both systems.\nThe evidence given in the preceding sections supports the data in Table 7. This kind of signal processing technique clearly produces regressions that indicate that most of the effects studied have consistent, demonstrable influences on coastal marshes, whether in the major bays or on the Atlantic Coast. This does not, however, make them particularly good assessors individually because there is too much variability introduced by the other factors. Having shown that there are individual influences, the next step is to combine them into a model. The effects as studied here cannot, however, be put directly into a model because the response variable is calculated by zones defined by the test variable. Therefore, each response variable is unique to its test and they cannot be combined. In Chapter 6, a model will be discussed that does use a single response variable.  This graph shows the increase in probability of degradation with distance from a set of randomly selected points in the marshes. This graph shows the increase in probability of degradation with distance from the nearest road.                 This is the analog of the distance from tidal creeks in the bays. Loss here seems to be driven more by distance from the ocean shore than by distance from tidal creeks.                 This figure shows the relationship between the size of a marsh parcel and the probability that any pixel in it will be degraded.       \nThe logistic regression clearly shows that the elements identified in the five original hypotheses, plus the factors added in this chapter, can model marsh loss to a limited extent. The accuracy is far better than would be expected from chance alone.       Table 14 below. The results in Chapter 5 indicate that there is a very strong signal exerted upon marsh loss by some of the five landscape factors examined. When combined, these same factors model the marsh loss reasonably well. While it is not a surprise that landscape factors impact marsh development and loss, these particular measures are of some interest. The work of the Coastal Marsh Loss project was based on the Marsh Surface Condition Index, which was based on studies of the Nanticoke River estuary and other marshes on the Chesapeake Bay. These microtidal systems are different from the meso and macrotidal regions of the Atlantic Coast. The MSCI may not be meaningful in these areas. The Coastal Marsh Project data used here are affected by this. Although the remote sensing algorithm was shown to be accurate (Stevens, 1997), it is not clear what the amount of water on the marsh surface means in some areas. For example, the categories were determined to be accurately assessed for microtidal areas because the tide never got high enough to make healthy areas of the marsh look degraded. This is clearly not the case for areas where the tidal range is in excess of a meter and can cover short plants such as Wilmington, North Carolina. In these areas a presumption has to be made that most of the area was not at high tide during the time of acquisition."}, {"section_title": "Hypothesis 3. (Distance upstream as a cause of loss)", "text": "The probability of a parcel being completely open water will be negatively related to the distance the upstream of the marsh system that contains the parcel.

For the purposes of this study, although the term upland is used, in actuality it is distance from whatever is in the \"other\" (see map legends) class that could be anything except for the wetland type under consideration. Much of the estuarine marsh in BNWR borders on forested swampland. This will be different from upland, but it will provide two of the effects of upland that are postulated here to benefit marshes. First, swamps can act as a source of freshwater to the downstream marsh. Secondly, as the swamp substrate is solid enough to support trees, it must be reasonably stable. The distance to the nearest upland could have been calculated using the uplands and measuring across the freshwater swamps and marshes, but this study was more interested in what was happening in the estuarine marshes. Therefore, the bounds of the data in the Coastal Marsh Project were used as the marsh boundaries."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion**", "text": "The hypothesis that probability of being open water will decrease with increasing marsh size is clearly not supported. This hypothesis, however, was included to test whether studies done in one size of a marsh would be applicable to marshes of different sizes.

Before moving to creating a model, it is useful to know how the models relate to each other. In examining Figure   45 and Figure 46, a few caveats are in order. The five effects measured here are grouping broad areas of the study area together and calculating an expected value for the entire category. Although some places may be expected to have similar probabilities of being open water under different effects, the likelihood that there will be an exact correspondence is low. Second, although all the scales run from low probability to high probability, the maximum and minimum for each effect is unique, so an actual equal probability of deterioration may be colored differently for different effects. In addition, not every area of marsh is connected to a road. Areas that are not directly connected to a road will not be represented on the map showing road effects. The data for each study area is arranged in 6 windows. The first window is the Coastal Marsh Project data reduced to a categorization of either totally degraded (magenta) or not totally degraded (green). This is the data on which all the rest of the analysis in this chapter is based. Each of the other windows has a key word to identify the effect being represented and they are arranged (left to right, top to bottom) in the same sequence as in the preceding discussion."}, {"section_title": "Summary of Fit", "text": "\n"}, {"section_title": "Additional Variables", "text": "In this chapter several additional independent variables are introduced -sea level rise, mean tide range, UTM northings and eastings. Relative sea level rise is, of course, one of the factors that would cause marsh loss directly. NOAA records a number of tidal data for various points, but the mean range was chosen because it represents the hydroperiod that most of a marsh will be experience better than other measures. Easting and northing were included as proxies for any environmental conditions that might be keyed to geography such as temperature changes on a north-south axis. Sea level rise and tides were not formally included in a hypothesis but were included as possible additional factors. However, given the data available, these factors turn out to have only slight relevance (Table 8) for the bay areas. Given the low R 2 values of either factor in the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays in the bay landscape model, they were not used in further analysis. This low correspondence was probably because the tidal and sea level rise data are for the coastal regions, but most of the bay area marshes are upstream and inland. Tides, in particular, are sensitive to many things so that the coastal tides may not accurately represent local inland tides. Also, the high degree of spatial variation in tidal range may not be well mirrored in the available tide gauge records (Kearney, pers. com.). Similarly, if relative sea level rise is a result of eustatic sea level rise and land subsidence, erosion or accretion, then the sea level rise measured at a certain point may not accurately reflect the relative sea level rise in more inland areas. The regression parameters for all models are listed in Table 9."}, {"section_title": "Bay Area Model", "text": "The Bay Area landscape model had to be constructed in two pieces. The roads are modeled as only having an impact on parcels of marsh that they actually touch. Many areas of marsh are not actually touched by a road. Two separate models were run, one including the road factor and covering a smaller area, and one not including the road factor and covering a larger area. The two were then combined so that any areas not included in the road model would be added from the non-road model. Small areas of marsh were lost from the analysis because the data available at this scale did not show any connection between them and the major bodies of water. The major contributors to each principal component are shown in Table 10 and 11. The complete loadings and other information about the principal components analysis are in the Appendix D. These tables show that there is much similarity between the two models. For example, Model 1, PC 6 matches Model 2 PC 1. PC's 3, 4 and 5 in both models are very similar in terms of major loadings. Figure 47 compares the principal component five in each of the two bay models in their full extent. This component is dominated by distance from land. It is not possible to represent faithfully the full detail because smaller features are lost at this resolution. However, it can be seen that for areas that both cover, there is not a great deal of difference, but there are differences.  Table 10 and 11. Again, the models are very similar, but it can be seen that the areas covered by high values are larger in Model 2. Therefore, the distance from roads adds information to the regression. The results of the combined assessments are shown in Table 12. The results show that the model does identify the areas of degradation in the marsh -but not very accurately. However, considering that only 5% of the marsh is in the degraded category, then only 1.2% of the degraded marsh pixels and 70% of the healthy pixels would be assessed correctly. The results of this landscape model are much better than that. The significance of the model results are shown in Table 9 The global result for the Bay model is shown in Figure 49. The Bay area landscape model is compared with the full range of the CMP model here for several reasons. The CMP model was most developed and most heavily validated in this region. The areas that the landscape model mischaracterizes as being totally lost can also be interpreted as \"predicted to be lost\". As most of the mischaracterization involves pixels that the CMP had designated as partly or severely degraded, this makes sense. Some of the results can be examined in detail in Figure 50 and Figure 51. In the BNWR area, several areas are mischaracterized by the landscape model. In particular, the tip of the peninsula between Fishing Bay and the Nanticoke River appears much more degraded in the landscape model than in the CMP data, with other mismatched areas scattered over the map. In one sense, these may be errors, but in looking at it as a predictive model, the area by the Nanticoke River (area A) is certainly at high risk. There are numerous creeks and internal ponding already is in progress. In Areas B and C, the same thing is true. Although the CMP data classifies many areas of the marsh as healthy, in among the healthy patches of marsh are distributed many ponds and creeks, which could lead to further deterioration. The same reasoning could apply to the large parts of Area D that are characterized as degraded by the landscape model, but do not look degraded in the CMP data. However, from an overall perspective, given the uncertainties of the model, it is noteworthy most areas are correctly classified by the landscape model. "}, {"section_title": "Atlantic Model", "text": "The Atlantic Coast model did not need to be run in pieces as roads were omitted and all other factors were assumed to be global in nature. These marshes tend to exist in a relatively narrow band parallel to the coast, therefore assuming that the factors are global in nature is reasonable. This narrowness also may explain why sea level rise and mean tides had a measurable (though still minute) correlation in the Atlantic coastal region but not in the bay area. The results of the landscape model are compared with the CMP data in Figures   Figure 52, Figure 53, Figure 54 and Table 13. These data are not compared with all the categories in the CMP data as the bay data were. The CMP model of marsh evolution was designed for low-energy, protected areas such as the Chesapeake Bay, not for higher energy environments such as Winyah Bay, South Carolina, where the tides can rise 4 meters. On the Atlantic Coast, while roughly 14% of the area is degraded, the model only assesses 3% to be degraded. This is more than likely a failure of calibration. It does indicate that the model is working, however. Given 14% and 3%, random chance would result in only 0.4% degraded marsh pixels correctly identified and only 83% of healthy pixels correctly assessed. The model results far exceed both those expectations. Moreover, of the areas assessed as degraded, 61% are, in fact, degraded and for healthy marsh assessments, 88% are correct. For anyone using this data to work in a marsh, there is a 0.87 probability that when they investigate an area, they will encounter what the model indicates. The Atlantic Model map (Figure 51) shows the Atlantic study area. Most of the area is in the less than 50% degraded category and is correctly classified. However, the second largest class represents areas that are actually more than 50% water, but are classified as healthy. Much of this area is transitional zones, a mixture of partly degraded areas with totally degraded areas. The areas shown here as greater than 50% open water were classified as intact marsh in the NWI. This means that there is a presumption that the areas classified as totally degraded do in fact represent loss of marsh. However, it cannot be presumed that the partly degraded areas are moving toward total loss because, unlike for the estuarine marshes, there is no model or tested data that concludes that there is a constant progression from healthy to partly deteriorated to completely deteriorated. In Figure 53, the general pattern can be seen in more detail on the Delmarva Peninsula. Figure 54 shows the area around Pamlico Sound, where there are also areas of complete loss that are characterized correctly."}, {"section_title": "Review of the Hypotheses", "text": "An additional hypothesis was tested, that degradation in the marsh should have no relation to distance from randomly selected points. The results from this test show that degradation is a rare event and clumped. It also gives a picture to compare or contrast with the other hypotheses. In particular, the marsh loss from roads in the Bay areas looks very similar to the pattern related to random points. The others do not. Also, most results that shared the same positive slope have much higher R 2 . The random hypothesis was only tested for the Atlantic Coast, but the result may have been similar for the Bay areas. This hypothesis was only to test whether or not other unmeasured factors could influence the regression and, if so, how. Hypothesis 1 states that the probability of a parcel being completely open water will be negatively related to the distance of the parcel from a road. The hypothesis that roads had a correlation with marsh loss on the Atlantic Coast marshes was rejected because it seemed to be more confounded with upland effects. The roads in the bay areas, on the other hand, are not so strongly tied to upland areas, because they are often built in submerging landscapes (i.e., Dorchester, Somerset and Wicomico counties in Maryland). The regressions involving the other factors all support the general hypothesis, even if the particular one-tailed tests failed. The results with distance from tidal creeks are a good example. Hypothesis 2 states that the probability of a parcel being completely open water will be positively related to the distance the parcel is from the nearest tidal creek or man-made ditch (e.g. mosquito ditches). For the Bay areas, the regression at short distances actually did not support the hypothesis. However, measured deterioration immediately adjacent to creeks is probably as much due to misregistration as it is to any actual losses on the ground. This may be augmented by the fact that in some locations, Bloodsworth Island, for example (Downs et al., 1994) , shoreline erosion is an important process. From about 150 meters to 2 km, there is a very strong trend (0.92 R 2 for that region) and the tendency toward increasing degradation continues to about 5 km, with some variations. This provides general support to the concept that the interiors of marshes are more degraded than the areas adjacent to tidal creeks or shores. The slope of this regression for the Atlantic Coast was diametrically opposed to the prediction. This may be related to the fact that the Atlantic Coast marshes tended to be smaller and, therefore, had less developed tidal creek systems that could bring nutrients into the interior of the marsh. Also, fully degraded areas tend to cluster along the coast. This could indicate that either the marshes in this system are eroding at the edge more than deteriorating at the center due to interior ponding. This would have some implications for comparing results of studies done in marshes in different coastal environments. For the Atlantic Coast shoreline erosion seems to be the only significant process indicated by this hypothesis test, and this seems to be a key difference between these systems. Hypothesis 3 states that the probability of a parcel being completely open water will be negatively related to the distance the marsh system containing the parcel is upstream. The regressions for upstream distance vs. degradation are not very strong, and the variations clearly have a cyclical component. However, this cyclicity may be a result of tidal flooding, which can be higher upstream than downstream. There is a fair amount of scatter, which may be related to the grossness of the measurement. The distance upstream was only measured for major rivers and creeks, and part of the presumption is that where freshwater meets brackish water, sediment will precipitate. This can occur anywhere along a river or major creek, where a smaller stream joins. However, the general trend supports the hypothesis in both regions. For the distance upstream, Hypothesis 3 was based, in part, on the fact that plant communities change with distance upstream and that relative sea level rise will alter marshes along a river by drowning the downstream marshes and killing species that are less tolerant to salt and anaerobic conditions further upstream. Because seawater is a source of sulfate ions, the seaward marshes on a river would tend to have high sulfide content, as anaerobic bacteria convert sulfate to sulfide, although high sulfide can occur in other areas. As both high salinity and high sulfide concentrations are generally toxic to plants (Koch et al., 1990), this would reduce the number of species able to survive in the more saline and high sulfide conditions at the seaward end of a river. In addition, anoxic conditions can limit plant growth (Anastasiou and Brooks, 2003). Coupled with higher inputs of sediment for the marshes closest to fresh water, this makes a coherent picture of the relationship seen between distance upstream and probability of marsh loss. Hypothesis 4 states that the probability of a parcel being completely open water will be positively related to the distance of the parcel from the upland. This hypothesis was strongly supported for both areas. Distance from uplands obviously, like the other variables, is a stand in for some other factors. One these factors may simply be elevation. If so, the distance from upland is a more useful measurement than elevation for studying large areas of wetlands. Elevation is extremely time consuming and difficult to measure for a sufficient number of points to build a good model of a marsh. Upland boundaries are mapped already, and only require mapping a single line at the edge of each marsh if a new datum is required. There are likely other factors involved as well, including sediment and nutrient supply, and freshwater runoff to reduce salinity. Hypothesis 5 states that the probability of a parcel being completely open water will be negatively related to the size of the marsh parcel containing the grid cell. This is naturally potentially confounded with hypotheses 2 and 4 as either upland or a creek will be the boundary of most marsh parcels. The results here are similar for both study areas, and there is a relationship between marsh loss and the size of the parcel. The relationship is a little hard to understand, however. If edge erosion, either shoreline or tidal creek bank, were the primary process, a regression with small parcels being at the most risk would be expected. This is because the ratio of edge to marsh area could be expected to decrease as parcel size increases, if the parcel is convex. If interior ponding is the primary mechanism of loss, then a regression showing large parcels as the most at risk would be expected because the ratio of area available for loss compared to the total size diminishes as the overall parcel size drops. If these two mechanisms operate together, it might be anticipated that large and small parcels would be the most at risk. However, in actuality the regression shows that for both study areas, the mid-size parcels are the most at risk. The midsize parcels at the most risk are about 2.2 hectares for the Bay Areas and 16.3 hectares for the Atlantic Coast. One possible explanation is that marsh loss probability as a function of interior ponding and the loss as a function of edge to interior ratio overlap. "}, {"section_title": "Primary drivers in marsh loss", "text": "The fact that the hypotheses are supported across landscapes and marsh types indicates that there is a great deal of consistency across these marshes. For example, the same primary factors -distance from land and distance upstream -impact both Atlantic Coast marshes and Chesapeake and Delaware Bay marshes, although the distances involved are different. This would indicate that the same drivers apply in both systems. These results raise several interesting questions. One question is in the area of defining the primary drivers in marsh loss. If the primary drivers are factors that are "}, {"section_title": "Management", "text": "The main result of this research is to show that marsh processes are influenced by events happening at the landscape scale. As noted previously, most marsh studies take place on very small scales. This may not be appropriate to understanding the function of salt and brackish marshes. The landscape model presented here cannot identify exact points of marsh loss. However, it may be possible to better identify where disintegration of a marsh will start, or which direction it will move using landscape parameters than local measurements of fluctuating sediment height. Some crucial management questions can be addressed with this model. Evers (1998) showed that in the absence of Nutria marshes will regrow. It would be useful to attempt to predict if this regeneration is likely to be long-term or short-lived. If marsh loss is mainly driven by its position in the landscape, then it may be preferable to build exclosures or take other measures to reduce Nutria impacts in areas where degradation is not predicted to occur for landscape reasons. If the landscape drivers only predispose an area to loss given the action of some other impact, then removing Nutria would be useful in preserving high-risk areas. For the Bay, the overall accuracy in correctly identifying pixels is 72%, with 37% of the degraded pixels correctly identified. On the flip side, of the pixels predicted to be degraded, only 7% were actually degraded. This means that a manager or researcher looking for degraded points in the marsh may have difficulty using these data, except that, as shown in Figure 50, the model tends to pick areas where degradation is occurring. Given this, the results would help in identifying areas of future loss. For the Atlantic Coast, the results are somewhat different. The model correctly identifies 14% of the degraded pixels. On the other hand, 60% of the pixels identified as degraded are, in fact, degraded. This means that the same manager going into an Atlantic Coast marsh looking for degraded pixels has a very high likelihood of finding one based on these data. The problem is reversed from the Bay area. On the Atlantic Coast, the problem would be finding more than a small percentage of the degraded pixels. The clumpiness of degradation would help with this, however. Because marsh loss is more likely in some places than others, finding some degraded points will lead the manager to associated degraded areas. The Bay area marshes seem to be impacted by the presence of roads, but this is not as strong a correlation as hoped. There are several possible reasons for this. One is that the effect is too localized. A second is that the marsh areas where roads are built may have been chosen because they were more stable areas to begin with and may be maintained by anthropological inputs of material and energy. In addition, some roads have culverts under them to allow drainage from one side to the other. Lastly, much of the damage in areas like BNWR was apparently done before the NWI data were collected, so that the major historical component of damage from roads was missed. The only other source of marsh loss examined here that is arguably anthropogenic in nature is sea level rise. Though it is difficult to know how much of sea level rise is actually anthropological in nature and how much has other causes, there is a growing consensus that the acceleration in the sea level rise since the early decades of the 20th century reflected anthropogenic global warming. An uncontrolled factor was allowed into the analysis by not differentiating between different types of land cover that border the marsh. As long as the land covers were not estuarine intertidal marsh, they were considered upland. Presumably, it makes a difference if the neighboring land cover is palustrine marsh, a swamp, an old sand dune, or a hill. Uplands were hypothesized to have an impact on the marsh both through hydrology and by providing stability. The amount of water flowing into a marsh from its landward edge may be more a result of climate than whatever land cover exists there, although the sediment and nutrient load and rate variability will be affected However, the stability provided will be less if the intervening non-estuarine wetland is large. This provides some degree of uncertainty in the results. However, adding in other cover types would have simply expanded the number of factors, but not necessarily added more information. Once done, most of the hard work of developing this model for an area does not need to be repeated. Additional factors could be added as new geographic layers at the resolution of 28.5 meters. For example, Nutria population density could be added and the statistical tests performed to determine the impact of this factor. One good question, especially from the management point of view, would be rates. Knowing that two areas are at equal risk of loss does not help much if the expected rates of loss are unknown. This research, ultimately based on the NWI, which is a variable starting point, does not have the possibility of giving rates. However, multiple images taken over 5 to ten year intervals, for example, 1984, 1989, 1994, 1999, and 2004 would give an excellent time series from which to derive rates. This would help with smoothing out errors caused by tidal fluctuations and weather events that can make an area look more degraded than it is. In Moreover, to accomplish this end, multiple scenes should be collected each year during the growing season. A decision tree approach might have produced more useful results and be easier to update. One way to go about this would be to start with marsh parcel size. This would allow a manager to see directly how different factors related to marsh health. For the type of decision tree shown in Figure 55 the data must be broken into categories. This process would help clarify the inputs and outputs. For example, the probability of degradation based on size of the marsh parcel can be divided into two groups. For the Atlantic Coast, those marsh pixels in a parcel that is between 1 and 500 hectares, have an approximately 0.16 probability of being degraded. Pixels in marsh parcels that are not in that size range have a much smaller likelihood of being degraded. Dividing the distance from upland into three categories yields the tree in the figure. From this it is very easy to see that areas within 100 meters of an upland that are in a small or large parcel are much less likely to be degraded than an area more than 1000 meters from the upland in a parcel between 1 and 500 hectares in size. .     1  2  3  4  5  6  7  Eigenvalues 1.8e-1 7.3e-2 1.0e-2 7.4e-3 5.4e-3 4. 6e-3 4.7e-4 Input Layer Eigenvectors Upstream 7.96e-5 2.18e-2 1.52e-1 4.20e-1 5.62e-1 6.96e-1 1.72e-2 Land 7.86e-4 4.25e-2 9.04e-1 2.35e-1 3.50e-1 5.34e-2 1.82e-2 SLR 10.00e-1 9.13e-3 6.29e-4 2.20e-3 2.48e-3 3.04e-3 9.79e-4 Tide 4.13e-4 1.76e-2 3.91e-1 7.82e-1 4.84e-1 4.89e-3 6.46e-3 Easting 1.36e-3 1.48e-2 7.23e-3 5.33e-2 7.74e-2 6.91e-2 9.93e-1 Northing 8.35e-3 5.00e-1 5.24e-2 3.32e-1 5.08e-1 6.09e-1 9.19e-2 Water 5.71e-3 8.64e-1 6.32e-2 2.08e-1 2.51e-1 3.72e-1 6.90e-2"}]
