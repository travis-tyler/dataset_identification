Over the next 25 years, cropland shifted away from midsize and toward larger operations. By 2012, farms with 100-999 acres held 36 percent of cropland, the same share as that held by large farms."}, {"section_title": "Embed this chart", "text": "Download higher resolution chart (2538 pixels by 2001, 300 dpi) That shift occurred persisently over time, as the share held by large farms increased in each Census of Agriculture after 1987Agriculture after -in 1992Agriculture after , 1997Agriculture after , 2002Agriculture after , 2007, and 2012-while the share held by farms with 100-999 acres fell in each census. Note that the share of cropland held by the smalles farms (with less than 100 acres) changed little over time, at about 8 percent of all cropland. Consolidation can occur through shifts in ownership, as operators of large farms purchase land from retiring operators of midsize farms. However, mos cropland is rented, and farms frequently expand by renting more cropland, often from retired farmers and their relatives, but sometimes from absentee invesors in farmland. Shifts of crop acreage to larger farms occurred in almos all crops. To track consolidation in specifc crops, we measured the midpoint acreage for selected crops in each census year. At the midpoint, half of all harvesed acres of the crop are on larger operations and half are on smaller. In 1987, for example, the midpoint for corn was 200 acres-half of all harvesed corn acres was on farms that harvesed at leas 200 acres of corn, and half was on farms that harvesed no more than 200 acres. The corn midpoint increased in every census after 1987. By 2012, it sood at 600 acres. Four other major feld crops (cotton, rice, soybeans, and wheat) showed a very similar pattern: the midpoint for harvesed acreage more than doubled for each crop between 1987 and 2012, and the midpoints increased persisently in each census year (with the single exception of a decline in cotton in 2007-12).\nDownload higher resolution chart (2538 pixels by 2196, 300 dpi) We repeated the analysis for 10 more feld crops and for 40 fruit, melon, tree nut, and vegetable crops-a total of 55 crops in all. Consolidation was nearly ubiquitous, as the midpoint increased in 53 of the 55 crops between 1987 and 2012. Consolidation was also subsantial, as mos of these midpoint increases were well over 100 percent, and it was persisent, as mos midpoints increased in mos census years.\nDownload higher resolution chart (2538 pixels by 1981, 300 dpi) U.S. farmland shows very little consolidation since the 1980s. However, that seeming sability refects two diverging underlying trends: considerable consolidation in cropland and in crop and livesock production, set agains shifts of pasure and rangeland toward smaller operations.\nDownload higher resolution chart (2538 pixels by 2228, 300 dpi) However, note that much of the consolidation in sales occurred between 1991 and 2007, and it appears to have slowed considerably afterwards. This fnding is consisent with the slowing of consolidation shown in mos livesock sectors, and also with slowing consolidation in some crops. However, esimates of farm profts derived from ARMS indicate that larger farms continue to realize better fnancial returns than smaller operations, so we cannot yet conclude that the apparent slowing is more than a pause."}, {"section_title": "Pasure and Rangeland Shifted to Smaller Operations", "text": "Cropland accounted for 43 percent of all U.S. farmland in 2012, while pasure and rangeland accounted for another 45 percent. While cropland consolidated into larger farms between 1987 and 2012, pasure and rangeland did not, but insead shifted away from the larges farms and ranches and toward smaller operations. In 1987, farms and ranches with at leas 10,000 acres of pasure and rangeland operated more than half (51 percent) of all pasure and rangeland, while those with less than 1,000 acres held 15 percent. By 2012, the share operated by the larges acreage class had fallen to 44 percent, while farms and ranches with less than 1,000 acres of pasure and rangeland operated 22 percent."}, {"section_title": "Consolidation in Livesock Varies", "text": "Consolidation in livesock production follows a diferent pattern than that in crops. When it has occurred, it has not unfolded at a seady and persisent rate over time. Insead, livesock consolidation proceeded episodically, with periods of sharp change in the size of operations, followed by sability. As in our analysis of specifc crops, we tracked midpoints for each livesock commodity across census years. We used a sales midpoint-based on the number of animals sold or removed during a year-for livesock feeding indusries like broilers, turkeys, and fed cattle. We used midpoint herd or fock inventory values for egg layers and cows. Mos livesock production has shifted to much larger Some shifts have been dramatic. For example, the midpoint milk cow herd in 1987 was at 80 cowshalf of U.S. milk cows were in herds of at leas 80 cows, and half were in herds with no more than 80. By 2012, the midpoint had increased more than tenfold, to 900 cows. Similar dramatic increases occurred in egg layers and in hogs and pigs, as each indusry underwent sriking changes in organization and farm size. In other sectors (like broilers, turkeys, and fed cattle), production shifted to larger operations by 2012, but the shifts were not persisent, and there is little evidence of continuing consolidation in 2007-12. Major reorganizations of those indusries occurred earlier, in the 1960s and 1970s, and the later shifts refected further adjusments. One important sector shows little consolidation. The midpoint beef cow herd was at 89 cows in 1987, a bit larger than the midpoint milk cow herd. By 2012, the midpoint beef herd had increased, but only modesly, to 110 cows. Beef cow herds, and the calves that they birth, typically graze on pasure and rangeland, which showed no consolidation in the period. Other livesock, such as sheep, goats, and horses, may also graze on pasure and range-but cattle are the major users of what amounts to nearly half of all U.S. farmland. Hence, cattle grazing, and the pasure and range that they graze on, are an important exception to the srong trend toward consolidation in agriculture."}, {"section_title": "Farm Sales Have Also Shifted to Larger Farms", "text": "So far, we have focused on specifc livesock and commodities, and showed that acreage and production in mos have consolidated into larger enterprises. However, mos farms are diversifed: those with crops almos always produce more than one, and while some livesock producers are specialized, mos also grow some crops. Hence, a complete picture of farm consolidation requires that we look at all products on a farm, which we do by tracking consolidation in farm sales. We measure sales with gross cash farm income (GCFI), which represents all revenues fowing to a farm business from commodity sales, contract fees realized by raising crops or livesock for someone else, government payments, and \"farm-related\" income (such as land rentals, cusom services provided to others, or insurance indemnities). Because GCFI can be afected by infation in prices irrespective of any change in production, we adjus for infation and report GCFI in 2015 dollars. We use USDA's annual Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) for sales data, and can therefore extend the analysis through 2015. There is subsantial consolidation in farm sales. In 2015, small farms with less than $350,000 in GCFI accounted for about 25 percent of the value of agricultural production, down from 46 percent in 1991. In contras, farms with at leas $1 million in GCFI accounted for 51 percent of all production in 2015, compared to 31 percent in 1991. The broad trend supports the evidence from the crop and livesock measures of a subsantial shift of production to larger farms."}, {"section_title": "What Do the Patterns Tell Us About the Drivers of Consolidation?", "text": "Consolidation shows disinct patterns. It occurred in mos crop and livesock sectors, but not in grazing and pasureland and not in the beef cow-calf sector. Consolidation proceeded seadily in crops, and more episodically in livesock, but was not concentrated in any single period. Technological developments in agriculture allow a single farmer or farm family to manage more acres or more animals than they could in the 1970s and 1980s, and these developments likely play an important role in consolidation. Specifcally, larger, faser, and more precise tractors, planters, sprayers, and harvesing equipment reduce the time a farmer mus devote to feld tasks on a given acreage, freeing a farmer to manage more acres. Pes management innovations of the las several decades-such as chemical herbicides, genetically engineered herbicide-tolerant seeds, and seed treatments-also reduce labor commitments for feld tasks. In livesock, the continued development of confnement feeding practices has been an important driver of consolidation. Producers moved poultry and hog production into climate-controlled housing, while dairy production and cattle feeding placed mos animals in open barns and pens. Those shifts, combined with seady improvements in disease control, reproduction, and nutrition/feeding practices, allow producers to manage more animals while also realizing subsantial improvements in productivity. Agricultural policy, in the form of USDA commodity programs, is directed primarily at feld crops. If commodity policy was a dominant factor in consolidation, we should therefore expect consolidation to be concentrated in feld crops. However, the patterns described above show that consolidation has occurred across a wide range of feld and specialty crops, as well as livesock sectors. Another important USDA program, Federal crop insurance, has been expanded sharply since the mid-1990s; while there are policies aimed at specialty crops and some livesock sectors, the primary focus has been on feld crops. However, since consolidation proceeded rapidly in many crop and livesock commodities, and before the mid-1990s, it seems unlikely that crop insurance could have played a dominant role."}, {"section_title": "Family Farms Still Dominate Agriculture", "text": "A family farm combines ownership and decision making in a single family. Specifcally, a family farm is defned as one in which the person primarily responsible for day-to-day operating decisions-called the principal operator-also owns the majority of the farm business, either individually or in combination with relatives. Family farms account for 99 percent of all U.S. farms and 89 percent of agricultural production, and we see no reduction in those shares over time. Even among the larges farms, those with at leas $5 million in sales, family operations accounted for 78 percent of farms and 73 percent of production. Nonfamily farms include many types of organizations. Many large nonfamily farms are partnerships among a small number of unrelated people, while others are operated by a hired manager on behalf of a family that owns the farm or a larger multifarm business. Large corporations do operate farms, particularly in poultry and hog production, but their primary role in agriculture is to coordinate supply chains through the provision of inputs to family farms, and by contracting with family farms to raise commodities. The dominance of family businesses is a disinctive attribute of U.S. agriculture and derives from several features of agriculture. While there are some scale economies in agriculture, mos can be fully realized by family farms that remain fairly small businesses-enormous size is not necessary to efectively implement agricultural technologies. Agriculture often does require detailed localized knowledge (of soils, pess, and microclimates), and farmers mus often act quickly and fexibly to weather conditions. Family business are well suited to develop localized knowledge and to adapt quickly and fexibly."}]
