[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped non-segmented positive-sense RNA viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae, with a genome ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases in length [1] . Among the several coronaviruses that are pathogenic to humans, most are associated with mild clinical symptoms, with two notable exceptions: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [2, 3] , which have caused more than 10000 cumulative cases in the past two decades with mortality rates of 9.5% and 34.4% respectively [4] [5] [6] . In December 2019, a novel pneumonia, termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , emerged in Wuhan, China and has been proven to be caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [7] . All the twenty-seven first cases reported by December 31, 2019 were closely related to exposure with the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan [8] . By analyzing the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2, it was speculated that the pathogen originated in bat, the natural reservoir host, and then transmitted to humans via an uncertain wild animal intermediate host [9] . There is convincing evidence that the human-to-human transmission has occurred since the end of December 2019 or the early January 2020 [10] . To control the spread of COVID-19, the Wuhan authority has sealed off the entire city from outside contact since Jan 23, 2020. However, it's estimated that five million people have left Wuhan before the \"lockdown\" and travelled throughout China [11] . By April 1, 2020, the disease has affected over 200 countries, with over 880,000 confirmed cases and 44220 deaths [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . In China, substantial attention has focused mainly on Wuhan, whereas the detailed information regarding the disease outside Wuhan is rarely reported [19, 20] . Furthermore, little is known about the changes in pathogenicity, clinical manifestations and mode of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 when the epidemic expanded beyond Wuhan.\nHere, we summarized the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of 20 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Guangdong who hospitalized in the 3rd affiliated hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from January 22 to February 18, 2020, and compared these cases with previous reported cases in Wuhan, aiming to provide information for understanding the changes in clinical manifestations and transmission model."}, {"section_title": "Study design and participants", "text": "The study was approved by the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University Ethics Committee, and oral consent was obtained from patients.

Among Guangzhou patients, 14 had a history of living or travelling in Wuhan, and 6 were local incident patients with a history of close contact with confirmed cases. 10 Guangzhou patients were from seven clusters, including five family clusters, one cruise ship cluster and one driving tour cluster to Wuhan, while only two shoppers were community clustered among Wuhan patients.\nPatients in both cities mainly manifested fever, cough and myalgia.

Both hospitals are designated hospital for COVID-19. Although small in number, the Guangzhou patients were a random sample at an early stage when cases started being imported into a major city. The different admission time in the two hospitals could represent two stages of the epidemic, while treatment and follow-up time are the same, which may well reflect the changing clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the disease.\nThe median ages of cases in Wuhan reported by Cao and Zhang were 49.0 and 55.5 years respectively 8, 22 , while patients in Guangzhou were relatively younger, with the median age of 43.2 years. There have been reports of cases in children, indicating all ages are susceptible [24] . Compared with patients in Guangzhou, patients in Wuhan were more severe, reflected by that Wuhan patients had a higher incidence of dyspnea and ARDS, higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers and worse prognosis. These differences could be due to age and pre-existing conditions [8, 25, 26] . However, in the present study, we did not observe an evident difference in underlying disease between Guangzhou patients and Wuhan patients. We speculate that the differences may be related to that the diminishing pathogenicity of the virus after transmission of multiple generations [5, 27] , however, further studies are required to confirm this hypothesis. Besides, patients in Guangzhou were more aware of the disease; thus, they visited the hospital at the earlier stage with less severe symptoms. Furthermore, given the experience in Wuhan, the health authorities in Guangzhou were wellprepared for the epidemic and were able to carry out comprehensive screening, early case identification and contact tracing and timely treatment.\nIn terms of clinical characteristics, we observed that the gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting were more prevalent in patients with later-onset in Guangzhou. Meanwhile, fecal RNA was positive in 4 out of 7 patients, indicating the possibility of gastrointestinal transmission. Xiao Fei also confirmed gastrointestinal infection by detecting SARS-CoV-2 in feces and gastrointestinal tissues [28] . These findings have important implications for patient triage and hospital risk zoning. Gastroenterology outpatient medical staff could be at higher risk when encountering COVID patients, thus more aggressive PPE protection and proactive patient screening are necessary. In addition, sufficient education and protocols should be given to caregivers who could be exposed to the patients' vomits and feces directly, and feces disposal should be managed properly to reduce environmental harzards. More importantly, we found that two patients' fecal virus RNA turned negative 5 and 6 days later than the nasopharyngeal swab respectively, suggesting that transimission of virus is possibly prolonged, and fecal virus RNA may be an indispensable indicator for lifting quarantines. Given that some \"recovered\" cases being tested positive again a few days after discharged have been reported recently [29], our findings highlight the importance of fecal virus test for patient management and quarantines. The health authority may also have to re-consider quarantine strategy for possible extended case management time and burden when distributing health resources.\nOur findings also suggest that the modes of transmission have changed considerably with the spread of the disease. A large fraction of early reported cases in Wuhan were linked to Huanan seafood markets, whereas none of cases in Guangzhou had a history of exposure to wildlife markets. Furthermore, 10 patients from Guangzhou were involved in seven cases of clustering. This finding suggests strong community transmission poses a great challenge to the entire prevention and control. It resonates with the concept that the transmissibility increases while virulence decreases as virus spread [30] . As indicated by Tang's research, the L type of SARS-CoV-2 prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, decreased after early January 2020, while the S type, which is less aggressive, have increased in relative frequency due to relatively weaker selective pressure [31] . Thus early detection and timely isolation is vital before a case becomes a cluster. It also raises the concern that the risk and benefit should be balanced in home quarantine for confirmed cases which could result in family case clusters.\nAt present, symptomatic, support treatment and airway maintenance are the main treatments, as there is no proven effective antiviral therapy. It is claimed that kaletra, remdesivir and chloroquine phosphate have antiviral effects from preliminary studies [32, 33] , but the results of clinical trials are yet to be released. Patients in Guangzhou mainly use kaletra + arbidol, some with severe pulmonary inflammation added interferon atomized inhalation, which has also achieved good treatment effect. Nevertheless, further research with control groups would be helpful to differentiate whether the effect is caused by drugs or patients' self-recovery of the disease.\nOur study has limitations. First, the number of patients was small. Second, Wuhan cases are from published data, and more detailed information, such as the final prognosis of patients, could not be obtained.\nIn summary, our results suggest that the virulence of SARA-CoV-2 is possibly waning in the process of transmission and the clustering occurrence is becoming the primary model of transmission. In addition, our observation that fecal virus RNA turned negative later than the nasopharyngeal swab justifies that the concern of faecal-oral transmission and suggest that fecal virus RNA should be assessed before lifting quarantine.
