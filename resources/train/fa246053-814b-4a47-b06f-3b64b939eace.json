[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "This study examines the relationship between community college enrollment patterns and two successful student outcomes-credential completion and transfer to a four-year institution. It also introduces a new way of visualizing the various attendance patterns of community college students. Patterns of enrollment intensity (full-time or part-time status) and continuity (enrolling in consecutive terms or skipping one or more terms) are graphed and then clustered according to their salient features. Using data on cohorts of first-time community college students at five colleges in a single state, the study finds that, over an 18-semester period, ten patterns of attendance account for nearly half the students, with the two most common patterns characterized by enrolling in one semester full-time or one semester part-time. Among the remaining students who persisted, there is astounding variation in their patterns of enrollment. Clustering these patterns reveals two relationships: the first is a positive association between enrollment continuity and earning a community college credential, and the second is a positive association between enrollment intensity and likelihood of transfer."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The study of student pathways through community college has become an important part of understanding the whole student experience. Student pathways are the time-ordered series of courses that students complete as they advance toward their education goals, typically program completion with a credential or transfer to a bachelor's degree program. Centrally related to student pathways are students' enrollment patterns-both the intensity of enrollment as measured by full-time and parttime status and the continuity or attachment of enrollment as measured by the consecutiveness of attendance. It is well known that few students who enroll in public two-year colleges go on to complete an award within two years of study (Radford, Berkner, & Wheeless, 2010) . A key reason for this is that community college student pathways and enrollment patterns are anything but traditional; students routinely switch into and out of full-time and part-time status, and they frequently skip terms. 1 Precisely how diverse student enrollment patterns are among students and the extent to which they are correlated with postsecondary outcomes have yet to be documented thoroughly. Although previous research has considered the relationship between starting as a full-or part-time student and educational outcomes (O'Toole, Stratton, & Wetzel, 2003) or has described the circumstance of mixed enrollment intensity (McCormick, Geis, & Vergun, 1995) , investigators have not typically considered the full extent of diversity in enrollment patterns. It is important for institutions to track students and understand when they are at risk of abandoning their studies, but colleges have not yet developed the ability to distinguish between normal variations in students' education pathways and danger signs of potential dropout.\nThis study addresses two research questions:\n(1) What are the enrollment patterns generated by community college students?\n(2) How are characteristics of these patterns related to postsecondary outcomes, such as earning a credential and transferring to a fouryear institution?\nUsing data on two cohorts of students at five colleges in a single state, the investigation presented here reveals the diversity of enrollment patterns in terms of intensity and continuity that are generated by community college students along their educational pathways. The study employs a novel graphical technique to illustrate these patterns. In addition, the study aggregates thousands of enrollment patterns into six distinct types using a cluster analysis that combines patterns based on their main features.\nThese clusters are found to be correlated with the probabilities that students will earn credentials and transfer to a bachelor's degree-granting institution.\nFour key insights result from this analysis, some of which contradict the conventional view of how community college students progress. First, there are many unique patterns of enrollment generated by students over a five-year period. Second, categorizations of students as either part-or full-time based on first-term enrollment are largely inaccurate as they ignore the high degree of switching between these two attendance states. Third, it is particularly challenging to get students into and through programs of study when attendance is so varied. Finally, clustering enrollment patterns reveals that while continuity is more strongly associated with earning a community college credential than is enrollment intensity, enrollment intensity is more strongly associated with transfer to a four-year institution than is enrollment continuity.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews relevant literature related to postsecondary enrollment intensity. Section 3 describes the dataset used for this investigation. Section 4 describes the empirical framework and findings. Section 5 presents a discussion of the findings, and Section 6 offers a conclusion."}, {"section_title": "Review of the Literature on Enrollment Patterns", "text": "The existing literature related to enrollment patterns can be grouped into two categories: studies that focus on students' first-semester experiences and those that look at student experiences over time. "}, {"section_title": "Initial Enrollment Intensity", "text": "Researchers often focus only on how students start college, or their intensity in the first term. Stratton, O'Toole, & Wetzel (2004 , 2006 and O'Toole, Stratton, & Wetzel (2003) have performed various analyses of the 1990/94 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Survey (BPS) to explore the link between enrollment intensity and dropping out of college among students in two-year and four-year colleges. Assessing differences between full-and part-time students, Stratton et al. (2004) concluded that older individuals and those in states with lower unemployment rates are less likely to enroll full-time. Stratton et al. (2006) focused on differences in attrition rates among students who begin postsecondary education on a part-time or full-time basis. Their analysis recognizes that factors correlated with initial enrollment intensity may be correlated with the decision to drop out, leading to bias in simply estimating the effect of initial enrollment intensity on the probability of attrition. Modeling both the choice to enroll as a full-or part-time student and the decision to drop out as separate but related processes reveals that observable factors associated with dropout behavior differ by initial enrollment intensity. That is, there are different observable factors associated with attrition depending on whether a student begins as a full-time or part-time student. The authors found that parental education, timing of enrollment, college GPA, and local economic conditions are associated with attrition for full-time students but not for part-time students. Therefore, it is not initial part-time status per se that is correlated with attrition, but the underlying differences in observable factors that determine the correlation between full-or part-time status and attrition."}, {"section_title": "Enrollment Over Time", "text": "O' Toole et al. (2003) produced one of few studies that relates initial enrollment intensity to intensity over time, revealing that using initial (first-term) full-time/part-time status underestimates the incidence of part-time enrollment intensity, as about one quarter of their sample stopped out or attended part-time for at least one term but still managed to graduate or continue to enroll at the end of five years.\nMore recently, Attewell, Heil, & Reisel (2012) used data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) to conduct a study from the academic momentum perspective, which posits that students who accumulate credits more quickly improve their chances of completing a college degree, independent of academic readiness or socioeconomic status. Credit accumulation is intimately related to enrollment intensity, as full-time students more often accumulate credits more quickly. Attewell et al.\nexamined four categorical indicators of momentum (no delay between high school and college, attending part-time in the first semester, taking 18 or more credits in the first semester, and enrolling in the first summer after freshman year) and used propensity score matching to identify average treatment effects of momentum on attaining a college credential. They found that graduation rates are lower for students who delay college entry and who take part-time course loads but found somewhat weaker positive effects on graduation for taking a large course load or enrolling in the first summer after freshman year.\nReports from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) have also addressed enrollment intensity over time in postsecondary education, though some of them are older, considerably broader in scope, and focused on four-year institutions.\nRelying on National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) data, McCormick, Geis, and Vergun (1995) analyzed college students during the single 1989-90 academic year and classified them as exclusively full-time, exclusively part-time, or mixed intensity.\nTheir descriptive study discusses the characteristics of each of these groups. In his analyses of nationally representative sample of recent high school graduates from the NELS, Adelman (1999 Adelman ( , 2006 found that students who attended full-time less frequently, did not enroll continuously, or were unable to earn at least 20 credits by the end of the first calendar year were much less likely to earn a bachelor's degree."}, {"section_title": "Contributions of This Study", "text": "The research reported here contributes to the literature on enrollment patterns in multiple ways. First, it focuses solely on community college students, rather than using a nationally representative dataset that combines college sectors or focuses on four-year colleges. A better understanding of students in two-year colleges can be obtained by studying them in isolation. Because they are more likely to have family responsibilities, to work full-time, to have greater financial constraints, and to be more academically underprepared than their counterparts in four-year institutions (Horn & Nevill, 2006) , community college students attend college erratically and vary greatly in the rate at which they earn college credits.\nSecond, this study uses a longitudinal approach in identifying enrollment patterns.\nMost studies consider enrollment intensity in the student's first term as the most important aspect of intensity, and none have described the subsequent variation in intensity revealed as students progress along their pathways. Third, a new method for describing enrollment patterns is introduced that provides a visual representation of the entire diversity of enrollment patterns. To aid interpretation, the resulting patterns are clustered by intensity and continuity features, which in turn link enrollment decisions (such as switches from full-to part-time attendance) to postsecondary outcomes. This kind of representation could be useful in facilitating communication among faculty and other stakeholders about how community college students attend college, and it could help illustrate the link between aspects of enrollment patterns and postsecondary outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Data Overview", "text": "This study uses student-level data from five community colleges located in a single state in the United States. Since they are part of a centralized state system, the colleges participate in a common course numbering system and offer a similar set of degrees and certificates. Each college uses a semester system in which an academic year is defined as the fall and spring terms followed by a shorter summer term. Credential attainment data were provided by the colleges, and data on transfer to other colleges came from the National Student Clearinghouse.\nThe sample consists of 14,429 degree-or transfer-seeking students. They generally intended to earn a certificate, diploma, or associate degree, distinguishing them from the block of community college students who enroll in shorter, non-credit vocational or adult basic skills programs. 3 Student data across the five colleges have been aggregated; the Appendix presents descriptive statistics."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Analysis", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Patterns of Enrollment", "text": "This section begins by introducing a framework for analyzing patterns of enrollment, focusing on the characteristics of continuity and intensity. Intensity distinguishes between full-time and part-time enrollment, where full-time is defined as attempting 12 or more credit hours in the fall and spring terms and six or more credit hours in the summer term. 4 In general, a full-time course load means four courses in a 16-week fall or spring semester. Including summer terms forces a few nontrivial decisions.\nTaking at least one course in the summer is not uncommon, and it represents an important 3 Students in the sample are considered degree-or transfer-seeking if they took placement exams or, when placement exam results were unavailable, they enrolled in credit-bearing courses and did not meet any of the following criteria: enrolled in non-credit vocational courses; enrolled in English as a Second Language (ESL), Adult Basic Education and Graduate Equivalency Degree (ABE/GED) programs; or enrolled dually in high school and college. Students who just seek to take some courses and not pursue a degree are generally not required to take placement tests. Over the 18 observed terms and 14,429 students in the sample, there are 4,594 distinct patterns of full-time, part-time, and non-enrollment. Though it is impractical to tabulate all of them, the ten most common types are shown on the top panel of Table 1 and ten of the least common patterns are presented on the bottom panel. 8 Of over 4,500 distinct patterns, the ten most frequent types account for 44 percent of students. The two most common patterns are for students who enroll either part-time only or full-time only in the first term (28 percent of students). These 4,000 students are generally the earliest dropouts, and their frequency is striking. Nevertheless, a small portion of them do earn short-term certificates (19 students) or transfer to a four-year institution sometime after that first term (595 students).\nAlthough many of the students in the sample enroll sparsely, as suggested by the top panel, there are thousands of students who generate unique enrollment intensity patterns over a long period of time, as illustrated by those in the bottom panel. These students are characterized by several matriculation periods, gaps in enrollment, longer persistent states of attendance or non-attendance, and frequent switching among full-time, part-time, and non-enrollment status. In general, common patterns are short and unique patterns are long. The longer a student stays, the more likely the student's pattern will be unique. Few students who stay relatively longer do so in identical ways.\nIt is important to note that students usually stop enrolling after they graduate or\ntransfer, yet the pattern representation used here does not provide any provision for formal exit. Among students captured in the top panel, 65 (about 1 percent) earned a certificate or associate degree. Certificate awards are concentrated in the second pattern and associate awards in the sixth pattern. The purpose of this paper thus far has been to introduce this method and draw attention to the impressive number of enrollment intensity patterns generated. The next sections show how one can visualize these patterns and draw conclusions from them."}, {"section_title": "Visualization of Enrollment Intensity and Continuity", "text": "To better understand the entire range of enrollment patterns without tabulating every distinct type requires a graphical approach. A well-organized image can be constructed from the pattern vectors, providing a broad overview of the patterns and how they relate to graduation and transfer. I consider each student's vector as shown in Table   1 and stack them all on top of each other to create a matrix of 14,429 students by 18 terms. In the images that follow, student vector patterns are represented by thin bands of color instead of zeros, ones, and periods. The student vector patterns are sorted and stacked to create a matrix of student enrollment status by term where similar patterns are grouped together. The height of each resulting block of color in each term is proportional to the number of students it represents. The intuition is that in term one some students attend full-time and others attend part-time. In term two, the full-time students in term one attend full-time, attend part-time, or do not enroll, as do first-term part-time students.\nStudents continue to be divided in this manner, term by term, and the resultant graphic representation uses three different colors for full-time, part-time, and non-enrollment status to illustrate the patterns. An immediate concern when looking at patterns like those of Figure 1 is that some students graduate or transfer out of the community colleges, and their doing so results in later periods of non-enrollment. It is possible to show the relationship between completion outcomes and enrollment intensity on these figures by overlaying indicator marks where and when completion outcomes occur. Figure 3 updates Figure 1 by adding indicator marks to show when students have earned a degree or certificate, and Figure 4 shows when students transfer by adding indicator marks (purple dots) that represent students' first enrollment term in a four-year school. 10 Perhaps not surprisingly, credentials are most heavily clustered along the top of Figure 3 , where students have more consecutive terms of full-time enrollment. 11 However, there are several examples of persistent students who manage to earn a credential after 12 or even 15 terms of part-time or intermittent enrollment."}, {"section_title": "Figure 3 Image of All Enrollment Patterns Showing When Students Graduate", "text": "Note: Blue indicates part-time enrollment; orange indicates full-time enrollment; white space indicates nonenrollment. The height of each block of color in each term is proportional to the number of students it represents. An indicator mark shows that a student earned a credential. Legend entries for indicator marks, some of which overlap, are Short-term Certificate (244 students), Long-term Certificate (157), Associate of Arts (538), Associate of Science (56), and Associate of Applied Science (658). Some students have award dates in terms in which they have no enrollment record, resulting from late filing of award paperwork or a delay in recognizing transfer credit, among other reasons."}, {"section_title": "Figure 4 Image of All Enrollment Patterns Showing When Students Transfer", "text": "Note: Blue indicates part-time enrollment; orange indicates full-time enrollment; white space indicates nonenrollment. The height of each block of color in each term is proportional to the number of students it represents. Each of the 2,656 purple dots, some of which overlap, indicate a student's first term enrolled in a four-year institution.\nThe indicator marks in Figure 4 that represent transfer show a few clusters where one would expect them to be. Some students transfer after one term of community college study, perhaps due to deferral from a four-year institution, spring admission to a four-year institution, or perhaps even co-enrollment at a four-year institution. Of the 148 students who attended in term one and transferred by term two, 4 percent began community college in the spring and 32 percent began in the summer. Others arrive at the four-year college during term four, which would likely be the first fall term after a full year of community college study. Terms seven and ten have clusters of transfers, a pattern expected of fall entrants who transfer to a four-year institution in a following fall term. Remarkably, the transfer patterns suggest a high degree of non-continuous postsecondary enrollment. Though most transferees leave after one or two community college terms, many students depart community college and then wait years before enrolling in a bachelor's degree-granting institution. Still others engage in concurrent enrollment (as seen by transfer indicator marks inside of the blue or orange bars)."}, {"section_title": "Summary of Vector and Graphical Analysis", "text": "The method presented here provides a readily available tool for describing student progress both quantitatively and qualitatively. Some key insights emerge from the vector and graphical analyses taken together. First, they reveal that students generate a lot of patterns due to intermittent enrollment and frequent switching between full-and part-time status. There are seemingly almost as many patterns of enrollment as there are students (4,585 distinct patterns for 14,429 students). Some students still enroll alternately fulltime and part-time well into their sixth year of study (17 percent). About 1 percent of students follow the traditional fall-spring, fall-spring pattern (with a break for summer) during the first six terms, followed by no additional enrollment in subsequent terms.\nSome 28 percent of students have only one term of community college enrollment, and over one quarter of them never return after that first term. Almost 40 percent of students enroll in one term or in two consecutive terms and never return to either a two-year or four-year institution within the study's tracking period. Except for those who leave the institution early into their postsecondary careers, few remaining students have the same enrollment patterns in college.\nSecond, and related to the first, there is a lot of switching between full-and parttime status. In general, those who begin as full-time students are more likely to attend full-time subsequently, suggesting a much quicker rate of credit accumulation than for those who start part-time. However, students frequently switch between full-and parttime attendance (43 percent of students do so at least once.) About 69 percent of full-time starters who returned at least once had at least one part-time term. Half of part-time starters who returned at least once had at least one full-time term. This finding challenges the notion that starting intensity is indicative of future enrollment intensity (and it reinforces the findings of O'Toole et al. [2003] discussed earlier). Similarly, among students who enrolled in more than one term, 17 percent attended only full-time, 22 percent attended only part-time, and 61 percent attended a mix of part-and full-time.\nAbout one quarter of students had two or more switches between full-and part-time status, and 32 percent of students had consecutive part-time enrollment. The high degree of switching challenges the common assumption that students can be identified as full-or part-time based on their status upon entering college.\nThird, the patterns help explain why colleges have difficulty getting students into and through programs of study (Jenkins & Cho, 2011) . The enrollment intensity figures reveal that students who persist are quite likely to experience a range of enrollment intensities over their college careers. Very few community college students follow a traditional fall-spring-fall-spring pattern with full-time enrollment in all terms (1.2 percent), the pathway that is often advertised by colleges as standard and that can be seen in suggested curriculum guides on college websites. Few students earn an associate degree in expected two years (3.5 percent). Over a six-year/18-term horizon, many students leave after their first contact with the college (28 percent). Only a handful of them complete short-term certificates or transfer to a four-year institution (15 percent of the 28 percent). In the cohorts under study, the typical student attended full-time in about 44 percent of the terms attended. Finishing a two-year degree within two years is bound to be uncommon when full-time enrollment is this low.\nThe enrollment patterns identified by the current study are remarkably varied and can be even described as chaotic; they raise several questions about the nature of the patterns. Why do full-time students switch to part-time and vice versa? Are there any differences in academic achievement between students who attend full-time consecutively compared with those who switch to part-time? What about differences in demographics or financial aid awards in the second term? Perhaps students simply cannot get into desired courses. Of course, a range of other factors (as well as the eventual attainment of postsecondary outcomes) will have an impact on whether, when, and how intensely students enroll."}, {"section_title": "Clusters and Their Relationship to Postsecondary Outcomes", "text": "Although there are thousands of distinct patterns of enrollment intensity, they are all generated from the same basic components: students attempt different course loads at different points in time. This section describes the pattern clusters based on the features of the patterns that indicate degrees of intensity and continuity, enabling the production of a typology of enrollments, a more parsimonious way of thinking about the student behavior observed. Variation in postsecondary outcomes among clusters provides a way to correlate the features of patterns with outcomes. The study employs a k-means clustering algorithm that generates six clusters of enrollment patterns. The clusters are created solely from the information gleaned from enrollment intensity patterns and do not include other academic or demographic characteristics (see the Appendix for a description of the clustering algorithm.) Though no researchers have performed work specifically to aggregate patterns of enrollment, previous research has incorporated enrollment intensity into a broader classification of student types. For example, Bahr (2010) has developed a typology of community college students using a similar cluster analytic technique. He built on earlier classification work (Ammon, Bowman, & Mourad, 2008; Hagedorn & Prather, 2005; VanDerLinden, 2002 ) that sought to identify broad types of community college students by combining behavioral data on course-taking and enrollment. Bahr used a very large sample of credit and non-credit students and focused on 13 enrollment and behavioral characteristics, such as units attempted in several subjects of study, enrollment intensity (mean units attempted per semester), course success ratios, and persistence (number of terms and years enrolled). Taxonomies such as this serve to illustrate the main types of students who are enrolling in these multiple-mission-oriented institutions and for what purpose. As Bahr noted, such an understanding can \"assist policymakers, administrators, practitioners, and other stakeholders in directing and optimizing the use of limited resources to maximize the benefits received by students.\u2026 Additionally, the increasing attention of institutional accountability \u2026 has drawn attention to the need to distinguish students who enroll for differing objectives or desired benefits\u2026\" (2010, p. 726).\nImportantly, the analysis presented here is related to but different from that of Bahr (2010) and his predecessors in that the emphasis is on aggregating the longitudinal patterns created only by variation in intensity and continuity of enrollment. The goal, however, remains to identify student types and provide a more parsimonious way of describing the enrollment patterns presented previously. Table 2 provides a summary of the clusters and their characteristics; Table 3 presents examples of patterns found in each cluster using the method described above. Students are unevenly spread across clusters, as Cluster 5 has 5 percent of students and Cluster 2 has 35 percent. This spread of students into clusters is not unexpected as 44 percent of students generate the top ten patterns of enrollment. Below I describe the clusters and provide descriptive names."}, {"section_title": "12", "text": "(Appendix Figures A.1 and A. 2 present visualizations of the clusters.) 12 It is important to note that there is a level of subjectivity required in naming and describing the clusters as well as in choosing which variables to include in their creation. Though I tried to be as fair and objective as possible, I chose to focus on particular attributes in developing labels; other researchers might interpret the clusters somewhat differently. The clusters, of course, are a result of the particular measures that I considered for the algorithm. Since the focus here is on enrollment intensity and continuity, I omitted many factors that could be used in a more general clustering of students. It is thus possible and probable that I have omitted some important factors related to enrollment intensity that would have resulted in different clusters."}, {"section_title": "Table 2 Clusters of Enrollment Patterns Generated From K-Means Algorithm", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Consecutive", "text": "Cluster Name N Students Pct.

These students do not interrupt enrollment until the eighth term on average, into the third year of study, and most of the enrollment is full-time. Their enrollment is front-loaded in the earliest terms and highly consecutive. These students consistently attempt to earn credits term after term at any intensity possible."}, {"section_title": "Students", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "No. of Terms", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Pct.

Students in this group also enroll for a long period of time-over nine terms, on average-but attend full-time less often than the Early Attachers. The students have a similar number of full-to part-time switches, but experience their first enrollment interruption earlier on, generally in their third term. That is, Later Attachers follow a more traditional approach of \"two terms on, one term off,\" and they also have a high degree of persistence. This group is more likely to switch from part-to full-time attendance than the opposite, but has a lower level of consecutive full-time enrollment due to more interruptions.\nThe six clusters identify some student types that appear elsewhere in the community college literature. For example, the Early Leavers cluster is similar to the drop-in cluster of Bahr (2010) , but perhaps with less favorable success rates. Like Bahr's clusters, those presented here also stratify along some demographic lines (though no demographic or environmental characteristics were considered in their creation). Table 4 presents demographic characteristics by cluster that show how some enrollment intensity and continuity clusters are correlated with individual characteristics (and how many are not There are no strong differences across clusters on a socioeconomic status index created from the variables shown on Appendix lowest college-readiness rates overall and in each individual subject. These findings are congruent with the notion that better prepared students are more likely to persist and rapidly accumulate credits than their less prepared counterparts who enroll with hesitation (part-time) and become discouraged quickly.\nOf more interest for this study is how postsecondary outcomes such as earning a credential or upward transfer correspond to clusters of enrollment patterns. Figure 5 shows the community college credential earning rates ( Taken together, the six clusters support the fourth main finding of this paper: students in groups characterized by high levels of enrollment continuity (Early Attachers and Later Attachers) are more likely to earn a credential than students in groups with low levels of continuity, and students in groups characterized by high levels of intensity and consecutive full-time enrollment (Full-Time Persisters and Early Attachers) are more likely to transfer to a four-year college than students in groups with low levels of enrollment intensity. Though not causal, these relationships suggest that taking breaks in enrollment (discontinuous enrollment) may be particularly harmful for students who desire to earn a credential and that part-time enrollment may be particularly harmful for students who desire to transfer. For credential seekers, it is important to maintain consecutive enrollment; for transfer seekers, it is important to earn credits early.\nAlthough it does not appear that the frequency of switching between full-time and parttime states is detrimental, it is clear that groups identified by mostly part-time or discontinuous enrollment have lower credential-earning and transfer rates. Continuity of enrollment and full-time study are critical for student success.

The section concludes with some directions for further research."}, {"section_title": "Possible Reasons for Students' Enrollment Pattern Variations", "text": "Students change enrollment intensity in response to personal work, family, financial, and academic considerations, but it is not always clear whether the enrollment patterns that result from such decisions are optimal for students. Intensity changes and interruptions in general may reduce positive peer effects and interfere with momentum for students. 13 Reducing from full-time to part-time attendance (as Early Persistent Switchers and Early Attachers do) may improve educational outcomes for some students by providing more time to focus on fewer courses and academic obligations. However, it is also possible that employment and other extracurricular activities may consume newly freed time.\n14 Reducing their course load may also be a response by students to poor academic performance. Students who do poorly in one term may respond by decreasing their intensity in future semesters (or by becoming discouraged and dropping out altogether). If the lighter intensity persists, students' rate of progress may be slowed significantly. It is, of course, possible that students may reduce intensity temporarily, perhaps due to short-term financial constraints or course availability, and then resume full-time attendance.\n13 There has been substantial research on summer learning losses for K-12 students, finding that skills and knowledge often deteriorate during the summer months, with low-income students facing the largest losses. Summer instruction is advocated as having potential to stop these losses and propel students toward higher achievement. See McComb et al. (2011) for a thorough review. 14 Dadgar (2012) discusses how working while in community college affects credit attainment and GPA. She finds small negative effects of working on academic outcomes.\nSimilarly, students might change from part-time to full-time attendance if they feel more confident academically, see an improvement in their personal or financial situation, or experience an increase in motivation or desire to complete a program of study. It is also the case that such a change could occur if a student lost employment but could still finance a full-time load. Increasing enrollment intensity should speed up degree completion since it speeds up credit accumulation, and this effect should be magnified if switching to full-time persists and students do not revert back to low intensity enrollment.\nIt may also be the case that the structure of community college programs of study is related to enrollment variation. The highly flexible structure of many community college programs, in which students can drop in and out at will at the very least allows, but may also encourage, great variation in enrollment patterns. Community colleges are in many cases offering access to courses but not adequately facilitating program completion (Jenkins, 2011) . Students who are in more coherent programs ( Does this behavior lead to a diagnosis of part-time status as a harbinger of dropout? The largest cluster of Early Leavers consists of students who make a similar decision to stop enrolling after very little time at the community college. What cost-benefit analysis are these students making that leads them to leave college so quickly? What factors contribute to this decision, and are the factors different for different groups of students?"}, {"section_title": "Policy and Program Implications", "text": "Gaining a better understanding of the student experience is invaluable for various stakeholders. College personnel need to know that a sizeable number of students do not persist past the first term (e.g., Early Leavers) and that few students choose the most efficient or recommended path toward earning a credential. These facts alone should inform developmental education design, program of study design, and advising strategies.\nAdministrators and faculty may not realize the wide variation in enrollment that their students experience. Chaotic and varied enrollment patterns (of, e.g., Early Attachers and Late Attachers) provide challenges for college administrators tasked with scheduling classes and determining staffing and resource requirements. Faculty members should be aware of the high likelihood that many of their students have significant interruptions in their enrollment and have departed from any type of \"traditional\" college pathway.\nAcknowledging the range of patterns is important for policymakers as well. They should realize that credential completion or transfer for community college students may take longer than two or three years, and that there may be policies and incentives related to financial aid, tuition, and placement testing that reinforce the suboptimal pathways taken by students. For example, policies surrounding the number of terms that Pell grant awards are available may make sense for most four-year college students but little sense for persisting community college students. The total number of terms for Pell eligibility was recently reduced to 12 from 18, a policy change that might hinder completion for many community college students. When designing metrics for evaluating college performance, policymakers should consider that college enrollment patterns range from those characterized by Early Leavers to Early Attachers-these different types of students make very different choices after their first contact with the college and may have different goals."}, {"section_title": "Implications for Future Research", "text": "The analysis presented here should give pause to researchers studying community college student behavior who are analyzing panels of short time periods. They face significant limitations in capturing the student experience. Similarly, researchers working in longitudinal frameworks should understand how the diversity of enrollment patterns impacts studies of educational timing. Many studies often use initial enrollment intensity when examining postsecondary student behavior and outcomes. First-term intensity may be a useful proxy for unobservable characteristics such as self-esteem and perceived academic ability as much as it is a function of financial and time constraints. However, it does not always indicate future enrollment intensity. Researchers studying transfer should be aware that the transition from two-to four-year college is often not immediate, requiring a close look at the timing of transfer.One potential area for further research is the development of a model that can generate the observed enrollment patterns. Similar to Stange (2012) and Keane and Wolpin (1997) , the strategy-though computationally complex-could model the dynamic decision-making process (enroll part-time, enroll full-time, work full-time, stop out, etc.) of these students over the life cycle. Researchers could then carry out policy simulations to study how enrollment decisions and postsecondary outcomes would change in response to changes in: opportunity costs of going to college, tuition, self-assessment of academic ability (based on experiences at college), institutional structures, and remediation placement policies, etc.\nA second area of research could explore changes in enrollment intensity more closely. Does switching between full-and part-time enrollment help or harm students?\nThat is, is it better for students to have consistent enrollment of one type or to just accumulate credits in any way possible? Is a switch from full-to part-time attendance undesirable? Does such a switch imply greater part-time attendance in subsequent terms?\nRelated to these questions is the issue of modeling changes in enrollment intensity. Can one predict when students are likely to have a gap in enrollment, change intensities, or simply enroll in the next semester full-or part-time? What characteristics are associated with these transitions?\nA third important area of study concerns transfer. Many students enter the community college with the desire to transfer to a four-year institution. However, as And how do disruptions between community college enrollment and four-year college enrollment affect degree completion?"}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusion", "text": "This paper presents a way to conceptualize and visualize community college enrollment patterns and to cluster them by their characteristics. It uses student-level data from a sample of 14,429 degree-or transfer-seeking FTIC students from five community colleges located in a single state who began in the 2005-06 or 2006-07 school year. After five to six years, most of these students forged paths that are not highly productive or efficient. The diversity in individual patterns cannot be understated-although nearly half of the students followed about ten patterns (most of them associated with early attrition from college), the remaining students took thousands of distinct pathways involving fulltime, part-time, and interrupted enrollment. Characterizations of students as either partor full-time are thus largely inaccurate as they ignore the high degree of switching between these two enrollment statuses. The chaotic enrollment patterns of students illustrated in this study pose challenges for colleges and other stakeholders in helping students enter and complete programs of study.\nClustering these enrollment patterns based on intensity, persistence, interruption, and frequency reveals six major pattern types. The most favorable graduation outcomes are associated with students who tend to enroll term after term with few breaks. The most favorable upward transfer outcomes are associated with students who tend to enroll fulltime rather than part-time. Continuity of enrollment and full-time enrollment whenever possible are keys to community college success."}, {"section_title": "K-Means Clustering Algorithm", "text": "K-means is a \"hill-climbing\" algorithm that seeks to maximize the differences between clusters and minimize the differences within clusters (Hastie, Tibshirani, & Friedman, 2009) . Variables used in the clustering algorithm are strictly related to the patterns generated by student course-taking. They include the total number of terms enrolled, the percentage of full-time terms, the number of full-to part-time, part-to fulltime, full-to full-time, and part-to part-time transitions as a percentage of the number of terms (both with and consecutively or without gaps), the total number of transitions between full-time and part-time states, and the locations of the first breaks in enrollment of one, two, and three terms (to capture shorter and longer stop-out behavior). All variables are scaled such that their means are 0 and standard deviations are 1. I executed the algorithm so that it produced three to ten clusters and determined that six clusters had good separability by within sum of squares measures. "}]
