[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) affects an increasing number of older adults worldwide. Cross-cultural comparisons can provide insight into how factors, including genetic, environmental, and lifestyle, may influence MetS prevalence. Metabolomics, which measures the biochemical products of cell processes, can be used to enhance a mechanistic understanding of how biological factors influence metabolic outcomes. In this study we examined associations between serum metabolite concentrations, representing a range of biochemical pathways and metabolic syndrome in two older adult cohorts: The Tsuruoka Metabolomics Cohort Study (TMCS) from Japan (n = 104) and the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) from the United States (n = 146). We used logistic regression to model associations between MetS and metabolite concentrations. We found that metabolites from the phosphatidylcholines-acyl-alkyl, sphingomyelin, and hexose classes were significantly associated with MetS and risk factor outcomes in both cohorts. In BLSA, metabolites across all classes were uniquely associated with all outcomes. In TMCS, metabolites from the amino acid, biogenic amines, and free fatty acid classes were uniquely associated with MetS, and metabolites from the sphingomyelin class were uniquely associated with elevated triglycerides. The metabolites and metabolite classes we identified may be relevant for future studies exploring disease mechanisms and identifying novel precision therapy targets for individualized medicine.\nsuggests that there are distinct ethnic and racial differences in prevalence, disease course, and risk factors associated with metabolic diseases [3] . Comparative population studies may enable better understanding of factors that underlie such differences. Insights from such comparative studies may also hold promise for the development of precision therapies for individualized medicine [4] .\nJapanese and American older adult cohorts have been extensively compared in relation to health outcomes because of known lifestyle and genetic differences. The Japanese population has also been studied as a comparison model of exceptional longevity [5] . Large, longitudinal studies including the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study (HAAS) [6] and the International Population Study on Macronutrients and Blood Pressure (INTERMAP) Study [7] have explored factors that affect metabolic risk as well as how cardiovascular risk factors may affect other health outcomes including dementia and cognitive impairment across Japanese, American, and other populations. Broadly, these studies have found a higher prevalence of metabolic diseases and conditions in the U.S compared to Japan, including higher body mass index (BMI) [8], diabetes [9], atherosclerosis [10], cardiovascular disease mortality [11], as well as higher blood cholesterol levels [12] and a differing prevalence of hypertension [13, 14] . Lifestyle factors play key roles in mediating these differences [15] . While these cross-national studies provide insight into how environmental, cultural, and genetic factors may influence metabolic disease prevalence, they provide limited insight into the plausible mechanistic underpinnings of such population differences.\nMetabolomics allows for the large-scale study of disparate small molecules that provide an indication of the biochemical products of cell processes. These tools can be used to better understand the functional and physiologic state of various tissues and can be used to measure alterations in biological pathways related to metabolic disease. The emergence of high-throughput metabolomics for analysis of molecular phenotypes, such as blood metabolite concentration levels, may enhance mechanistic understanding of how biological factors influence metabolic outcomes. Understanding the differences and similarities in the biological mechanisms underlying metabolic diseases across populations can provide important insights into treatment and prevention of these conditions. Recent studies have begun to explore cross-population and cross-ethnic differences in the metabolite signatures of various diseases. Two studies in Surinamese and Dutch cohorts [16] and South Asian and European cohorts [17] , identified associations between type 2 diabetes and sphingolipids, acylcarnitines, and amino acids. Another study in overweight/obese Caucasians and African Americans identified differences in associations between small-molecule metabolites and metabolic hormones and overweight/obesity [18] . To our knowledge, no study has yet compared differences in serum metabolite concentrations in American and Japanese older adults.\nIn this study, we examined associations between serum metabolite concentrations, representing a diverse range of biochemical pathways and prevalent metabolic syndrome in two well-characterized older adult cohorts: The Tsuruoka Metabolomics Cohort Study (TMCS) from Japan and the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) from the United States."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Over one third of adults in the United States suffer from metabolic syndrome, including conditions such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia [1] .

Metabolites from the phosphatidylcholines-acyl-alkyl, sphingomyelin, and hexose classes were significantly associated with these outcomes in both cohorts. There were no metabolites significantly associated with waist circumference and blood pressure in both cohorts. In Supplementary  Table S2 and visualized in Figure 2 , we present metabolites that were associated (FDR adjusted p value) with either MetS or individual risk factors that are unique to BLSA ( Supplementary Table S2a -f and Figure 2b ) and TMCS (Supplementary Table S2g -h and Figure 2c ), respectively. These were metabolites that were significantly associated with outcomes in one cohort and not the other. In BLSA, metabolites across all classes were uniquely associated with all outcomes (MetS and five individual risk factors). In TMCS, metabolites from the amino acid, biogenic amines, and free fatty acid classes were uniquely associated with MetS, and metabolites from the sphingomyelin class were uniquely associated with elevated triglycerides.

The American cohort had a significantly higher percentage of individuals with elevated triglycerides and reduced HDL despite a significantly higher percentage of individuals being on lipid modifying treatments (LMTs). The Japanese cohort had significantly elevated blood pressure despite a significantly higher percentage of individuals being on anti-hypertensive medications. There were no differences in percentage of individuals with high waist circumference or percent of individuals with elevated fasting glucose.\nPrior studies have reported significant lifestyle differences between American and Japanese cohorts, including a healthier diet-lower fat consumption and higher omega-3 fatty acids-as well as increased physical activity across the lifespan among Japanese [7, 20] . Diet is an important component of lifestyle and a potential mediator of cohort differences. In this study, we assessed diet using the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score-an indicator of a dietary pattern rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy produce and low in meats and sweets. This dietary pattern has been shown to protect against risk factors of metabolic syndrome [21] in multiple ethnic groups [22, 23] . We did not see significant differences in DASH scores between the BLSA and TMCS cohorts, suggesting that diet may not be a significant driver of differences in vascular risk profiles and may explain the lack of a difference in MetS between the American and Japanese cohorts included in this study. We additionally found that smoking rates were higher in the American cohort despite prior studies indicating that Japanese men have higher smoking rates than American men [24] .\nDespite similarities in the prevalence of MetS in the BLSA and TMCS cohorts as well as similarities in diet, we found differences between cohorts for over 85% of metabolites included in the analyses. These differences are likely a reflection of both biological and environmental variability between the cohorts.\nWe identified significant cohort differences across concentrations of the majority of metabolites as well as differences in lifestyle factors, including smoking prevalence. We additionally identified significant differences in important biologic factors, including AST and ALT, that have been shown to be elevated in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a disorder with a bi-directional association with MetS and individual risk factors [25, 26] . Despite these differences, it is striking that there is a distinct subset of metabolites that are associated with MetS and individual risk factors in both cohorts. These metabolites included phosphatidylcholines-acyl-alkyls, sphingomyelins, and hexoses, suggesting that metabolites in these three classes may represent fundamental markers of MetS and vascular risk. Serum concentrations of these metabolites may be important indicators of disease mechanisms that may also provide insights into effective treatments.\nA large body of work has shown that phosphatidylcholines are important regulators of energy metabolism [27] , and perturbations in phosphatidylcholine levels may be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and a number of metabolic diseases including diabetes and cardiovascular disease [27] [28] [29] , as well as NAFLD [30] . Phosphatidylcholines-acyl-alkyls have specifically been shown to be associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome in a Canadian cohort [31] . Two phosphatidylcholine metabolites identified in this study (PCaec34:3 and PCaec36:3) were also associated with diabetes mellitus progression and risk of onset of diabetes in Taiwanese [32] and Korean [33] cohorts, respectively. Interestingly, we previously reported that two metabolites also identified in this study (PC ae C34:2 and PC ae C36:3) were among a panel of metabolites that discriminated between Alzheimer's disease and control samples [34] . These converging results suggest that aberrations in specific phosphatidylcholines-acyl-alkyls may be intrinsic to diseases associated with vascular risk and, therefore, potentially important targets for disease intervention [35] .\nOur results additionally indicate that sphingomyelins are associated with MetS (i.e., SM C16:0) as well as with individual vascular risk factors (i.e., SM C16:0, SM C16:1, SM C24:1) in both cohorts. Similar to phosphatidylcholines-acyl-alkyls, sphingomyelins are major components of cell membranes and participate in cell-signaling pathways. Elevated levels of sphingomyelins have been shown to play a critical role in cardiovascular dysfunction including insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, and cardiomyopathy [36] . While levels of SM C16:0 were not shown to be associated with the clinical features of MetS in a young Japanese sample [37] , SM C16:0 was shown to be associated with insulin resistance in a Southern European cohort at high risk for cardiovascular disease [38] . Sphingomyelins likely play a significant role in chronic inflammation and may therefore be implicated in multiple metabolic diseases, including those of old age such as dementia [34, [39] [40] [41] .\nOur finding that hexose (the sum of all hexoses, which is predominantly glucose) was associated with MetS and fasting glucose was to be expected considering that fasting glucose and the serum concentration of total hexoses are highly correlated values. Additionally, increased concentration of hexoses was uniquely associated with an increased odds of elevated waist circumference and elevated blood pressure in BLSA only. This suggests that in the BLSA cohort, elevated peripheral hexoses, likely representing predominantly glucose, may be a more significant indicator of vascular risk than in the TMCS cohort. Prior work has suggested that increased serum hexoses may indicate poor glycemic control and insulin resistance [42] .\nWe additionally found metabolites significantly associated with outcomes that were cohort specific. One amino acid, valine, was associated with increased odds of MetS in TMCS. A number of recent studies have indicated the emerging importance of essential and non-essential amino acids in the development of obesity and diabetes mellitus [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . Valine in particular was one of three essential amino acids associated with obesity and visceral obesity in a Japanese volunteer sample (age range 20-60) [48] ; valine was also identified as associated with MetS in another Japanese sample (average age: 55) [43] . Interestingly, a previous study using plasma samples from post-menopausal women in the TMCS assayed metabolites using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOF MS) and reported higher concentrations of the branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) including valine in participants with MetS. [49] . Our observation of a similar association between serum concentration of valine and MetS in the TMCS cohort using LC-MS/MS confirms the prior findings reported by Iida et al. [49] . Together with prior studies showing that valine is associated with vascular risk factors [50] and NAFLD [30] even in non-Japanese populations, our work suggests the importance of exploring the role of valine as a biomarker of vascular risk as well as a focus of targeted therapies.\nA biogenic amine, alpha-aminoadipic acid (alpha-AAA), was associated with increased odds of MetS and increased triglycerides in the BLSA cohort. A study utilizing LC-MS/MS in the Framingham Heart Study found that this metabolite was positively associated with risk of developing diabetes, and individuals with alpha-AAA concentrations in the top quartile had greater than a four-fold risk of developing diabetes [51] .\nThere are several important limitations to our work. In this study, the Japanese group had a more restricted age range and were all recruited from the same city and prefecture in Japan whereas the United States (U.S.) group was more diverse, which may have partially driven differences in total number of unique associations between metabolites and outcomes. While the Japanese group is a more population-representative sample, the BLSA is a predominantly Caucasian sample of highly educated and relatively healthy older adults. Additionally, our metabolomic assays only detected a limited number of classes of metabolites in the serum metabolome. Also, we were only able to include lifestyle factors derived from comparable questionnaires between studies. Important lifestyle variables including physical activity and alcohol consumption were not measured similarly in the BLSA and TMCS studies and therefore could not be compared or included in our analyses. Finally, the cross-sectional nature of our analyses does not allow us to assess how alterations in metabolite concentrations over time may be related to the risk of MetS."}, {"section_title": "Methods and Materials", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Blood Samples", "text": "Blood serum samples were collected from BLSA participants at the NIA Clinical Research Unit in Harbor Hospital, Baltimore.

Smoking history was dichotomized as 'never smoker' vs. 'current/former smoker.' Diet quality was measured using the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score [56] . The DASH score indicates adherence to the DASH dietary pattern by measuring consumption of nine target nutrients including total fat, saturated fat, protein, fiber, cholesterol, calcium, potassium, and magnesium. We excluded magnesium as this target was not included in TMCS data collection. The DASH score therefore was the sum of eight nutrient components with higher values indicating a higher quality diet.\nLiver function tests, physical activity, and alcohol consumption were included as additional demographic variables to describe BLSA and TMCS participants. Liver function tests included aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), both shown to be elevated in non-alcohol fatty liver disease [57] and associated with MetS, insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia [58, 59] . Physical activity (PA) was measured using two different questionnaires in BLSA and TMCS. The PA questionnaire in BLSA has been described previously [60] ; total PA was determined by summing physical activity across three intensity categories (low, medium, high) and multiplying the hours spent in each activity/week by the assigned metabolic equivalent (MET) value. The PA questionnaire used in TMCS has been described previously [61] ; total PA was determined by summing all domains of activity (occupational activity, leisure time activity, sleeping, and other activities) and multiplying the hours spent in each activity/week by the assigned MET value. PA in both studies was summarized as 'METs/week.' Alcohol consumption in BLSA was dichotomized as 'never' vs. 'ever drank' any alcoholic beverages in the past 12 months.

We then imputed all missing values as the LOD threshold/2. Finally, we excluded all outliers defined as values outside the 3 interquartile region (IQR) (i.e., 3 \u00d7 IQR).\nNext, we compared demographic characteristics as well as prevalence of MetS and its individual risk factors (as well as mean values) between BLSA and TMCS using two-sample t-tests for continuous variables and chi-squared tests for categorical variables. We compared differences in metabolite concentrations between BLSA and TMCS. To account for multiple comparisons, we corrected for each of the 11 metabolite classes separately using false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p value [62] . We then used multivariate logistic regression models to explore the associations between the binary indicators of MetS (i.e., present/absent) and its five individual risk factors with metabolite concentrations. These models tested whether individuals with MetS or the five individual risk factors had different metabolite concentrations compared to control participants (i.e., without MetS or the five individual risk factors). This included six separate models, each with the following outcomes/dependent variables: MetS, elevated waist circumference, elevated fasting glucose, elevated triglycerides, reduced HDL cholesterol, and elevated blood pressure. Metabolite concentrations, which were the predictors/independent variables, were IQR normalized by subtracting the median from the metabolite value and dividing by the IQR. Model results indicate an increase or decrease in the odds of having MetS or an individual risk factor associated with a one-unit increase in the normalized metabolite concentration(s). Sex and age at blood draw were included as covariates in the model. We performed two sensitivity analyses: First, we explored associations controlling for additional lifestyle factors including smoking status and diet quality. We ran multivariate logistic models including both covariates, in addition to age and sex. Second, we explored associations in the main model including an additional sex interaction term (sex x metabolite) to explore whether the association between the metabolite and outcome differed by sex.
