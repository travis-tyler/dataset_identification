In a population-based study in which a gradient recalled-echo sequence at 1.5T was used, approximately 36% of the people \u03fe80 years old were found to have microbleeds, compared with only 7% of the people who were 45-50 years old. 1 In a systematic review of studies that used echo-planar and gradient recalled-echo sequences at 0.5-3T, hypertensive individuals were reported to be 4 times more likely than those in the general population to have microbleeds, 2 particularly in association with other signs of small-vessel disease, such as white matter hyperintensities and lacunar infarcts. 3, 4 In a review of multiple studies that used gradient recalled-echo and SWI sequences at 1.5T and 3T, people with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease were reported to have microbleeds at a prevalence of 20%-43% and 18%-32%, respectively, compared with 0%-19% in cogni-tively normal individuals. 5 In the setting of AD, microbleeds are associated with global brain amyloidosis, seen with increased uptake on positron-emission tomography scans by using [ 18 F]florbetapir 6 and decreased levels of CSF amyloid-\u2424 (A\u2424). 5 The anatomic distribution of microbleeds is believed to reflect their underlying pathology. Microbleeds located in the deep gray matter and infratentorial brain are typically seen in hypertensive individuals 2, 7 and correspond to foci of hemosiderin leakage from small abnormal blood vessels. 8 Conversely, microbleeds in the setting of aging and AD are typically lobar, at the corticosubcortical junction, 2, 7 and correspond to amyloid-\u2424 deposition along vessel walls, 9 also known as amyloid angiopathy. However, it remains unclear whether microbleeds, either from hypertension or amyloid angiopathy, relate to tau pathology or cognitive changes that lead to Alzheimer pathogenesis 10 independent of global brain amyloidosis.\nThe purpose of our analysis was to determine whether the distribution of microbleeds, either lobar or deep gray/infratentorial, has differential associations with downstream events in Alzheimer pathogenesis. Specifically, by using data from the multicenter Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (adni.loni.usc.edu), 11 we tested the hypotheses that lobar microbleeds 1) are associated with brain amyloidosis, reflected by lower CSF amyloid-\u2424 levels, 2) predict the presence of tau pathology after overall brain amyloidosis is adjusted for, and 3) predict greater longitudinal cognitive decline."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "The subjects of these analyses were 626 ADNI participants who had undergone 3T MR imaging and lumbar puncture for CSF analysis (151 cognitively normal, 389 with mild cognitive impairment, and 86 with AD).

Subjects were between the ages of 55 and 90 years and showed no clinical or structural evidence of a significant neurologic or psychiatric disease and no systemic medical illness or laboratory abnormalities that would interfere with follow-up. To reduce confounding by comorbid vascular disease, a subject was enrolled in the ADNI only if he or she had a low modified Hachinski score of \u05454. 13 Cognitive function was assessed by using the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS), 14 which is the most widely used measure for clinical trials."}, {"section_title": "MR Image Acquisition", "text": "Each subject underwent a standardized 3T MR imaging protocol, which included T2* gradient recalled-echo and T1-weighted 3D MPRAGE sequences (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/documents/ mri-protocols/).

Before any subject was scanned using this protocol, an ADNI phantom was used to assess linear and nonlinear spatial distortion, signal-to-noise ratio, and image contrast, which were reviewed by a single quality-control center to ensure harmonization among the sites. 15 Microbleeds were quantified visually by a board-certified neuroradiologist with subspecialty certification (G.C.C.). Microbleeds were defined as hypointense lesions within the brain parenchyma that measured \u03fd10 mm on the gradient recalled-echo sequence.

Comparisons of baseline variables among the groups were performed by using the Wilcoxon rank sum, Fisher exact, Kruskal Wallis, or 2 test, depending on the number of groups and type and distribution of the variables.\nTo test the hypothesis that lobar microbleeds are associated with overall brain amyloidosis, we used ordinary least-squares regression with age, sex, years of education, history of hyperten-sion, APOE2 and APOE4 status, and diagnostic group (normal cognitive function, mild cognitive impairment, or AD) as covariates. CSF A\u2424 values were log transformed for normality and included as the outcome variable. Lobar microbleeds were dichotomized as 0 or 1 (indicating presence or absence, respectively) and used as the predictor. The number of lobar microbleeds was then categorized as an ordinal variable of 0, 1, 2, 3, or \u03fe3 to determine whether increasing numbers of lobar microbleeds were associated with greater brain amyloidosis, reflected by decreased CSF A\u2424 levels. The regressions were then repeated by using deep gray/ infratentorial microbleeds, categorized as dichotomous or ordinal variables, to differentiate between microbleeds that may have been associated with hypertension and those associated with amyloid angiopathy.\nTo determine whether lobar microbleeds are associated with tau pathology, we used logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex, years of education, history of hypertension, APOE2 and APOE4 status, and diagnostic group. CSF A\u2424 level was also included as a covariate, dichotomized as normal or abnormal on the basis of the previously published cutoff of 192 pg/mL, 19 to determine the effect of microbleeds independent of global brain amyloidosis. We then dichotomized abnormal CSF p-tau levels by using a cutoff of 23 pg/mL, 19 which was used as the outcome variable. Lobar versus deep gray/infratentorial microbleeds were again included as the predictor, either as a dichotomous or ordinal variable. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of lobar microbleeds in predicting an abnormal CSF p-tau level were also calculated post hoc. To determine whether lobar microbleeds are associated with a longitudinal change in cognition, we used the following linear mixed-effects model:\nADAS ij represents the ADAS score of subject i at time point j, MCH i represents the presence or absence of lobar microbleeds in each subject, and t ij represents the time interval between ADAS tests. B 0 and \u2424 0 are the coefficients for the random and fixed variations in baseline ADAS scores, respectively. The coefficient \u2424 1 represents the fixed effect of having lobar microbleeds at baseline. Finally, \u2424 2 \u03e9 \u2424 3 are the coefficients for time-dependent changes in ADAS scores, irrespective or respective, of the presence of microbleeds.

Overall, the results of our analysis suggest a differential association of lobar versus deep gray/infratentorial microbleeds with Alzheimer pathogenesis, which reveals the importance of lobar microbleeds in prognostication, independent of CSF A\u2424 levels.\nThe first major finding, that lobar microbleeds are associated with greater overall brain amyloidosis, is concordant with the results of previous studies that showed lower CSF A\u2424 levels 3, 20, 21 and higher uptake on PET amyloid scans 5, 6 in people with microbleeds. Previous studies have also suggested that lobar microbleeds are more suggestive of underlying amyloid angiopathy, 2, 7, 9 which is seen concomitantly in 78%-98% of postmortem examinations of the brains of people with Alzheimer disease. 22 The finding that only higher numbers of lobar microbleeds were found to be associated with abnormal CSF A\u2424 levels suggests that severe amyloid angiopathy is related more to overall brain amyloidosis and may contribute to the disease process. On the other hand, deep gray/infratentorial microbleeds, which are associated more typically with hypertension, were not associated with CSF A\u2424 levels. Previous work also demonstrated that deep gray, not lobar, microbleeds are associated with small-vessel disease. 23 Therefore, hypertension may produce deep gray/infratentorial microbleeds and small-vessel changes but is likely involved in Alzheimer pathogenesis from a nonamyloid pathway, such as decreased cognitive reserve.\nThe second major finding is that having at least one lobar microbleed, unlike having deep gray/infratentorial microbleeds, was associated with greater odds of having an abnormal CSF p-tau level, after adjusting for CSF A\u2424 levels. Furthermore, in post hoc analyses, we found that the presence of at least one lobar microbleed had a high positive predictive value for an abnormal CSF p-tau level. However, the absence of lobar microbleeds had a low negative predictive value for excluding the presence of an abnormal CSF p-tau level. A recent study in a memory clinic population found a similar association between microbleeds and CSF total tau, but not CSF p-tau, levels in individuals without dementia. 21 The fact that they did not find an association between microbleeds and p-tau levels may reflect technical differences in the assay or the fact that p-tau is more specific for neurodegeneration in cohorts with more comorbid vascular disease. Nonetheless, both of our studies revealed an association between microbleeds and elevated levels of forms of CSF tau. One hypothesis is that microbleeds might reflect damaged microvasculature, resulting in decreased blood flow to neurons, ischemia, neuronal degeneration, and increased tau pathology. In postmortem studies, p-tau seems to have increased aggregation around arteries and arterioles with A\u2424 in the vessel walls. 24 Alternatively, microbleeds might induce enough inflammation, without duration, to cause an elevated CSF p-tau level. In an animal model, microhemorrhages were seen to trigger inflammation and activated microglia, macrophages, and lymphocytes 9,25 rather than cell death or ischemia. This inflammation may be sufficient to produce neuronal release of tau into the extracellular space. This inflammation may also contribute to further Alzheimer pathogenesis. Finally, the presence of lobar microbleeds, reflecting amyloid angiopathy, may suggest that a patient is farther along in the Alzheimer disease cascade. 10 In this case, lobar microbleeds, in addition to an abnormal CSF A\u2424 level, may signal more severe underlying disease.\nThe third major finding is that having at least one lobar microbleed is associated with accelerated longitudinal cognitive decline. Results discussed in the literature evaluating the association between microbleeds and cognitive decline have been variable, depending on the cohort studied (community-based populations, 26-29 people with a history of stroke or suspected stroke, [30] [31] [32] [33] or subjects in a memory clinic who had mild cognitive impairment/AD 3,34-38 ) and whether cognition was being evaluated on a 39 One study also found cognitive improvement after stroke if no microbleeds were present, 33 which suggests a detrimental role of microbleeds on cognitive recovery. However, none of these studies adjusted for concomitant Alzheimer pathology, which may have driven the longitudinal changes in cognition. In our study, the association between lobar microbleeds and accelerated cognitive decline persisted after adjusting for CSF A\u2424 levels, which suggests that microbleeds alone, perhaps reflecting underlying amyloid angiopathy, lead to cognitive impairment. This finding mirrors that of a postmortem study that found that moderate-to-severe amyloid angiopathy is associated with perceptual speed and episodic memory, even after adjusting for concomitant AD pathology. 40 We also found that having \u05463 lobar microbleeds was more associated with decreasing cognition, similar to the results of previous studies that found greater cognitive decline with \u05462 39 or \u05465 28 lobar microbleeds.\nThe finding that deep/infratentorial microbleeds were not associated with cognitive decline is concordant with results of a previous study 32 but differs from those of another study that found mixed, not strictly lobar, microbleeds were associated with cognitive decline. 39 Again, the differential effect on cognitive decline secondary to microbleed location may hint at differing etiologies of microbleeds.\nOur study has several limitations. First, the ADNI is not a community sample. The cohort consisted of more white people, people who were more highly educated, and people who had fewer comorbidities than a community population at this age. 11 Furthermore, subjects were excluded from the ADNI if they had significant comorbid vascular disease, reflected by a modified Hachinski score of \u03fe4.\n13 Therefore, although we did not find a significant effect on hypertension-related deep gray/infratentorial microbleeds on tau pathology and cognition, a significant association may be found in people with more significant vascular disease. As a result, generalization of these findings should be approached with caution, and further validation in prospective population-based cohorts, particularly those with concomitant vascular disease, is required."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The distribution of microbleeds provides clinically significant information, not only in suggesting differences in underlying etiology (ie, amyloid angiopathy versus hypertension) but also in demonstrating different associations with downstream events in Alzheimer pathogenesis (ie, tau and cognitive decline).
