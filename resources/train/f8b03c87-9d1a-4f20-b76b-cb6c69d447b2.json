[{"section_title": "Foreword", "text": "The International Standard Classification of Education, known by its acronym ISCED, was developed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization during the late 1960s and 1970s. ISCED was implemented in 1976 and is the recognized international standard for reporting and interpreting education program data. Creating a U.S. crosswalk to this system has been a goal of the National Center for Education Statistics and the Office of Research since the late 197,,s, when the National Institute of Education (the predecessor agency to the Office of Educational Research and Improvement) began exploring the idea. The design and implementation of a workable crosswalk, however, awaited the advent of changes to the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) system. The 1990 revision of the CIP system laid the foundation for a workable international crosswalk. Adoption of the National Education Goals set global consciousness and international educational comparisons firmly in place as important components of American educational policy and mission at the national level. We believe that this product will enhance the accessibility and utility of American educational data to the world community. Educawrs, policymakers, statisticians, researchers, and the interested public will benefit from both the crosswalk itself and from the discussion of the U.S. educational system and data that accompany it.

Among them are: to facilitate accurate data exchanges under extant treaties, agreements, and arrangements, both bilateral and multilateral; to help achieve the National Education Goals objectives of better and more extensive international comparisons of educational practices and achievement; to meet the challenge of the increasing global mobility of students of all ages, which means more Americans and foreigners holding credentials from one another's education systems; to provide users of U.S. education data, both in America and abroad, with effective means of comparing U.S. and foreign education data; and to provide a framework under which U.S. educators, policymakers, The technical author of this guidebook and crosswalk is E. Stephen Hunt, a senior research analyst in thc Higher Education and Adult Learning Division of the Office of Research, OERI. He is a co-author of the Classification of Instructional Programs: 1990 Edition (Washington: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1991). organizations, and the public can make informed decisions on international educational issues. In addition to these general points, the U.S. National Education Goals mandate an increased concern with international and comparative education developments in order to support the reform and improvement of education in the United States and the preparedness of all Americans for participation in the global economy. Most international education data reporting and analysis is based on the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED). ISCED was developed by the United Nations EdLcation, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and was implemented in 1976. Since 1976, the ISCED system has been adopted universally as the taxonomic format for reporting international education data and is used by international organizations as well as individual countries. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and_Development (OECD), of which the United States is an active member, uses the ISCED system, as do most OECD member countries. So does the European Community (EC). Major nongovernmental international organizations also employ ISCED, including the International Association of Universities (IAU) and the International Assessment of Educational Progress (IAEP). The information presented in this Guide contributes to more effective international education research and data exchanges by making possible more accurate, reliable, and valid reporting of data on instructional program activity than has been possible in the past. The crosswalks presented in the Guide allow data analyses at each level of education as defined by both ISCED and the National Center for Education Statistics. Because this crosswalk is keyed to both the 6-digit codes used in the U.S. CIP classification system and to the education level codes used in the CCD and IPEDS national surveys, it can be used to translate any data based on them. This feature permits use of this Guide by researchers and data consumers who employ different, or adapted, versions of these federal data systems. Whi!e it is preferable to use the current NCES-approved versions of CCD, IPEDS, and CIP, this is not always possible, especially for historical data collected under older classification systems and using earlier versions of survey instruments. Basing the postsecondary crosswalks to ISCED on the smallest pertinent data elements (6-digit instructional program codes in CIP) helps to overcome the longitudinal continuity problem because current CIP 6-digit codes can be crosswalked to and from prior editions of CIP and older classification systems."}, {"section_title": "Feasibility of Crosswalking U.S. Data to ISCED", "text": "The U.S. educational system differs in detail from those of other countries. This is not unusual national education systems nearly always exhibit characteristics of organization, philosophy, and governance that distinguish them from others and that make international comparisons difficult. Comparisons are possible, nonetheless, so long as what is to be compared can be operationally defined using similar terms, data can be collected using similar procedures and sources, and analyses of the results are bounded by the limits thus set. Such analyses must always be made with care. In all educational systems, at all levels, students enter and leave the system, are certified as having completed programs of study, and concentrate in specific subject fields. These educational processes, in all systems, are conducted through recognized institutions which are authorized to provide education. While individual national organization and patterns of education may differ widely, it is possible to report data on similar activities in mutually recognizable and useful ways. Comparability is possible, in part, because of general similarities in the way all national systems are organized and, in part, because of the existence of established international data reporting tools such as ISCED. ISCED provides eight levels for reporting education program data. Countries whose educational systems include secondary programs divided into lower (junior high/middle/intermediate school) and upper (senior high) divisions; that place advanced occupationally specific programs neither in basic secondary school nor higher education; and that offer more than ti-ree distinct types of postsecondary programs often have difficulty deciding how to fit these realities into the ISCED framework. Significant country-to-country differences in what a particular education level signifies are also lost when these important nuances are collapsed into a more general ISCED level designation. In addition to having fewer reporting levels than most countries have education levels or program completion points, ISCED also recognizes fewer educational program categories than many educational systems use. ISCED program descriptions are also quite broad and represent aggregations of specific program fields which educators and policymakers often treat separately. Furthermore, the arrangement of the ISCED program groupings does not always follow that used in the country supplying data under the ISCED system, thus necessitating a reorganization of data that may wind up bearing little resemblance to national practice. Despite difficulties in adapting data from various national data systems to the ISCED format, the system has grown to be the most pervasive and important education program classification in the world and is used widely in research as well as in data exchanges. It is likely that ISCED will continue to be the basis of international comparisons for the foreseeable future. The importance of ISCED makes it desirable to develop and use a standard method of translating U.S. education program data into the ISCED format, and vice versa."}, {"section_title": "Historical Efforts at International Data Crosswalks", "text": "In 1978, the National Center for Education Statistics sponsored a feasibility study to develop a crosswalk between the education program classification systems then in use and ISCED.2 While this effort did produce a conceptual framework for a data crosswalk, it was not implemented. In 1980 the National Center for Education Statistics developed the CIP system to combine and replace the previous classification systems. This change rendered the concepts developed in 1978 obsolete. In 1982, NCES revisited the question of a crosswalk to ISCED and prepared a concept paper based on the 1980 CIP and the data reporting conventions then being used.' No further work on a CIP/ISCED crosswalk was done until the 1990 CIP was designed and implemented. The 1990 CIP represents a significant modification and improvement of the CIP system: it is more logically arranged and easier to use than previous editions. These modifications were made in part with the possibility of a CIP/ISCED crosswalk in mind. Indeed, cumulative modifications to the CIP system over time, plus the profound differences between CIP and its predecessors (HEGIS and Handbook VI), combine to make data reporting under older versions of CIP and crosswalks from obsolete systems, unsatisfactory and unreliable. To insure conversion to the 1990 CIP, NCES has instituted an extensive program to train users and data providers and has provided a free conversion diskette to users who request it (the order form is in the 1990 CIP manual). The Need to Crosswani CIP, IPEDS, and CCD U.S. education program data are collected via two different groups of surveys, IPEDS and CCD. II EDS collects extensive postsecondary data on enrollments, program completions, and other questions, while CCD collects a variety of primary and secondary education data including enrollments by grade level and high school program completions. IPEDS and CCD each consist of a group of survey instruments which target different issues. Both are also censuses of the universe of educational providers (in the case of IPEDS) or state oversight bodies (in the case of CCD) dealing with the aspects of education activity they cover. Education program data collected through IPEDS are simultaneously arranged by CIP program classification and by IPEDS education level. CCD is not linked to CIP. federal data include such organizations as the College Board, Educational Testing Service, Institute of International Education (IIE), American Council on Education (ACE), and others.' Many state governments, educational systems, and individual institutions use CIP or classifications derived from it, as do independent researchers who employ federal education data in their work or cite it. Common Core of Data (CCD) Survey. The CCD functions as does IPEDS, except for the primary and secondary levels of education. It is a comprehensive series of survey instruments sent annually to state education agencies for collecting data the agencies obtain from public school districts, local education agencies, and individual schcols. Five separate surveys are conducted: the public school universe (selected characteristics of schools); the local education agency universe (basic agency data plus aggregate student statistics); the state aggregate non-fiscal report (student and staff data, statewide); the state aggregate fiscal report (state agency fiscal data); and early estimates (statewide school-year enrollment projections as of December 31). The CCD permits the maintenance of a national data base on public primary and secondary education, based on uniform reporting requirements and operational definitions. The CCD was first implemented in 1981, and has been refined periodically since that year. No data on the educational activities of students in the K-12 grades, such as subjects studied and courses taken en route to the high school diploma, are collected through CCD. Data are collected only on enrollments at each grade level and on the number of students earning high school diplomas or equivalency certificates. For purposes of definition, a high school diploma course of studies equates to a program as defined in CIP for postsecondary education. Programs of more specificity, corresponding to a secondary-level concentration or \"major,\" do not usually exist in the United States. Direct information about what subjects American high school students study is obtainable from the databases for each of the national longitudinal studies that have been sponsored by NCES since 1972.6 Each of these studies collects secondary school transcript data on respondents' course-taking activity. Because there is an 8-year gap between each of these studies, only the most recent transcript sample (1992) can be used to approximate current 5 The National Center for Education Statistics and other federal agencies supply data to these aad other organizations through various formal and informal arrangements, and such data are also available to the public. Federal law and regulations do not require the recipients to acknowledge the origin of the data (unless obtained under a contract), although the professiona' courtesy of citation is requested. For this reason, these data are frequently provided to organization clients in repackaged form without attribution as to origin, and the extent of reliance on federal expertise and data collection capabilities is thus obscured. 6 Three longitudinal studies have been conducted to date: the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Graduating Class of 1972 (NLS-72), starting with a sample of 12th graders; the High School and Beyond Study (IISB), starting with two samples, one of the sophomore (grade 10) and a second of the senior (grade 12) class of 1980; and the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS-88), starting with a sample of students in grade 8 as of 1988. Each longitudinal study is followed up at intervals across the academic and work careers of the respondents, with successive sample cohorts being surveyed. In addition, secondary and postsecondary transcript records are collected from respondents who agree to furnish them. practices. For this reason, no crosswalk pertaining to U.S. PK-12 curriculum content areas is presented in this Guide. learning experience has the elements of duration and continuity. Learning is taken as any change in behavior, information, knowledge, understanding, attitudes, skills or capabilities which can be retained and cannot be ascribed to physical growth or to the development of inherited behavior patterns.9 As has been pointed out in previous NCES-sponsored studies comparing U.S. and ISCED concepts and structure,' both ISCED and CIP are referring to the same type of data and define these data in similar ways. Therefore, no basic conceptual obstacle stands in the way of defining U.S. postsecondary instructional program data in terms of ISCED. Any problems to be encountered with such a crosswalk will be technical, not cultural, since ISCED is an international set of conventions and does not represent any national system. Since other national users of ISCED interpret their data in terms of this set of conventions as well, valid and reliable international comparisons employing the ISCED system are possible."}, {"section_title": "U.S. and ISCED Level Definitions", "text": "ISCED organizes educational programs into levels. CIP is not organized according to the degree level at which programs are awarded, but rather by the type of program being described.\" The levels at which various program data are reported, corresponding to levels of degrees awarded, are defined by IPEDS survey instruments and database conventions. Thus for postsecondary education program data, CIP and IPEDS must be treated together in constructing a crosswalk to ISCED. In ISCED, education levels are defined as: ... categories representing broad steps of educational progression from very elementary to more complicated learning experiences. 12 There are eight identified ISCED levels. An examinaticn of the level descriptions in the ISCED manual reveals that ISCED levels are operationally defined in terms of school years (grades) completed, or completion awards earned, where appropriate.' This is the same procedure followed in IPEDS. Because the ISCED operational definitions express educational levels in terms of age ranges and sequence of instruction, they can be translated into U.S. equivalents. Level definitions used in the CCD survey system to report primary and secondary education data are based upon school grade levels and thus are equally amenable to translation into ISCED levels. The Organization of Program Descriptions in CIP and ISCED CIP Organizational Structure. CIP program descriptions are organized into three categories of specificity. Individual program descriptions in CIP correspond to discrete instructional programs as offered in schools and other educational institutions. They are each assigned a unique 6-digit code. In the 1990 CIP there were 1,066 individual program d -scriptions assigned 6-digit codes. Second, the 6-digit codes/program descriptions are grouped into what are called Series, with each Series assigned a 4-digit code (the same as each 6-digit code within the Series minus the last two digits). There are 341 separate 4-digit Series codes in the 1990 CIP. These 4-digit Series are further grouped into a final set of Series, assigned a 2-digit code (the first two digits of the 4-digit Series code). The 1990 CIP contains 49 two-digit Series. A user of CIP who refers to a specific program description can instantly tell its location in the layered system of Series aggregations. Data collected via IPEDS that use CIP codes are reported at the 6-digit CIP code level of detail. The collected data are analyzed and published at different levels of deta .1 (Series or individual code) depending upon the nature of the study being conducted or the information request received. Typical CIP program descriptions look like this: 27. MATHEMATICS. A summary of groups of instructional programs that describe the systematic study of logical symbolic language and its applications. 27.01 Mathematics. A group of instructional pi ograms (see 27.0101)"}, {"section_title": "27.0101", "text": "Ii Ibid., pp. 5-12. Mathematics. An instructional program that describes the rigorous analysis of quantities, magnitudes, forms, and their relationships using symbolic logic and language. Includes instruction in algebra, calculus, functional analysis, geometry, number theory, logic, topology, and other mathematical specializations. The first description, numbered 27, is the 2-digit Series, followed by the 4-digit Series and the individual 6-digit code. In this example, all three layers of the classification \"mathematics\" possess the same title. CIP codes and Series are usually identified by means of their numerical designations. ISCED Organizational Structure. Each ISCED program description is assigned a 5-digit code. The first digit identifies the education level. Within the system of educational levels, ISCED defines programs by two categories: broad subject fields and program descriptions within the broad fields. (It should be noted that an ISCED program description, called a \"program group\" in the ISCED Manual, is really an aggregate description combining several programs that would be coded individually in CIP.) ISCED's broad fields are assigned a 2digit code and are as follows: Other Programmes Residual counts of programs are coded \"89\" at the broad field level and \"99\" at the program group/description level. Distinct sub-fields, such as allied health within the broad \"Medical and Health Programs\" field, are indicated in ISCED by assigning a different fourth digit to each such subfield code. Overall, the ISCED system contains 21 distinct broad field categories (repeated at various levels for a total of 107 level-specific field descriptions), and 520 level-specific program descriptions. ISCED broad fields and program groups are organized across eight different education levels. By level, the ISCED field and program counts are: Basing the Crosswalk on Six-Digit CIP Codes. While CIP and ISCED do not group program categories in precisely the same ways, the differences can be overcome. In both systems, the aggregated general categories are composed of collections of specific programs. In CIP the most specific category is coded into the system (6-digit level). The most specific ISCED category is not coded into the system, but is identified in the descriptions accompanying each ISCED program group. These descriptions indicate the specific programs that are meant to be included under each ISCED program group. Thus, the CIP 6digit program codes that belong in each ISCED program group can be determined. By constructing a crosswalk from the most specific level up to the general, it is possible to iuentify groupings of 6-digit CIP codes that directly and accurately correspond to ISCED program groups and broad fields. Using ISCED Rules to Insert Necessary Codes. In some cases, program data are reported in the United States at a level other than, or in addition to, the level at which a program is described in ISCED. For example, in the United States, art history is offered as an instructional program at the equivalent of ISCED Level 6, but no ISCED Level 6 code appears for it. An ISCED Level 7 code for art history does exist, however. ISCED rules permit such a problem to be resolved by inserting a Level 6 code for art history, using the code number as it appears (Level 7) but prefixed by \"6\" instead of \"7.\" So long as a program group code appears at some level in the ISCED system, it can be inserted where needed at any other level.' The ISCED code insertion rule accommodates national differences in educational practice and greatly reduces the number of unresolvable data placement problems. Any program data which do not fall under any extant ISCED code are placed in the \"other\" category at the end of each ISCED Level series. Maintaining Consistent Code Placements Across Levels. ISCED is structured according to a set of assumptions about where most countries offer various programs. These assumptions include education level, type of program, and content specificity. At each educational level, ISCED program descriptions state what kinds of subject matter are expected to be taught, at what level of detail, and what types of program outcome (degree/nondegree, academic/vocational, etc.) are likely. These assumptions make interpretation difficult, since no national system is arranged precisely according to the ISCED model. Unless care is taken, the result can be a crosswalk that is inconsistent across educational levels. The interpretation presented in this Guide makes every effort to avoid this problem. Chapters 3-10 contain an item-by-item discussion of how U.S. education program codes can be crosswalked into ISCED at each level, and vice versa."}, {"section_title": "U.S. and ISCED Educational Level Organization", "text": "The IPEDS and CCD data collection systems serve the function of distinguishing U.S. education data by level. CCD does this for primary and secondary data by grade level; IPEDS does so for postsecondary data by level of degree or other award. CCD Education Levels. CCD employs a grade structure that consists of prekindergarten (PK), kindergarten (K), and grades 1-12. Additional data categories exist for ungraded students and, for statewide data only, students with Individual Education Plans (IEPs). These additional categories encompass a variety of educational arrangements and services, including special education students (learning disabled and handicapped); students who take extra secondary credits after 12th grade; and students who pass secondary school equivalency examinations. Data reporting through CCD is done by individual grade level. Reporting data by grade level is necessary because the grade at which primary education is deemed to be completed and the grades identified as the local equivalent of lower secondary education (where the concept exists) vary from state to state. While each U.S. state sets a primary school completion point, there is no standard practice of awarding a certitkeate or other indication of 14 UNESCO. Each state is permitted to interpret the terms \"prekindergarten,\" \"kindergarten,\" \"elementary\" and \"secondary\" using its own laws and regulations. CIP Secondary Education Program Codes. The CIP system also recognizes a set of general secondary school program completions and includes codes for them in its Series 53. They correspond to the senior high school level (grades 9-12), and are as follows: U.S. practice recognizes all types of high school diploma as equivalent in terms of signifying secondary graduation. The content of the course of studies for each type of diploma varies by state, by school, and by individual recipient, since state laws frequently permit wide discretion in interpreting requirements. Postsecondary institutions impose entrance requirements that arc regularly published and updated which show what courses of study, and credits earned, in secondary programs are acceptable. \" Persons who did not complete regular secondary school may prepare for the High School Equivalence Certificate through the General Educational Development (GED) program. Upon completing the GED program and passing a comprehensive examination, individuals are awarded a certificate which is legally equivalent to a regular high school diploma. A Certificate of Cotnpetence indicates that a student has met specific performance standards in some special field, such as a vocational subject, academic subject rofter (languages, mathematics, etc.), or passed an achievement test. It is not equivalent to diploma award. A Certificate of fET Completion means that a student with a learning disability has completed a customized Individual Education Plan OEM. Whether an IEP represents a full secondary program These program descriptions are among the very few in CIP that may be used for reporting instructional program data below the postsecondary levels. The CIP definition of an instructional program refers to structured learning experiences that are composed of several component experiences (courses, fieldwork, laboratories, lectures), have defined entrance and completion points, and result in an award or other certification of completion. Most U.S. secondary school studies consist of subject-matter fields organized into courses, which are discrete modules lasting up to an academic year in length. Courses are not complete programs, and it is not intended that secondary students concentrate in a special field and thus complete a program. Instead, U.S. secondary education is structured around the, requirements for general diplomas, and these are the only sequences that qualify as instructional programs. Some states have recognized certain subject-matter foci, particularly in vocational fields, as secondary-level programs, but this is not a nationally consistent practice. CIP secondary program codes are not currently employed in the CCD survey. The CIP secondary program codes correspond, however, to the following CCD data categories: IPEDS Postsecondary Education Levels. Instructional programs that lead to contentspecific awards (degrees, diplomas, certificates, etc.) are the rule rather than the exception at the postsecondary level. Furthermore, these program completion points are reached by different students on different timetables, according to individual institutional program requirements on the one hand and student persistence on the other. For these reasons it is both meaningful and logical to report postsecondary program data, whether for enrollments or completions, by level of award. IPEDS assigns reported program data to one of 11 levels, corresponding to successive points of program completion and/or award. These levels are defined in Question 4 of the standard IPEDS survey instruments. IPEDS levels comprise a sequence of increasing distance from secondary school completion. Levels 1PD and 1PC are out of sequence because they refer to programs that are postbachelor's. Neither level 1PD or 1PC is equivalent to IPEDS level Doc, which denotes the research doctorate.' Data on programs that do not fall into the IPEDS level sequence, such as personal development, leisure, and basic adult education programs, are not currently collected. They are occasionally gathered using surveys with more limited objectives, such as the National Adult Literacy Survey. When CIP codes are used in such surveys there is no correspondence to the levels of formal education."}, {"section_title": "IS", "text": "Most of the degrees called \"first professional\" in U.S. terminology are labeled doctorates, such as Doctor of Medicine (MD), Doctor of Dental Science (DDS), Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD), and Doctor of Laws (JD), among others. None of the degrees in this special category is a research doctorate, however. Each represents a first degree in the subject studied and is considered a graduate-level degree only because a previous bachelor's degree or the equivalent had to be earned. Genuine graduate research degrees are awarded in most of these professional fields, but they are higher degrees. A complete list of the recognized first-professional degrees follows, accompanied by a partial listing of the most common graduate degrees in each field."}, {"section_title": "1PD Degree", "text": "Master's Degree Research Doctorate * May require only an Associate Degree as a prerequisite; in such cases the 1PD level is equivalent only to a single bachelor's degree. ** The further professional degree \"Doctor of Ministry (DMin)\" is frequently awarded after the MDiv. It is an advanced professional qualification and is not equivalent to a research doctorate. The category of first professional degree is limited to the eleven fields listed above and is thus not exhaustive of all professional fields nor of all degrees which could be styled \"first professional.\" Educational Levels Used in 1SCED. ISCED uses an educational level organization that is much simpler than the combined CCD and IPEDS systems. It comprises eight categories corresponding to broad ranges of educational development, as follows: An examination of the level descriptions in ISCED reveals that they are operationally defined in terms of school years (grades) completed, or completion awards earned, where appropriate.' IPEDS and other U.S. educational surveys define levels in the same way that ISCED does. The operational definitions of each of the ISCED levels are: 0 Education beginning at around ages 3-5, lasting 1-3 years. 1 Education beginning at ages 5, 6, or 7 and lasting for 5-6 years. [Note: Basic Adult Literacy data are also reported here under the ISCED system.] 2 Education beginning at around ages 11-12 and lasting for about 3 years. 3 Education beginning at around ages 14-15 and lasting for about 3 years."}, {"section_title": "5", "text": "Education beginning at about ages 17-18, lasting up to 3 years, and that often prepares persons for employment."}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "Education beginning at about ages 17-18, lasting around 4 years, and that prepares persons for postgraduate study or employment.  Out-of-school educational programs and experiences for which no explicit or implicit prerequisites exist, which are outside the core school or university system, and which are often parttime and of short duration. With allowances for the fact that these operational parameters were framed in the early to mid-1970s and reflect the then-current bias toward defining educational levels in terms of \"traditional\" school-age populations, they nonetheless correspond to recognizable stages that have U.S. equivalents."}, {"section_title": "Crosswalking between U.S. and ISCED Level Organizations", "text": "There is no particular difficulty in assigning U.S. levels of education to corresponding ISCED levels, or vice versa. The fact that the ISCED level assignments do not precisely correspond to U.S. postsecondary degree structure or to particular state-designated school levels is not an impediment since ISCED defines education levels in terms of yearequivalents of schooling completed, as do most U.S. systems. By concentrating on these successive and cumulative school-year equivalencies, one can derive the following comparable level descriptions: The Data to be Crosswalked A crosswalk is a guide for both coders and users of data. For coders, a crosswalk must permit the interpretation and accurate placement of all data that may exist in the database to be crosswalked. In order to accomplish this function, the crosswalk instructions must include placements for every data element in each system, regardless of whether actual data are collected for a specific data element at any given point in time. The fact that data are collectable requires crosswalk instructions, since not to do so would entail modifying the crosswalk every time the data change. Such piecemeal modifications are neither costeffective nor good statistical practice. Users of crosswalked data have other interests besides coding. Data interpretation, to users, also means knowing what data are actually available and why such data are assigned to one position in the crosswalk and not to another. A user's interest in empirical knowledge about the data is thus different from a coder's interest in accurate and complete guidance concerning what to do with data. The primary function of this Guide is to describe a crosswalk that enables U.S. education program data to be accurately reported using the ISCED classification system. The Guide has a second function as well, which is to indicate to users information about the data to be crosswalked. Both coders and other users will benefit from knowing which U.S. data codes are being used to report data as of the most recent reporting year (1990)(1991). They will also benefit from knowing about the additional U.S. program codes that correspond to each ISCED program group and that fall under two other categories: (1) existing codes for which data may be collected in different years, and (2) codes added to the 1990 CIP and which may be expected to result in data in the future. Chapter 2 contains decision rules and conventions concerning how this Guide distinguishes these types of codes. Such distinctions are listed in the discussion of each crosswalk category which appear in chapters 3-8. The chapter discussions also indicate why U.S. program codes are crosswalked to the ISCED system at particular levels. Both the chapters and the appendix also indicate, for those interested, which crosswalked data codes are collecting significant data."}, {"section_title": "Limitations on Comparability", "text": "It is technically possible to produce crosswalks from U.S. educational program and level structures to the ISCED system and to do so in a manner that is logical and consistent. The results of such an exercise will be reliable and valid within the limitations of the data and the data-coding categories used. While this document does not provide room for an adequate discussion of national or international data comparability problems, it is appropriate to remind the user of several general considerations. Factors Affecting U.S. Data. The tremendous variety inherent in U.S. educational institutions and systems, compounded by the federal political structure and the internal governance structures for education in each U.S. jurisdiction, result in internal complexities that in many respects mirror international data problems. Technical definitions, conventions, reporting standards, formulae, analysis procedures, and publication conventions differ across (and often within) states, districts, and institutions. National data based on uniform criteria can be obtained only for items presented in nationwide surveys to which respondents agree to follow standardized reporting guidelines, and thus will not always match data reported under local guidelines, different survey methodologies, and other collections. Any aggregation of data that is presented as a national statistical portrait will be valid only within whatever parameters surround the data collected for it. Initiatives and agreements are constantly in progress to achieve wider standardization of terms, definitions, and formulae, but this process is necessarily lengthy. The complexity that characterizes U.S. education data affects the construction of a \"national\" portrait of U.S. educational activity. Efforts to generalize about U.S. national educational activity cannot extrapolate the experience of a single U.S. state to the whole country, or simply sum individual states' published data. These caveats are not data quality limitations per se, but rather reflect the organization and governance of American education. Each country that reports data for comparative purposes through ISCED possesses a unique set of such caveats. This is why such data represent only an approximation of the educational activity in the world, and are useful primarily for general information. Factors Affecting ISCED. ISCED contains fewer program descriptions and level distinctions than actually exist in U.S. practice or in the practice of many other nations that employ the ISCED system in reporting data internationally. Also, the arrangement of ISCED program groups at different levels differs from that prevailing in the United States anu other countries. The fact that ISCED rarely matches the education program data classification used by a specific country necessitates adaptation whenever ISCED is used to report national data. A situation thus arises whereby data reported via ISCED program groups and levels may not accurately reflect what goes on inside the educational system that is purportedly described by those adapted data. Indeed, some data may be placed, for ISCED reporting purposes, into categories that have no meaning in the national system for which they are reported. The result is that education program data reported under the ISCED system may be useful as general descriptive information but do not necessarily represent a detailed or even accurate picture of a specific nation's national educational degree structure, sequence, or program activity."}, {"section_title": "Interpretation and Use of Crosswalked Data", "text": "Domestic data collected by CCD and IPEDS (the latter using CIP codes) are descriptive of U.S. educational activity, and may be used in analyses of trends in such areas as enrollments and completions. These data do not answer questions related to the quality of the educational activity thus observed or the standards involved in the certification of given levels of achievement. Likewise, ISCED is a descriptive statistical tool that cannot be used to compare the process and quality of educational systems and programs. Program and level characteristics differ widely both between and within countries. A U.S./ISCED crosswalk is useful in comparing statistics about aggregate trends and even organization but is insufficient by itself to address issues such as the equivalence of program and degree content, academic standards, or system quality. Particular concern surrounds the problems presented by three U.S. educational program completions: secondary graduation, less-than-4-year postsecondary programs, and the bachelor's degree. Neither American nor foreign educational authorities regard these U.S. completion awards as directly equivalent to some foreign secondary school completion awards that are treated, in the ISCED system, as similar. The foreign examples most frequently cited are the upper-level European academic secondary graduation awards (such as the French Baccalaureat, German Abitur, English Sixth Form/A Levels, and others), and the first-university degrees in countries whose postsecondary systems follow the European university model. Both these degree levels and their U.S. counterparts must now be reported at the same ISCED Level because the ISCED system possesses no means of fine-grained disaggregation. There is no way to avoid an appearance of spurious equivalency under current international classification rules, since ISCED itself does not provide for the fine-grained level breakouts that would be needed to separate such awards. Nor does ISCED address issues such as the differences in curriculum content, standards, and intensity of study that mark the real distinctions between various secondary and postsecondary programs in different countries. Decentralized, market-oriented educational systems, such as the American, exhibit inherent internal variations and inconsistencies. These variations are accepted within the society as a trade-off between the competing principles of national consistency and unity, on the one hand, and avoidance of excessive political intrusion into local life by national policymakers, on the other. To those outside the society, however, confusion and frustration can result from the inability to make safe generalizations about important aspects of such a system, particularly things like the uniformity and quality of its credentials. Notwithstanding these difficulties, decentralized systems possess identifiable characteristics that permit them not only to function well in spite of such diversity but to take advantage of the flcxibility and resiliency that also inheres within a system driven both by market and political forces. Likewise, educational systems which are nationally centralized or at least more closely regulated possess internal variations despite the outward appearance of uniformity, and these patterns make it difficult sometimes impossible to generalize about them. Many such systems possess more than one type of secondary and/or postsecondary track, very complex degree structures and multiple paths to the same credential, and differentiated institutional structures with separate academic cultures and governance structures. Furthermore, quality is not necessarily uniform throughout centralized educational systems, despite frequent official claims to the contrary. The point is that both formality and informality can produce similar pitfalls for cross-national comparisons; one is not necessarily preferable to the other on grounds of clarity, simplicity, or consistency. Whether educational systems are more or less centralized, broad designations and national standards may not reflect what occurs in any particular educational institution and obviously do not reflect the actual experience of any specific individual. Differences of educational philosophy, program content, teaching methods, and learning styles exist even where formal structures are superficially similar, and render comparative analyses difficult. ISCED's purpose is to place the programmatic and institutional data-reporting categories of national education systems into a consistent framework in order to permit analyses of broad educational trends. Inevitably, this means that some precision is lost, as local definitions and practices are ignored. It also means, certainly, that some questions which aggregate des,criptive and trend data cannot answer lie outside this system. On the other hand, ISCED is a powerful tool for observing general transnational activity in agreed-upon categories of level and program type. Various proposals have been made, and some have been implemented, to overcome the effect of collapsing data on unlike degree levels into the same broad ISCED levels. Each ISCED level can be broken out into sublevels by assigning each ISCED level a two-digit code, as is being done in the United States and by the International Association of Universities (IAU).\" This permits a breakout of each ISCED level into as many as nine sublevels (with a 10th position for unclassifiable data), thus permitting more detailed distinctions between degree levels than the basic ISCED system allows. Data organized under these sublevels can be aggregated to produce a standard ISCED format as necessary. Another solution is to modify the ISCED system itself by adding the two currently missing levels, 4 and 8. This possibility has been discussed internationally and would entail reorganizing the contents of the levels.' If a reorganization of ISCED levels were t_onsidered, Levels 1-3 could remain as they are, but the other levels would be changed by the insertion of 4 and 8. No reorganization plan has come under active consideration, however, and so this solution remains speculative at this time. Level reorganization is a conservative alternative to even more radical proposals to create a replacement for ISCED."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "None of the problems associated with developing a U.S./ISCED crosswalk are insurmountable, nor do they negate the value of such a crosswalk.

Data collected through CCD on U.S. high school completions, and on enrollments at all grade levels, produce large counts each year due to the numbers of American students enrolled in school. IPEDS education program data, on the other hand, vary in count from Year to year and from program to program. Some programs assigned CIP codes, such as English and general business administration, are popular postsecondary concentrations at nearly all levels and generate large numbers of completions and awards annually. Others, such as professional qualifications in law and medicine, are not offered at all postsecondary levels but generate steady and fairly large completion counts at certain levels. Still other programs, including many technical and academic specializations, generate only small counts and may fluctuate from year to year. This Guide attempts to inform users of the most recent data patterns for each CIP code and IPEDS level in order to enhance understanding of U.S. educational activity. Defining Significant Program Data. NCES periodically updates the CIP system to insure that data are being collected which accurately reflect what is occuring in the U.S. postsecondary universe. Data need to be collected for all programs in which there is enough activity (enrollments and completions) to justify collection efforts, both statistically and economically. The decision rules employed to do this and which are used in this Guide to define programs reporting significant activity are: An annual production of at least 10 completions at a specific IPEDS level; and An annual production distributed over at least three institutions located in at least one state or territory. Three other degrees of productivity exist: programs producing insignificant completion data in a given year at a given level; programs producing no completion data in a given year at a given level, but which are known to be offered by institutions at that level; and programs for which no data exist at a given level because no institutions report offering such programs at the level in question. Identifying Codes Producing Significant Data. Chapters 3-10 discuss each CIP code, at each IPEDS level, that corresponds to a particular ISCED code at each ISCED level. These chapters present a list of all CIP codes corresponding to each ISCED code and level. The CIP codes thus identified are grouped by IPEDS level to enable users of this Guide to see patterns in the array of data at each educational level. CIP codes for which significant data are being reported are printed in bold type, thus: 23.0101: English Language and Literature, General. CIP codes for which insignificant data are being reported are printed in italics, thus: 16.1199: Middle Eastern Languages and Literatures, Other. In chapters 3-10, CIP codes for which no data are being reported are not listed. Such codes are listed in the appendix, however, for they are necessary components of the master crosswalk used by data coders. Refer to the appendix for lists of these additional CIP codes and below for a discussion of how the master crosswalk is organized. For detailed information on U.S. education program codes and the U.S. coding system. refer to the Classification of Instructional Programs: 1990Edition (WashiAgton: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1991. Treatmect of Specific IPEDS Levels. Certair IPEDS levels that are included in the data system for statistical purposes do not produce much data because the degrees or other awards they represent either do not exist or are rarely earned. These levels include: PBC Postbaccalaureate Certificate, PMC Post-Master's Certificate, and 1PC First-Professional Certificate (Post-Degree). IPEDS level PBC is discussed in chapter 8, while levels PMC and 1PC are discussed in chapter 9. In the. case of PBC and PMC awards, lists are provided of those few CIP codes for which significant data are reported. Since no 1PC awards are known to be offered, and no data are reported, this level is ignored in the chapter 9 data presentations. All three levels are included in the Master Crosswalk for statistical and coding purposes (see appendix). At the sub-bachelor's degree level the IPEDS data collection system identifies four levels: Each of these levels reports substantial data and represents a different program level, and each is included in the Master Crosswalk (see appendix). However, these four levels may also be viewed as encompassing two broad levels of education. Short programs leading to no degree or the equivalent, but which may award certificates or diplomas, correspond to both levels LT1 and LT2. Longer programs that lead to an associate's degree or the equivalent correspond to levels Asc and LT4. Because data users may be more interested in these broad educational levels and patterns, and for reasons of space and cost, levels LT1/LT2 and Asc/LT4 are combined and discussed together in chapter 7. In each case, programs reporting significant data at either or both of the combined levels are presented. These levels are treated separately for coding and statistical purposes."}, {"section_title": "Appendix Conventions", "text": "Reading the Crosswalk Appendix. The master crosswalk matrix is presented in the appendix. It is subdivided into eight sections corresponding to each ISCED Level. Each section is organized by the ISCED broad codes contained within it, with the program group codes listed under each broad code in numerical order. The titles of these ISCED codes are not given in the appendix since they have been presented in chapters 3-10 and are known to users familiar with the international system. To the right of each ISCED code, in numerical order, are presented the U.S. program codes corresponding to it. These will be either CCD or CIP codes, depending on the educational level. At the top of each section are listed the CCD or IPEDS level codes corresponding to the ISCED Level indicated. Users of the appendix are reminded that it contains all potential crosswalkable program codes at all levels, not just those for which data are currently being reported. This approach is required to enable data coders to possess a map of every possible data placement. If U.S. institutions indicate that a specific program is offered at a given level, then a position for any resulting completion data must be assigned. (If no U.S. institutions report offering a program at a particular ISCED level, it is not listed in the appendix at that level.) It would be methodologically improper to introduce bias or otherwise limit the crosswalk based on assumptions about data significance which might vary over time or due to other valid circumstances. Users interested in discovering which ISCED or U.S. programs are actually generating consistently high numbers of completions at different levels are invited to consult the discussions in chapters 3-10. CIP Codes in the Appendix Followed by an Asterisk (*). CIP codes listed in the crosswalk appendix which have an asterisk (*) located behind them are codes for which NCES is currently collecting significant data. (Refer to the definition of significant data elsewhere in this chapter.) Use of the Symbol \"N/A.\" Wherever this symbol appears in the crosswalk matrix, it stands foi \"not applicable,\" which means that no U.S. data exist which correspond to the ISCED code in question. ISCED Codes Preceded by a Carrot (>). ISCED codes listed in the crosswalk appendix which are preceded by a carrot (>) are codes which have had to be inserted using ISCED rules in order to report U.S. data corresponding to that code at the level in question. Thus, an ISCED code (less the level number) may have a carrot at some levels but not at others. (Refer to chapters 3-10 for discussions of inserted ISCED codes.)"}, {"section_title": "Decision Rules", "text": "Chapter 3 (see below) discusses how the crosswalk's decision rules have been implemented in specific situations. The rules themselves are set forth here. Where ISCED rules and organization are explicit and permit no flexibility, they govern the placement of U.S. codes. This decision rule is necessary in order to produce data categories that make sense to international users who depend upon ISCED concepts, and it means that several U.S. education program Series must be broken up. Where ISCED rules and organization permit flexibility, U.S. data standards are used. The designers of ISCED expect that each country that uses it will need to work out compromises between domestic data reporting standards and the ISCED system, and ISCED rules generally allow for such adaptations. Wherever possible, this crosswalk places U.S. data codes consistently across ISCED levels. In other words, if a CIP code is placed under ISCED code 14 (teacher education) at one level (such as level 6), it is placed under code 14 at all other levels where data exist (such as level 7 graduate degrees, in this example). The ISCED rule that permits the insertion of codes at levels other than those provided in the system is invoked wherever necessary in order to report U.S. data in the most accurate and consistent manner. For example, ISCED has a code for foreign language interpreting at level 5 (corresponding to U.S. community and junior college), but not at level 6 (4-year college) or 7 (graduate school). All reported U.S. degree programs in interpretation and translation are offered at level 6 or 7, not level 5. Using the ISCED code insertion rule, we insert the code for interpreting at the higher levels in order to accurately report U.S. practice. Where the ISCED system is inconsistent in assigning programs to its program groups at different levels, this problem is resolved by interpreting each ISCED program group, across all levels, as corresponding to the sum of all of the programs which are assigned to it at all levels. The ISCED system contains numerous situations in which the same program group code is assigned to different levels, but the exact title and the contents differ from level to level. An example is ISCED program group code 5002, which rang,ts from auxiliary health workers at level 3 to public health professionals at level 6. In order to maintain data consistency, cases like this example are dealt with by identifying the common thematic program gm aping that cuts across levels. Thus, the example 5002 is interpreted to mean public/community health programs at various levels. In order to be accurate and consistent, both the crosswalk discussion presented in chapter 3, part 2 and the crosswalk matrix presented in the appendix are keyed to 6-digit CIP codes. In some cases, however, entire CIP 2-or 4-digit Series may be crosswalked to a given ISCED code. This situation occurs in cases where all the 6-digit CIP codes for a particular Series happen to correspond to the same ISCED Program Group Code at the same ISCED Level. The appendix presents a crosswalk of all CIP codes for which data may be reported under a given ISCED code at a given ISCED level, not merely those currently producing significant data. This rule must be applied to the master crosswalk matrix in order to permit data coders and statisticians to accomodate all possible data elements and to anticipate data pattern fluctuations. Crosswalking Data from ISCED to U.S. Systems In the majority of cases, data presented in an ISCED format may be directly crosswalked into comparable U.S. formats. The major limitation is that it is possible only to crosswalk ISCED data into broad groupings of U.S. grade and degree levels. Program categories, whether based on CCD or CIP, are basically similar with few exceptions. The problems categories are: Vocational Home Economics (CIP 20.), split up with certain 6-digit codes assigned to trades and industries and service categories; Marketing Operations (CIP 08.), split up among business and service categories; Agriculture (CIP 01. and 02.) combined; and Trades and Industries (CIP 47.,48.,and 49.) and Personal Services (CIP 12.) rearranged to a limited degree (primarily lumping \"other\" codes together and splitting off individual codes). Other minor rearrangements occur, such as when ISCED treats as a separate data element what is a single 6-digit CIP code but does not split the code away from the rest of its Series and position it elsewhere. Collectively, these differences result in a loss of data specificity and, from a U.S. perspective, data quality. They do not render crosswalking from ISCED impossible, however, so long as it is recognized that some data treated in separate detail in the U.S. will be impossible to isolate, and twu data categories vocational home economics and marketing operations will not be reconstructable at all. In most other cases a crosswalk from ISCED will produce comparable data categories and will thus be usable for purposes of general descriptions and trend analyses. Comparisons of different countries' data, once both are crosswalked into ISCED format, are not affected by these problems as long as each set of data to be compared has been crosswalked according to a similar interpretation of the ISCED system."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 3 Crosswalking ISCED Broad Field Codes", "text": "This chapter contains a discussion, in order, of every ISCED broad field code and the U.S. codes that correspond to it. The rationales for each crosswalk decision are explained. Refer to chapters 440 for a discussion of each ISCED program group code by level. CIP codes and Series are crosswalked to ISCED codes only when U.S. data for them exist and ISCED provides a place for the data to be reported. This means that while all CIP codes are accounted for somewhere in the crosswalk, they are not all used at each ISCED level."}, {"section_title": "General Programmes", "text": "ISCED uses the 01 field to report any data on general or undifferentiated instructional programs at each level. Such data are operationally defined as programs that cannot be located in any specific category, nor be located in the \"other\" category which is reserved for both specific programs not elsewhere classified and unknowns. For example, a general or undifferentiated program in art (CIP 50.0701) would not belong in the 01 field, since it is a type of art program; it would be reported under broad field 18, fine and applied arts. Likewise a program in science, technology and society (CIP 30.1501), for which no specific ISCED field assignment exists at any level, would be reported under field 89 other programs, because it is a specific known type of program. A liberal or general studies program (CIP Series 24.01) would be reported under ISCED field 01, however, because no other assignment can be made for it and it specifically refers to general programs of study. Field 01 is also used to report aggregate data on educational activities that are not defined by program or subject, such as data on enrollments and completions at specific grade levels and degree levels. An example would be all CCD data, since these are not program-specific. CCD data are level-specific, however, and thus aggregate CCD data corresponding to the appropriate ISCED level would be reported for that level under the 01 field code. Likewise, CCD and IPEDS data referring to generic secondary or postsecondary diplomas or certificates would be reported here, since they are not program-or subject-specific. The 01 field cuts across all ISCED levels and is applicable wherever there is a need to report data on aggregate, general, or generic activity.\nAlso, as with other grades in the U.S. PK-12 sequence, subject-matter or course-taking activity data are not routinely collected for U.S. senior high school programs.\" Vocational preparation is offered at this level in those trades and occupations for which a high school diploma is considered adequate preparation under the regulations of a specific state's licensing authorities.

This field name is sometimes used to describe a program of religious study and preparation for Jewish community service vocations; at other times it is used to describe a program of cultural studies having no direct religious preparatory function. Since the data do not permit precise identification of the two types of program using this title and because the subject of study in either case is defined as a religious/cultural community, the code is included under the \"other\" humanities program group listing. \nU.S. graduate programs in the visual and performing arts consist of both academic and professionally oriented offerings. The instructional activity takes place in colleges and universities as well as independent schools (academies, conservatories) specializing in one or more of the arts. *71801. General Programmes of Art Studies.* This program group code needs to be inserted at ISCED level 7 (it appears at levels 5 and 6) in order to report data accurately on U.S. art programs at the graduate level which do not specify the subfield of concentration. Intensive, specialized, and professional study of the humanities in the United States occurs at the graduate level. This study builds upon the broad multidisciplinary foundation laid at the bachelor's degree level as well as the focused introduction to the study of a humanities (or related) field provided through the undergraduate major. Most graduate programs in the humanities focus on preparing professional scholars, although an increasing emphasis on alternative career preparation has emerged in recent years in light of the limited academic job market. While this crosswalk follows ISCED practice, it should be noted that in the U.S. religious studies and art studies programs (art history, music history, drama studies, film studies, general visual/performing arts studies) are considered to be humanities subjects, and their program data would be reported domestically in this category. *72201. General Programmes in the Humanities.* This program group code need-, to be inserted at ISCED level 7 (it appears at levels 5 and 6) in order to report data accurately on U.S. humanities programs at the graduate level which are interdisciplinary in character. Programs in religious studies and the theological vocations are reported separately inside the United States, but are combined here following ISCED practice. Graduate-level religious studies programs are classified as part of the academic humanities and typically lead to the award of research degrees (MA, PhD). Programs at the graduate level in the religious vocations may be first-professional degrees leading to rabbinical, priestly, or ministerial ordination; advanced professional practice credentials (master's or professional doctorates, especially the degree \"Doctor of Ministry\" (DMin)) in some vocational specialty; or research degrees (MA, ThM, PhD, ThD) in theology, biblical studies, or another field. As stated in previous chapters, direct graduate level vocational preparation for religious occupations is provided only by private colleges, seminaries, and universities. Public institutions offer graduate programs in the academic study of religion but not in religious training per se.\" 72600. Religion and Theology Programmes. This program group code corresponds to U.S. data reported for graduate programs in religion and the theological vocations. The observations made about humanities programs at the U.S. equivalent of ISCED level 7 (see broad field 722, above) also apply to social sciences programs. *73001. General Programmes in the Social and Behavioural Sciences.* This program group code needs to be inserted at ISCED level 7 (it appears at levels 5 and 6) in order to report data accurvely on U.S. social sciences programs at the graduate level which are interdiscipr nary in character. U.S. business administration degrees at the master's degree level are predominantly professional in character. This is especially true of the \"master's of business administration\" (MBA) degree, which is designed for persons seeking immediate employment in managerial positions. Business doctorates are research oriented more often than not, as are master's degrees in some fields such as business economics, quantitative methods, and research. Master's, specialist, and doctoral degrees in educational administration may be practice or research oriented, depending upon the focus of a particular institution's program and the study plan of a particular student. Graduate degrees in health administration and public administration follow the same pattern as in education. *73401. General Programmes in Business Administration.* This program group code should be inserted at level 7 (it appears only at levels 5 and 6) to report data accurately and consistently for U.S. graduate programs in business administration which prepare management generalists or which specify no concentration. It corresponds to: U.S. programs in law corresponding to ISCED level 7 include both first-professional degrees in law and advanced degrees. The first-professional degree in law is called Juris Doctor (JD); it was formerly called a bachelor of laws (LLB). First-professional law degrees are not specialist in nature. Specialization typically comes later, after a degree earner has been admitted to practice, obtained a job, and begun to focus on a career path. Master's degrees in law either prepare specialist practitioners or serve as an intermediate research qualification, depending on the program and the goals of the student. Most master's degrees in law are abbreviated LLM, but the abbreviation MCL is also encountered. This latter abbreviation stands for \"master of comparative law\" and is a degree awarded to foreign lawyers and scholars completing an advanced introductory program in U.S. law, and less frequently to U.S. holders of the JD degree who complete a program in the study of a foreign legal system or systems. The research doctorate in law is the Doctor of Juridical Science (SJD or JSD The following listing corresponds to those U.S. program codes in these categories for which data at this level are reported. Some allied health programs are offered at the graduate level, reflecting the increasing complexity and knowledge requirements in these occupations as well as the need to prepare persons with expertise in the fields who can manage support operations within hospitals and other health care facilities. First-professional degrees in dentistry, medicine, and other health professions are reported at this level. As with law (see broad field 722), first-professional degrees in the health professions are primarily generalist in content. Specialization occurs during the internship, in post-degree residencies, and at the research degree level. Medical research degrees are the same as those in the sciences, the master's (MS, standing for \"master of science,\" not surgery) and research doctorate (PhD). First-professional degrees use the term \"doctor\" in the title (MD, DDS, OD, DPM, PharmD, DC) but are not equivalent to research doctorates (or master's degrees, either) and should not be confused with advanced credentials in the medical sciences. Master's and doctorates in the health treatment fields, such as nursing, public health, rehabilitation, and others, may be practice or research oriented depending on the program and the goals of the student. *75002.

The United States does separate these two distinct types of religious study. For ISCED reporting purposes, however, data collected via IPEDS and CIP oi, religion and theology program activity (CIP Series 38.02,38.99,and 39.) are combined and reported under broad field 26.\nPrograms in the academic study of religion and preparation for religious vocations are reported separately inside the United States, but are combined here following ISCED practice. Public institutions, such as community and junior colleges, offer only academic programs in religious studies; these are normally classified as a part of the humanities. Private institutions offer both types of programs. Both public and private sub-bachelor's institutions also prepare individuals to enter 4-year programs that either train persons directly for theological vocations or prepare them for graduate-level programs. Degree requirements for theological ordination as a priest, pastor, rabbi, or other clergy vary depending upon the regulations of the faith community in question. The pattern varies from no degree requirement at all to a second degree at the graduate (post-graduate) level. Religious vocations other than ordained clergy (musicians, educators, counselors, lay religious, missionaries, and others) are even less predictable as to educational level.' 52600.

Furthermore, the automation of business offices has reduced or eliminated the presence of non-computer equipment (mechanical typewriters, mimeographs, and others) and the need to train personnel in their use. 53426. Programmes in Electronic Data Processing. Electronic data processing actually includes a wider variety of programs than the title suggests, ranging from word processing and data entry to the management of business computer facilities and the planning and design of business-specific computer applications (software and hardware).

Biological Science Programmes. This program group code as defined in ISCED corresponds to data reported on the entire range of biological science programs, which is an extensive and growing list. At the sub-bachelor's degree level the main program offerings are in general biology at the associate degree level, although some of the more specialized titles occasionally appear. These programs either prepare biological laboratory or research assistants or prepare students to continue their studies at the bachelor's degree level. ISCED code 54202 includes: The following listing corresponds to those U.S. program codes in these categories for which data at this level are reported. As with law, ISCED assumptions about health professions training do not correspond to domestic U.S. practice. Virtually all U.S. health occupations training is postsecondary, not secondary. Also the increased reliance on high-tech equipment and an increased reliance on allied health professionals instead of nurses and physicians has resulted in a gradual increase in the level of education required for licensure in these occupational fields. Because these fields, and the educational qualifications deemed necessary for them, are in flux there are variations in how state licensing authorities, professional associations, and institutions approach the matter of program content and level. Many health care programs are now offered, and completed, at both ISCED levels 5 and 6, as well as at level 7. These facts have required an examination of ISCED health and medical codes across all postsecondary levels (5-7) in order to determine where specific U.S. programs should be reported. . programs training practical nurses (general care workers with limited licenses), and programs training nursing assistants and aides. Registered nurses are also trained in bachelor's degree programs; the professional curricula for both levels is the same but the ancillary \"liberal arts\" general subjects are only required at the bachelor's level.

Short programs in the advanced nursing sp..,alities, which are occasionally reported, are not full training programs but rather similarly titled programs training specialized assistants or providing professional refresher training.

Such programs may be preparatory or general programs for assistants or students planning professional studies; full professional programs are offered only at the bachelor's degree and higher levels. In the ISCED system, this broad field includes programs related to veterinary medicine, whereas such programs are placed in the health professions and related sciences in U.S. data reporting. ISCED also combines forestry (which it defines to include wildlife management) and fishing programs with agriculture under this broad field, while U.S. classification practice separates them.

This category may be distinguished from public administration in that it focuses on programs that prepare facilities and services managers rather than government administrators, policy analysts, or public finance experts.

This ISCED field reflects the widespread approach to legal education as a first-degree or undergraduate postsecondary subject and the provision of specific programs for the different occupations within the legal system (judge, magistrate, trial attorney, solicitor, prosecutor, notary, etc.). American legal preparation, in contrast, is at the level of post-bachelor's degree education; it is generic to all types of jobs requiring an attorney qualification and not specific to any of them. The only types of legal education below the graduate level in the United States are undergraduate pre-law school preparatory programs and training programs for paralegals and other support staff. Since ISCED field 38 does not follow the organization of U.S. legal education, it is difficult to place U.S. data accurately into the existing ISCED subfield categories. To report U.S. data as accurately as possible, a code for \"general\" law programs must be inserted at level 7 (a general code appears in the basic ISCED system only at level 6).

Administrative and supervisory programs that have a clinical care component, however, such as ward clerks and supervisors, are reported under ISCED field 50. ISCED does not provide a subfield code for reporting medical laboratory technicians. At Level 6 ISCED introduces a program group code for medical technologists that clearly incorporates laboratory medicine. To avoid inconsistent data assignment across levels, and in order to provide a logical place for data on programs that train persons who assist medical technologists and otherwise work in medical laboratories, the Level 6 medical technology code is inserted at other levels. Other problems in field 50 involve the need to insert various subfield codes at additional levels in order to reflect U.S. educational practice accurately (for example: U.S. medicine degrees are graduate-level awards) and to place certain CIP Series (such as communications disorders, chiropractic, osteopathy, and optometry) in the \"other\" subfield since ISCED assigns them no code.

ISCED defines this program group to exclude all aviation transportation programs other than flight crew training. Consequently, the only data to be reported here are for the following U.S. air crew programs: ISCED uses this broad field to report data on a variety of classified programs as well as \"other\" or \"unknown\" programs.

First, several professional bachelor's degree programs are longer than 4 years, including architecture (5 or 6 years), engineering (going to 5 years), and pharmacy (5 years). Second, research has demonstrated that students in other concentrations are tending to take longer than 4 years to complete the degree. Currently the mean time taken to earn a \"4year\" bachelor's degree in any subject is approximately 5.5 calendar years.\" ISCED requires the basic undergraduate, or \"first\" degree awarded by universities or equivalent institutions, to be reported at this level. The bachelor's degree fits that description in the United States and represents completion of a full undergraduate program of studies, which includes a concentration in at least one subject field. U.S. bachelor's degrees may or may not be equivalent to other first-university degrees, depending on the content and quality of an individual student's prior schooling and the content and quality of the bachelor's degree program being pursued at a given institution. These issues are not regulated in the United States at the national level and are outside the scope of the ISCED system. Therefore, no official guidance about the equivalency of any individual U.S. or foreign degree program is intended or should be inferred by this statistical interpretation of level 6. The Postbaccalaureate Certificate. Postbaccalaureate certificates are infrequently awarded; when they are, they tend to represent an extra semester or more of work that enables a student to meet a professional requirement or earn credit for some academic specialization. 26 See Nabeel Alsalam and Gayle Thompson Rogers, The Condition of Education 1991 Vol. 2: Postsecondary Education, (Washington: U.S. Government Printing Office, June 1991), Indicator 2.6, pp.30-31 and 124-125. Time-tobachelor's degree varies by field as well as by characteristics of the student population. As of 1986 data, only 45.5 percent of all respondents to the national Recent College Graduates Survey (RCG) reported taking 4 years or less to complete a bachelor's degree. The majority took between 4 and 6 years, while 27 percent took over 6 years. Examples include earning the credits required for an entry-level teaching certificate; gaining credit for specialized computer skills; or obtaining a certificate of specialization in a subject such as a foreign language or area studies. Each of these examples pertains to an undergraduate program which is completed subsequent to earning the bachelor's degree, and therefore does not represent graduate-level study. Since relatively few postbaccalaureate certificates are awarded, the following list presents the CIP codes for which significant PBC level IPEDS data are reported, together with the corresponding ISCED codes. 61401. General Teacher-Training Programmes. This program group code corresponds to data collected on unspecialized programs in education and programs that prepare students for teacher certification by grade level rather than by subject area. introduction to the study of the field of concentration designed to provide either a terminal academic experience or the groundwork for further study and research. The generalized character of U.S. undergraduate liberal arts programs is useful for both aims, for it permits the humanities major to augment the introduction to the major field with other appropriate studies. Examples of such undergraduate combinations could include such subjects as business or pre-law (for someone planning to enter a professional program); science or engineering (for someone planning to combine technical expertise with scholarly research); or foreign languages and the social sciences (for someone preparing to enter graduate school in a humanties discipline). While this crosswalk follows ISCED practice, it should be noted that in the U.S. religious studies and art studies programs (art history, music history, drama studies, film studies, general visual/performing arts studies) are considered to be humanities subjects and their program data would be reported domestically in this category. group code corresponds to data reported for U.S. programs in modern foreign languages at the bachelor's degree level. Foreign language programs at this level are designed to introduce students to a language and its literature, to build competency, and to prepare interested students for further study. This ISCED broad field is the appropriate place to report data on U.S. bachelor's degree programs in business-related fields as well (as defined in ISCED) as public administration and administrative services related to schools, health care, and non-profit organizations. Some marketing operations program data (CIP Series 08.) are also reported here, specifically those data relating to general retailing and wholesaling services. Bachelor's degree business programs prepare students for immediate job entry or for further study. In many cases the programs are similar in content to longer business programs at the less-than-4-year level (level 5), with the addition of the general education requirements characteristic of U.S. bachelor's degrees. Business programs thus share with health care programs (see broad fields 550 and 650) the tendency to be offered at both degree levels, with the distinction being that the bachelor's degree programs represent completion of a full undergraduate course of studies. Students earning bachelor's degrees in business outnumber those earning bachelor's degrees in any other subject field.\" U.S. bachelor's degrees in the medical records fields follow the pattern discussed above for business degrees; they are longer counterparts of the corresponding associate's degree programs.

As with business (see broad fields 534 and 634), there is a tendency for many allied health fields to be offered at both the bachelor's and associate's degree levels. The increased reliance on high-tech equipment and an increased reliance on allied health professionals and nurses instead of physicians in primary care situations has resulted in a gradual increase in the level of education required for licensure in these occupational fields. Many health care programs are now offered, and completed, at all three ISCED postsecondary levels (5,6, and 7). U.S. professional degrees in architecture and urban planning are awarded at both the bachelor's and graduate levels. Bachelor's degree programs in architecture require from 5 to 6 years of study; the time for degrees in planning varies according to whether they are offered as architecture programs (preparatory to licensure) or not. The programs listed here prepare students for entry-level professional practice and for further study. "}, {"section_title": "General Programmes in", "text": "\n*67002. Air Crew Progranunes.* This program group code should be inserted at level 6 (it appears only at level 5) to report data accurately and consistently for U.S. undergraduate programs preparing flight crew for long-range commercial airlines.

Ships' Officer Programmes.* This program group code should be inserted at level 6 (it appears only at level 5) to report data accurately and consistently for U.S. undergraduate programs preparing merchant marine officers. U.S. merchant marine personnel are trained at both the bachelor's and less-than-4-year levels; the former programs provide more extensive grounding in both academic and practical subjects and lead to more responsible positions on larger vessels or in shore management, as well as preparing students for possible further study. ISCED code 67004 includes: First-Professional Degree 1PC First-Professional Certificate (Post-Degree) The format for this section follows that used for levels 5 and 6 (see chapters 7 and 8). ISCED collapses all data on postgraduate (the U.S. term is graduate) studies into a single category: level 7. For U.S. reporting purposes this means that level 7 data include what are called first-professional degrees in addition to the universally recognized master's and research doctorate degree categories. The First-Professional Degree. First-professional degrees are entry-level qualifications required of persons seeking to be licensed to practice certain professions. They may, in addition, qualify students to seek admission to graduate-level research programs in the same or a related field. First-professional degrees are professional qualifications that can be earned only after the bachelor's degree or its equivalent has been achieved but are nevertheless considered initial degrees in a given professional practice field. They are, therefore, graduate level only in that they require prior completion of other undergraduate studies, but are not research degrees in their fields nor equivalent to graduate research degrees in other fields. Confusion sometimes arises because a number of U.S. firstprofessional degrees use the term \"doctor\" in the title. First-professional degrees are currently recognized in the fields of law, theology, and various health professions. Other graduate-level professional programs and awards are not designated \"first-professional\" even though they are not research oriented. These include many master's and some doctoral degrees in education, business administration, certain health professions (such as nursing and allied health fields), engineering, architecture, and (religious) ministry. Since the titles of the degree awards in these fields do not necessarily reflect the kind oc program completed or always represent the first credential earned in the field, these programs have not been designated first-professional. The First-Professional Certificate. This award level was created at the same time as was the first-professional degree level. No data, to date, have ever been reported under it. For this reason, it is ignored in chapter 9 but is retained in the appendix for purposes of crosswalking any future data. The Master's Degree. Master's degrees are the second full degree awarded by U.S. colleges and universities and may be earned in either academic or professional fields. In the case of fields recognized as awarding first-professional degrees, the master's degree follows the first-professional qualification. Master's degrees vary in type and length. In professional fields these degrees may provide work-related instruction and have no research component; in other fields students may be permitted to pursue a \"thesis opt'on\" (researching and defending a thesis) or a \"non-thesis option\" (no thesis, but some research ability may be demonstrated through papers or projects). Length of program depends upon the level of student preparation, the field, and the regulations of the institution and faculty department. A growing number of universities and academic disciplines no longer require that a master's degree be earned prior to entering a doctoral program. The largest numbers of master's degrees are now earned in business administration and education; the former are nearly always work-related professional programs, while the latter may be either professional programs or research programs. The Post-Master's Certificate. Like postbaccalaureate certificates at ISCED level 6, postmaster's certificates are comparatively rarely awarded. The professional qualification of \"education specialist\" (Ed Sp), which is an advanced non-research credential offered in some teaching and administrative specialties in education, is reported under the this category even though it is not, strictly speaking, a certificate. The few CIP codes under which significant PMC level data are currently reported are listed below by corresponding ISCED code.

ISCED also combines forestry (which it defines to include wildlife management) and fishing programs with agriculture under this broad field, while U.S. classification practice separates them. U.S. undergraduate degree programs in these fields prepare students for employment, independent farm and agribusiness operations, and further study. 66201. General Programmes in Agriculture. This program group code as defined in ISCED corresponds to data reported on U.S. bachelor's degree general programs in agricultural sciences and business operations. Only programs corresponding to the ISCED definition of home economics, and for which data are reported at this level, are included below. (See broad field 566 for an explanation of U.S. reporting practices in this field.) U.S. undergraduate home economics programs prepare students for employment in a variety of occupations including both traditional home economics-related fields and others such as family counseling, consulting, and positions in the food and housing industries. These programs also prepare students for further study in home economics or related disciplines. This ISCED broad field should be inserted at level 6 in order to report data consistently for U.S. undergraduate degree programs in certain fields defined in ISCED as transportation and communications. These include bachelor's degree programs preparing students to become merchant marine officers, commercial aviation aircrew officers, and aviation ground managers. Although these programs lead directly to employment, students may and do continue their studies in related fields such as engineering and business administration (depending on their qualifications).\nAny data reported here will be only for informal or noncredit programs in subjects pertaining to activities related to the formal agriculture programs listed under broad fields 562, 662 and "}, {"section_title": "Social Work", "text": "The list shows that most PMC level awards are in professional fields. These generally take the form of specialized qualifications, such as the aforementioned education specialist programs, or signify that a certain amount of work beyond the master's level has been completed. This additional work may qualify an individual in a subspeciality of his or her field or in an adjunct field. Insignificant PMC data are reported in several categories, including area studies, ethnic and cultural studies, foreign languages, health professions, and business. PMC data are not presented elsewhere in chapter 9, but full crosswalk instructions are provided in the appendix. Graduate research degrees prepare students primarily for academic careers and positions as expert staff in firms, organizations, and government. U.S. universities and other postsecondary institutions possess internal regulations governing the process of hiring entrylevel faculty members and advancing them toward tenure. Tenure, where it exists, is roughly equivalent to tivt European university status of habilitated doctor but results in no award of a second doc, ,ate. Neither does it carry the privileges and official recognition that the professoriate is accorded in some European and other systems.

General Programmes.* This program group code needs to be inserted at ISCED level 7 (it appears at levels 5 and 6) in order to report data accurately on U.S. programs at the graduate level which are either: (a) individualized programs of studies designed by a student under faculty supervision and not corresponding to a regular major field; or (b) structured programs encompassing the interdisciplinary study of broad themes or issues, usually fr( n a humanistic or social scientific perspective. The master's degree (MEd, MAT) is increasingly becoming the preferred professional qualification for teachers at the PK-12th grade levels. It is also preferred for administrators at all levels of education, with school principals and postsecondary administrators often also earning education specialist (Ed Sp) or professional doctor's (EdD) degrees. Programs in the nonteaching and nonadministrative subfields of education, those defined as \"education science\" in ISCED, generally result in the award of the master of arts (MA) or science (MS), or the research doctorate (PhD). It should be noted that the use of the terminology for the doctorate in education is inconsistent across U.S. institutions. The terms \"doctor of education\" (EdD) and \"doctor of philosophy\" (PhD) are often used interchangeably for research and practice programs. 71401. General Programmes in Education Science.
