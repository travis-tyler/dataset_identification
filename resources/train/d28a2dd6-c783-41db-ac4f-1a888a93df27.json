From 1992 to 2010, the global sea-level rise rates recorded by satellite altimetry, in concurrence with tide gauges, range from 3.2-3.3mm/yr (1.26-1.30in/yr) (National Research Council, 2012). Sea-level rise experts agree that projections for the next century -2100range from 0.4m-1.2m (1.3-4ft), depending on feedbacks and emissions scenarios (Horton, Rahmstorf, Engelhart, & Kemp, 2014). National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Climate Assessment have set upper limits of sea-level rise at 2m (6.6ft) by 2100 (NCA, 2014;Burkett & Davidson, 2012). Sea-level rise is already affecting coastal communities worldwide in a variety of direct ways: erosion, storm surge, tidal flooding, compromised drainage, and saltwater intrusion (Parkinson, 2009;NCA, 2014). With acceleration projected, there is an urgency to assess risks and prepare for them. Strauss et al. (2011) estimates that over 10% of the population of the contiguous United States (3.7 million) resides in areas within 1m (3.3ft) of high tide. As 1.6 million of these are Florida residents, the State is home to nearly half (42-49%) of the country's vulnerable population. Miami-Dade and Broward Counties are nationally unique in having significantly lower elevation threshold levels beyond which vulnerable populations increase dramatically (Strauss et al., 2011). Several studies have highlighted Southeast Florida as having significant population, property, and land susceptible to current and impending sea-level rise impacts (Bender, 2010;Hanson et al., 2011;Parkinson, 2009;Southeast Florida Regional Climate Compact, 2012;Tebaldi, Strauss, & Zervas, 2012;Titus & Richman, 2001;Titus & Anderson, 2009;Weiss, Overpeck, & Strauss, 2011;Zhang, 2011). Broward County is currently experiencing the effects of sea-level rise, including storm surge, extreme tides, and inland flooding. Estimating future flooding is complicated by local conditions: surface and groundwater flowing east from the Everglades and the engineered landscape of canals and levees (Merritt, 1996;Strauss, Ziemlinski, Weiss, & Overpeck, 2012). While the threat is evident in the research, there is still uncertainty in the range of projections and the severity of the impacts. There is a non-linearity of the local impacts of sea-level rise due to the topography in Broward County. Once the threshold of 1.5m (4.9ft) is reached, land loss escalates rapidly (Zhang, 2011). Therefore, the timeframe in which to implement the best management practices and most effective strategies will be more restricted. Perhaps more appropriate actions would be taken if stakeholders were aware of the true risk across all scenarios. If the general public understood the risk, perhaps they would make different choices and request solutions from local government and businesses. Do residents understand their risk as sea-level rise increases storm surge, property loss, and flooding? With sea-level rise challenges come opportunities. Broward County has risen to the task and is a national leader in implementing innovative plans for climate change and sealevel rise adaptation (Broward County, 2014). Developing and implementing effective adaptation options involves knowledge of where to target resources and how to communicate risk to generate support for these actions. This dissertation contributes to both of these inquiries in meaningful ways that are site-specific to Broward County, but can be generally applied to other parts of the Southeast Florida region. Within this case study for Broward County, the differences between perceived and actual risk were measured with the goal of distinguishing trends in misconceptions. The author aimed to measure perceived and actual risk and to use the results to identify strategies that bridge the gap between information and action. The methodology consisted of a social science constituent for gauging risk perception, as well as a spatial analysis component for delineating actual risk. The methods of the risk perception element were intended to paint a picture of the various concerns and misperceptions related to local sealevel rise vulnerabilities and adaptation options. Surveys were used to collect public opinions and views about sea-level rise, with respect to a specific stakeholder and his/her residence. The independent variables were the geographic locations and demographic characteristics of respondents. The measured perceptions were assessed in relation to these independent characteristics with the goal of detecting any possible trends that connect a type of stakeholder to a general point of view. Meanwhile, respondents' actual vulnerability was determined by geographically locating the possible impacts from sea-level rise for each residential address. Ground elevation, annual average water table elevation, mean high water elevation (for residences seaward of flood control structures), and depth of inundation from maximum storm surge were the physical variables considered in the risk assessment. Chapter 1 is an introduction to provide a brief background of the study area and a primer on sea-level rise. Chapter 2 presents a literature review of topics related to the overall dissertation. A main overarching theme is highlighting sea-level rise and risk perception research. Chapter 3 of the dissertation describes the current state of sea-level rise risk perception and how issues with inundation mapping can influence perceived risk. Index mapping can be an effective alternative for communicating risk. Methods include the formation of a composite vulnerability index for impacts of sea-level rise in Broward County, Florida. Both socioeconomic risk as well as physical risk were accounted for as overall relative risk was measured for each census block group in the county. Results are discussed in the context of targeting resources towards \"hotspot\" communities that are in most need of adaptation measures. Chapter 4 compares perceived risk versus actual risk to sea-level rise in Broward County, Florida. Perceived risk was measured via online surveys (n=487) and actual risk via best available data on storm surge, flooding, and inundation. The survey answers analyzed were 1) the ordinal results representing respondents' interpretation of relative risk, as well as 2) interval responses for estimates of elevation and depth to water table. Interval survey data for these estimates of geocoded respondents were directly compared against the actual measurements. The ordinal data for actual risk were indexed for comparison to relative risk. A model was required to predict actual risk to future storm surge. A GIS model was created which elevated surge heights from a category 5 hurricane occurring in a 2060 sea-level rise scenario (2ft of sea-level rise). The model compared surge height to land elevation to estimate the storm surge inundation. Results associate individual respondents' risk estimates to the true risk to identify trends in risk bias. These results may be significant in directing the sites for sea-level rise outreach and education. Chapter 5 concentrates on identifying spatial trends for misalignment of perceived risk and actual risk and associating these trends with the background information collected in the online surveys. Socio-demographic data that were found statistically significant using the t-test and chi-square tests were correlated to population characteristics based on independent variables including gender, age, income, and education. These results identify specific groupings of residents where risk bias may leave residents unprepared for sealevel rise impacts. This information can be used to target sea-level rise outreach and education most effectively towards individual residents. Chapter 6 investigates the relationship between awareness, concern, and understanding. What were the main concerns of survey respondents? How can these concerns be addressed when communicating climate change/sea-level rise risk? How can the recommendations in the literature be tailored to Broward County? Survey responses that measured awareness, concern, and understanding were compared along open-ended survey answers. Results from the qualitative content analysis of responses indicated which experience individuals were struck by and what their predominant concerns were."}, {"section_title": "Objectives", "text": "Broward County, a low-lying, highly developed area in Southeast Florida, is the focus of this study. Southeast Florida is vulnerable to sea-level rise because of its topography, dense coastal populations, porous limestone, and highly valued natural and built environment. Previous studies have quantified economic risks, such as property loss, that will result from permanent inundation (Bosello, Roson, & Tol, 2007;Hanemann, 2008;J. Neumann, Hudgens, Herter, & Martinich, 2011;Stanton & Ackerman, 2007;Yohe, Neumann, & Ameden, 1995;Zhang, Dittmar, Ross, & Bergh, 2011). Miami was ranked globally as the port city with the highest future exposure to climate extreme, with an estimate of $3.5 trillion in losses (Hanson et al., 2011). While monetary considerations are a key aspect of sea-level rise vulnerability, finances do not encompass the full spectrum of exposure. When considering an adaptation option, if the benefits outweigh the costs, stakeholders may have an emotional reason or a personal belief that causes a different choice (Yohe, Neumann, & Ameden, 1995). However, little is understood about perceived risk to sea-level rise, and thus there is immense uncertainty in how society might respond to this increasing risk. How can limited resources be targeted to make the most difference in terms of helping residents at highest physical and socioeconomic risk understand and prepare for sea-level rise? Of these highrisk populations, who is underestimating risk most severely and how can risk be communicated effectively to them? In terms of climate change impacts, effective communication is lagging behind scientific knowledge (Moser, 2010a). This study aims to address this knowledge gap by comparing modeled risk with perceived risk. Results identify possible strategies for moving Broward County forward from planning and information to implementation actions. The study objectives meet the need for more societally relevant research on vulnerability and adaptation to climate change (Wolf & Moser, 2011). The objectives of this study are to (1) determine the spatial variability of risk to sealevel rise based on physical and socioeconomic risk (2) characterize perceived risk to sealevel rise and related concerns via surveys (3) identify actual risk to sea-level rise spatially 4) compare perceived risk to actual risk in order to characterize the accuracy of Broward County residents' risk perception and finally to (5) identify reasons for residents' concerns or lack of concern. The overall objective is to describe the state of public perceptions on sea level rise in Broward County in order to inform outreach. These objectives meet the need to understand ways in which sea-level rise risk communication can be ramped up and improved. Effective communication and education can help to remove barriers to adaptation. The results support a call to action towards resilience and preparedness. It is important to note that this is a 4-paper dissertation, in which chapters 3 through 6 are individual papers. Chapter 3 describes a spatial analysis to identify areas in Broward County towards which resources for sea-level rise adaptation would be most effectively targeted. What is the relative risk in terms of areas that have the highest physical risk, but also where residents lack the ability to respond to risk? Is there a disproportionate impact of sea-level rise on low-income communities? Chapter 4 describes how concerned Broward County residents are about each impact of sea-level rise. Does the perceived risk parallel the actual risk that has been measured at the street level? Chapter 5 identifies spatial trends for underestimation and overestimation of each risk. Which types of individuals are underestimating their risk most dramatically, and where in Broward County do these individuals live? What kinds of recommendations can be applied to help these vulnerable areas in terms outreach and adaptation actions? Chapter 6 illustrates a qualitative content analysis for open-response answers in reference to residents' specific concerns. What are the predominant concerns of Broward County residents for future sea-level rise and how does this relate to risk bias, understanding, and awareness? Which outreach messages would address these concerns and most effectively communicate risk?"}, {"section_title": "Review of Sea-Level Rise", "text": "In this section, sea-level rise background that is relevant to this study is presented. Sea-level rise is linked to a vast network of global and local systems and processes: hydrologic, atmospheric, geomorphic, and anthropogenic. It is a complex and multifaceted issue that must be examined on many levels and timescales. The causes of sea-level rise are distinguished at two levels: global, or eustatic, influences and local factors. Over Earth's history, sea-level has changed dramatically due to natural processes, but since industrial times, sea-level rise is attributed to human-induced influences. \"Sea-Level Rise for the Coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington: Past, Present, and Future\" discusses an overview of sea-level rise, how it is measured, what factors contribute to it, and the local variability (NRC, 2012). The report looks at how coastal environment restoration can protect the shoreline from future inundation and waves. Increases in sea-level already trigger flooding, inundation, coastal erosion, wetland loss, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater aquifers. These problems are exacerbated by human development, as South Florida's engineered topography and water flow cause habitat loss and disturb natural processes. All of these issues and their linkages must be considered when planning for the future. It is crucial to understand shoreline change mechanisms, as sea-level rise has huge implications for coastal planning, land-use, and development in areas that are already vulnerable to flooding and storms. Eustatic pressures that cause sea-level rise are thermal expansion, a steric impact, and the cryospheric impact of ice melt; both are driven by increased air and ocean temperatures (NRC, 2012). Timescales influencing sea-level range from hours (e.g., tides) to decades (e.g., astronomic cycles) to millions of years (e.g., tectonics). Sea-level rise is coupled to global climate as well as local anthropogenic and geologic processes. The cryospheric contribution and the thermosteric expansion of the oceans are the main two contributors to global (eustatic) sea-level rise. Local rates of rise can be intensified or reduced based on geological processes and human activity in a specific area. Human development has led to groundwater extraction and in some cases artificial groundwater recharge and storage, which is a local impact that accrues to a global influence on sealevel. The pumping of groundwater may reduce groundwater storage volume, and much of this water will eventually end up in the ocean (NRC, 2012). Increasing water storage has the opposite effect; however, studies show that groundwater depletion in recent decades has contributed to the global sea-level budget (Wada et al., 2012). Other local impacts take the form of vertical land movement caused by isostatic adjustment, or post-glacial rebound, subsidence, and tectonic processes such as uplift. Dynamics of a warming ocean translate into local variation in sea-level due to changing ocean circulation, changing ocean currents, changing ocean influence on atmosphere and rainfall. Global climate is affected by human contributions to greenhouse gas emissions, but also natural processes, including cyclic drivers and patterns. Global sea-level variations also occur due to changes in ocean circulation on seasonal to multi-decadal timescales (Titus & Anderson, 2009). This is due to redistributing mass, increased temperature and decreased salinity in the upper ocean. Seasonal timescales (e.g. El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation ENSO) and decadal and longer timescales (e.g. Pacific Decadal Oscillation PDO) influence ocean currents. There are also orbital forcings involved including precession, obliquity, and eccentricity, described in part by Milankovitch cycles. Global sea-level is measured by proxy measurements, tide gauges, and satellite altimetry (Parris et al., 2012). Proxy measurements are natural archives that record changes in sea-level. They include salt-marsh sediments, micro-atolls, and archaeological indicators. These measurements can capture past 2000 years of sea-level, and so they are useful for indicating robust sea-level rise rates at the sub-meters scale (NRC, 2012) Tide gauges measure the height of the water relative to a monitored geodetic benchmark on land. There are now 2000 tide gauges located around the Earth, and the Global Sea-level Observing System operates 290 of them (NRC, 2012). Tide gauges, popular since 1850, allow averages to be taken over long time periods to remove tide effect. Extrapolating timing and location to attain global sea-level requires spatial and periodic averaging and comparison (Melilo et al., 2014). This is required to avoid local bias. The benefit of tide gauges is that, although there are wide daily and monthly variations, the averages are a direct and unarguable way to measure and quantify sea-level (NOAA, 2012). Satellite altimetry experiments are relatively new, as they began in 2002 with the projects, TOPEX and Jason-1, -2, and the more recent Geosat, Geosat Follow-on, ERS, and Envisat: all satellites equipped with radar altimeters (NRC, 2012). These enable remote measurement of the sea-surface height with respect to the Earth's center of mass by timing the travel time of a radar signal. The calculation of sea-level involves removal of the largescale deformation of the ocean basins caused by glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) (NRC, 2012)."}, {"section_title": "Saltwater Intrusion", "text": "Sea-level rise causes saltwater intrusion, which is a direct threat coastal potable well fields. Additionally, reduced aquifer storage may lessen the capacity by which soil can absorb precipitation and floodwaters, and thus it increases the risk of groundwater flooding. Losing that depth lowers the ability of the aquifer to maintain its storage capacity. Because the water table in a coastal area is just above sea-level, storm surge and extreme high tides can pose some influences as well. Figure 1.1 illustrates the saltwater/freshwater interface at a static condition and the water table elevation in reference to sea level.  Barlow, 2003) The underlying mechanism here is hydrostatic pressure, the pressure of a fluid exerted by gravity, which increases with depth. As freshwater is pumped from the aquifer to supply local needs, the water  (Langevin & Zygnerski, 2013). Coastal well fields in Broward County's Hallandale Beach have been moved inland, and it is estimated that as much as 50% of Broward County's coastal well field capacity is considered to be vulnerable (Jacobs, 2014). Using alternate sources for water is a costly task, estimated at $300 million just for Broward County (Jacobs, 2014). It is a complex and uncertain task to predict the ways in which sea-level rise will affect saltwater intrusion (Langevin & Zygnerski, 2013). It requires estimations of multiple factors, including hydrostratigraphy, aquifer properties, and climatic factors that influence the magnitude and timing of recharge and evapotranspiration. It also requires modeling of mechanisms related to the storage and flow of groundwater and surface water, as well as the differences in elevation between the water table surface and the sea-level."}, {"section_title": "Flow and Storage Influences", "text": "Water table elevation depends on factors that affect flow and storage, and these factors are influenced by human management as well as natural processes. The interactions between groundwater and surface water, as well as contributions from precipitation and evapotranspiration, have a cumulative effect. These levels of inflow and outflow can be quantified in a water mass balance equation. Water table elevation is also influenced by topography, in that higher elevations tend to have a higher depth to water table than adjacent land with lower elevation Factors affecting the flow and storage of the surficial aquifer system include stratigraphy, permeability, effective porosity, water quality, and water table altitude (Merritt, 1997). These hydrologic conditions are all interconnected, and any changes will ripple down to directly and indirectly affect the water table elevation. In South Florida's Biscayne Aquifer, the stratigraphy varies greatly, with distinct changes moving from west to east (Merritt, 1997). Salinity (dissolved solids) affects flow via density. Hydraulic conductivity is important in computing groundwater flow. The permeability combines with fluid properties to equal the hydraulic conductivity, which considered over the vertical thickness of the aquifer equals transmissivity (Merritt, 1997). Porosity is another crucial factor, and it is considered at many levels. The effective porosity is the volume of interconnected pore space (void) divided by total volume. Total porosity is the total volume of pore space divided by the total volume (Domenico & Schwartz, 1998). Primary porosity or interstitial porosity is the volume of voids formed during rock formation. Primary porosity tends to be more evenly distributed because it has existed since the rocks formed and is therefore consistent among well-sorted rocks and sand (Merritt, 1997). Secondary porosity, occurs due to subsequent events such as fractures or solution openings, which are very important in the Biscayne Aquifer (Barlow, 2003). The relative amount of flow through the pores of carbonate rocks is negligible compared to that within solution features. Effective porosity can be estimated directly by analysis of cores or indirectly by comparing precipitation with water level changes (Merritt, 1997). All of these natural influences, along with development and management, pose many challenges in modeling the mass balance effect on water table elevation. Water management practices via levees and well fields also affect average water table altitude and canal aquifer interconnection. The water management plan for South Florida was initially implemented with the goals of mitigating the effects of prolonged dry periods on the water table elevation, and the facilitation of the removal of floodwaters of the scale of those caused by Hurricane Donna in 1960 (Merritt, 1997). This focus on flood protection and water conservation has continued to be tradeoff."}, {"section_title": "Groundwater and Surface Water Interactions", "text": "Another influence to groundwater hydraulic conditions is the natural surface water flow system; this includes overland sheet flow, small episodic springs, and seasonally inundated wetlands. The degree of inundation for these depends on the intensity and duration of seasonal precipitation. The degree of natural groundwater and surface water interactions must be considered when designing groundwater flow models. A qualitative assessment could be made by comparing changes in surface water stages and water table altitudes; modeling what happens when stress is applied to one system or the other. In Merritt (1997), these stresses include vertical fluxes and lateral fluxes. If surface water and groundwater bodies are disconnected, a stress on one would not affect the other. This is not the case for most of the aquifer system in South Florida due to widespread connectivity in the stratigraphy. Southeast Florida's regional growth has necessitated intensive water management control and engineering projects that began with land reclamation and has since transitioned to focus on flood protection measures (Merritt, 1997 (Najib, Jourde, and Pistre, 2008)."}, {"section_title": "Direct, Indirect, and Independent Influences in Respect to", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Climate Change", "text": "It is difficult to isolate the effects of climate change when there are so many other variables at play, and it requires local downscaling to identify local impacts (Green et al., 2011). The influences described in the above sections can be classified as having direct, indirect, or independent connections to climate change. Table 1.1 clarifies the extent of these human-induced changes, physical characteristics of the local surface and subsurface hydrogeology, and climate-related variables. It also adds a fourth impact, ecological influences. Pollution is identified as an independent influence, but it has the potential to increase indirectly from climate change if sea-level rise elevates the water table above contaminated sites, septic tanks, etc. In addition, when storm water is not given enough time to be filtered through the soil, it may mobilize pollutants (Alley, 2002). "}, {"section_title": "Measuring Human Perception via Surveys", "text": "For this dissertation, survey design was critical for the formation of an instrument capable of effectively measuring sea-level rise risk perception. Reliability and validity are required traits for survey questions. To appropriately and concisely measure the overarching inquiry that a survey is intended to appraise, the design of each question must be honed to achieve that goal. Together the questions must reliable, in that they have consistency in terms of wording, meaning, and response expectations (Fowler, 2002). Each question should aim to mean the same thing to any respondent and should be calibrated to elicit accurate and direct responses (Dillman, 2007). Reliable data collection can be challenging due to limited ways to perform data verification. There are possible issues with a respondent's recall as well as his/her interpretation of the question. Validity is related to the types of measurements that are implied in the questions, and the aspects of this design. This depends on whether the measurement is objective or subjective, and whether the answer options collect nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio data (Fowler, 2002). When designing survey questions, one creates a verbal measurement tool. The effectiveness of the questions increases the value of the answers. Good questions will illicit reliable and valid responses. How much does an answer tell about reality, since it is only some version of the truth? There are issues such as problems with recall and intentional alterations of answers."}, {"section_title": "Types of Survey Measures", "text": "There are four levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio (Fowler, 2002). Nominal data result when responses place a person or event into unordered categories, such as male or female. Yes or no questions will generally collect nominal data (Dillman, 2007). Ordinal data are collected when people or events are classified in order along a single scale that involves a direction scale such as: very good, good, fair, or poor. Interval data are measured in numbers to indicate differences at classified intervals. These measurements, such as Fahrenheit temperature, tend to be very rare in surveys. While nominal and ordinal data are qualitative, and help with subjective and some demographic questions, interval and ratio data are quantitative. Ratio data are useful when the difference between two values is important. These are real numbers that can be multiplied and divided. These four kinds of measures are classified as closed questions. They can be advantageous, particularly because recent data collection and processing can be done so easily on a computer. A closed question has a limited number of responses from which the respondent must choose the one that fits most closely. This hones the responses to more distinct categories, making them easier to compare. This can increase reliability of the answers as well as the reliability of result interpretation (Fowler, 2002). Answers that follow an ordinal continuum, the most popular survey measurement, require a closed format (Dillman, 2007). While respondents may have a different interpretation of what the labels and scales mean, it is reasonable to assume that on average, answers will be rated relative to each other. Agree-Disagree items are a special case that should generally be avoided (Fowler, 2002). Although more information is gained because people are in divided into two distinct groups, it is limiting for those who stand on middle ground. Direct ranking is a better option to avoid this issue. Open-ended questions add a different value by giving the respondents a space to express themselves freely (Dillman, 2007)."}, {"section_title": "Error Propagation to Increase Validity", "text": "Sources of error include lack of knowledge, problems with recall, and pressures of social desirability (Dillman, 2007). The researcher can increase the likelihood that the respondent will know the answers to the survey questions by carefully choosing the respondent, eliminating proxy respondents, and modifying the questions or the objective to reduce error from lack of knowledge. Questions can also be modified to ask about more recent events in order to improve recall. It is observed that the further in the past and the less significant an event, the more likely it will be forgotten. It may also help to include a calendar or design some kind of aid to allow respondents to estimate answers. The last source of error stems from significantly underreported conditions due to their embarrassing or illegal nature (Fowler, 2002). The four main sources of survey error include sampling, coverage, measurement, and nonresponse (Fowler, 2002). Sampling error can be avoided by making sure that enough people answer your survey. Coverage has to do with how the respondents are distributed spatially, and coverage error occurs when only a subset of a population has been sampled from. Measurement error can be reduced by modifying poor question wording to elicit more reliable and valid responses. Nonresponse error occurs when the characteristics of respondents that are likely to return the survey skew the results by over-or underestimating responses that are linked to those characteristics. The types of measurement desired and aspects of the design of questions depend on whether the data being measured are objective or subjective. Objective measurements are designed to measure facts or actual events, which can be verified somehow in most cases (Fowler, 2002). For example, asking about payment of income taxes can be confirmed with a tax return. Subjective questions are designed to measure perception, which is only truly understood by the respondent. Assessment of views, including attitudes, opinions, and feelings, have no direct way for verification. Subjective opinions are removed from reality in that they are based on interpretation, and therefore heavily clouded by experience and bias. However, these opinions do affect our world, because they influence behaviors. Pretesting is a good way to reduce errors. It is very important to make sure that one's survey has undergone thorough scrutiny before it is distributed. This can be achieved by submitting the survey to be reviewed by colleagues, by evaluating the cognitive and motivational qualities of the survey, and by administering a pilot study."}, {"section_title": "Design Criteria", "text": "The criteria for design of an effective survey include four things: it must be easy to read, be respondent friendly, reduce nonresponse, and keep wording and appearance simple (Dillman, 2007). A very crucial part of the survey is the first question. This is what makes the first impression on the respondent. There are many requirements for making sure that you have the interest and attention of the respondent right away. The first question must apply to everyone, it must be easy to answer, and it also must be interesting (Dillman, 2007). A carefully chosen first question should relate to respondents in a way that makes them feel connected. One of the biggest issues in surveys is nonresponse, both for the survey as a whole as well as for certain questions within the survey (Dillman, 2007). The latter issue can be alleviated by achieving effective layout and design. To avoid questions being misread or skipped, good choices need to be made about visual aspects (Dillman, 2007). This includes format, font, question order, layout, spacing, brightness, page appearance, paper size, and binding (Dillman, 2007). The questions must encourage the respondent to finish. The criteria for reducing non-response of the entire survey focus on social exchange elements including rewards, cost, and trust (Dillman, 2007). First, rewards help respondents feel they are making a difference by making the survey appear important and interesting. Secondly, cost is generally looked at in terms of time. You can save time by making the survey easy to comprehend and complete. In terms of time, the advantage of the survey is that respondents can go at their own speed. The disadvantage is that when people are not forced to take the time to consider each question, they may hurry and not read the entire content. The last social exchange element, trust, is gained through details that make the survey look important. Designing a tailored survey has requirements on many levels. These include making sure there is a proper physical format, layout design, and ordering of questions. In terms of an appropriate physical format, the best option is to have a booklet or print onesided (stapled in the upper left) (Dillman, 2007). When ordering the questions, the survey should flow like a conversation in a logical order. Questions should be grouped by topic or based on the scale of response. For example, it might be better to cluster ordinal and nominal response questions together, even if the topics vary slightly (Dillman, 2007). Questions should be ordered in a way that begins with the most salient ones that get right to the crux of the topic. The less interesting and more objectionable questions (like income) should be held off until the end of the survey. There is an exception for basic demographic information when it is of importance. Layout and design are very important, because the way that people see and process a survey contributes to their understanding and therefore the effectiveness of measurement.

The region is unique in its geology, history, and diverse, dense mixed income populations.   (Sandoval, 2013). The plan must consider climate change impacts; the Everglades will be strongly affected by sea-level rise (Landers, 2014).     (Merritt, 1997). These included the dredging of an extensive 1800 miles of canals in the county, which are now managed by 28 water utilities (25 providers), 23 drainage/water control districts, 32 Primary Canal Structures, and 57 Secondary Canal Structures (Zygnerski, (2013). Historically, the progression of water management can be divided into periods of major change. These periods include earlier land reclamation and later flood protection. The first proposals for arterial canals to drain waters from the Everglades into the Gulf of Mexico were proposed in the late 1840s (Merritt, 1997). The rest of the century was a progression of land acquisition of the wetlands, mostly by railroad companies. Little reclamation actually occurred until the early 1900s, when the trustees of the internal improvement fund reclaimed title to the wetlands (Merritt, 1997 1920 -1929 4057 1930 -1939 4127 1940 -1949 9225 1950 -1959 30696 1960 -1969 34386 1970 -1979 48139 1980 -1989 58725 1990 -1999  perceived versus actual risk to sea-level rise."}, {"section_title": "Sea-Level Rise", "text": "The rate of sea-level change greatly influences the response of the shoreline.

Barrier islands were not covered, because they migrated towards the shore as the shoreline receded (Dominguez & Wanless, 1991). These barrier islands began to accumulate sand and widen. As current sea-level rise once again begins to accelerate, the migration pattern speeds up. Southeast Florida has a unique vulnerability to sea-level rise in that it is low-lying, it is subject to storms and hurricanes, and the permeable limestone substrate makes the land susceptible to groundwater flooding. The region has already documented sea-level rise impacts including \"king tide\" flooding, failing drainage, malfunctioning canals, and beach erosion (Nelson, 2014). All of these impacts are exacerbated when storm surge builds on top of an increasingly elevated sea-level."}, {"section_title": "Sea-Level Rise Causes", "text": "Modeling the sea-level budget shows a shift in contributions from thermal expansion to melting land ice. Land ice accounted for about 65% of the total sea-level rise budget from 1993 to 2008 (Church & White, 2011). Since 2006, the ice loss rate from the Greenland Ice Sheet has shifted from negative to positive, meaning that instead of lowering sea-level by accumulating ice, it is now raising sea-level (NRC, 2012). Thermal expansion occurs via a steric mechanism by which volume changes with temperature, pressure, and salinity. The thermosteric changes are much more significant than the halosteric ones because ocean mixing significantly decreases the contribution of halosteric expansion to about 1% of the global sea-level rise budget (NRC, 2012). The 2007 IPCC report was found to have a bias that significantly raised rates of thermal expansion for 1993-2003 data sets (Church & White, 2011). With this correction and the rapid increase in melting of glaciers, ice caps, and ice sheets, land ice is currently the largest contributor to global sea-level rise equal to or exceeding contribution of thermal expansion (Rignot & Thomas, 2002). There are 65m (213ft) of equivalent sea-level stored in glaciers, ice caps, and ice sheets: 7m (23ft) in Greenland and 57m (187ft) in Antarctica (NRC, 2012). Cryospheric contributions occur due to melting and runoff (ablation), sublimation, and iceberg calving at the marine margin (Church & White, 2011). Calving has been dominant mechanism of mass loss (Cazenave & Nerem, 2004). There is a theory that all of the feedback mechanisms involved in ice melt can lead to rapid dynamic change, causing rapid sea-level rise. Threshold studies examine these scenarios and predict that they require around four times the preindustrial carbon dioxide (Ridley, Gregory, Huybrechts, & Lowe, 2010) or 5\u00b0C ocean warming (Pollard & DeConto, 2009). Groundwater extraction leads to increased volumes of water ending up in the oceans. The influences of groundwater withdrawal and reservoir storage to the sea-level are largely uncertain due to sparse data and inadequate models (Cazenave & Nerem, 2004). Terrestrial water storage, including reservoir impoundment and groundwater depletion, were previously thought to balance each other out, but a more recent study, Wada et al. (2012) found a net positive contribution of terrestrial water extraction and storage to global sea-level rise of 0.25 \u00b1 0.09mm/yr (0.01 \u00b1 0.0004in/yr)."}, {"section_title": "Sea-Level Rise Rates: Historic, Current and Future", "text": "The recent rates of eustatic sea-level rise averages 30cm per century (National Research Council, 2012). There is much uncertainty with taking past sea-level records and attempting to make projections for the future. Sea-level has fluctuated extremely throughout Earth's geologic history, within a range of hundreds of meters. The rate of sealevel change has varied greatly as well. Since the last glacial maximum, sea-level rise has been shown to occur in two pulses, one 3,200 years ago and another 4,500 years ago (Dominguez, and Wanless, 1991). During these rapid sea-level rise pulses, sea-level rose several feet in a few centuries was followed by standstills of stabilization. During a pulse, sandy barrier islands may not be able to migrate landward fast enough, and they will possibly be overridden and abandoned. During the last interglacial period (~116,000-130,000 years ago), sea-level was 6m higher than the current level (Dominguez & Wanless, 1991). Since the last glacial maximum (LGM), 26,000 years ago, sea-level was 125-135m (410-443ft) lower than the current level. From the LGM to about 7,000 years ago, the rate of sea-level rise was estimated to be 10-20mm/yr (0.39-0.79in/yr) (Parkinson, 2009). The rate then reduced to very stable levels. The recent past (2000 years) has had extremely low rates of sea-level change, on the order of .1mm/yr (0.004in/yr) (NRC, 2012). Yet this global rate has started to creep up again in the past few centuries, going from about 1.8 mm/yr earlier in the 1900s to the current rate of 3.2-3.3mm/yr (0.125-0.130in/yr) since 1992 (NRC, 2012). In recent decades, traditional methods of measuring sea-level rise have been supplemented by satellite altimetry. These measurements concur with tide gauges (Cazenave & Nerem, 2004). The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission, measuring Earth's gravity field and its variability over time, has great potential for helping to estimate changes in sea-level if current difficulties with it are overcome. GRACE's total error budget (due to errors such as glacial isostatic adjustment) suggests a significant uncertainty of ~0.4-0.5 mm/yr (~0.016-0.020 in/yr) (NRC, 2012). Regional variability of global sea-levels reflect inter-annual to inter-decadal variability resulting from the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation, the North Atlantic Oscillation, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and other climate patterns (Bindoff et al., 2007). Current sea-level rise rates have induced shoreline retreat that allows for barrier island migration. An increase in the rate of sea-level rise, however, will lead to submergence and overstep (Parkinson, 2009). While different approaches project a less dramatic increase in sea-level, all agree that the magnitude in rise will be positive with a continuously increasing rate (Church & White, 2011;Horton et al., 2014;IPCC, 2013;Jevrejeva, Moore, & Grinsted, 2010;Rahmstorf, 2007). Rahmstorf's (2007) projections for future sea-level rise, based on semi-empirical methods, range from 90-150cm (3.0-4.9ft) by 2100. For the National Research Council committee, the projections chosen were similar to Vermeer and Rahmstorf (2009) but had a wider range due to integrating a combination of modeling approaches. They project 8-23cm (3.1-9.1in) by 2030, 18-48cm (7.1-18.9in) by 2050, and 50-140cm (19.7-55.1in) by 2100. "}, {"section_title": "Quantifying Uncertainty: Projections and Inundation", "text": "Uncertainty in projecting climate-related sea-level change arises from model uncertainty, scenario uncertainty, and internal variability of the climate system, fluctuating at spatial and temporal levels (Hawkins and Sutton, 2009). Uncertainty can be classified as quantified uncertainty, namely the statistical product of curve fitting, and unquantified uncertainty, based on the assumption that past records can predict future system behavior. There are also many unknowns about timescales for outlet glacier draining. Another uncertainty lies in rare extreme events, ranging from temporary (e.g. storms) to permanent NOAA, 2012 (e.g. earthquakes). Theories such as rapid dynamic response causing sea-level rise pulses are unquantified uncertainty (Dominguez & Wanless, 1991). Methods of projecting sea-level rise include modeling ocean atmosphere-climate system to produce global climate models (GCMs), extrapolating future ice melt, and semiempirical methods. The IPCC used the GCM method by connecting the response of physical processes to sea-level rise and greenhouse gas emissions (Solomon et al., 2007). This caused them to widely underestimate the land ice contribution to sea-level. Semiempirical methods, used by Vermeer and Rahmstorf (2009) examine past glaciological processes to project to the future to reach the higher projections stated in Section 2.1.2. The National Research Council (2012) suggests that increases of 3-4 times the current rate of sea-level rise would be required to reach scenarios of 1m sea-level rise by 2100. Although the acceleration to these levels has not been detected yet, it is very real and plausible. This is due to the critical thresholds being reached and the possibility for rapid dynamic change in cryospheric contributions causing rapid pulses in sea-level (Dominguez & Wanless, 1991). Most sea-level rise projections have based acceleration scenarios on a quadratic curve, and acceleration will amplify local non-linear thresholds (Zhang, 2011)."}, {"section_title": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Coastal Services", "text": "Center describes a widely accepted method for mapping inundation uncertainty. Their 2010 publication describes calculation methods and the associated assumptions made. It describes known data errors (from elevation and tidal surfaces), their effect on mapping results, and how to account for this uncertainty. The important distinctions that are made are that all areas of derived results are not equal in confidence, and uncertainty varies with the inundation depth. Other non-elevation factors such as tidal surface and slope are involved in uncertainty. For example, proximity of the inundation level to the elevation topography increases uncertainty. These factors can be best incorporated into the uncertainty by accounting for known data errors in the mapping results. Table 2.1 shows the known errors associated with elevation and water surface data and their effects on the mapping results. Change states that at this juncture, there has been no attempt to rank, order, or prioritize policy options in terms of expected costs or effectiveness of attempts to draft an adaptation framework that identifies policy domains such as comprehensive land use planning and building regulation, water resource management, transportation, conservation, and beach management (Murley et al.,, 2008). Developing effective policy requires approaches to be disciplined, comprehensive, purposeful, strategic, and efficient. Sea-level rise impacts that are currently being experienced in Southeast Florida include tidal flooding, erosion, and a higher storm surge that moves farther inland. In April of 2014, U.S. Senator Bill Nelson conducted a rare field hearing in which he described Miami as \"Ground Zero\" to feeling the impacts of sea-level rise (Nelson, 2014;Staletovich, 2014). As Zhang (2011) found in Southeast Florida, topography has a huge impact on the effect of each equal increment of sea-level rise. The relationship between sea-level rise and land loss, population displaced, and property value inundated is non-linear. This means that the effects of sea-level rise will be slow at first, but then take off dramatically at local thresholds. For the three counties in Zhang's study area, Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties, there was a critical threshold beyond which losses increased tremendously. These threshold elevations, beyond which inundation accelerates rapidly, were identified at 1.25m (4.1ft) for Miami-Dade, 1.5m (4.9ft) for Broward, and 3m (9.8ft) for Palm Beach. The threshold positions for inundated land, population, and property were analyzed through hypsometric curves that resulted in an S-shape for low, middle, and high elevation zones. Inundation effects with sea-level rise scenarios in relation to the percent of land, population, and property inundated would occur slowly until the threshold was reached, then quickly speed up and gain momentum, and then slow down again. These alarming results lead to the realization that the lack of concern that has been displayed might continue, as decision-makers and stakeholders are under the false impression that there is currently no evident problem. Once the threshold has been reached and rapid inundation is in effect, it will be too late to consider policies and planning that require larger timescales. Effective policies that reduce the enormous risk that sea-level rise places on South Florida must be designed to consider social, economic and ecological impacts in a way that quantifies timescales and vulnerability to inundation and the coupled erosion, saltwater intrusion, and increased storm surge flooding. Zhang (2011) has multifaceted objectives that explore reliability of data sources and project the best available data to explore various sea-level rise scenario impacts on land area, property, and population. He aims to investigate the influence of the horizontal and vertical resolutions of DEMs on inundation analysis. He then uses GIS to estimate land areas inundated from sea-level rise and the effect that topography and acceleration will have in the study area. The non-linear processes of inundation were evident in Zhang's results, which showed that at 0.5m (1.6ft), sea-level rise was mainly inundating the wetlands in Miami-Dade. Sea-level rise would allow saltwater from the Gulf of Mexico to inundate large areas of Everglades and low elevation parts of coastal mainland and barrier islands, but less than 0.6% of Miami-Dade's population and property. Zhang postulates that inland areas could be protected by preventing the saltwater flow into the canals. However, this does not stop saltwater intrusion to the freshwater aquifer. Also, many of the \"barriers\" from the coast are thin separators such as highways that might not protect from storm surge flooding, particularly if heavy rains are already elevating the water table and decreasing the storage capacity of the aquifer. Zhang's results show that at 1m sea-level rise, there is not a dramatic and direct inundation of a large amount of population and property. However, there would be much more vulnerability during temporary storm surge flooding, during which the habitability at low-lying inland areas would be a huge risk. Calamitous inundation is documented for Miami-Dade County at 1.5m of sea-level rise (58% land, 14% population, and 20% property value at inundated areas). This would transform some parts of the southern Atlantic Coastal Ridge into a chain of islands similar to the Florida Keys. Zhang postulates that Miami-Dade's non-linearity threshold will be reached at 1.25m, and Broward County will be at 1.5m of sea-level rise. Once the sea-level rises 1.5m, land loss accelerates in Broward as 79% of land is between 1.5 to 3m, and there is no topographic high that can block Florida Bay's saltwater from inundating western portions of Miami-Dade County and Broward County."}, {"section_title": "Aquifer Vulnerability in South Florida", "text": "Groundwater resources, in most parts of the world, are an essential part of social, ecological and economic well-being. To ensure resiliency, monitoring and assessment of the mechanisms through which climate affects groundwater are required (Alley, 2001). As climate variability increases, water management practices will have to be adapted in order to maintain stability, both short and long-term (Alley et al., 2002). This means maintaining water levels during the dry season and flood prevention during the wet season. The saltwater intrusion line is the inland extent of groundwater with salinity greater than or equal to 1,000 mg/L (Zygnerski and Langevin, 2008). In Broward County, the line moved inland during the 1970s and 1980s but then retreated during the 1990s (Zygnerski and Langevin, 2008). The magnitude of annual variations in the elevation of the water table in the Biscayne Aquifer fluctuates depending on the time period that is being assessed, as well as the particular well that is being measured. In general, the water table elevation varies by a factor of 5 to 6ft annually (Merritt, 1997). Groundwater recession occurs due to evapotranspiration and drainage, and the level always dips down at the end of the dry season, in the late spring. The wet season, culminating in October, has a trend of yearly maximums (Renken et al., 2005). In addition to climate, the water table responds to large-scale engineering projects, municipal pumping, and water management practices. The key climate change stressors (sea-level rise, increased temperature, and changes in precipitation, tropical storms, and hurricanes) all affect South Florida's water supply, water quality, natural systems, and effectiveness of flood control. Specific adaptation and mitigation strategies for these effects include engineering solutions, water conservation, and environmental restoration. To implement these strategies, it is essential to understand the relationship between groundwater and each climate change stressor. As Merritt (1997) describes, South Florida's sheet flow of water has been severely altered through the building of surface-water impoundments, flood control gates, and levees. Pumping from municipal well fields for water supply and irrigation causes a lowering in the water table elevation. These effects vary spatially depending on well placement, but aquifer material permeability also influences the magnitude of their effect. The hydraulic gradient steepens as permeability decreases. Precipitation comes into play in respect to how much the aquifer recharges, and temperature will guide evapotranspiration rates (Doll, 2009). These factors that influence the elevation of the water table can be classified into three overarching categories: human-induced changes, physical characteristics of the local surface and subsurface hydrogeology, and climate-related variables. These factors are interconnected on different timescales and through various linkages. An exemplary portrayal of this connectivity is seen when analyzing the coastal Biscayne Aquifer in South Florida. The unique situation in this study area adds a new variable to the mix due to sealevel rise and saltwater intrusion that can creep through the porous and permeable limestone substrate (Barlow, 2003). The effects of saltwater intrusion on flow and storage will be influenced by both climate and water management decisions."}, {"section_title": "Risk Perception", "text": "Risk can either be considered as a way to express uncertainty or as a collection of perceptions (Raaijmakers et al. 2008). There is a huge contrast in these definitions in that the former is objective while the latter is subjective. This subjective way of looking at risk means that the probability depends on a meaning that has been assigned by an individual, so there is no globally uniform probability. The problem is that the context of the risk is based on limited and uncertain information. However, these perceptions are what shape an individual's behavior. Therefore, the perception of risk might actually have more influence on reality."}, {"section_title": "Juxtaposition of Perceived and Actual Risk", "text": "Sea-level rise has characteristics of risks that are underestimated (Kraus & Slovic, 1988;Raaijmakers, Krywkow, & van der Veen, 2008;Ryan et al., 2011;Slimak & Dietz, 2006;Starr, 1969). Sea-level rise is gradual, certain/expected, and there is a level of control individuals have, both in terms of resilience and in terms of the extent to which sea-level rise accelerates due to greenhouse gas emissions. These characteristics cause individuals to underestimate their risk. Conversely, individuals overestimate risk to events, such as plane crashes and terrorist attacks, because these risks have opposite characteristics. They are sudden, unexpected, deadly, and uncontrollable. Sea-level rise is also associated with climate change, which has been identified in the research as a reality that certain populations in the U.S. erroneously deny due to political, societal, and psychological influences (Corner, Whitmarsh, & Xenias, (Raaijmakers et al., 2008). Sea-level rise focus groups conducted in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties acknowledged the vulnerability, but did not feel that action was required (Goux & Bolter, 2012). The participants expressed more concern about increased taxes and insurance rates than the threat of sea-level rise. Focus groups from inland zip codes also voiced feelings of safety due to the misconception of sea-level rise impacts being limited to the coast (Goux & Bolter, 2012). The South Florida Regional Planning Council conducted a behavioral study to find that there is a high perceived risk for storm surge flooding and hurricanes (SFRPC, 2012). There was much less concern for groundwater flooding in areas not connected to the ocean."}, {"section_title": "Influences on Perceived Risk", "text": "Slavic 1988 A key early paper on risk perception was Starr (1969), in which the trade-off between social benefits and technological risk were examined to find that people were 1000 times more likely to accept a risk if it was voluntary. For example, the risk of having an accident when you are driving your car is voluntary. Risk perception has since collected many theories that can be classified into psychological, cultural, and interdisciplinary. Risk perception depends on the level of understanding of the risk, the level of dread from the risk, and the number of people exposed. Risk understanding is based on awareness and preparedness (Raajmakers et al., 2008). Risk awareness levels can be divided into expert, underestimated, and ignorant. The ignorance may be due to the fact that too much time has passed since the last time one was at risk (i.e., one tends to forget). Risk preparedness has four dimensions: Technical, social, institutional, and economic (Raajmakers et al., 2008 Risk perception is based on the relationships between worry, awareness, and preparedness (Raajmakers et al., 2008). This stems from the Bayesian way of thinking, based on Thomas Bayes, which argues that subjective probability is the degree of belief in interpreting a problem. Objectivity does not exist in this context of measurement, and therefore no universal and true probability exists (Raaijmakers et al., 2008). The options when examining risk are to accept the risk, reduce it, or avoid it (Sharlin, 1989). The option that one chooses depends on the trade-offs that are associated with the risk. An example of this trade-off is living on the beach. People are so eager to enjoy the benefit of ocean views and ocean access that they are willing to tolerate the risk of coastal hazards. Flood risk perceptions and spatial multi-criteria analysis: An exploratory research for hazard mitigation goes beyond the objective and conventional approach for measuring risk (probability x consequence) and allows a more subjective multi-criteria approach that considers risk perception, and the trade-off between worry and benefits to risk (Raaijmakers et al. 2008). Essential links between worry, preparedness, and awareness are The results of Raaijmakers et al. (2008) reflected a preference for the land-use changes even when stakeholder perceptions were integrated. However, the components of risk perception were largely skewed: awareness and worry were very high compared to preparedness. This is characteristic of the risk reduction typology in which individuals are ill prepared and demand risk reduction. They see exposure to flooding as involuntary, and therefore expect the authorities to take the appropriate actions. These results can make a solid case when influencing policy because it is supported by both subjective and objective data. Decision makers can consider both the quantitative spatial recommendations of experts based on land characteristics, as well as the more intuitive opinions of the residents. Another benefit of this method is that it can translate into more effective risk communication and social learning. When policy makers understand the public perceptions, they can better inform residents in a way that closes gaps, rectifies misconceptions, and moves adaptation forward (Mozumder, Flugman & Randhir, 2012). The next step would be to increase awareness as a means to promote safety, and then preparedness can take communities to the next level, control. Understanding these major information-action gaps between perception of climate change impacts and the need for adaptation are important areas that require more research (Mozumder, Flugman & Randhir, 2012). When communicating risk and measuring risk perception, it is important to use units of measurement that the public relates to. Therefore, from this point on in the dissertation, English units of measurement in feet will be used in partiality rather than meters for indicating distance.  (Helm, 1996). There has yet to be a study at the block group level for Broward County that considers both physical and socioeconomic risk. based on a social vulnerability index. The results showed that a higher social vulnerability increased the likelihood that an area would be abandoned rather than protected. These projections bring about the notion that environmental justice and equity must be framed in adaptation policy."}, {"section_title": "Problematic Issues with Inundation Mapping", "text": "Imagery is an effective method for communicating risk, and mapping is instrumental in adding the spatial element. The most common way to illustrate sea-level rise vulnerability is single-value surface model, or \"bathtub model\" (Frazier, Wood, Yarnal, & Bauer, 2010;Gesch, 2009;Kleinosky, Yarnal, & Fisher, 2007;Li et al., 2009;Rygel, O'Sullivan, & Yarnal, 2006;Shepard et al., 2012;Titus & Richman, 2001;Wu, Yarnal, & Fisher, 2002).. Bathtub models are static maps that assign units of elevation to indicate inundation for an equivalent unit of sea-level rise. They do not consider dynamic changes from human development and natural processes. Anthropogenic activities such as the building of inlets, sea-walls, and beach nourishment are constantly altering the coastline (Gesch, 2009). Natural processes include barrier island migration, changes in sedimentation rates and deposition, wetland accretion, and changes in tidal elevations (Titus & Richman, 2001). The problem with integrating geomorphic processes and the effects of anthropogenic changes into models is that it is extremely complex. Dynamic models such as Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) and Sea-level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) attempt to integrate the effects of storm surge and accretion, but there is even more uncertainty overlaid from these (Mcleod et al., 2010). Other errors for the tidal surface arise from interpolating between tide gauges along the shoreline and then further by extrapolating these values inland (NOAA, 2010). The key error for elevation is the vertical resolution (see section 2.1.3 for more). LiDAR has become widely popular due to its high vertical accuracy, but it is limited by certain land cover and slopes. Zhang (2011)  It is also important to distinguish between \"inundated areas\" based on their connectivity to the coast. Hydrologically connected areas are inherently more vulnerable to storm surge, erosion, and more direct inundation. Zhang (2011) delineates the inundated coastal land area by being directly connected by the water and distinguishes the impacts for each of the areas. While some studies distinguish inland and coastal vulnerabilities this way (Rotzoll & Fletcher, 2013;Zhang, 2011), most methods only use 8-way connectivity to the shoreline that does not account for increased inland flooding as a result of sea-level rise impacts on the water table in coastal aquifers (Frazier, Wood, Yarnal, & Bauer, 2010;Gesch, 2009;Kleinosky, Yarnal, & Fisher, 2007;Li et al., 2009;Rygel, O'Sullivan, & Yarnal, 2006;Shepard et al., 2012;Titus & Richman, 2001;Wu, Yarnal, & Fisher, 2002). The mechanism by which sea-level rise can exacerbate flooding in a coastal, unconfined aquifer is a mechanism of water table rise that reduces the soil's storage capacity and restricts the capacity for drainage."}, {"section_title": "Advantages and Potential Disadvantages of Index Mapping", "text": "Information about climate change risks must be carefully displayed and explained in order to be engaging (A. Leiserowitz, 2006). One way to communicate sea-level rise is to present data in the form of indices that map vulnerability to a variety of physical sealevel rise impacts, such as extreme tides, storm surge, and inland flooding. Other attributes, such as financial or socio-demographic variables, may be folded in as well. CVIs take into account both the probability of an event occurring and the impact of that event. An inundation map says, \"Your home is vulnerable to potential inundation at this increment of sea-level rise,\" while a CVI's message can be presented as, \"Your home is in an area that is at the high end of the risk spectrum when compared to other areas in your county/region.\" trends, such as \"housing density\" and \"percent of population on rural farms\", essentially cancel each other out. Vulnerability of large rural areas can be exaggerated when mapping results. For example, a vast census tract with only 50 people might be ranked as highly vulnerable. On a map, the large size of the tract makes it disproportionately stand out as a hotspot. While less dense population has fewer opportunities in some respects the analysis must consider the applicability of solutions. When adaptation resources are limited by extent of the area, an effective strategy would be to protect the largest number of people within the smallest space, while also making sure that these are the people who need help the most. When population density is mixed in evenly with 30 other variables, the criticality of the issue is obscured. For this reason, indicators were limited to the most fundamental ones."}, {"section_title": "Social Vulnerability Instead of Financial Vulnerability", "text": "Two main perspectives have emerged in terms of the meaning of vulnerability. The first is to look at vulnerability as a pre-existing condition and to focus on the likelihood of general exposure to risk. The next perspective considers the consequence of this exposure based on an individual's lack of resilience. Resilience is defined as the ability to recover from losses quickly. When resilience is considered along with resistance, which is the ability to absorb damaging impact of a hazard, they contribute to overall vulnerability. Traditional vulnerability analyses assess sea-level rise projections and land elevations to estimate the economic impact of various sea-level rise scenarios. Many of these studies focus on cost benefit analyses that are based on financial exposure (Titus et al., 2001;Yohe et al., 1996;Stanton and Ackerman, 2007;Hanneman 2008;Neumann et al., 2010). Local studies have quantified property values at various increments of sea-level rise (Southeast Florida Regional Climate Compact, 2012; Zhang, 2011). Yet, there is a key distinction between financial vulnerability and community resilience. In general, the owner of a highly valued property is more likely to have the means to relocate in the event of a disaster, and is therefore more resilient. Sea-level rise vulnerability analyses must consider consequences in terms of impacts on the community if they are to maintain the scope of environmental justice and equality. However, the argument can be made that highvalued properties support a significant portion of the tax base that supports the community. It is thus important to maintain a balance and consider both approaches. \"The vulnerability of places\" combines two perspectives: looking at biophysical risk as well as social response. These can be quantified in terms of likelihood and consequences. Taking the product of these relates the two into an overall vulnerability index. Social vulnerability increases with lower-income populations, and therefore income is a crucial indicator (Rygel, O'Sullivan, & Yarnal, 2006 Kleinosky, Yarnal, & Fisher (2007). Population density is key in distinguishing how many people will be affected in a particular unit of area. The three indicators were normalized in order to be weighed against each other. The singular vulnerability index (In) for most social indicators is the ratio of the value for each census block (Vn) to the maximum value for all of the study area (Vmax) (eqn. 1). Median household income was the exception, as the relationship towards vulnerability was inverse. High income decreases vulnerability, and therefore the ratio each census block's value to the county's block group maximum value was subtracted from 1 (eqn. 2) (Wu et al., 2002)."}, {"section_title": "1) =", "text": "2) = 1 \u2212 Each of Broward County's 940 block groups was assigned a value between 0 and 1 for each indicator based on its rank in comparison to other block groups in the county. The three ranking values were averaged for each block group to give an overall consequence rating from 0-1. These values were evenly distributed into categories of low, medium, or high in terms of exposure to each risk to create the aggregated social vulnerability index. The LiDAR digital elevation model was provided by the Florida Department of Emergency Management and has 10-ft horizontal resolution and a fundamental vertical accuracy of 0.6ft at 95% confidence level (Appendix A -Data Specifications for LiDAR). The Digital Elevation Model was adjusted by tidal influences seaward of flood control structures by subtracting the mean higher high water (MHHW) from it. According to NOAA, MHHW is the average of the higher high water height of each tidal day observed from tide gauge data over the National Tidal Datum Epoch that ranges from 1983 to 2001. Mean lower low water (MLLW) is the opposite, meaning the average of the lowest of the low tides each day. Figure 3.1 shows that for Virginia Key, Florida, the MHHW is 0.20ft above NAVD88 and the tidal range between MHHW and MLLW is 2.19ft. The way to account for tidal influence in the bathtub model is to use a VDATUM (vdatum.noaa.gov) surface produced by NOAA in 2012. When integrating the tidal surface with the ground elevation this way, there is an inherent error associated because NAVD88 is not a tidal datum. Since the Key West (hourly heights 1983 to 2001) MSL is 1.67 m above NAVD88 datum, and the MHHW height of each tidal day is about 1.94 m, the difference between the MHHW and the NAVD88 along the South Florida coast is about 0.1 m. This means that coastal areas below 0m NAVD88 datum are inundated at least once per day (Zhang, 2011). The physical vulnerability was measured by combining elevation and tidal data in GIS, but first the inland water bodies needed to be subtracted from the DEM. The \"water\" shapefile provided by Broward County (gis.broward.org) was compared against the Google satellite basemap in GIS to verify that this layer accounted for all lakes, canals, reservoirs and other waterways. The waters polygons were used to clip the outline of the county to create a land polygon. Using this new shapefile and the \"extract by mask\" tool, the DEM was reduced to land-only elevations. The resulting DEM raster was clipped along the polyline that runs along the flood control structures, and the VDATUM was subtracted from the eastern clip. After combining the rasters back together with the mosaic tool, the adjusted elevation accounted for tidal influences where appropriate. The zonal statistics tool was used to calculate the average elevation per block group. With the zonal statistics, the output is still a raster and therefore requires further manipulations. The block groups were converted to points and the \"extract value to point\" tool was used to input the elevations. Using a histogram, the block groups were classified into equal increments and clustered into three groups: low, medium, and high. Once each block group had been classified into evenly distributed categories of low, medium, and high for both physical (likelihood) and social (consequence) risk, it was possible to combine the two using these factors in a matrix as shown in For example, a block group needed to be at the highest level of vulnerability in both dimensions to be classified as high-risk in the CVI. Once the five categories had been assigned, the results were mapped and tabulated for a statistical analysis that compared each variable's influence on the results. A quantitative analysis was done for block groups within all three counties in Southeast Florida to compare their vulnerable populations. This involved creating a layer that contained all block groups with average elevations below 5ft and joining it with the census statistics for those selected block groups. The percent of the population that is Hispanic and African American was calculated for those low-lying block groups. The residents with median income below $30,000/yr and with median age over 60 was also quantified. Landuse data, property appraiser data, and SLOSH data for storm surge (see Appendix C for data specifications) were also mapped in order to compare these factors against results."}, {"section_title": "Results and Discussion", "text": "Results from the data preprocessing reveal spatial patterns of socioeconomic dissimilitude as well as extensive ranges for physical risk.\nResults reflect the actual and perceived trends that were measured, and characterize the linkages between them.

Further data inquiry was undertaken to understand these trends. The residential areas and home values were mapped and assessed.   "}, {"section_title": "Physical Risk Indicators", "text": "For the physical risk, inland and coastal areas were treated differently. Inland areas that lacked hydrologic connectivity to the coastline were not disregarded, as these areas may still be vulnerable to groundwater flooding. However, the risk in coastal areas was enhanced with the risk to tidal flooding by accounting for the tidal range.     The storm surge inundation extent follows closely with low-lying areas, and also with the flood control structures. The flood control structure locations follow closely along the saltwater intrusion line. These trends exemplifies the connections between saltwater intrusion, surface water, the water table, ground elevations, and flood control structures. The flood control structures are closed in the dry season, maintaining freshwater levels in the canals upstream. Seaward of the structures, the saltwater comes in via above-ground waterways, but the saltwater intrusion follows from below.   (Figure 3.5). The clusters of high-risk areas correlate more to population density and income than age. This is likely due to the more pronounced clustering of high density and low income along the central north-south corridor of the county in contrast to the scattered block groups with a larger percent of elderly residents.

The high-risk clusters identified from the social vulnerability index were disseminated based on elevation.

There are socioeconomic factors that must be considered, and these cannot be easily identified with the bathtub method."}, {"section_title": "Caveats", "text": "The elevation mapping caveats for this chapter and the following chapters relate to the challenges presented by any bathtub model. Dynamic processes along the shoreline are assumed to be static (Gesch, 2009). According to the LiDAR data shown in Figure 3.1, the beach dunes on most barrier islands along Southeast Florida's coast have the highest elevations, and the land dips down towards the Intracoastal. Initial inundation will be on the land-facing side, but this causes the remaining \"land\" to be a thin strip of beach. With shoreline retreat and erosion, exacerbated by storm surge, it is unlikely that this sandy strip will exist. Along the coastal wetland marsh, accretion might be able to keep pace with sealevel rise, depending on the rate of rise, the rate of sedimentation, and other factors (Smoak et al., 2013).\nThe study design had a huge influence on the results. There are inherent inaccuracies with such subjective issues, such as all of the errors associated with survey sampling, coverage, measurement, and non-response. However, many of these influences are laid out and justified by the authors. Changes in the design to reduce one error likely would lead to some other error or skewed result. These trade-offs are well known in survey There are also limitations to the study with reference to the actual risk data sources. Confidence levels within the elevation data have been discussed in section 2.1.3. The FAVA DTW data layer may also lack precision due to wide variations in the water table elevation and the uncertainty about future precipitation and evapotranspiration patterns. A large assumption was made to generalize the FAVA DTW in the data layer that was used. This study's wide scope limited the comprehensive nature by which each impact could be analyzed. While the vulnerability to groundwater flooding was limited in granularity, the magnitude of the errors in the data layer was considered in respect to the comparison to perceived risk (see error details for FAVA DTW data in Appendix D -Data Specifications for FAVA II Depth to Water Table). Respondent estimates were given a wider range than specified in the data set by which they were considered realistic. The storm surge layer also carries many caveats, as the SLOSH model's maximum of maximum wave heights is an extreme, which was intensified by using the category 5 measurements. This constraint was slightly alleviated as the storm surge data layer was only used for relative risk. In fact, using these extreme values was a necessity for balancing the index with reasonably even categories. When spatially comparing the inundation levels with a category 5 hurricane, the northern half of the study area remained dry. Adding 2 feet of sea-level rise brought the waves higher and further inland to where the relative risk categories became more uniformly distributed in terms of area of coverage for each risk category in the index. The survey question (in which the response was used to measure against the index) asked, \"Compared to the rest of Broward County,\" rather than for a distinct value and unit of measurement. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that these relative risk categories are valid solely for relative comparison.\nThe limitations and assumptions about the data layers for actual risk have been explained in sections 2.1.3 and 3.4. However, it is important to add the spatial issues with mapping risk bias for this chapter. Figure 5.5 illustrates the geocoded points over the 132 residential areas. The clustering for the points over these darker gray areas are distinct from the non-residential areas that lack respondents. In addition, areas in the southwestern portion of the study areas which have low population density also have sparse respondent points. These irregular patterns may have offset the trend analysis. For the FAVA DTW, confidence was calculated using a student t-test (contrast divided by the standard deviation) to be 96.91%. The positive contrast of .436 suggests statistical significance (Baker and Cichon, 2009). Other model implementation and limitation caveats may be found in Appendix D -Data Specifications for FAVA II Depth to Water Table. It would be ideal to have the full range of values for DTW for the wet and dry season over several years. However, for the objective here, to identify areas that are at higher risk to groundwater flooding on the basis of depth to water table, an overall relative vulnerability is sufficient. It is a large assumption that drainage issues, changes in pumping, and diversions through canals will not impact this vulnerability."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion and Recommendations", "text": "The uncertainties discussed for bathtub models may be clarified by stating all of the assumptions and limitation in some kind of disclaimer. Another way is to alter the colors and the display when mapping the results. It is misleading to simply color over \"inundated\" areas with the same blue as the ocean. Alternatively, different colors may be used to indicate the confidence levels of inundation (NOAA, 2012). Another possible display method, used here, is using a color scheme that indicates relative threat levels (green, yellow, and red). Generally, in the literature it is recommended that policy-makers consider best available data to implement a no-regrets policy. Scenario-based risk assessment identifies the adaptation option for which the benefits outweigh the costs for all possible scenarios (Kirshen et al., 2012). In many cases, this robust action is advantageous even in the case of no changes in sea-level (Hallegatte et al., 2011). There are also increasingly efficient possibilities for adaptation in terms of protection, redesign, and relocation. The results presented here can be a tool to promote sea-level rise adaptation actions. Effective adaptation tools include: (1) Land-use regulations that limit development in high-risk areas (2) Limits on insurance subsidies for coastal properties so that rates reflect true risk (3) Redesign and retrofitting of structures to increase their resilience to inundation and storm surge (4) Updates for drainage, flood control, and water supply infrastructure (5) Increased coastal protection through buffers such as living shorelines Many of these tools lead to co-benefits such as improved public health and conservation of natural areas. Robust sea-level rise adaptation options will require significant economic costs -costs that one may not be willing to pay in the case of resignation or underestimated perception of risk. The results of this study can be used to develop a public outreach strategy and to gain support for adaptation actions. The information-action gap may be bridged by effective communication and imagery. A CVI as well as an inundation map can be utilized in order to guide changes to land-use and insurance subsidies as well as to inform policy and planning decisions. Limited funds present challenges in implementing coastal protection and infrastructure improvements, but this CVI can aid in prioritizing areas that have the most need, both physically and socioeconomically. The decisions that planners make today to deal with current challenges in coastal development and protection will impact the future as sea-level rise continues to exacerbate coastal hazards such as storm surge, erosion, and flooding. It is important to consider community resilience when prioritizing the allocation of resources to prevent future increases in economic disparity. Chapter 6 is a study of open-ended survey responses to the request, \"explain your concerns for today?\" One answer states, \"My family is going through a very difficult time financially, and although I know it is short sighted, if a storm or major flooding incident occurred, I don't know how we would be able to survive. We would lose everything.\" This quote exemplifies the fragility of individuals on the disadvantaged side of the socioeconomic rift. From the results of this study, it is clear that the focus for increasing community resilience is most urgent in the southern parts of the county, with a focus on west Fort Lauderdale, southern Pompano Beach, and Hallandale Beach. These areas are at the highest likelihood of risk and the lowest chances of having resources to respond to the risk."}, {"section_title": "COMPARISON OF ACTUAL RISK TO PERCEIVED RISK IN BROWARD COUNTY, FLORIDA", "text": "Much of the investigation and planning for adaptation has been done, but implementation and tangible developments are limited (Parris et al., 2012). Coastal flooding and storm surge inundation are recognized as an urgent and direct threat by emergency managers and planners in South Florida, but does the public understand the risk? The key coastal hazards considered in this study are storm surge, seasonal flooding, and permanent inundation. Is it understood that these risks increase as the sea-level rises? Are more unique local impacts of sea-level rise understood? These distinct impacts relate to the characteristics of the low-lying regional landforms. Southeast Florida has a porous limestone bedrock and an unconfined coastal aquifer, the Biscayne Aquifer. As sea level rises, the inland water table will also rise as the system adjusts to the new conditions. As the water table rises closer to the land surface, low-lying areas are at risk to \"flooding from below\" due to inundation where the water table rises above the land surface and also due to the loss of capacity of the unsaturated zone to store additional water during heavy rains or storm surge. Therefore, in addition to elevation and storm surge zone, it is important to consider depth to the water table (DTW) when assessing vulnerability to increased flood risks. Broward County has densely populated areas at risk to rising sea-level, but the risks are not spatially uniform. To determine whether individual perceived risk is accurate, it can be assessed and verified against best available data. Florida. The region has a unique geographic situation that adds three distinct layers of vulnerability. First, sea-level rise will elevate the foundation upon which storm surge builds. Second, South Florida is a target for hurricanes and associated storm surge based on historical hurricane tracks (Figure 4.1). Lastly, the region has porous limestone bedrock and an unconfined coastal aquifer, the Biscayne Aquifer. With little change in relief, the region is relatively flat and low-lying. The projected sea-level rise for this century will push the shoreline inland dramatically. Only more recent studies consider the relationship between water table elevation and sea level rise, and there is still no consensus on methodology. Rotzoll and Fletcher (2013) modeled the response of the water table to sea-level rise in Honolulu. The results showed a doubling in land loss when inland groundwater pooling from the coastal aquifer was considered. The model was based on a simulation created by Werner and Simmons (Werner & Simmons, 2009), which showed that the impact of sea-level rise on sea water intrusion decreased moving inland. The extent of the impact was greater for flux-controlled systems than for head-controlled systems. Chang et al. (2011) describes an overall \"lifting process\" by which there is a 1:1 ratio in water table elevation that correlated to sea-level rise. Estimating risk of groundwater flooding related specifically to sea level rise is extremely challenging. Water tables vary due to a variety of factors as described above and in sections 1.2 and 2.1.5. In addition, it is an extremely complex issue to predict human induced factors that will affect the water  (Obeysekera et al., 2013). However, non-stationary climate scenarios suggest that changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration will increase vulnerability, in that the impacts may impede water supply and flood control operations (Obeysekera et al., 2011). Methods in the literature for enhancing storm surge heights with sea-level rise are also new, but less diverse. Studies that use SLOSH results linearly add sea-level rise increments to the MOMs before interpolating the resulting grids (Frazier et al., 2010;Kleinosky et al., 2007;Shepard et al., 2012;Wu et al., 2002). In Sarasota County, Florida, the addition of 120cm to current sea-level altered storm-surge hazard zones in such a way that the increase in population and asset exposure was analogous to a shifting up of on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale (Frazier, Wood, and Yarnal, 2010). For example, a category 1 hurricane storm-surge hazard zone augmented by 120cm of sea-level rise resembled the current category 2 zone. The enhanced storm surge risks were applied to the 2050 comprehensive land-use plan, which seeks to limit sprawl by applying an urban service boundary. This boundary limits commercial and residential growth to vulnerable coastal areas and therefore essentially increases risk exposure. The linear addition method of adding sea-level rise to surge height may not be applicable for Southeast Florida. Zhang et al. (2013) found that this method leads to large errors in terms of overestimating inundation for the mainland. With a case study for Hurricane Andrew, the magnitude of wave height was 22-24% higher and the extent of inundation was 16-30% more expansive, when compared to numerical simulations. The reason for the error is that these methods work under the assumption that the storm water moving inland piles up as it pushes against the increasing elevation of the topography. In most areas, this is the case; however, in Southeast Florida, the highest elevations are along the Atlantic Coastal Ridge, with land dipping down as it goes west towards the Everglades. The ridge is cut through by low-lying transverse glades, cut by the historic flow of the Everglades, through which many canals and rivers still run. A moderate storm surge can easily travel west of the Ridge via these transverse glades. Once the storm surge has moved inland of the narrow transverse glades, there is land dissipation effect in which the storm surge spreads out and thus the water height is dramatically lowered (Condon & Sheng, 2012)."}, {"section_title": "Measurement of Perceived Risk", "text": "The earliest sea-level rise risk assessment studies focused on estimating a dollar value for the \"cost of holding back the sea\" by implementing a cost benefit analysis of the optimal response to sea-level rise (Titus et al.,1991, Yohe et al., 1995, 1996. This model is logical, but human response to sea-level rise will not necessarily follow its reasoning. The model will not apply if property owners do not perceive their land to be at risk until it is too late, if there are legal obstacles, or if there is an emotional impulse to pay more than the value of the property to protect it. Another aspect of this is that poverty-stricken communities cannot afford to keep themselves safe regardless of the cost. Actual risk depends on the severity of a particular event and the probability of its occurrence (Kaplan and Garrick, 2006). Perceived risk differs because individual views are skewed by political, cultural, emotional, and timing filters (Leiserowitz, 2006). There is more concern for threats that are immediate and severe rather than those that are gradual and uncertain. The most drastic risk responses result from short-term, costly disasters. The threat from sea-level rise is not seen as urgent because it is slowly creeping up over time. There is a lack of understanding about the mechanisms that cause sea-level rise, and this is coupled with the uncertainty of sea-level rise projections (Harvatt et al., 2011). While the magnitude of change in sea-level among projections has a range that increases with time, the exponential growth is certain. Perceived risk is a personal interpretation of risk that is generally measured with focus groups, interviews, and surveys. The literature review describes a variety of survey distribution methods for measuring perceived risk. Snowballing is a discrete method of recruitment by which respondents are referenced by previous respondents (Rosemarie et al., 2004). Being asked to take a survey by a known contact, whether via a weak or strong tie, dramatically increases the likelihood of response (Denscombe, 1997). The initial circle of contacts should result from a similar group of referrals that lead to \"waves\" that perpetuate to other groups, each with at least one characteristic that is linked to the original core cycle of participants. Snowballing technique requires voluntary actions of respondents not only to take the survey, but to share it with their network. To gather \"champions\" that will successfully accumulate a significant sample size, it is important to have a compelling cause. When these trusted \"champions\" enable access to targeted populations, their referral adds to the legitimacy of the results and reduces skepticism of investment in time spent on taking the survey (Rosemarie et al., 2004). While the disadvantage of the inherent \"targeting\" bias is acknowledged, there can be a benefit to reach certain groups that might otherwise be difficult to locate and reach out to (Lopes et al., 1996). Cascading contacts and referral chains can reduce costs, while maintaining efficiency, particularly if monitoring occurs to ensure that the demographics remain diverse (Patrick et al., 1998). Careful choices must be made as to whether responses are open or closed. Both methods have advantages to maximizing validity and reliability. The key ways to increase reliability are to avoid inadequate wording, to ensure consistent meaning, and to be careful with using the \"don't know\" option. An example of incomplete wording is to simply ask, \"Age?\" It is also important to avoid awkward wording or words that are difficult to pronounce. Fowler (2002) recommends to stay away from asking multiple questions that are clustered into one. This gets tricky in terms of complex issues, in which there is a tradeoff between keeping it simple and clearly defining the terms of the question. The \"don't know\" option is tricky as well because if the respondents do not have the information to answer the question, they might not admit so, and just guess the answer. A screening question could determine familiarity with the topic. Fowler (2002)  during the astronomic tide. The observed water levels at NOAA's Virginia Key station were 1.5ft above the MHHW. Although 2013 was a relatively average year, there were significant events in 2012. The year had above average precipitation after two previous dry years (Zygnerski, 2013). At the end of October, Hurricane Sandy passed by Florida. Although it did not make landfall, strong offshore winds and high energy waves, combined with high tides, pushed ocean water higher and further inland, causing severe flooding and erosion in South Florida (Kaye, 2012). In November of that year, the erosion continued and eventually, 2,000 ft of the coastal state road, A1A, collapsed. The beach, seawall, and sidewalk were washed into the ocean. The $21 million repairs took several months and the new seawall remains at the same original height of 18in (Jacobs, 2014 (Figure 4.2).

The list was advantageous in terms of consistency because it had a similar group of individuals and it terms of spatial distribution because it contained the phone number and email of municipal workers from 29 cities in Broward County. Contacting one individual from each city increased the probability for even distribution around the county. These individuals also were more likely to respond, given that they had responded to a previous survey related to sustainability. The previous response indicates that there is likely to be motivation related to seeing the environment as a compelling cause. This was also likely to be the case because as the title of each employee was supplied, most were related to natural resources and green space. Many employees replied enthusiastically and offered to promote the survey on their respective municipal websites. While this led to a disproportionate volume of respondents by city, other methods were incorporated. As responses came in, the spatial and demographic distribution was monitored. Supplemental groups were targeted to fill in gaps that had been identified. For example, a survey link was sent to groups in a General Educational Development (GED) class to collect respondents at lower levels of education. Cities with low response were targeted more directly. The survey questions are in Appendix E -Online Survey Questions. Measurement instrument used for distributing the survey is available via Google Docs (https://docs.google.com/forms). The Google Docs web survey design software allows for a diverse menu of options for layout, question format, and respond options. It was possible to design a survey that followed the guidelines and design criteria set by Dillman (2007) and Fowler (2002). Consistent measurement requires proper wording, properly defined terms, and distinct answer options. Issues with validity can be addressed through the application of intention to the measurement. An answer is valid only to the extent as to how precisely it answers the question. Increasing validity means making sure that the questions and answer design stimulate an appropriate response that is intended to gauge what is being measured. As the data being compared was either numeric or categorical, questions were designed so that responses would correspond accordingly. To measure relative risk in a way that it would be compared to the risk indices, \"Property loss,\" \"storm surge,\" and \"flooding\" were inserted into the blank for the statement, \"In comparison to the rest of developed Broward County, I feel that the risk of _______ to my home is:\" Respondents were required to select from very low, low, average, high, or very high. Respondents were also asked to identify their flood zone and evacuation zone, with the option to say \"don't know.\" These were measured with multiple-choice questions. The numeric values for elevation and depth to water table were requested in feet with a small open-response box. For the depth to water table, the question was modified for the purpose of translation to more understandable terms, \"Where you live, how many feet deep into the ground do you think that you would have to dig before you got to water (either freshwater or saltwater)?\" Saltwater was specified for respondents living right along the beach. This and many other distinctions were identified during an earlier pilot testing and peer review of the survey."}, {"section_title": "Geocoding Respondents", "text": "The respondents (N = 487) were required to give their zip code, and 475 volunteered their street of residence.

This technique is a common, yet simplified, method that is used to estimate the interactions between surge and sea-level rise (Frazier et al., 2010;Kleinosky et al., 2007;Shepard et al., 2012;Wu et al., 2002). The mechanism of the water piling up moving inland causes the SLOSH grid cells to increase in value moving inland as well, up until a point when the surge ends and the grids have a value of 99 (meaning they are dry). The grid cells were converted to points -the 99 values were removed so that the surge can be estimated moving further inland with sea-level rise. However, by the nature of the spline interpolation technique, the trend of surge height increase continued indefinitely. When the land height is increasing at a higher rate, there is a cut-off beyond which inundation ceases to occur. This is obviously not the case in Southeast Florida, given the dissipation effect as land gets lower moving west (Condon & Sheng, 2012). Therefore, the methods were modified by interpolating with a western boundary of zeroes that allowed the wave height to taper off. The depth of surge was calculated for a category 5 storm with 2 feet of sea-level rise to show the increase in exposure and to create the relative risk index. Once these heights were interpolated, the elevation was subtracted to get the depth of surge.

The survey results were compared to actual risk scenarios, based on sealevel rise projections, elevation, storm surge, flood zone, and water table surfaces. When asked to estimate future sea-level rise, 34% were accurate with the 2030 projections, and nearly half were correct for 2060 ( Figure 4.8, Figure 4.9). The percent that overestimated for 2030 and 2060, respectively, decreased from 36% to 22%. However, the percent that underestimated for 2030 and 2060, respectively, decreased from 30% to 28%. While underestimates were consistent, overestimates were much higher for 2030. There is a factor that may have led to bias here, in that 2060 had two possible right answers. This explains the increase in realistic estimates for 2060 ( Figure 4.10).  Actual: 3-7 inches Actual: 9-24 inches When asked about evacuation zone, respondents were given the option to select \"I don't know.\" While 17.7% (85 people) selected this response, the 396 people who answered were predominantly accurate, with 276 correct responses. Table 4.5 shows that the largest overestimate was for respondents guessing that they lived in Zone A. When answering the question, \"Which flood zone do you live in?\" 72% (351 people) answered \"I don't know.\" Nearly three-quarters of respondents did not know their flood zone, although 70% of them live in houses and 80% are homeowners (Figure 4.11). Of the 136 respondents that did guess their flood zone, the majority (73 people) were incorrect.

Asking similar questions in different ways allowed for misconceptions to be illuminated. In terms of relative risk, storm surge risk was most highly underestimated. The normalized curve in Figure 4.12 is shifted left towards \"very low.\" Perceived relative risk was highest for FAVA DTW, but when measured for this purpose, it was described as \"flooding.\" The results were very different when the FAVA DTW question was posed a different way, in terms of a request for a numeric estimate of \"How far below the ground is water?\" risk was most highly underestimated. While the estimations for DTW were much higher than the FAVA data, the respondents still felt at the highest risk to flooding. This suggests that there is a misconception of the current and respondents classifying themselves as experts, somewhat described the mechanisms. The elevation question was also posed differently between the numeric estimate and relative risk ranking. When the concept was presented for the relative risk as \"property loss,\" the results were fairly normalized. These normal curves were slightly skewed to the left, with 81.2% of respondents considering themselves to be low or average, and 18.8% as higher than average. In contrast, when elevation was requested as a numeric value, the results were almost evenly distributed within the index categories ( Figure 4.15 and Figure 4.16). This indicated that the perceptions for elevation are more polarized. Some respondents in the highest parts of the county estimated that they lived at sea-level. There were others in very low-lying areas that had extremely high estimations. The perceived risk does not match the actual risk for the majority of respondents and impacts. If residents understood their risk more clearly, would their behavior change? Regardless, it is important for people to know that they live in areas that are likely to be at high risk in the future. It is recommended that areas identified with wide underestimation for each impact be targeted for outreach efforts to align perceived risk with actual risk. \nThe results cover multiple perspectives on sea-level rise risk. The development of effective coastal adaptation strategies to ensure ecological, social, and economic resilience requires integrating socio-economic conditions and scenarios of climate change into risk assessment. The results that indicate socioeconomic trends for risk perception of each sealevel rise impact can be considered for this kind of assessment. Another obstacle to adaptation implementation might be the lack of support from the public. This study informs efforts to increase awareness by identifying areas where risk is underestimated. Overall, the spatial results indicate a trend moving from north to south that shifts from overestimating to underestimating elevation and storm surge. For FAVA DTW, a similar shifts occurs but it transitions from east to west. In addition to these spatial trends, there are socio-demographic trends, in which underestimation of risk is highest among lowincome populations in low-lying areas. Younger respondents and those with lower levels of education also tended to underestimate risk. These groups may be targeted for outreach. The underestimation of flood risk that was observed for inland areas suggests the misconception of vulnerability due to reduced groundwater storage. The effects of saltwater intrusion on flow and storage will be influenced by both climate and water management decisions. In terms of water management, there is a balance that must be maintained when it comes to storage. It is important to keep levels high in order to prevent saltwater intrusion to the water supply. Meanwhile, too much water storage in the wet season will lead to increasing likelihoods of groundwater pooling (Langevin and Zygnerski, 2012). Results from the spatial and socioeconomic analysis presented here suggest that Adaptation Action Areas (see section 1.3.2) might be focused to prioritize funding and improve infrastructure in low-lying areas in southeast Broward County (Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood, and Hallandale) that have vulnerable populations. Results show that these vulnerable populations tend to underestimate their risk. Targeting adaptation actions can be coupled with strategies to communicate risk and prepare residents. Such strategies are identified in regional and county strategic plans. Community outreach will likely be more effective when guided by information. Communication must address local risk, be engaging, and refer to the listeners' previous experience (Corner et al., 2012;Flugman et al., 2012;Hansen, Sato, & Ruedy, 2012;Kahan et al., 2011;Kahan, 2012;Moser, 2010a;Moser, 2010b;Moser, 2014;Norgaard, 2011). This research may contribute to further outreach efforts in Broward County in terms of locations and messages to focus on. It is important for flood risk information to be shared with inland areas, while low-lying coastal areas would benefit from learning more about storm surge and extreme tides. Content may be directed at the most common concerns of residents, as outlined in the next chapter. within these estimates will have intense impacts on the region. Impacts include property loss, erosion, flooding, and higher storm surge that moves farther inland. There are extreme adaptation actions needed for long-term solutions, and for this, managers and decisionmakers require public support. Does the collective action on the county and regional level match with individual concerns? Does the general public understand the risks related to each impact? Are residents concerned about sea-level rise? Should they be? There is an information-action gap that has been identified as a barrier to sea-level rise adaptation. This gap has been attributed to issues with risk communication and risk perception (Kahan et al., 2011;Kahan, 2012;Moser, 2010a;Moser, 2010b;Moser, 2014;Wolf & Moser, 2011).\nThe results show significant trends in information-gathering, concern, and understanding. There was a broad range of information sources lists, with internet being the most popular. The overall concern was higher than average, particularly for flooding. Respondents who answered that sea-level rise was not occurring tended to be less concerned. In the end, it was very important to have open-ended questions in the survey. The information uniquely conveyed the personal thoughts of respondents in a way that multiple-choice and numeric responses could not have done. For example, one respondent almost seemed nostalgic as he described what Broward County looked like when he was a child: \"Much of the inland area of Broward County west of Powerline Road was beautiful marshland and cypress hammocks.\" Other comments contained miscellaneous issues;\u037e there was a mention of health and a list of invasive species that may spread. The results from the survey answer analysis identified three key points. First, there were overlying misconceptions that were infused into the comments. Several respondents thought that the entire state would just be submerged underwater. There were misunderstandings related to groundwater/surface water connectivity, as a significant amount of respondents felt safe in all aspects due to living inland. Results support a substantial perspective that sea-level rise is solely a coastal issue. Secondly, there were a few concepts that respondents were distinctly aware of and continuously referred to. These were the flooding of the roads and drainage issues, rain exacerbating all events, and seasonal timescales. Lastly, when asked to explain concerns, respondents overwhelmingly provided personal considerations. The two largest groups of answers either recalled an experience or described some characteristics of their residence. Certain events that respondents had witnessed, most prominently post-Sandy erosion and damage, had heightened concerns. All of these observations can inform community outreach. The knowledge of what risks are on residents' minds and how risk messages broadcast to the public are framed is crucial. The word choices are also important. Academia and agencies use the words \"adaptation\" and \"resilience\" lavishly when describing sea-level rise solutions. Yet, these words were not supplied by the respondents. This may mean that a different kind of language is required to resonate with the general population. Use of high-frequency words from the results may be considered to explain risk effectively. Sea-level rise communication tends to be conceptual and broad. Educational material is produced for wide distribution and hence there is a difficulty to apply general concepts at the local level. However, the results here show that people relate to personal familiarity with their surroundings. Recommendations presented here are in line with these results, and they also integrate Delusca's \"vulgarization approach\" (2005). Messages need to be translated to reduce technical and broad-spectrum terms to words that people relate to. There is a need to link science with local knowledge (LSLK). This could be done by focusing on priorities that are identified by the community and by making sure that education projects stay in the context of promoting awareness where it is lacking. Communication can be supplemented by LiDAR and GIS maps to increased adaptive capacity and combine scientific knowledge with local decision-making. Strategies and tactics for a desired future must be validated and then integrated. To assess the cost of indecision and inaction, both physical and social analyses are vital. This means evaluating short-term actions, like assessing current vulnerability, and long-term goals, like revising comprehensive plans to account for sea-level rise (Parkinson, 2009). Adaptation options can range temporally, with a focus on protection for the near future, and managed withdrawal looking further ahead. The range of opportunities for resilience will be broadened with public support for intensive sea-level rise adaptation. Increasing awareness with effective communication about sea-level rise risks is vital to instigating residents towards a sense of urgency and a call to action."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The impacts of sea-level rise in South Florida are already being felt, and associated risks will continue to grow in concurrence with projections. An increase in mean sea-level will increase the height upon which storm surge builds and will push the shoreline farther inland (Kleinosky et al., 2007). The area will continue to experience increases in erosion and flooding, as well as higher storm surge and saltwater intrusion. There is a unique situation in this study area that makes inland areas vulnerable to sea-level rise. The water table is within close proximity to the land's surface. An increase in saltwater intrusion as water creeps up through the porous and permeable limestone substrate will lead to groundwater pooling for inland areas as well as coastal ones (Barlow, 2003). Therefore, areas with and without hydrological connectivity to the coast must be considered. Most sea-level rise projections have based acceleration scenarios on a quadratic curve, and this acceleration will amplify local non-linear thresholds for land loss in Broward County (Zhang, 2011). For Broward County, the threshold is 1.5m, beyond which land loss increases (Zhang, 2011). Only 5% of developed land will theoretically be below sea-level with 1.5m of sea-level rise, but by 3m, this has jumped to 79% of land. Zhang found that for 1m sea-level rise, 25,734 people are at risk to being displaced (Zhang, 2011). Table 5.1 shows how Zhang's results quantify land loss, population displaced, and property value at risk for three scenarios. For 0.5m and 1m, the land loss is greater for inland areas. Coastal areas have greater consequence by 1.5m of sea-level rise. While the implications of landward migrating shoreline are lasting, they are also predictable. Communicating scenarios and adaptation strategies in an empowering way will prepare and engage residents and decision makers. This study will link the perceived and actual risk in a way that meaningful information can be extracted from the results. Permanent inundation from sea-level rise will result in land loss, but also make adjacent structures and ecosystems more vulnerable to erosion and storm impacts (J. E. Neumann, Hudgens, Herter, & Martinich, 2010). Adaptation options must be considered economically, not just in terms of the built environment, but also based on ecosystem value. Costanza et al. (1997) conducted key research in comparing the economic value of each of the world's ecosystems. He distinguished that estuaries had one of the highest values in terms of ecosystem services. Sea-level rise can have effects on these services, and different adaptation options in response to sea-level rise will also enhance or diminish the value of coastal ecosystems. Basic adaptation options can be divided into the following: (1) Do nothing and rebuild each year (2) Accommodation: increasing building elevation and flood proofing (3) Retreat from the floodplain through easements and land use policy (4) Protect the shoreline with hard armoring (seawalls, revetments, dikes) and soft measures (beach nourishment, wetland preservation, and living shorelines) Adaptation options specific to South Florida relate strongly to natural resources management: water supply and water quality, natural systems, and effectiveness of flood control. GIS can be used to map areas and identify utilities at risk. Results can also be used to incorporate sea-level rise into planning efforts. Inundation of coastal wetlands will cause changes in ecology, which may be alleviated by ensuring that corridors for migration exist. This will help wildlife, but increased rates of sea-level rise may not allow the mangroves and other vegetation to shift quickly enough. Natural systems such as estuarine wetlands and living shorelines can serve to reduce coastal hazards through buffering of wave energy and erosion protection (Gedan, Kirwan, Wolanski, Barbier, & Silliman, 2011). One of the challenges of climate change impact and adaptation analysis is that it is difficult to assign probabilities to possible future climate conditions, particularly sea-level rise, and apply these to other factors such as population change (Titus et al., 2009). Determining drainage capacity is important and can involve acquisition of storm surge results with conversion of county groundwater models, with the application of sea-level rise scenarios. Broward County is working on creating density dependent flow models and considering technological options that may reduce saltwater intrusion, such as treated wastewater reuse as a hydraulic barrier (Zygnerski, 2013). The next step will be to use the finding to build the appropriate long-term structures and create strategies for coastal development that allow for sea-level rise. There are possibilities for local water retention and removal and these will be focused on flood-prone areas (Shugar and Obeysekera 2010).\n"}, {"section_title": "An Information Action Gap through the Lens of Vulnerability", "text": "While the scientific community has clearly laid out the physical risks, the messages might not be communicated beyond that realm. Sea-level rise is a misunderstood and miscommunicated risk (Zhang, 2011). The physical risks have not been personalized, and uncertainties with timescale have clouded concern for immediate threat. Is the risk of sealevel rise so challenging for people to perceive because it is misunderstood and unknown? Perhaps permanent inundation is confused with temporary flooding. The risks might seem unknown because this kind of inundation is unprecedented in terms of human experience on earth. In addition, there are characteristics of sea-level rise risk that make it generally perceived as less of a danger. Risk perception is reduced if it not seen as an immediate or direct threat (Starr, 1969). Perceived risk increases with the level of dread, certainty, and exposure of the risk (Slovic, Fischhoff, & Lichtenstein, 1980;Slovic, Fischhoff, & Lichtenstein, 1985). After reviewing ways to measure risk and the trade-offs between risk and benefit for land-use, Raaijmakers (2008) identifies risk perception as an essential element to planning and policy. If risk perception does not adequately line up with actual risk, the appropriate actions may not be taken (Raaijmakers, Krywkow, and van der Veen, 2008).

"}, {"section_title": "Engaging and empowering risk communication is imperative for nurturing", "text": "stakeholders' risk awareness (Moser, 2010a). The key to bridging this information-action gap is effective communication among scientists, decision-makers, and stakeholders to increase risk awareness. What are the social limits that foster pushback against adaptation? Limits to adaptation vary by society and they are correlated to ethics, knowledge, attitudes to risk, and culture (Adger et al., 2009). Attitudes to risk can be explained partly through the concept of risk perception. After reviewing ways to measure risk and the trade-offs between risk and benefit for landuse, Raaijmakers et al. (2008) identifies risk perception as an essential element to planning and policy. Risk bias occurs as a result of the nature of the risk, a lack of understanding of the risk, and the systems upon which our society and political framework exist. Individuals interpret risk based on characteristics of the hazard, such as the levels of certainty, timing, exposure, and control (Starr, 1969). Based on these concepts, sea-level rise can be classified as having an attenuated perceived risk based on its gradual, involuntary, and predictable nature. For the purpose of this study, \"understanding\" is a kind of comprehension or knowledge of how things work. \"Awareness\" is a consciousness based on observations and experiences, knowledge or perception of facts. \"Concern\" means worried and anxious but also caring. Just because one is aware that sea-level rise is occurring does not mean there is an understanding for why it is happening or a concern about impacts. Many times, understanding of information about risk is not enough to cause a change in behavior. What role does concern play in the process of individual perception of risk? In conducting focus groups to measure climate change perception, Delusca (2004) introduced the term \"vulgarization approach\" as a communication tool. Vulgarization is a means of getting scientific information to be broader, in a way that it can be available to the general public. A governance system was designed in the study to cyclically refine decision-making based on constructive feedback. Delusca (2004) used the snowballing method to recruit participants, in which participants were requested to invite others in their network to join. This methodology is also used for surveys (Rosemarie et al., 2004). Surveys are commonly used to measure risk perception and the linkages to concern, awareness and understanding. The best types of survey question to measure these depend on the format of data that is desired. How are people meant to be categorized? What is the intention of the survey? Fowler (2002) says that virtually identical questions can be designed to be either open-or closed-ended questions. Each method has distinct advantages. One advantage of open-ended questions, in which the respondent is free to fill in whatever response comes to mind, is that bias is reduced when there is no range of \"suggested\" answers to choose from. Often, unanticipated answers are given about issues which the researcher may not have even considered. It allows the most concise description of the respondent's real views to be depicted. Respondents tend to appreciate this because they like using their own words (Fowler, 2002). The problem with this is that the resulting QCA, also called inducted category development, is a methodical way to interpret conflicting opinions and unsolved issues (Graneheim & Lundman, 2004). Hsieh (2005) defines the analysis as going well beyond word count; it is a complex classification of large amounts of diverse information into categories with similar meanings. A systematic coding process can help identify themes and patterns in qualitative data. Of the three distinct approaches to qualitative content analysis, defined by Hsieh (2005), conventional content analysis (CCA) is most appropriate when there is limited information about theories, and where the focus is to gain new insight. Using the CCA technique requires the researcher to design the open-ended question using a thought-provoking probe, such as, \"Why did you choose these concerns?\" This kind of probe gives respondents the space to choose their own words and ideas with minimal suggestions. Thoughts can be organized in many ways. Conventional content analysis begins with observation; keywords are derived from the data after it has been collected. An initial analysis requires the researcher to read the answers and consider how different answers had converging ideas. The emergent categories are subsequently created to organize answers into meaningful clusters. These new groups may be ranked by recurrence throughout the answers by completing word counts for correlated descriptions or by grouping answers based on unifying themes. Another way to correlate various perspectives on a topic is to use a word tree. Word tree is a new information-retrieval technique that provides an alternative to the \"keywordin-context\" method (Wattenberg & Vi\u00e9gas, 2008). Word trees allow for qualitative assessment of comments with unifying themes (Bilgihan, Severt, & Kandampully, 2013). A survey was conducted by the Gulf of Mexico Alliance (GOMA) to determine the coastal community resilience priorities of 1,668 professionals (Sempiere, 2013). Word trees were used to determine categories and subcategories of response that were specific to focus areas including climate, sea-level, and communication. The number of references to each priority were also quantified to rank the perceived criticality."}, {"section_title": "Data Collection and Analysis", "text": "Between September and December 2013, an online survey was distributed to Broward County residents. The snowball sampling method used for distribution begins with a very small group of individuals, who then refer the researcher to others with potentially relevant information or perspective (Delusca, 2004;Rosemarie et al., 2004). Respondents were asked to rank their level of knowledge and concern about sea-level rise via multiple-choice questions, and open-ended responses were used to measure awareness and understanding. The questions that asked about specific concerns (for today and for 50 years from now) allowed the respondent to check as many boxes as desired as well as to write in further text details.

Next, an organizing phase entailed preparing each set of openresponse answers by sorting all responses according to select multiple-choice answers (i.e., is sea-level rise occurring?). Excel spreadsheet columns were sorted in the context of concern indicated and by which concerns were indicated. As key concerns surfaced, they were tallied in order to measure the frequency of occurrence. Answers were then arranged by location to determine if there were inland/coastal, high/low elevation trends or any other spatial patterns. Respondents were categorized based on parts of their answers that referred to the type of evidence used to justify concerns, for example personal experience.

Finally, the wordle.com and word tree (www.jasondavies.com/wordtree) tools were used to create visual representations of the most prevalent ideas and word choices for both future and current concerns."}, {"section_title": "Information Sources", "text": "There were 401 results for the optional question that asked, \"Which sources of information, if any, do you feel have informed you the most about sea-level rise?\" Most of the write-in answers to this question listed numerous sources. Some answers referred to general sources the most popular of which were television, news, and internet. Table 6.1 shows how the general and more particular answers were categorized. For example, the word television or TV was input 71 times, and the frequency at which specific channels and shows were listed is a subcategory. The most popular of the more distinct results were the Discovery Channel, the Sun Sentinel, and South Florida's National Public Radio station, WLRN. Internet/web/online was the most popular of the generalized phrases, with a count of 78; however, only a handful of actual links were provided. The most popular link was www.350.org, which was listed 4 times. The survey did not mention the words climate change or global warming, and the intention was to maintain a scope. However, it was interesting to observe the frequency in which respondents used these words. Table 6.3 reflects that the phrase climate change was used more often than global warming, but sea-level rise was still ranked above both. There were two comments in which \"none\" was stated. There were another three comments from respondents that took this space to express lack of concern. One called sea-level rise a \"hype\" and the other stated: \"I believe global warming is a way to control people, and for individuals like Al Gore and major corporations to make money on terror tactics, like flooding. For governments to make money with carbon taxes, etc. I have been to Alaska, seen all the glaciers, and yes they recede, but that is nature. Now the ice packs in the Arctic are so much thicker this year.\" Al Gore and the movie he wrote/starred in, \"Inconvenient Truth\", were mentioned another nine times. All of these were positive with the exception of one other respondent calling the former vice president a \"fraud.\" One comment referenced the website \"www.iceagenow.info,\" which will show \"lack of sea-level rise.\" These negative comments were correlated to trends in which these respondents described themselves as being \"extremely familiar\" with sea-level rise and also as having no concerns."}, {"section_title": "Characterizing Concerns", "text": "The results show that overall concern is ranked highest for very high, high and medium concern,, with only 5.2% of respondents claiming to have no concern ( Figure 6.2). When the concerns were categorized by impact and timescale, there were some shifts.  Figure 6.3 shows the distribution of responses for the three concerns and their various combinations. Property loss is the largest increase for looking 50 years ahead, and the shift to selecting property loss reduced the concerns for storm surge and flooding. Although the questions asked for risks (plural) to be selected, it is possible that many respondents did not realize that they were able to select more than one box. This source of error would explain why there were so many fewer responses that included multiple impacts."}, {"section_title": "Figure 6.3: Concerns by Impact and Timescale", "text": "For the 63 respondents who selected other and wrote in the blank for questions 5 or 6, the answers which were typed in were considered. The most prominent response among these were 10 answers related to water supply and saltwater intrusion. For the biggest future Today 50 years concern, seven out of the thirty-two responses were similar to \"I won't be here/will be dead.\" Other current concerns included insurance (2), evacuation/roadways (2), property devaluation (2), erosion, and sinkholes. Future concerns were mainly focused on economic losses and damage to infrastructure."}, {"section_title": "Open-Response Content Results", "text": "The second to last item on the survey asked respondents (question C7), \"Please briefly explain your choices for current and/or future concerns chosen from questions 5 and 6 above,\" in reference to the questions in Figure 6.1. There were 288 responses filled into the large space provided for this request. The last question (question C8) asked, \"How does sea-level affect flooding, storm surge, and extreme tides?\" This optional question was answered 260 times. The most common word among the answers to both of these questions was flood. Table 6.7 lists the words that were written most frequently for each. One important source of error with the methodology relates to the survey question order and design. The wording in the survey was kept as simple and consistent as possible in order to maintain the limitations of the scope and to keep the respondent focused. Previous questions had already planted some words (storm surge, property, and flooding) in the readers' minds. Therefore, it is expected that the answers would mention the three impacts and those would be considered in a different light. The three impacts were indeed the top three phrases in the frequency analysis. Other words from the survey, such as water, live, home and high came next. However, many other important words came up that were not included in the scope of the survey. From over 500 open-response comments, some clear common tendencies emerged. In general, most respondents were clearly concerned and demonstrated a general understanding of their vulnerability. As a large part of the circulation of the survey was to professionals, there was bias to have some expert opinions and intelligent responses. There were also a significant number of individuals who either stated a complete lack of concern or argued against the need for concern. All of these categories of responses were sorted and qualitatively assessed into the following groups."}, {"section_title": "I live\u2026", "text": "The largest inclination among respondents to explain their concerns was to describe where they lived. Figure 6.4 shows a word tree that helps to visualize the kinds of \"branches\" that were most prevalent in the explanations."}, {"section_title": "Figure 6.4: Word Tree of Explanations Describing Location", "text": "The full set of survey answers were edited to maintain privacy and then they were posted on the public database, so that anyone can go to the link and explore the answers at .http://www-958.ibm.com/software/analytics/manyeyes/visualizations/new/wordtree/slr/1, accessed 10/28/14). Table 6.5 shows the proportions of responses that described location, categorized by the kind of description. Nearly half of the justifications that involved describing the location of a residence were related to being inland or west. These rationalizations mainly explained the reason that storm surge was less of a concern or that flooding was more of a concern. For example, \"I live far enough inland not to be affected by storm surge or tidal flooding.\" Another large group of respondents explained that living either on the coastal ridge or at high elevation justified their lack of concern or their feelings of less vulnerable than the rest of the County. About a quarter of these location-description-themed answers involved proximity to the coast or to a tidally influenced waterway. These responses indicated an overall sense of vulnerability to flooding and surge, with some references to property loss. There were many references to living near or far from another water body, and the overall count for these words was very high (canal-36 & lake-22). "}, {"section_title": "Experience/Observation", "text": "The second most common explanation described an experience or an observation. Many respondents described the proximity within which floodwater had reached their home, or in which part of their home has flooded. Respondents described damage to personal property and water levels in relation to their home, the road, and nearby water bodies. Respondents also recalled seeing erosion, extreme tides, and compromised drainage. Common quote excerpts from these groups were similar to, \"I see the water from the storm drains rise and sit during high tide,\" or \"You can already tell that the beaches are being eroded.\" Several of these comments mentioned that \"This was scary.\" The most popular reference, which came up 12 times, was to the erosion that ate away from beneath State Road A1A during Hurricane Sandy. Respondents also frequently pointed out that things have changed over time. For example, one response stated, \"I have traveled this section of road since 1987 and never saw it closed due to high water until last summer.\" Another said, \"I have seen much higher water levels than ever recently\u2026.lived here more than 20 years.\" With these references to the past, there were also many statements with the word \"already\" to convey that these impacts are happening now. \"Already\" was used 36 times in the survey, indicating that the respondents are currently seeing changes. One respondent stated, \"Street flooding from extreme high tides caused by reverse flow through sewers already happens a few times a year.\""}, {"section_title": "Inland/Low Relief", "text": "While being inland and at high elevations was brought up to support lack of concern, it was also referred to in describing how surge and flooding will get worse with sea-level rise. There were 30 references to either the low topography or to flooding and storm surge reaching farther inland, as respondents explained vulnerability to sea-level rise. The word \"further\" was used 20 times in this context. For example, \"While sea-level rise itself does not cause these events to occur, the events will impact larger areas and will become more prevalent further inland than they have been in the past.\" One coastal resident explained, \"Many people expect because we are between the ocean and intercoastal, that we are at highest risk to storms, but once the ocean settles after a storm, the water will leave. However, steadied inland flooding could sit around those homes for days on end\u2026seems to be of lesser concern.\" A few respondents stated that South Florida is flat."}, {"section_title": "Extreme or Emotional", "text": "There were 26 comments that either expressed exaggerated predictions of calamity or intense emotion. There were several statements that were similar to, \"All of Florida will be underwater in 50 years,\" or \"I live inland but soon I will have beachfront property.\" Some respondents wanted to know when to sell their homes, and one stated, \"I have to sell my home to a climate change denier soon!\" One respondent painted a dire scenario: \"The southern tip of Florida, or even the whole of Florida, could flood and be gone in 30 years or less. Storm surges will destroy streets and buildings and people will have to relocate and lose their homes, maybe lose their lives\u2026\" On the other side of the spectrum, a respondent that denied any sea-level rise stated, \"By creating a panic, real estate values will plummet, and the economy of Florida, and governments at all levels, will collapse.\" Another comment, \"Municipalities have long sold their souls to developers\u2026I can't wait until\u2026the shoreline starts to reclaim property that was never supposed to be for sale,\" and \"Nature will want this land back someday. Just because you fill it in and plunk on insta-slums doesn't mean the water went anywhere, it's still there.\" Many respondents expressed sadness at the thought of losing their homes. For example, \"The loss of my property would force me to move; I will have to leave the place I love the most,\" or, \"It would be devastating to lose our home.\" Several respondents expressed financial concern: \"All of my money right now is in my home.\" There were 4 comments that mentioned future generations as reasons for concern. These comments included statements similar to \"I am most concerned and sad for my kids and their kids,\" or, \"I doubt we will continue to have this property in the future. (For our children) It's just determining the right time to sell.\""}, {"section_title": "Infrastructure: Drainage", "text": "Drainage was another high-occurrence word. Many respondents blamed flooding on poor drainage. Others noted that they saw how water levels were controlled, i.e., canals were pumped low by water managers before expected storms. However, the majority of comments that mentioned drainage described in some way how sea-level rise would make it more difficult. For example, \"As sea-level rises, it is more and more difficult for storm water to leave the urbanized areas because there is nowhere for it to go.\" The word \"gravity\" came up 8 times as these respondents conveyed an understanding of the effects on compromised water control structures. Another comment read, \"We will go from a few hours of inland flooding to days when the land will not drain.\""}, {"section_title": "Infrastructure: Roads", "text": "Water in the roads was frequently mentioned as a reason for concern. In addition to compromising travel, evacuation was a worry voiced by many respondents. One respondent wrote, \"Some portions of major evacuation routes are already likely to flood,\" and another wrote, \"We will see problems in the future with evacuations and safety.\" Respondents had an overall sense that the roads were lower than their homes' foundations and that the criticality would increase as impassable streets become more than a nuisance. One comment stated, \"My specific property is not as risky as the access roads and other elements of the community that make a home livable.\" While for the survey \"property loss\" was intended to be a home, several respondents referred to their car. For example, one respondent explained concern that \"property loss due to driving through flooded streets is more likely.\" Threatened transportation and vehicles was a theme that was connected to many other ideas. One respondent wanted to explain a misconception by saying, \"most people think of sea-level rise as beach erosion or something that just happens to the most coastal streets.\" Another respondent connected it to his knowledge of the seasons and tides: \"As sea-level rises, seasonal flooding covers more of the street twice a day.\""}, {"section_title": "Groundwater/Saltwater Intrusion", "text": "There were 36 comments that referred in some way to groundwater. The majority essentially conveyed an understanding of the water table rising. These comments came from respondents who gave extremely intuitive answers overall. The other portion of the comments that referred to groundwater expressed concern for the water supply. There were 3 comments that specifically mentioned landscaping challenges.

Groundwater levels will increase and that will impact low lying western areas more that low lying coastal areas due to sealevel rise. Seawater getting into the groundwater and Lake Okeechobee, necessitating expensive desalinization. Raising the overall water table will bring much of that inland water above ground.

Solutions were not requested in the prompt; however, there were 16 comments from respondents who felt the need to offer them. Most of these referred to the raising of buildings and changing building codes. One respondent wrote, \"There will be a need to build buildings higher off grade, and raise street levels, beach nourishment will become more frequent and costly, and may have to be eliminated. Homes along the beaches, if washed away should not be rebuilt. Zoning laws must be changed.\" One comment mentioned protection: \"My best choice is to build up my sea wall and reinforce it, or sell and move to higher elevation.\" There were mentions in these comments of planning and preparation. One respondent suggested, \"Education of the public is a must. I am not sure what the best way is to educate people about this real threat.\" Two comments mentioned a Band-Aid: \"The climate fix needs more than a Band-Aid approach,\" and \"The extensive use of pumps and flood gates are expensive and a Band-Aid fix.\" Another comment mentioned that these pumps were energy-intensive and therefore contribute further to the problem. There was one response in which all of the suggested solutions related to reduction in fossil fuel usage. Several respondents described ways in which they had changed their behavior as a result of their concerns. The majority of these comments related to past or future choice of where to live or in which kind of residence to live. One comment was, \"I am looking to purchase a home and am concerned with finding a location that is not at risk.\" Another was, \"In order to prevent property loss I will probably live in an apartment.\" One respondent explained how she desired to live farther east, but would not feel comfortable due to flooding she has seen east of Federal Highway."}, {"section_title": "Economic Considerations", "text": "A popular reason for concern among respondents was related to insurance, development and tax. Many respondents wanted to explain that they did not have flood insurance and couldn't understand why they were not required to. For example: \"We have not been able to purchase flood insurance. We thought this seemed odd given the home's location.\" Table 6.7 shows other comments with representative concerns. When we purchased our home, between the ocean and Intercoastal, we were told it was not in a designated flood zone I will not get the full price for my condo. Cities' weak construction codes and irresponsible developers building near the ocean that make these issues worse than they have to be. Even though the people complain about taxes they have to pay, they expect government to help I am not in a flood plain, but I carry flood insurance since my street floods every heavy rain, hurricane or not. There will be undoubtedly a decrease in home values in south Florida within the next 50 years. The denser with properties these areas become, the more problems we will see in the future. My tax dollars WILL NOT be going to ANY mitigation for private property or infrastructure in high-risk areas. I live in a no flood zone so I have been led to believe I am at little to no risk. Increased flooding or surge may totally decrease the value of my property. Two comments related to the economic losses due to reduced tourism on the (lack of) beaches. A few respondents were angry that their tax money was going to pay to protect properties in vulnerable areas. One respondent mentioned the costs from \"unnecessary retreat\u2026the cities get 20-30% less property tax revenue, and then the sea-level doesn't change that much.

Some of these comments were antagonistic, such as \"Would like a reply, how much did this survey cost, who is pushing it, what is the goal?\", \"Bring on Global Warming!\", and \"NO GLOBAL WARMING!\" One respondent was more concerned about what he called hype: \"I am concerned that my property will not be sellable if newspaper/TV articles continue.\" Another respondent stated, \"These predictions, driven by scientists who get their funding from people who want to promote global warming as a threat to the future of this planet. So their studies reflect what their funding wants it to reflect. Without any doubt, the deficits and liabilities being run up by the government are a bigger threat to our society than global warming.\" This respondent went on to blame the increase on emissions on developing countries and to end by saying that the \"whole thing is very distressing.\" One respondent found a possible benefit from sea-level rise, \"Perhaps a rise in the water table would resolve the fact that I cannot use my boat within 2 hours of low tide.\" Another respondent gave a questionable lesson on the carbon cycle: \"There is no sea-level rise. Its scare tactics from the AGW (Anthropogenic Global Warming) crowd. They have it backwards, the oceans heat first and then release CO2, kind of like if you put a can of soda out to heat it up; it releases CO2 faster. Heating causes CO2 which is not a greenhouse gas. Worry more about water vapor, which then turns to snow.\" In contrast to the doubt and denial, many respondents use language to convey certainty of risk. For example, \"proven sea-level rise\", \"I know it is coming\", \"Everything I read says\", \"Scientific studies show...\" and \"it is a fact that sea-levels are rising worldwide.\" One comment was: \"Whether we agree about the causes or not, sea-level rise could reclaim much of South Florida for the Everglades.\""}, {"section_title": "Spatial Trends for Concern Levels", "text": "An important distinction relates to stigma attached to the phrases \"sea-level rise\", \"climate change\", and \"global warming\". The author was very careful not to use the two subsequent phrases and to limit the scope to sea-level rise. However, related terms came up quite frequently among the open-response answers. Global warming was used nearly twice as much as climate change was. Was there a term that was more prevalent among those who had doubts that there was any kind of threat? The data shows that the 54 out of 487 respondents who selected \"no\" in response to \"Is sea-level rise occurring?\" used global warming slightly more among all of the open response. When asked to rank their average concern on a scale of 1-5, the average among \"no\" respondents was 2.24 (std. dev. 1.08) compared to 3.56 (std. dev. 1.11) for respondents who did think that sea-level was rising. When the respondents were sorted by location (inland/coastal, high/low elevation) the lowest percentage of \"no\" respondents occurred in the most resilient (high elevation/inland) areas with only 8.9%, compared to the other averages which were closer to 12. Table 6.9 illustrates this trend as well as others related to spatial characteristics. In terms of ranking levels of understanding, the distributions were very similar, with the most prevalent response being \"somewhat familiar.\" However, the curves for these levels of concern for these groups was very different.

The numbers reflected are a ratio of the frequency of occurrence to total number of responses for that category. Respondents who said \"no\" were even more concerned about current flooding, and they were also much more likely to respond by writing in \"none.\" The biggest jump between current and future concerns was for property loss among \"yes\" respondents  The most significant sources of error were sampling error and coverage error. These seem inherent in their snowballing method of assembling participants through personal references. If a participant thought that the results would make a difference, he/she might be more likely to refer someone who shared common views. The main advantage for the methodology was flexibility. Sometimes qualitative data is more valuable when being used to measure awareness and decision-making. If a survey had been done with only limited answer options, certain issues may have been overlooked. The unique respondent perspective provides results that are useful in designing strategies for increasing awareness among stakeholders."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "A recurring theme throughout this dissertation is the relationship between the vulnerability of people and the vulnerability of where they live. The results show reasonable concern for future sea-level rise in general among Broward County residents. However, a portion of respondents had opposing and extreme views. These ranged from apparent bitter denial to exaggerated anticipation of future peril. Linkages between awareness and concern were observed, but there was a spatial variation in how these elements correlated to risk bias. Much of the concern observed was supported by personal experience. In the open-ended responses, respondents expressed confidence that they understood the risks to their homes. However, when estimating relative risk, elevation, and FAVA DTW, it was clear that misconceptions clouded their interpretations. These results can be used to facilitate future actions and outreach strategies. The language used by respondents indicates wording that would be effective for constructing compelling messages. The experiences, observations, and concerns expressed by respondents can guide future communications. With this guidance, outreach can be designed to resonate with communities. These results support three key recommendations for outreach to increase risk awareness: (1) refer to local, visible, and tangible examples, both coastal and inland; (2) provoke the recollection of personal experience that relates to the risk; and (3) rectify misconceptions, particularly in respect to groundwater lifting. The study's research questions were answered in way that effectively characterized sea-level rise risks and the public perception of these risks in Broward County, Florida. Firstly, a vulnerability index quantified physical and socioeconomic risk to reveal that southeast and central Broward County have areas that are most vulnerable to sea-level rise in terms of impact and consequence. It was clear that the actual risk based on elevation and storm surge data increased moving from the north part of the county to the south. Meanwhile, the risk to groundwater flooding is higher for inland areas that border the Everglades. Next, the layer of perceived risk was added to the analysis, and it was clear that perception is was not aligned with reality. Survey results showed that realistic respondents were in the minority for all levels of analysis. When self-classifying their relative risk, residents of the higher elevation areas in North Broward were overestimating their risk to storm surge and loss of property. The risk to groundwater flooding was most drastically underestimated by residents of inland areas. However, underestimating the depth to water table was a perpetual trend throughout the results. There was a discrepancy between the numeric and interval responses for perceived risk to flooding. This is likely to be a result of confusion with the various kinds of flooding. Inland flooding can result from a combination of influences: precipitation, poor drainage, impermeable surfaces, and reduced soil storage capacity. Coastal flooding is caused by these stimuli as well as by extreme tides and storm surge. Sea-level rise has the potential to move storm surge farther inland. Sea-level rise can also exacerbate flooding during a storm or extreme tides as it will continue to compromise and overload drainage systems. These flood-related distinctions were not made in the survey, as a sacrifice was made in an effort to keep the survey simple. The tradeoff was justified as the open-response allowed for the respondents to volunteer their interpretation of flooding and sea-level rise interactions. The strategy for the wording of the questions asking for numeric and relative risk estimates led to some insight on the perceived risk to flooding. When asked to rank relative risk and to list concerns, the word \"flooding\" was used. This word elicited the largest overestimation of risk and highest concern. Residents are clearly concerned about flooding. Yet, when respondents were asked to estimate depth to water table, the majority of guesses were much higher than the actual depth. Over half of respondents lived in an area where the FAVA DTW was between 2 and 5ft. However, only 22% estimated distances in that range. Nearly half of respondents estimated a FAVA DTW over 9ft when only 4% actually had the water table so deep. This suggests that most respondents do not consider groundwater flooding as a riska risk which will increase with sea-level rise. This inference is supported by the overwhelming amount of open response answers that brought up living inland or at high elevation to justify lack of concern. There was also a misconception evident in how respondents envisaged elevation with respect to FAVA DTW. Only 45% of respondents correctly identified that elevation must be a value that is greater than FAVA DTW. When respondents were asked to rate their level of risk relative to the rest of the county, the largest overestimation of risk was to storm surge. Respondents were least realistic when estimating relative risk to property loss. The numeric responses for elevation and FAVA DTW estimates showed polarized perceptions. While only 1% of respondents lived below 3ft, 15% wrote in numbers in this range. There was also a much large number of respondents who thought that they lived at an elevation above 12ft. When predicting future sea-level rise increments, there was no statistically significant trend for over-or underestimating. The majority of respondents were unaware of their flood zone and evacuation zone. Finally, the open-response questions showed the most insight into the thoughts behind respondents' perceptions. The words and methods that respondents chose to justify their concerns indicated meaningful ways in which evidence was gathered and opinions were formed. Most respondents described where they lived to support their concerns of lack thereof. Many respondents recalled experiencing damage from storms or flooding. If an individual residence is not highly impacted by sea-level rise, there are still personal implications to that resident. While there were a few references to being concerned about the beach, there was a lack of expressed concern for the overall quality of lifefor impacts to vulnerable areas in the county that would affect all residents. The increase in Earth's sea-level is a truly tangible and visible consequence of changes in climate. All of the sea-level rise influences discussed here carry a range of uncertainties, but the overall trend among all of them is that sea-level is indeed rising. It is not a matter of \"if\", but \"when?\" and \"by how much?\" This new reality of climate change and sea-level rise will require innovative planning and management changes in order to decrease the risks of inundation and extreme weather (Parkinson, 2009). While it is important to aim at reducing uncertainty in climate projections and models, it is also important to reduce uncertainty among citizens. With the underestimation of risk measured here, the information currently available (historical tide gauge data, satellite altimetry, and future projections) doesn't seem to be enough to resonate. The accessibility and the delivery of the data must be considered. Perhaps it would be advantageous to translate the intricate science to simplified yet compelling information. In order to promote awareness and develop stewardship, it is critical to understand the reasoning behind stakeholder perceptions. How can communication modify perceived risk to match more closely to actual risk? Is there a single message that will convey the risk of sea level rise? What message can create enough traction to stimulate the drastic adaptation measures that are required to protect the invaluable natural and built environment in South Florida? Risk communication is more effective when it is tailored to a specific community and even a certain individual. Awareness may be increased in a way that addressed the key concerns of residents and refers to their personal experience and to impacts that are already happening. Results presented here indicate a severe underestimation and a lack of understanding of sea-level rise risks. Further inquiry is recommended to explore ways to align risk perception to more accurately parallel actual risk."}, {"section_title": "APPENDICES APPENDIX A -DATA SPECIFICATIONS FOR LIDAR", "text": "Tables A.1 and A.2 below summarize the deliverables for terrestrial LiDAR.
