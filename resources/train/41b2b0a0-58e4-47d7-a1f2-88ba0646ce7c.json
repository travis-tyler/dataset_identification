Many people living with the condition of TBI have unmet needs. Research among people living with TBI in rural areas is limited. The purposes of this study were to 1) increase understanding of the lived experience of people with TBI and caregivers in rural regions of Kentucky across the continuum of their care and 2) provide their perspectives on barriers and facilitators of optimal function and well-being.\nMethods-A qualitative descriptive interview study was conducted by a multidisciplinary team. Content analysis was completed with data-derived coding and iterative modifications to analysis, coalescing codes into categories and themes.\nResults-Thirteen people with TBI and six caregivers participated in the interview. Categories that emerged in analysis included the experiences under each locus of care; themes included relationships, functional competence, and participation in meaningful activity.\nrepresented both barriers and facilitators of well-being. Major unmet needs persisted in terms of medical problems, support for caregivers, community linkages, and participation in meaningful activities. Recommendations are made regarding avenues for addressing unmet needs.\nBackground Masel and DeWitt [32] emphasized that people with TBI have a chronic condition as defined by the World Health Organization [52] . The event of TBI causes or hastens the progression of secondary long term pathologies such as neurodegenerative disorders, neuroendocrine disorders, neuromuscular disorders, seizures, sleep dysfunction, psychiatric pathology, incontinence, sexual dysfunction, and metabolic dysregulation [32] . An analysis of rehospitalization of people with TBI found a 20% rate in years one and five after the TBI for reasons such as general medical problems, seizures, psychiatric problems, fractures, and surgeries or procedures addressing problems sustained in the accident causing the TBI [31] . A recent study indicated older age, mechanism of injury being a fall, greater injury severity, rural residence, greater comorbidity and psychiatric comorbidity to all be significant predictors of re-hospitalization 3 years post-injury [43] . A leading task force from the Galveston Brain Injury Conference emphasized that people with TBI need support over their lifetime [29] .\nCorrigan [10] summarized eleven statewide assessments of people with TBI indicating that the majority had unmet needs in the areas of memory, income, job skills/employment, education, and stress management. Only 16% worked full time and 17% worked part time. Unmet needs identified in other research included social networking, transportation, balance and coordination difficulties and family stressors [18, 21, 26, 27, 33, 36, 47, 53] . In Kentucky the findings were similar [50] . Levack and colleagues [27] completed a meta-analysis of qualitative studies examining the lived experiences of people with TBI and found several primary themes including: disconnects from one's previous self, social disconnect, emotional sequelae, the challenges of accessing internal and external resources, and challenges reconstructing their identity and place in the world.\nMoreover, a Cochrane review of research examining effectiveness of intervention programs for people with TBI found little significant outcomes in quality of life, community reintegration or change in caregiver burden in response to interventions that were studied [48] . Research related to caregiver experiences is very limited, although Lefebvre, Cloutier, and Josee [25] found that the challenges experienced by caregivers were, not surprisingly, associated with the unmet needs of the individual with TBI. Caregiver demands are unique for each family [35] and assistance needed may include monitoring medications, managing challenging behaviors, adjusting to sexuality expression, responding to drug and alcohol abuse, and learning how to advocate for vital services [12] . Having someone with a moderate to severe TBI can impact every member of the family such as parents dealing with extended parenthood, spouses dealing with adjustments to partner roles, and siblings feeling neglected [12] . Caregiver stress has multifactorial negative outcomes. The caregiver is at risk for diminished health and quality of life, but the persons being cared for also have poorer physical and psychosocial outcomes when the caregiver experiences high levels of burden and depression [37] . Overlooked in published reports is the evolution of needs over time as care settings, functioning, and personal roles change. This change over time may account for the variety of findings in studies of TBI caregiver needs [37] . Harrison et al. "}, {"section_title": "", "text": "The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) indicated that people from rural areas were at increased risk for TBI [6] . Moreover, they were at increased risk of developing secondary medical conditions due to lack of availability and accessibility of medical and other resources, and rural residence is a predictor of re-hospitalization in the TBI population [43] . Two studies found that rural populations with TBI tended to be more functionally dependent, have lower health statuses at follow up, and have fewer resources for support [17, 40] . One study demonstrated limited rehabilitation resources in rural areas of the United States, posing a significant barrier to outcomes [22] . Systemic barriers to rehabilitation and functional gains for those with TBI in rural areas included a lack of a coordinated approach among health care and community service providers, difficulties in locating appropriate services, challenges in identifying professionals with TBI expertise, and inability to find employment [22, 41, 46] . Bellon and colleagues [4] completed a study of people with acquired brain injury and caregivers, and found the top three themes related to family support needs were: 1) counselling and financial support, 2) family support groups, and 3) coordinated, accessible, and tailored services. Coordinated, accessible, and tailored services was identified more frequently by those living in rural and remote areas [4] .\nThe scope and magnitude of the problem of chronic medical conditions among rural Kentuckians, especially those in Appalachian Kentucky, are well documented [11, 20, 39, 44] . In 2014, 54 of Kentucky's 120 counties were classified as rural, and 42% of the Kentucky population had rural residency. All but nine of the 54 rural counties were economically distressed based on analysis of median income and poverty rate, and socioeconomic indicators (e.g. education, health, health care access, employment, income) were all lower in rural areas as compared to urban [9] . Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in Kentucky is prevalent and comes with a high cost of health care. The Kentucky Data Surveillance Network [3] determined that approximately 37,000 people sustained TBIs in Kentucky in 2013, with the primary mechanism of injury being motor vehicle accidents or falls. Of those, 33,593 were treated and released from an emergency department (ED), with ED charges estimated at $140,346,239. An estimated 3,458 were hospitalized at a cost of $205,496,481 for acute care direct costs or post-acute care charges for rehabilitation. Indirect costs related to chronic conditions and quality of life are difficult to quantify.\nThe Kentucky Appalachian Rural Rehabilitation Network (KARRN) initiated a series of studies to characterize the lives of people living with neurological impairments in rural Kentucky as a first step to improving services, support systems and quality of life among these populations. Two KARRN studies have been completed which examined the needs of people with spinal cord injury (SCI) [23] and stroke [11] . People with TBI are varied from those with SCI and stroke in impairments sustained, outcomes, and available financial and health care resources. This third study was designed to explore the experiences of people with TBI in rural areas.\nResearch among people living with TBI in rural areas is limited, and there is no published research on the recovery process and continuum of care following a TBI in rural Kentucky. The purposes of this study were to 1) increase understanding of the lived experience of people with TBI and caregivers in rural Kentucky across the continuum of their care and 2) to provide their perspectives on barriers and facilitators of optimal functioning and well-being. This project focused exclusively on traumatic brain injury. Previously this research team conducted a similar study with people living with stroke [11] and we plan to examine the similarities and differences of these populations. This information will be used in the continued development of supports and linkages for people with TBI who live in rural areas."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "A qualitative descriptive interview study [42] was conducted using a team approach [7] . A multidisciplinary research team consisting of a physical therapist, an occupational therapist, and a health communications specialist provided diverse professional perspectives in the interview and analysis process. This was deemed optimal because of the varied impairments people with TBI experience [15] . The institutional review boards for the University and for the health facilities whose databases were used in recruitment, approved the study.\nThe inclusion criteria for the individuals in this study were as follows: 1) People with traumatic brain injury sustained at least 6 months ago in order to find participants who had transitioned through the continuum of care, and/or a caregiver for the individual who sustained the TBI 2) Residence in Kentucky 3) Twenty-one years of age or older in order not to qualify as a minor per the Internal Review Board standards at the time and 4) Ability to participate in one interview (individual and/or caregiver) that lasts up to 60-90 minutes. Rural residency was examined using the USDA Rural-Urban Continuum Codes [49] . Approximately 125 recruitment flyers were mailed to former patients of two rehabilitation hospitals, identified from patient databases, who fit the inclusion criteria. Each respondent received a phone call to further identify inclusion criteria and informed consent was obtained from each participant."}, {"section_title": "Semi", "text": "-structured, open-ended interviews [13] were conducted following development of the interview guide by the team through a series of team meetings (appendix A). Three researchers served as interviewers. Interview locations were determined by participants and included participants' homes, regional hospital meeting centers, and residential nursing facilities. Interviews with participant dyads (person with TBI and caregiver) or with participants separately were determined by participant preference. Demographic data including age, race, sex, ethnicity, education level, county of residence, occupation, employment status, marital status, annual income, current medications, number of TBIs and number of years post-TBI were also collected. The interviews typically lasted 90 minutes. To improve descriptive validity during the interview participants were asked to recount their experience in several ways. To increase interpretive validity, iterative questions were used to further clarify participants' responses. Field notes and reflective memos were recorded by the interviewer immediately post-interview. The interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and checked for accuracy. All transcriptions were de-identified using participant self-selected pseudonyms.\nQualitative content analysis, the preferred approach to analysis for a qualitative descriptive study was completed with data-derived coding, and iterative modifications to analysis as new data were collected [42] . This project used a qualitative team approach. The goal for analysis was to achieve inter-coder agreement. Unlike inter-coder reliability that requires that two or more equally capable coders operating in isolation from each other select the same code for the same unit of text, inter-coder agreement requires that two or more coders are able to reconcile through discussion whatever coding discrepancies they may have for the same unit of text [5] . This technique works well with qualitative team work, particularly if the team members come from different disciplines. For this project, the team analyzed the first three transcripts together to develop an agreed upon coding schema. At that point individual team members analyzed individual transcripts. After all the interviews were analyzed individually, a group discussion was conducted to again ensure team agreement on analysis and findings. This allowed for a final development of a categorization scheme through iterative analysis and rechecks by the entire research team. After agreement was reached on coding and categorization, individual researchers re-analyzed 2-3 interviews using the final categorization scheme. A team discussion of the final analysis and theme development took place. Each interviewer also triangulated the findings with their field notes and reflective memos that were developed with each interview. Finally member checks were conducted with three participants as analysis took place. The member checks confirmed our initial analysis."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Thirteen individuals (10 male, 3 female) with TBI, and 6 caregivers (2 male, 4 female) were included in this study. Eleven of the individuals with TBI were able to verbally participate in the interview process. The remaining two individuals, although present during the interviews, were unable to communicate in the interview process with their caregivers due to physical limitations secondary to their injury. Ten different counties were represented in this study as seen in figure 1 . A summary of the demographic information for all participants (caregivers and those with TBI) can be found in table 1 with specific demographic data by code name in table 2.\nA descriptive summary of the participants' narratives across the continuum of care is presented categorically within the following structure: 1) TBI onset and emergency care 2) Acute care 3) Inpatient rehabilitation 4) Transitioning home and reintegration into the rural community."}, {"section_title": "TBI onset and emergency care", "text": "The TBI was caused by a motor vehicle accident for eleven of thirteen participants with one being the result of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and one being due to complications from surgical removal of a brain tumor.

The majority of participants reported that the amount of time it took for the police, ambulance, and/or helicopter to arrive at the scene of the accident or event was very positive.\nIndividuals with TBI were unconscious during this time period and all were in a coma for varying amounts of time. Barriers noted with emergency care in the rural communities included the lack of neurologists on call, an inadequate knowledge base among practitioners, and participants' distrust in the local healthcare systems.

It\u2026numbed me but then I had so much faith, I told them he wasn't going to die\u2026\u2025 Ella, Clay's mother An additional challenge during the acute care phase was not having a place for family members to stay, since the hospital was far from their rural homes. Caregivers adapted in various ways, such as sleeping in stairwells or in uncomfortable chairs in waiting rooms. Caregivers had to adjust to living with only the essentials, and many had to miss work in order to be by their loved one's side. Murphy described the importance of family support:\nMy parents stayed with me\u2026 That's been a huge blessing\u2026\u2025the entire time I was in the hospital, my parents were only not with me for one day.\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nThree people with TBI transitioned from acute care to other locations such as a skilled nursing facility (SNF) or long term acute care hospital. Clay was transferred to a SNF, and Clay's caregiver believed he did not receive the care he needed.\nYeah, they shipped him back down here to a nursing home instead of shipping him to (the regional IRF in urban area)\u2026. (Things were) completely out of control\u2026 they would just leave him lying there in bed (in the SNF). \u2026.Where he's so young and everybody there was older and it didn't make me feel comfortable him being in the nursing home\u2026 so I just told him, I said, this ain't a place for my son, I'm bringing him home. So I had them to order me the stuff and set it up and then I brought him home and kept him with me\u2026\u2025 So I set up that thing here (referring to the hospital bed in her living room).\nElla, Clay's mother Brandon's mother felt that Brandon did not receive the proper care at an urban long term acute care hospital (two hours from their home). She indicated that the intravenous equipment was not well managed, and described how Brandon became dehydrated and malnourished during his stay there. He developed pressure ulcers, and she was told they would not be able to heal. Her belief was reinforced later by the fact that once she brought Brandon home, he gained weight and the pressure ulcers healed.\nThere were some misunderstandings about their equipment and the feeding, the tube feeding \u2026. I don't think he was getting enough\u2026. the dietitian didn't really seem to be much of an advocate for him. I would notice some of the nurses weren't doing it [tube feeding] that way (the way she was trained). So I actually said, isn't this what's supposed to be happening. So I was catching things\u2026. Having an advocate for these people is key. You have nurses and then you change to another nurse and the shifts (change)\u2026 It is terrible for somebody in this situation\u2026.

Some still depended on caregivers for their daily function. Many were able to manage their own daily needs but were not able to return to meaningful activities. A few participants were involved in volunteer positions in the community. Three participants had participated in vocational rehabilitation support, but two of them had to relocate to university environments to do so, and the third felt she was humiliated in a day care/day work program and stopped participating. Participants described chronic symptoms and physical limitations that continue to affect their ability to be productive on a day to day basis even years after the initial injury.

Traumatic brain injury resulted in continuing challenges across the care continuum for both the individual with TBI and the caregiver, especially upon returning to their communities. Living in a rural area accentuated those challenges. Similar to the findings from Levack and colleagues [27] , the people with TBI in rural Kentucky did not return to functional activities and relationships that were key to their identities prior to the injury. We found this to be true of the caregivers as well.\nConsistent with the findings of other studies [17, 40, 41, 43] most of our participants had been re-hospitalized due to a variety of medical problems, and lacked meaningful activity in which to participate on a daily basis. Also consistent with previous findings were the lack of emotional support and the recurring fatigue of the caregivers [4, 12, 26, 35] . This current study expanded our understanding by providing in-depth accounts of perspectives that represented the experiences of the individuals at each locus of care across the continuum. Even when resources such as financial support and vocational rehabilitation were available, a lack of linkages to those resources left the individuals and caregivers isolated in their rural communities.\nCommunity integration has been defined in the literature in various ways, but all definitions emphasize that it is multi-dimensional in nature and consists of at least the components of relationships, independence in one's living situation, and meaningful activity [38, 51] . These themes mirror those that emerged in our study, which were the critical role of relationships, the development of functional competence, and the challenges of finding daily meaningful activity in which to participate.\nThe most persistent theme was the importance of relationships and communication across the care continuum. In the early stages of emergency and acute care, communication with hospital staff is the only link to stability in an otherwise overwhelming situation. We suggest that the chaos and fear generated by communicating with multiple providers could be quelled in part by one person in the acute care setting being assigned to provide a trusting relationship and linkages among health care staff, and the person with TBI and caregivers.\nRelationships with committed caregivers were lifelines for people with TBI across the continuum. Caregivers traveled to urban hospitals and IRFs resulting in many logistical challenges related to transportation, housing, and interference with employment. The availability and coordination of adequate sleeping arrangements for caregivers would substantially improve the challenges which are inevitable in a rural state such as Kentucky. Upon finally returning home, participants were often met with frustrations because of the eventual decline of relationships within the community. In some cases, connections with friends, family, and faith community eased the initial transition, but over time and in all cases, relationships waned, and most participants felt isolated at the time of their interview. Further, most caregivers did not develop trusting relationships with local health care providers. Communication between previous IRF professionals and local rural professionals appeared to be minimal, and linkages with existing community resources were not faciliated for the transition home. This is consistent with the study by Bellon and colleagues [4] which identified the need for coordinated and accessible services as the top need expressed by those with ABI living in rural regions. A local community health worker who is trained to bridge the gap between the individual and family, and their community, could help with the important linkages families need upon returning home.\nThe second theme, the development of functional competence, emerged primarily after leaving acute care. There was considerable praise from participants for the staff in the urban IRF who supported individuals in the development of physical functional abilities. Participants who experienced care in a SNF or a long term acute care facility declined in terms of health and function. This highlighted the need to improve training and staffing in SNFs and long term acute care environments, or otherwise ensure that people with TBI are referred to the acute IRF. Lewis and Horn [28] found intensive rehabilitative services provided in a continuum after acute care for people with ABI (including neurorehabilitation, day treatment, and supported living) were effective in improving key areas such as self care, the ability to initiate activities, and the ability to self monitor. Positive changes in these key areas were strong predictors of reduced disability in this group [28] and positive change was seen in people who received intensive services as far out from injury as seven years. This helps dispel the myth that rehabilitation after the first year from injury is futile. Unfortunately other research indicated that many people never receive or receive too little rehabilitation after TBI [18, 29, 32] . Our observations were that after acute inpatient rehabilitation, intensive rehabilitative services were uncommon, particularly after the first year from injury.\nThe transition to home was a critical time for all participants and most experienced substantial obstacles to functional competence. Solovieva and Martin [46] and Bellon [4] demonstrated that knowledge of available resources and ability to access them remain substantial challenges for those with TBI living in rural areas, and this was true for our participants. They had recurring health problems and settled for a vulnerable homeostasis, often employing coping mechanisms that helped in the short term but contributed to long term problems. Caregivers also felt ill prepared and exhausted by the time of this transition. Education for caregivers was not adequate in most cases to result in the transfer of functional skills learned in the IRF or SNF to the home environment. The physical adaptations of the house and the mountainous land presented challenges, and there was very little money or expertise to make needed adaptations. Transportation was a challenge.\nTwo key resources available in Kentucky for people with TBI are Medicaid waiver monies and the Kentucky Traumatic Brain Injury Trust Fund. Medicaid is the federal health insurance program in the US for people requiring financial assistance. Medicaid waiver programs have been established in many states, including Kentucky, to permit Medicaid money for support services to a limited number of people in need, including those with TBI [1] . The Kentucky Traumatic Brain Injury Trust Fund was established through a tax on fines for Driving Under the Influence charges, and limited resources can be accessed through this source as well [45] . While the programs have limitations, they can be quite beneficial to people with TBI. It is disturbing that only one person in our study indicated utilization of these resources. Most participants with TBI had little meaningful activity in which to participate. The Office of Vocational Rehabilitation (OVR) is charged with helping people with disabilities find employment [19] . The full services of OVR had only been accessed by the two individuals who were pursuing graduate degrees. This may be an area to explore in the future to better connect the appropriate TBI population with this program.\nAccording to one systematic review, there was limited but consistent evidence that case management improved linkages to community services, vocational outcome, and life satisfaction for people with TBI [24] . Researchers examining case management services for people with TBI reported positive outcomes in functional competence, independence, and social networking [8, 30] . Baptiste and colleagues [2] summarized the research supporting the effectiveness of case management in life care planning for those with TBI, and found that people with TBI who live in institutional settings or group homes are more likely to use case management services than those who live alone. The participants in this study were relatively isolated and lived in rural areas where case management services appeared unaccessible or unavailable.\nEspinosa [16] demonstrated the fiscal effectiveness and the improvement in quality of life for people with varying diagnoses, including TBI, who received case management services in Kentucky. Researchers have also demonstrated the positive outcomes of telephone follow up by case managers with veterans with service related TBIs living at home [30] . The use of telecommunications for case management follow up for people in rural Kentucky is a model worth exploring.\nWe propose the expansion of professional case management resources for people with TBI, with contact occurring as soon as possible after the injury and continuing across the care environments. While this type of system is available in some countries (e.g. [2, 8, 24] and in some urban areas in the United States (e.g. [28] , it is missing in rural regions, likely due in part to the challenges inherent in linking professional case managers to patients in rural areas. One approach to address this issue is to have the professional case management services be made available during the acute and subacute phases, with a transition to a community health worker (i.e lay health navigator) who lives in the rural region to which the individual is returning. The efficacy of using local health navigators has been and is continuing to be explored in the area of cancer care and stroke, with positive outcomes for reduced hospitalization and improved health outcomes [14, 34] . Such a lay health navigator/ community worker does not necessarily need to be a health care professional but rather a person with adequate training about the needs of people with TBI and a broad understanding of available local resources. The professional case manager could provide leadership and support to the local health navigator (and the clients), as needed, through the use of telecommuncations. Furthermore, the local health navigator could provide linkages among those in the region with TBI, and caregivers, faciliating a peer support network which has been shown to be helpful in providing emotional and informational support [4] . We hypothesize that such an expansion relying on professional case management in the early stages of care and trained lay health navigators in later stages would reduce costs in the long run and contribute to the well-being of people with TBI and their caregivers."}, {"section_title": "Study Limitations", "text": "This study was designed to provide in-depth information about the lives of people with TBI and their caregivers, living in rural Kentucky. As such it was limited to a small sample size in one predominately rural state in the United States. Generalizations to people with TBI in other rural areas of the country should be made with caution. In addition, interviews with the caregiver were sometimes completed in the presence of the person with TBI or another family member, and this may have influenced their responses. While we cannot be sure of what type of differences may have occurred due to interviewing some dyads, the perception of the interviewers was that the participants were extremely forthcoming. For people who were interviewed as dyads, there was more of a likelihood that those people with TBI had more severe injuries. By having their caregiver take part with them they were provided support and helped to express their own views. There was a likely a sampling bias because the people who responded to the flyer were those who were motivated to tell their story and/or had a caregiver with similar motivation. Future studies should focus on people in rural areas of other states and countries, to determine if the narratives are similar, especially in countries with differing systems of health care provision."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "This study provided detailed perspectives on the barriers and facilitators of optimal functioning across the care continuum from rural Kentuckians with TBI and caregivers. Their experiences in survival were fraught with unpredictable outcomes due in part to the continuing changes over time. Caregivers faced unique challenges. Unmet needs were most pervasive when participants were adapting to life in their rural communities. We propose that case managers who understand needs specific to people with TBI and caregivers could provide service coordination early and across the continuum, and trained community health workers who live within the local community might be able to extend that case management support when the individual returns home. This would hopefully provide trusted relationships throughout the continuum of care and improve linkages to services that facilitate continued development of functional competence upon returning home. Additional research to examine the efficacy of case management and community health worker support for people with TBI living in rural areas is warranted. We observed a remarkably hopeful outlook in many caregivers and people with TBI, suggesting a foundation for constructive use of resources and supports, if available and accessible."}, {"section_title": "8.", "text": "What is the hardest thing and the best thing about living in your community in terms of the TBI?"}, {"section_title": "9.", "text": "Do you feel your family members (or extended family or other caregivers) were prepared to help you?"}, {"section_title": "10.", "text": "( "}, {"section_title": "Counties of residence of participants interviewed", "text": ""}]
