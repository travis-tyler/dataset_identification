All cognitively intact subjects with area 19 NFTs also had dense core NP and A amyloid (AA) angiopathy in area 19. Area 19 pathology was occasionally present in the absence of substantial pathology in the hippocampus or entorhinal cortex and was not correlated with medial temporal lobe pathology.

There is substantial evidence that the pathologic lesions of AD develop years, or even decades, before the clinical detection of cognitive decline. Indeed, it is customary to find some degree of AD pathology in the brains of elderly cognitively normal individuals (1Y 8), but the density and distribution of the lesions are usually not severe enough to qualify as AD according to accepted guidelines (9) . Nondemented individuals who are found at autopsy to have histologic lesions of AD, insufficient in severity for the pathologic diagnosis of AD, have been regarded as having Bpreclinical AD^ (1, 4, 5, 8) .\nThe widely accepted view of the pathologic progression of AD lesions is based on the Braaks' review of 83 brains from demented and nondemented subjects ranging in age from 47 to 96 years (mean, 73 years) (10) . In the mildest forms of amyloid deposition, there are low densities of diffuse plaques (DPs) and NPs distributed throughout the frontal, temporal, and occipital neocortex, including prominent deposits in the peristriate or visual association area, Brodmann area (BA) 19 (10) . Recent studies with the amyloid-imaging tracer [ 11 C] Pittsburgh Compound-B (PIB) in elderly nondemented individuals substantiate this pattern of amyloid deposition (11, 12) . With increasing amyloid burden, almost all neocortical areas are affected as well as the medial temporal structures, subcortical and brainstem nuclei (13) . Neurofibrillary pathology, including NFTs and neuropil threads (NTs), begins in the medial temporal lobe and expands with increasing severity to involve the inferior, then superior, temporal cortex, and eventually other neocortical areas, including peristriate cortex, in the more advanced stages of disease (10) .\nImaging studies in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild AD have shown a different progression of regional abnormalities. Studies using single photon emission computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging have found initial changes in blood flow, metabolic deficits, and activation latencies localized to the posterior brain regions, including posterior temporoparietal and occipital cortices (12, 14 Y 22) . Additional clinical reports have suggested that posterior cortical areas subserving visual processing are affected early in the course of AD, because abnormalities in visuospatial motion detection and visual memory have been frequently reported in MCI and AD (23 Y 29) .\nWith this seeming disparity among pathologic, radiographic, and clinical observations in mind, we evaluated the regional distribution of AD pathology in 9 cortical brain regions in 41 elderly participants from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) who were judged clinically to be cognitively normal, mildly cognitively impaired with an amnestic component, or demented on the basis of AD. The brain regions examined encompassed the medial temporal lobe structures of the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala, as well as traditional areas of neocortex examined in the CERAD protocol (30) and 3 posterior regions of the neocortex, calcarine cortex, BA 17, and visual association areas, BA 18 and BA 19."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Subjects selected for analysis were brain donors from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) cohorts who died between January 1996 and January 2003, who were considered cognitively intact, mildly cognitively impaired with an amnestic component, or demented on the basis of a clinical diagnosis of probable AD at the time of death."}, {"section_title": "Clinical Assessment", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Clinical Dementia Rating", "text": "Cognitive status was determined during life using biennial Mini-Mental Status Examinations.

After death, a team consisting of at least one neurologist and one neuropsychologist anchored a review committee that determined the clinical dementia status for all brain donation participants. Death review included assignment of a retrospective Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score using the Initial Subject Protocol (ISP), which is the revised Retrospective Collateral Dementia Interview (RCDI) from the Washington University Alzheimer`s Disease Research Center (ADRC) (31, 32) . The ISP/RCDI is a telephone interview conducted with a family member or caregiver to obtain information from the last known clinical assessment to the time of death. The validity of the RCDI has been described elsewhere (31) . The review process incorporated all data from Framingham neuropsychologic assessments as well as results from FHS health status examinations, neurologic evaluations, and a telephone interview with a family member, typically the spouse or an adult child. A CDR for the individual was generated using the guidelines established by the Washington University ADRC. No information regarding the neuropathologic findings was available at any time during the clinical review process.\nSubjects were categorized as cognitively intact (CDR 0), mildly cognitively impaired (CDR 0.5), or demented (CDR 1 Y3). All cases with mild cognitive impairment had a substantial memory component. All demented cases were clinically diagnosed as probable AD. A separate and independent review committee reviewed all subjects for the presence of cognitive impairment and documented evidence of clinical stroke. Subjects considered to have cognitive impairment or dementia resulting from a clinical stroke were not included in the analysis. Family interviews were given to corroborate and elaborate cognitive history.\nClinical diagnosis of dementia met criteria specified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (33) .

These focal accumulations of NFTs, NTs, and tauimmunoreactive NPs were often greatest in at the depths of sulci and, in mildly affected cases, formed isolated clusters. In BA 19, abundant NFTs, NTs, and tau-immunoreactive NPs were found in layer II as well as layers III and V (Figs. 2  and 3 ). The density of NFT in BA 19 far exceeded the NFT density in the other neocortical areas examined, including superior temporal cortex.\nAlthough the neurofibrillary pathology in area 19 was focally intense compared with adjacent regions, the density of NPs was not similarly focal and NPs were more uniformly and widely distributed throughout BA 19 ( Fig. 1) . NPs in area 19 included many compacted, dense core NPs, which were remarkable in their predilection for the perimeter and vascular wall of small blood vessels (Fig. 4) . On the whole, cognitively intact subjects with area 19 neurofibrillary pathology had significantly higher overall NPs (Wilcoxon nonparametric rank sum, p G 0.0001), higher overall DP (p = 0.004), and higher NPs in area 19 (p G 0.0001) compared with cognitively intact subjects without area 19 NFTs.

In the mildly impaired subjects, the regional pathology in visual association cortex area 19 involved much greater expanses of brain (Figs. 1  and 3 ), focal clusters of pathology were not as evident, and the pathologic lesions contained dense NFTs, NTs, and tauimmunoreactive NPs (Figs. 1 and 3 )."}, {"section_title": "Cognitively Impaired Subjects", "text": "In the CDR 1 Y3 AD subjects, neurofibrillary pathology was consistently found in BA 19, becoming more widespread with greater severity of AD.

This pronounced degeneration of visual association cortex, BA 19, was also found in all subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer dementia. NFTs in this region were frequently found in isolated clusters, often near the depths of sulci, affecting cortical layers II, III, and V. Furthermore, area 19 neurofibrillary pathology was always associated with prominent dense core NPs and amyloid angiopathy. Analysis of cognitively intact subjects with very little AA deposition, yet focal area 19 pathology showed NPs and vascular AA restricted to the posterior regions of cortex, particularly BA 19. Area 19 neurofibrillary pathology was associated with significantly higher overall densities of NPs, DPs, vascular amyloid, and NFTs, but not with MTL NFTs or MTL NPs.\nThe involvement of posterior cortical regions in MCI and mild AD is consistent with single photon emission computed tomography, positron emission tomography with 18 fluorodeoxyglucose and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies (12, 14 Y 22) showing abnormalities in posterior brain regions, including the posterior temporoparietal and occipital regions serving object and spatial vision (42) . Nondemented elderly subjects show a higher rate of occipital gray matter atrophy compared with other brain regions using high-resolution MRI scans (43) . Nondemented adults with Down syndrome show significant gray matter losses in occipital cortex, specifically the left lingual gyrus, which includes BA 19, by MRI with voxel-based morphometry (44) . Similarly, reliable age-related changes during visual processing have been found using regional cerebral blood flow measurements (45) . Older subjects showed increased reaction times and more widespread prefrontal activation during location matching. These findings indicate reduced occipital cortex processing efficiency and greater disturbance of spatial vision compared to object vision by aging (45) .\nThese results are also in agreement with the recently observed impaired visual motion processing in individuals with MCI, AD, and in older cognitively intact individuals (23 Y 25) . Duffy et al found 20% of their normal elderly, 33% of their MCI subjects and 50% of their AD subjects had abnormalities in visuospatial orientation, despite a mean age 10 years younger (72.5 years) than that of FHS participants (84.1 years) (23) .\nAs further evidence of involvement of the visual association cortex in cognitively normal elderly, abnormalities in visual memory have been reported in 2 normative aging studies. Both the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging and the Personnes Agees quid (PAQUID) study found that poor performance on tests of visual memory in normal elderly subjects was associated with an increased risk of AD as many as 10 to 15 years later (26 Y 29) . FHS studies have also shown poor performance on formal neuropsychologic examination decades before the diagnosis of AD (2, 46) . These longitudinal studies support the concept that AD is a chronic process beginning many years before the clinical expression of dementia and that abnormalities in visual motion processing and visual memory in otherwise intact elderly individuals may indicate substantial AD pathology in a vulnerable cortical region such as high-order visual association cortex.\nIt is well recognized that the visual association cortex is affected in AD (10, 47 Y 49) and clinically complex visual disturbances have been described (50, 51) . Nevertheless, the traditionally held view was that visual association regions were not prominently involved until late in the course of the disease or were affected early only in the posterior or visuospatial variant of AD. Indeed, in the Braak staging scheme of NFTs, severe alteration of the peristriate or highorder visual association cortex is considered incompatible with the early, transentorhinal, and limbic stages of AD. Most histopathologic studies of AD routinely omit analysis of the occipital cortex or limit the examination to primary visual cortex, BA 17. In the widely used CERAD protocol for the diagnosis of AD (30) that has been incorporated into the most recent diagnostic recommendations, the NIAReagan criteria (9) , the occipital cortex is not examined.\nWhy peristriate cortex is particularly vulnerable to early neurofibrillary and NP pathology is not entirely clear. The area is predisposed to early and intense AA deposits with aging (10, 11), as we found in our cognitively intact subjects. We also found that all subjects with BA 19 NFTs had small dense core NPs in this area, typically situated on the wall and perimeter of small blood vessels. Furthermore, we found that vascular amyloid in area 19 was always present in subjects with area 19 NFTs, and in 2 subjects, vascular amyloid was only found in area 19. The fact that cases with mild AA deposition showed dense core AA NPs and vascular amyloid restricted to this neocortical region suggests that this region is an early site of AA accumulation, despite the limitations of a cross-sectional autopsy analysis. Buckner and colleagues have reported a remarkable correlation between default brain activity patterns in young adults and amyloid deposition in elderly individuals, and suggest that activity and metabolism patterns in youth may be conducive to amyloid deposition in aging (12) . Default mode activity measured by [ 15 O]H 2 0 PET shows especially high activity in the occipital cortices (12) . Vasocentric dense core AA NPs have been described in the Flemish variant of AD, a variant associated with high levels of AA 40, and 2 transgenic mouse models of AD, Tg2576 and PSAPP. In the transgenic mouse models, dense core NPs are associated with ultrastructural microvascular abnormalities and altered vascular permeability to serum proteins (52, 53) .\nArea 19 is located in a boundary territory between the most posterior reaches of the 3 major cerebral arteries: the anterior cerebral artery, middle cerebral artery, and posterior cerebral artery (54, 55) . Although all boundary territories are vulnerable to hypoperfusion and ischemic injuries, including microinfarcts, the area around the parieto-occipital sulcus, which includes area 19, is the most vulnerable because it is the most remote from the origin of each artery (54 Y 56). Border zone microinfarcts have been reported to occur in 32.4% of AD subjects compared with 2.5% of age-matched controls (55) . Conceivably, the combination of focal ischemia as a result of low perfusion and AA angiopathy may promote the formation of perivascular dense core NPs consequent to decreased perivascular clearance (57) . Perhaps too, focal vascular insufficiency, aggravated by leakage of serum proteins into the area, promotes the formation of the NFTs, NTs, and tau-immunoreactive neurites around NPs. The concurrence of focal clusters of NFTs, NTs, tauimmunoreactive neurites around NPs, perivascular dense core NPs, AA angiopathy, and the predilection of this borderzone region for microinfarcts and cerebral hypoperfusion may not be entirely coincidental.\nThe synaptic complexity of the region, which is highly adaptive and structurally dynamic (58), may be an additional factor in early vulnerability to degenerative change. Cortical areas involved in secondary associative processing such as auditory association and sensory association areas are more vulnerable to AD pathology than primary processing areas such as primary sensory and motor cortex (59) . High-order visual association cortex involves specialized integration of multisynaptic corticocortical inputs (42) , and this synaptic complexity may amplify regional susceptibility to metabolic, oxidative, and ischemic stress.\nNFTs are found more superficially in area 19 than in other neocortical areas; abundant NFTs are found in layer II as well as the typically affected layers III and V. The laminar distribution of NFT formation in this peristriate cortex reflects the distinctive cortical organization of this region, which is characterized by a relative paucity of large neurons, a relatively thick layer II, and evenly distributed cell density throughout all the cortical layers (37) .\nOur data provide further evidence that neurofibrillary pathology in the MTL occurs in the absence of AA deposition, as has been described and commented on by others (10, 12, 39, 60) . In contrast, neurofibrillary pathology in the visual association cortex, BA 19, occurs only in the presence of AA, both as dense core NPs and as vascular amyloid, and is not correlated with neurofibrillary or AA pathology in the MTL. Accordingly, it seems less likely that these posterior cortical lesions are secondary consequences to MTL pathology and more probable that these changes are the result of specific metabolic, anatomic, connectional, synaptic, or vascular factors distinct to this region.\nThe chief limitations of this study are that it is a crosssectional autopsy analysis, that patterns of amyloid deposition may be dynamic, and that cases with the mildest amount of AA deposition may not be representative of the earliest amyloid deposition. The same may be true for neurofibrillary pathology, although the less soluble nature of the paired helical filaments that constitute NFTs suggests that the lesions are longstanding. In addition, previous imaging studies suggest that the occipital atrophy is more pronounced in the left hemisphere (44, 45) , and we examined a randomized distribution of a single hemisphere; bilateral analysis might have yielded additional pathology.\nAmong elderly subjects in the Framingham study, clinically followed for 29 to 50 years, NFTs, NTs, and tauimmunoreactive NPs are commonly found in high-order visual association cortex, even in cognitively normal individuals. Whether intact individuals with abundant pathology in visual area 19 will also have abnormalities in visual motion processing or visual memory remains to be determined. If so, a unique tool will exist for identifying elderly normal individuals on the brink of clinically detectable cognitive decline, a technique that may prove valuable in selecting persons for therapeutic intervention and experimental drug trials."}]
