Therefore, the increasing rate of cumulative cases (IRCC/day) is proposed as an index with a practical meaning as the isolation rate. First in this work, the analyzing method and database used in the previous report are briefly reviewed. Then normalizing coefficient C is introduced to correlate isolation rate q and IRCC as q=C\u2022IRCC. Further, C is formulated in two modes, one is simple and the other complex, under the constraint conditions by definition of 0\u2264x, q\u22641, which give allowable narrow path of C during infection period between upper and lower boundaries of C. Then, the dynamic locus of q-x relation is analyzed for each of seven countries including Japan and the United States using formulated isolation rate q, and characteristic q-x behavior of each country is derived. At the same time, it is shown that specific path selection of C gives almost same loci of linear q-x relation derived mathematically in the previous report. In addition, increasing rates of cumulative PCR tests, IRCT, for six countries are discussed in relation with IRCC, and are shown that IRCT contributes to the promotion of the isolation rate via IRCC."}, {"section_title": "Basic equation in SIQR model and approaching method in data-fitting", "text": "The same analyzing method as previous analyses was taken, the important items of which are reviewed briefly in the following. \u30fbBasic equation; The number of daily isolated persons (tested as positive and maybe isolated, hereafter new cases) \u0394Q is expressed by logarithmic approximation formula (1) with constant term , and \u03bb value was obtained as a coefficient of linear regression.

Additionally, the epidemic process is regarded as same even though the possibility of genetically different viruses. \u30fbAnalytical procedure; Both the social distancing ratio x and the isolation rate q in eq. (2) are parameters that take values of 0 to 1 based on their definitions. When both are 0, that is, without any measures to suppress infection, the right side of eq. (2) becomes \u03b2N \u2212\u03b3, which gives the maximum value \u03bbmax (= \u03b2N\u2212\u03b3), and the number of new cases increases at the fastest speed. This relationship is substituted into eq. (2) and transformed to obtain eq. (3).\n\u03b2N associated with the maximum \u03bb is considered as constant throughout the infection period.\nUsing the right-hand side \u2206\u03bb of eq.

There was no consideration of isolation rate from a practical and physical point of view in those analyses, therefore it is necessary to explore the physical basis of isolation rate based on the practical index for practical application of SIQR model.\nThe isolation rate q defined in eq. (2) is the index representing the rate of isolation from the group of infected but unquarantined patients, which directly corresponds to the daily new cases.\nConsidering two requirements for q, as of 0\u2264 q\u22641 and the unit of (1/day), the increasing rate of daily new cases is not suitable because it can be positive or negative depending on the daily increase or decrease. Remaining candidate for isolation rate is the number of new cases per day, which is always 0 or more. However, this number fluctuates largely depending on the method of data tabulation even after a moving average. Therefore, the increasing rate of the cumulative cases (IRCC) calculated as a daily slope of the cumulative cases curve, is used as a candidate for isolation rate.\nIRCC is more suitable than the number of new cases per day for the purpose of capturing the overall trend with less fluctuation through a leveling effect by regression.\nIRCC is regression analyzed as the daily slope of the cumulative cases curve, and is shown in Figs. 1a and b. The start, peak and convergence days are shown as dots in the figure, and the days at maximum increasing rate are located close to the peak days. IRCC is assumed to be proportional to the isolation rate q.\nUnder this assumption, the isolation rate increases rapidly in all countries from the start day of maximum value \u03bbmax, when q is zero, and the maximum isolation rate is recorded near the peak day.
