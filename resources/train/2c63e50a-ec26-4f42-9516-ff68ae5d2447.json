[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "There are several large child development birth cohort studies that obtain the benefit of a cohort that is a census or is chosen randomly from a defined geographic area. These include the National Child Development Study and the British Cohort Study, the Millennium Cohort Study, and The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study: \u2022 The National Child Development Study (NCDS) is a continuing, multi-disciplinary longitudinal study which takes as its subjects all the people born in England, Scotland  The above studies all began surveillance at the time of birth. The National Children's Study (NCS) is unique in that it is a random sample of women and their offspring, with data collection beginning early in or prior to pregnancy and continuing with follow-up through 21 years of life with structured prospective data collection. This is a necessary list of ingredients for an unselected sample and assessment of the impact of the environment in utero and postnatally, unfettered by recall bias or other issued involved in retrospective examination of environmental data and outcome data. There may be a segment in the research community that believes that observational studies, lacking the control of an experimental protocol cannot rise to the scientific level of an experimental study such as a clinical trial. The dichotomy between a controlled experiment and an observational study has generally reflected their different objectives: hypothesis generation versus hypothesis testing (see also Michael RT et al. [4] ). Some might argue that this dichotomy is one of lower and higher quality. Biostatisticians often hear complaints from their non-statistical colleagues embarking on an observational study that since their study is not a clinical trial, it does not have to meet the scientific demands of a clinical trial. I argue on the contrary, that because of the lack of ability to control major design factors and glean the benefits of balance for those not controlled though randomization, observational studies must require a strict adherence to a sharp set of design criteria to make sure that as much variation and bias as possible is eliminated in the observed data. The National Children's Study has been designed with the goal of valid and generalizable inference, and the decision to use a national probability sample is as crucial as randomization is to a clinical trial in efforts to raise the scientific bar to its highest possible level in achieving this goal with this massive and long term effort. Of course, there are myriad other design issues to be addressed, many of which can undermine the validity of inferences. These include but are not limited to: development of clear protocol definitions and procedures, development of quality assurance techniques to create uniform data collection at geographically disparate and heterogeneous data collection centers and homes throughout the US. And related specifically to the inferential base, attention to the enrollment of those randomly chosen to participate and for those that choose to participate, attention to the retention of these participants. My goal in this paper is to demonstrate the importance of avoiding selection bias through random selection of the NCS cohort and equally important, to protect that inferential base by the minimization of patient attrition."}, {"section_title": "USE OF A NATIONAL PROBABILITY RANDOM SAMPLE FOR THE NCS INSTEAD OF A CENTER BASED APPROACH TO COHORT SELECTION", "text": "Many prospective medical cohort studies recruit or have recruited potential participants from those entering through the portals of existing major medical centers. I distinguish here between the use of medical centers or other medical care portals for enrollment and the use of centers for the implementation of a cohort study. The NINDS Collaborative Perinatal Project (NCPP), for example, the predecessor study of the NCS, recruited approximately 60,000 gravidae from 15 university-affiliated centers, with eight year follow-up of their offspring. The participants were chosen from those seeking obstetric care at the hospital clinics from 1959-1965 [5]. The cohort recruited was about 46% White and 46% Black, with \"other\" for the remainder, not representative of the race/ethnic makeup of the US at that time. Study income of study participants was lower than their respective state levels for Whites and higher than their state levels for Blacks. Thus not only was the NCPP not a random sample or even a sample from a well defined catchment area, for both race/ethnicity and income levels, the participants in the study population were not representative of either their state of residence or the US. Are the results of the NCPP then valid and generalizable? From one major standpoint, the NCPP did provide an unselected sample-with respect to cohorts of children with specific outcomes. Children with cerebral palsy or epilepsy or autism were not selected into the cohort because of the severity of their disorder, or because of their ability to obtain health care, therefore they represented all children with each disorder born into the cohort developed from the NCPP center sampling approach. This is a non trivial design benefit, and the scientists working on the NCPP have produced a plethora of useful and sometimes groundbreaking results that have since been replicated [6,7]. Unfortunately, there is no empirical scorecard for the NCPP indicating which results have been replicated and stood the test of time. The scientific rationale for use of a national probability sample is twofold: (1) to produce results that are at low risk of being impacted by unknown and unmeasurable selection bias; and (2) to produce results that are generalizable to the US population. Some associations generated from an observational study might be so profound, and/or insensitive to changes in underlying mechanisms, that they would emerge despite any surrounding noise or bias. However, in human research, such robust truths are quite rare. A simple contrived example from the NCPP demonstrates how researchers can be led astray in assessing associations in the presence of selection bias that is unknown or unquantifiable. Table 1, data from the NCPP [8] on the association between race and birthweight in the development of cerebral palsy (CP)."}, {"section_title": "Consider in", "text": "These data indicate first, that black children have a higher observed incidence of CP than whites (0.49% vs. 0.36% and second that that low birth weight children (\u2264 2500 grams) have a much higher relative risk (RR) of CP in black children than in white children (RR = 7.2 vs 3.9, respectively). As noted above, the racial distribution of the pregnant women in the NCPP was dramatically out of line with that of the US. Making some bold assumptions, what if we adjusted the cohort to more appropriately reflect the US population? Using simple multiplication of each of the cell elements for whites and blacks separately, we can develop a table with the same risk structure, but having 89% Whites and 11% Blacks. All of the relative ratios for the races would stay the same, but the TOTAL cohort RR would decrease from 4.92 to 4.02, reflecting the shift of the cohort makeup from 50/50 to the more realistic 89% White. Theoretically then, we could back adjust the original estimate of RR = 4.92 for the TOTAL cohort to a more reasonable RR = 4.02 to account for the maldistribution of the cohort. Since no investigator with knowledge of the subject matter at hand would produce an estimate of the impact of low birthweight unstratified by race, this exercise might appear unenlightening. However, with a simple shift the potential for selection bias to influence empirical outcome associations in an observed cohort becomes clear if the reader replaces the title \"RACE\" in Table 1 with \"UNKNOWN OR UNIDENTIFIED FACTOR\". In this transformed scenario, all the investigator observes is the TOTAL cohort. An unknown mechanism of selection bias is determining the composition of the TOTAL cohort with regard to this unknown factor and the investigator does not know its structure (as we did in the example) and cannot know how to adjust for such bias. I indicated earlier that the whites in this cohort had higher and the blacks lower incomes than their racial counter parts in their respective states. Thus even if one could manipulate the data to account for the race factor, there would still be an unknown influence of the income disparities on the observed results. With selection bias, the investigator may think she/he can identify and quantify some aspects of why participants choose not to participate or choose not to remain on study, but as later examples will indicate, this is generally not the case. We simply are not omniscient. There are many ways that selection bias can slip into the equation, several major causes should be ameliorated if not eliminated using a national random household probability sample. In the sampling plan for the NCS, there is no prerequisite for access to health care as there might be in an enrollment plan that used clinical centers for the point of entry. Many factors such as financial and social status, influence access to and choice of healthcare providers, and these factors are relevant to childhood health outcomes. In the sampling plan for the NCS, all households randomly chosen are approached to screen for potential participants, there being no reliance on arbitrary contact points that might lead to selective cohort participants (e.g. physician office source). The sampling plan for the NCS should eliminate the selection bias that can destroy inferential validity. In the next section I present an example in which selection bias unfortunately misdirected scientists for decades leading to major clinical ramifications"}, {"section_title": "SELECTION BIAS AND THE MANAGEMENT OF CHILDREN WITH FEBRILE SEIZURES", "text": "A febrile seizure is a convulsion that occurs with fever in children up to about 5 years of age. Prevalence, has been estimated at about 2-5% [9], throughout the 1970s and 1980s in the U.S. implies that each year approximately 175,000 children experienced a febrile seizure. The seizures are quite scary to parents and the sequelae of primary concern have included repeated febrile seizures, seizures without fever (e.g. non febrile seizure or epilepsy) and mental retardation. The management of febrile seizures during the 1970's was based on the risks known at that time to have been associated with febrile seizures compared to the benefits and risks associated with various forms of management. The available forms of management at that time were basically antipyretic approaches, with medication at the start of a cold or at the time of the start of a fever, or use of luke warm baths when fever got high. Neuroactive medications were also recommended and used frequently to prevent either additional febrile seizures or to lower the perceived risk of non febrile seizures, or simply to assuage parents' fears. [10] Summarizing a great deal of literature at that time concisely: risk of progression of febrile seizures to recurrent febrile and then non febrile seizures was thought to be known and high; and intervention to prevent such progression was thought to be efficacious and relatively risk free [11]. While the phrase \"evidence based medicine\" was not yet coined in the 70's, then as now, the usefulness of evidence based medicine was only as good as the evidence. For example, in contrast to the consensus then that antipyretics were efficacious, recent evidence about the efficacy of antipyretic (Bauman [12] and Shinnar and Glauser [13]) has proven that they are not effective, thus overturning the medical presumptions that guided clinical practice throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Table 2 outlines the medical knowledge in the late 1970's with regard to the efficacy of management strategies for the two febrile seizure sequelae of concern at the time. The object lesson here comes down to the post Watergate use of the phrase \"what did you know and when did you know it?\" and a quote attributed to Will Rogers \"\u2026 it isn't what we don't know that gives us trouble, it's what we know that ain't so.\" In the 70's the evidence based medicine approach failed because the literature presented a body of evidence that led physicians to believe that they knew but what they knew just wasn't correct. I will next discuss how the assumed risks of sequelae of febrile seizures were based on evidence flawed by selection bias, which led to the corresponding flawed medical strategy of the 1970s. The story illustrates why the sampling strategy of the National Children's Study -a national probability sample -is such and important and proper strategy."}, {"section_title": "SEQUELAE OF FEBRILE SEIZURES", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Risk of febrile seizure recurrence", "text": "Based on the literature available in the 1970s, approximately one in three children who had experienced one febrile seizure experienced a second febrile seizure [14,15,16]. A more recent study indicates about the same expectation [17]. Thus medical knowledge of recurrence of febrile seizures has remained stable over the past several decades."}, {"section_title": "Risk of nonfebrile seizures", "text": "Nelson and Ellenberg compared published reports on the frequency of nonfebrile seizures following the occurrence of a first febrile seizure, as ascertained from hospital clinics or referral units, with the frequency as reported from population-based studies. The results are shown in Figure 1. Studies on defined populations, in which the attempt was made to recognize and follow up all affected persons regardless of medical care sought for the condition, are in close agreement and indicate relatively low rates of later nonfebrile seizures. In contrast, the results of Clinic-based studies demonstrate a wide variability in risks reported including very high frequencies of nonfebrile seizures. Furthermore, there was an easily identifiable small fraction of children with febrile seizures who could be identified as high risk for later nonfebrile seizures [18]. Thus medical knowledge of the risk of nonfebrile seizures following febrile seizures generated from population based studies is dramatically lower today than the knowledge garnered from clinic based studies in the 1970s that suffered from selection bias."}, {"section_title": "Risk of cognitive sequelae", "text": "Studies during the 1970's reported mixed results regarding mental development, including school performance and mental retardation, following febrile seizures. Mental retardation was reported [19,20] in two follow-up studies and a decline in IQ in a twin study [21]. In contrast, Ellenberg and Nelson reported that children with febrile seizures did not demonstrate a decrease in intellectual function [22,23], nor was there any demonstration of decline in academic achievement seen in the British Birth Cohort Study [24] or in the study in the uncontrolled study by Wallace and Cull [25]. More recently, Wolf and Forsythe reported a one percent prevalence of mental retardation (MR) following febrile seizures [26], although about half of those with MR had abnormal development prior to the febrile seizure. Thus the literature was providing mixed messages, apparently with the fear of intellectual damage following febrile seizures being the louder of the two messages."}, {"section_title": "INTERVENTION Antipyretic treatment", "text": "Antipyretics were and are known to prevent and reduce fever. However, while a logical approach to management, it was not known in the 1970s whether use of antipyretics at the start of an illness or during a fever, would ultimately reduce the risk of onset of febrile seizures. A primary issue was knowing when to initiate such therapy, especially if a child, as is often the case, develops a fever in the middle of the night, or if, as is also often the case, the seizure is the first sign of the illness. Sahib and Barry reported in a 2003 review, based on studies done in the late 90's and early 2000's, that \"Controlled studies of antipyretic medications, given during the original acute illness following a febrile seizure or during subsequent febrile episodes have failed to show a preventive effect in children at risk of FS\" [27]. Basically what was thought correct in the 70's, based on logic, has since been shown to be incorrect."}, {"section_title": "Anticonvulsant treatment", "text": "A summary of the then state of knowledge of the benefits and risks of anti-seizure medications as prevention for recurrent febrile seizures was provided in 1980 at the NIH Consensus Conference on Febrile Seizures [28]. The Consensus Committee concluded that \"\u2026prophylaxis reduces the risk of subsequent febrile seizures and there is no evidence that it reduces the risk of subsequent nonfebrile seizures.\" The Committee further reported that for the most widely used prophylactic drug, phenobarbital, reactions are reported in 40 percent of infants and children . These include behavioral changes, sleep pattern disturbances and interference with higher cortical or cognitive function. Twenty years later, the American Academy of Pediatrics Subcommittee on Quality Improvement concluded that \"\u2026neither continuous nor intermittent anti-convulsant therapy is recommended for children with 1 or more simple febrile seizures.\" This leaves open the possibility of intervention for the small proportion of children with high risk for later non febrile seizures (approximately 6% [29]). While several treatments had been added to the anticonvulsant armamentarium in the twenty years since the Consensus Conference, all still demonstrated various risks of important side effects [30]. A recent review of the clinical trials on management of febrile seizures [31] concluded that \"\u2026 the effectiveness of phenobarbital and diazepam could not be demonstrated because clinical trials were clinically, methodologically, and statistically heterogeneous.\" Summarizing, the use of phenobarbital in the 1970s as the drug of choice for prophylaxis of either recurrent febrile seizures or eventual epilepsy was later shown not to be efficacious and with a considerably higher risk profile than then believed. This state of equipoise allowed the NIH to sponsor a clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of phenobarbital for prophylaxis of febrile seizures [32]. The study was the largest randomized double blind study done on this issue and summarizing the results, the efficacy of phenobarbital was no better than placebo; and there was a clinically meaningful and statistically significant decrease in the IQ of children who were treated with phenobarbital. A contrast between the incorrect knowledge that was either evidence based or presumed in the 1970's and 2000 is shown in Table 3. One can speculate as to whether the then incorrect and sobering high risks attendant to febrile seizures led to the willingness to presume the safety and efficacy of prophylaxis shown. However, I strongly advocate that the primary culprit in this management mishap was the use of selected samples in estimation of the sequelae of febrile seizures. As illustrated in the preceding discussion of \"facts\" that were thought to be true in the 1970s but dramatically changed when reassessed with evidence from samples less prone to selection bias, it is dangerous and simply wrong to ignore fundamental design aspects of clinical studies. In the case of febrile seizures, results that were based on samples that were vulnerable to selection bias led to incorrect results that led to poor and dangerous clinical management of a self limited disorder. The assessment of the management of febrile seizures, the need for which was fueled by incorrect estimates of risk of this basically self limited disorder, was inconsistent, using various cohort definitions and procedures that were not correctly generalizable. The primary flaw in the voluminous and consistently incorrect reporting on the risk of sequelae of febrile seizures was selection bias as outlined above. The NCS is determined not to make this mistake, beginning instead with a national probability sample and following the sample of children over the next 21 years , while protecting the inferential base from post sample selection bias. The remainder of the paper will deal with the potential for and prevention of post selection bias."}, {"section_title": "THE INFERENTIAL BASE OF THE NCS AND MAJOR POTENTIAL", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "SOURCES OF SELECTION BIAS", "text": "The National Children's Study as a random sample of the households in the US will begin as an unselected sample and a primary objective is to maintain this pristine state of affairs to the degree feasible."}, {"section_title": "INITIAL SELECTION", "text": "There are several and continuing major hurdles to overcome which for simplicity we have partitioned into three critical points in the sequence from study entry to study completion. The first is to create community awareness in the chosen sampling segments to make sure that selected households have an awareness of the study, allow study personal to make contact in their household, and ultimately joining the study. The NCS believes that its extensive planned efforts for community involvement will play a very large role in the success of this stage. The next critical stage is when NCS study personnel have the first opportunity to speak with potential participants. The NCS has planned for an informative interview, including a real time video shown on a portable player that explains the reason and scope of the NCS, a comprehensive discussion of the nature of the protocol and what will be involved for the participants and their children, and the process of informed consent. Finally, beginning with the first contact and continuing throughout the NCS, the NCS staff will make every effort to maintain interest and excitement in the study by keeping the participants informed, maintaining contact with the participants through individual and community based awareness programs, and perhaps most importantly, making their participation in the NCS as easy, welcoming, and simple as possible."}, {"section_title": "ATTRITION", "text": "While the NCS is unique in many of its facets, the core design factor of longitudinal followup is common to many other longitudinal studies that have managed to successfully retain participant contact over many years. respectively. Of the individuals originally interviewed at baseline (1979) for the NLS79 cohort, after almost 30 years, over 75% were available for interview in 2004 [36]. For the later cohort NLSY97, 84 % were available for interview in 2006-07 (13 years after baseline) [37]. The NCS is committing the necessary resources to make sure that it can achieve similar or higher retention rates than seen above. Attrition can occur after eligibility is checked but prior to consenting and then after the consent process. Once consented, numerous forces may work against the NCS in maintaining the cohort and in keeping the cohort actively involved during their long participation in the project. We strongly believe [38] that community awareness and community involvement will aid immeasurably to the successful completion of the extensive (but not burdensome) system of contacts planned with the participants. Nonetheless, there are three primary areas that will pose considerable challenges for maintaining high levels of participation: respondent mobility, survey burden and loss of interest by the respondent. I discuss each in turn. Mobility-There is little solid research on lifetime mobility, how it plays out and how it may be predicted from personal and demographic factors. But there are some interesting available statistics that allow us to consider the potential mobility for the NCS cohort. It is expected that most moves should be proximate, at least in the period after registration. For women in the relevant age range 18-55 in 2004, the Census Bureau reports that 83% did not move within one year, while 9.6% moved within the same county and 3.4% moved within the same state [39]. So, in these data only about 4% moved beyond the state border within one year's time. Fell et al. in 2004 reported that in their cohort, that 12% of women moved between conception and delivery although 62% moved within the same municipality [40]. It would be beneficial to be able to predict movement so that extra resources could be focused on maintaining contact with mothers at high risk for mobility, but the literature on propensity to move is not reassuring that these predictions can be successful. Lu, for example, using the American Housing Survey reported that of those that indicated that they intended to move, only 44% carried through with their intentions in the next few years, and for those that did not have the intention to move, 13% moved in the next few years. The authors point out that prediction of movement is \"constrained choice behavior\" in that there are myriad factors that can alter one's options or ability to carry out one's wishes [41]. The NCS has concluded that risk of moving will not be predictable based on current research and have developed a structure and allocated resources to minimize the potential loss of study information and introduction of bias from such a loss through the following measures: \u2022 Those participants that move within or reasonably close to the catchment area or of their originally assigned centers will continue to be processed there. This scenario, we believe, will be the norm. \u2022 Those participants that move from one area to the catchment area of one of the 105 NCS centers around the country will be transferred to the new center. \u2022 Those that move from one area to another area not covered by the network of NCS centers will have data collection don by local facilities, arranged for by the NCS Coordinating Center. Burden-The design of the NCS calls for extensive efforts to reduce the burden of participation. Participants will be accommodated with clinic visit scheduling on several days each week, including evening and weekend appointments. Home visits will be scheduled using sophisticated visit flow control that maximizes availability of appointment times for participants while minimizing travel time for NCS interviewers. The visits, both clinic and home, will be as efficient as possible. Times at clinics will be blocked with prearranged scheduling and presence of children and other potential distractions will be taken into account. The development of the protocol and the details of exactly what information is to be collected has and continues to take account of several constraints. Scientific need and cost are to some degree open to negotiation, patient burden is not. Finally, in the event participants consider or decide to drop out of the study, reasonable and non coercive approaches will be made to convert dropouts, using letters and personal conversion interviewers."}, {"section_title": "Loss of interest:", "text": "Interest and satisfaction levels will be monitored throughout the study to ascertain problem areas and to institute corrective actions as required. Interim contacts with participants including birthday cards will be frequent. In addition to newsletters and other participant contacts, involvement of the community will continue after the enrollment period to maintain a continuous public awareness of the NCS. The NCS will continuously confirm address and other contact information as well as tracing contact reference information during periodic contacts with participants. When location information is not current, updated data will be obtained. Reminder letters and calls will be made for each visit. The NCS will monitor the characteristics of dropouts and will use statistical modeling for forecasting unit attrition from the NCS evolving data. This will allow both for possible corrections in the NCS process that might be deficient and for palliative contact with participants thought to be at high risk for dropping out. The NCS ability to maintain contact will become more difficult once the children are beyond secondary secondary school age, since both access to school contacts as well as maintenance of awareness of the NCS through planned community involvement will likely dissipate. Thus it is critical that the NCS create a stung bond of loyalty in the early years that will remain over the out years of the follow-up. The NCS will make a great effort to build loyalty, to motivate mothers and their children to want to be in the study, and will dedicate resources to pursue all cases to minimize attrition over time. The scientific credibility and inferential capability will be highly dependent on the ability of the NCS to overcome the challenges above and maintain a motivated, loyal, and connected cohort of participants. The NCS will doggedly pursue this goal."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "After many years of public debate involving experts in surveys, epidemiology, survey statistics, and biostatistics as well as the clinical disciplines involved, the decision was made to design the NCS as a national probability sample. One of the major benefits that accompanies this decision is the potential of freedom from selection bias in determining the cohort. This approach should provide a representative cohort, and the results derived from this cohort can be generalized to the US population. The benefit derived from using a nonselected sample is enormous as demonstrated by the examples herein. However, this benefit can be diminished if: the choice to join the NCS brings about its own selection bias (e.g. low SEI factors into potential participants' decisions to join the study); if, after joining, participants drop out of the study in a fashion related to demographics or potential outcomes (e.g. predilection for participants with at risk pregnancies to maintain their membership); if after joining, participants quit the study for non random reasons (e.g. related to environmental factors); or if, after joining the NCS, participants miss scheduled data collection appointments, or do not complete visit schedules (e.g. participants with smooth obstetric or pediatric course may not feel it important to follow the protocol specified visit schedule to the letter or may not participate in tests or interviews that are annoying to them). The above concerns for sample degradation are no more likely to face a randomly selected cohort than a clinic based cohort. However, the import of sample degradation on inferential validity is considerably more important for a random sample that for a clinic derived cohort since generalization in the latter case is problematic from the onset. The goal of the NCS with respect to design and its implementation is to achieve the most representative sample as feasible by protecting the randomly selected cohort against the post selection bias that will accrue if the protections set in place are not as effective as possible.
