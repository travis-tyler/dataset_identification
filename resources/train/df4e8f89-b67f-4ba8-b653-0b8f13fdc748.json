[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] For example, children born with low birthweight are more likely to exhibit neurological abnormalities, lower intelligence, behavioral problems, and medical conditions compared with children born with normal weight. 1, 3 Racial or ethnic minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are more likely to experience adverse birth outcomes.\nIn the United States (US) in 2016, the proportion of black infants born with low birthweight (<2500 g) was 13 .7% compared with 7.0% of white infants born with low birthweight. 6 In addition, mothers from low-income households are more than twice as likely to have low-birthweight infants compared with women from high-income households. 7 One of the determinants of adverse birth outcomes is maternal health behavior. For example, maternal smoking during pregnancy has been associated with low birthweight, preterm birth, and perinatal deaths. [8] [9] [10] [11] Prenatal health education to promote positive health behaviors can play an important role in preventing adverse birth outcomes. Indeed, receipt of prenatal health education has been associated with reduced risks of low and very low birthweight in infants. 12, 13 Studies that have examined prenatal health education often model it as a predictor rather than an outcome on its own [14] [15] [16] or focus on a selected health topic. 14, 17 In addition, although disparities in adverse birth outcomes are well known with racial or ethnic minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups having higher risks for these events, [18] [19] [20] [21] few studies have examined disparities in the receipt of prenatal health education. One study examined the racial variations in receipt of advice from health care practitioners during pregnancy using data drawn from the 1988 National Maternal and Infant Health Survey. 22 This study focused on receiving advice on four topics including tobacco use, alcohol consumption, drug use, and breastfeeding. The results demonstrated that black women, compared with white women, experienced greater odds of not receiving advice on alcohol use or smoking cessation during pregnancy. The study also found that low household income compared with high household income was associated with greater odds of not receiving advice on smoking cessation and breastfeeding. Furthermore, low maternal education compared with high maternal education was associated with greater odds of not receiving advice on alcohol cessation and breastfeeding. 22 These findings suggested that receipt of prenatal health education, just as birth outcomes, is socially patterned. The scarcity of research about the determinants of prenatal health education can be attributed to the lack of a standardized set of health topics that should be covered during "}, {"section_title": "| Measurement of predictors", "text": "Race or ethnicity had six categories: non-Hispanic white, nonHispanic black, Hispanic, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian Pacific Islander, and multiracial.

The analysis sample size was 68 025. Bivariate analysis was conducted using chi-square tests to assess the associations between the outcome and covariates. Five separate logistic regression models were computed to examine the association of race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic variables and receiving counseling on all listed health topics, HIV testing, breastfeeding, alcohol, and smoking. Each model controlled for the variables whose P-values in the bivariate associations were <0.1. Sampling weights were used to make data representative of women delivering live births in each state.

About 34.4% of women had a high school diploma or less and 35.3% had a household income <$26 000. The proportion of women who received WIC assistance during pregnancy was 41.9%. Most women had private health insurance for prenatal care (50.1%) followed by those with Medicaid (38.6%). About 3.2% reported no health insurance for prenatal care. Most women were between the ages of 25 and 34 (59.1%), married (63.9%), did not smoke in the 3 months before pregnancy (78.2%), drank alcohol in the 3 months before pregnancy (58.2%), had no chronic illnesses before becoming pregnant (86.4%), and started prenatal care during the first trimester (87.1%). The proportion of women who reported receiving all listed prenatal health education topics was 26.4% (Table 2 ). Bivariate analysis showed that all variables except the trimester when prenatal care started were significantly associated with receiving all prenatal health advice. Greater proportions of black (39.4%), Hispanic (33.2%), American Indian or Alaska Native (33.2%), and multiracial (27.6%) women reported receiving all prenatal health topics compared with non-Hispanic white women (22.7%). A higher proportion of women with less than a high school degree (35.7%) reported receiving all prenatal health education than those with a college degree or more (17.5%). More women from low-income households (34.5%) reported receiving complete prenatal health advice compared with those from high-income households (17.2%). A higher proportion of women on WIC (34.8%) reported receiving all prenatal health topics than those not on WIC (20.3%). More women on Medicaid (34.2%) reported receiving all prenatal health advice compared with those with private health insurance (19.9%) for prenatal care. Furthermore, higher proportions of women who were from younger age groups, unmarried, had a previous live birth with an adverse outcome, smoked in the 3 months before pregnancy, did not drink alcohol 3 months\nbefore pregnancy, and had a chronic illness before becoming pregnant reported receiving all prenatal health topics compared with reference groups.\nThe proportions of women who reported receiving counseling on HIV testing, breastfeeding, alcohol use, and smoking were 70.2%, 81.5%, 70.2%, and 69.5% with similar racial or ethnic and socioeconomic distributions as those who received counseling on all listed topics.

Women from racial or ethnic minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups reported receiving higher levels of prenatal health education compared with women from advantaged groups. Our finding that racial or ethnic minorities had greater odds of receiving prenatal health advice was consistent with the existing literature. One study using the Oregon PRAMS from 2000 to 2001 found that black women had a higher probability of receiving smoking cessation advice compared with white women. 17 Another study using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort demonstrated that black and Hispanic mothers were more likely to receive advice on several health-related topics including smoking and alcohol use during pregnancy than white mothers. 29 Our findings, however, contrasted with results from a previous study, which found that being black, having <12 years of education, and low-income household (indicators of traditionally disadvantaged groups) were associated with greater odds of not receiving prenatal health education. 22 Kogan et al 22 also found that having Medicaid was not associated with receiving prenatal health education while we found a significant association. The discrepancies between our results and those of Kogan et al can be attributed to health care practitioners targeting health education to minority women and those from low socioeconomic backgrounds as they have been consistently identified as having greater risks for adverse birth outcomes. T A B L E 2 (Continued) practitioners inadvertently miss opportunities to provide counseling to white women and those from high socioeconomic backgrounds who may not have been identified as having greater health risks. In addition, advantaged women may be more likely to decline opportunities for prenatal health education when offered as they already have the knowledge. Our finding that mothers who received WIC during pregnancy had greater odds of receiving prenatal health education agreed with that of Kogan et al 22 which found that WIC nonparticipants had higher odds of not receiving counseling on alcohol, smoking cessation, and breastfeeding compared with WIC participants. 22 The reason for more WIC participants reporting counseling on health-related topics can be attributed to the WIC's mission, which mandates the provision of nutrition counseling to pregnant mothers. 30 The results showed that health advice during prenatal care visits is not uniform across racial and socioeconomic backgrounds, which may not necessarily indicate a negative trend. The United States Public Health Service Expert Panel advocates that prenatal care counseling should be tailored based on the risks identified for each individual mother. 23 One mother might have a set of risk factors that are very different from another, and therefore, their respective care plans might look very different as well. In our study, drinkers were more likely to report receiving counseling on alcohol cessation and smokers were more likely to report receiving counseling on smoking cessation. This indicates that health care practitioners are targeting groups based on their health risks. In addition, women reported receiving education about breastfeeding regardless of household income levels.\nA potentially negative impact of the racial and socioeconomic differences in prenatal health education can be reflected in a study that examined the changing patterns in adverse birth outcomes among United States mothers. 31 The study compiled United States natality data from 1981 to 1998 and found that the gap in preterm birth and low birthweight narrowed between white and black infants, not due to any positive trends, but rather due to larger increases in preterm birth and low birthweight among white than among black infants. Further research is necessary to understand the reasons behind racial and socioeconomic variations in prenatal health education, and whether the association between prenatal health education and adverse birth outcomes varies across racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups."}, {"section_title": "| Strengths and limitations", "text": "The main strength of this study is the use of a population-based survey that oversampled women from underrepresented groups. Another strength is the examination of several disparities (ie, racial and socioeconomic) in a variety of health-related topics. Some limitations, however, do exist for our study. First, data about prenatal counseling on health topics were collected using self-report from mothers and were not verified using medical records. Recall bias can occur if women inaccurately report receiving counseling. Women were surveyed 2-4 months postpartum about prenatal care. In some cases, it would have been a year or more since women started prenatal care. Recall bias, however, is a common occurrence with retrospective data. Use of medical records to provide supplemental information or real-time data collection of receipt of prenatal health advice could help to control for this bias. Another limitation is the exclusion of states that did not reach the threshold for data release. This can affect the generalizability of our results. However, our sample size was substantial even with the exclusion of those states and covered over one-half of United States states."}, {"section_title": "| Conclusions", "text": "In a large sample of United States mothers, the content of prenatal care varied by racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic factors. Women from racial or ethnic minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds were more likely to receive prenatal counseling on health behaviors compared with those from advantaged backgrounds. However, despite reporting higher levels of prenatal counseling on a variety of health-related topics, women from disadvantaged groups continue to experience higher rates of adverse birth outcomes suggesting that prenatal education is insufficient in reducing disparities. The evaluation of the current prenatal health education and the inclusion of other forms of intervention may be necessary to ensure positive behaviors and birth outcomes."}]
