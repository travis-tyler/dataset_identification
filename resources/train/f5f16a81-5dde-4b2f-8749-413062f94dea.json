The neuropathology of AD is hypothesized to be a cascade of \u03b2-amyloid plaques, tau-mediated neuronal injury, and tissue loss leading to cognitive impairments .\nThe putative course of clinical progression in AD begins with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), later converting to AD as cognitive abilities decline.\nClinically, the level of cognitive impairment is typically established using tests of mental status including the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE). However, the development of robust imaging biomarkers for AD has the potential for clinical impact (Frisoni, Fox, Jack, Scheltens, & Thompson, 2010) , particularly in prognostication of cognitive decline. More specifically, an important goal for neuroimaging biomarkers is to accurately predict whether a patient presenting with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) initially will degrade further to severe cognitive impairment, converting to AD, or remain stable.\nTo aid the search for imaging biomarkers of AD, the ADNI project was conceived to provide a longitudinal, publicly available dataset for researchers (Jack et al., 2008) . A major focus of ADNI-based imaging studies has been to investigate whether the trajectories of cortical and subcortical gray matter atrophy predict cognitive decline (Weiner et al., 2013) . Cortical gray matter atrophy occurs along a temporo-spatial gradient with disease progression, occurring first in the temporal cortex and followed by occipital, parietal, frontal atrophy ). In patients with AD, gray matter volume is significantly reduced across the whole cortex, apart from the primary motor/sensory and visual cortex which are relatively spared. Examination of volumetric and shape trajectory with disease progression in the subcortical gray matter nuclei and ventricles has shown marked atrophy of the hippocampus, amygdala, and ventricular enlargement in AD Qiu, Fennema-Notestine, Dale, & Miller, 2009) . Willette, Calhoun, Egan, and Kapogiannis (2014) applied independent component analysis to gray matter tissue maps to achieve approximately 80% accuracy for classifying MCI converters versus MCI nonconverters.\nRelatively few papers have examined white matter atrophy in AD (Migliaccio et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2009) . Migliaccio et al. (2012) compared healthy controls to AD patients (non-ADNI) and found atrophy in lateral temporal and parietal regions, including cingulum and posterior corpus callosum. Zhang et al. (2009) examined diffusion metrics to characterize white matter microstructure in Alzheimer's disease compared to front-temporal dementia. This study found that white matter microstructure was less affected in AD compared to frontotemporal dementia.\nTypically, these studies rely on high-dimensional, nonlinear image registration techniques (Davatzikos, Genc, Xu, & Resnick, 2001; Shen & Davatzikos, 2003) and/or complex cortical segmentation procedures (Fischl, 2012 ) that can be computationally costly when applied to large cohorts and may require manual intervention or editing in extreme anatomical cases. Additionally, these studies typically used voxel-based morphometry, which is sensitive to chosen parameters such as smoothing size.\nWe recently introduced a method for extracting the midsagittal plane, corpus callosum and generating thickness profiles (Adamson et al., 2011; Adamson, Beare, Walterfang, & Seal, 2014) . This process can be quickly applied to any T1-weighted MR image to summarize callosal curvature and midsagittal callosal thickness within 8 subdivisions. Midsagittal callosal area closely correlates with total myelinated axonal fiber count (Riise & Pakkenberg, 2011) , and studies show greater thickness of the corpus callosum is linked to measures of general cognitive ability (Luders et al., 2007) . To date, there has been one other study of CC morphology change with disease progression in ADNI (Elahi, Bachman, Lee, Sidtis, & Ardekani, 2015) . This paper used regional area and circularity, a measure of bending, and showed statistically significant differences between MCI converters and nonconverters.\nHowever, these group differences were not prognostic in nature.\nWe propose that callosal measures serve as a surrogate marker of cerebral atrophy, providing an alternative to computationally taxing whole-brain approaches. The aim of this paper was to test whether callosal thickness is as effective in classifying conversion from MCI to AD from first-visit data as more comprehensive measures of cerebral atrophy. Subjects were initially grouped per cognitive ability into Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and otherwise healthy controls (CTL). Cognitive ability was assessed using the global score on the Clinical Dementia Rating, which was administered at every visit."}, {"section_title": "| ME THODS", "text": "The CDR score has the following possible values (0 = none, 0.5 = questionable, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe).

Demographic information for these groups is presented in Table 1 ."}, {"section_title": "| NEUROIMAG ING DATA PREPRO CE SS ING", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "| Callosal thickness", "text": "Callosal thickness measurements were obtained with an automated callosal thickness profile generation pipeline (Adamson et al., 2014) . Briefly, this extracts the midsagittal slice, segments the corpus callosum, and generates cross-sectional traversals along the midline of the corpus callosum; the arc lengths of these traversals define callosal thickness. Mean thickness was calculated within 8 callosal subdivision defined by the parcellation schemes of Witelson (1989) and Hofer and Frahm (2006) . Additionally, a callosal bending angle was computed as the angle between vectors emanating from the midpoint of the corpus callosum to the apices of the genu and splenium."}, {"section_title": "| Subcortical volumes", "text": "Deep gray matter structure volumes were extracted using FIRST (Patenaude, Smith, Kennedy, & Jenkinson, 2011) .

Feature selection was performed using the margin-maximizing feature elimination method (MFE; Aksu, Miller, Kesidis, & Yang, 2010) . LinearSVC is dependent upon a regularization term (C) which weighs the contribution from the data fidelity term. A grid search was used to select C from {10 \u22127 , 10 \u22126 , \u2026, 10 2 }. The classifier was then trained using the selected features and optimized parameter choice on the full training set.\nFeature importance was assessed by calculating the proportion of folds in which a feature was selected.\nIn this paper, the definition of conversion to AD is based on cognitive decline and on CDR scores, which have been used as gold standard labels in a traditional supervised classification problem.

In these papers, voxel-wise measures of gray matter expansion or contraction required to warp to a common template were used as feature sets. Feature selection identified temporal cortical gray matter volume and hippocampal volume as being informative for classification. Classification accuracies for the CTL/AD stage were high at 94% (Misra et al., 2009 ) and 80% (Filipovych & Davatzikos, 2011) . However, the N-CDR/C-CDR classification accuracy rates were, on average, lower. In Ref. ( Predicting CDR values, and thus conversion, from brain markers carries uncertainties of structure/function relationships with the added variance of high variability of cognitive testing scores (Chou et al., 2010 ).\nThis paper compared callosal, cortical, and subcortical gray matter volumetric feature sets for CTL/AD and MCI converter classification.\nAccuracy was highest when classifying control and AD patients using cortical thickness features derived from Freesurfer (90%), followed by FIRST-derived deep gray volumes (82%) and callosal thickness measurements (63%). Feature selection probabilities indicated that the most informative features were left and right entorhinal cortical thickness and hippocampal volumes. Atrophy of these structures is commonly reported in early disease states (Weiner et al., 2013 ).\nThere were no specific regions of the CC that were particularly informative and thus suggestive of a global CC atrophy occurring in AD (Ardekani, Bachman, Figarsky, & Sidtis, 2014; Teipel et al., 2002) .\nThe review of Di Paola, Spalletta, and Caltagirone (2010) of callosal atrophy work found the most robust findings were atrophy of genu and splenium with varying results in the midbody. The finding of posterior callosal atrophy of Migliaccio et al. (2012) was not found; however, the feature selection probabilities were computed in a different F I G U R E 2 Classification scores for MCI patients using the classifier trained on CTL/AD for each feature set. The top row shows nonconverting (N-CDR) patients, and the bottom row shows converting MCI patients (C-CDR). In each plot, light gray represents MCI patients who converted based on brain trajectory (CT), and dark gray denotes those that did not (NT). The group \"Reverse\" (mid-gray) denotes subjects that unexpectedly transitioned from AD to CTL. The star markers denote visits of CDR = 0.5, and the circle markers denote CDR \u2265 1 fashion to the p-value based results in that paper. The lower accuracy of the CC suggests that AD is a disease affecting gray matter more than white matter. The white matter atrophy reported by Migliaccio et al. (2012) was confined to the posterior corpus callosum and its nearby cortical projections. The spatial extent of these findings was sparse compared to the brain-wide atrophy of cortical gray matter and hippocampal tissue seen in other AD research (Weiner et al., 2013) . This paper performed comparison of all feature sets under the by-CDR conversion definition. The classification accuracies of all feature sets were relatively poor with averages ranging from 60% to 70%; this agrees with previous work (Aksu et al., 2011) . The CC feature set was particularly poor with an average accuracy rate of 56%.\nFeature selection probabilities were computed to assess which brain structures were the most informative in prognosticating disease state. Cortical thickness, particularly temporal and parietal cortex, and hippocampal volumes were consistently highest ranked for the CTL/AD classification scenario; these findings agree with earlier work (Risacher et al., 2010; Weiner et al., 2013) . In addition to these brain structures inferior parietal cortex, amygdala and posterior CC became more highly ranked. The putative progression of AD in terms of cortical atrophy takes on the following trajectory:\ntemporal, occipital, parietal, frontal with relative sparing of primary visual and motor cortex. The cortical projections from the posterior CC are the temporal, occipital, and parietal cortices (Hofer & Frahm, 2006) . Thus, the brain structures that are more informative for distinguishing subjects per functional impairment are associated with later stage atrophy. This finding also agrees with previous work (Aksu et al., 2011; Di Paola et al., 2010; Teipel et al., 2002) .\nThe generalization accuracy rates presented in this paper for gray matter structures at around 60%-70% are inferior to those achieved in other works on ADNI (Misra et al. 2009; Willette et al., 2014) . However, the goal of this paper was to only to compare feature set generalization ability for a single classification algorithm.\nOther methods have modeled the CC as a 3D object by incorporating the midsagittal and parasagittal slices and modeling thickness using medial axes (Styner, Gerig, Lieberman, Jones, & Weinberger, 2003) . Our study focused on a 2D, single-slice shape representation to make a shape representation to be as compact as possible.\nAdditionally, extending the segmentation to include parasagittal slices should not add a great deal of information not already captured in the midsagittal slice."}, {"section_title": "| CON CLUS ION", "text": "This paper assessed accuracy of prediction of conversion from MCI to AD using first-visit brain volume measures. We investigated whether the thickness of the midsagittal corpus callosum and its bending angle could be used as a biomarker for AD conversion compared to existing candidate biomarkers: cortical thickness and subcortical gray nuclei volumes. The CC was less accurate in predicting MCI to AD conversion. However, previous F I G U R E 3 Box plots of cross-validated generalizability rates for the N-CDR/C-CDR classification experiment for all feature sets. Chancelevel and noninformative accuracy is denoted by the line at 0.5. p-values for pairwise t tests are shown in the inset work suggests that the AD setting may not be optimal for the presented method, but it is worthwhile for diseases of white matter.\nWe propose that callosal measures represent a quick, simple addition to the search for an imaging biomarker in AD. Future research may incorporate these measures to aid clinical assessments in a rapid fashion.
