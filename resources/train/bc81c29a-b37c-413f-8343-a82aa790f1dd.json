[{"section_title": "", "text": "High school completion among dropouts was associated with socioeconomic status. Socioeconomic status (SES) was strongly associated with the proportion of dropouts who completed high school. Dropouts from families in higher SES quartiles were more likely to complete high school than others. For example, almost three-quarters (74 percent) of dropouts whose families were in the highest SES quartile finished high school, compared with 33 percent of dropouts whose families were in the lowest SES quartile (table 1). Dropouts who demonstrated academic ability, but not necessarily academic performance, were most likely to complete high school. Among dropouts, higher 1988 test scores were associated with the likelihood of having completed high school by 1994. For example, three out of four dropouts (76 percent) who scored in the highest test quartile completed high school, compared with 30 percent of those who scored in the lowest test quartile (table 1). Although both test scores and grades were associated with dropouts who completed a diploma, test scores, but not grades, were associated with those who completed a GED. For example, 51 percent of dropouts scoring in the highest test quartile completed a iii HIGHLIGHTS GED, compared with 18 percent of those scoring in the lowest test quartile. However, similar proportions of those who passed the GED had grade averages in the A to B, C, or the D or F range: about 24 percent of dropouts had A or B averages, 27 percent had C averages, and 27 percent had D or F averages (table 1). By 1994, two years after most of the cohort completed high school, high school completion among dropouts was associated with some educational, but few employment, characteristics.' In 1994, most dropouts were either working, looking for work, or at home. About the same proportion of dropouts as 1988 eighth graders who had never dropped out reported working full time or part time in 1994 (60 and 63 percent, respectively; table 9a). Working, however, was the only activity in which both these groups partook in 1994. Those who never dropped out were much more likely to be taking academic courses. More than half (57 percent) of those who had never dropped out were enrolled in 2-or 4-year postsecondary institutions in 1994, compared with 8 percent of dropouts who were similarly enrolled. Dropouts, by comparison, were much more likely than those who had never dropped out to report keeping house or being full-time homemakers (18 compared with 5 percent). In addition, dropouts were also more likely to be looking for work (16 percent) than their counterparts who had not dropped out (6 percent; table 9a). One-quarter of dropouts enrolled in postsecondary education. About one in four dropouts (26 percent) had enrolled in a postsecondary institution by 1994. About 11 percent of dropouts had enrolled in a 2-or 4-year degree program; 11 percent had enrolled in a certificate program; and the remaining 4 percent had enrolled in other postsecondary programs (figure 7a). Among dropouts, those who completed high school by either a diploma or GED were much more likely than those who had not completed high school to obtain postsecondary education (42 percent of completers versus 14 percent of noncompleters reported having some postsecondary education;  Among 1988 eighth graders who worked fewer than 40 hours per week in 1993, percentage distribution according to desire to work more hours, by 1994 completion status"}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "In each of the past 10 years, about five students out of 100 have decided to drop out of high school.2 Since anecdotal and empirical evidence indicates that these youth will have a harder time advancing in their educations and careers, they have often been the subject of inquiry for both intervention and prevention purposes. Students have different reasons for dropping out. Some simply dislike school; some cannot get along with their teachers; or some perceive school as a waste of their time. Others begin working full time, either by choice or by necessity, and cannot maintain their schedules as students. For young women, pregnancy, childbirth, and subsequent childcare responsibilities may interfere with school, while young men who become fathers may have childcare duties or be required to work to support the family. Once students stop attending high school, however, their formal education has not necessarily ended. They may choose to reenroll, sometimes after a hiatus of several years, and eventually earn a high school diploma, enroll in an alternative school, or work toward a General Educational Development (GED) certificate. Some students drop back in and out of high school before they either earn a credential or give up altogether. Although the obstacles that originally prevented dropouts from completing high school may continue to deter their educational progress, some dropouts do earn a high school credential and continue their education. Why do some dropouts leave school and never go back, while others return to earn a diploma and even enroll in postsecondary programs? What characteristics distinguish a dropout who later graduates from one who receives an alternative credential? Does a dropout who completes high school have better opportunities for postsecondary education or employment in the work force? This report addresses these questions by first looking at students' circumstances at the time they first dropped out, and then by examining their employment and educational situations two years after most of the cohort had graduated from high school. Using the 1988 National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS:88/94), a survey of 1988 eighth graders, this report examines the secondary educational attainment of high school 2M. McMillen and P. Kaufman, U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Dropout Rates in the United States: 1995(Washington, DC: 1997, p. 85.\ndropouts. It assesses the circumstances under which the dropouts first left school, along with their reasons for dropping out; the extent to which they participated in intervention programs (such as individual or family counseling); the number of people they talked to about their decision to leave school; and how close they were to high school graduation before they dropped out. The report then examines the postsecondary enrollment and employment status of the dropouts in 1994, two years after most of the cohort had graduated from high school. In order to evaluate how staying out or returning to high school affected their employment opportunities or continued education, comparisons are drawn primarily between 1988 eighth graders who completed high school without dropping out, dropouts who completed a diploma or equivalency certificate, and dropouts who had not completed high school. Some studies, such as McMillen and Kaufman (1996), have evaluated the differing postsecondary and employment experiences of those with and without a high school diploma.3 They concluded that dropouts who graduated from high school faced serious impediments in other stages of adulthood. For example, they reported that dropouts enrolled in postsecondary education in smaller numbers and exhibited higher rates of unemployment. By isolating dropouts for analysis, this report builds on this earlier research. Although a sizable body of literature compares the employment and educational outcomes of regular diploma recipients with those who obtained a high school equivalent,4 fewer studies have focused on comparing groups of dropouts with each other. When they have done so, however, conclusions have at times been conflicting. For example, while some studies evaluating the economic returns to earning a GED suggest that recipients of an equivalency certificate fare better in the labor market than those with no credential, other researchers have found GED recipients to be indistinguishable from high school graduates and dropouts. Using 1979 through 1987 data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), Cameron and Heckman (1993) concluded that young men with GEDs earned the same average hourly wages and worked the same number of hours as those with no credential.5 Building on this research, Cao et al. (1996) examined the labor market experience of low-income women in the NLSY and Washington State Family Income Study (FIS). Overall, their analyses of these data sets produced similar results, INTRODUCTION finding it \"impossible to distinguish among high school graduates, GED recipients, and dropouts in terms of hours of work.\"6 Their analyses of the FIS data indicated that high school graduates, GED recipients, and dropouts all earned similar wages. On the other hand, Cao et al. (1996), using the NLSY data, found that high school graduates earned more than GED recipients, who in turn earned more than dropouts with no credential. In addition, Murnane, Willett, and Boudett (1995), using the NLSY data through 1991, found that earning a GED, as opposed to having no credential, had positive effects on the rate of wage growth for young men.7 Although the NELS:88/94 survey does not contain data about the academic performance of dropouts enrolled in a postsecondary institution, other researchers have found some evidence that GED recipients are less successful in postsecondary education than regular high school graduates. One such study conducted at a community college in Ohio found that students with a high school diploma had higher GPAs and attempted and completed more credit hours than did students with GEDs.8 However, this study compared a group of students with regular diplomas (who probably had not dropped out) with GED recipients (who most likely had dropped out). It is unclear whether similar results would have been found among groups of dropouts with different high school credentials. "}, {"section_title": "DEFINITIONS AND DATA", "text": "The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88/94) surveyed a cohort of eighth graders in 1988 and subsequently followed them at two-year intervals through 1994. Baseyear respondents who were not enrolled in school in 1990 or 1992 completed special dropout questionnaires. For the purposes of this report, students were considered dropouts if by 1992 1) they ever reported dropping out of high school; 2) they ever reported passing the GED exam; 3) their high school transcripts showed that they had dropped out or passed the GED exam; or 4) if in the 1994 survey, they reported that they were working on an alternative credential or they reported that they had not graduated and were not working on an alternative credential. Members of the 1988 eighth-grade cohort were classified as dropouts after they had dropped out for the first time, regardless of whether they eventually completed a credential. Educational outcomes were taken into account, however. This analysis compares dropouts who completed high school (completers) with those who did not (noncompleters). It further distinguishes among dropouts who either earned a high school diploma or an alternative credential, those who were still working to complete high school, and stayouts (i.e., dropouts who had not earned a high school diploma or equivalency certificate and were not working toward one).9 Due to its longitudinal nature, the NELS:88/94 survey is useful for studying the educational and occupational achievements of dropouts, as researchers can monitor dropouts' movements in and out of school as they work toward a diploma or alternative credential or track their progress in the work force. Since the analysis is longitudinal by design, only students who participated in all four waves of data collection are included. One limitation of the NELS:88/94 data is its time frame, which provides a six-year horizon beginning in eighth grade (1988)(1989)(1990)(1991)(1992)(1993)(1994), potentially too short a time after \"normal\" graduation to provide a complete picture of dropouts' educational activities or to demonstrate the full implications of their educational choices in the labor market. This report may underestimate the proportion of dropouts who will eventually earn a credential and, in particular, the percentage of dropouts who will earn a GED. The average age of GED test-takers is 25 years old, even though 9In previously published reports, \"stayout\" has referred to dropouts who never returned to high school. Because the NELS:88/94 data captures only a point in time for these youth, it is possible that they had previously returned to high school and were not attending at the time of the survey, or that they might return in the future. Furthermore, the definition of \"dropping out\" used in this report differs from the definition used in other NCES publications. the typical high school graduate is 17 or years old.1\u00b0 In 1994, 24 percent of the NELS:88/94 cohort members who had ever dropped out reported that they were working toward a GED or were still in high school (figure 1). However, there is some evidence that the number of dropouts who return to school tapers off as they age. Kolstad and Kaufman (1989), in analyzing the educational paths of dropouts in the 1982 High School and Beyond (HS&B) study, found that 38 percent of the dropouts had earned a diploma or GED by 1984, two years after most members of their cohort had graduated. The total had risen to 44 percent by 1986, suggesting that the majority\u00b0A merican Council on Education, Who Took the GED? GED 1995Statistical Report, ed. J. Baldwin (Washington, D.C. 1996 ,  table 3. of those who would ever earn a credential had done so within the first two years of the majority of cohort members' graduation.\" The NELS:88/94 survey data were most recently collected in 1994, two years after most of the 1988 eighth-grade cohort had graduated from high school. Kolstad and Kaufman's results suggest that analyzing the attainment of dropouts at this juncture in their lives will capture the majority, but not all, of dropouts who will ever return to school. Another implication of the lack of suitable time frame pertains to long-term economic outcomes. Building on the literature on human capital investments, King (1978), in his study of the labor market outcomes of high school dropouts using the National Longitudinal Survey, found no differences between dropouts and nondropouts after one year in the work force. However, he did find that \"age earning profiles of the graduates were steeper than those of the dropouts.\"\" After analyzing the data from these respondents after having been in the workforce for 13 years, he concluded: \"While the differences between graduates and dropouts were generally not pronounced immediately upon leaving school, they became significant over the ensuing 13-year periodat least as measured in 1971.\"\" The longitudinal scope of the NELS:88/94 data is, unfortunately, less than 2 years after high school, so the question then becomes: does high school attainment among dropouts associated with any evident employment or education trends in these first years after high school? 11A. Kolstad "}, {"section_title": "DROPOUT CHARACTERISTICS AND HIGH SCHOOL EXPERIENCES", "text": "The first wave of the NELS:88/94 survey began in 1988, initially sampling eighth graders. Subsequent follow-ups indicated that about one in five of this 1988 eighth-grade cohort (21 percent) dropped out of high school at least once between 1988 and 1994.\" Figure 1, which indicates the high school education status of dropouts after the Third Follow-up in 1994, shows that a sizable proportion of these dropouts had continued their high school education. For instance, by 1994, just under half (44 percent) of 1988 eighth graders who dropped out had completed high school (either a diploma or an alternative credential), and 24 percent were working on a diploma or GED (table 1). The remaining one-third of dropouts (32 percent) had no credential and were not pursuing any further education (figure 1)."}, {"section_title": "DROPOUT CHARACTERISTICS", "text": "In previous reports such as Dropout Rates in the United States: 1995, students from low income families were found to be more likely to drop out than students from high income families. Among 16-24 year olds who were from families in the bottom 20 percent of all family incomes, the status dropout rate was 23.2 percent, compared with the 2.9 percent status dropout rate of those from families in the top 20 percent.15 The racialethnic backgrounds of students also seemed to be associated with dropping out, although this may be associated with variations in income level. Hispanic students, in particular, for whom English may not be their first language, have higher dropout rates than black or white students. In 1995, 30 percent of Hispanics between the ages of 16 and 24 were dropouts, compared with 12 percent of black youth and 9 percent of white youth.16 Some of this difference, however, can be accounted for by immigrants not enrolled in U.S. schools: \"a third of the 30 percent dropout rate registered for all Hispanic youths is associated with the large proportion of Dropout Characteristics in the NELS:88/94 Data In the NELS:88/94 data, socioeconomic status (SES) was strongly associated with the proportion of dropouts who completed high school. Dropouts from families in higher SES quartiles were increasingly likely to complete high school. For example, almost three-quarters (74 percent) of dropouts whose families were in the highest SES quartile finished high school, compared with 33 percent of dropouts whose families were in the lowest SES quartile (table 1). Dropouts' racialethnic background was not associated with their likelihood of completing high school. Although the proportions of dropouts completing some form of high school appeared to differ by raceethnicity, there was not enough statistical evidence to conclude that these differences were significant (table 1). Similarly, when dropouts completing high school were examined according to their method of completion, no significant differences were found in the proportions of those completing high school diplomas with respect to racialethnic background. Asian/Pacific Islanders were less likely than white, non-Hispanic dropouts, however, to earn a GED (12 percent versus 31 percent) (table 1).19 Gender appeared to be associated with high school graduation among dropouts. For example, young women who dropped out were more likely than their male counterparts to return to school and earn a high school diploma (18 percent versus 13 percent) (table 1).20"}, {"section_title": "Academics", "text": "Dropouts who had high school grades at a C average or higher and eighth grade test scores in the top three quartiles were more likely to return to school and complete a diploma or GED than those who had not performed as well. Among dropouts, higher 1988 test scores were 17Ibid. p. 31. I8Ibid. p. 35. 19While there also appear to be differences between Asian/Pacific Islanders and the other three groups in the proportion of dropouts who earned a GED, these differences are associated with large standard errors, making the estimates somewhat unreliable. Thus, the differences are not statistically significant. 20There was some evidence that men were more likely than women to obtain a GED (32 percent versus 25 percent). This difference was significant at the 0.10 level, but not at the conventional 0.05 level. associated with the likelihood of having completed high school by 1994. For example, three out of four dropouts (76 percent) who scored in the highest test quartile completed high school, compared with 30 percent of dropouts scoring in the lowest test quartile (table 1). Similarly, dropouts' high school grades were also associated with their completing high school. About 49 percent of dropouts whose high school transcripts indicated that they had a C average completed a diploma or alternative credential, compared with 36 percent who had a D or F average (table   1).21 The association between dropouts' test scores and their likelihood of staying out was especially apparent. Among dropouts who scored in the highest quartile, 7 percent stayed out, compared with 42 percent among those who scored in the lowest quartile. Grades were similarly related. Dropouts who had a D or F average when enrolled in school were more likely to stay out than those who had a C average in high school (40 percent versus 27 percent; table 1).22 Among dropouts who completed high school, both grades and test scores were associated with completing a diploma. Dropouts who had a C average or higher in high school were more likely than those who had a D or F average to eventually attain a diploma (23 to 26 percent of A C students did so, compared with 9 percent of D and F students). Similarly, dropouts who had scored in the highest test quartile were more likely to complete a diploma than those who had scored in the lowest quartile (25 percent versus 12 percent; table 1). Although test scores were associated with dropouts completing a GED, grades were not. Dropouts' likelihood of completing a GED increased with their test scores. For example, 51 percent of former students scoring in the highest test quartile completed a GED, compared with 18 percent of former students scoring in the lowest test quartile. However, similar proportions of those who passed the GED had grade averages in the A to B range, C, or the D or F range: about 24 percent of dropouts with A or B averages, 27 percent with C averages, and 27 percent with D or F averages earned an alternative credential (table 1). Although dropouts who complete a GED may have academic ability (as indicated on their composite test scores), they did not necessarily perform as well in school as dropouts who returned to high school and earned a diploma (as indicated by their grades). Figure 2 shows the relationship between the students' overall grade point average in high school and their composite test scores in the eighth grade.  In general, dropout completers who had higher test scores in the eighth grade tended to have higher grade point averages in high school and dropouts who returned and received a high school diploma had higher grades in high school. However, the relationship between grades and test scores was different for dropouts with diplomas versus dropouts with GEDs. While hightesting dropouts with diplomas had correspondingly higher grades in high school, dropouts with GEDs had about the same grade point averages regardless of how well they had scored on the achievement test in the eighth grade. That is, higher achievement in eighth grade did not translate into high grades for dropouts with GEDs as it did for dropouts with diplomas (table 2).23 23This discussion is based on an Analysis of Variance derived from the DAS (see appendix B). "}, {"section_title": "Expectations", "text": "The educational expectations of both dropouts and their parents were associated with dropouts' actual academic outcomes six years later and were somewhat related to dropouts' high school completion. Among dropouts who in 1988 expected to earn a bachelor's degree or higher, about half (54 percent) had completed high school in 1994. Dropouts with lower educational expectations in 1988, however, were less likely to finish high school. One-third of those who expected to complete no more than a high school diploma completed high school, and 40 percent of those expecting to complete some postsecondary education completed high school. Similarly, dropouts whose parents in 1988 had expected them to earn a bachelor's degree or higher were also more likely to complete high school than dropouts whose parents had expected them to complete no more than a high school diploma (53 percent versus 34 percent; table 1). Among dropouts who completed high school, however, the educational expectations of parents and students in 1988 were associated only with a dropout's likelihood of completing a diploma, not with completing a. GED. About 20 percent of dropouts, who, expected to earn a bachelor's degree or higher earned a diploma, compared with 10 percent of dropouts who expected to complete high school or less. Parent expectations also corresponded with higher proportions of dropouts earning diplomas. About 21 percent of dropouts whose parents expected them to earn a bachelor's degree or higher received diplomas, compared with 10 percent of dropouts whose parents expected them to at most complete high school. Although the expectations of parents and students also appeared to be associated with the likelihood of dropouts getting a GED, there was not enough statistical evidence to conclude that these differences were significant (table 1).\nAs shown in table 16, some dropouts reported high expectations for their educational attainment. In 1994, about one in four dropouts with a high school diploma (26 percent) or GED (28 percent) expected to earn a bachelor's degree, and 27 and 20 percent more of each group, respectively, expected to earn an advanced degree. Although the proportions of stayouts sharing in these expectations were smaller, 10 percent still expected to earn a bachelor's degree, and 3 percent more expected to earn an advanced degree. About 12 percent of stayouts, dropouts who at the time of the survey were not continuing their education, did not expect to complete a diploma or enroll in postsecondary education (table 16). "}, {"section_title": "CIRCUMSTANCES OF LEAVING SCHOOL", "text": "Comparing the circumstances under which students decide to leave school with their later educational outcomes can help determine who is most at risk of permanently disconnecting from the educational system. The dropouts at greatest risk of not completing high school left school at a very young age, had job-related reasons for leaving school, and did not connect with institutional sources of support (such as their high school administration or an alternative school). Another factor associated with never completing is becoming a parent more than nine months after dropping out. The year that dropouts first left high school was associated with how they subsequently completed high school. Of dropouts who returned to finish high school, those who first left school in 9th grade were more likely than those who first dropped out in 11th or 12th grades to complete a GED (85 percent in 9th grade versus 62 to 69 percent in 11th and 12th grades), Whereas students who first dropped out in 11th or 12th grades were more likely than 9th graders to earn a diploma (38 and 31 percent versus 15 percent; figure 3). This association between when dropouts left school and their 1994 completion status is further demonstrated with respect to the number of credits earned: students with more than 15 credits when they first dropped out were much more likely to complete diplomas than were students with 10 or fewer credits (24 percent versus 11 to 12 percent; table 3).24"}, {"section_title": "Reasons for Leaving", "text": "In 1990 and 1992, dropouts who were not in school at the time of the follow-up surveys provided their reasons for dropping out and answered a series of questions about intervention activities and the people with whom they had discussed their decision to leave schoo1.25 When reasons for dropping out were aggregated into three general categoriesschool-, family-, or jobrelateddropouts were more than twice as likely to give school-related reasons as family-or jobrelated reasons (77 percent versus 34 and 32 percent, respectively; table 4). This is consistent with the data concerning their academic records, where 92 percent of all dropouts had grade 24There is some evidence that students with 10.01-15 credits were also less likely to earn a diploma than those with more than 15 credits. This distinction was significant at the 0.10 level, not at the conventional 0.05 level. 25Questions on reasons for dropping out and intervention activities were asked in both the 1990 and 1992 supplementary questionnaires. Responses from the 1992 questionnaire were included only if the 1990 information was missing. The data on discussions with various people about leaving school were taken solely from the 1992 dropout supplement. See appendix A for a complete description of these variables. averages of C's or lower (table 2). Dropouts who had not completed high school by 1994, however, cited employment reasons for having left more frequently than did dropouts who had completed high school. About 37 percent of dropouts who had not completed a credential cited at least one job reason for having left high school in 1990 or 1992, compared with 24 percent of dropouts who completed a diploma or GED (table 4). The specific reasons that dropouts reported for leaving high school are shown in table 5. Noncompleters were more likely to cite having gotten a job as a reason for dropping out (31 versus 22 percent). Completers were about as likely as noncompleters, however, to cite such reasons   "}, {"section_title": "Parenthood", "text": "Although one-third of dropouts cited family reasons for dropping out, young women were much more likely to give a family-related reason for dropping out than young men (53 percent versus 15 percent; figure 4). In order to examine the relationship between teen parenthood and the completion of high school, table 6 shows the timing of parenthood with respect to dropout date according to 1994 completion status. Dropouts who had children within nine months after dropping out (i.e., were expecting to become parents when they dropped out) were no less likely to complete high school than those who never had children (48 percent of both groups completed high school). Both groups, however, were more likely to complete high school than those who first became parents more than nine months after dropping out (31 percent; table 6). There was also some association between parenthood and graduation among dropouts who earned high school diplomas, although this was not the case for dropouts with GEDs. Dropouts without children were more likely to earn a diploma than dropouts who had children more than nine months after dropping out (6 percent; table 6). However, dropouts who had a baby nine or fewer months after leaving high school were as likely to complete high school diplomas as those who had no children (15 percent and 14 percent). "}, {"section_title": "Interventions", "text": "Various organizations attempt to help dropouts make the transition back into the role of student. Many dropouts who successfully completed high school had considered using or had used such a resource. Almost half (46 percent) of dropouts \"looked into' an alternative school or 32 GED;26 and about 30 percent of dropouts spoke to a counselor or social worker (figure 5). Dropouts who had completed a credential were more likely than those who had not to consider these interventions: 54 percent of completers compared with 41 percent of noncompleters considered an alternative school or GED, and 40 percent of completers compared with 24 percent of noncompleters spoke to a counselor or social worker about returning to school (figure 5).  26Because of the way the question was phrased on the survey, \"I looked into an alternative school or GED,\" one could not distinguish between students who attended an alternative school and those who merely considered attending. See appendix A for more details. In 1992, dropouts were also asked whether they had discussions with any third parties about continuing school since dropping out. About 86 percent of dropouts reported that they had talked with their parents, and about 76 percent had discussed the prospects of continuing school with their peers or with other relatives (table 7). Dropouts who had earned a diploma by 1994 were more likely than those who had earned a GED to have spoken with various school-related individuals-such as principals (47 versus 12 percent) and school counselors (57 versus 33 percent)-about continuing their education. Although there appears to be a similar difference between diploma recipients and GED recipients with regard to having such discussions with teachers (56 versus 38 percent), there is not enough statistical evidence to conclude that these differences were significant (table 7). "}, {"section_title": "MODEL OF COMPLETION AMONG DROPOUTS", "text": "As this analysis has shown thus far, there are different elements associated with a dropout's completion of high school. Because these factors are interrelated and working together simultaneously, it can be difficult to ascertain the independent influence of each on the outcome of completion. This type of analysis cannot reveal the unique relationship between each variable and high school completion status. This section uses linear regression to illustrate how certain characteristics are associated with a dropout's decision to complete high school, after controlling for a set of other characteristics. For information about the methodology, see appendix B. Table 8 shows the results of an analysis of high school completion, via either a diploma or GED, among dropouts. The first column displays the unadjusted percentagesthe proportion of dropouts who completed high school before controlling for the other variables in the tableand the second column displays the adjusted percentages for a hypothetical dropout with average values on the other variables. The italicized row in each set of characteristics represents the comparison group for significance testing, and the asterisks indicate cases where the percentage for a given group is significantly different from that of the comparison group. For example, the percentage of dropouts whose composite test scores were in the low and middle quartiles were less likely to have completed high school than those with high composite test scores both before and after adjusting for the other variables in the table. This analysis shows that adjusting for variation among these variables results in somewhat different patterns from those based on individual comparisons of the unadjusted percentages. Dropouts whose families were in the highest SES quartile were still more likely to complete high school than their counterparts in the other SES quartiles; completing high school was still more likely among dropouts with test scores in the highest quartile than among those in the other three quartiles; and dropouts who had children more than nine months after dropping out were still less likely to finish high school than their counterparts who never had children or were expecting at the time of the dropout event. However, adjusting for covariation resulted in different relationships with two variables: student expectations and GPA. Although dropouts who expected to complete a bachelor's degree or higher were still more likely to finish than dropouts who expected to complete no more than high school, prior to adjustment, dropouts expecting to earn a 35 bachelor's degree were also more likely to complete high school than those dropouts who expected to get some postsecondary education. This change is attributable to the inclusion of other variables such as test scores in the model; for example, dropouts with higher academic ability are also more likely to have higher expectations.27 Another possible explanation could come from the inclusion of socioeconomic status in the model, considering that, for example, completers in the lowest SES quartile were less likely to expect to complete a bachelor's degree than those in the middle or top quartiles.28 Even though dropouts who had C averages while enrolled were more likely to complete high school than dropouts who had mostly D and F averages before dropping out, after adjusting for covariation, GPA was no longer a significant factor. "}, {"section_title": "EMPLOYMENT AND ENROLLMENT", "text": "In order to establish enrollment and employment differences, the postsecondary enrollment and employment experiences of 1988 eighth graders are evaluated with respect to two factors: 1) dropping out and 2) high school completion. Dropouts are compared with those 1988 eighth graders who did not drop out. Further, dropouts are divided into two categories, based on completion status. This enables one to examine the ways in which dropouts who completed high school (dropout completers) resemble those who completed high school without having dropped out (traditional completers), as opposed to dropouts who did not complete high school (noncompleters). Consequently, the achievements of these youth can be benchmarked, providing evidence pertaining to the relationship of returning to complete high school after dropping out with postsecondary and employment opportunities. However, traditional completers enrolled in postsecondary degree programs are involved in activities very different from high school graduates working full time (see table 9a). As a result, comparisons between the all-inclusive groups of dropouts and those who had not dropped out may not be as meaningful as comparisons of dropouts to graduates without significant postsecondary experience. Thus, in an attempt to normalize the years of education across all students, the analysis is restricted to 1988 eighth graders not enrolled in or having completed associate's or bachelor's degree programs (i.e., their highest postsecondary attainment in 1994 was not an associate's or bachelor's degree nor any postsecondary activity that would lead to the completion of an associate's or bachelor's degree). Comparisons are then drawn between the employment and educational attainment of these youth according to whether they dropped out and, for dropouts, whether they completed high school."}, {"section_title": "CURRENT ACTIVITIES", "text": "In February 1994, slightly less than two years after most of their cohort had graduated from high school, those who had ever dropped out from the eighth-grade cohort of 1988 tended to be working or looking for a job. A smaller percentage of dropouts, however, particularly among those who had returned to school and earned a diploma or GED, were enrolled in postsecondary education. 'In the Third Follow-up Survey, both students and dropouts were asked to respond to the following question: \"Now, please think back to the middle of February 1994. At that time were you ... ?\" for each activity listed. Thus, percentages sum to more than 100. About the same proportion of dropouts as 1988 eighth graders who had never dropped out reported working full time or part time in 1994 (60 and 63 percent, respectively; table 9a). Those who had never dropped out, however, were much more likely to be taking academic courses. More than half (57 percent) of those who had never dropped out were enrolled in 2-or 4-year postsecondary institutions in 1994, compared with 8 percent of dropouts who were similarly enrolled. Dropouts, by comparison, were much more likely than those who had never dropped out to report keeping house or being a full-time homemaker (18 versus 5 percent). In addition, dropouts were also more likely to be looking for work (16 percent) than their counterparts who had not dropped out (6 percent; table 9a). Postsecondary enrollment appeared to make a difference in the types of activities that those who had never dropped out were participating in. To illustrate, 63 percent of all traditional completers were working full time or part time. After controlling for enrollment in an associate's or bachelor's degree program, however, 71 percent of traditional completers not working toward a postsecondary degree reported working full-or part-time (tables 9a and 9b). 'Postsecondary attainment for 1988 eighth graders was based on 1994 self-reported data of highest postsecondary education attained. Those not working toward an associate's or bachelor's were considered so because their highest postsecondary attainment was not completion of, or working toward, a 2-or 4-year degree. 21n the Third Follow-up Survey, both students and dropouts were asked to respond to the following question: \"Now, please think back to the middle of February 1994. At that time were you ... ?\" for each activity listed. Thus, percentages sum to more than 100. 3Those who had never dropped out had either 1) some postsecondary education (but not coursework leading to the completion of an associate's or bachelor's degree); 2) obtained or were working toward a certificate; or 3) no postsecondary education. 4\"No postsecondary education\" is a subset of the previous category. This category includes only those who had no postsecondary education. 5GED refers to General Education Development exam. Among dropouts, high school completion appeared to be associated with working full time or part time. Although noncompleters were less likely to be working than completers who both had or had not dropped out, dropout completers who were not taking courses leading to a postsecondary degree were no less likely to be working than traditional completers (56 percent for dropout noncompleters versus 68 and 71 percent; table 9b). Having dropped out, regardless of completion status, was associated with other 1994 activities. After eliminating students in postsecondary programs, those 1988 eighth graders who had never dropped out, but were not working toward a postsecondary degree, remained more likely to be taking academic courses at a 2-or 4-year college in February 1994 than their counterparts who had dropped out but completed high school (23 versus 5 percent). Traditional completers not working toward a postsecondary degree were also more likely than dropout completers to be on active duty with the armed forces (7 versus 2 percent). On the other hand, even though both groups had completed high school, those who had done so after dropping out were more likely to report they were homemaking full time than those who had never dropped out (15 versus 8 percent). Furthermore, dropout completers were twice as likely as traditional completers not enrolled in a postsecondary degree program to report they were looking for work (16 percent versus 8 percent; table 9b). Dropout completers and noncompleters, however, were not always comparable either. For instance, among those not pursuing a degree, completers were more likely than noncompleters to report being enrolled in academic courses (5 versus less than 1 percent; table 9b). Completers who had earned a high school diploma were less likely than most other dropouts to report that they were looking for work. About 8 percent of dropouts with a diploma were looking for work in 1994, compared with 14 percent of stayouts and 20 percent of dropouts working toward a credential. There is some evidence that diploma completers may also be less likely than GED completers to be looking for work (table 9b).3\u00b0L"}, {"section_title": "ABOR MARKET", "text": "This study found few differences in both the likelihood of employment and earnings among different groups of dropouts in 1993, one year after most of the 1988 eighth-grade cohort had graduated from high school.

For GED completers, labor market characteristics were similar to those of their dropout peers without a high school credential.

In order to compare those 1988 eighth graders who were workers instead of postsecondary students in 1993, enrollment in a postsecondary degree program was controlled for. As shown in table 11, among those not working toward a postsecondary degree, dropouts worked more hours, averaging 39 hours per week at their primary job in 1993, while those who had not dropped out worked 38 hours per week, on average (table 11). A higher proportion of 1988 eighth graders who had not dropped out were working part time, compared with dropouts. About 11 percent of those who had never dropped out worked 11 to 20 hours per week in 1993, compared with 7 percent of dropouts (table 11). Table 12 illustrates the types of industries in which 1988 eighth graders reported working in 1993. The most common occupations for dropouts in 1993 included service worker (22 percent), craftsman/operative (22 percent), laborer (20 percent), and clerical (17 percent). Dropouts were more likely than those who had not dropped out to be laborers (20 versus 11 percent), whereas those who had not dropped out were more likely than dropouts to be in the military or protective service (6 versus 3 percent), or working as professionals or teachers (3 versus 1 percent; table 12).  Among dropouts, completion of high school was associated with those youth reporting to be in the military or protective service.

Dropouts' wages were not positively associated with secondary school attainment.

However, among all dropouts, those still working toward a high school diploma or GED  This may be attributable to part-time employment. For example, after controlling for those working 35 or more hours per week, dropouts who completed a diploma had higher 1993 average earnings than dropouts who were working on their high school credential ($10,600 versus $8,300; table 14), but other dropouts did not.

The remaining 4 percent were enrolled in other postsecondary programs (figure 7a). Among dropouts, completion of high school was associated with postsecondary attainment.

Dropout completers were less likely than traditional completers to enroll in a 2-or 4-year program. Dropouts who had completed high school were just over one-third as likely as students who had never dropped out to be enrolled in a 2-or 4-year degree program (21 versus 60 percent; table 15).33 Among dropout completers, no differences were found in the proportions of students with diplomas or GEDs enrolling in the various types of postsecondary education (table 15).

"}, {"section_title": "SUMMARY", "text": "Dropouts may have chosen to leave school for a number of reasons. Most were having problems at or with school, such as getting poor grades or simply not liking school: more than three-quarters of dropouts (77 percent) cited a school-related reason for dropping out. However, some dropouts also had other underlying family or economic obligations associated with leaving high school (table 4). Once a student dropped out, however, the decision to return to complete his or her high school education was associated with several factors. First, dropouts whose families were in the middle or high SES quartiles were more likely to complete high school than those whose families were in the lowest quartile. Furthermore, completers were less likely than noncompleters to report job-related reasons for dropping out. Academics were also associated with completion. Dropouts achieving test scores in the highest quartile were more likely to complete high school than dropouts scoring in either the middle quartiles or low quartile, and dropouts who scored in the middle quartiles were more likely to complete than those with scores in the lowest test quartile. Finally, dropouts who had never had children or were expecting at the time of their first dropout event were more likely to complete high school than those who had children more than nine months after dropping out. Although dropouts who had completed high school diplomas and GEDs exhibited several similar tendencies, they were not entirely alike. Dropouts who had completed diplomas were more likely to have dropped out later in high school (i.e., in 11th or 12th grade) than other dropouts, whereas dropouts with GEDs were more likely to have dropped out in 9th grade. Also, although high test scores were more prevalent among both diploma and GED earners, grade averages of C's or better were more common only among dropouts who had completed diplomas. Closer examination revealed that even though dropouts who had earned GEDs may have scored in the high or middle test quartile, their grades were less likely to reflect the level of their test scores than those who had completed a diploma. In 1994, with secondary education over for all but the 24 percent of dropouts who were still trying to finish their diploma or GED and a fraction of stayouts who may decide to return to high school, most dropouts were working, looking for work, or keeping house. Approximately 26 55 percent of dropouts, however, most of whom had completed high school, had obtained some postsecondary education. Although 1988 eighth graders who dropped out tended to have different employment characteristics than those who had not, those who did not drop out and were not enrolled in a postsecondary degree program were different in only some respects from their dropout counterparts. Most notably, those who did not drop out were less likely than dropouts to have been unemployed in 1993. With regards to hours worked, income, and most types of occupation, the groups were indistinguishable. Based on the data reported here, there is not enough evidence to conclude that method of high school completion is associated with economic returns in the labor market after approximately two years out of school. This analysis would tend to support the assertions of King and other labor economists that the long-term impact of their education) investment cannot be determined at such an early date. Perhaps the economic returns of a diploma versus a GED is for dropouts who complete high school is an issue that should be revisited if further follow-ups to the NELS survey are conducted. Regardless of how one completes high school, years of education obtained has an impact on the long-term earnings potential of youth in the labor market. And for dropouts who do not continue their high school education, postsecondary opportunities are limited. Though high school completion enables dropouts to continue their education, a possibility many have thought about, a minority had done so as of 1994. Although table 16 reveals that 26 percent of dropouts expected their formal education to stop at high school, figure 7a demonstrates that among dropouts, about one in four attended postsecondary education by 1994. Furthermore, 11 percent of dropouts enrolled in a degree program, even though 34 percent expected to complete a bachelor's or advanced degree (figure 7a and table 16)."}, {"section_title": "APPENDIX A GLOSSARY", "text": "This glossary describes the variables used in this report.

If the comparison is between the mean of a subgroup and the mean of the total group, the following formula is used: Vses2,th + sew, 2p se sub where p is the proportion of the total group contained in the subgroup.38 (2) When comparing two percentages from a distribution that adds to 100 percent, the following formula is used:  where r is the correlation between the two estimates.39 The estimates, standard errors, and correlations can all be obtained from the DAS. There are hazards in reporting statistical tests for each comparison. First, comparisons based on large t statistics may appear to merit special attention. This can be misleading, since the magnitude of the t statistic is related not only to the observed differences in means or percentages but also to the number of students in the specific categories used for comparison. Hence, a small difference compared across a large number of students would produce a large t statistic. A second hazard in reporting statistical tests for each comparison occurs when making multiple comparisons among categories of an independent variable. For example, when making paired comparisons among different levels of income, the probability of a Type I error for these comparisons taken as a group is larger than the probability for a single comparison. When more than one difference between groups of related characteristics or \"families\" are tested for statistical significance, one must apply a standard that assures a level of significance for all of those comparisons taken together. Comparisons were made in this report only when p< .05/k for a particular pairwise comparison, where that comparison was one of k tests within a family. This guarantees both that the individual comparison would have p< .05 and that for k comparisons within a family of possible comparisons, the significance level for all the comparisons will sum to p< .05.40 For example, in a comparison of the percentages of students at risk to those not at risk who enrolled in postsecondary education only one comparison is possible (at-risk versus not-at-risk students). In this family, k=1, and the comparison can be evaluated without adjusting the significance level. When students are divided into five racial-ethnic groups and all possible comparisons are made, then k=10 and the significance level of each test must be p< .05/10, or p< .005. The formula for calculating family size (k) is as follows: 39Ibid. 46The standard that p<.05/k for each comparison is more stringent than the criterion that the significance level of the comparisons should sum to p<.05. For tables showing the t statistic required to ensure that p<.05/k for a particular family size and degrees of freedom, see Olive Jean Dunn, \"Multiple Comparisons Among Means,\" Journal of the American Statistical Association 56 (1961): 52-64. where j is the number of categories for the variable being tested. In the case of race-ethnicity, there are five racial-ethnic groups (American Indian, Asian/Pacific Islander, black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, and white non-Hispanic), so substituting 5 for j in equation 4, k = 5(5 1) =10 2"}, {"section_title": "Adjustment of Means to Control for Background Variation", "text": "Tabular results are limited by sample size when attempting to control for additional factors that may account for the variation observed between two variables. For example, when examining the percentages of those who completed a degree, it is impossible to know to what extent the observed variation is due to socioeconomic status (SES) differences and to what extent it is due to differences in other factors related to SES, such as type of institution attended, intensity of enrollment, and so on. However, if a nested table were produced showing SES within type of institution attended, within enrollment intensity, the cell sizes would be too small to identify the patterns. When the sample size becomes too small to support controls for another level of variation, one must use other methods to take such variation into account. To overcome this difficulty, multiple linear regression was used to obtain means that were adjusted for covariation among a list of control variables.'\" Adjusted means for subgroups were obtained by regressing the dependent variable on a set of descriptive variables such as parents' education, students' academic preparation, students' educational aspirations, etc. Substituting ones or zeros for the subgroup characteristic(s) of interest and the mean proportions for the other variables results in an estimate of the adjusted proportion for the specified subgroup, holding all other variables constant. For example, consider a hypothetical case in which two variables, raceethnicity and income, are used to describe an outcome, Y (such as attending a four-year college). The variables race-ethnicity and family income are recoded into a dummy variable representing race-ethnicity and a dummy variable representing family income: 41For more information about weighted least squares regression, see Michael S.
