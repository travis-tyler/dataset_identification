[{"section_title": "", "text": "Over the last two decades, two undisputed empirical features in the U.S. labor market are the overall rise in the return to collegiate attainment and the growth in the representation of foreign born among college-educated workers in the United States. The ratio of average hourly wages for college graduates relative to average hourly wages for high school graduates was 1.36 for men in 1978 and, a quarter century later in 2003, this ratio had risen to 1.77, an increase of about 29%. Despite considerable emphasis on the role of technological change as a determinant of the structure of wages and a substantial increase in the size of the federal budget for scientific research, college-educated workers in science and engineering fields have not received disproportionate wage gains over this period. At the same time the overall share of foreign-born among college-educated workers increased from 7.3 to 15% between 1980 and 2000 and, perhaps more dramatically, the share of foreign born-among doctorate holders under the age of 45 rose to 38% by 2000. A large share of the foreign born are trained in technical fields and work in science and engineering occupations. The statutory rules governing the allocation of visas to work in the U.S. explicitly favor those with at least a college degree with specialized knowledge in fields like engineering and the physical sciences through the H-1B provisions. 1 It seems plausible that the influx of foreign workers skilled in technical areas has depressed the labor market opportunities for U.S. natives, both lowering the earnings and discouraging many U.S. 1 H-1B visas are designated for those working in \"specialized occupations\" defined as \"requires theoretical and practical application of a body of specialized knowledge along with at least a bachelor's degree or its equivalent. For example, architecture, engineering, mathematics, physical sciences, social sciences, medicine and health, education, business specialties, accounting, law, theology, and the arts are specialty occupations.\" http://uscis.gov/graphics/howdoi/h1b.htm Completion of a PhD may be particularly important to an individual's prospects for receiving an H visa as educational requirements are one way for firms to document that an individual has skills that are scarce and specialized in the application process. The Immigration Act of 1990 allowed H-1B visas holders to also apply for permanent resident status, where formerly H-1B visa holders were required to declare an intention to return to their countries of residence. residents from pursing scientific careers (Freeman, 2005). At the same time, other groups with skills complementary to science and engineering are likely to have benefited from the expansion of the pool of labor with specialized skills in science and engineering. There has been little work that connects formal models of the impact of immigration to analysis of labor supply and wages in the U.S. science and engineering workforce, though there have been a number of papers focusing on the question of whether the growth of immigration among low-skill workers ties to the erosion of wages at the bottom of the income distribution. 2 In this work we start with simulation methods to gauge the possible effect of technically trained immigrants on the U.S. labor market. The methodology we follow is similar in flavor to work by Borjas, Freeman, and Katz (1992;1996) and more recently by Ottaviano and Peri (2005) that focus on the impact of foreign immigration into the U.S. on the labor market for high school dropouts. We begin with an overview of the changes in the representation of foreign born in the U.S. workforce, focusing particularly on changes among the highly educated and those employed in engineering and science occupations. We then use a simple model to simulate the effect of highly skilled immigrants on the labor market. We distinguish the supply of workers by skill, broad occupation, and immigrant status, in the context of a nested production function (similar to Ottaviano and Peri, 2005). We supplement the data available from the Census on the supply of skilled workers with data from U.S. and international 2 Some work by Borjas presents an exception. In a pair of papers he uses regression techniques to estimate both the impact of immigration on the earnings of U.S. PhDs (Borjas, 2005) and the extent to which foreign graduate students tend to crowd out U.S. students (Borjas, forthcoming). As Borjas acknowledges, there are some clear limitations to these studies. Borjas' estimates are identified off of assumptions that are hard to defend. For example, in his paper that looks at the effect of foreign immigrants into the U.S. on the earnings of PhDs, he assumes that cross field changes in the demand PhDs are uncorrelated with cross field changes in the number foreigners obtaining a PhD. Also absent from this empirical work is the incorporation of the impact of foreigners entering the U.S. labor market after completing PhDs abroad. sources on the production of post-secondary education at the undergraduate and graduate levels by field and country. Substantial aggregate demand shocks affecting the wages of college graduates relative to those with less education over the last two decades did not yield gains concentrated among those in the science and engineering sectors. 3 Given the emphasis in the literature on the importance of technology for explaining these trends, this seems puzzling. We will argue that an important part of the explanation is that substantial labor supply shocks concentrated in the science and engineering fields accompanied these demand shocks."}, {"section_title": "Section 1. Evidence on Immigration and Earnings in", "text": "The growth in foreign born workers among low-skilled workers over the last three decades in the United States has been widely discussed among labor economists (Borjas, 2003;Card, 2005). Among those age 25-34, the share of foreign born among those with less than a high school degree increased from less than 7% in 1970 to more than 40% in 2000 (Table 1). At issue in much of this research is how such large changes in the supply of low education workers affect wages received by native born and the overall structure of earnings. Notably, immigration is much less prominent in the middle of the education distribution: among high school graduates and college participants, the share of foreign born has increased though much less dramatically than among high school dropouts. Then, turning to college graduates, there are substantial gains in the representation of foreign born, rising from 6% of young workers in 1970 to about 16% in 2000 among those ages 25-34 (Table 1). Where part of the large increase in the share of foreign born high school dropouts reflects a decline in the number of native born dropouts (e.g., the number of U.S. born high school dropouts fell from 4.2 million in 1990 to 2.6 million in 2000 for those ages 25-34), the large increase in the share of foreign born among college graduates is driven entirely by increases in the number of college graduates from abroad. Notably, there are also dramatic differences in country of origin among immigrants at different ages and levels of education. Low-education immigrants are overwhelmingly from Latin America while immigrants with advanced degrees are more likely to come from Asia and Europe. 4 A closer look at the college-educated group -by degree and occupation -makes clear the bimodal nature of the immigrant expansion in the U.S. in recent decades. Table 2 shows the representation of U.S. born and foreign born college graduates by age and employment in a science and engineering occupation. While young foreign-born are about 13.5% of individuals working outside the science professions, this group accounts for 27.4% of those in science and engineering professions in 2000. What is notable are the quite large increases in the representation of foreign born among college-educated science and engineering workers between 1980 and 2000, rising from 10.8% to 27.4% for those ages 25-34 and increasing from 16.7% to 23.3% for those ages 35-44. The representation of foreign born declines somewhat in older age groups, though the foreign born group remains disproportionately concentrated in the science and engineering occupations. We note that foreign-born are disproportionately concentrated among doctorate recipients, for college graduates in general and those with occupations in the sciences in particular."}, {"section_title": "Doctorate recipients in science and engineering", "text": "Looking directly at the representation of those with doctorate degrees in the U.S. labor force. Table 3 illustrates the concentration of foreign born in the highest education category, particularly among the youngest workers. Note that when we examine counts by degree level our observations are limited to the two most recent Census enumerations (1990 and 2000) where educational attainment is recorded in terms of degree attainment. We present estimates for 1980 based on adjustments to the 1990 data to reflect age at degree receipt (calculated from the Survey of Earned Doctorates) and immigration between 1990 and 1980. Across age groups, there is a large shift from the cohort ages 45-54 in 1990 (55-64 in 2000) where only about 17% of PhD recipients are foreign born to the cohort 35-44 in 2000 where nearly 36% of PhD recipients are foreign born. Within scientific occupations, the representation of foreign born in young cohorts is yet larger, with 44.2% of PhDs ages 25-34 foreign born and 55% of PhDs 35-44 in 2000 from countries outside the U.S. In absolute terms, the number of foreign born PhDs ages 35-44 more than doubled between 1990 and 2000 (rising from 23,164 to 54,695) while the number of U.S. born in this category increased more modestly from 42,461 to 69,819. The implication of these changes is that the immigration of high skill workers has markedly changed the supply of this group, in turn affecting overall earnings through movement along the labor demand schedule. 5 One factor in the growth of the representation of foreign-born workers in science and engineering fields is the dramatic rise in the representation of non-U.S. residents among PhD recipients from U.S. universities. Students from outside the U.S. accounted for 51% of PhD recipients in science and engineering fields in 2003, up from 27% in 1973. In the physical sciences, engineering and economics the representation of foreign students among PhD recipients is yet more striking; among doctorate recipients in 2003, those from outside the U.S. accounted for 50% of degrees in the physical sciences, 67% in engineering and 68% in economics (see Figure 1). Foreign-born students have been represented at U.S. graduate schools throughout the post-World War II era; still, the last quarter century has been distinguished by a rise in the share of degrees awarded to students born outside the U.S., particularly in scientific fields (Figure 1). Within science fields, the growth since the mid-1970s in doctorates awarded among those from outside the United States is particularly striking. With some modest differences in timing across fields, the expansion in degrees awarded to foreign born commenced in the mid-1970s and slowed in the mid-1990s. Summarizing the broad developments from 1980 to 1996 (the peak year in recent PhD awards to foreign students), the total number of PhDs in science and engineering increased from 12,126 to 21,253. If we engage in the accounting exercise of holding constant the foreign share at the 1980 level, the total expansion in doctorates awarded would have been expected to be a more modest 2,619 degrees relative to the observed change of 9,127 doctorate degrees awarded by U.S. institutions. Bound, Turner and Walsh (2005) argue that much of this growth can be explained by the dramatic growth in the number of foreigners, particularly among students in Asia, with adequate preparation for pursing a science or engineering PhD in the U.S. Examining the trends in undergraduate degree attainment in European and Asian countries since 1975, shows that since 1985 there has been substantial growth in undergraduate degree attainment abroad relative to the U.S., reflecting the shrinking of birth cohorts in the US (and to a lesser extent the UK). 6 What is more, growth in BA degree attainment in Korea and China has been substantial greater than other countries, reflecting transformations in the local educational institutions in the recent decades (see Bound, Turner, and Walsh, 2006). The overall growth and the change in country of origin among PhD recipients from U.S. universities between 1980 and 1996 (the recent peak in doctorates awarded in science and engineering) is shown in Figure 2. Representation of students from India, Asian countries and Eastern Europe increased over this interval. Most markedly, students from China increased from little participation in U.S. educational institutions in 1980, to nearly 13% of doctorate recipients in science and engineering in 1996. 7 While the China case is the most extreme, there is clear evidence that an important determinant of this expansion of foreign participation in U.S. graduate education is the relative expansion in demand among students from abroad as changes in BA degrees awarded, particularly in scientific fields, produced increased demand for doctorate education in the U.S. As such, this growth should be considered largely exogenous to labor market developments in the U.S. 6 The decline in the number of Science and Engineering bachelor degrees being awarded in the U.S. that started in the mid 1980s is due entirely to the shrinking size of cohorts. On a per-capita basis the fraction of college age individuals receiving a science or engineering BA degrees continued to rise after the mid 1980s. 7 The influx of students and those trained in science and engineering from China beginning in the early 1980s is a dramatic transformation and, perhaps, the change in the data closest to an exogenous shock. During Mao's \"Cultural Revolution\" from 1966 to 1976 university activity and scholarly exchange with the U.S. was largely disrupted. The establishment of diplomatic relations with the United States in 1979 dramatically changed the level of educational exchange with China. China sought to jump start its development process through access to science and engineering technology through U.S. university education and, at least initially, most students and scholars visiting the U.S. from China came on J or exchange visas. A disproportionate share of the first wave of exchange students coming to the U.S. were related to high-level Chinese officials, including the son of Deng Xiaoping and the son of the Foreign Minister (Wong, 1981), though there was also considerable competition among U.S. universities to identify the most talented among the Chinese students. While the increase in the representation of foreign-born among doctorate recipients from U.S. universities over the last quarter century is significant, many foreign-born workers among the highly skilled enter the U.S. having completed graduate study abroad. Indeed, a substantial number of foreigners first enter the U.S. as post doctoral scholars (National Academy of Sciences, 2005). 8 While systematic data on the number of such individuals is not available, there is a good deal of evidence that the magnitude of such flows is substantial. Tabulations from the Census show that close to 20% of foreign born PhDs in the U.S. as of 2000 had immigrated within the last four years, too short a time to obtain a PhD. Another indicator of the substantial inflow of foreign-educated is that the ratio of doctorates awarded by U.S. institutions to individuals from foreign countries is often well-below the number of foreign born doctorates recorded for the same cohort in the decennial Census. For individuals born between 1955 and 1959, the representation of doctorate holders in the 2000 Census exceeded PhDs awarded by U.S. institutions for those born in many foreign countries, with ratios of 1.8 for Germany, 1.4 for France and 1.5 for India, implying that the U.S. is a net importer of doctorate-level workers from these countries. 9 Bringing together data on PhDs awarded in other countries, PhDs awarded to foreign students by U.S. universities and the year of immigration of doctorate recipients (Figure 3), it is clear that the dynamic leading to the increased representation of foreign-born among the supply of doctorate recipients in the U.S. goes beyond the award of doctorates and differs appreciably by country of origin. In this figure, data on PhDs awarded by U.S. institutions are arranged by year of graduate school entry so as to best correspond to year of immigration. 10 For the European countries and India, it is clear that, on net, the U.S. imports PhDs since the stock of PhDs measured in the Census exceeds measures of doctorates awarded by U.S. institutions. For the Asian countries, doctorate recipients from U.S. universities were, historically, more numerous than PhDs from these countries in the U.S. labor force. One point of note from Figure 3 is that for a number of the countries shown it would appear that there are sharp increases in immigration of PhDs in the years immediately before the 2000 Census. While the period of high demand for skilled workers in the late 1990s is one explanation for this trend, we suspect that another dimension of this empirical result is the observation that much of the flow of PhDs from abroad in the U.S. labor market is transitory not permanent. To illustrate, we looked at the counts by country of origin in the 1990 and 2000 Census enumerations by country of origin. If immigration was a once and for all choice, data on PhDs from 1990 would resemble data for 2000 (less an adjustment for mortality). Yet, when we count PhDs by country among those coming to the U.S. between 1987 and 1990 in both the 1990 and 2000 Census files, we get the following tabulations: 11 In all but the case of India, there are appreciably fewer PhDs represented a decade later in 2000 than in 1990. We infer that the positive number for India reflects the observation that many students from India (who had not yet received PhDs from U.S. institutions) were enumerated in 1990. The demand for post-doctorate scientists and engineers in the U.S. may induce many PhDs from abroad to come to the U.S. for relatively short-term employment. With international market. To this end, it is likely that the supply of talent to the U.S. is much more elastic than one would surmise from consideration only of the production of scientists by U.S. universities; we note that this circumstance is much different than the status quo in the late 1960s and early 1970s when both production and employment of PhDs was more tightly concentrated in the United States. Further, limited evidence on the timing of immigration suggests that there is considerable international mobility over the course of the life-cycle, with many doctorates working in the U.S. for relatively short periods of time. 12 Our objective in the remainder of this analysis is to estimate the effect of the growth in supply of highly-skilled workers generated by immigration on the wage structure in the United States. We begin with a consideration of the observed changes in the structure of wages and then turn to simulations estimating the impact of immigration on the structure of high skill wages."}, {"section_title": "Section 2. Structure of Wages in the Science -Engineering Labor Market", "text": "It is well-known that the overall return to education increased substantially through the 1980s and into the 1990s and skill biased technological change, with demand shocks favoring college-educated, is a frequently cited explanation (Bound and Johnson, 1992;Katz and Murphy, 1992). Over the last quarter century, economists have paid particular attention to the possibility that many technological inventions such as the introduction of the computer may favor relatively well educated workers. Computing technologies are likely to substitute for manual labor (by replacing relatively menial tasks that were once performed by unskilled workers) while serving as a complement to another kind of labor (by enhancing the productivity of workers with relatively high levels of skills), resulting in a rise in the relative wages received by those with a college degree. 13 While there is substantial evidence of changes in labor demand favoring college graduates over high school graduates in recent decades (Autor and Katz, 1999), there is little evidence to suggest that, among college graduates, those with advanced training in science and engineering benefited disproportionately. Examination of the trends in the labor market rewards for PhD scientists in the U.S. relative to other high-skill workers over the last quarter century suggests that the relative returns to advanced study in the sciences have not increased. Earnings of those early-career advanced degrees in the sciences have actually decreased in relation to the earnings of other college-educated workers, with the latter having risen overall in the last two decades as is well-known. 14 Figure 5 shows the trends in faculty salaries by field for those within ten years of doctorate receipt, from 1973 to the present. The dashed line represents the corresponding 13 Using data from the October Current Population Survey, Autor, Katz, and Krueger (1997) estimate that the share of workers using a computer at work rose from 25.1% in October 1984 to 46.6% in October 1993. The gains in computer usage were particularly marked for college-educated workers, rising from 42.1% in 1984 to over 70% in 1993. Autor, Levy, and Murnane (2003) find compelling evidence that technical change and increased use of computers serve to substitute for routine manual and cognitive tasks, while complementing non-routine problem solving skills and explaining a substantial share of the relative demand shift favoring college educated workers from the 1970s to the mid-1990s. 14 Our data on the earnings of early career advanced degree recipients in the sciences come from two sources, which tell similar stories. First, the Survey of Doctorate Recipients is a stratified random sample of PhD recipients from U.S. universities across potential cohorts and provides earnings observations in odd years from 1973 to 2001, with data from the precursor National Register of Scientific and Technical Personnel providing evidence from 1958 to 1970. In addition, the Faculty Salary Survey series provides salaries by field and rank for public universities. trend for BA recipients (ages 25-34) more generally, calculated from the CPS. To be sure, real earnings of doctorate level scientists have increased over the last decade. Yet, as indicated by the relationship of the dashed line to the field-specific series, the increases in the earnings of scientists have risen less rapidly than BA recipients more generally, with the exception of the physical sciences where the changes are near equal. In all of the broad science fields, the average annual rate of growth in academic salaries at public universities is less than 2% in both the 1980s and the 1990s. In comparison, the rate of grown in real earnings across all young workers with a BA degree was about 2.6% from 1994 to 2003. 15 In effect, scientists employed in academics have done less well than college-educated workers more generally in the last decade. What is striking is that growth in the earnings of new advanced degree recipients in science and engineering fields in the last two decades is muted relative to the overall market for college-educated workers. In contrast, during the scientific boom years of the late 1950s and the early 1960s, the increases in the salaries of scientists with advanced degrees tended to outstrip overall changes in the returns to education ( Table 5, Freeman 1975;1976). One explanation for the observed changes in the structure of wages for highlyskilled workers is that the labor market drew in lots of foreign-trained scientists, in addition to retaining a number of foreign students educated in the U.S. Where the supply of those trained at the highest level in science and engineering disciplines in the United States might have accurately been described as inelastic in the short-run during the 1960s, this structural feature of the science and engineering labor market appears to have eroded. As such, our hypothesis is that the science and engineering labor market is much more internationally integrated now than three decades ago. The result is that changes in the labor demand for scientists are much more likely to be accommodated in the near term. Moreover, it is also likely that labor supply shocks in the form of an influx of highly trained foreign scientists overlaid other transformations in the structure of wages during the last two decades."}, {"section_title": "Section 3. Estimates of the Effect of Immigration on the Structure of Wages for High Skill Workers", "text": "The model motivating our estimates follows a nested CES production function, focusing on workers in science and non-science professions (where, in a similar setup, Card and Lemieux distinguished between college-educated and high school educated). The aggregate production function is: As we are interested in the wages of college-educated workers in the science relative to college-educated outside of science and engineering occupations, we put aside other factors and focus on the implied change over time: which assumes no changes in relative efficiency parameters. We consider projections with various assumptions about the elasticity parameters. For 1980For -1990For and 1990For -2000 is evaluated using several different assumptions. First, we examine the projections based on observed changes in S and N, and the cohort-specific dimensions of these dimensions of labor supply. Then, we consider the projected change in wages when the number of foreign college graduates is set at the 1980 level. Then, we consider an alternative simulation in which there is a supply response among U.S. residents graduating from college (not yet incorporated in the tables that follow). To calculate this supply response we assume that immigration has no effect on the number of U.S. residents finishing college, but that the relative wages in science and non science occupations affect both the fields U.S. residents major in and the occupations they end up in."}, {"section_title": "Substitution between high skill foreign and U.S. workers", "text": "It is theoretically plausible that foreign-born and U.S. born PhD recipients (and college graduates with expertise in science more generally) are not perfect substitutes in the U.S. labor market. Ottaviano and Peri (2005) and, somewhat earlier, Jaeger (1996) raise this question and consider the empirical evidence, focusing at least in part on relatively low-skill educational groups, where it seems likely that language barriers and culturally-specific human capital may affect substitution. Our specific concern is whether U.S. and foreign high skill workers are imperfect substitutes. We examine regressions of relative wages on relative quantities for U.S. and foreign PhD recipients in the sciences, with this setup following from the proposition of yet another \"nest\" in the CES production function. In Table 6, we present regressions of relative wages on relative supply among foreign and U.S. PhDs over the 1990-2000 interval (PhDs are only identified in the two most recent Census iterations). What is unambiguous in these estimates is that the coefficient of interest in these regressions is indistinguishable from zero (and actually positive in sign) implying that the elasticity of substitutions for these groups is close to infinite. 16"}, {"section_title": "Relative wage effects in the science-nonscience market for college graduates", "text": "Our main focus is on the relative of earnings of those in science and engineering occupations relative to non-scientists among college graduates. In this context, we examine expected changes in relative wages assuming different elasticities of substitution (Table 7), as well as allowing for imperfect substitution across age groups (Table 8). To calculate the effect of immigration on the relative wages of college graduates in scientific and engineering occupations, we compute the expected change in relative wages (following (1)) with the observed decennial changes in relative supplies and a counterfactual change with the supply of foreign-born restricted to prior levels. It is the difference between these projected changes in relative wages that presents a back of the enveloped calculation of the expected 16 Ottaviano and Peri (2005, Table 4) regress relative US / foreign wages on relative supplies in aggregate and for four education groups (high school drop outs, high school graduates, some college and college plus) across the five decennial enumerations . Ottaviano and Peri use decennial changes in immigrants as an instrument for relative supply; their preferred specifications suggest an elasticity of substitution of about 5. We note, as do Ottaviano and Peri, that these general estimates are quite sensitive to specification choice. One might go further to suggest that if, as we suspect, the overall process of \"selection\" of foreign born high skill workers into employment in the U.S. has changed over time that it will be very difficult to recover the \"true\" substitution parameter from aggregate regressions using variation over time. effect on wages due to immigration. Since these calculations ignore domestic supply responses, they should be seen as upper bound on actual effects. What our calculations suggest is that, the influx of foreign born workers substantially altered relative wages between science and non-science occupations. For the 1980s these effects seems to be concentrated among those 23-34 years old. For the 1990s, the effects are much more wide spread. In computing these estimates, we have assumed that the supply of U.S.-born workers among the highly educated in science and engineering is exogenous. Such an assumption would seem problematic when examining the effect of highly skilled immigrants on the wage structure. Indeed, there is a long literature dating back to Freeman's PhD thesis that emphasizes the endogeneity of enrollment decisions in higher education. Yet, the mechanism through which supply response and substitution occurs is likely to be considerably more complicated than changing occupational choices among future college graduates."}, {"section_title": "Supply shocks in the market for PhDs", "text": "The growth in the concentration of highly-skilled foreigners among doctorate recipients, particularly in science and engineering, leads to the specific examination of the role of immigration in this corner of the labor market. Of course, because PhDs are by definition very specialized degrees, substitution between science and non-science PhDs would seem to be minimal. A PhD in English is unlikely to be a viable substitute for a PhD in physics and vice versa. We turn our attention to the question of how the change in supply of PhDs over time generated in part by immigration affects expected wages.  Table 9 presents calculations of the wage change following from the observed change in the level of all PhDs and S&E PhDs and calculations that hold the level of foreign doctorates at their 1980 and 1990 levels. The difference between these predicted wage changes is the estimated effect of the change in immigration on the wages. We present these calculations with the stocks of doctorate recipients calculated from the Census, with the labor force in each category defined in terms of counts of individuals with wage and salary earnings. 17 In using occupational codes to distinguish science and engineering workers, we recognize that this is likely to be an overly narrow definition of the pool of doctorates with training in science and engineering fields while the aggregate pool of doctorate recipients is likely too broad. Using Census estimates, we project that the downward effect of the immigration of highly educated in science and engineering on the wages of PhDs in these fields was on an order of 15% to 12% in the 1990 to 2000 period (and 6.3% to 5% for all PhDs) with generous elasticity estimates of 2.5 to2. [Freeman (1975[Freeman ( , 1976 places estimates of 1/\u03c3 in the range of .40 to .44, implying elasticities of between 2.3 and 2.5, forming the basis of our preferred predictions. The table presents estimates with alternative choices ranging from 1 to 3.] Given that the growth of immigrants among the pool of doctorate recipients is relatively recent and concentrated among younger workers, it is worthwhile to reconsider these estimates in the context of a setup allowing for imperfect substitution among age groups. Initially, we employ an elasticity of substitution between age groups of 5. Table 10 presents computations specific to age groups of the expected changes in wages associated with supply changes over the two decades from 1980 to 2000 for science and engineering PhDs and shows the expected change in relative wages attributable to immigration of foreign PhDs. The magnitude of the expected change varies inversely with the elasticity assumption, but even with quite large elasticities the effects of immigration are far from trivial. In the interval from 1980 to 1990, immigration accounts for a decline in relative wages of about 9-12% for all age groups in the science and engineering PhD workforce (with the preferred elasticity choices of 2.5-2). In the next decade from 1990 to 2000, the magnitude of the predicted declines in wages increases particularly for those in the relatively young age bracket while immigration continues to account for a substantial predicted relative wage decline. These calculations are done using the observed change in the number of U.S. born PhDs and varying the change in the number of foreign-born PhDs between 0 and the observed level. As such, the calculation ignores that fact that the effect that foreign labor has on U.S. earnings will have an impact on the flow of U.S. residents into science and engineering PhD programs. In the future we will allow for such adjustments in our calculations. Doing so will, to some extent, mitigate the effect of foreign immigration on the U.S. wage structure. However, since flows (new PhDs) will always be small in comparisons to stocks, we strongly suspect that, in qualitative terms, our simulations that take into account U.S. residents supply adjustment will look quite similar to the ones we present here."}, {"section_title": "Section 4. Conclusion", "text": "Even with quite substantial assumed elasticities, our rudimentary simulations suggest that the influx of foreign born had substantial effects on the wages of college-educated workers in the sciences and, presumably, also affected entry into these fields. Moreover, while research funding expanded significantly in the 1980s and 1990s ( Figure 6), PhD wages did not rise as they did during the prior boom of the 1950s and 1960s. Analysis of the science and engineering labor market of the 1960s and 1970s found considerable empirical support for cob-web cycles in the labor market, with changes in labor market demand resulting in sharp fluctuations in wages. Boom periods led to substantial increases in the returns to science, where declines in funding brought about sharp downturns, resulting from the relative inelastic supply of scientific labor associated with the long time lag to doctorate production (see, for example, Blank andStigler, 1957 andFreeman, 1975). Yet, funding increases for science in the 1980s and 1990s did not lead to sharp increases in wages for scientists. 18 While it is undisputed that college-educated workers gained relative to workers with less education in recent decades, neither broad changes in technology including the growing use of computers nor direct increases in the demand for research and science appear to disproportionately increase the earnings of college-graduates 18 Goolsbee (1998) asserts that the supply of scientific and engineering personnel has been quite inelastic over the past quarter century and, as a result, increased R&D spending leads to higher wages for scientists. While Goolsbee (1998) presents regressions of wages for scientific personnel on R&D spending, such estimates are likely to dramatically overstate the effect of R&D spending on the wages of scientists if such changes in funding are correlated with secular changes in wages to the college-educated in this period. employed in the sciences. There is, nevertheless, positive link between research and development funding relative to GDP and earnings of scientists and engineers; yet this link is yet stronger for BA degree recipients more generally and those designated as serving in managerial occupations. 19 One hypothesis to be explored in future work is the extent to which increases in the supply of skilled workers in science and engineering from other countries serves to increase the productivity and wages of other professional and managerial workers. Supply shocks generated by the expansion in the number of highly skilled workers from abroad served to offset changes in demand. Simulations using plausible parameters suggest that the supply shock was big enough. An implication is that cobweb models and those that predict large wage gains to the science and engineering workforce in response to demand shocks are less likely to account for changes in the structure of wages as the skills and educational attainment of workers from outside the United States have grown over the last three decades.  1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 Year  1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 Year  1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 Year  1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 Year of PhD"}, {"section_title": "Number of Degrees Awarded", "text": "Non U.S. U.S. Total"}, {"section_title": "Economics", "text": "Source: NSF, Survey of Earned Doctorates microdata.
