[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "As the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continues, there is a pressing need for the development of effective vaccine candidates. According to the World Health Organization, as of the end of August 2020, there are more than 30 candidate vaccines in clinical evaluation and 140 candidate vaccines in preclinical studies [1] . SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding and entry is initiated upon the interaction of the protruding virion-associated spike (S) glycoprotein with the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on target cells, primarily in the lower respiratory system [2] .\nStudies have shown that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein is highly specific and is an immunodominant target for neutralizing antibodies [3, 4] . Many candidate vaccines currently Membranes 2020, 10 in clinical development have incorporated RBD as the target antigen. Further, it has been established that the spike protein ectodomain results in trimerization, and this has paved the way for vaccine development efforts targeting the trimeric spike protein [5] [6] [7] . However, studies to date have not yet investigated the role of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein transmembrane domain (TMD) in protein trimerization. While previous work has demonstrated that the TMD of SARS-CoV, the etiologic agent responsible for the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic, is highly conserved [8] , and important for membrane fusion and cell-cell fusion activity [8, 9] , it remains unclear whether the SARS-CoV-2 TMD plays any role in trimerization. Interestingly, Tai et al. showed that the recombinant receptor-binding domain of MERS-CoV when expressed in a trimeric form induced a potent neutralizing antibody response in vivo and protected transgenic mice from MERS-CoV infection [10] . Thus, determining analogous strategies to induce SARS-COV-2 spike RBD trimerization may have a notable impact on vaccine development, especially since more than 15 vaccine platforms, currently in development, are based on the RBD. Herein, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 TMD induces trimerization of the spike RBD, which may be an important consideration for platforms that are making vaccines using the RBD as an immunogen."}, {"section_title": "Cell Culture", "text": "HEK293T (CRL-3216), Vero (CCL-81), and U-2 OS (HTB-96) cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collections (Manassus, VA, USA).

To examine the contribution of the TMD to spike trimer formation, a chimeric construct was made by fusing the TMD to the RBD (henceforth referred to as RBD-TMD). This construct was expressed in HEK293T cells and cell lysates were resolved using SDS-PAGE. Interestingly, in the absence of protein denaturation heat treatment, we observed an expected robust band at 25 kDa that corresponds to the monomeric chimeric RBD construct, but also a 75 kDa band, as well as the presence of a faint, high molecular weight band at 150 kDa (Figure 2A) . We postulated that these higher molecular weight bands are the result of trimerization (75 kDa) or oligomerization (150 kDa) of RBD-TMD.\nMembranes 2020, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 8 a chimeric construct was made by fusing the TMD to the RBD (henceforth referred to as RBD-TMD).

We postulated that these higher molecular weight bands are the result of trimerization (75kDa) or oligomerization (150kDa) of RBD-TMD. We next investigated the effect of thermal denaturation on the occurrence of the 75 kDa band. Heat treatment of the sample eliminated the 75 kDa band in the SDS-PAGE gel (Figure 2A ). The RBD-TMD was also analyzed by native PAGE with and without thermal denaturation to explore the role of proper protein folding on the occurrence of the 75 kDa band. Under native conditions the relative intensity of the 75 kDa band was increased in comparison to the monomeric band at 25 kDa, and, similarly to the SDS-PAGE analysis, the larger band disappeared with heat treatment ( Figure 2B ). To determine whether it was the RBD or the TMD that was responsible for the occurrence of the 75 kDa band, the native PAGE analysis was repeated using the RBD alone ( Figure 2C ). Without the TMD, the presence of the 75 kDa band was largely diminished. This indicates that the larger band is not due to an interaction between the RBD and another protein, and that the RBD, by itself, lacks the capacity to facilitate trimerization.\nNext, we sought to investigate whether the RBD-TMD trimerized protein complex retains RBD's antigenic and functional conformation. Therefore, we constructed an attenuated vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing RBD-TMD to evaluate the conformation of the construct as a potential antigen encoded in a vaccine vector. Dot blot analysis revealed that both neutralizing antibodies targeting conformational epitopes in the RBD ( Figure 3A ) and mouse sera targeting spike ( Figure 3B ) recognized the RBD-TMD construct. These data suggest that the RBD-TMD trimer retains the antigenic conformation of the RBD. In addition, we also examined the capacity of RBD-TMD to interact with ACE2 Membranes 2020, 10, 215 5 of 8 using dot blot analysis ( Figure 3C ). Our results demonstrate that RBD-TMD binds ACE2-pointing to the fusion protein's maintained capacity to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 host cell receptor.

Indeed, this Many of the known vaccine platforms currently in development target the RBD of spike. Given our findings, we speculate that developing a vaccine which targets a chimeric RBD-TMD may be more effective in inducing protective immunity rather than targeting RBD alone. This finding is corroborated by past coronavirus vaccine initiatives, such as in the case of a MERS-CoV vaccine study. In that study, a chimeric RBD fused to a foldon trimerization motif elicited stronger neutralizing antibody responses and better lethal challenge protection than the comparable RBD-only vaccines [10] ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Our data indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 virus TMD induces trimerization of RBD and emphasize the importance of investigating a chimeric RBD that includes the TMD of SARS-CoV-2 as a potential immunogen for vaccine development, or in anti-viral strategies targeting the RBD in SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, considering the hidden nature of the spike TMD and therefore the unlikelihood of it operating as a robust immunogen, we speculate that the employment of specific allosteric modulators of the TMD may be ideal. These allosteric modulators could include antibodies, recombinant antibody derivatives, or small molecule compounds that would bind to the ectodomain of spike and induce a conformational change that would render the TMD incapable of trimerization [15] [16] [17] .\nGiven that many vaccines currently in development target RBD, we believe that it is necessary to have a holistic understanding of the mechanisms underlying the virulence capacity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Knowing that the TMD plays a critical role in the trimerization of spike preceding viral entry may now prompt new research streams aiming to tease apart the intricacies of these mechanisms in an effort to therapeutically target them. Coupling the targeting of trimerization with current anti-RBD strategies may yield a synergistic anti-viral strategy.\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at http://www.mdpi.com/2077-0375/10/9/215/s1.
