[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Twenty percent of children in the United States under the age of 18 now live with at least one foreign-born parent (Hernandez et al, 2007). Studies have revealed inconsistent outcomes, where immigrant students (as compared to native students) sometimes thrive and sometimes struggle within the educational system (Noguera, 2004). Contradictory findings highlight the complexity of the school experience for immigrant students. Both factors intrinsic to the immigrant group and those resulting from broad social processes in the host society drive the likelihood of educational success. In particular, immigrants' education, occupational skills (human capital), and cultural patterns (values and attitudes toward education), the structure of immigrant communities (social and ethnic capital) and external factors such as local contexts of reception affect children's educational outcomes (Gibson, 1987;Massey, 1990;Duran & Weffer, 1992;Hayes, 1992;Kao & Tienda, 1995;Portes & MacLeod, 1996;Zhou, 1997Zhou, , 1999Rumberger & Larson, 1998;Pong et al, 2005;Pong & Hao, 2007). Because studies show that parents' attitudes and behaviors influence student achievement, and since parental immigration status is more influential than that of the child (Kao & Tienda, 1995;Kao, 2004), we pay particular attention to the immigrant generation status of parents, comparing children whose parents were born outside of the United States and immigrated before the age of 17, those whose parents immigrated after the age of 17, and those whose parents were born in the United States. We believe that this comparison provides a clearer picture of the processes of immigrant acculturation and its consequences for educational success across time. In this article, we focus on the educational achievement of two immigrant groups in the United States -Chinese and Mexican students. These two ethnic groups are very different in terms of their demographic characteristics, the circumstances of their immigration experiences, and the historical patterns of reception and incorporation in the United States. We believe that a detailed examination of the parental practices that shape their educational success (or lack thereof) in American schools sheds light on the disparate processes driving immigrant children's experiences and provides insights for policy. We examine the educational experiences of these students during the elementary years, analyzing the first-and fifth-grade waves of data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K), a large, nationally representative database. We assess the relationships between parental educational expectations, various parental practices during first grade, and fifth-grade mathematics and science achievement. We focus on mathematics and science achievement because these are among the core curricula in elementary school and remain so in high school and beyond (Crosnoe, 2005(Crosnoe, , 2006. Also, mathematics and science skills are crucial for opportunities for advanced course taking in high school that opens doors for post-secondary education. Further, in the case of immigrants, mathematics and science skills should most accurately measure students' ability and be less affected by their English proficiency than reading-achievement outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Theoretical Background", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Chinese and Mexican Immigrants in the United States", "text": "The historical differences in the paths of immigration to the United States between Chinese and Mexicans are vast. First, different immigration policies towards these groups were in place for much of the twentieth century; second, the local receptions to Mexicans and Chinese immigrants have varied tremendously; third, each group travels considerably different distances to the United States; and fourth, the size of the immigrant enclaves these groups encounter upon arrival in the United States varies significantly. We discuss the likely effects of these differences between Chinese and Mexican immigrants below. In the early twentieth century, the Chinese Exclusion Act was in effect, but Chinese immigrants arrived in the United States in large numbers to work on the railroad and in the gold mine industry in the West beginning in the mid nineteenth century (Hirschman & Wong, 1986). After the repeal of this act in 1943, Chinese came to the United States mainly as a result of family reunification (Nee & Nee, 1986). A new wave of Chinese immigration began with the Immigration Act of 1965 when nationality quotas were thrown out. These newcomers came with relatively high levels of human capital: 64% had at least a Bachelor's degree (only 4% were lacking a high school degree) and almost half occupied professional positions (Lobo & Salvo, 1998;Jensen, 2001). While the Chinese are often considered 'model minorities' (Kao, 1995), they have historically been subject to considerable discrimination in the United States because of the sheer distance between their culture and that of the new country: Confucianism and Buddhism, an ideographic written language, and Asian-phenotypic physical distinctions starkly contrast with European populations, which has no doubt affected the ease with which the Chinese have been subsumed into American society. Mexican immigrants, on the other hand, have resided in California and the American southwest for hundreds of years and, to some extent, have moved freely back and forth across the border as a result of Mexico's close proximity to the United States. Research shows little upward mobility among these 'old-generation' Mexican Americans, who, on average, do not achieve parity with non-Hispanic whites (Allensworth, 1997). Lacking educational credentials, they were historically employed in the lowest-paying blue-collar jobs; they experienced discrimination and exploitation, lacking both political power and social status (Lopez & Stanton-Salazar, 2001). It follows that the path of Mexican newcomers since the 1960s has reflected the political, economic, and social conditions of the pre-existing ethnic community. Thirty years later, in the mid 1990s, 42% of native-born and 59% of foreign-born Mexican children lived in poverty; 66% of native-born and 79% of foreign-born Mexicans were without health insurance coverage; among individuals 24 and older, 37% of native-born and 70% of foreign-born Mexicans lacked a high school diploma, while 11% and 4%, respectively, had a Bachelor's degree (Jensen, 2001). Foreign-born Mexicans are among the least-educated immigrant groups in the United States and, not surprisingly, are concentrated in low-skill, low-paying jobs (Crosnoe, 2006;Waldinger & Reichl, 2006). The educational and occupational status of Mexican immigrants stands in stark contrast to that of Chinese immigrants, who arrived with relatively high levels of human capital. The rate and extent to which these two groups have acculturated also reflects the distance that each group has traveled to reach the United States. Mexican immigrants are more likely to experience transnational migration patterns as a result of Mexico's proximity to the United States; hence, there is a more realistic opportunity for return to the home country, so one may be psychologically more apt to retain native cultural orientations. Chinese immigrants, on the other hand, travel thousands of miles and therefore may feel more motivation to acculturate more fully to US norms and behaviors as a result of the economic costs associated with a return to China (Hirschman & Wong, 1986). Alba & Nee (1997) argue that Asian immigrant groups were assimilating into the American mainstream more rapidly than European immigrants both culturally and economically around the turn of the twentieth century. Further, unmeasured, potentially beneficial non-cognitive traits may characterize those individuals migrating a greater distance (Borjas, 1987;Jasso & Rosenzweig, 1990). Finally, the greater relative numbers of Mexican immigrants to the United States has meant that a larger ethnic enclave existed for newcomers to exploit; and the sharing of resources among a greater number of newcomers could have potentially dispersed already limited financial, social, and ethnic capital. However, for Chinese immigrants, the size of the enclave has historically been smaller, potentially concentrating resources for fewer newcomers. This increases the opportunity for parents to transfer wealth and other advantages to their offspring (Hirschman & Wong, 1986). Indeed, researchers have shown that Chinese children in particular tend to succeed academically, in some cases outperforming native white students (Portes, 2000;Pong & Hao, 2007). For all the reasons listed above, one would naturally expect disparate patterns of assimilation in the United States. Thus, we examine parental practices and achievement patterns of Chinese and Mexican immigrants, not only because they are currently among the largest groups in the post-1965 wave of immigration to the United States, but also because the relationship between their different group-specific characteristics and experiences may shed light on the factors that shape the adaptation of immigrants in the United States."}, {"section_title": "Educational Achievement of Immigrant Children", "text": "Segmented assimilation theory suggests that the host country presents immigrants with several competing possibilities for acculturation and assimilation, where at least three outcomes are expected. First, they may assimilate to the mainstream middle-class culture; second, they may experience downward assimilation, joining the underclass; and third, they may adopt middle-class behaviors and lifestyles while preserving their cultural identities (Portes & Zhou, 1993;Zhou, 1997Zhou, , 1999. The path that a member of an immigrant family follows depends on factors related to the individual and his/her pre-migration status, the immigrant group's intrinsic characteristics, and the host society's broader social processes. Researchers have identified several factors that play a role in the educational achievement and attainment of immigrant children. Country of origin bestows various resources on an individual arriving in the United States, as detailed above. Parental educational, occupational, or professional status and income level have been shown to significantly affect immigrant children's educational achievement in different countries, and the socio-economic circumstances of immigrant families vary dramatically (Duran & Weffer, 1992;Haveman & Wolfe, 1995;Kao & Tienda, 1995;Portes, 1995;Portes & MacLeod, 1996;Rong, 1998;Rumberger & Larson, 1998;Schnepf, 2004;Bodovski & Benavot, 2006). With respect to the effects of the length of immigrants' residence in the host country, two contradictory approaches have been identified. The first approach, often referred to as the straightline assimilation framework, predicts that over time or across generations, ethnic and racial minorities will eventually blend into mainstream culture and become indistinguishable from the native population in terms of educational achievement (Gordon, 1964). This would reflect immigrant families' accumulation of human and financial capital, and it is assumed that firstgeneration immigrant children will have lower educational attainment, but that this will improve with time or over subsequent generations. In contrast, a second approach, the accommodation-without-assimilation hypothesis, suggests that recently arrived immigrant children will have higher academic achievement. This viewpoint predicts that first-generation immigrant children are well positioned to achieve scholastically, because they have not been affected by 'negative' elements in some native peer cultures (Kao & Tienda, 1995). Further, Kao & Tienda (1995) offer the 'immigrant optimism' hypothesis as an explanation for the superior performance of more recently arrived immigrants. The strong underlying optimism of immigrant parents, many of whom are unaware of structural barriers in a host society and perceive educational attainment as a central avenue of upward economic and social mobility, is thought to translate into high scholastic expectations, which, in turn, drive strong achievement among immigrant youth. Additionally, with second-generation immigrant students' reported higher English proficiency, they appeared to be the best positioned to succeed educationally. Kao & Tienda conclude that since parental optimism plays such an important role in children's educational outcomes, the immigration status of the parents is more influential than that of children. Within this framework, the immigrant parents' desire to preserve their unique cultural values is considered a crucial factor (Gibson, 1987;Duran & Weffer, 1992;Portes, 1995). Similarly, Portes & Rumbaut (2001a), using data from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study (CILS), consistently find that more recently arrived students have higher expectations and higher performance levels than those with more accumulated time in the United States. Further, prior research has found that second-, third-, and higher-generation students generally have lower academic performance than first-generation students (Kao & Tienda, 1995;Portes, 1995;Rumbaut, 1995;Portes & MacLeod, 1996;White & Kaufman, 1997;Portes & Rumbaut, 2001b;Rumbaut & Portes, 2001;Glick & White, 2003). Yet, these findings are surprising, since first-generation students have less experience in the American educational system, do not typically come from Englishlanguage backgrounds, and often have families with lower than average socio-economic status (SES) -factors that are typically positively related to achievement."}, {"section_title": "Parental Practices and School Success", "text": "Family SES is reproduced across generations through various cultural and social resources and practices. Cultural resources refer to family-based cultural traits such as work habits and basic learning orientations, prevailing cultural norms, values, and attitudes, and parenting styles and practices (Bowles & Gintis, 1976;Bourdieu, 1986;Lamont & Lareau, 1988;Farkas et al, 1990;Farkas, 1996Farkas, , 2003Lareau, 2000Lareau, , 2003Farkas & Beron, 2004). Many ethnographic studies have stressed the impact of cultural values (Gibson, 1987;Duran & Weffer, 1992) and cultural knowledge (van Zanten, 1997) on the educational success of immigrant youth. In her early work on parent-school relations, Lareau (2000) argues that middle-class parents possess cultural knowledge about the structure and the content of the educational system, confidence in approaching teachers, and the financial resources necessary for making themselves available at school, which results in a greater advantage for their children as compared to working-class parents. According to Lareau, these different parenting strategies and children's experiences result in a sense of entitlement among middle-and upper-middle-class children, versus a sense of constraint among poor and working-class children. Thus, from a very young age, children in middle-class families learn cultural codes, styles, and ways of speech and behavior that facilitate successful integration into social institutions such as the school, while working-class children lack these cultural skills and experiences (Lareau, 2003;Lareau & Weininger, 2003). A rich literature examines the effects of parental practices on various academic outcomes. Parental involvement at school has been found to positively affect achievement (Stevenson & Baker, 1987;Rumbaut, 1994;Muller, 1995;Portes, 1995;Hanson et al, 1997). Children benefit academically when there is a close partnership between parents and schools, and the effects cover a variety of positive outcomes, such as improved homework and study habits, better attitudes toward school, low absenteeism and graduation (Epstein, 1987(Epstein, , 1995(Epstein, , 2001Stevenson & Baker, 1987;Lareau, 2000). Ho Sui-Chu & Willms (1996) suggest that parental involvement is not a onedimensional concept; instead, it consists of four substantively different dimensions: home discussion, school communication, home supervision, and school participation. The authors discuss both the determinants and consequences of each dimension and conclude that 'parental involvement made a unique contribution to explaining children' academic achievement, over and above the SES effects' (Ho Sui-Chu & Willms, 1996, p. 138). Other studies have looked at the effects of parents enrolling their children in extra-curricular activities on educational achievement and attainment. While studies on older students have produced mixed results as to whether extra-curricular activities matter for college attendance (Kaufman & Gabler, 2004), studies on young children have shown rather positive effects. Dumais (2005Dumais ( , 2006 found that the number of activities in which children participated during kindergarten and first grade positively affected their reading scores and teacher evaluation of mathematics skills, where participation seemed to especially benefit students with a lower SES. The aforementioned studies focused on white and black students; thus, it is still an empirical question whether similar patterns can be found in immigrant families. Regardless of economic resources, recent immigrants do not immediately enter the mainstream culture or necessarily adopt different child-rearing practices. Further, it is not clear whether abandoning the old practices and adapting to new, 'appropriate' parental behavior would result in better educational outcomes for immigrant children. In this article, we conduct a detailed examination of the role that country of origin and immigrant parents' generational status plays in the manifestation of these parental behaviors, and we explore the relationship between different aspects of parental behavior and practices and children's outcomes. Specifically, we examine the educational achievement of Mexican and Chinese immigrant children and estimate its relationship to the generational status of their parents: parents migrating to the United States when they were children or teenagers, parents migrating at the age of 17 or older, and native-born parents. We are particularly interested in the associations between parental educational expectations, cultural practices, and school achievement, and we focus on mathematics and science performance at the end of the fifth grade. By doing so, we assess the educational experience of immigrant children in the crucial, influential years of elementary school. Fifth grade is a particularly critical year, since in the subsequent middle grades children begin streaming and differentiating into a curriculum that predicts access to later coursework essential to college entry."}, {"section_title": "Hypotheses", "text": "Based on the above review of the literature, we propose the following hypotheses: 1. Chinese and Mexican parents' levels of school involvement, extra-curricular enrollment, and provision of books will increase as their time in the United States increases; in other words, native-born Mexican and Chinese parents will have higher levels of parental practices than the more recently arrived parents, controlling for family socio-economic background. 2. Higher levels of parental practices will have a positive association with children's fifth-grade mathematics and science achievement.  "}, {"section_title": "Data and Measures", "text": "The data for this study come from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K). The ECLS-K contains longitudinal assessments of student performance as well as measures of family context and socio-economic background collected during parent interviews (National Center for Education Statistics, 2000). In addition, the restricted-use files contain parental reports of specific native background and country of birth (National Center for Education Statistics, 2002). From the originally sampled 21,260 kindergarten students, we restricted our attention to all students whose parents reported the child was Mexican or Chinese or that one or both parents were born in Mexico or China in the spring first-grade questionnaire and, for comparison, all those whose parents reported in the baseline questionnaire that the child was white, non-Hispanic, and who reported in the spring first-grade questionnaire that they themselves were born in the United States (i.e. all non-immigrant whites). This selection resulted in an analytic sample size of 13,020. [1] We examine the differences between Mexican, Chinese, and white students in order to explore patterns among immigrant groups in the United States who have particularly disparate immigration backgrounds and how this variation relates to variation in achievement outcomes. Further, we use native-born whites as the reference group in the analyses, because they currently represent the dominant demographic in the United States, and their practices are often (intentionally or not) held as the ideal to which immigrant groups should acculturate."}, {"section_title": "Variables", "text": "The primary dependent variables of interest were fifth-grade mathematics and science item response theory (IRT) scores. [2] Ethnicity and immigrant status. As described above, we restricted our analyses to Mexican, Chinese, and white, non-Hispanic families. Furthermore, we explored differences in outcomes according to immigrant status. Using parents' reports of the age at which they arrived from the spring first-grade questionnaire (supplemented with the spring fifth-grade questionnaire if this information was missing in the first-grade wave), we separated parents into three groups [3] -parents arriving before the age of 17, parents arriving at the age of 17 or older, and parents born in the United States -which yielded seven dichotomous indicators of combined ethnicity/immigrant status: Mexican students with parents arriving before the age of 17; Mexican students with parents arriving at the age of 17 or older; students with native Mexican parents; likewise for Chinese students; and, finally, white students with native-born parents only. [4] The cut-off age of 17 was chosen because prior research suggests the importance of differentiating immigrant status according to whether someone migrated to the United States as a child or adult (see, for example, Rumbaut & Ima, 1989;Portes & Rumbaut, 1996). Socioeconomic status. We employed three measures of SES from the first wave of data collection. First, we used the highest level of education reported in the composite education variable for either parent. The dummy categories included: less than high school diploma, high school diploma, some college including a two-year or technical degree, college graduate, and, finally, a graduate or professional degree. Second, income is the composite annual household income reported. Third, we used a measure of occupational status representing the average of the mother and/or father's occupational prestige score, computed by averaging the corresponding prestige score of the 1980 census occupational category codes covered in the ECLS-K parental occupations (Nakao & Treas, 1992). While these three SES variables are strongly related, we control for each separately because, among some immigrants, prior education received in a foreign country may not translate into the occupational status or income generally associated with the same attainment achieved in the United States (van Tubergen et al, 2004). Family structure. We created three dichotomous measures of family structure as measured at the beginning of kindergarten, including two biological parents, single-parent family, and other family structure, which includes: biological parent with step-parent, adoptive parent(s), related guardian(s), and unrelated guardian(s). Two-biological-parent family serves as the reference group in all analyses. In addition, we include a continuous measure of the number of persons in the household from the fall kindergarten questionnaire, intended to capture both sibship size and the potential dispersion of household resources. Home language. We included a measure of the home language of the child created from two indicators from the kindergarten wave of the ECLS-K, one based on the school report of the child speaking a minority language and one based on the parental report of the language used at home. Non-English was coded as 1, English as 0. Parents' educational expectations. As student achievement is often driven by the attitudes of parents, and parental expectations regarding children's achievement are likely to be related to parenting practices, we included a measure of the parents' expectations for their child's ultimate educational attainment. This variable is a six-point scale ranging from 1 = will not complete high school to 6 = Medical Doctor (MD), PhD or other higher degree, and it was recoded so that zero was the base category. This variable was taken from the initial wave of data collection in the fall of kindergarten, since in later years this variable may be endogenous to prior student performance. Parental practices. We examined three dimensions of parental practices. The first dimensionparental involvement in school -is a six-item summed scale from the parent questionnaire of the spring of first grade, including: whether the parent ever attended an open house at the school; whether the parent attended parent-teacher association/organization meetings; whether the parent had attended a school or class event (for example, a school fair or play); whether the parent had volunteered at the school or served on a committee; whether the parent had participated in a fund-raising event at the school; and whether the parent had gone to a regularly scheduled parentteacher conference. Respondents answered either 'yes' or 'no' to these questions. The second dimension -extra-curricular activities -was measured using seven dichotomous items from the parent questionnaire of the spring of first grade concerning participation in the following activities: dance lessons; athletic activities; organized clubs or recreational programs (for example, scouts); music lessons; arts or craft lessons; organized performance groups (for example, choir or theater); and trips to the library. Additionally, in the spring kindergarten parent questionnaire, parents indicated whether in the past month the child had visited a museum, a zoo or aquarium, or had gone to a concert. The range for this dimension was 0 to 10. [5] The final dimension of parental practices is the reported number of children's books at home from the parent questionnaire from the spring of first grade. This measure is a strong indicator for the importance the parent places on the provision of a cognitively rich environment. Prior research suggests that the importance parents place on providing books is also often highly correlated with children's language abilities (Heath, 1983;Hart & Risley, 1995;Senechal & LeFevre, 2002;Cheadle, 2008). All three parental practice dimension scales were converted to z-scores in the regression analyses, although raw scores are presented in the descriptive analyses. The Cronbach's alpha for the domains of both school involvement and extra-curricular activities was 0.6."}, {"section_title": "Analytic Procedure", "text": "As with most survey data, some cases did not have complete data on all variables. As a result, we employed a multiple-imputation procedure to estimate responses for missing values (imputed values were not used when the variable was modeled as the outcome). We used IVEware in SAS (Raghunathan et al, 2002), and the analyses suggested that data missingness satisfied the missing at random (MAR) assumption necessary for multiple-imputation methods (Allison, 2002). The five data sets created in IVEware were accordingly analyzed using the micombine procedure in Stata, which calculates standard errors appropriate for multiply imputed data sets (Rubin, 1987). We first regressed our primary variables of interest -each of the three parental practice dimensions -against all background variables to explore whether there are differences according to ethnic immigrant group, net of socio-economic background, family structure, language background, and parents' educational expectations. We then regressed the final outcome variables of interest -fifth-grade mathematics and science achievement -on the demographic background variables, parents' expectations, and parental practices. [6] For the regression analysis, all continuous variables were standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 for greater ease in interpreting coefficients across models. Dichotomous ethnic immigrant group variables were not standardized, so coefficients may be read as standard deviation unit changes in the dependent variable among any given group. Table I shows the means and standard deviations for all analysis variables for each ethnic group by the age at which they arrived in the United States. We found that educational attainment, financial resources, and occupational status varied widely between Mexicans and Chinese. Among the most recently arrived Mexican parents, nearly 50% had not graduated from high school. For those arriving before the age of 17, the proportion without a high school diploma was 35%, and for native-born, 14%. In contrast, only 12% of the most recently arrived Chinese lacked a high school diploma, and fully 29% had a graduate degree compared to 2% of the most recently arrived Mexican parents. Notably, as the amount of time spent in the United States increased, the rate of graduate degree receipt dropped off among Chinese parents, yet for Mexicans, educational attainment increased -for example, among those arriving after the age of 17, 4% had a Bachelor's degree while 12% of native-born Mexicans had graduated from college."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The patterns for family income and occupational status were similar, but unlike educational attainment, Chinese income and occupational status tended to increase with the amount of time spent in the United States, similar to Mexican families. It is interesting to note that among nativeborn Chinese, the rates for college degree attainment, income, and occupational status all exceeded the rates for native-born whites. There was a higher proportion of biological two-parent families and the lowest proportion of single-parent families among the Chinese, compared to all Mexican immigrant groups and native-born whites. Also, native-born Chinese had adopted English at a higher rate than native-born Mexicans, i.e. 8% versus 20% speak a language other than English at home. Concerning educational expectations, both Chinese and Mexican parents of all immigrant groups, including native-born, reported higher expected educational outcomes for their children relative to whites and, notably, expectations decreased as the amount of time in the United States increased among both Chinese and Mexicans. Further, the mean levels of parental practices also uniformly increased with the amount of time spent in the United States. Multivariate analyses will confirm whether these patterns hold net of other socio-economic characteristics. Note. Final sample sizes were rounded in compliance with the National Center for Education Statistics guidelines regarding presentation of restricted-use data. Table I. Means (standard deviations), for all analytic variables by ethnicity and immigration arrival status (n = 13,020). Table II presents the regressions with standardized coefficients for the first dimension of parental practices -school involvement. Model 1 presents the total association between this dimension and each ethnic immigrant group, controlling for sex. Mexican parents of all generational groups reported lower levels of involvement relative to native-born whites. Chinese parents who arrived in the United States after the age of 17 reported lower levels, as well. However, school involvement for Chinese parents who arrived before the age of 17 and those born in the United States was essentially the same as for native-born whites, on average. Model 2 additionally included each SES indicator, and each coefficient was significant and in the expected direction, with greater resources, both educational and financial, associated with greater school involvement. However, once these variables were included in the model, the coefficients for each ethnic generation group decreased to the point where the difference between native-born Mexicans relative to whites disappeared. This pattern holds in Model 3, where each family structure variable was added, and we found that being in a larger, non-two-parent household was further negatively associated with levels of parental involvement at school. In Model 4, where home language was added, the coefficient for Mexicans arriving before the age of 17 becomes statistically equal to that for whites, yet the coefficients for both Chinese and Mexicans arriving as adults remained negative and significant. Model 5 included parents' educational expectations, and, notably, the negative coefficients for these latter two groups became larger, suggesting there is a positive relationship between expectations and school involvement for these groups. In the end, only 20% of the total variation in school involvement is explained by the variables in these models, implying that much of what drives school involvement concerns factors besides SES, family structure, language familiarity, or parental attitudes about school. Comparison group is two parents. Table II. Regression (standardized coefficients) of school involvement on immigrant status, socio-economic status, family structure, language, and educational expectations (ECLS-K; n = 10,370). Next, we regressed extra-curricular activities on ethnic immigration status and family background. Comparison group is two parents. Table III. Regression (standardized coefficients) of extra-curricular activities on immigrant status, socio-economic status, family structure, language, and educational expectations (ECLS-K; n = 10,020). Model 2 added the set of SES variables, and once these were added, the difference between nativeborn Mexicans and whites disappeared, but a negative relationship for Chinese parents immigrating as adults became negative and significant. This suggests that by virtue of their relatively higher SES, more recently arrived parents of Chinese students were able to provide extra-curricular opportunities for their children. These same relationships held in Model 3, which additionally included family structure. As with school involvement, there were no differences between either child-immigrant groups or native-born Chinese and native-born whites on the dimension of extracurricular activity participation with family structure controlled. Model 4 included language background, which suppressed the negative association between this dimension and being either a Chinese or Mexican adult immigrant, as their coefficients became stronger once a non-English language at home was controlled. The same was true for parents' educational expectations in Model 5, as this variable further suppressed relatively lower levels of extra-curricular activities. The results in Model 5 of Table III also mirrored those for school involvement, where the positive relationship between parental educational expectations and extra-curricular involvement became greater with the addition of this variable. This indicated that higher educational expectations were related to higher participation in such activities, at least among the adult-immigrant ethnic groups relative to whites. For all other groups, levels on this dimension were essentially equal to those for native-born whites. Table IV shows the regression results for the final dimension of parental involvement -the number of children's books at home. Model 1 indicates that Mexican and Chinese immigrant parents provided fewer books than white native-born parents, with the exception of Chinese native-born parents. Part of this disparity, at least within Mexican families, was their relatively lower SES, since we see in Model 2 that a great deal of the difference was mediated by income, education, and occupational status. However, for Chinese families, much of the difference did not appear to be related to SES. With the addition of family structure in Model 3, the disparity grew among both Chinese and Mexicans relative to whites, suggesting that two-biological-parent families were apt to have more books. Model 4 included home language, and its addition reduced the disparities across all groups to some extent. Model 5 added parents' educational expectations, yet many of the differences between the ethnic generation groups and whites that were apparent in Model 1 persisted. Further, the R-square term with all variables entered was only 0.08, leaving the vast majority of the variation in immigrant parents' provision of books unexplained by ethnic background, socio-economic resources, family structure, language familiarity, and orientations towards educational attainment. Comparison group is two parents. Table IV. Regression (standardized coefficients) of number of books on immigrant status, socio-economic status, family structure, language, and educational expectations (ECLS-K; n = 10,360)."}, {"section_title": "Academic Achievement", "text": "The next set of regressions explored the relationship between immigrant background and fifthgrade mathematics achievement. The models in Table V proceeded exactly as in prior regressions; however, the final model included the parental practices domains. We found that boys scored higher in mathematics on average, and with respect to the total ethnic/immigrant differences (Model 1), we found that all Mexican groups scored significantly lower than whites (approximately four-fifths of a standard deviation lower than whites among Mexican students with adultimmigrant parents), while Chinese students whose parents arrived as adults scored on average over half of a standard deviation higher than whites. Neither native Chinese nor Chinese students whose parents arrived before adulthood scored significantly different from whites. Comparison group is two parents. Model 2 included controls for socio-economic background, and the inclusion of these variables significantly reduced the disparity between Mexican groups and whites, but increased the difference between Chinese students whose parents arrived after adulthood and whites. The family structure variables in Model 3 were associated with mathematics achievement in expected ways, with children from larger, non-two-biological parent households performing significantly lower, net of SES and ethnic background. Further, the addition of family structure and family size again reduced the differences between both Mexican and Chinese children and whites. Controlling for English-language background reduced the disadvantage for Mexican students with both child-and adult-immigrant parents by approximately one-third. Yet, its addition significantly increased the advantage Chinese students with adult-immigrant parents had over white students. Given that immigrant parents have been shown to have higher educational expectations for their children, it is not surprising that its entry into the equation (Model 5) showed a suppressor effect for differences across all Mexican immigrant groups relative to whites, so that the disparity between groups became even greater. For the Chinese, its addition yielded a smaller advantage relative to whites. Finally, Model 6 introduced the parental practices variables, and each related to mathematics achievement in expected ways: each had a positive association with the outcome and their inclusion somewhat shrank the disadvantage for whites but increased the advantage for Chinese. With all variables included, the disadvantage among Mexican students relative to whites persisted, although the greatest difference -that among students with adult-immigrant parentswas 0.20 standard deviation units. Further, the advantage among Chinese students with adultimmigrant parents was the strongest remaining association at almost three-quarters standard deviation units. Table VI presents the final set of regressions, showing fifth-grade science achievement. By and large, the patterns of findings are similar to those found for mathematics achievement and, for space considerations, we do not discuss them here in detail. Comparison group is two parents.

Regression of fifth-grade science achievement (standardized coefficients) on demographic variables and child and parent background measures, ECLS-K (n = 7400)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We have used a large, nationally representative database (ECLS-K) to examine the mathematics and science achievement of two large immigrant groups in the United States -Chinese and Mexican students. We assessed the effects of parental educational expectations, as well as various parental practices during kindergarten and first grade, on fifth-grade mathematics and science achievement. We gave particular attention to immigrant generation status by comparing children whose parents were born outside of the United States and immigrated after the age of 17, those whose parents immigrated before the age of 17, and those whose parents were born in the United States. Our findings support the first hypothesis that Chinese and Mexican parents' levels of school involvement, the extra-curricular activities they choose for their children, and the provision of children's books at home will increase as their time in the United States increases. Indeed, our results suggest a pattern of increasing assimilation with respect to parental practices with time spent in the United States. The findings regarding these practices among those who immigrated as adults suggest evidence of existing cultural variation in practices above and beyond that attributable to their SES. That is, children's extra-curricular participation, parents' involvement at school, and the number of children's books at home differ greatly between recently immigrated parents and non-immigrant whites, even after controlling for family SES. However, the differences in parental practices between immigrant Chinese and Mexican parents and white parents become smaller with the amount of time parents have spent in the United States and, in the case of Chinese native-born parents, differences disappear completely. This is consistent with Kao's (2004) findings, which report that foreign-born parents of US-born Asian American children were more similar in their parental practices to white parents and differed from foreign-born parents of foreign-born children, suggesting a process of acculturation. As with parental practices, we found diminishing differences between immigrant minorities and white students across generations in students' science and mathematics achievement. Mexican students whose parents immigrated as adults show significantly lower achievement, and this disadvantage relative to white students decreased with immigrant generation and became insignificant for those with native-born parents. On the other hand, Chinese students whose parents immigrated as adults exhibited higher performance compared to white students, and this advantage disappeared with immigrant generation. In sum, these patterns suggest a process of increasing assimilation among immigrant families, where the amount of time spent in the United States is associated with decreasing immigrant-white achievement differentials. We believe that our findings support the segmented assimilation framework, highlighting the complexity of factors, both intrinsic to the immigrant group and related to their modes of incorporation in the host society, which shape the educational achievement of immigrant children. Our findings provide partial support for the second hypothesis. Although all three dimensions of parental practices had a positive association with student achievement, given the different patterns of immigrant achievement by generational status and ethnicity discussed above, we cannot conclude that assimilation of parental practices uniformly benefits immigrant children. In addition, recently immigrated parents likely employ different practices and techniques with their children beyond the scope of our study. We looked at various parental activities, structuring of children's extra-curricular time, parental involvement in school, and the number of children's books at home. Other factors may play a role in children's educational outcomes. For example, studies on Asian parenting styles introduce the concept of 'training' (Chao, 1994(Chao, , 2001. This idea refers to a complex set of activities and modes of behavior employed by parents (mostly mothers) in order to 'train' a child to be a successful member of society (both cognitively and socially). Prior studies have also examined decision-making processes, conversational patterns, and closeness between immigrant parents and their adolescent children (Kao, 2004;Pong et al, 2005). Future studies may look at conflict resolution and discipline strategies employed by immigrant parents and expand the aforementioned studies to younger children. Prior research has shown that more recently arrived immigrants have higher expectations regarding their children's success in the educational system because they may be less cognizant of existing structural barriers in the new country, and they perceive education as the main avenue for upward mobility (Ogbu, 1991;Kao & Tienda, 1995). Our findings clearly support the implications of the 'immigrant optimism' hypothesis. More recently arrived Mexican immigrant students' and Chinese immigrant students' achievement benefits from parents' reported higher educational expectations for their children. Our findings suggest that recently arrived immigrant parents have a relatively positive perception regarding their place in the American social structure, and thus regarding the opportunities available to their children. Decreasing expectations across generations may signal some disenchantment within the immigrant experience. However, it may also demonstrate immigrant parents' more realistic views regarding their children's educational attainment, which again may be an indication of cultural convergence and assimilation into the American mainstream culture."}, {"section_title": "Notes", "text": "[1] Due to random sample attrition by the fifth-grade wave, the analytic sample sizes vary, since we did not impute missing values for the dependent variables. [2] The average age for the fifth-grade assessment was 11.2, so most students were in fifth grade, although approximately 16% were behind the grade for their age. [3] The country of birth was determined from the report of either parent if the parent(s) was classified as an immigrant, but when determining whether an immigrant parent arrived as an adult, both parents had to have arrived at the age of 17 or older. To be classified as native-born, both parents needed to have been born in the United States. [4] In other analyses not shown here, we examined the sensitivity of different age-at-arrival cut-offs, in particular, age 15, 16, and 18. No substantive differences were found. We chose 17 as the cut-off for two reasons. First, theoretically speaking, arrival before the age of 17 implies that these individuals were more likely to have enrolled in an American school as a result of legal statutes requiring enrollment of children aged 16 or younger. Since much socialization occurs in school, differentiation of the likelihood of this experience may reveal meaningful differences in individuals' orientation towards expected parental practices. Second, the selection of age 17 also provided the most robust sample sizes for ethnic generational groupings. [5] Although some of these 10 items come from measures taken at two different time points, all were measured well before the outcome measures of interest. Further, we do not propose a relationship between fifth-grade achievement outcomes and potential changes in these items occurring between kindergarten and first grade; thus, we feel this procedure is justified. [6] All regressions were performed in Stata using the cluster command, which calculates standard errors appropriate to the school-stratified cluster sampling design of the ECLS-K."}]
