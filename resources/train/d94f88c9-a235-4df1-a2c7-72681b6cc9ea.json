[{"section_title": "", "text": "Technology Adoption, Management Practices, and Financial Performance of New and Beginning Farmers: Evidence from a National Survey The population of U.S. Agriculture is poised to make a dramatic change-more than 50 percent of current farmers (over 55 years) are likely to retire in the next five years (Mishra and El-Osta (2) beginning farmer and rancher contract land sales program; and (3) reservation of funds for direct operating loans for beginning farmers and ranchers. Finally, currently the Farm Credit Administration (FCA) is seeking lending rule changes to aid new and beginning farmers and ranchers. The FCA is investigating if off-farm income can be used to finance farm investment decisions. New and beginning farmers and ranchers (YBFR) have different needs than established farmers and ranchers. YBFR often lack the capital and the scale of operation to make profits and face high production costs (due to high cost technologies and production systems). A YBFR must rapidly acquire information about how to farm, how to manage a farm business, and how to adhere to regulations. Hence, the objective of this paper is to: (1) assess the uses of technology, in particular the adoption of GM crops; (2) use of input management practices and information systems; (3) labor allocation decisions; and finally (4) investigate the factors (farm, operator, and household characteristics, along with farm type, and regional location of the farm) affecting profitability of new and beginning farmers and ranchers A better understanding of the characteristics that influence returns and/or profits would be useful to YBFR who wish to make changes in their farming operations in order to increase returns, and to policymakers who aim at formulating policies that help YBFR maintain stable incomes."}, {"section_title": "Defining New and Beginning Operators", "text": "New and beginning farm operators can be defined in a variety of ways depending on the reasons for which analysis may be conducted. Sociological studies may define new and beginning by generational differences says by twenty year age bands. Studies related to eductional services may group new and beginning operators by \"high school\", \"college student\" and \"post graduate\". New and beginning farm operators are often defined by eligibility status in some farm programs. Widely used is a definition \"any individual or entity who has been operating a farm or ranch for less than 10 years and materially participates in its operation.\" This is the definition used for participation under the Conservation Security Program (CSP) and the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). A second widely used definition is the Farm Service Agency (FSA) definition. For paticipation in farm ownership and operating loan programs, a beginning farmer or rancher must have an operation that is no larger than 30% of the average size farm in the county. A further requirement, for direct operating loan participation, requires that the applicant must have participated in the business operation for at least 3 years. The issue of the financial health and success of new and beginning farm operators is especially pertinent for farmers who are ready to retire within the next five years. Their retirement will have implications for farm wealth, industry structure, and the supply of food and fiber. Using the 2005 ARMS, farm operators have been classified into two categories based on their experience as a primary farm operator. The first category includes farm operators who have ten years or more farming experience (about 80 percent of farm operators). Second are farm operators who have less than ten years experience (about 20 percent of operators). Our study focuses on the latter group of farm operators and their households."}, {"section_title": "Data Source for New and Beginning Operators", "text": "Data for this analysis are from the 2005 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS)."}, {"section_title": "ARMS is conducted annually by the Economic Research Service and the National Agricultural", "text": "Statistics Service. The survey collects data to measure the financial condition (farm income, expenses, assets, and debts) and operating characteristics of farm businesses, the cost of producing agricultural commodities, and the well-being of farm operator households. The target population of the survey is operators associated with farm businesses representing agricultural production in the 48 contiguous states. A farm is defined as an establishment that sold or normally would have sold at least $1,000 of agricultural products during the year. Farms can be organized as proprietorships, partnerships, family corporations, nonfamily corporations, or cooperatives. Data are collected from one operator per farm, the senior farm operator. A senior farm operator is the operator who makes most of the day-to-day management decisions. For the purpose of this study, operator households organized as nonfamily corporations or cooperatives and farms run by hired managers were excluded. The 2005 ARMS collected information on farm households in addition to farm economic data. For example, it collected detailed information on off-farm hours worked by spouses and farm operators, the amount of income received from off-farm work, net cash income from operating another farm/ranch, net cash income from operating another business, and net income from share renting. The heavy emphasis in off-farm employment of operators and spouse by suggests that the farm household has an alternate goal to generating maximum household income for the farm business operation 2 . Furthermore, income received from other sources, such as disability, social security, and unemployment payments, and gross income from interest and dividends was also 2 With a growing rural population, many of whom are defined as \"farmers\" within the definitions which apply to USDA's agricultural surveys ($1,000 in sales for a \"normal\" year), we obviously begin to find more \"lifestyle\" farmers. \"Lifestyle\" farmers have alternative farming goals: as opposed to farming for profit they may farm for other amenities of a rural lifestyle such as placing high value on clean air, less noise, open spaces, and less congestion. To have these farmers grouped within the same group with farmers who are in business to farm for profit is discordant. While the objective of this paper is not to look at the relationship between farm business goals and profitability it is important to recognize that alternate goals exist within the principal categories selected for analysis. Income statements comparison by operator experience: Experienced primary farm operators yielded average net farm income about 3.5 times larger than new and beginning operators. Generally, new and beginning operators had lower relative sources of gross cash income, and "}, {"section_title": "Methodology and Model Specification", "text": "The appropriate measure of economic performance has been a topic of much interest among both economists and accountants. Some would argue that accrual net farm income (before taxes) is a good measure of overall financial performance while others suggest that return to labor and management is the preferable measure. Yet other researchers have used several financial ratios to measure farms= financial performance (e.g. Plumley and Horbaker; Ellinger et al.). Kauffman and Tauer used four different measures of farm performance for their study (labor management income per operator, labor management income per operator per cow, rate of return on equity capital, and rate of return on equity capital excluding appreciation). Financial Performance is a subjective term and depends in part upon the time frame considered and the goals of the farm business and/or farm household. Therefore, the criteria by which farm performance is measured must be clearly defined. Several studies have investigated the use of net farm income (NFI) as a performance measure (Melichar; Haden and Johnson). The benefits of using NFI, as a measure of profitability, have been well-documented in past studies (Lins et al.). A positive value of NFI is critical to survival of the farm. Most farmers must balance equity growth with the need to meet short-term cash commitments. The use of NFI as a sole performance measure, however, may present a problem because it is an accounting measure and does not address opportunity costs. Hence, the use of NFI as an economic performance measure does not necessarily accurately reflect use of the resource base. In addition, the measure is a dollar amount and as a result is difficult to compare across farm businesses. Also, the form of business organization (family owned, corporation, etc.) can cause interpretation problems. In light of the above problem, following Mishra et al, 1999 we use modified net farm income (MNFI) per dollar of assets as a measure of financial performance."}, {"section_title": "Conceptual Framework", "text": "Consider a profit maximizing farm operator who in each period selects the combination of inputs and outputs that maximizes profits (total revenue minus total cost) subject to a production constraint. Specifically, where \u03a0 is net profits (net farm income), i P denotes a vector of output prices, and i Q denotes a vector of output produced. Production depends on the farm operator's level of human capital (education and experience), price of output, various farm characteristics, and managerial ability. On the cost side, j C represents the cost of production, which depends on the quantity produced ( j Q ), a vector of input prices j w , and a vector of farm characteristics, and managerial ability, \u03b8 . Based on equation 1 one can estimate the following model where NFI is net farm income and X ij is a vector of farm, operator, and financial characteristics. However, because net farm income does not address opportunity costs as a measure of financial performance we replace the dependent variable (NFI) in equation 2 with modified net farm income (MNFI) per dollar of assets. MNFI is defined as net farm income (NFI) plus interest expense, where NFI is gross farm income minus total farm operating expenses, excludes marketing expenses (Mishra, El-Osta, Johnson, 1999). MNFI_DA is defined as the ratio of MNFI to total assets. MNFI_DA is hypothesized to be a function of operator and farm characteristics and management strategies used to manage the farm. Specifically, we estimate the following equation using a weighted least squares procedure. MNFI_DA is modified net farm income per dollar of assets, X ij are a set of farm operators=, farm, and financial characteristics, \u03b1 ij is a vector of parameters to be estimated, and, \u03b5 is the unexplained random component. The independent variables hypothesized to affect the farm=s financial performance encompasses the three following areas: farm operator characteristics; farm characteristics such as production and marketing efficiency measures; and management strategies. They are presented in Table 1. The inclusion of farm operator characteristics such as education may give some insights into the influence of training, experience, and demographics on farm business financial performance. These factors affect the production function (Huffman, 1977;Becker). Huffman (1977)   Barlett's notion that larger and more resource endowed farms are better able to take advantage of sophisticated, productivity-enhancing technology and ultimately more likely to generate higher incomes. Managerial ability has been included in a number of studies of producers. Managerial ability has been represented in regression models by a set of demographic variables or production practices (Sumner and Leiby; Mykrantz et al.). Managerial practices in general have been found to be important to the success of farming operations (Sonka et al.). Mishra, El-Osta, and Johnson, found that farmers who adopt a proven technology (operators willing to try a new technology even though it has been tried by only few operators in the county) are more likely to be successful in farming."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The Agricultural Resource Management Study (ARMS) is a probability weighted random survey and in order for the estimated parameters to be reflective of the farming population a weighted least squares method of estimation was used. Weighted least squares estimates of factors hypothesized (equation 3) to affect the financial performance of new and beginning farm operators, as measured by MNFI per dollar of asset is presented in Table 2. The R 2 (adjusted) of 0.30 in Table 3 indicates that the explanatory variables used in the weighted least squares equation explained 30 percent of the variation in returns to operators' labor and management. These levels of explained variation in Table 2 are fairly typical when the analyses are based on cross-sectional data (El-Osta and Johnson; Hensher and Johnson). The F-statistic, which tests the joint significance of the independent variables included in the model, is significant at the 1 percent level of significance ( Table 2). The coefficient on technology adoption (T_GMSEED) is positive and statistically significant at lower than the 10 percent level of significance. have separate funds dedicated to assist YBFR. However, in all of the cases the authorities require that the farm operator have a business plan, income statement, and financial balance sheet. The age of the farm operator (OP_AGE) has a negative and statistically siginficant influence on the financial performance, as measured by MNFI_DA, of the farm operated by YBFR. The results support the notion that farmers have fewer assets and often lower profits when they are new. Another interpretation of this finding is that older farmers have more experience and can better allocate resources where they are needed and keep them fully utilized. These results are consistent with the findings of Haden and Johnson; Mishra, El-Osta, and Johnson and Mishra, Tegegne, and Sandretto. The coefficient on ratio of farm debt to farm assets (FARM_DA) is negative and statistically significant at the 1 percent level of significance. Findings here suggest some kind of liquidity constraint and financial performance of YBFR is indirectly related to the debt-to-asset level (farming operation). On the other hand, nonfarm debt-to-asset level (OFARM_DA) has no impact on the financial performance. Although, many YBFR have a significant amount of nonfarm wealth, they do not use that wealth for borrowing money for the farming operation. Further, farm assets are mainly used to acquire additional debt (short or long term debt) for farming. A possible interpretation of this finding is that if the debts are high greater amount of the income will be used to service the debt and hence lower financial performance of the farm. Controlling variable costs of production is another important variable that contributes to the success of farm firms. Our results indicate that the ratio of cash operating expense to value of production (C_COPEVP) is negatively correlated with the financial performance of farm firm, Government farm programs are intended to decrease agricultural producers' risks (Goodwin and Schroeder), i.e., price support programs help reduce producers' price risk by assuring a guaranteed return. In this study, we include three variables that represent three different types of government program payments. The first is direct payments (GP_DIRECT), which are also called \"decoupled payments\". The second is conservation reserve program payments (GP_CRP), and finally payments are tied to production, also known as \"coupled payments\" (GP_PAYMENT). The coefficient on GP_PAYMENT is positive and statistically significant. Results suggest that YBFR participation in coupled payments increases net farm income and MNFI per dollar of assets (MNFI_DA). As reported in the literature, government commodity programs have often been identified as the primary risk-reducing mechanism for many farmers, especially those producing cash grains (Calvin; Kramer and Pope; Musser and Stamoulis). Another way to reduce risk in agriculture is through use of market oriented tools such as futures, options, marketing and production contract. In recent years, especially after the 1996 Farm Bill, farmers have increased the use of such tool (Barry). The coefficient on participation in marketing contracts is positive and significant at the 5 percent level of significance. Results indicate that YBFR who participate in marketing contracts are likely to have higher returns to farming."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The purpose of this study was to identify factors that contribute to the financial performance of   "}]
