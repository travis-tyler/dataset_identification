Its physiological role and mechanism of action are, as yet, unclear, but it may serve as a precursor of both androgenic and estrogenic steroid hormones. In the circulation, DHEA exists both free and bound to sulfate (DHEA-S). Thus, DHEA-S serves as the principal storage form of DHEA. The observation that DHEA and DHEA-S concentrations decrease markedly with age has led to the hypothesis that declining concentrations may affect both physical and cognitive aging. In particular, it has been suggested that maintaining high concentrations of DHEA and DHEA-S may prevent or reverse normal age-related declines in memory and cognitive function and may retard the development or progression of Alzheimer disease (AD). 1 In the United States, DHEA is widely available as an over-the-counter supplement, and many elderly individuals use this steroid to retard age-related cognitive as well as physical changes. Investigations of the effects of endogenous DHEA and DHEA-S on age-related cognitive changes, as well as the efficacy of DHEA supplementation in slowing cognitive decline, address an important public health concern and are subjects of considerable scientific debate. [2] [3] [4] Support for the efficacy of DHEA supplementation on the central nervous system and on cognition in particular comes primarily from rodent studies in which DHEA administration enhances longterm memory, 5 increases hippocampal longterm potentiation, 6 and reduces neuronal death in cultures of mouse embryo brain cells.\nenous DHEA-S concentrations with AD have yielded mixed results. One study 7 reported reduced circulating concentrations of DHEA-S in patients with AD, but this finding has not been replicated. [8] [9] [10] Epidemiological studies [11] [12] [13] [14] of the association between DHEA-S concentrations and cognitive status in elderly subjects without dementia have yielded largely negative results. Barrett-Connor and Edelstein 11 found that baseline DHEA-S concentrations did not predict 16-year follow-up measures of mental status, verbal or visual memory, category fluency, or visuomotor processing in men or women. In another prospective study, Yaffe et al 12 found neither differences in initial mean cognitive scores across DHEA-S quartiles nor significant correlations between baseline DHEA-S concentration and cognitive performance. In a subset of participants with follow-up cognitive testing 4 to 6 years later, the rate of cognitive change was not associated with baseline DHEA-S concentration.\nThese null findings reflect the lack of significant association between the concentration in a single, baseline DHEA-S assay and subsequent cognitive performance many years later. However, these studies do not address the hypothesized relationship between change in DHEA-S concentration and cognitive decline. Only a single study with longitudinal measures of coincident endogenous DHEA-S concentrations and cognitive outcomes can assess the association between cumulative longterm declines in DHEA-S concentration and cognitive performance.\nIn the present study, we followed up 883 men, with baseline ages from 22 to 91 years, for as long as 31 years. We obtained longitudinal cognitive measures in multiple cognitive domains and contemporaneous serum DHEA-S measures approximately every 2 years. We report the first study to our knowledge to prospectively and longitudinally assess the impact of declining DHEA-S concentrations on cognitive function in a large sample of community-dwelling men."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "STABILITY OF DHEA-S CONCENTRATION", "text": "Correlations between DHEA-S measures were examined to investigate the stability of DHEA-S concentrations within individuals over time.

Because the BLSA sample has been continuously recruited since 1958, subjects enter the BLSA in varying years and at varying ages. For the present sample, the mean age at entry was 53.2 years (range, 22-91 years), and the mean duration of follow-up was 11.55 years (range, 1-31 years). The subjects were generally well educated, with a mean \u00b1 SD education level of 16.96 \u00b1 2.73 years. Although women joined the BLSA in 1977, data for the present study were available for men only because DHEA-S assays were performed as part of a prostate disease investigation.\nThe focus of the present study was on the relationship between DHEA-S and cognition in normal aging. Therefore, subjects meeting the criteria 16 for definite (n=1), probable (n=29), or possible (n=15) AD were excluded from analyses.

First, the mean DHEA-S concentrations and cognitive test scores were computed across all assessments of each variable for every subject. The mean value was used to examine the impact of individual differences in cumulative DHEA-S exposure on cognitive status and cognitive decline. Second, the rates of change per year (within-individual slopes) were computed for DHEA-S concentration and for each of the cognitive tests for every subject with at least 3 repeated measures.\nThe association between DHEA-S concentration and cognition was examined using 3 different analytic approaches. In the first, partial correlations were computed, treating all measures as continuous variables. Mean DHEA-S concentration and DHEA-S rate of change were used to predict cognitive status (mean performance), rate of cognitive decline, and the last (most recent) cognitive score for each cognitive test, using age and years of education as covariates. Because the DHEA-S slope was negatively correlated with the initial DHEA-S value (r 578 = \u22120.53; P \u03fd .001), the initial DHEA-S concentration was used as an additional covariate in all analyses involving the DHEA-S slope.\nIn the second set of analyses, comparisons between extreme groups were performed by selecting subjects in the lowest and highest quartiles of mean DHEA-S concentration over time. Using analysis of covariance to adjust for age and years of education, we compared the cognitive status (mean cognitive score), rate of cognitive decline (slope), and the last cognitive score for each measure in the 2 groups.\nIn the third set of analyses, we tested the hypothesis that circulating DHEA-S concentration at the time of cognitive testing rather than long-term exposure or DHEA-S decline influenced cognitive status. These \"activational\" effects of DHEA-S concentration on cognition were examined for the first and the last visit at which each subject had both a DHEA-S measure and a coincident cognitive measure. Partial correlations, controlling for age and years of education, were computed to examine the relationship between circulating DHEA-S concentration and cognitive status at the time of cognitive assessment.\nTo reduce the undue influence of outliers, subjects with values greater than 3 SDs from the mean on any measure were excluded from analyses involving that variable. We did not adjust for multiple statistical comparisons, and all P values were 2-tailed (P \u03fd .05).

We used multiple statistical approaches to test whether declining DHEA-S concentrations predicted age-related changes in cognition, but no systematic relationships were apparent. Neither mean DHEA-S concentration over time nor the rate of decline within individuals predicted cognitive status or cognitive decline. Circulating concentrations of DHEA-S coincident with cognitive testing were also unrelated to cognitive performance. Moreover, despite greater than 4-fold differences among DHEA-S concentration quartiles over 12 years, the most recent cognitive score, the mean cognitive score over time, and the rate of cognitive decline did not differ as a function of DHEA-S quartile.\nAlthough the number of statistically significant correlations exceeded the number expected by chance alone (Table 2) , these correlations were small in magnitude and were, in the majority of cases, opposite to the hypothesized direction. Moreover, the fact that none of these significant findings were replicated in comparisons between extreme groups strongly suggests that these results were spurious, consequent to performing multiple statistical tests in a large sample.\nDespite finding no evidence of a beneficial effect of higher endogenous DHEA-S concentrations on cognitive status or cognitive decline, data in our sample replicated the well-described age-related decline in DHEA-S concentration and cognitive performance. [24] [25] [26] Both DHEA-S concentration and cognitive performance showed significant age-related differences in cross-sectional analyses. Moreover, our longitudinal findings confirmed that the age-related decline in DHEA-S concentration was detectable within individuals, replicating the longitudinal studies of Orentreich et al 22 and Nafziger et al. 23 Although we cannot confirm the null hypothesis, the fact that our results reproduced well-established findings on age-associated changes suggests that both the DHEA-S concentrations and cognitive measures in the present study were reliable and valid indices of physiological and neurocognitive aging. This observation, combined with our large sample size, suggests that our design was capable of detecting an association between DHEA-S concentrations and cognition if, in fact, one existed. Extant population studies [11] [12] [13] [14] investigating the relationship between endogenous DHEA-S concentrations and cognitive aging are uniform in finding no significant association between DHEA-S concentration and cognitive status in the elderly. However, these studies relied on a single measure of DHEA-S that was often not coincident with the neuropsychological evaluation. This feature precluded the examination of the effects of the rate of decline of DHEA-S concentrations on cognitive status or cognitive change. In our longitudinal study, we followed up a large sample over a long period to quantify long-term change in DHEA-S concentrations in direct temporal association with longitudinal change in a wide variety of neuropsychological outcome measures. Our failure to find a systematic longitudinal relationship between the rate of decline of DHEA-S concentration and cognitive change presents the strongest evidence to date against the hypothesis that high endogenous DHEA-S concentrations are associated with positive neuropsychological outcomes in healthy aging men.\nIt could be argued that the central nervous system, rather than DHEA-S concentrations in the blood, might affect neuropsychological performance. Circulating DHEA-S concentration does enter the central nervous system, and blood concentrations of DHEA-S are highly correlated with cerebrospinal fluid concentrations. 27 Recent work 28, 29 has also emphasized the importance of intracrine, autocrine, and paracrine formation of DHEA and other steroids in the brain and other peripheral tissues. However, neither our data nor the hypothesis that there is a relationship between circulating DHEA and DHEA-S and cognition addresses the issue of whether de novo synthesis of DHEA in neural tissue affects cognitive function.\nOne limitation of our findings is that they are based on observational data, rather than a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Recently, Wolf and colleagues 30,31 performed 2 double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled clinical trials examining the efficacy of DHEA replacement therapy on cognition. In both of these trials, DHEA supplementation of 50 mg/d for 2 weeks failed to have any cognitive-enhancing effects in either men or women. However, these clinical trials examined only a limited range of cognitive abilities in a relatively small sample of subjects over a short duration. Although current scientific evidence from epidemiological studies and clinical trials does not support the hypothesis that there is a relationship between DHEA or DHEA-S and cognition, a large placebo-controlled clinical trial is needed to conclusively evaluate the efficacy of exogenous DHEA supplementation on cognition in healthy aging individuals.\nAnother caveat of the present study is that our sample included relatively high-functioning, well-educated, community-dwelling volunteers. We cannot exclude the possibility that the decline of endogenous DHEA and DHEA-S concentrations may be an important factor in more poorly functioning individuals or in individuals with dementia. Although case-control studies [7] [8] [9] [10] comparing DHEA-S concentrations in individuals with or without dementia have yielded mixed results, the possibility that DHEA supplementation may prove beneficial in AD or other forms of dementia may merit further consideration.\nIn summary, the results of the present study provide no support for the hypothesis that high concentrations of DHEA-S are associated with higher cognitive status or reduced cognitive decline in healthy aging men.\nAlthough both DHEA-S concentrations and neuropsychological performance clearly decline with age, these phenomena appear to occur independently of one another. Because so many middle-aged and elderly individuals currently use DHEA or DHEA-S supplements to retard physical and cognitive aging, it is essential to establish which body systems are affected by a decline in endogenous DHEA and DHEA-S concentrations and whether any physiological and psychological benefits are likely to accrue from exogenous supplementation.
