[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Persistent above average precipitation and runoff and associated increased sediment transfers from cultivated ecosystems to rivers and oceans are due to changes in climate and human action. The US Upper Midwest has experienced a 37% increase in precipitation , leading to increased crop damage from excess water and off-farm loss of soil and nutrients. Farmer adaptive management responses to changing weather patterns have potential to reduce crop losses and address degrading soil and water resources. This research used farmer survey (n = 4778) and climate data to model influences of geophysical context, past weather, on-farm flood and saturated soils experiences, and risk and vulnerability perceptions on management practices. Seasonal precipitation varied across six Upper Midwest subregions and was significantly associated with variations in management. Increased warm-season precipitation (2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011) relative to the past 40 yr was positively associated with no-till, drainage, and increased planting on highly erodible land (HEL). Experience with saturated soils was significantly associated with increased use of drainage and less use of notill, cover crops, and planting on HEL. Farmers in counties with a higher percentage of soils considered marginal for row crops were more likely to use no-till, cover crops, and plant on HEL. Respondents who sell corn through multiple markets were more likely to have planted cover crops and planted on HEL in 2011.This suggests that regional climate conditions may not well represent individual farmers' actual and perceived experiences with changing climate conditions. Accurate climate information downscaled to localized conditions has potential to influence specific adaptation strategies.\nAgriculture | Climate | Natural Resources and Conservation | Rural Sociology | Water Resource Management Comments"}, {"section_title": "", "text": "I ncreased annual precipitation and heavy precipitation events are now observed and predicted to continue to characterize the US Midwest climate and have a direct influence on agriculture (Walthall et al., 2013; Hatfield et al., 2014) . Variations in the hydrologic cycle marked by increased precipitation, runoff, and sediment transfers to rivers and oceans reflect increasing degradation of soil and water resources (Rossi et al., 2009; Collins et al., 2011) . Land surface erosion from flowing water, saturated and ponded soils, and flooding have immediate and long-term implications for agricultural productive capacities and ecosystem functions associated with C cycling and water quality. The Third National Climate Assessment (NCA3) highlighted concern for \"the current loss and degradation of critical agricultural soil and water assets, \" potential losses in future crop productivity in the United States, and the need for reactive and proactive adaptation strategies in response to changes in climate (Melillo et al., 2014, p. 46) .\nCultivated ecosystems, in particular the major cereal crops corn or maize (Zea mays L.), rice (Oryza sativa L.), soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), provide 75% of the world's caloric intake, with the United States producing one-third of the world's corn (USDA, 2014) . In 2011, almost 63.9 million ha (158 million acres) of harvested grain corn and soybean generated US$101.5 billion in cash receipts for US agriculture (USDA, 2014) , with 70% of these hectares located in the Upper Midwest. The corn-soybean rotation is the dominant corn-based system in this region; however, there are other cornbased systems such as corn after corn every year (continuous corn) and extended rotations of corn, soybean, and other crops on 3-or 4-yr cycles. Farmers' adaptive management decisions to adjust to changing climate conditions will affect the productivity of these cropping systems and have short-and long-term impacts on individual farmer livelihoods, local and US economies, and ecosystem conditions . Thus, there is a need to better understand how farmer experiences and their perceptions of risk associated with the timing, intensity, and amounts of rain and snow in their locale influence management decisions (Arbuckle et al., 2015; Walthall et al., 2013) .\nIntensive cultivation and low diversity of land use coupled with a changing climate has a number of unintended consequences on soil and water resources and long-term productivity (Blesh and Drinkwater, 2013; Segura et al., 2014) . As the frequency and intensity of precipitation events continue to change (Karl et al., 2009) , impacts of climate change on the agroecosystem of the Upper Midwest are becoming more visible to farmers, agricultural businesses, natural resource agencies, and environmental organizations with regional, national, and global interests. The challenge to agriculture is to find strategies that sustain and increase productivity while protecting ecosystem integrity (Blesh and Drinkwater, 2013) .\nAlthough the most robust climate change signals are global, farmer adaptive management responses are highly localized, based on personal experiences and perceptions of risks to their land and livelihood. Thus, climate change observations and predictions at large scales-globally, nationally, and even regionally-may have limited perceived or practical value and application to farmers' management decisions as they adapt their own enterprise. Farmer adaptation to climate change is fundamentally a set of adjustments in management practices based on short-and long-term production and conservation goals and perceptions of uncertainty and risk associated with changing conditions. The installation or enhancement of drainage systems, changing tillage practices, and adding a cover crop to a corn-based rotation are several of the adaptive management strategies that can be put in place to reduce the risks associated with flooding, saturated soils, ponding, and off-farm sediment and nutrient losses due to excess water. Planting highly erodible land (HEL) to cultivated crops can also be considered an adaptive response to changing climate and variable market conditions, which, however, from a soil erosion and water quality perspective, could be labeled \"maladaptive.\"\nIn this study, we proposed that farmers' management decisions incorporate signals from local extreme events and long-term weather conditions and experiences with saturated soils, flooding, crop markets, and the biophysical aspects of their farmland. It follows that farm management adaptation probably varies across Upper Midwest watersheds in relation to differing climate and weather patterns. Farmers' management practices in 2011 were examined in light of a prior 5-yr wet period (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) ; their on-farm experiences with saturated soil, flooding, and erosion; perceptions of the risks associated with excess water concerns and corn markets; and the influence of their peers and other organizations controlling for hectares in crops, the percentage of land rented, heads of cattle and hogs, and education.\nIn this study, the overall and subregional climate patterns of the Upper Midwest of the past 5 yr were compared with the last 40 yr. Climate change implications were developed for the cornsoybean rotation and the suite of management practices available to farmers to better address the risk of excess water associated with potential crop and income losses and degradation of soil and water resources. The research design combined data from a 2012 random sample mail survey of 4778 farmers with climate and soil data. Structural equation models were then developed to test posited relationships among climate, geophysical context, on-farm experiences, perceived risk, and relationship influences associated with adaptive and maladaptive responses."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Context: Climate Patterns of the Upper Midwest", "text": "Climate is the distribution of weather with time. Many aspects of this distribution are associated with agricultural practices at local scales. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports on world climate focuses on global trends and regional patterns where signals of temperature increase are most robust. They observed (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2014, Ch. 26) that evidence of anthropogenic climatic influence on agriculture in North America is not clearly established but found that agriculture has substantial sensitivity to climate variability. Understanding of global Earth-human relationships requires attention to these large-scale trends. However, although global warming is projected to lead to increased daily-scale precipitation extremes affecting agriculture and water, it is very likely that locale-specific temperature and precipitation variations will emerge throughout North America (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2014). Further, there is evidence that individual experiences with weather and climate are very local, and many adaptive solutions are applied locally (Rejesus et al., 2013) . Thus, production planning and management decisions on individual fields and farms are most likely to be influenced by field-scale climate factors, while global-scale climate factors more likely to impact the prices farmers receive for their crops (NOAA, 2011) .\nOf interest to this study was the distribution of weather in the Upper Midwest, specifically the expected total precipitation during the growing season and the frequency of excessively wet seasons. Unusually wet seasons may impact agricultural practices differently, depending on the long-term climate and landscape. For example, relatively wet seasons in typically dry regions of the Upper Midwest may allow marginal lands to be pulled into crop production. On the other hand, relatively wet seasons in typically wet areas may be detrimental to crop production. Seasonal wetness also interacts with the frequency of heavy precipitation events, another important characteristic of the distribution of weather events. Warmer air can hold more water vapor than cooler air, and this extra moisture contributes to storm systems with heavier rainfall (Coumou and Rahmstorf, 2012; Melillo et al., 2014) . This suggests that the 37% increase in very heavy precipitation documented in this region from 1958 to 2012 is likely to have influenced farmer perceptions of risk and adaptation strategies put in place to manage excess water (Melillo et al., 2014) .\nThree characteristics-expected seasonal precipitation, excessive seasonal wetness, and frequency of heavy precipitation events-are summarized locally across the Upper Midwest in Fig.  1 to 3. Seasonal and daily extremes during the 5-yr period 2007 to 2011 were assessed in the context of a historical record covering 1971 to 2011 at 521 National Weather Service Cooperative Observer Network (NWS COOP) stations. Warm-season precipitation totals, defined as the total precipitation between 1 April and 30 September, were computed at each station. At a selected station, the seasonal total for each year in the record was ranked from 1/41 (lowest seasonal total) to 41/41 (highest seasonal total), and these rankings were converted to percentile ranks. The median warm-season precipitation is the Fig. 1 . median warm-season precipitation from the historical record at National Weather Service Cooperative Observer Program stations. Warmseason precipitation is defined as the total precipitation from 1 April to 30 September. The reported value is the median of these yearly totals from 1971 to 2011. precipitation amount corresponding to a percentile rank of 50% and quantifies the expected seasonal precipitation for a location. These median precipitation totals are displayed in Fig. 1 . The Corn Belt is situated in a northwest to southeast gradient in median seasonal precipitation, with farmers in southwestern Minnesota and eastern Nebraska expecting <500 mm during the warm season while southern Indiana receives >700 mm during half of all growing seasons.\nThe percentile rank of warm-season precipitation can also quantify the extent of relatively wet or dry conditions during recent growing seasons. Figure 2 presents the excessive seasonal wetness patterns across the region using the average of the percentile ranks during the 5-yr period of 2007 to 2011. This map highlights local areas that have experienced relatively wet or dry conditions during the 5-yr period. The prevalence of values >50% reflects the widespread pattern of unusually wet conditions leading up to 2011.\nDaily precipitation extremes were also assessed using the NWS COOP archive. The 99th percentile of daily precipitation totals was computed for each month from April to September at each location. The extreme heavy daily precipitation patterns are as important to agricultural management practices as the changes in average precipitation. It is these \"gully washers\" that have significant consequences for soil erosion and crop losses. Our third weather and climate map is the percentage of days from 2007 to 2011 for which precipitation exceeded the 99th percentile ( Fig. 3) . Many locations experienced extremes on at least 1% of days, which is the expectation. Several watersheds in Iowa experienced more than twice as many heavy rainfall events as expected. These events are locally remembered as the floods of 2008, 2009, and 2010, which caused considerable damage to urban and rural places (Olson, 2009; Olson et al., 2011) ."}, {"section_title": "Excess Water Impacts on Corn-Based Cropping Systems", "text": "Changes in the seasonal distribution of precipitation, along with precipitation increases and more extreme rainfall events, have a number of implications for corn-based cropping systems of the Upper Midwest. Plant vegetative and reproductive development is sensitive to the timing and availability of water. Excessive rain during the spring planting season can delay planting, causing risks to productivity and profitability for the corn crop (Hatfield et al., 2011) . Seed germination is influenced by moisture, temperature, and seed-soil contact. The corn seed will absorb water until it has 30 to 35% moisture at germination when it begins its growth; however, seeds exposed to prolonged cool, wet conditions germinate and develop slowly and are likely to result in an injured plant or die (Abendroth et al., 2011) . Flooding in the early growing season is associated with anoxia, increases to susceptibility to root disease, increases in soil compaction due to the use of heavy farm equipment on wet soils, soil erosion and runoff, and off-field and -farm leaching of N, P, and other nutrients into ground and surface waters (Hatfield et al., 2011) .\nProlonged flooding (24-48 h) or intense rain during early vegetative stages can lead to distortion and stunting with excessive tillering or complete lack of ear and tassel formation (Mueller and Sisson, 2013) . Changes in moisture and timing of precipitation have been found to be associated with overwintering and increased seed production of weeds, altering the competition between invasive weeds and corn-based cropping systems and subsequently affecting productivity (Patterson, 1995; Bradley and Mustard, 2005; Hatfield et al., 2011) . Further, as the soil becomes saturated, it is less able to maintain infiltration rates high enough to absorb high-intensity rainfall events, leading to runoff, soil erosion, and loss of N, P, and other production inputs. The corn-soybean rotation is known to be a leaky system, with N leaching into surface waters. Mississippi River Basin grain farming has been identified as a primary cause of hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico as a result of off-farm nutrient losses (Qi et al., 2011; Blesh and Drinkwater, 2013) .\nThere are a number of adaptive (and maladaptive) management strategies that farmers of corn-based systems have put in place to assure high yields and profitability under excess water conditions while responding to soil erosion and water quality concerns. These include (i) the addition and enhancement of farm drainage systems, (ii) conversion to no-till, and (iii) the use of cover crops. A fourth strategy has been to expand planting into HEL. Key drivers of this strategy have been the expiration of 10-to 15-yr contracts for hectarage enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program, low corn carryover stocks in the United States, and grain price volatility associated with increased weather variability (NOAA, 2011; Stabbe, 2013) ."}, {"section_title": "Farmer Adaptation Strategies", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Farm Drainage", "text": "Subsurface tile drainage is used to transform poorly drained soils into productive cropland and provides economic benefits through removal of excess water from the soil column; this results in decreased surface water runoff and reduced soil erosion and loss of P attached to eroding soils (Sugg, 2007) . Farm drainage is a routine practice, with more than a third of cultivated areas in the Midwest and more than three-quarters of Illinois and Iowa cropland tile drained (Power et al., 2000; Nangia et al., 2010) . Much of the drainage in the Upper Midwest occurs in the spring and early summer. Although drainage can reduce soil erosion and protect soil structure by reducing compaction from equipment traffic, there is increasing evidence that subsurface drainage can accelerate the transfer of NO 3 -N from fields to streams and rivers in the Mississippi River Basin and ultimately the Gulf of Mexico (Qi et al., 2011; Kaspar et al., 2012) ."}, {"section_title": "No-Till", "text": "No-till is a practice that provides substantial protection from the erosive effects of rainfall and the movement of water across farm fields. No-till is a form of reduced tillage where the soil is left undisturbed from harvest to planting except for strips up to 1/3 of the row width for planting the seed, with weed control accomplished with herbicides and methods other than tillage (Coughenour, 2003) . Any tillage practice compared with sod, pasture, and grasslands leads to changes in soil characteristics and the loss of soil organic C (SOC) storage and retention (Olson, 2010) . However, a reduction in tillage in cultivated systems reduces soil erosion and nutrient and sediment losses to proximate waterways and retains more organic matter and SOC (Horowitz et al., 2010) . Poor soil structure and erosion are major causes of soil degradation, weak plant growth, and loss of crop productivity (Wang et al., 1985; Lal et al., 2004) .\nVariations in soil organic matter are directly associated with differences in the soil's capacity to store water (Hudson, 1994; Jiang et al., 2008) . One measure of soil degradation is a decrease in the soil water holding capacity as a result of reduced SOC (Hatfield and Morton, 2013) . Changes in soil properties can increase or reduce the impact of intense rainfall events on the soil surface and affect the amount of water absorbed and stored and soil erosion that occurs (Hatfield and Morton, 2013) . Soil aggregates under no-till management are more stable when exposed to rainfall because increased soil organic matter reduces breakdown of the soil structure, thus increasing resistance to erosion when exposed to raindrops during rainfall events (Hatfield and Morton, 2013) ."}, {"section_title": "Cover Crops", "text": "Cover crops are plants grown to cover the soil between harvest and before the establishment of crops such as corn and soybean the following growing season (Arbuckle and Ferrell, 2012) . Cover crops have the potential to mitigate the effects of excess precipitation by (i) preventing erosion, (ii) retaining C and improving soil structure, (iii) scavenging N, thereby reducing NO 3 leaching into drainage ditches and waterways, (iv) improving soil permeability and increasing water infiltration and aeration, (v) suppressing weeds and thereby maintaining or boosting crop yields, and (vi) reducing greenhouse gas emissions (Kladivko et al., 2004; Strock et al., 2004; Hillel and Rosenzweig, 2011; Kaspar et al., 2012; Midwest Cover Crops Council, 2012) . Soils without vegetation or crop residue are exposed to surface sealing and soil crusting from raindrops, which consolidate the surface layers and change the soil properties (Hatfield and Morton, 2013) . After the soil surface seals, erosive forces increase sheet and rill erosion and off-field N loss under heavy rainfall (Hatfield and Morton, 2013) . The biomass of a cover crop acts as a barrier between the soil surface and the flow of water, allowing infiltration into the soil profile rather than runoff. Cover crops used in conjunction with tile drainage have been found to reduce the average annual flow of NO 3 concentration (Strock et al., 2004; Qi and Helmers, 2010) ."}, {"section_title": "Planting on Highly Erodible Lands", "text": "Both grassland and cropland used for agricultural purposes offer direct economic returns to the land owner. Topography, soil characteristics, climate patterns (changes in wetness or droughtiness), and local and global markets influence land use functions and values (Hatfield and Morton, 2013) . In recent years, volatile weather events and increased demand for biofuel feedstocks has removed the buffer of excess grain production capacity, lowered carryover of grain stocks, and led to a doubling of corn and soybean prices (NOAA, 2011; Wright and Wimberly, 2013) . As a result, cropland has provided a higher direct economic value to landowners and accelerated conversion of grassland to cropland in the US Corn Belt (Claassen et al., 2011; Wright and Wimberly, 2013) . While grasslands have lower direct cash value, they are less susceptible to soil erosion and sediment runoff and receive lower levels of fertilizer applications, which can translate into less nutrient runoff to water, thereby providing a higher level of offsite and indirect benefits downstream (Claassen et al., 2011) .\nThe term highly erodible land, a legal designation determined by the NRCS, refers to land with soils highly susceptible to erosion by wind or water, the two primary causes of land degradation (Farm Service Agency, 2007; Blanco-Canqui and Lal, 2010, p. 2) . Much HEL has long and steep slopes, with soils susceptible to erosion and increased vulnerability to high rates of runoff during heavy rains. High grain prices provide a strong market signal and in the western Corn Belt have accelerated the rate of conversion of highly erodible grassland into row crop production at a rate of 1.0 to 5.4% annually (Wright and Wimberly, 2013) . The 2012 Census of Agriculture estimated that farmland in the Conservation Reserve Program and the Wetlands Reserve Program declined from 15.6 million to 11.1 million ha between 2007 and 2012 (National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2014). The Environmental Working Group estimates that a total of 2.1 million ha of previously uncultivated HEL was planted with row crops, primarily wheat and corn, between 2009 and 2012 (Cox and Rundquist, 2013) .\nThis trend suggests that expanding row crop production into HEL is a maladaptive response to plentiful rain, with possible short-term economic benefits but long-term negative water and soil consequences. Combined, the increased frequency of extreme precipitation and land use change have made Midwest farmlands and specific watersheds more vulnerable to soil erosion, sediment-laden runoff containing excess N and P, and increased crop damage from excessive water."}, {"section_title": "Study Design", "text": "This study explored the relationships of actual local soil and climate conditions, farmer perceptions and experiences with excess water, and adaptive responses to better understand how farmers are responding to these events and how the variations across Upper Midwest watersheds relate to adaptation practices on the landscape. Specifically, we examined the adaptive and maladaptive management responses associated with (i) geophysical contexts, (ii) past weather patterns, (iii) on-farm experiences with flooding, saturated soils and water ponding, increased loss of nutrients, more variable weather, and increased erosion, (iv) relationship influences of public and private farm groups and individuals, and (v) perceptions of risk and vulnerability associated with concerns about too much water and diversity of grain markets. Structural equation models were developed to understand these relationships using a suite of management practices: drainage, no-till, cover crops, and increased planting on HEL.\nOur analysis focused on a suite of four adaptive practices as dependent variables. A 2012 USDA CSCAP-U2U jointly administered stratified random sample mail survey was completed by 4778 farmers with at least US$100,000 in gross sales and a minimum of 32 ha of corn production in 22 Hydrologic Unit Code 6 Upper Midwest watersheds (for survey details, see Supplemental Materials). The survey included a question set that asked farmers to estimate what percentage of the land that they farmed in 2011 (owned and/or rented) was (i) artificially drained through tile or other methods, (ii) managed by no-till, (iii) planted to cover crops, and (iv) highly erodible land that was planted to crops. We combined values from owned and rented land by computing the maximum of the two percentages reported for owned and rented land for each of the four practices."}, {"section_title": "Explanatory Variables", "text": "Our modeling objective was to characterize the relationships among these adaptive practices and between them and several explanatory variables. We grouped our explanatory variables into six conceptual categories. Two predictors characterized the geophysical context: proximity to a creek, stream, or river and soil capability classification. Proximity to a creek, stream, or river was self-reported on the survey, and the soil capability variable was constructed as the proportion of unirrigated land classified in Soil Capability Classes 4 to 8 according to the NRCS classification system, as mapped in each respondent's county. The NRCS soil capability classification system (Classes 1-8) uses the land's ability to grow crops as a metric to evaluate soil suitability for specific uses (Hatfield and Morton, 2013) . Class 1 is best suited for growing a wide range of crops and Class 8 is considered unsuitable for growing crops. Classes 2 and 3 have moderate to severe limitations that reduce the choice of plants that can be grown and require special conservation practices to assure crop productivity. Soils classified in Classes 4 to 8 are considered marginal, with substantive limitations on their productive capacities for row crops, and require careful management. Both variables characterize the landscape and may be related to the adoption of our practices of interest.\nClimate and weather, especially precipitation, may also relate to adaptive management practices. Long-term average precipitation can influence the need for drainage, and unusual weather events at a variety of time scales, from daily to seasonal, may relate to the timing of planting and harvest as well as root establishment and plant growth and development. We utilized the three weather and climate variables defined above ( Fig.  1-3 ) constructed from daily precipitation records from the NWS COOP network. Each survey respondent was matched to the closest NWS COOP station to provide individual-level weather and climate data on median warm-season precipitation, warm-season precipitation anomaly (percentile rank), and daily extreme precipitation frequency. The average distance from the closest NWS COOP station to a respondent's zip code was 14.3 km.\nWe are particularly interested in the interaction between weather and climate, given the unusually wet seasons of 2007 to 2011 leading up to the CSCAP-U2U survey. Excessive rainfall over areas that have relatively wet climates (e.g., Illinois and Indiana) may influence management practices differently than unusually wet conditions over areas that have relatively dry climates (e.g., Nebraska). To investigate this further, we grouped the surveyed watersheds into six subregions. Watersheds were grouped according to water resource regions (Hydrologic Unit Code 2), with two watersheds in the Great Lakes region, two watersheds in the Ohio region, 10 watersheds in the Upper Mississippi region, and eight watersheds in the Missouri region. The watersheds in the Upper Mississippi region were further divided into three subregions, with watersheds primarily in Iowa making up one subregion, those in Illinois making up another subregion, and the two remaining watersheds in Minnesota and Wisconsin making up a third subregion. The subregions are depicted in Fig. 1 to 3 .\nThe next set of variables measured farmers' self-reported \"on-farm\" experience with weather extremes. Two dichotomous variables (0 = no, 1 = yes) measured whether within the previous 5 yr farmers had experienced four phenomena on the land they farm. These were: \"problems with saturated soils or ponding\" or \"significant flooding (stream/river).\" Two other variables were reported on a five-point scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5). Respondents reported their level of agreement that during the past 5 yr at least some of their land had experienced significant soil erosion or they had noticed more variable or unusual weather on their farm.\nTwo predictor variables represented aspects of perceived risk and may be related to implementation of adaptive practices. One perceived risk variable measured the diversity of farmers' corn markets as a simple count of the number of options respondents chose when asked for which markets they produce corn.\nRespondents were asked to select all that applied from a list of six options: (i) commodity (sweetener, export, feed), (ii) ethanol, (iii) livestock (silage), (iv) specialty or value-added including organic, (v), seed, and (vi) other. The other perceived risk variable was a factor score from a factor analysis of five items related to concerns about excess water (see Supplemental Materials). The five items measured concerns about increased flooding, more frequent extreme rains, saturated soils and ponded water, loss of nutrients into waterways, and soil erosion on a four-point scale (not concerned, slightly concerned, concerned, very concerned).\nFarmers' implementation of adaptive management practices may be influenced by input from other people and organizations, so we incorporated five predictors that measured relationship influence. These measures were factor scores from a factor analysis on eight survey items (see Supplemental Materials). One factor measured the overall influence of all actors, and the remaining factors measured the influence of specific types of actors. These are public agriculture (NRCS, soil and water conservation office, state climatologist, university extension, and state department of agriculture), farm organizations, agriculture peers (other farmers), and private agriculture (seed dealers and farm chemical dealers).\nWe also incorporated several control variables, including the level of education, total cropland, proportion of land rented, total cattle, and total hogs.

In addition, a multivariate normal population model was developed for the collection of predictors because some control and on-farm experience variables were missing as well.\nA Bayesian analysis was implemented for the missing data model, and any missing values were sampled from their posterior predictive distribution (see Supplemental Materials). These sampled values were imputed for use in the Bayesian analysis of the multivariate tobit model. The relationship influence factors, perceived risk, and climate and weather variables were completely observed. Results Table 1 summarizes the reported percentages and means for the response variables. Almost 75% of respondents reported that at least some cropland they farmed was artificially drained, and 23% reported that 100% of their land was drained. Artificial drainage is the most commonly used of the four adaptive practices. Just over 60% of respondents reported using no-till on at least some of their land, with 18% reporting use on 100% of their land. More than one-fourth of the sample reported using cover crops, with most of those planting cover crops on 40% or less of their land. Nearly 60% of farmers surveyed reported planting at least some HEL to crops.\nTables 2 and 3 summarize the covariates used in the multivariate regression models. Nearly three-fourths of respondents reported experience with saturated soils, and a majority agreed or strongly agreed that they had noticed more variable or unusual weather on their farms. About one-fourth of the sample agreed or strongly agreed that they had experienced significant soil erosion. As noted previously (Fig. 2) , most locations saw five particularly wet years from 2007 to 2011, with the average warm-season anomaly precipitation percentile rank being 0.64. An average of 1.3% of days saw precipitation exceeding the 99th percentile (extreme precipitation frequency 2007-2011). The distribution for the diverse corn market variable indicates that more than half of the respondents produced corn for at least two different markets. Table 4 presents the posterior means for the standardized multivariate tobit model coefficients along with the Gelman and Pardoe (2006) measures of explained variability. Overall, climate and weather, geophysical context, and on-farm experience tended to be significant predictors of the adaptive practices. In addition, the adaptive practices were significantly associated with each other. Relationship influence factors were generally not significant predictors, and perceived risk had different relationships for different practices. Median warm-season precipitation was positively associated with the percentage of land that is artificially drained; climatologically, wetter areas are more extensively drained. Drainage is less prevalent in areas with a larger proportion of marginal soils. Drainage was also significantly related to the on-farm experience predictors, having positive relationships with proximity to a river or stream and experience with saturated soils, while having negative relationships with experience with river flooding and erosion. There were regional differences in the relationships between drainage and the frequency of daily extreme precipitation. No relationship was evident in Illinois, Iowa, and southern Indiana (Ohio basin), while a positive association was found in the northern (Great Lakes and Upper Mississippi basins) and western (Missouri basin) parts of the Corn Belt."}, {"section_title": "Model Findings", "text": "The predicted percentage of land in no-till increased with increasing median warm-season precipitation and proportion of marginal soils.

Once again, relatively wet conditions in the western Corn Belt watersheds in the Missouri and Upper Mississippi basins predicted greater use of no-till, but the opposite relationship was found in the Great Lakes region. Two relationship influence factors, the overall influence and public agriculture, showed modest positive association with the percentage of land in no-till.\nThe model for cover crops accounted for the least explained variability among the four practices, but several predictors were significant. Climate had minimal association with cover crop use, with the exception of a negative relationship in the Ohio basin for warm-season precipitation anomaly. Experience with flooding predicted additional use of cover crops, while experience with saturated soils predicted reduced use of cover crops. The number of corn market outlets used was positively associated with land in cover crops. Farmers who reported a stronger decision-making influence from private agriculture entities (seed and chemical dealers) had lower expected cover crop use.\nThe percentage of HEL planted to crops was positively associated with the proportion of marginal soils and median warm-season precipitation. Positive relationships also existed with proximity to a river or stream and experience with significant soil erosion. As the number of total markets for corn increased, the expected percentage of HEL planted increased. Regional differences were present in the relationship between HEL and warm-season precipitation anomalies for the previous 5 yr. Parts of the western Corn Belt that were relatively wetter coincide with additional HEL planted to crops, and locations in the Ohio River basin that were relatively wetter had less predicted HEL planted to crops. Cropping of HEL was also strongly related to the other adaptive practices: drainage (negative), no-till (positive), and cover crops (positive)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The timing, amount, and intensity of precipitation during the growing season can have large effects on the capacity of a crop to establish, grow and develop, and reach its full grain yield potential. Excess water on the landscape not only can compromise crop productivity but also influences soil erosion, off-field and off-farm nutrient losses, and degraded conditions across the landscape (Segura et al., 2014) . Although our models are complex, with a variety of nuances that will need continued exploration, there are three key findings that inform our understanding of factors that influence Midwestern farmers' adaptation to changing conditions. First, warm-season precipitation varies across the six subregions of the Upper Midwest (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) and is significantly associated with variations in agricultural management practices. Second, increased wetness in the last 5 yr relative to the past 40 yr (warm-season precipitation anomaly) and median warm-season precipitation when linked to farmer practices (drainage, no-till, cover crops, and planting crops on HEL) reveal differential responses associated with geographic location (subregion), personal experiences with saturated soils and flooding, marginality of soils, and diversification of corn markets. Excessive precipitation can be problematic for traditionally wet parts of the eastern Corn Belt, but wetter conditions make the traditionally drier west more suitable for production.\nThird, practices are significantly related to each other. Increased planting on HEL is associated with increased use of no-till and cover crops. This may partially be explained by NRCS requirements that when 50 acres (20 ha) or one third or more of the total field acreage are identified as highly erodible, a conservation plan must be in place to substantially reduce soil erosion projected to occur from the cropping use to retain eligibility for government benefit programs (such as USDA programs for crop insurance, marketing loans, and disaster assistance [Farm Service Agency, 2007] ). No-till and cover crops are two conservation practices that have some capacity to mitigate runoff and soil loss on steep slopes. Part of the complementariness of these practices may be the different time scales associated with the capacity to manage excess water (e.g., drainage, long; cover crops and HEL, short).\nOur results show that many Upper Midwest corn farmers use a suite of practices to help them better address management issues associated with too much water on the landscape. Farmers consider risks and uncertainties associated with future weather conditions on a daily basis. \"As such, farmers have experience in dealing with climate variability and uncertainty, but increases in ranges of variability have the potential to put farms' adaptive capacities to the test, creating substantial challenges\" (Crane et al., 2011, p. 180 ). This suggests that as increased climate variability becomes more visible, farmers will continue to explore how to develop resilient management systems that have the flexibility to serve multifunctional goals of crop productivity while addressing soil and water resource integrity. Although widespread awareness and discussions about climate change as a root cause have been limited in the farm community, adaptation to protect farm investments is occurring (NOAA, 2011; Rejesus et al., 2013) . The NCA3 confirms our findings that agriculture has been adapting to recent climate changes . Analysis of climate change in the first half of the 21st century suggests that adaptation strategies may be effective in the near term to reduce threats to food security (Takle et al., 2013) . However, the NCA3 urges accelerated innovation and adaptation to offset future increasing variability and uncertainty in climate conditions. Our findings suggest that generalized regional climate conditions may not well represent individual localized farmers' actual and perceived experiences with excess precipitation. Farmer responses to local climate signals of increasing seasonal precipitation with time vary considerably by geography and the specific practice. There is a need for increased localized understanding of climate patterns and how farmers incorporate actual climate conditions and perceived experiences about excess precipitation into management decisions. The four adaptive strategies presented here are only some of the combinations of practices and innovations available to farmers. More accurate downscaled climate information and detailed local forecasts beyond 3-to 5-d projections could help farmers better develop an expanded suite of short-and long-term adaptive management strategies in response to changing precipitation patterns.\nResearchers need to take seriously farmers' skills and capacity to adapt to erratic and variable circumstances in the short and long term (Crane et al., 2011) . Timescales of adoption vary among practices, and there are important relationships among practices that need to be better understood if farmers are to successfully adapt their agroecosystems."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "While global to continental climate projections offer a rule of thumb that wet areas will get wetter and dry areas drier, the Upper Midwest has a climatological gradient between wet and dry areas with substantial uncertainty as to which local areas will experience wetness and drought seasonally and across years. Localized growing season precipitation patterns are critical to seedling growth, rooting depth, and pollination and seem to be an important factor in how farmers perceive risk and prepare for extreme wet conditions. An unanswered question is, can farmers learn, experiment, and adapt quickly enough to effectively maintain their livelihoods as climate circumstances increasingly change? The NCA3 refers to adaptation as \"actions to prepare for and adjust to new conditions, thereby reducing harm or taking advantage of new opportunities\" (Melillo et al., 2014, p. 10) . The strategies farmers put in place to manage future excess water on their fields and farms will affect the short-and long-term capacity of agriculture to be productive and assure the integrity of essential soil and water resources.\n1"}, {"section_title": "Supplemental Material", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Upper Midwest Climate Variations: Farmer Responses to Excess Water Risks", "text": "Pages -11\nTables -2"}, {"section_title": "CSCAP-U2U Survey", "text": "The survey data used in this study come from a February 2012 survey of farmers stratified across 22 HUC6 watersheds in the Corn Belt (Arbuckle et al., 2013b) .
