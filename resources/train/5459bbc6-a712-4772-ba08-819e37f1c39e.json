Objective: To investigate whether amyloid load and distribution, assessed by florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET), differs between patients with probable CAA-related intracerebral hemorrhage (CAA-ICH) and mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (MCI-AD). Methods: We assessed [ 18 F]florbetapir uptake in 15 patients with probable CAA-ICH and 20 patients with MCI-AD patients. Global and regional florbetapir retention were assessed using standard uptake values ratio (SUVr) in region-based and voxelwise approaches. Visual reading of florbetapir scans was performed for all participants. Group comparisons were performed using univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: Global florbetapir retention was lower in patients with CAA-ICH than MCI-AD (median SUVr, 1.33 [1.21-1.41] versus 1.44 [1.35-1.66]; p = 0.032). In the region-based analysis, regional florbetapir distribution was similar between the two groups. There was a trend for an increased occipital/global ratio in CAA-ICH patients compared to MCI-AD (p = 0.060). In the voxel-wise approach, two clusters, one in parietal regions and the other in temporal regions, had higher uptake in MCI-AD relative to CAA patients. Conclusions: Patients with CAA-ICH had a lower global florbetapir PET burden than patients with MCI-AD. Relative florbetapir retention in the posterior regions tended to be higher in CAA patients in region-based analysis but was not statistically different between groups.

Positron-emission tomography (PET) amyloid radiotracers binds to parenchymal A\u2424 deposits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) but also to vascular A\u2424 in CAA patients [2] [3] [4] . Global amyloid tracer uptake is increased in CAA patients with or without intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) relative to healthy controls and to patients with hypertension relative ICH (HT-ICH) [4, 5] . However, this global uptake was reported as lower in CAA than in AD patients [3, 5] in two studies that compared these populations using [ 11 C]Pittsburgh compound B (PiB). Moreover, it has been suggested that the regional distribution of PiB retention may differ between patients with CAA and AD, with a greater proportion of PiB retention in the occipital lobe among patients with CAA [3, 5] . Difference in amyloid PET burden and distribution between patients with CAA and AD remain widely unknown. Identifying a specific pattern of amyloid PET distribution associated with CAA and AD respectively, may have important clinical implications since both diseases have increased amyloid burden.\nIn the present study, we pooled individual data from two independent cohorts [4, 6] to compare the in vivo uptake of the PET amyloid tracer [ 18 F]florbetapir in patients with CAA-related ICH (CAA-ICH) and mild cognitive impairment due to AD (MCI-AD). Standard uptake values ratio (SUVr) were obtained and regional as well as voxel-wise approaches for florbetapir quantification were performed. We aimed to compare the global and regional florbetapir burden between CAA-ICH and MCI-AD. Consistent with PiB studies, we hypothesized a higher relative uptake in the posterior parts of the brain in CAA patients than in MCI-AD patients."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Participants were recruited as part of two clinical research projects on ICH and AD. The recruitment procedure has been previously described [4, 6] . Briefly, we included two groups of participants in this study: CAA-ICH and MCI-AD. In order for both groups to be age-matched on mean age, two MCI-AD patients (the two oldest) were removed from analyses. CAA patients enrolled in this study presented with a symptomatic acute ICH, fulfilled the modified Boston criteria for probable CAA [7] , and had no pre-ICH dementia (IQCODE < 3.4 [8] ). Patients with MCI-AD were diagnosed with typical AD [9] at a predementia stage (Clinical Dementia Rating = 0.5). All MCI-AD patients had a memory complaint lasting more than 6 months corroborated by neuropsychological assessment (sum of the three free recalls \u2264 17/48 and/or sum of the three free and cued recalls \u2264 40/48 in the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test [10] ) and a cerebrospinal fluid analysis exhibiting amyloid pathology (level of phospho-tau \u2265 60 pg/ml and Innotest Amyloid Tau Index \u2264 0.8). In the case of ambiguous profile (i.e., phospho-tau<60 pg/ml or Innotest Amyloid Tau Index > 0.8), the A\u2424 42 /A\u2424 40 levels ratio was calculated and a ratio < 0.045 was considered compatible with AD diagnosis [11] .\nThis study was approved by the local ethics committee and the French Agency for the Safety of Health Products (A90605-58 & B111269-20).

MRI images were acquired on the same Philips 3-T Imager (Intera Achieva, Philips, Best, The Netherlands) and included a 3D T1-weighted sequence. A 3D FLAIR and a T2* GRE sequences was also performed for ICH patients to help diagnosis. A T2 sequence was performed for the MCI-AD group. MRI markers of small vessel disease in CAA patients were reported according to the Standards for Reporting Vascular Changes on Neuroimaging (STRIVE) [12] , as previously described [4] ."}, {"section_title": "Florbetapir PET acquisitions and analysis", "text": "A florbetapir PET scan was performed for each patient on the same Biograph\u2122 6 TruePoint\u2122 (Siemens Medical Solutions, Munich, Germany) high-resolution hybrid PET/CT scanner (3D detection mode, producing images with 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1.5 mm voxels and a spatial resolution of 5 mm full width at half maximum at the field of view center). Cerebral emission scans started 50 min after intravenous injection of 3.7 MBq/kg of [ 18 F]florbetapir. Frames from the 50-60-min time interval after injection were summed, and corrected for partial volume effects using the point spread function model implemented by Siemens (HD-PET\u00a9).\nFlorbetapir PET scans were first registered onto their corresponding MRI T1 scan, and then normalized in the MNI space using the transformation matrix resulting from T1 registration using FSL software (http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl). A grey matter mask (corresponding to all cortical regions from the Neuromorphometrics atlas available in SPM12) was applied to the normalized PET scans, and cortical standardized uptake values ratio (SUVr) images were obtained using the grey matter of the cerebellum as a reference region.\nBecause the presence of ICH is likely to bias the signal detection of the PET tracer, the lesioned hemisphere was masked out. Therefore, SUVr quantification was only performed in the controlesional hemisphere for the CAA group. In the MCI-AD patient group, because no significant difference in SUVr measurements was found between hemispheres (data not shown), one hemisphere was also masked out for each patient, so that SUVr from one hemisphere only was considered in that group too. The same proportion of left/right hemispheres considered in CAA patients was randomly chosen in the MCI-AD group (it is to note that similar findings were obtained when considering the other hemisphere; data not shown). In order to have all images comparable for further group analyses, all left hemispheres were flipped along the x-axis (see Supplementary  Figure 1 for details).\nFlorbetapir uptake was first quantified as follows: mean SUVr uptake was obtained in the five cortical regions (temporal, parietal, occipital, frontal, and insular) using composite ROIs extracted from the Automated Atlas Labelling (AAL [13] ) anatomical atlas. Global cortical SUVr was calculated as the mean of the SUVr in these 5 ROIs, weighed by the size of each ROI (frontal = 457436 voxels; insula = 29152 voxels; temporal = 286844 voxels; parietal = 281028 voxels; occipital = 190783 voxels). Finally, regional SUVr values were expressed proportionally to the global (weighed) SUVr measure. Ratios for SUVr values for the 5 ROIs were then computed by calculating the relative regional uptake in the five ROIs as proportionally scaled to the uptake in the global cortex. We specifically focused on the occipital/global and frontal/global ratios, as suggested by previous studies [3, 5] .\nWe then opted for a voxel-wise approach as a second step. Each voxel of the SUVr images was proportionally scaled to the mean SUVr in the global cortex, in order to obtain relative SUVr images (or adjusted to global SUVr). The hemi-cortical florbetapir uptake was compared voxel-wise from smoothed images (8 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 8) between the two groups in SPM12. The MNI coordinates of the local maxima in each significant cluster were then transferred onto the AAL atlas for regional labelling.\nIn addition, Florbetapir PET images were visually assessed for both groups by two independent nuclear medicine physicists, blind to all clinical and diagnostic information in a randomized order. Florbetapir PET scans were classified as either amyloid-positive or negative. PET scans were considered as positive when a positive response was done for at least one rater."}, {"section_title": "Analysis", "text": "Comparisons of demographic and clinical data between the groups were performed using the Mann Whitney or the t-tests, when applicable.

Investigation of differences in distribution profile of amyloid deposits between the two groups have required a fine-grained voxel-wise analysis. The distribution of florbetapir assessed by ROI analysis was not statistically different between the two groups, even if the relative occipital florbetapir retention (expressed as the occipital-to-global-ratio) tended to be higher in the CAA group than in the MCI-AD group. In the voxel-wise quantitative analysis, patients with MCI-AD had higher florbetapir retention in the temporal and parietal regions compared to patients with CAA-ICH. No region showed significantly higher uptake in CAA-ICH versus MCI-AD patients.\nBased on pathological studies demonstrating that the occipital lobe is the most severely affected by CAA [14, 15] , it had been hypothesized that amyloid tracer retention would predominantly be increased in the occipital region. Only two amyloid PET studies, using PiB, have explored the burden and distribution of amyloid in CAA patients compared to patients with probable AD. In line with our florbetapir study, global PiB uptake was shown to be higher in patients with AD than in CAA. These two PiB PET studies also reported a higher occipital-to-global ratio in CAA patients than in AD patients. However, in a larger study of Gurol et al., comparing relative occipital-to-global PiB uptake in CAA versus MCI/AD patients, the authors found no difference between groups [16] . Our present results seem to converge with those of Ly et al. [3] and Johnson et al. [5] . In our amyloid PET studies, using [ 18 F]florbetapir, although absolute occipital amyloid retention values (both in ROI-based and voxel-based analyses) were not increased in patients with CAA-ICH compared to MCI-AD, the relative occipital amyloid retention tented to be higher in CAA-ICH patients than in MCI-AD. Our results did not reach significance, possibly due to a limited statistical power. As pointed out by Charidimou et al. in their meta-analysis, there is an issue of high statistical heterogeneity in all previous published studies on amyloid PET, working on small sample populations [17] . Indeed, other research groups reported no significant difference in occipitalto-global ratio uptake between patients with CAA and healthy controls or patients with HT-ICH [4, 16, 18] . Taken together, these findings call for replication studies.\nCompared to patients with MCI-AD, our CAA patients did not demonstrate significantly increased relative florbetapir retention in any region. Conversely, two clusters in the temporal and parietal regions had increased relative florbetapir retention in patients with MCI-AD compared to patients with CAA. Recently, Grothe et al. analyzed florbetapir PET scans of 667 patients from the ADNI cohort (from healthy controls to demented AD patients) [19] . They found a consistent regional hierarchy of PET amyloid deposition across participants that resemble neuropathologic observations, and established a fourstage model of amyloid deposition. In their model, the temporal and the parietal regions found in our voxelwise analysis were reported to be affected by stage II amyloid deposits.\nThe present PET study is the first to combine ROIbased parcellation, as defined by an atlas, with an approach free from anatomical a priori (i.e., voxelwise), on relative SUVr measurements. While these two approaches provide further insight into the burden and distribution of amyloid uptake in CAA compared to MCI-AD, the sample size is limited, and again the non-significant difference in the relative occipital florbetapir retention between the two groups may result from underpowered study.\nAlthough CAA patient with pre-existing cognitive impairment were excluded to minimize the risk of accompanying AD pathology, we cannot totally rule out the possibility of pre-clinical AD in some of CAA cases. However, the \"probable CAA\" category of the validated MRI-based Boston criteria we used to define CAA cases have very good sensitivity and specificity. Conversely, in the absence of blood sensitive MRI sequences in subjects with MCI-AD, we cannot fully exclude the possibility of concomitant CAA in subjects with MCI-AD, although MCI-AD patients had no history of cerebrovascular event. Indeed, an autopsies study has reported mild to moderate vascular A\u2424 depositions in more than 80% of patients with AD [20] . In our study, the two CAA-ICH patients with pathological confirmation who had high florbetapir uptakes were reported to have both vascular amyloid and amyloid plaques. The biochemical study of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could help understand better the overlap observed in SUVr analysis between the two groups. However, it is well known that acute vascular lesions can distort the dosage of tau, phospho-tau, and A\u2424 proteins and such analysis remained unreliable. Similarly, although CSF amyloid positivity was required in all patients with MCI-AD, we cannot totally rule out the possibility that a few of them may not have AD, resulting in a negative florbetapir PET [21] .\nDistinct methodological approaches, in terms of protocol adherence and PET image quantification, may lead to different findings. Cortical atrophy may also influence estimations of radiotracer uptake. In this study, to get around this possible bias, we restricted our analyses to the cortex using a grey matter mask for quantification analyses. Taking one further step, one PiB PET study on CAA-ICH patients used post-processing MRI-based partial-volume correction to improve the accuracy of quantification by adjusting for this bias [18] . The effects of such a correction should be investigated in future studies. Another possible factor that might explain the discrepancies between studies is to the time frame in which ICH patients were scanned. Most of the previous PET studies were performed in the chronic phase of ICH. Here, PET scans were acquired in the acute phase of ICH, when intracranial pressure varies and may change cerebral hemodynamics.\nOur findings suggest that global florbetapir retention is lower in patients with CAA-ICH compared to patients with MCI-AD. Relative florbetapir retention in the occipital region tended to be higher in CAA patients but was not significantly different from MCI-AD, based on two complementary analyses of amyloid PET burden whereas patients with MCI-AD had increased amyloid uptake in the temporal and parietal lobe. Despite strict inclusion criteria, a pathological overlap between the two population is the most likely explanation for similarities observed in the distribution pattern of amyloid retention between CAA-ICH and MCI-AD patients. As detailed below, it may be possible that some MCI-AD patients have concomitant CAA pathology that we could not observe in the absence of dedicated MRI sequences. Further larger studies including in vitro amyloid ligand binding in CAA patients are needed to better understand the selective affinity of florbetapir ligand retention. The development of a CAA-specific amyloid tracer is also required [22, 23] ."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "This study pooled data from two clinical research projects on intracerebral hemorrhage and Alzheimer's disease.
