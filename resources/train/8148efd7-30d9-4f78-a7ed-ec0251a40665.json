[{"section_title": "", "text": "diagnosis of this disease for appropriate and quick treatment is important to prevent or at least delay its progress [6] .\nEarly diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease requires the accurate information from patients such as a history of disease, neurological tests, etc. Given the limited time to treat this disease; early diagnosis is critical to prevent its progression. For this purpose, researchers have made many efforts to provide a system that can discover the mechanism and cause of the disease and prevent its development as far as possible. The analysis of various neurological images such as MRI, positron emission tomography (PET), geometric sensitivity gating (GSG), etc., is needed to diagnose Alzheimer's disease [7, 8] .\nThe major challenge in this discussion is the high dimension with the small number of samples in the analysis of brain images. Therefore, machine learning and in their outline, deep learning, has achieved a lot of success. Machine learning methods can overcome these issues (large p, small n). Lately, deep learning in the field of computer, particularly in the analysis of brain images [9] , computer vision [10] , natural language processing [10] , and speech recognition [11] has had a great efficiency as compared to other methods, thus it is considered as a main and powerful tool to analyze the brain images. Generally, the existing methods in these techniques are divided into two categories of dimension reduction and feature selection. Many methods have been proposed to reduce the dimension. These methods by reducing the dimension of the data result in the loss of many features with information load. While, the feature selection methods find features from features with information load and without information load in the main data space. This study was conducted to work on neurological image data from the focus on feature selection techniques.\nIn this study, the proposed method was considered in two stages. In the first stage, sparse filtering learning, which is like a two-layer network was used, to learn the features that characterize Alzheimer's disease. This algorithm can reduce the effect of features without information load and with low information load in feature selection. To remove features without information load, the sparse filtering is implemented into a global mode. Then, in the second stage of learning, SoftMax regression method was trained for automatic classification.\nThe main structure of the paper is as follows."}, {"section_title": "Related work", "text": "By reviewing the literatures on diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, it was concluded that brain data and images with a low sample size and high dimension are one of the most important challenges in this study, and new research can be carried out in this area [12] [13] [14] [15] . Most of the recently used methods are deep learning methods, including deep sparse multi-task learning [16] , stacked auto-encoder [17] , sparse regression models [18] , etc., each attempting to overcome the aforementioned challenges. These methods are used more to select features. In the features of this issue, there are features with information load and without information load that should be selected, which can improve the classification accuracy of the disease. In [17] , a deep architecture for the removal of the features without information load has been recursively proposed by implementing sparse multi-task learning in a hierarchy. The optimal regression coefficients were assumed to reflect the relative importance of the features in representing the target response variables. Also, combined two different conceptual approaches of sparse regression and deep learning to diagnose and predict Alzheimer's disease. Especially, first sparse regression models train some models [18] . Each of these models was trained with different values from an adjustment control parameter. Therefore, multiple sparse regression models potentially select the subset of features from the sum of the main features. Therefore, they have different powers to predict the response values. Another literature [19] , presented a method for representing a linear feature based on SAE's deep learning. The combination of hidden information with the main feature in this article has helped to create an improved model for Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment (AD/MCI) classification with high diagnosis accuracy. In addition, thanks to the unsupervised feature and the pre-training of deep learning, they have been able to use non-related samples with the goal of initializing SAE. There are other methods, which are based on deep learning that uses the convolutional neural network. In [20] , a three-dimensional convolutional neural network was used to predict Alzheimer's disease that can learn general features by taking biological signs and adapt it to the data sets from different domains. Three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) is built from a 3D convolutional auto-encoder that has already been trained to get anatomical changes in brain structure of MRI scans. Hosseini-Asl et al. [21] used the convolutional neural network to build a system for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease in 2016.\nAnother method that focuses on Alzheimer's disease, and its diagnosis are manifold-based learning method. In [22] , manifold-based learning method was used to classify Alzheimer's disease. It has been assumed that manifold space is linear and needs to define the similarity of measurement or the approximation of the graph. In [22] , manifold-based learning was presented based on deep belief network (DBN) to discover similarities in a group of DBN architecture images together with several layers of restricted Boltzmann. This paper is organized as follows: In \"Related work\" section, a method design that includes sparse filtering and SoftMax regression is briefly described. \"Methods\" section describes the two-stage learning method. In \"Proposed method\" and \"Data set\" sections, Alzheimer's disease data set classification was studied using the proposed method. Finally, \"Results and discussion\" section concludes the study."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "The proposed method is as shown in Fig. 1 . A two-stage learning approach was presented. In the first stage of learning, sparse filtering, which is seen as a two-layer network, was used to learn the expressive features of brain images. Then, in the second stage of learning, SoftMax regression, which is also a two-layer network, was trained to automatically categorize the conditions of healthy and unhealthy individuals. Due to the use of the neural network to learn the features, the proposed method is not dependent on prior knowledge and human work and is much more suitable for processing large signals in the field of monitoring the conditions. Here, the classification of Alzheimer's disease from brain images was studied, and the results showed the superiority of the proposed method. AD and MCI classification framework is as shown in Fig. 2 . "}, {"section_title": "Unsupervised learning", "text": "Unsupervised feature learning techniques, such as scattered self-encryptions, limited Boltzmann machines, dispersed coding, etc., are extensively trying to model an approximate fair distribution of collected data. They frequently require tuning different parameters for a platform, which is a major challenge. For example, in a limited Boltzmann machine, the parameters must be set, such as the number of features, weight degradation, dispersion compensation, rate of learning, and amount of movement. When these parameters are adjusted inappropriately, the acquired features may lead to low diagnosis accuracy. Hence, Nigam et al. [18] presented an unsupervised feature learning technique, which is sparse filtering. The main key to the sparse filtering is that the only parameter required is the number of features. Hence, sparse filtering necessarily involves tuning the parameters. Sparse filtering, as an uncontrolled two-layer network, presents dispersed distribution of the features computed by the data collected rather than modeling the distribution of data.\nAssuming the training set of {x i } M i = 1 , where x i \u2208 R N\u00d71 are a sample and M is the number of samples, the sparse filtering of samples is mapped to the features of f i \u2208 R L\u00d71 using the matrix of W \u2208 R"}, {"section_title": "N\u00d7L", "text": ". Here is a situation where sparse filtering calculates the linear feature of each sample.\nwhere, f i l corresponds to the lth feature of the ith sample. The sparse filtering optimizes a function using the normalized feature of l2. It should be noted that the lp norm of t is formulated as\nThe f i l makes the feature matrix. First, each of the rows of the feature matrix is normalized with the l2 norm in all the samples.\nThen, each column is normalized with the l2 norm, so that the features are placed on the l2-ball unit.\nFinally, the weight matrix in Eq. 1 is solved with the optimization of the l1 norm of cost function restriction for each sample, which is as follows:\nThe l2 norm is usually used to measure the dispersion of components and the dispersion means that most of the components are zero. The | f i | 1 word in Eq. (4) measures the features of the ith sample. As the normalized feature of l2 of f i is limited to the l2-ball unit, the cost function in Eq. (4) is minimized when these features are dispersed. Sparse filtering can be converted to a nonlinear filtering using an activation function and the activation function of g(.) = |.| is recommended. Therefore, Eq. (1) is expanded as:\nBy optimizing the cost function of the features in Eq. 5, the trained features can be used to find nonlinear information from the input samples and have good unreliability. More details of the sparse filtering are described in [23] ."}, {"section_title": "SoftMax regression", "text": "In neural networks, Softmax regression is often implemented in the final layer for multiclass classification [19] . Its implementation is easy and quickly calculated. Suppose we have a training set of {x i } M i = 1 along with a labeled set of {y i } M i = 1 , where, x i \u2208 R N\u00d71 and y i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . K} . For each input sample x i , the model tries to estimate the probability of p(y i = k|x i ) for each of the labels of k = 1, 2, . . . , K.\nHence, the assumption of the SoftMax regression produces a vector that gives the K-estimated probability of the input sample of xi belonging to each label. The assumption of h_\u03b8 is as follows:\nnormalizes the distribution, so that the sum of the components of the assumption equals 1. According to the assumption, the model is done by minimizing the cost function of J (\u03b8 ).\nwhere, 1{.} represents the function of the marker which, if it is true, it returns the condition 1; otherwise, \u03bb is the term of weight loss. The term of weight loss forces some Softmax regression parameters to adopt values close to zero, while allowing other parameters to maintain their relatively large values, thereby improves generalize. With the term of weight loss (for every > 0 ), the cost function of J (\u03b8 ) strictly become convex, and the Softmax regression model ensures that theoretically has a unique solution. In addition, Softmax regression is a special solution to the issue of classification, which assumes that the linear combination of features of sample can be used to determine the probability that a sample will belong to any health status label. For example, Softmax regression provides a possible classification."}, {"section_title": "Proposed method", "text": "This section describes the two-stage learning method presented to diagnose Alzheimer's disease. At the first stage of learning, sparse filtering was used to extract the distinct features of the crude brain images, and the learned features of the pixels were obtained by averaging these local features [23] . At the second stage, SoftMax regression was applied to classify the health status of individuals using the learned features. Brain images have been obtained under various health conditions [24] . These images have constructed a\ntraining set of {x i , y i } M i = 1 where, x i \u2208 R N\u00d71 of the ith sample consists of N points of data, and y i is the label of health status. The first learning stage has three stages as shown in Fig. 3 . Firstly, the sparse filtering was trained and the weight matrix of W was obtained. Then, the learned sparse filtering was used to get the local features from each sample. Finally, these local features were averaged to obtain the features learned from each sample.\nSuppose that the input dimension of the sparse filtering is N in , and the output dimension of the sparse filtering is N out . When we are training the sparse filtering model, we randomly sample N s pieces from the training samples. This means that random segments are obtained by the overlapping method. As shown in Fig. 4 , these segments are composed of an unsupervised training set of {s j } Ns j = 1 , where, s j \u2208 R N in \u00d71 is the jth segment containing N in points of the data. The set of {s j } Ns j = 1 is rewritten as a matrix of S \u2208 R N in \u00d7N s and preprocessed by whitening. The goal of whitening is to reduce the correlation between the segments and accelerate the convergence of sparse filtering training. Whitening uses a special amount of covariance matrix.\nwhere, E is the orthogonal matrix of the special vector of the covariance matrix (cov(S)) , and D is a special vector diagonal matrix. Thus, the set of the whitening training segment ( T white ) can be obtained as follows:\nThe sparse filtering model is trained using T white and the trained weight matrix of W is used to compute the local features of the training samples. Alternately, the training samples are divided into J segments, where, J is an integer equal to N /N in , for example, In this paper, the middle method is used instead of the mass method, and the learned features are obtained as follows Averaging is used due to the fact that the distinctive features that segments are shared with each other improves and prevents accidental effects caused by noises. As soon as the learned set of {f j } M j = 1 was obtained, it was trained by the label set of {y j } M j = 1 for training the Softmax regression. The Softmax regression model computes the probability that the fi feature has the health status labels of yi or not, as shown in Eq. (6). The sum of probabilities for all class labels of 1 ensures that the right (equation) in Eq. (6) determines the normalized distribution. After being trained, the former probability in h \u03b8 (xi) determines which health condition labels feature belonging to it."}, {"section_title": "Data set", "text": "The data set used in this paper is from the ADNI 1 standard data sets that are considered in experiments with the cerebrospinal fluid (SCF) and MRI data sets [25] .

It is important to note that the same sample of training and testing was used to compare the existing methods. Table 3 shows the optimal performance of sparse filtering. According to the structure of a sparse filtering model, three hidden layers were considered for MRI, FDG-PET, and CAT11, and two hidden layers were considered for CSF, taking into account the dimensions of low-level features in each method. To determine the number of hidden units, classification of sparse filtering was implemented with the search for network. Due to the likelihood of more connections with a few training samples, the first set up was repeated with a few target samples.

It can be observed that when the number of the segments is high, the accuracy of testing is high and the standard deviation is smaller. It should be taken into consideration that the data segments are unlabeled and are much easier to obtain than the labeled data, which means that the proposed method can use the advantage of unsupervised learning and improve the accuracy of its diagnosis.

While, SP is a neural network in the structural model, thanks to the two-stage training program before training and setting for deep learning, we can reduce the risk of falling into local optima, which is the main limitation of the typical neural network. We believe that deep learning can be a new way to analyze the imaging data, and we presented the application of this method for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease for the first time. Through a case study of Alzheimer's disease Images, it has been suggested that this proposed method adaptively learns the features of raw signals for different diagnostic problems and is superior to the methods available in diagnosing Alzheimer's images. The proposed method is able to utilize the advantages of unsupervised learning and improve the accuracy of its diagnosis, along with an increase in the number of unlabeled data. In future work, the features of neural network weights are studied in depth through the unsupervised feature learning, so that we can fill the gap between manual extraction by using signal processing and feature learning using artificial intelligence techniques. In addition, the application of neural networks in the field of control of diagnostic systems is an attractive subject; therefore, the study of the use of uncontrolled neural network in this area is an attractive subject for future research."}]
