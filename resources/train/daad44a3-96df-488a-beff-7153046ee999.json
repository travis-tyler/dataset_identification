[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Population loss is a critical economic development issue that many nonmetropolitan counties confront. 1 As Kilkenny (2010) posits, some rural areas may lose population to such a degree that they fall below a minimum efficient scale to survive. That is, below a certain population threshold, rural areas may not have the population to support local businesses and to generate enough tax revenue to provide public services (Chen et al., 2013). Although nonmetropolitan counties in the United States as a whole have lost population recently, there is considerable variation in net migration rates across nonmetropolitan counties (Cromartie, 2013;Johnson and Winkler, 2015). Additionally, while firms are drawn to the many agglomeration economies that more densely populated metropolitan areas provide, households appear to prefer a degree of distance from urban areas (Partridge et al., 2010b). Anecdotal evidence from interviews of return migrants to communities in nonmetropolitan areas suggested that the quality of local schools is one factor drawing some in-migrants to some rural communities (Cromartie et al., 2015). However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies of whether school quality could attract new residents to nonmetropolitan counties. While much of the literature on population migration to nonmetropolitan areas focuses on natural amenities or changing economic conditions, the effects of public services in 1 Metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas are defined by the Office of Management and Budget and are a function of population size, adjacency to urbanized areas and commuting ties. For a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of this and other approaches to defining rural areas, see Isserman (2005)."}, {"section_title": "Author Manuscript", "text": "drawing people to nonmetropolitan areas are less well-studied. From an economic development standpoint, the quality of local schools could be an amenity that draws new residents who value it (Tiebout, 1956). Schools in nonmetropolitan areas are also not uniformly at a disadvantage compared to urban and suburban schools, either: there is wide variation in outcomes across rural schools and districts. Many rural districts have higher outcomes at a lower cost than one would expect (Roza, 2015). In addition, spending on schools constitutes a large portion of state and local government spending. Roughly 40 percent of state and local government direct spending in 2014 was in elementary and secondary education (Urban Institute, 2015). This paper addresses the question of whether the quality of public services in nonmetropolitan counties -specifically the quality of public schools --could attract in-migrants. The school quality outcomes we use are the share of persons between the ages of 16 and 19 without a high school diploma or equivalent and not enrolled in school -an approximation of the high school dropout rate -and average proficiency rates on state-level exams in mathematics and reading. Our empirical model uses county-to-county migration flows from the U.S. Census Bureau between 2005 and 2009, data on dropout rates from the 2000 Census, and test scores in reading and mathematics from the Global Report Card. Following Rupasingha et al. (2015), we use an empirical approach that employs the utility maximization theory of migration and an equivalent relation between the conditional logit model and Poisson regression (see also Davies et al. 2001;Cushing and Poot, 2004;Arzaghi and Rupasingha, 2013) to estimate a Poisson regression model with origin county fixed effects. Independent variables control for observed characteristics in the destination counties, including measures of school quality. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the role that local school quality plays in attracting in-migrants to nonmetropolitan counties from metropolitan counties. Our contribution is threefold. First, while there is a large literature on the desirability of good public schools and the capitalization of school quality into property values, most of these studies are limited to specific neighborhoods or cities.

Moreover, the migration effects of amenities in nonmetropolitan areas are usually considered to be natural amenities rather than public services, which are arguably more easily changed than climate, topographic variation, and proximity to water and forests. Second, many papers use education expenditures as a proxy for school quality, yet a separate set of literature indicates that many input measures of school quality are unrelated to outcomes. However, the school quality measures we use in this paper can be considered as outcomes. Third, by modelling county-to-county flows rather than the total number of persons migrating to a county, our empirical approach mitigates potential endogeneity concerns between the quality of local public schools and the number of inmigrants. Results for all three measures of school quality show that better schools can draw migrants to nonmetropolitan areas, suggesting the importance of school quality to variation in migration patterns to nonmetropolitan counties. The results are robust to adjustments made for household income in the counties that school districts are located in and to several other specification changes. Marginal effects are larger for nonmetropolitan counties not adjacent to metropolitan areas, indicating that higher school quality has a stronger effect for more remote areas. We proceed with a review of the literature, predominantly focusing on the relationship between schools and population dynamics in nonmetropolitan areas and nonmetropolitan population change literature. Next, we discuss our model and empirical strategy, with particular attention paid to how it mitigates concerns of potential endogeneity between public school outcomes and in-migration. A discussion of the data follows, including an explanation of how district-level test scores where mapped to nonmetropolitan counties. Results and conclusions are the final two sections of the paper.\n\nresidents in, which is surprising given that several strands of literature point to the economic benefits of school quality. A substantial body of research shows that attending higher-quality schools leads to higher wages. Card and Krueger (1992) assessed the effects of school quality -measured by class size, term length and teacher pay --on men's earnings and found that men born in states with higher school quality earned more after graduating. Murnane et al. (1995) used longitudinal data of American high school seniors to show that basic cognitive skills, measured by scores on mathematics exams -had large effects on wages, especially over time. Hanushek and Woessmann (2008) argued that the quantity of schooling alone is an insufficient explanation for differences in individual earnings as well as country-level economic growth, since attainment of a degree or grade level is an imperfect measure of skills acquired. Instead, they found that the quality of schooling and the cognitive ability of the population -partly measured by international test scores -to be a better explanation of variation in economic outcomes. Estimates of preferences for public services in the economics literature-including education services measured by expenditures or school outcomes -primarily come from discrete choice and hedonic studies. Literature using discrete choice models of residential location rest on the theoretical framework developed by McFadden (1974), where migrants choose the location with the level and mix of public services and other characteristics expected to maximize utility. Detailed data on household or individual migration patterns is required to estimate preferences for public services via discrete choice methods. Despite this requirement, there are a few studies that use survey data, deed information or income and property tax data for particular metropolitan areas to estimate the effects of school quality or school spending on residential choices. Hedonic studies infer the value of school characteristics from home prices and are based on Rosen's (1974) framework of household sorting. These studies are much more numerous than discrete choice models, given the relative abundance of data. Studies using school outcome measures find higher school quality is associated with increased in-migration and increased population growth (Barkley et al., 1998). Rapaport (1997) and Bayoh et al. (2006) are examples using a discrete choice approach, showing that migrants are more likely to move to communities with higher-performing schools. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\nFor example, Bayoh et al. (2006) examined migration between school districts in Columbus, Ohio using a discrete choice model. They found evidence of suburbanization, partly due to changes in job location and lifecycle effects, but also a so-called \"flight from blight\" as migrants moved away from areas with lower school quality and higher crime rates. School quality variables had the strongest effect on in-migration to suburban areas, with a one percent increase in school quality increasing the probability of a destination choice by 3.7 percent. Another approach to estimating the value of school quality is using boundary fixed-effects to estimate the willingness-to-pay for test scores, exploiting houses along district boundaries to ameliorate the effects of omitted variable bias. Gill (1983) and Cushing (1984) pioneered this approach, followed by Black (1999). Positive capitalization effects are found in the literature examining elementary (Bayer et al., 2007;Dogherty et al., 2009;Black, 1999) and secondary schools (Clapp et al., 2008;Dhar and Ross, 2012;Davidoff and Leigh, 2008), and by using boundary fixed effects or traditional fixed effects (Nguyen-Hoang and Yinger, 2011;Clapp et al., 2008). Capitalization studies using hedonic methods can show large effects of school quality on home prices, although efforts to control for omitted variable bias via fixed effects usually reduces the magnitude of estimates. In a comprehensive review of these studies, Nguyen-Hoang and Yinger (2011) found that all studies show a significant capitalization of test scores in housing prices of less than four percent for a one-standard deviation increase in test scores. A potential concern in these hedonic studies is that school quality is likely to be correlated with other public services and amenities. Some studies use instrumental variables (Downes and Zabel, 2002;Gibbons and Machin, 2003) and difference-indifferences (Dhar and Ross, 2010) approaches to address this issue. However, most studies use fixed-effects estimation to reduce omitted variable bias based on district or attendance zones, neighborhoods, school district or attendance zone borders (Fack and Grenet, 2010;Bayer et al., 2007;Kane et al., 2006;Black, 1999). Studies measuring school quality by expenditures yield mixed results. Quigley (1985) and Nechyba and Strauss (1998) \nestimated effects of these public expenditures are negative, though small in magnitude. In a more recent study in Sweden, Dahlberg et al. (2011) found no evidence that education spending affected location choices, although they argue that there is likely less variation in school spending and quality in Sweden than in the United States. Downes and Zabel (2002) used hedonic methods and found no effect of expenditures on home prices. Nechyba and Strauss (1998), on the other hand, found positive effects of per pupil spending on residential choices for a set of six school districts in Camden County, New Jersey. Some hedonic studies found positive effects for expenditures, too, measured in terms of per-pupil spending (Brasington and Haurin, 2006;Dhar and Ross, 2010;Hilber and Mayer, 2009;Brunner et al., 2002). As discussed earlier, though, spending is an input in the educational process, rather than an outcome. Outcome measures such as test scores or dropout rates are preferred when available (Hanushek, 1997;Card and Krueger, 1996).\nTest scores from the Global Report Card are reported at the school district-level. In cases where school district boundaries fall within a county, the translation to county-level test scores is straightforward: an enrollment-weighted average of all school districts within each county is calculated. In cases where school district boundaries cross county lines, the approach is similar, but less precise. Data from the Department of Education's Common Core of Data provides information on the physical location of all public schools in the nation, with information on enrollment and school district. We use this information to calculate school enrollment-based weights of students by district in a county. These weights are then used to calculate weighted averages of district test scores. Our approach introduces the possibility of measurement error when county and school district boundaries overlap. 4 However, our use of the physical location of schools rather than district headquarters mitigates the issue. As a sensitivity check, we estimate our models for the small subset of states where school district and county boundaries coincide. The final school quality variable is the high school dropout rate in a county, measured as the share of the civilian population between the ages of 16 and 19 that are not enrolled in high school, and is taken from the 2000 Population Census. A lower dropout rate has been linked to prosperity in nonmetropolitan areas (Isserman et al., 2009). The advantage of using this measure of high school enrollment versus district or school-level graduation rates from the Department of Education's Common Core of Data is that it is available at the county-level rather than the district-level. State fixed effects are also included to capture -in part -unobserved state education policies that may affect school quality. Following Rupasingha et al. 2015, other independent variables control for economic and noneconomic factors hypothesized to influence in-migration to nonmetropolitan counties. Economic variables include the average county wage and industry-mix employment growth rate to control for the availability of employment. The latter measures exogenous local demand conditions and was calculated using Bartik's (1991) formulation using data from the National Establishment Time-Series Database at the one- It also attempts to capture the notion that employment uncertainty could factor in to migration decisions (Arzhagi and Rupasingha, 2013;Daveri and Faini, 1999;Rosenzweig andStark, 1989, Stark andLevhari, 1982). Per capita taxes and government expenditures attempt to control for public services in general. Median home values are also included to capture housing market conditions. Noneconomic independent variables in the models capture various aspects of geography and demography. Natural amenities have been shown to draw in new migrants to nonmetropolitan areas (Deller et al., 2001;Mueser and Graves, 1995;Knapp and Graves, 1989). Under the Roback (1982) framework, workers may be willing to accept lower pay in exchange for local amenities. The natural amenities scale provided by McGranahan (1999) is used to control for amenity-induced migration. Costs of moving increase as the distance between the origin and destination increase, too. For this reason, distance between county centroids over highways is used in our model along with its square to capture nonlinear effects (Patridge, et al., 2010a;Wu and Gopinath, 2008;Davies et al., 2001). Long distances can also reduce the information about employment prospects in the destination county, making it more difficult for prospective migrants to know if they can find suitable work (Brown and Scott, 2012). Finally, we use the percentage of the population that is 65 years of age and older to capture retirement destination counties (Jensen and Deller, 2007;Rayer and Brown, 2001).\ncounties that are not adjacent to metropolitan areas. The results in Table 4 show the same   series of model specifications as in Tables 2 and 3, except that the sample is differentiated also by the adjacency of destination counties to metropolitan counties using the 2003 rural-urban continuum codes (Parker, 2013). Results in the first three rows are for models of migration from metropolitan counties to nonmetropolitan counties adjacent to a metropolitan county and the last three rows model migration from metropolitan counties to nonmetropolitan counties not adjacent to a metropolitan county. The former may be thought of as migration to the outer suburbs of a metropolitan areas, while the latter are more remote rural counties. All specifications use income-adjusted measures of school quality and the other controls are the same as the baseline specifications in Tables   2 and 3. 5 The high school dropout rate proxy for school quality is highly statistically significant in both adjacent and non-adjacent nonmetropolitan counties, but the marginal effect is greater in non-adjacent counties: -0.558 versus -1.617. Reading test scores are also highly statistically significant, with a marginal effect of 1.11 in adjacent counties and 1.75 in non-adjacent counties. With respect to math test scores, the estimated marginal effects are 0.864 and 1.14 for adjacent and non-adjacent counties, respectively. The results show that higher school quality has the strongest effects in more remote nonmetropolitan counties compared with those in the outer suburbs of metropolitan counties. The relatively larger effects of school quality on migration flows to nonadjacent nonmetropolitan counties could be due to a number of factors. Economic factors could play a less important role than quality of life factors in moves to more remote nonmetropolitan counties from metropolitan areas, given that thinner labor markets are less likely to offer optimal job matches for those seeking work (Mills and Hazarika, 2001;Kim et al., 2000). Migration flows from metropolitan areas to adjacent nonmetropolitan counties could have a higher share of poor movers, given the trend of out-migration of the poor from inner cities to the suburbs (Cooke, 2013).\n\nuse a Poisson regression technique with fixed effects for origin county characteristics to study the migration patterns of people from county to county which is relatively new method in the population migration literature and helps to ameliorate potential concerns of endogeneity between school quality and migration flows. Our results suggest that for the 2005-2009 time period, the quality of schools --as measured by the share of high school dropouts and nationally benchmarked mathematics and reading test scores --had a positive pull effect on migration to nonmetropolitan counties. The estimated magnitudes of the effects of the school quality variables used in the model decrease slightly when adjusted for household income, but maintain signs and statistical significance. Schools with better outcomes appear to draw in new in-migrants, even after taking into account that higher quality schools are more likely to be located in areas with higher median incomes. Findings differentiating destination nonmetropolitan counties by adjacency to metropolitan areas show that school quality is similar to natural amenities in that its effect on predicted in-migration increases for more remote nonmetropolitan counties. Our results are robust to several alternative specifications. Our results contribute two main points for rural development policy. The first concerns the potential benefits of improving education in a nonmetropolitan area. Educational attainment in nonmetropolitan areas has been shown to be correlated with better economic outcomes, such as lower poverty and unemployment rates (Marr\u00e9, 2017). However, this is the first study we are aware of that points to a potential additional benefit; drawing in new residents. Second, the out-migration of young adults from nonmetropolitan areas, also known as the 'brain drain,' is of considerable concern to many nonmetropolitan areas (Carr and Kefalas, 2009;Artz, 2003). Nonmetropolitan areas with higher levels of educational attainment also have higher incomes, but are also susceptible to out-migration due to the higher returns to educational attainment in metropolitan areas (Huang et al., 2002). Regardless of whether the students directly impacted by improved school quality choose to stay or leave the area, our findings show that higher quality schools can continue to attract residents.  Brasington, 2017). However, our methods do not yield guidance on the best approach for particular nonmetropolitan counties to reduce dropout rates and increase test scores. In fact, increased expenditures may not be the only avenue to improving school outcome: some remote rural school districts perform better than others at a relatively lower cost (Roza, 2015). Our results do point to school quality as an important tool in the economic development toolkit for nonmetropolitan locales. The tight linkage between economic and educational outcomes could lead some to argue that good schools are a consequence of economic development rather than a cause. However, our results show that after controlling for economic factors, school quality can have positive effects on population flows, even after adjusting school quality measures for household income. In addition, our research design used a relatively new technique in the population migration literature to mitigate the potential endogeneity between school quality and in-migration. However, while these results are quite strong given the empirical design, one must always caution about results without local fixed effects not being entirely accounted for. Finally, our results point to the fact that the source of migration flows may change the relative importance of school quality for in-migrants. Future research could examine temporal differences in the effects of school quality on inmigration in comparison to economic factors and natural amenities. In addition, as one anonymous reviewer pointed out, the higher performing schools in rural counties can be a cause for higher out-migration of young adults from those counties. The nonmetropolitan counties with higher quality public schools are likely to experience more out-migration of young adults, as many leave to enroll in college or university. New models could be estimated to examine the effects of school quality on in-and out-migration for different age cohorts. "}, {"section_title": "LITERATURE REVIEW", "text": "Theories on the causes of trends in rural population changes may be grouped around key periods of population change: the 1970s and the 1990s. In those periods, the status quo of migration out of nonmetropolitan to metropolitan areas was reversed and nonmetropolitan areas attracted new residents. The 1970s turnaround was thought to be partly caused by macroeconomic conditions such as the oil crisis and recession (Frey and Johnson, 1996), structural shifts of the metropolitan area economies toward services and of the nonmetropolitan areas toward mining and manufacturing (Fuguitt and Beale, 1996), and suburbanization and retiree migration to nonmetropolitan areas (Kim, 1983). Hypotheses on restructuring and changes in economic opportunities were also advanced to explain the reversal in the 1990s of migration to high amenity nonmetropolitan areas (Partridge et al., 2010;Frey and Johnson, 1996;Ghatak et al., 1996). 'Deconcentration' hypotheses again included retiree migration to nonmetropolitan areas (Nelson and Nelson, 2011;Frey and Johnson, 1996), but added migration to nonmetropolitan areas proximate to metropolitan areas for commuting (Partridge et al., 2010;Cromartie, 1998), telecommuting (Nelson et al., 2010, and amenity-based migration (Kahsai et al., 2011;Nelson and Nelson, 2011;Rudzitis, 1999). "}, {"section_title": "MODEL AND ECONOMETRIC APPROACH", "text": "Our model is based on a utility maximization approach following Rupasingha eg al. 2015and Goetz (1999). Prospective migrants maximize utility across a set of alternative locations, j = 1,\u2026,J, compared with the utility derived at their current location, i. Utility is defined as a function of potential earnings in each location, w i or w j , the costs associated with moving from i to j, c ij , and amenities in each location, a i or a j . The quality of local schools can be thought of as a location-specific amenity. Potential migrants evaluate d ij , the difference in utility between moving to location j and staying in the current location i, as shown in equation 1, and moves if d ij > 0 for some j: ( Following the random utility model by McFadden (1974), the choice between any two locations, i and j, can be expressed as a vector of characteristics in both places (X ij ) as shown in equation (2). (2) = \u2032 + . The individual chooses to migrate to the prospective location j that maximizes their utility. Therefore, the probability of a move to location j is defined as: As shown by McFadden (1974), if the are independent and identically distributed following an extreme value type-I distribution, then equation 3can be written as: . Equation 4is typically used to estimate a conditional logit model that is widely used in firm location studies, but has been used only more recently in the population migration literature (Davies et al., 2001;O'Keefe, 2004;Christiadi and Cushing, 2008). Assuming independent observations yields the log likelihood function for all migrants from any county i to a specific nonmetropolitan county j, where d ij =1 if a resident moves and is zero otherwise and n ij is the total number of residents moving from county i to nonmetropolitan county j: Our base model is defined by residential choice from all counties to all nonmetropolitan counties. Therefore, equation (5) becomes: Note that i and j vary based on how origin and destination counties are specified, respectively, by metropolitan status and adjacency. However, estimating a conditional logit model presents two limitations. First, it is computationally burdensome when the number of alternative locations is large. For this reason, many firm location studies have focused on inter-state or inter-region moves, even though there can be considerable variation in the explanatory variables within states. Also, as discussed in detail by Guimar\u00e3es et al. (2003;2004), the conditional logit model requires assuming the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA), namely that locations are equivalent to the location decision-maker after the explanatory variables in the model are controlled for. If there are unobserved location-specific characteristics influencing each firm's location decision, then estimated coefficients will be biased. Guimar\u00e3es et al. (2003;2004) provide an alternative estimation strategy that avoids the potential pitfalls of a conditional logit model for firm location or relocation studies with Author Manuscript large numbers of alternative locations. They showed that given certain conditions, a Poisson regression model may be used as an alternative to a conditional logit model. These conditions result in the log-likelihood functions of both models to be equivalent, such that the model in (6) can be estimated with n ij as the dependent variable and X ij as the independent variables. To see this, assume that n ij are independently Poissondistributed such that: The log-likelihood function of (7) can be written as: Guimar\u00e3es et al. (2003; 2004) show that (8) can be simplified to (9), which is the loglikelihood function of the conditional logit model followed by three constant terms. i.e.,that the ratio of probabilities for any two alternative choices -county A to R and county A to S, for example -is independent of the utility of any other alternative. In other words, the migrating household views locations as similar after the observed characteristics are taken into account so that the error terms are independent across individuals and choices. Guimaraes et al. (2003,2004) prove that this assumption is controlled more effectively by using a Poisson regression technique with location fixed effects. Applications of this approach are not limited to firm migration: it has also been used in the literature to model the urban-to-rural migration of people using a random utility maximization framework (Arzhagi and Rupasingha, 2013;Rupasingha et al., 2015). Following Guimar\u00e3es et al. (2004), fixed effects are used to control for characteristics of the origin counties and explanatory variables are measured for the destination counties. Such an approach has the benefit of controlling for the push and pull factors determining the migration decisions of  2015, is taken from the estimation approach we employ. Rather than the standard cross-sectional approach used in most location and relocation studies, which inevitably raises the prospect of variables being jointly determined, our approach is to model origindestination county pairs. Each individual county pair of in-migration usually makes a small contribution to the total inflow of migrants to a particular county, leading to a small effect on the destination county's overall economy. In addition to endogeneity, it could be argued that the outcome of school districts reflects more than the performance of schools. If school quality is a normal good, then any effect of school quality in drawing new residents may be related to higher incomes in the county, rather than the performance of local schools. We use Chetty et al.'s (2014) approach at addressing this issue, which is to obtain the residuals from regressions of median household income on the school quality variables. In this way the school quality variables are purged of income effects. We estimate our baseline models with both standard and income-adjusted school quality variables."}, {"section_title": "DATA AND VARIABLES", "text": "Descriptive statistics of the variables used in the analysis are presented in Table 1 "}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Our base Poisson models with fixed effects shown in   income.

As in Table 2, higher school quality is associated with increased expected in-migration to nonmetropolitan counties. The high school dropout rate, reading and math test scores are statistically significant. In all cases, the estimated marginal effect decreases slightly by adjusting the school quality measures for household income. A one percentage-point increase in the income-adjusted dropout rate is estimated to decrease expected inmigration by 1.4 percentage points, while a one percentage-point increase in incomeadjusted math and reading test scores yields an estimated increase of in-migration 1.6 and 1.1 percent, respectively.
