[{"section_title": "1.Introduction", "text": "Despite being a severe acute respiratory syndrome, coronavirus disease 2019 can present in various ways not restricted to pulmonary symptoms. A wide range of symptoms has been reported from asymptomatic disease to kidney injuries, cardiac damages, and neurological manifestations. Neurological symptoms, including headache, dizziness, cranial nerves damage such as anosmia, confusion, cerebrovascular diseases, and encephalopathies, can be the initial presentation of COVID-19 or concur with respiratory symptoms. [1] [2] [3] Neurological involvement has been observed in up to 36% of COVID-19 patients. 4, 5 In severe cases, cerebrovascular diseases are among the most prevalent comorbidities and are presented as an independent risk factor for poor prognosis. 6, 7 Preliminary evidence indicates that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection could cause ischemic stroke through hypercoagulative state, endothelial injury, and cardiogenic embolism. 8 Stroke has previously been observed in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) patients. 9,10 Currently, numerous cases of COVID-19 patients complicated with stroke have been reported; some patients had stroke symptoms as the initial presentation. 11, 12 This has raised the recognition of SARS-CoV-2 infection manifesting as a cerebrovascular incident. As SARS-CoV-2 swept through the world, the COVID-19 pandemic has called increasing attention to neurological providers as the novel coronavirus infection causes a higher rate of stroke compared to the regular population. We hereby conducted a literature review and presented current studies, case series, and understanding of COVID-19 and stroke."}, {"section_title": "2.Cohort studies, case series, and case reports of stroke complicated COVID-19 infection", "text": "We have conducted a search of literature through PubMed and Google Scholar with the following keywords \"SARS-CoV-2\", \"COVID-19\", \"stroke,\" and \"neurological symptoms.\" Publications of cohort studies, case series, and case reports of stroke (both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke) complicated with COVID-19 infections have been included from January of 2020 to July of 2020. Studies that were not focused on stoke and Covid-19 infection have been excluded. A total of sixteen studies with authors, journals, publication dates, characteristics, and outcomes are listed. (Table 1) "}, {"section_title": "3.Stroke presentation in COVID-19 Patients", "text": "During the pandemic, a decreased volume of stroke emergencies has been observed by independent institutions across the globe, which has persisted even after the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases decreased. 13, 14 Siegler et al. reported a 38% fall in newly diagnosed stroke patients and 25% fewer consultations via stroke telemedicine at the local institution. 13 This phenomenon has been attributed to the possibility that the fear of contracting SARS-CoV-2 while being exposed to a healthcare facility has deterred patients with mild symptoms from seeking medical attention and treatment. 1, 14, 15 Although further study is warranted to attest to this hypothesis. Additionally, among patients treated for ischemic stroke during the pandemic, Meza The disparity of incidence can be attributed to the small number of samples, timing of the study, and study methods. Of note, both studies targeted COVID-19 patients required treatment in the ICU, which had automatically excluded mild to moderate COVID-19 patients. Therefore, the actual incidence of stroke in COVID-19 patients could be higher. 20 This calls for further investigation as SARS-CoV-2 poses a continuing threat to the neurological well-being of COVID-19 patients.\nIn general, levels of D-dimer, interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, and platelet were increased in COVID-19 patients. 21 Stroke patients with COVID-19 were found to be generally younger with higher admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score than their counterparts without COVID- 19 "}, {"section_title": "4.Mechanism of Stroke in COVID-19 patients", "text": "The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 shares 89.1% similarity with a group of SARSlike coronaviruses. 24 Unsurprisingly, similar to SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor with viral surface spike (S) proteins and gains entry to host cells. 25, 26 ACE2 is widely expressed in human body, 27,28 specifically the neurons, glial cells, endothelial cells, and arterial smooth muscles in the central nervous system. 25, 29, 30 This renders them vulnerable targets to SARS-CoV-2.\nAlthough the neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 is still disputable, the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to ACE2 receptor is 10-to 20-fold higher than that found in SARS-CoV-1, 31 which potentially explains many of the neurological manifestations such as anosmia in COVID-19 infection. The cause of stroke, however, is plausibly multifactorial. Coagulopathy and hypercoagulability as a result of systemic response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, endothelial injury caused by direct viral invasion, and venous stasis due to immobilization are all implicated in CVD in COVID-19 patients.\nCoagulopathy attributes to thrombotic events and has been widely observed in COVID-19 patients regardless of severity. More than 95% of severe COVID-19 patients have elevated levels of D-dimer and fibrinogen. 32, 33 However, classical coagulation markers, prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) are normal or only slightly prolonged and do not reflect the procoagulant state, which is distinct from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). In fact, severe COVID-19 patients rarely progress to an overt DIC. 34 Additionally, antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) were detected in some severe cases, which is associated with thrombosis. 33, 35 Hypercoagulability as well has been reported in both severe and mild COVID-19 patients. Clot waveform analysis (CWA) demonstrated hypercoagulability that precedes or coincides with severe illness. 36 Hypercoagulability, along with a systemic inflammatory response to the viral infection, could lead to macro-and microthrombi formation, ultimately eliciting cerebrovascular incidents. 37,38 A thromboelastography study of the coagulation profile in critical COVID-19 patients yielded consistency with a hypercoagulative state. It's been postulated that substantially increased factor VIII is associated with COVID-19 related hypercoagulability. 37 Activation of the complement pathway, inflammatory cytokines, as well as cytoplasmic microparticles originated from platelets or lymphocytes could also induce hypercoagulative state. [39] [40] [41] Hyperviscosity is another risk factor for thrombosis. This has been demonstrated in a case series of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Fifteen patients had their plasma viscosity assessed with traditional capillary viscometry, which was ranging from 1.9 to 4.2 centipoise (normal range 1.4 -1.8 centipoise). 42 Although it is commonly seen in monoclonal gammopathies, hyperviscosity can be caused by substantially increased fibrinogen, which is consistent with observations in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 rapidly activates immune response through the angiotensin 2 pathway and induces an imbalanced systemic inflammatory cascade, followed by a cytokine storm with high IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1). 43, 44 Apart from direct impairment of organ function, a cytokine storm contributes to hyperviscosity as well. In return, hyperviscosity impairs endothelium and promote hypercoagulative state. 45 Endothelial impairment is evidenced by elevated von Willebrand factor (vWF) and soluble P-selectin in COVID-19 patients as well. Specifically, the elevation of vWF is associated with the severity of the disease. 46 Overexpression of ACE2 in neuronal cells and endothelia prevents the development of ischemic stroke; this protective function is counteracted by the depletion of ACE2 as it serves as the target of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. [47] [48] [49] Autopsy from SARS-CoV-1 have revealed vasculitis of venules in brain tissue. This could be equally true in COVID-19 patients. 50 Through direct viral invasion and inflammatory response, SARS-CoV-2 facilitates endotheliitis, leads to microvascular dysfunction and a procoagulant state, and further increases risks of thrombotic events. Moreover, endothelial dysfunction compounded with anticoagulant treatment and preexisting comorbidities could lead to hemorrhagic stroke and hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic stroke in COVID-19 patients. 16 "}, {"section_title": "5.Management of Stoke amid COVID-19 Pandemic", "text": "Response to stroke code amid the pandemic is challenging due to the potential exposure to COVID-19, requirement of isolation, and relative shortage of healthcare resources. A preplanned protocol is strongly recommended for institutes of different levels. If patients are unable to provide essential information because of altered mental status, aphasia, or few witnesses, screening for COVID-19 could be difficult due to limited history of illness. In this case, stroke patients should be treated as potentially infected, and full personal protective equipment should be implemented. Stroke team members could have been redesignated to meet the increasing need for care of COVID-19, which forces the stroke team to operate with less staff. These all pose a threat to the delivery of healthcare to stroke patients with or without COVID-19. There is a high mortality rate in acute ischemic stroke in spite of timely treatment achieving revascularization. In one series, the mortality rate reaches 31%, while a pooled analysis revealed a dire 50% in COVID-19 patients complicated with acute ischemic stroke. 51 Nevertheless, no efforts should be spared in adhering to published stroke care guidelines. Telemedicine is superior at maximizing social distancing and physical isolation, and it should be made widely available. The NIHSS can be efficiently conducted via telemedicine 52 . It also shortens the time from symptoms onset to initial evaluation.\nCOVID-19 patients with ischemic stroke should undergo a full diagnostic work-up, including brain imaging, vascular imaging, cardiac evaluation. Coagulation profile should be ordered, such as D-dimer, fibrinogen, cytokines, and CRP. 53 In hospitalized COVID-19 patients with high levels of D-dimer indicating hypercoagulative state, anticoagulation therapy can be implemented to mitigate thrombotic complications, including ischemic stroke 1 . Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is recommended for selected patients following guidelines, 54 although the hypercoagulative profile predisposes patients to a higher rate of mortality or disability. 55 Mechanical thrombectomy is recommended for large vessel occlusion within six hours of symptom onset. The challenge lies in the transition from triage to angiographic suite while being compliant with the isolation policy.\nExogenous ACE2 with human recombinant soluble ACE2 is a novel treatment for COVID-19 patients with stroke. It competes with spike protein on SARS-CoV-2 and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infections of the blood vessel, impedes viral related ACE2 depletion on endothelium and preserve its protective function. Collectively, exogenous ACE2 could prevent or reverse direct impairment of endothelial function enacted by SARS-CoV-2. 48 Other treatments targeting the renin-angiotensin system are also under investigation as a promising preventive treatment for stroke in COVID-19 patients. 6.Summary COVID-19 patients have presented with a wide range of neurological disorders, among which stroke is the most devastating. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces coagulopathy, disrupts endothelial function, and promotes hypercoagulative state. Severe COVID-19 infection renders patients bedridden, and in certain cases requiring instrumental support. Collectively, it predisposes patients to cerebrovascular events. Due to the unprecedented strain on the healthcare system, stroke care has been inevitably compromised from initial encounter, treatment, to rehabilitation. The understanding of the underlying mechanism between COVID-19 and stroke warrants further study, so does the development of an effective therapeutic or preventive intervention."}]
