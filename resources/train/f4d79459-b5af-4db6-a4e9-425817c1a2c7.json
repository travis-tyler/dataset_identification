[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "This working paper documents the methods used in the study, Social Science PhDs-Five+ Years Out (\"SS5\"). It describes the survey purpose and administration, sampling methods, and types of data collected. It details items that were collected irregularly. Finally, it provides information helpful for evaluating the generalizability of results. SS5 collected data from PhDs who earned their degrees in U.S. academic institutions between July 1, 1995 and June 30, 1999 in anthropology, communications, geography, history, political science, or sociology. Doctorates were surveyed in 2005-2006, six to ten years after being awarded their PhD, and provided information regarding employment history, career and family factors, graduate school achievements, and the quality and usefulness of their doctoral education. In addition, they answered open-ended questions reflecting on trade-offs between work and family life, experiences with their mentors, advice they would offer beginning graduate students, advice they would give to graduate programs in their field, experiences with diversity, and experiences related to gender, racial/ethnic, class or other personal identities. The resulting data set allows researchers to examine doctoral education experiences within and between spheres of work, and family and relationships. The Center for Innovation and Research in Graduate Education (CIRGE) conducted SS5 with funding from the Ford Foundation. CIRGE, the only U.S. research center devoted to the study of graduate education, is housed jointly in the Graduate School "}, {"section_title": "SURVEY PURPOSE AND GOALS", "text": "Doctoral education in the United States has been criticized for producing too many PhDs who are not well prepared for the work they actually end up doing (Nerad 2004). SS5 was designed in response to these concerns, and its design was informed by ongoing debates about how to evaluate the quality of PhD programs (Aanerud et al. 2006;Goldman and Massy 2001;Golde and Dore 2001;Nerad 2004). SS5 survey goals were: (1) to describe the employment history/career paths of social science PhDs, (2) to evaluate the quality of support, guidance, and mentoring they received in graduate school, (3) to evaluate how well their training prepared them for their jobs, and (4) to demonstrate the feasibility of conducting retrospective surveys of graduates in order to comprehensively assess doctoral programs. The intent was to provide information both to those responsible for PhD programs (including graduate deans, department chairs, graduate education researchers and policymakers) and current and prospective graduate students as they contemplate whether or not to pursue a PhD, how to choose a graduate program, and how to evaluate their own educational experiences and achievements."}, {"section_title": "RETROSPECTIVE SURVEY DESIGN", "text": "SS5 was a self-administered, retrospective web-based survey. Studies of the reliability of recalled information about relationships and family (including spouse characteristics such as spouse's educational level) as well as occupation and employment histories demonstrate that these types of information can be recalled with reasonable reliability (Dex 1995, Klein and Fischer-Kerli 2000, Solga 2001. Moreover, Peters (1988) found that higher education levels were associated with greater recall reliability. Respondents were asked to evaluate their graduate programs six to ten years after receiving their degrees, document their employment histories during the time period from 6 months after receiving their degree until the time of survey, and describe their relationship and family histories from the time of entry into their PhD program until the time of the survey. Both employment and relationship/family histories were collected in a life history format, that is, by asking the respondent to relate all relevant events. Employment history information included the start and end dates of each job, job title (e.g., manager), job sector (e.g., academic), employment status (e.g., full time), and reasons for changing jobs. Periods of non-employment were considered as unique job records, as were positions acquired by promotions (e.g., assistant to associate professor). Overall, respondents entered between 0 and 17 separate work entries. Relationship history was collected through a series of branching questions which were then summarized into a table upon completion, beginning with the question \"What was your marital status when you started your PhD program?\" Subsequent questions asked about each \"change\" in status. Relationship history information included start and end dates of each time period that characterized a relationship (married, or in a committed relationship) or times in which the respondent was single, separated, divorced, or widowed. When applicable, information about the spouse or partner was requested including spouse/partner's educational attainment, field of education, employment status, and employment sector. All changes in relationship status or spouse/partner characteristics were treated as unique records in the relationship history. Program evaluation items were typically asked using likert scales. Respondents rated various aspects of the quality of mentoring received from their dissertation advisor, and a variety of items were used to measure satisfaction with the quality of training received in Finally, open-ended items were used to gather both critiques and recommendations with regard to program evaluations and recommendations for prospective students ."}, {"section_title": "SURVEY SAMPLE", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sampling frame & response rates", "text": "Academic institutions selected for inclusion in the survey were geographically representative of all doctoral recipients nationally in these fields, in this time period (Table  1). Additional guidelines for institutional participation required that the institution offered doctoral programs in at least 3 of the six SS5 disciplines, and that the individual program conferred at least 6 PhDs in the years sampled (AY1996 -AY1999). (A few large doctoral programs were included even though their university did not meet the criterion of offering programs in at least three of the six disciplines.) An effort was made to include a balance of public and private institutions and all regions of the country. The final roster of 65 institutions (see Appendix 1) was influenced as well by the institutions' interest in participating. and SESRC adapted the survey for web administration. The web-based format of the survey allowed respondents to complete the survey in more than one session, if needed. CIRGE provided SESRC with contact information for confirmed eligible doctorate recipients (see above). SESRC sent initial solicitations to targeted PhDs and provided them with unique login names and passwords to access the online survey. Initial contact was by email and proceeded in three waves, with each containing a roughly equal number of contacts. The three waves were timed to spread out the workload of the survey administration team. Each original solicitation was supplemented with up to five additional \"reminders\" as needed. The final reminder contained instructions to alternatively complete a \"short survey\"; a link to this brief version was provided that allowed the respondent to print and mail this short survey to the survey center. Those in the sampling frame for whom a valid email address could not be found were further sought using a variety of online search databases. Data collection began in April 2005 and closed on February 28, 2006. Programming and/or database errors led to failures to capture all survey responses, and two separate efforts were needed to re-contact survey respondents. Five questions (34 items total) were missing for all respondents, while an additional 4 questions (7 items total) were missing for respondents who completed the survey between April 1 and June 20, 2005. See Appendix 2 for details regarding the questions and items affected. The majority of respondents completed a web-based survey (n=2,695). An additional 330 respondents mailed in the short, pencil and paper self-administered questionnaire, with more than half of them (205) providing us with a CV from which key employment data were extracted."}, {"section_title": "SAMPLE DESCRIPTION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of participating institutions", "text": "All participating universities were classified as \"research universities -extensive\" according to the Carnegie classification system. Among the 65 participating institutions (see Appendix 1), 47 (72%) were affiliated with the Association of American University (AAU) and 43 (66%) were public universities. Institutions were well distributed and proportionally representative geographically, including 30% from the northeast and mideastern states and 19% from the western states (see Appendix 3)."}, {"section_title": "Respondent characteristics", "text": "Nearly half of respondents were female (49%), 87% identified as white, and more than two-thirds (69%) were married or in a committed relationship at the time of the survey. The median age at time of PhD award was 34 years, and the median time from entry into their doctoral program to completion was 6.7 years, with a mean of 7.2 years (see Tables 1 and 2). "}, {"section_title": "Non-response analysis & sample limitations", "text": "Because respondents in this study were not randomly selected -only PhDs whom we could locate and who chose to participate are included -we evaluated the resulting sample for response bias. The National Opinion Research Center (NORC) provided information regarding our sample relative to the \"universe\" of potential survey participants (i.e., all PhD recipients during the specified time frame in the targeted disciplines). Overall, a total of 235 U.S. doctorate-granting institutions awarded 15,677 PhDs in one of the six disciplines of interest during the study period targeted by SS5. Two-thirds (n=10,472) of PhD recipients in this time frame received awards from one of the 65 institutions that participated in this study. Ultimately, universities provided information for 6,670 PhDs who were also located in the National Science Foundation (NSF) maintained Degree Record Finder (DRF) database. These recipients constitute our sample frame (see Figure 1 in Appendix 4). NORC matched potential respondents from the CIRGE sample frame to data collected by the Survey of Earned Doctorates to compare characteristics of survey responders to non-responders. The non-response analysis identified several characteristics of survey respondents associated with participation in the survey compared to \"eligibles\" who did not respond (see Table 3). Survey respondents were statistically more likely to be younger, female, white, have a parent with an advanced degree, and be a U.S. citizen. They were less likely to be married at the time they earned the PhD. Respondents had a slightly lower median time-to-degree (8.2 vs. 8.4 years), and they were more likely to have had teaching assistantships (17.1% vs. 15.8%) and grants/fellowships (14.6% vs. 13.8%) as a primary source of support during doctoral study. They were more likely to have definite postgraduate plans; these plans were more likely to be for work in the academic sector (83.4% vs. 80.6%), and more likely to be for teaching (67.3% vs. 65.4%). While these differences are relatively small, readers might consider them when interpreting these data. "}, {"section_title": "Generalizability of survey findings", "text": "A similar analysis was undertaken in order to evaluate the potential to generalize these survey findings to all PhD recipients in the six disciplines included here. Again, information provided by NORC was used to evaluate characteristics of SS5 respondents (n=3025) relative to all PhD recipients who received a PhD in one of the six fields of study in the time frame of interest (n=15,677). Results reveal that survey respondents were disproportionately more likely to be female, white, a U.S. citizen/permanent resident, and unmarried. They were also more likely to have definite post-graduate plans, including academic plans vs. other employment plans. These findings parallel the non-response findings presented above, and suggest that the over-representation of individuals with academic career plans (at time of award) is likely a result of the relative ease in locating individuals who are currently working in the academic sector. Again, this sample limitation should be considered when interpreting these findings, particularly with regard to generalizing the study findings to all social science PhDs."}]
