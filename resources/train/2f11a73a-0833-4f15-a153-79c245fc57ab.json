[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Alzheimer disease (AD) research has mainly focused on neurodegenerative processes associated with the classic neuropathologic markers of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Additionally, cerebrovascular contributions to dementia are increasingly recognized, particularly from cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). Remarkably, in AD brains, the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) e4 allele shows male excess for cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), a marker of SVD, which is opposite to the female excess of plaques and tangles. Mouse transgenic models add further complexities to sex-ApoE e4 allele interactions, with female excess of both CMBs and brain amyloid. We conclude that brain aging and AD pathogenesis cannot be understood in humans without addressing major gaps in the extent of sex differences in cerebrovascular pathology.\nOur biological sex engenders important trade-offs: men have shorter life spans than women, yet while women live longer, they incur more risk of Alzheimer disease (AD) throughout life. Worse yet, the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) e4 allele (see Glossary) risk factor for AD has a definitive female bias. This greater female vulnerability to AD was recognized in two benchmark postmortem studies [1,2]. Both studies showed a female excess of AD pathology (neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles), which was greatest in e4 carriers. Correspondingly, levels of cognitive deficits per unit of brain amyloid show a fivefold excess in women [1].\nIn contrast to a female bias in the classical AD markers, cerebrovascular pathologies, particularly cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), showed a threefold male excess in three independent clinical AD cohorts-the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort [3], the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) [4], and the Karolinska Imaging Dementia Study (KIDS) [4,5].\nCMBs are associated, by imaging and postmortem studies, with amyloid-b (Ab)-containing vessels [cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)], again with e4 bias [6], as well as with hypertensive arteriopathy. Hypertension also shows a male bias (relative to premenopausal women) [7].\nMoreover, we recently reported an ApoE e4 male bias and interaction, for CMBs, in the ADNI and KIDS cohorts (see Figure 1C ) [4]. This is the first indication that cerebrovascular pathology may have a different sex-ApoE allele bias than the aforementioned female bias in AD mechanisms that are considered 'neuron based' because of the neuronal production of Ab. Furthermore, there may be species differences in ApoE e4-sex interactions: By 7 months of age, EFAD transgenic mice carrying human ApoE alleles with familial AD (FAD) genes have a female excess of CMB and CAA, opposite to the aforementioned pattern observed in\nOlder men have a higher risk of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), augmented by the ApoE4 allele. By contrast, EFAD mice show the opposite sex effect, with a threefold to tenfold female excess of CMBs, which dwarfed possible effects of ApoE alleles.\nCerebral small vessel disease is increasingly implicated in cognitive impairment of aging, particularly in conjunction with Alzheimer disease.\nReactive oxygen species (ROS) are mechanistically associated with CMBs in several mouse models. In humans, the limited data also support mechanistic links of ROS to CMBs.\nMost amyloid plaques in EFAD mice include a CMB; similar vasocentric plaques are seen in humans with the Flemish AD variant."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Alzheimer disease (AD) research has mainly focused on neurodegenerative processes associated with the classic neuropathologic markers of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.
