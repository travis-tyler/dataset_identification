An Economic Framework for Community Planners June 2013", "text": "A significant impetus for developing this framework was the growing demand from communities for guidance to help protect publicly-owned infrastructure, such as roads, schools, and sewer systems. However, the holistic approach includes assessing costs and benefits to homes and businesses as well as public assets, and the adaptation strategies discussed in Chapter 2 and Appendix A can be used to protect both private property and public infrastructure. In fact, some of the adaptation strategies are traditionally employed to protect private, but can be viable options to protect public property as well. You can choose to use this framework to perform a more focused analysis of public infrastructure, or to take a broader look at your entire community. The framework can also help communities perform either an impact assessment or a risk assessment. An impact assessment involves assessing the impacts of just a few different water-level increase heights to develop a sense of the amount of damage to expect in certain scenarios compared to the financial cost of adaptation strategies. A risk assessment is a more resource-intensive analysis that multiplies the probability of each water-level increase by the value of the impact to generate an apples-to-apples comparison of the expected costs and the expected benefits of implementing adaptation strategies against coastal flooding. The details of each type of assessment are discussed in task 2 of the first chapter in this guide. Finally, we encourage communities to assemble a team to effectively use this framework, as several of its steps require specialized expertise or training. Identifying qualified experts and engaging stakeholders is an important part of the process. Your team should include economists, planners, GIS experts, land use attorneys, civil engineers, and inundation modeling experts if available; it can also include utility supervisors and emergency managers. If you do not have the needed expertise in-house for all the tasks, seek support from outside resources such as local universities, nonprofit organizations, or consultants. We recommend that communities engage other stakeholders and residents to participate in the decision process. This guide can also be used to help you craft an effective request for proposals to get necessary consultant support.\nChapter 1: Understand Your Baseline Risk This chapter helps you understand your community's baseline risk for coastal flooding resulting from high-water-level events and SLR. You will explore the exposure of your infrastructure to a range of water-level increases resulting from high-water-level events such as storm surge and astronomical high tides combined with SLR. The flood maps that you create will serve as a valuable tool to illustrate what might happen to your community if no action is taken.\nIf your action scenario moves your infrastructure out of harm's way: You will not need to create any new flood maps, since the level of flooding associated with a given water-level increase does not change. When you assign dollar values to the impacts in the next step, the difference in damage between your no-action and action scenarios will be the avoided damage to this relocated infrastructure."}, {"section_title": "Protecting Against Sea Level Rise: New York City", "text": "When hazard planning includes informed decisions, successes can follow. In 2007, New York City began working to prepare for the impacts of climate change as part of PlaNYC-a comprehensive planning effort to address every aspect of the city's physical infrastructure. The effort recognized that adapting to SLR must be a key part of city policy. Accordingly, New York took action to address the most pressing risks; areas of the city were rebuilt, rezoned, and refashioned to better weather those threats. When Hurricane Sandy hit the city in October 2012, many of these changes helped prevent property damage. Governors Island experienced peak flooding of almost 13 feet above sea level and saw 5 feet of water come over the southern seawall, but a 30-acre park there came through the storm nearly untouched because its design accounted for hazards like Sandy.

Again, St. Petersburg, Florida is used as an example, and Table 1.4 illustrates the final output. 1. Determine the lowest rate (in/year) of SLR increase using the NOAA Sea Levels Online mean sea level trend from the water level gauge closest to your community. Assume this to be a constant increase, and use 1992 as the starting point for your calculations; use it to calculate your \"lowest\" projection for the years you chose in the previous step of this process. For St. Petersburg, Florida, the mean sea level trend is 2.36 mm/year, which converts to 0.093 in/year. The rise for 2040 will be 4.46 in (0.093 in/year x ), for 2070 will be 7.25 in (0.93 in/year x ), and for 2100 will be 10.04 in [0.093 in/year x ). Insert these values in the row for the \"lowest\" scenario in Using the highest scenario in the year 2070 as an example, t equals 78 (i.e. 2070 -1992), and the equation would be: This yields a result of 1.08 meters, which converts to 3.54 feet.

Adjust the global \"intermediate-low,\" \"intermediate-high,\" and \"highest\" values calculated in the previous step to account for the difference between your local mean sea level trend and the global mean SLR average (0.067 in/year.) For example, St. Petersburg's local SLR rate of 0.093 in/year is 0.026 in/year above the global average. So for the year 2040, 1.25 inches need to be added to each of the three scenarios ( 0.026 in/year x ).

Use the bolded curve on the graph to determine the water-level increase relative to the mean higher high water (MHHW) level for any storm intensity from the 1-year storm to the 200-year storm. Consider selecting at least the 1-year, 2-year, 10-year, 30-year, 100-year, and 200-year storm in developing this initial table. (Note that \"10-year storm\" refers to a storm that is projected to occur once every 10 years. That is, such a storm has a 10 percent chance of occurring in any given year-it could happen more than once.) See the first two columns of Table 1.6, which show the storm-type and present water-level increases, for a sample of how this table might look. This table presents two SLR scenarios; however, your community may choose to examine more or fewer scenarios in your analysis.\nStep 1: Use water-level increases developed in the previous task and the NOAA Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding Impacts Viewer (where available) to make a reconnaissance-level assessment of the exposed land and infrastructure in your local community. Note that this step is not necessary to the analysis; when available, though, it can provide a useful visual of flooding in your community for 1-to 6-foot water-level increases. Step 2: Determine whether you are interested in assessing the impacts to specific elements of your infrastructure such as a wastewater treatment plant, utility, or hospital (the priority infrastructure approach), or assessing the impacts to your Key considerations for this task: \u2022 Are you interested in assessing the impacts to all infrastructure in your community (holistic approach), or will you be choosing one or two priority infrastructure elements to assess (priority infrastructure approach)? \u2022 What is the complexity of your flooding map, and what are its limitations? Some are simplifications that just consider elevation and would show an area flooding even with a mountain shielding it from storm surge. Others account for this by evaluating how the connectivity of adjacent land parcels affect the flood waters (e.g., hills that prevent the tide from coming further inland. Does your modeling account for wave action? \u2022 What is the resolution digital elevation map data? This will impact the uncertainty of your flood modeling.\nStep 1: Review \u2022 Do your adaptation strategies directly respond to your risks? \u2022 Do your action scenarios range in cost and effectiveness? A wide range of scenarios can establish the foundation for constructive discussions. \u2022 What is the period of effectiveness of your adaptation strategies? Many solutions are only temporary and need to be combined with plans for managed retreat in the future. \u2022 Can a combination of smaller adaptation strategies produce results at least as good as a more expensive adaptation strategy goal? Experts required for this task: \u2022 Land use attorney and planners to help select adaptation strategies in Steps 1 and 2. or implemented, like moving expensive equipment to higher ground in a hospital or other priority infrastructure. While Table 2.1 and Appendix A provide some general, introductory information, there are other factors to consider as you select adaptation strategies that include: \u2022 The costs of strategies can vary significantly depending on the unique characteristics of your community. \u2022 Non-economic factors such as legal challenges or public outreach needs can increase the resources needed to implement a strategy. \u2022 The lifespan and effectiveness of any project will depend on the severity of future events. Keep in mind that some of these adaptation strategies may be more geared to an entire community and others are more applicable to protecting priority infrastructure. Step 2: Based on your list of possible adaptation strategies, develop one or more action scenarios. Each action scenario should consist of at least one adaptation strategy; you may want to combine strategies to enhance the effectiveness of the action scenario.  \nStep 1: Identify how each action scenario changes the coastal flooding impacts for each water-level increase identified in Chapter 1. Determine the impact of each action scenario. For example, does it move your infrastructure out of harm's way to completely prevent flood damage, reduce the frequency of inundation, prevent flooding up to certain water-levels, make the building more resilient against flooding, or combine some of these possibilities? See Table 2.1 and Appendix A for more information about how each flooding adaptation strategy reduces the impact of coastal flooding. Step 2: Re-assess the exposure of your infrastructure for each action scenario. This step's complexity will depend on how your action scenario changes the level or impacts of flooding.\nStep 1: Create a list of primary, secondary, and environmental impacts from flooding using Table 3.1 for input. Keep in mind that impacts will depend on the severity of flooding for certain action scenarios, and some impacts might not exist at all under certain action scenarios or water-level increases. However, for the purpose of this task, develop a single comprehensive list of all impacts that your community might face Key considerations for this task: \u2022 Are there additional impacts not included in the \"Comprehensive Listing of Impacts\" tables below that are specific to your community? \u2022 Do you have internal team members with basic economic understanding to generate a list of impacts or will you need an economist to review your list? Experts required for this task: \u2022 Experienced economists to help you identify impacts in Steps 1-3. under any flooding scenario. If you are only assessing the impacts on priority infrastructure, create a similar list identifying the direct impacts to your infrastructure and resulting secondary impacts. You may want to provide a higher level of detail about the impacts such an inventory of specific content in the infrastructure damaged or components of the infrastructure that would be affected. Step 2: List potential impacts of implementation, both positive and negative, for each adaptation strategy identified in your action scenario. See Table 3.2 for input. Make a separate list of impacts for each action scenario identified in Chapter 2. This step will be similar for both the priority infrastructure and holistic approach. Step 3: Brainstorm whether your community needs to consider any other impacts, not listed in Tables 3.1 or 3.2. Add these to the two lists you developed. This step will be similar for both the priority infrastructure and holistic approach.    Process to complete this task: Step 1: Determine which tools and approaches you will use to monetize your list of impacts. Review Tables 3.1 and 3.2 from the previous task to see the type of impacts each tool or approach can monetize. Review Appendix B, which includes more detailed information about all of the tools and approaches, to learn more about the approach, including a description, general process for performing it, level of effort needed, expertise needed, and important resources. Keep in mind that Appendix B does not list all possible monetization approaches-consult your economic expert for more suggestions. As for many of the comprehensive tools and monetization approaches, you can monetize many primary impacts by answering three questions. \u2022 How high is the water for each flooding scenario? \u2022 How badly will the water damage your priority assets? \u2022 How much is the asset worth? While comprehensive tools often rely on more generic data, they can be quite useful when performing the holistic approach and Key considerations for this task: \u2022 Will you be able to monetize the most significant impacts? These typically include damage to priority infrastructure, buildings, and building contents, and sometimes business or utility interruption. \u2022 Does it make sense for your community to use a comprehensive monetization tool -such as COAST or FEMA Hazus-MH Flooding-when performing this task? These are resource intensive but are sometimes your best option when performing the holistic approach. \u2022 Can you monetize the impacts on your priority infrastructure without using comprehensive tools? Priority infrastructure can be unique, and you will generate more accurate damage estimates by leveraging site-specific data than relying on comprehensive monetization tools that may rely on more generic data. \u2022 Is it possible to quantify any of the impacts that you cannot monetize? Doing so will provide more insight than just considering qualitatively.\nStep 1: Create a timeline outlining the capital and maintenance costs using data outputs from Task 3 in Chapter 3 for each adaptation strategy within each of your action scenarios. might look like for a given action scenario. Create one table for each action scenario. Add a row for each adaptation strategy within an action scenario, as well as rows for total costs, present value of total costs, and NPV of total costs. The column headers will include capital costs and maintenance costs for any year in which you expect maintenance to be performed for any adaptation strategy. Steps 2 to 6 provide further information about where to get data and how to make calculations for this table. Step 2: Add capital and maintenance cost information to this table from your outputs in Task 3 in Chapter 3. Step 3: Calculate the total capital and maintenance cost for each year in your table by summing these costs across all adaptation strategies within a given year. Step 4: Choose a discount rate or multiple discount rates in order to calculate the present value of these costs. Consult your economic expert and Table 4.6 below.\nStep 1: Assess the monetized cost-benefit results of each action scenario.

A risk assessment provides an apples-to-apples comparison of your costs and benefits; however, it requires assessing the impacts of significantly more water-level increases than an impact assessment.\n\u2022 Does your action scenario move infrastructure out of harm's way, reduce the level of flooding for a given water-level increase, or completely prevent flooding up to a certain water-level increase?

Step 3: Decide whether to perform an impact assessment or a risk assessment. The steps in either case are similar, but vary according to your decision-be sure to pay attention when specific steps for your assessment type are called out in each task.

An impact assessment could give you enough information to assess what combination of events could justify the costs of implementing your adaptation strategies. A risk assessment factors in the probability of the storm and will allow you to directly compare your expected total costs and benefits, giving you a clearer answer as to whether your adaptation strategies are worthwhile. The risk assessment does not factor in the probability of an SLR scenario; there are no probabilities associated with each SLR scenario. That is, your community will select an SLR scenario as a given assumption, and perform a risk assessment for each SLR scenario you choose to assess. If you do choose an impact assessment and (on reaching the last chapter of this framework) find that you need more detailed cost and benefit data to make your decision, you can always go back and replicate many of these tasks for more water-level increases to perform a risk assessment.

The specific process you will undertake for each assessment type is outlined below."}, {"section_title": "Option A: impact assessment", "text": "Select three or four water-level increases that represent a range of the values in your table. Consider choosing a low, medium, high, and perhaps catastrophic water-level increase. A low water-level increase may be, for example, an astronomical high tide, a 1-year storm, or SLR only. A catastrophic water-level increase may be, for example, the 200-year storm in 2100 under the \"highest\" SLR scenario or the water-level increase associated with the highest surge that has ever been experienced in your region of the country-Sandy, Katrina, etc. Create a table showing the selected water-level increases (see Table  1.7 for an example) and the associated storm type and SLR scenario combinations represented by those increases. \nCreate a table listing the impacts due to coastal flooding that you plan to quantify or monetize. List the primary, secondary, and environmental impacts that are applicable at each water-level increase for the no-action and each action scenario. Table 3.3 shows how this table can look, however you will input monetized cost data in the next step. Keep in mind that many impacts may only be applicable for higher water-level increases or in a no-action scenario. For example, an action scenario that implements engineered barriers may eliminate impacts at certain water-level increases. If you are following the priority infrastructure approach, you may want to provide more detailed site-specific information than is shown in Table 3.3 such as the specific content in the infrastructure damaged or components of the infrastructure that would be affected at each water-level increase.  \nSum the total of all monetized damage for each water-level increase for the no-action scenario and each action scenario. Table 3.5 provides an example, showing how costs from Table 3.3 were compiled. Option B: risk assessment Sum the total of all monetized damage for each storm type at each year. Create one table for each table developed in the previous step of this process; include a column for the annual probability of each storm type. For example, the 2-year storm occurs on average once every 2 years, so its annual probability is 0.5. Table 3.6 provides an example, showing how costs from Table 3.4 were compiled for a sample no-action scenario. Step 6: Monetize or quantify all of the benefits and other costs that you can from the list you created in Task 1, Step 2 of this chapter. These are typically independent of the water-level increase. You will probably just need to do this once for each benefit or other cost within each action scenario. Internet searches for case studies, or asking other community leaders about their projects. Step 2: Develop estimates for the capital costs, maintenance costs, and timing of each maintenance cost for each adaptation strategy within each action scenario using existing data and parametric software, or by consulting an architectural or engineering firm. Keep in mind that some capital costs will be incurred in the near future and others will not be incurred until later in the planning horizon. Try to get specification details and information about the useful life of each measure. Do not overlook planning costs in the initial capital costs or administrative costs in the maintenance costs.  Chapter 4: Make a Decision Now you will compile the monetized, quantitative, and qualitative data you developed in the previous chapter and decide whether your action scenario makes financial sense-whether the benefits outweigh the costs. If you prepared multiple action scenarios, more than one of them might make financial sense; in that case, you will want to find the best option for your community based on the cost-benefit results, financial feasibility, and other relevant considerations.\nCompare the NPV of total costs calculated in Task 2 of this chapter to the total benefits of each action scenario calculated in Task 1. In Key considerations for this task: \u2022 Did you factor qualitative and quantitative impacts and benefits into your monetized results? These can help you choose the best action scenario or decide whether an action scenario is worthwhile, especially when the monetized results are less conclusive. \u2022 Did you assess the feasibility of paying both capital and maintenance costs in each action scenario? Communities often neglect to plan how to finance maintenance and administrative costs."}, {"section_title": "Option B: risk assessment", "text": "Choose one or more SLR scenarios for which you will assess every water-level increase in the table. For example, for the sample water-level increases in Table 1.6, you will assess water-level increases of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15  feet and 18 feet. In many cases, including this sample case, there is only a small increase in the number of water-level increases that you will need to assess as you consider more SLR scenarios.\nCreate tables, one for the no-action scenario and one for each action scenario for each SLR scenario selected, for the impacts due to coastal flooding that you plan to quantify or monetize. List the primary, secondary, and environmental impacts that are applicable to each storm type and year you selected in Task 2 of Chapter 1. At this point, you may want to modify the years if you choose to change the timeframe of your analysis. You will need a separate set of tables for each SLR scenario you selected. Table 3.4 shows how one table might look for a sample no-action scenario (though at this step you would not yet have included monetized cost data, which is added in the next steps). Keep in mind that many impacts may only be applicable at higher levels of inundation or in a no-action scenario. For example, an action scenario that implements engineered barriers may eliminate impacts at certain water-level increases. If you are following the priority infrastructure approach, you can provide more detailed site-specific information than is shown in Table 3.3. For example, consider including the specific content of the infrastructure damaged or components of the infrastructure that would be affected at each water-level increase.  Step 4: Perform the monetization or quantification, and list the monetized or quantified value next to the impacts in the table(s) you created in the previous step of this process. Step 5 : Create a table similar to Table 3.5 or 3.6 that compiles the total of all your monetized impacts. This table's contents will depend on whether you are performing the impact or risk assessment.\nStep 1: Create tables of the average and\nCalculate the net benefits-the difference in NPV of total benefits calculated in Task 1 of this chapter and NPV of total costs calculated in Task 2 of this chapter. Calculate the benefit-to-cost ratio-NPV of total benefits divided by NPV of total costs. Make these calculations for each action scenario under each SLR scenario.  Step 2: For each action scenario, decide whether the benefits outweigh the costs. As well as the monetized costs and benefits you have just tabulated, consider qualitative and quantitative impacts and benefits. When the monetized results are less conclusive, these considerations may make the difference. (When the monetized results are overwhelming in one direction, on the other hand, they may not affect the outcome.) Also consider the implications of non-monetized co-benefits described in Task 1 of this Chapter. These non-monetized benefits can tip the balance in favor of scenarios with a lower monetized benefit-to-cost ratio, indicating that they may warrant a higher ranking than would be indicated by monetized values alone. Step 3: Assess the feasibility of funding each action scenario that you found to be potentially worthwhile. Determine the feasibility of funding the capital and maintenance costs for each action scenario. Step 4: Rank your action scenarios from best to worst based on the first three steps of this process and any other factors you want to bring into the discussion. 4 Remember to factor in the outcome of the monetized cost-benefit analysis, qualitative and quantitative impacts, and funding feasibility. In the sample data in Table 4.7, for example, action scenario 1 could have the highest net benefits and the second highest benefit-to-cost ratio; however, for many communities, the inability to finance such a measure could make it an inferior option. 4 The FEMA \"STAPLEE\" method is one process for considering a range of factors. This method is designed to help planning teams consider in a systematic way the Social, Technical, Administrative, Political, Legal, Economic, and Environmental (STAPLEE) opportunities and constraints of implementing a hazard mitigation action.

Generally, the tasks will be the same for either approach; however, certain tools and methodologies in this framework are more tailored toward a specific approach. Although the steps in each task will typically be the same either way, be sure to note cases in which a task calls out specific steps for your approach type. Step 3: Determine the exposure, including the depth of flooding relative to the bottom of your infrastructure, for the infrastructure you will be considering in your analysis. While it is not critical to performing this step, it is helpful to understand how much of the water-level increase is due to permanent inundation from sea-level rise as that will impact your community differently from temporary flood from a high-water-level event such as storm surge or astronomical high tides. For both the holistic and priority-infrastructure approach, you might find that flooding levels are relative to one point of reference tool or another method to convert your data to a common reference point if this is the case. This step varies for the holistic and priority infrastructure approach. Option A: holistic approach Once your community understands the severity of your baseline risks from coastal flooding, the next step is to explore how to adapt to these risks. In this chapter, you will develop action scenarios, which will be composed of one or more adaptation strategies to make your community more resilient to coastal flooding. You can assess each action scenario to determine how it alters the severity of flooding in your community compared to your baseline case. This chapter will set the stage for you to apply dollar values to the damage of your no-action and action scenarios in order to arm your community with the information it needs to make fiscally and socially responsible decisions about implementing adaptation strategies.\n\u2022 GIS analysts to help your team use spatial data in Step 2. \u2022 Civil engineers to help assess the effectiveness of your action scenario against coastal flooding.

However, when you are monetizing damage for priority infrastructure, you should use as much site-specific information as possible. Step 2: List the tool or approach you will use to monetize or quantify each impact you listed in Task 1 of the chapter. Otherwise, note that you will only consider that impact qualitatively. Step 3: From the list of primary, secondary, and environmental impacts you plan to monetize or quantify, create tables that show which impacts are applicable at each water-level increase for your no-action scenario as well as each action scenario. This will help you focus on the impacts you need to monetize or quantify at each water-level increase. The contents of these tables will depend somewhat on whether you are performing the impact or risk assessment. The impact assessment approach involves creating one table with a column for each action scenario, whereas the risk assessment approach involves creating a separate table for each action scenario, including the no action scenario for each SLR scenario selected, so that you can assess costs for the different storm types and years selected in Chapter 1. If you performed an impact assessment as part of Chapter 1 Task 2, continue to use Option A. If you elected to perform a risk assessment, continue to follow Option B of this task.\n\u2022 Economists to help you interpret your results in Steps 1 and 2. determining whether an action scenario makes financial sense, consider what types of coastal flooding events must occur for total benefits to outweigh costs.

Alternatively, it might require 10 huge high-water-level events for total benefits to exceed NPV of total costs, perhaps indicating a bad financial decision."}, {"section_title": "Case Study: Hampton Roads, Virginia", "text": "In Hampton Roads, the nation's 35 th largest metropolitan area, the cities of Norfolk and Virginia Beach face starkly different decisions in selecting resilient infrastructure and adaptation strategies in response to higher anticipated sea level rises than any other Atlantic Coast metropolitan area.

"}, {"section_title": "Appendix A: Adaptation Strategies", "text": "The fact sheets in this appendix provide general, introductory information about a variety of adaptation strategies that communities may consider. Many of these strategies could be used to protect either private property or public infrastructure. Some of the strategies are traditionally employed to protect private property but could also be viable options to protect public property as well. This appendix is not intended to be a comprehensive inventory, but rather to introduce a range of strategies that help illustrate varying approaches: managed retreat policies, tidal management, engineered barriers, infrastructure modification/design, land use policy, and green infrastructure. The fact sheets provide an overview of costs, effectiveness, and barriers to implementation. When reviewing these strategies for use in your own community, keep in mind that: \u2022 Costs can vary significantly depending on the unique characteristics of your community and the exact nature of a project or policy, \u2022 Non-economic factors such as legal challenges or public outreach needs can increase the resources needed to implement a strategy, \u2022 The lifespan and effectiveness of any project will depend on the severity of future events. Some fact sheets include special considerations for certain adaptation strategies, but when investigating any potential strategy a community will need to consider a number of factors such as social feasibility, environmental impacts, and administrative and legal aspects. The current state of knowledge pertaining to adaptation strategies is growing rapidly as more and more communities seek and test out solutions to current and future inundation hazards. Communities should seek out additional sources of information to learn more about the strategies contained in this appendix and to identify additional strategies. The resources listed in the \"Key References\" text box in Chapter 2 of this framework as well as those that follow are a few potential sources of additional information: "}, {"section_title": "Fact Sheet A-1: Transfer of Development Rights", "text": "A transfer of development rights (TDR) ordinance provides a way for property owners to transfer development rights from one area to another. In the context of coastal flooding, this can be used as a measure to move future development from vulnerable areas to those that are completely out of harm's way. Additionally, TDR programs can be used to preserve open space, thereby facilitating the implementation of other mitigation measures, such as wetlands development or other green infrastructure to further increase a community's resilience to coastal flooding. TDRs are usually administered through a local government zoning ordinance, with specific districts zoned as either sending or receiving parcels. It is the local government's responsibility to determine the specific number and type of development rights (usually in terms of dwelling units or floor area per acre) that will be transferred. Once the transaction is complete, development rights are legally separated from the first \"sending\" parcel of land and attached to the second \"receiving\" parcel for use by the owner for development. 1"}, {"section_title": "Cost", "text": "TDR is a low-cost option for local governments because they are typically only responsible for the costs of developing and implementing the program through its planning and zoning functions, while the owners and sellers typically pay the costs for the development rights. Sometimes, local governments include transaction fees with the cost of the development rights when they are sold to help offset the costs of administering the program.\nPDR is a mid-price option with a higher cost than TDR but lower cost than a fee-simple acquisition-or outright buyout of the land. Costs for local government include those for developing and implementing the program as well as for purchasing the development rights. Purchase price for the development rights is estimated based on the most valuable use for the land allowed by zoning. For example, if the land is currently used for farming but could be developed for commercial uses based on current zoning laws, then the purchase price is generally based on the commercial value of the land. 2\nRolling easements are typically cheaper than protecting the land. In less developed areas, land owners are more likely to donate easements or sell them for a low price. Rolling easements for more densely developed areas have a higher cost because the land is more valuable and structures will have to be moved or abandoned as the shoreline moves in.\nFee-simple acquisition is a high-cost option. The costs include purchasing the property and structures at fair value from a private owner. These costs are generally paid by local governments and financed by bonds (which can be difficult to implement) or federal or state grants (e.g., FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program.) Grants are sometimes available to help counties acquire important coastal lands. Feesimple acquisition could also reduce property tax generation that had been collected from the purchased structures and/or land.\nCost varies depending on the infrastructure being relocated and can include the cost for new construction, moving lines, or physical relocation, as well as the cost of the land to which the infrastructure is being moved. Large and expensive infrastructure, such as power plants, sewer systems, and water treatment plants, can be very expensive to relocate, while roads and simple buildings are more financially feasible. Regionalization offers a lower cost alternative by having large infrastructure from a neighboring community replace the at-risk infrastructure in your community. With this approach, existing equipment is moved into the new facility, potentially increasing the capacity of the neighboring infrastructure. This could be a more cost-effective strategy for a wastewater treatment plant compared to relocating it because the land and supporting infrastructure (e.g., feeder lines) are already in place.\nSurge barriers tend to have high capital and maintenance costs, although the cost can vary significantly depending on local conditions. In general, movable barriers are more expensive than fixed barriers. Due to the cost, only a handful of movable barriers exist, including the Thames Barrier in London, the Maeslantkering Barrier in Rotterdam, the St. Petersburg Flood Protection Barrier, and the MOSE project in Venice. The costs of these projects varied from $100 million to several billion dollars. Generally, surge barrier construction costs range between $0.7 and $3.5 million per meter, and annual maintenance costs can be about 5 to 10 percent of the capital cost. 6 By preventing the inflow of water to an estuary, closure dams can significantly impact the environment by altering water salinity, temperature, suspended matter, and nutrients, all of which have the potential to affect the local ecosystem. Closure dams also may interfere with the use of the waterways for transportation. Using movable barriers mitigates both these impacts.\nBeach nourishment is a fairly expensive mitigation measure, generally costing between $300 and $1,000 per linear foot, including material, transportation, and construction costs. 8 In addition, the maintenance costs of beach nourishment are substantial, as it must be repeated every few years. Negative environmental impacts are a concern, primarily ecosystem impacts from dredging and burying organisms with the new sand in the area where the nourishment occurs.\nSeawall construction costs range from $150 to $4,000 per linear foot, depending on engineering and construction specifications and local site conditions. 9 In general, the taller and wider the seawall, the more expensive it is to construct. Seawalls also require significant maintenance over the life of the structure. Seawalls can decrease tourism and accompanying revenue, however, if the associated beach is lost.\nWhen land acquisition costs are low, levees are often the cheapest form of hard defense relative to how much protection they can offer. In general, construction can cost between $100 11 and $1,500 per linear foot depending on the height and slope 12 Maintenance costs are also an ongoing requirement to ensure the structure continues to provide appropriate levels of protection.\nSandbagging is generally one of the cheapest methods for flood protection since the bags cost about 25 cents each and are typically filled by volunteers. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimates that constructing a 100-ft long, 3-ft high sandbag barrier would cost about $3,100. 13 Depending on the situation, additional costs may be incurred for the fill material and removal. Sandbagging can be timeconsuming, however, and requires a significant amount of labor.\nIncorporating elevated development into the design of a new house adds $2,000 to $30,000 to the cost of the house depending on its size and foundation type, while raising an existing building can easily be well over double this cost. The total costs for raising a building increase with building size and weight but are not directly related to building size. 16,17 Raising an area of land and/or raising surrounding infrastructure is much more expensive. The cost will vary depending on the amount and type of infrastructure being raised. Raising entire areas of land is very expensive because large amounts of dirt and fill must be transported to the raised site.\nAlthough not a widely used technology, floating development is expected to cost about the same as elevated development. Retrofitting a large and/or old building is often cost prohibitive compared to demolishing and rebuilding, unless the building has historic significance or some other intangible value. 19\nFloodable development can be integrated into facilities at little to no cost for new construction. Costs for neighborhood-level infrastructure to support floodable buildings (for example, a parking garage designed to hold flood water) vary greatly depending on the type and size.\nPrefabricated movable buildings, such as modular homes, are inexpensive to build and relocate relative to the cost of replacement. Costs for both construction and relocation increase significantly with size. Large buildings are generally not designed to be movable because the high cost and complicated logistics involved in regularly moving large buildings makes them cost prohibitive-especially when including the costs for multiple moves. In addition, retrofitting buildings to be movable can be expensive compared to demolishing and rebuilding when you add in the cost of relocation.\nCosts for drainage systems vary according to the area over which they are deployed and the size of flood they are designed to mitigate. Large-scale structural drainage systems, typically composed of concrete and steel, have a high cost that increases relative to the amount of area they are supposed to drain and have a cost on par with other heavily engineered structures. Localized drainage systems that simply drain water from a building or parcel into existing waterways are less expensive to install. In addition, manmade drainage systems require regular maintenance to inspect, repair, and clean the systems after large floods.\nFloodproofing a building is relatively inexpensive compared to other mitigation measures and usually increases the cost of new construction by 0 to 25 percent, depending on the desired level of protection.\nCosts vary depending on land value and the method of preservation. The cost of preserving land in a locality through fee-simple acquisition-or direct purchase-is equal to the assessed property value. Easements average 60 percent of the cost of fee-simple acquisition; a more accurate cost can be determined by calculating the present worth of the highest value land use that would be given up with the easement. 23 There are also maintenance costs and the potential loss of property taxes versus what could be generated if the land were to be developed.\nZoning is a low-cost option. Zoning to mitigate flood-related impacts can be incorporated into a municipality's existing zoning code. The local government bears the cost of developing zoning codes, reviewing development applications for consistency with the code, and enforcing the zoning code. These costs vary by the complexity of the zoning code, the volume of development application, and the area and level of enforcement.\nDevelopment fees are a low-cost option for local governments. The local governments pay for developing and implementing the ordinances and administering the system. Developers pay the fees to pay for infrastructure associated with new development. Development fees typically only cover construction costs, while maintenance or operating expenses are usually funded through taxes.\nCommunities can engage in a variety of activities to conserve, create, enhance, or restore wetlands, and specific costs will vary depending on the scope of the project and local conditions. Land acquisition can be a significant upfront cost. Wetland restoration can cost between $3,500 and $80,000 per acre, excluding land costs, and wetland construction typically costs between $35,000 and $150,000 per acre, excluding land costs. 27 Communities usually face additional costs for planning, long-term management, and monitoring, but maintenance costs are typically very low.\nCreating living dunes is a relatively economical option and can be undertaken at the community level using widely available tools. Locally-appropriate vegetation can be obtained from nursery stocks or from nearby intact dune systems. The most commonly used species in dune transplantation are American beach grass, European beach grass, sea oats, and bitter panic grass. American beach grass is sold in 100stem bundles for approximately $35 to $55 per bundle. 34 The stems are planted two or three to a hole at 1-to 3-foot intervals, resulting in a cost of under $0.50 per square foot of dune. 35 Plantings can be done by hand or with a mechanical planter. 36 New plantings require periodic watering for the first few months and fertilization for up to two years. Decreased access to the beach due to planting vegetation can result in additional costs such as offsetting the loss in access by enhancing or maintaining other beach access points.\nBarrier island restoration is a large-scale undertaking and can cost tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. For example, restoring East Grand Terre Island in Louisiana, which included restoring 2.8 miles and 620 acres of barrier shoreline and 450 acres of marsh by dredging 3.3 million cubic yards of offshore material, cost $31 million. 39 In addition, barrier island restoration projects require periodic maintenance to ensure resiliency."}, {"section_title": "Effectiveness", "text": "TDR can be a highly effective and long-term solution to mitigate impacts of coastal flooding, as long as the development parcels are moved out of harm's way-to higher, further inland, and more protected areas.\nMuch like TDR, PDR is an effective and long-term solution; however, because participation in a PDR program is voluntary for the land owner, the programs can take a long time to implement over a large area. The PDR programs that would be most effective for limiting damage from coastal flooding are those that create large and contiguous areas with permanently preserved open space to serve as a buffer between flooding and development.\nWhen rolling easements lead to the removal of existing structures, they can prevent future flood damages in structure no longer subject to repeated or sustained inundation, but the value of the structure is also lost. Rolling easements are, however, a long-term strategy for potentially discouraging new housing developments along shorelines because they create the expectation that shoreline development will not be protected from flooding and erosion with engineered barriers or other types of coastal armoring. Thus, rolling easements have the potential long-term effect of mitigating future floodrelated damage. Rolling easements can be most effective when implemented along undeveloped stretches of shoreline.\nFee simple acquisition is highly effective because the public owns all rights to the land and can restrict development for as long as it maintains ownership.\nRelocation is effective if the infrastructure is moved out of the vulnerable area. If the infrastructure is not moved completely outside the vulnerable area, the overall effectiveness depends on the exposure and resilience of the infrastructure to coastal flooding.\nSurge barriers prevent storm surges from entering interior areas for water-level increases up to what they are built to withstand. The technology effectively reduces the height of extreme water levels in the area behind the barrier. For movable barriers, a storm surge monitoring and forecasting system must be used to ensure that the barrier is moved into position before a storm surge arrives.\nBeach nourishment is a short-term solution that protects people and property by decreasing the energy of waves and limiting how far inland storm surges travel. Beaches must be supplemented with additional quantities of sand every few years, however, for this measure to continue to be effective. Beach nourishment is very effective against water-level increases up to the beach height; for larger events that greatly exceed the beach height, however, beach nourishment will have a minimal effect on mitigating coastal flooding, and the flooding levels will be similar to what they would be without the measure.\nTo the degree that a seawall is tall enough and strong enough, it can prevent coastal flooding from sealevel rise and storm-surge. If the water-level increase exceeds the height of the seawall, however, substantial coastal flooding will occur, and the seawall might only reduce wave power and water velocity, not flood height. With proper construction and maintenance, seawalls last for 30 years, on average, depending on type of construction and the frequency of extreme weather events. 10\nLevees can provide a high degree of protection against flooding in low-lying coastal areas. Effective levees are built with a high volume of material to resist water pressure, sloping sides to reduce wave energy, and crest heights sufficient to prevent overtopping by flood waters. Levees prevent flooding until they are overtopped with water or are breached (i.e., broken or eroded away), at which point flood waters will rise about as high as they would without a levee.\nSandbags are usually effective at temporarily mitigating flood damage. They are most effective when used to build barriers that are less than 4 feet tall. 14 Taller or poorly constructed barriers can be prone to sliding and overturning. Sandbags are also susceptible to water seeping through or beneath the bags. Sandbags should be used to provide a basic level of protection, but they are unlikely to hold back flood waters entirely.\nElevated development is effective in protecting buildings and infrastructure from floods at water levels lower than the base of the first floor of the raised facility and is generally effective for the expected life expectancy of the structure, which might range from 25 to 50 years.\nFloating development is an unproven technology for modern and dense development. Theoretically, it is effective for protecting buildings from floods at water levels lower than the maximum height to which the building is designed to float. Floating development is designed to be effective for the life cycle of the building.\nFloodable buildings are designed to be effective at preventing structural damage from floods up to a specific height. Supporting floodable infrastructure, such as a water-holding parking garage or pond, can hold a specific amount of water, making it easy to calculate how well the structure will mitigate flooding.\nThe ability to physically move buildings outside of an at-risk area eliminates damage to buildings from flooding. The logistics of moving a large number of buildings are complex, however, because of the time involved. Being able to move buildings requires advance flood warnings as well as sufficient transportation infrastructure to support the movement of both people and buildings.\nWhile building, parcel-sized, and more localized drainage systems can be designed to accommodate specific-size flood events, large and more regional systems are hard to design, integrate, and maintain. As such, the overall effectiveness of these systems is not very predictable.\nUsually floodproofing is designed to reduce but not completely eliminate the amount of damage for a given level of flooding. Floodproofing involves the recognition and acceptance of certain amounts of damage for specific flood levels and is only effective up to these predetermined levels. Dry floodproofing is effective up to a certain water-level increase, after which the force of the water acting on the structure can cause it to collapse.\nFor as long as the open space is preserved, designating vulnerable areas as undevelopable is highly effective at preventing flood-related damage in those areas by reducing the amount of infrastructure that could be exposed. Effectiveness is most often evaluated by modeling the impacts of flooding under different open-space and development scenarios.\nThe effectiveness is directly related to the regulations that the zoning implements and the associated enforcement. For example, preventing any development is highly effective, while requiring raised and flood-proofed structures is moderately effective at preventing future damage.\nDevelopment fees are an effective way for local governments to pay for new infrastructure to mitigate potential future impacts of coastal flooding brought about by new development. Thus, the effectiveness of the development fees depends on the success of the chosen infrastructure at mitigating flooding damage.\nWetlands reduce the risk of property damage and loss of life from flooding through a number of mechanisms. Wetlands act as natural reservoirs, storing flood waters and then slowly releasing them, delaying and attenuating peak flood flows. Wetlands also dissipate wave, wind, and storm surge energy through resistance provided by the wetland vegetation. Studies have found that a loss of one hectare (about 2.5 acres) of wetland corresponds to an average increase of $33,000 in storm damage from hurricanes. 26 However, wetlands are less likely to be effective in mitigating the effects of very large flood events, particularly regional floods of long duration.\nDune vegetation, which acts to stabilize loose sand, is the most reliable way to protect dunes from wind and waves. Dune plants are especially effective at trapping and holding windborne sand, promoting dune growth over time. Dune vegetation also decreases the wind velocity near the ground, reducing wind erosion at the sand surface. 37 Dune vegetation root networks can also help to stabilize the dune. Ultimately, the vegetation helps preserve dunes and enhances their ability to protect the coast from erosion and coastal flooding. Dunes are effective in preventing flooding up until the water-level increase exceeds the height of the dune, or until sufficient erosion occurs to cause the dune to collapse\nBarrier islands protect coastal communities from damage caused by waves and storm surge. Studies have indicated that the loss of barrier islands can increase wave height by as much as 700 percent during fair-weather forecasts. 40 Recent observations following hurricanes have shown that areas behind restored barrier islands weather storms much better than nearby areas. 41"}, {"section_title": "Barriers to Implementation", "text": "TDR can be legally complex to implement and is generally not quickly implemented. For a program to be effective, TDR requires purchaser demand for the development rights as well as willing sellers.\nBecause PDR programs rely on the voluntary participation of land owners, they generally are not quickly implemented. In addition, despite costing less than fee-simple acquisition, development rights can be prohibitively expensive for some local governments and are often tax-funded, which subjects PDR programs to political and economic risk.\nOne method for implementing rolling easements is by obtaining voluntary participation of land owners; this can make the easements difficult to quickly implement, however, because property values are negatively impacted and existing structures cannot be protected with coastal armoring. Additionally, regulatory approaches toward implementation can often be legally complex.\nThe mechanisms for executing and financing fee-simple acquisition can be challenging. If property owners are unwilling to sell, the local government must exercise eminent domain in order to execute the purchase. Additionally, large-scale purchases can be prohibitively expensive for local governments to finance, although grants are sometimes available to help counties acquire important coastal lands.\nSome types of infrastructure (e.g., power, water, and communication lines) are relatively easy to move, while larger structures, such as power plants, large highways, and water treatment facilities, are not. These larger structures also require relocating supporting infrastructure, such as feeder pipes, substations, and distribution lines that connect them to the existing infrastructure. In addition, new utility facilities can require large areas of land and the establishment of new utility lines, which sometimes must be routed through private property.\nSignificant environmental costs as well as impacts on waterway transportation can be substantial barriers to implementation.\nInitial cost and frequent maintenance typically are the largest barriers to implementation. Finding adequate and suitable sand may be a challenge in some areas. Additionally, the question of who pays and who benefits may lead to some outcries about fairness in terms of spending money to protect and potentially increase the value of a small number of beachfront properties. The permitting process could also be slow, given the potential for negative environmental impacts.\nSeawalls require a high capital cost. Additionally, seawalls often elicit a mixed response from local communities because they can actually increase erosion of fronting beaches and adjacent properties and often generate controversy over their aesthetic impacts. Some areas, by regulation, strictly limit or forbid the use of seawalls.\nThe high volume and sloping shape of levees necessitates a large building footprint. This factor will be especially important in areas with high property values. Fact Sheet A-10: Sandbagging Sandbagging is a simple and common way to prevent or reduce flood damage. A sandbag is a sack made of burlap, polypropylene, or other material that is filled with sand or soil. Sandbags are stacked to build temporary barriers to hold back flood waters. The bags can be brought in empty and filled with local sand or soil.\nSandbagging requires a significant amount of labor that must be mobilized quickly before a storm.\nThere are rarely major barriers to implementing elevated development into new construction. Cost to implement, particularly for larger and older buildings, as well as the potential for structural damage, are major barriers to raising an existing building. Creating sufficient access for the handicapped and elderly is also a potential concern. Potential legal liability can hinder being able to raise roads in existing developed areas, because the government entity raising the road is then responsible if drainage patterns are altered and increased flooding results. \nTheoretically, there are few barriers to incorporating floating development into new construction. The main technological constraints are related to building size. Retrofitting an existing building with a floating foundation can be challenging. The process of setting a building on a new and potentially unstable foundation can result in structural damage. 20\nDesign-related challenges are associated with floodable buildings because structures must be engineered to withstand regular flooding. Depending on the size of larger scale retention structures, coordination with multiple public and private land owners as well as other stakeholders may be required to work through large-scale planning or land-use issues.\nThere must be designated receiving areas where the buildings will be relocated. These areas must be out of the flood zone but close enough to allow the buildings to be quickly relocated. In addition, planners will want to consider whether utilities and infrastructure are in place to support the buildings for both temporary and permanent relocation.\nDrainage systems are straightforward to incorporate into development on a local and neighborhood level. Designing effective regional drainage systems can be complex, especially for densely populated areas.\nCost is typically the largest barrier to implementing floodproofing infrastructure.\nThe costs to purchase and manage open space present the most significant challenges to implementation because localities often lack the resources to fund effective open-space preservation programs. In addition, property owners can be unwilling to give up development rights or to sell land in prime waterfront areas.\nProcesses for changing zoning ordinances vary by state and locality. Often, proposed zoning amendments must go through a lengthy review process that includes public involvement as well as approval by a local board or city council. Zoning that restricts development is sometimes a controversial and unpopular strategy, and may lead to legal challenges.\nNot all local governments can enact development-fees because laws and enabling legislation for these fees vary by state. 25\nConstruction of new wetlands may not be well-suited for highly developed areas, where there is often no land available or the land can be costly.\nDunes can sometimes block views of the beach and projects to create new dunes often require landowners to cede some property rights for dune development.\nCost is typically the largest barrier to restoring barrier islands."}, {"section_title": "Special Considerations", "text": "In some cases, a buyer, such as the local government or a nonprofit organization, may purchase the development rights to hold or sell them at a later date. In this case, the buyer could choose to permanently retire the development rights for conservation purposes \nPDR usually only limits future development of housing, commercial, and similar functions; it does not remove existing development on a piece of land and does not prevent all future use of that land. The agreements generally allow the current land owner to stay on the land and, unless explicitly stated, do not prevent other activities, such as mining and farming. \nRolling easements have sometimes been relaxed or removed in future years if the public starts becoming more sympathetic with regard to the destruction of waterfront housing. \nIf local governments choose to pursue this through a forced buyout-or eminent domain-the process, cost, and ability of local governments can vary significantly depending on location. Fact Sheet A-5: Infrastructure Relocation Infrastructure relocation involves moving vulnerable infrastructure to areas less susceptible to coastal flooding. Relocation can be a viable option for many types of infrastructure, including roads, bridges, buildings, utilities, and wastewater treatment plants. Moving infrastructure may involve physically relocating the existing infrastructure, constructing new replacement infrastructure, or otherwise shifting the function of the infrastructure to a different location. One way to shift the function to a less vulnerable area is through regionalization (e.g., expanding capacity at an existing waste water treatment plant in a less vulnerable area to eventually replace another wastewater treatment plant in a vulnerable area).\nRegionalization can be an effective way to move critical infrastructure away from flood-prone areas; however, this approach can also increase the overall level of vulnerability, because if the infrastructure is damaged, the impact will be felt over a larger area. Additionally, relocating critical infrastructure components could limit the accessibility for some vulnerable populations.\nMany closure dams are outfitted with turbines to produce electricity from tidal energy. One concern is that closing barriers might cause additional flooding behind the closure during heavy rainfall because the water would not be able to escape the protected area. Fact Sheet A-7: Beach Nourishment As beaches erode, coastlines move inland, closer to people and property along the shore, and storm surges are more likely to flood coastal areas. Narrower beaches also expose dunes to wave action and erosion, which negates the protection they offer to coastal infrastructure. 7 Beach nourishment, also known as beach replenishment or renourishment, is a common strategy used to combat such erosion and flooding along sandy coastlines. It involves dumping or pumping high-quality sand from an outside source to replace sand lost to erosion. Nourishment typically uses dredges, trucks, or conveyor belts to move sand from one location to the other. By replacing sand lost to erosion, beach nourishment creates a wider beach, which can help mitigate potential damage to coastal property, It can also cause waves to begin to break farther from the shoreline, weakening their strength before they reach the beach.\nBeach nourishment expands the size of beaches, which could lead to increases in beach-related recreation and associated tourism revenues. Nourishment can have an unintended effect of creating a \"false sense of security\" for existing or new property owners who underestimate the vulnerability of areas landward of the beach. Fact Sheet A-8: Seawalls Seawalls are vertical or near-vertical structures built along the coast and designed to prevent erosion and coastal flooding. Seawalls form a protective wall in front of coastal structures and may be constructed from a variety of materials, including concrete, steel, wood, and boulders.\nSeawalls can cause increased erosion (called \"flanking erosion\") in adjacent areas. At either end of a seawall, waves tend to reflect sideways along the shore, causing those areas to erode faster. Fact Sheet A-9: Levees and Dikes Levees, also known as dikes, are constructed embankments designed to reduce the risk of flooding to the areas behind them. Levees are typically built parallel to the course of a river or along coastlines in order to contain, control, or divert the flow of water. Levees are constructed from compacted soil or artificial materials such as concrete or steel. To protect against erosion and scouring, earthen levees can be covered with grass and gravel or a hard surface like stone, asphalt, or concrete.\nDisposing of sandbags after a flood can be problematic. Sandbags that have been exposed to water cannot easily be reused. Wet sandbags tend to start deteriorating after a few weeks and may be contaminated by unsafe materials in the flood water. Disposing of the bags requires a considerable effort and generates a significant amount of solid waste. Fact Sheet A-11: Elevated Development Elevated development involves physically raising infrastructure (e.g., on stilts/pilings or raised land) so that water can temporarily flow underneath and/or around without harming the main structure. 15 Elevated development can be included in the original design or added as a retrofit. Traditionally, only buildings are elevated, while the surrounding infrastructure (e.g., roads, walkways) is not; thus, while a building may be protected from flood damage, access to it may be limited during a coastal flood. It is possible to raise surrounding infrastructure, including roads, bridges, walkways, and utility lines. One common example of elevated development is beach homes that are built on stilts, often with the first floor at a height of 10 feet or more above ground level. Elevating structures is a relatively easy feature to incorporate into the design of a facility or infrastructure during initial construction, but it is more challenging to incorporate as a retrofit. Physically raising a structure that is already elevated slightly (e.g. with a crawlspace) is more feasible than elevating \"slab-on-grade\" construction.\nFloating development is susceptible to damage from wind, waves, and currents from storms. Therefore, it is only effective in relatively protected areas, not in open water along the coastline, which is susceptible to high-energy waves. 18 http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/as-sea-levels-rise-dutch-see-floating-cities/ 19 http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2012/05/preparing-for-a-life-on-water-with-floating-architecture.html 20 http://www.spur.org/publications/library/report/strategiesformanagingsealevelrise_110109 Fact Sheet A-13: Floodable Development Buildings can be designed to allow water to flood the lower floor(s) while causing minimal structural damage to the walls, floors, and foundation. On a larger scale, floodable development can also include structures and green infrastructure designed to capture, retain, and gradually release water when the flood recedes. This helps guide flood water away from more sensitive infrastructure. Examples include large underground storage systems such as parking garages designed to hold flood waters, as well as low-lying fields, ponds, or lakes designed to hold water drained from surrounding areas.\nFloodable development can be hazardous to health, particularly in seaward areas, because floodwater often contains high concentrations of organic chemicals, heavy metals, bacteria, and sediment and could leave behind contamination after the waters subside. 21 21 http://www.spur.org/publications/library/report/strategiesformanagingsealevelrise_110109 \nAdvance planning and early warning are needed to mobilize and coordinate building relocation in advance of a storm or flood.\nTrends for stormwater management increasingly focus on managing flooding and stormwater in place through infiltration and evaporation instead of draining into heavily constructed stormwater infrastructure that quickly moves the water off site. In addition, it is important to consider the downstream impacts of draining off large amounts of water and ensure that draining one area does not lead to damaging floods and erosion downstream.\nWhile floodproofing typically protects against certain water-level increases, these measures do not always account for a high velocity of water rushing in from the ocean, which can destroy structures. \nPreserving open space can also provides valuable social and environmental benefits based on the use of the open space, which may equal or exceed the flood mitigation benefits. \nChanges to zoning amendments generally must be consistent with a local comprehensive or master plan, which describes the long-term land use goals for an area. Changes to the zoning code that are inconsistent with the plan could be subject to legal challenge In the context of flood prevention, development fees could be used to pay for flood-prevention infrastructure or adaptation strategies to prevent flooding in the developed area, or to mitigate the flood-related impacts on other areas that might be caused by the new development.\nIf development fees make the overall cost of development in a particular place higher than in neighboring areas, developers may choose to build in another area or decide not to build at all, which can further increase the effectiveness of the measure in terms of minimizing development in vulnerable areas. Fact Sheet A-20: Wetlands Wetlands are ecosystems that may be saturated with water during all or part of the year and are often found at the boundary between land and water. By absorbing flood waters, wetlands protect inland areas from flooding. Coastal wetlands in the United States have been estimated to provide up to $23.2 billion annually in storm protection services. 26 Communities can take steps to conserve, enhance, restore, or create wetlands in their area. Restoration-returning a degraded or former wetland to its original condition-is typically easier and cheaper to implement than wetland creation, which involves converting either dry land or open water to a wetland.\nWetlands provide a number of other valuable services, including improving water quality, providing fish and wildlife habitats, and maintaining water supplies during drought periods.\nSpecial care must be taken in the selection of plant species to avoid introducing invasive species into the ecosystem. 34 http://www.town.orleans.ma.us/pages/orleansma_parks/whgreport.pdf 35 http://www.whoi.edu/fileserver.do?id=87224&pt=2&p=88900 36 http://140.194.76.129/publications/eng-manuals/EM_1110-2-1100_vol/PartV/Part-V-Chap_7.pdf 37 http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/58856/1/2.5.Olafson.pdf\nIn many cases, barrier islands help shelter wetlands, so restoring barrier islands can indirectly preserve many of the benefits of coastal wetlands. 38 http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/barrier-islands/ 39 http://www.nola.com/environment/index.ssf/2012/01/louisiana_releases_50-year_blu.html 40 Stone, Gregory W. and Randolph A. McBride (1998). \"Louisiana barrier islands and their importance in wetland protection: forecasting shoreline change and subsequent response of wave climate. This approach uses the same basic three-step approach as monetizing infrastructure-level data; however, it provides some lower-resource alternatives if you don't have appropriate infrastructure-level data or are just looking for a quicker means for developing a preliminary estimate of the monetized damage impacts. For example, you may not have data showing the height of water around your infrastructure, which would require you to estimate a depth-damage function, or you may not have infrastructure-level economic valuation data, which might require you to apply a generic economic value such as average building value per square foot or average price per building. Take advantage of your available economic expertise to help you consider and perform alternatives, but remember that more estimates and generic data typically yield less informative and compelling results."}, {"section_title": "Fact Sheet A-2: Purchase of Development Rights", "text": "Purchase of development rights (PDR) involves a local government or nonprofit purchasing development rights while the land remains privately owned. This restricts the future use of a property from certain types of development and is often used to preserve open space or farmland. In the context of coastal flooding, this can be used as a measure to prevent future development from occurring in vulnerable areas. PDRs are usually administered through a local government and often performed in collaboration with a nonprofit or trust that manages preservation activities."}, {"section_title": "Fact Sheet A-3: Rolling Easements", "text": "Rolling easements are enforceable legal agreements that prohibit engineered barriers or other types of coastal armoring and that require removal of structures seaward of a migrating shoreline. 3 Rolling easements ensure that the shoreline will move naturally, and the shoreline is specifically defined (e.g. mean high water, vegetation line, or the upper boundary of tidal wetlands.) As the shoreline erodes or is inundated by sea level rise, existing development that ends up seaward of the defined line must be removed from harm's way. The easements may also potentially discourage future development in these areas. As the shoreline continues to recede, the easement \"rolls\" farther inland. The intent of rolling easements is to allow natural erosion to take place, which preserves natural sediment transport systems, wetlands, and other tidal habitats. 4 Easements can be purchased by a local government, donated by the land owner, or carried out through zoning."}, {"section_title": "Fact Sheet A-4: Fee-Simple Acquisition", "text": "Fee-simple acquisition involves the outright purchase of property and all associated development rights. Fee-simple acquisition is often used when local governments purchase waterfront properties that are vulnerable to erosion and flooding. 5 In the context of coastal flooding, the purpose of the acquisition is to remove or prevent future development in vulnerable areas and to reduce future damage from coastal flooding. Fee-simple acquisitions can be used in conjunction with other managed retreat policies to preserve open space, which in turn can be used to implement other mitigation measures, such as wetlands development or green infrastructure, to further increase a community's resilience to coastal flooding."}, {"section_title": "A-6", "text": "What Will Adaptation Cost?

One of the most common and effective methods of stabilizing coastal dunes is to plant vegetation to create living dunes. Some communities also install fencing and/or use discarded Christmas trees to trap sand that ultimately creates new dunes.

Some GIS experience may be necessary, and economic expertise is recommended for this approach.\nThe level of effort increases as you try to assess infrastructure (business)-level losses. You will need economic expertise for this approach."}, {"section_title": "Process to Perform This Approach", "text": "Step 1: Determine the height of the water around your assets, or at least identify exposed assets. Develop a GIS flood map containing information about which infrastructure elements are flooded, and preferably the depth of flooding around each infrastructure for each water-level increase selected. See NOAA's Mapping Coastal Inundation Primer for more detailed information about creating these mapping layers. An even lower-resource approach would just be to estimate the number or percent of buildings that are inundated from a quick view of your flood map. Step 2: Determine how badly the water damages your assets. Create or find depth-damage curves-functions that show the percent of damage to your assets (in this case building structure or content)-to determine the relationship between water-level height and percent of damage relative to the total value of the asset. Consider using generic depth-damage curves developed by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) (see \"Key Resources\") for many different building types. If your flood map does not contain information regarding the depth of flooding around infrastructure, you may want to try to estimate the average flood depth around buildings and apply the appropriate depth-damage percent to all buildings. Step 3: Determine the value of your assets. Obtain generic economic data about the value of your assets (e.g., average price per square foot, average price per building) that makes sense to apply to your flood map. Only use an estimate of the price per square foot if you can assume how many square feet of the building are flooded. increase the accuracy of your estimate if you can obtain more specific values for different building types, such as the average price per commercial, residential, and industrial building.\nStep 1: Determine the amount of time a business is inoperable. For floods where substantial building damage is expected, the loss of business due to damage or destroyed buildings and equipment may be a substantial component of business interruption. See Table 14.12 of the FEMA Hazus-MH Flood Model technical manual for the expected restoration time of various building types due to flooding. This can help you estimate how long a business may be out of operation after a flood event. It is also possible that the primary business interruption may be caused by inaccessible roads or lack of electricity or water while crews are working to get utilities back up. In this case, you might expect businesses to be inoperable for several days to more than a week while the floodwaters retreat, utilities get back up, and businesses clean up from the flood. In this case, you may want to generate some more general assumptions, perhaps using data from historic storms, for the amount of time you can expect your businesses to be inoperable. Step 2: Determine the wages or output of a business. In Table 14.14 of the Hazus-MH Flood Model technical manual, FEMA provides data about the expected wages, income, and sales output per building type per square foot. You can multiply any of these variables by the number of days a business is inoperable to estimate business loss. Additionally, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages and the Census Bureau County Business Patterns provide data on the number of establishments and employees and total wages by industry type. The BLS data are released sooner and offered at the county level each quarter of the year, while the Census data are annual but offer the advantage of being released at the ZIP Code and county level.
