The heterogeneity of mechanisms leading to vascular cognitive impairment makes developing unifying clinical and research criteria difficult. Recognizing the neuroimaging hallmarks of different forms of vascular cognitive impairment can allow for individualized treatment and management. In individuals with mild vascular cognitive impairment, aerobic exercise appears to be a promising treatment but requires further investigation.\nSUMMARY: Vascular cognitive impairment can be caused by several mechanisms. While treating vascular risk factors is rational to prevent worsening of cognitive impairment, well-designed studies are needed to demonstrate efficacy."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "V ascular cognitive impairment encompasses a range of disorders in which vascular factors cause or contribute to cognitive decline. Our understanding of vascular cognitive impairment has evolved over time. Traditionally, vascular dementia was clinically distinguished from Alzheimer disease dementia by the course of clinical symptoms, history of vascular disease, and focal findings on neurologic examination. Recent evidence suggests vascular brain diseases are a critical part of the expression of Alzheimer disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. Until pathologic data demonstrated that Alzheimer pathology was the most common etiology of dementia, arteriolosclerosis was thought to be the most common cause of dementia, and doctors attributed dementia to \"hardening of the arteries.\" Later, vascular dementia became synonymous with multi-infarct dementia, which was coined by Hachinski and colleagues, 1 who emphasized focal neurologic signs and symptoms and \"stepwise\" cognitive decline.\nAs neuroimaging improved and large pathologic studies were published, a broader range of vascular diseases resulting in cognitive impairment became appreciated. The term vascular cognitive impairment was introduced to incorporate all types of cognitive impairment related to vascular disease, including multi-infarct and other vascular diseases causing dementia, those with mild cognitive impairment not meeting criteria for dementia, and those with mixed vascular and degenerative pathology. 2 "}, {"section_title": "DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR VASCULAR COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT", "text": "The heterogeneity of clinical phenotypes and vascular pathophysiology affecting the brain complicates the development of unifying criteria for vascular cognitive impairment. For many years, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS-AIREN) criteria for vascular dementia were used. 3 These criteria were shown to be specific but not sensitive, with pathologic confirmation. 4 Several newer criteria have been published but require further clinical and pathologic validation. [5] [6] [7] [8] These newer criteria include a mild cognitive impairment stage and propose subtypes based on mechanism. Despite recent efforts to recognize that vascular cognitive impairment rarely occurs in isolation, current diagnostic criteria have a bias toward considering the diagnosis of vascular cognitive impairment as occurring as a sole etiologic agent in a particular patient."}, {"section_title": "CLINICAL PRESENTATION", "text": "No typical clinical presentation exists for vascular cognitive impairment. Patients with large-territory strokes may have a stepwise decline and focal signs (eg, hemiparesis), while those with cerebral small vessel disease may present with an insidious onset of cognitive slowing with gait disturbance and parkinsonism. 9 Patients with a combination of Alzheimer disease and vascular disease may present with an amnestic syndrome that is clinically indistinguishable from pure Alzheimer disease."}, {"section_title": "NEUROPSYCHOLOGY", "text": "No single neuropsychological pattern distinguishes vascular cognitive impairment from other etiologies of cognitive impairment on an individual basis 10 ; however, patterns emerge when studying groups of patients. Patients with vascular cognitive impairment tend to perform worse on tests of executive function compared to memory function. They also have more difficulty with tasks requiring cognitive speed."}, {"section_title": "11", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "EPIDEMIOLOGY", "text": "The epidemiology of vascular cognitive impairment is difficult to study because of the heterogeneity of presentation and limitations of current diagnostic criteria. In the population-based Rotterdam study, which used the conservative NINDS-AIREN criteria, the incidence of vascular dementia was 0.1 per 1000 person-years in those aged 60 to 64 years. 12 The incidence increased with age to 7.0 per 1000 person-years in those aged 90 to 94 years, with a higher risk of vascular dementia in men. In an Olmsted County, Minnesota, population-based study of autopsied dementia cases, 13% had pure vascular dementia and an additional 12% had significant vascular contribution to the pathology, making vascular disease an important component of at least 25% of dementia cases. 13 In a community-based clinical pathologic cohort of dementia participants, 38% had Alzheimer disease and infarcts, 30% had pure Alzheimer disease pathology, 12% had infarcts alone, and 4% had Alzheimer disease with infarcts and Lewy body disease pathology, suggesting a role for vascular disease in up to 54% of dementia cases. 14 Much of the confusion about the frequency of vascular disease contributing to cognitive impairment reflects the difference between the community and clinical cohorts that have been studied. While community-based and population-based studies have shown vascular cognitive impairment as a common cause of cognitive impairment, 14 clinical cohorts generally suggest that vascular cognitive impairment is rare. Referral biases in cohorts from memory clinics appear to systematically underrepresent vascular cognitive impairment, in contrast to population-based studies. For example, a significant difference is seen in the pathology underlying a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease between clinical and community cohorts. Mixed Alzheimer and vascular pathology is more common in the community, and pure Alzheimer disease pathology is more common in clinical/referral cohorts. 15 This was reflected in an autopsy series of 10 university medical centers specializing in Alzheimer disease that found six cases of pure vascular dementia among 1929 autopsied dementia cases. 16 With the advent of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, it became possible to study the frequency of vascular cognitive impairment in the absence of Alzheimer pathology in vivo. In a study of subcortical vascular dementia cases, two-thirds were negative for amyloid deposition, suggesting a vascular dementia phenotype in the absence of Alzheimer disease that can be appreciated antemortem. 17 "}, {"section_title": "Poststroke Dementia", "text": "Many studies have highlighted the association between stroke and the development of dementia. About 10% of patients have dementia before their first stroke, 10% develop dementia shortly after their first stroke, and about 33% develop dementia after a recurrent stroke. 18 In a population-based study, the incidence of dementia after stroke was 9 times greater than expected. Importantly, dementia risk remained double the control population even when dementia was not present the first year after stroke. 19 While cortical infarcts were previously emphasized, emerging evidence suggests subcortical infarcts are important risk factors for cognitive impairment. In a follow-up of the SPS3 (Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes) trial, 47% of participants had mild cognitive impairment. 20 The criteria for poststroke dementia emphasize a temporal association between the cognitive impairment and infarction, often suggesting a 6-month window. 8 While this is helpful in establishing a relationship between the cognitive impairment and vascular disease, numerous studies have highlighted the importance of \"silent\" infarcts (the presence of at least one infarct detected on MRI without a clinical history of an associated stroke or transient ischemic attack) in the development of dementia. Approximately 20% of the population older than 65 years of age have silent infarctions that increase the risk of developing dementia. 21 "}, {"section_title": "VASCULAR COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT SUBTYPES", "text": "O'Brien and colleagues 2 have proposed the following subtypes of vascular cognitive impairment: multi-infarct dementia, small vessel dementia, strategic infarct dementia, hypoperfusion dementia, hemorrhagic dementia, hereditary vascular dementia, and mixed dementia.

Dividing vascular pathologies detected on brain MRI into broad mechanistic categories is another way to categorize them: small vessel disease associated with hypertensive arteriopathy, small vessel disease related to cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and large vessel/embolic disease. Often individuals with vascular cognitive impairment have more than one of these vascular mechanisms present. This division allows individual patients to be classified and interventions to be tailored to mechanism.\nCerebral Small Vessel Disease Associated With Hypertensive Arteriopathy Prior criteria published for subcortical vascular dementia referred to lacunar strokes and white matter hyperintensity in a subcortical pattern. 22 Lacunar stroke and white matter hyperintensity are associated with a hypertensive arteriopathy, although other vascular risk factors such as diabetes mellitus and smoking contribute as well. 23 and decline in motor functioning. 24 They are associated with the increased risk of developing a deep (hypertensive) hemorrhage. They are also associated with risk of ischemic stroke. 25 In patients with Alzheimer dementia, the presence of deep cerebral microbleeds was associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. 26 BASAL GANGLIA (DEEP) MRI-VISIBLE PERIVASCULAR SPACES. The presence of basal ganglia (deep) enlarged perivascular spaces is associated with deep cerebral microbleeds, hypertension-related intracerebral hemorrhage, and increased white matter T2 hyperintensity burden. 27 In one study, increased burden of basal ganglia perivascular spaces was associated with a diagnosis of subcortical vascular cognitive impairment and negatively predicted the diagnosis of Alzheimer dementia. 28 WHITE MATTER HYPERINTENSITIES. White matter T2 hyperintensities are commonly detected on brain MRI and increase with age. The presence of white matter T2 hyperintensities is increasingly recognized as detrimental because of their association with an increased risk of stroke, dementia, 29 and, particularly, worsening cognitive speed and executive function. Noncognitive correlates include risk of depression 30 and gait impairment. 31 Progression of white matter hyperintensity over time is associated with cognitive decline. 32 While white matter T2 hyperintensities are often considered vascular in origin because of the association with vascular risk factors such as hypertension, 33 the location of the hyperintensities is important for understanding the underlying pathophysiology. Hyperintensities in deep regions are more common in individuals with a hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage than in those with a cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related hemorrhage. 34 In patients with Alzheimer dementia, parietal hyperintensity may reflect Alzheimer neuropathology rather than a vascular origin. 35 The cause of white matter T2 hyperintensity can be heterogeneous, particularly in younger individuals with genetic, inflammatory, or radiation-induced changes. Therefore, the presence of white matter hyperintensity should not be considered as definitive evidence of cerebrovascular disease.\nLACUNAR STROKES. While lacunar infarcts commonly occur in the setting of increased white matter T2 hyperintensities, both are independently associated with worse cognition. 36 The location of lacunar infarct is key. Thalamic and putaminal locations are typically associated with a worse cognitive performance than capsular, caudate, and white matter lacunar strokes. 37 While the location of lacunar stroke often predicts the cognitive domain involved, overall incident lacunar infarcts predict decline in executive functions and psychomotor speed. 38 In the Nun Study, participants with Alzheimer pathology were much more likely to develop dementia if they also had lacunar strokes. 39 Small Vessel Disease Related to Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is caused by the pathologic deposition of amyloid-\u03b2 within the walls of cerebral blood vessels, leading to weakening of blood vessels that increases the risk of hemorrhage. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy often occurs with Alzheimer disease pathology but is also a common pathology of aging and prevalent in community-based autopsy studies. 40 While cerebral amyloid angiopathy may be a risk factor for hemorrhagic stroke, it is also associated with cognitive impairment even in the absence of clinical hemorrhage. Severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy pathology is associated with impaired episodic memory and decreased perceptual speed even after controlling for coexisting Alzheimer disease pathology. 40 In the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study, patients with Alzheimer disease with coexisting cerebral amyloid angiopathy had worse cognitive performance that those without coexisting cerebral amyloid angiopathy. 41 Clinical criteria (the Boston criteria) for the diagnosis of cerebral amyloid angiopathy have been developed and modified to include superficial siderosis. 42, 43 Several neuroimaging biomarkers for the presence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy exist and are summarized in FIGURE 7-2, including lobar microbleeds, lobar intracerebral hemorrhage, cortical superficial siderosis, white matter hyperintensity, convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage, and MRI-visible centrum semiovale perivascular spaces.\nLOBAR CEREBRAL MICROBLEEDS. Lobar cerebral microbleeds are an established risk factor for intracerebral hemorrhage. 44 The presence of multiple lobar cerebral microbleeds is associated with increased risk of dementia and impaired executive function and memory. 24 In patients with Alzheimer dementia, lobar cerebral microbleeds are associated with an increased risk of stroke-related mortality. 26 LOBAR INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE. Among individuals without dementia who develop an intracerebral hemorrhage, the incidence of dementia is approximately 28% at 4 years, highest among those with imaging features suggestive of underlying cerebral amyloid angiopathy, including a lobar location. 45 FIGURE 7-2 Spectrum of imaging changes associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA).\nThe association of atrial fibrillation with cognitive impairment varies by the presence of subclinical \"silent\" infarctions. 55 HYPOPERFUSION. Cardiac arrest, carotid occlusion, and hypotension may lead to watershed infarcts (FIGURE 7-6), anoxic brain, or incomplete white matter infarcts, which can result in cognitive impairment.\n\u2022 While multi-infarct dementia was once considered synonymous with vascular dementia, it is now recognized that multi-infarct dementia represents a subset of individuals with vascular cognitive impairment.\n\u2022 Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a genetic cerebral small vessel disease caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene. Cognitive impairment is common in CADASIL, as are migraine headaches and stroke.\n\u2022 T2 hyperintensity involvement of the anterior temporal lobes on MRI may suggest CADASIL as a possible diagnosis.\n\u2022 Cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL) occurs due to mutations in the HTRA1 gene and is associated with alopecia and spondylosis in addition to the cerebral small vessel disease.\n\u2022 Microinfarcts are increasingly recognized as an important contributor to cognitive decline. Recent advances in MRI techniques have allowed a subset to be imaged in vivo.\n\u2022 Treatment of vascular risk factors in midlife, aerobic exercise, and a Mediterranean diet are promising treatments to prevent and treat vascular cognitive impairment but require further investigation."}, {"section_title": "MRI = magnetic resonance imaging.", "text": "CORTICAL SUPERFICIAL SIDEROSIS. Cortical superficial siderosis refers to curvilinear hemosiderin deposition along superficial layers of the cerebral cortex; it is a predictor of intracerebral hemorrhage risk. 46 CONVEXITY SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE.

Centrum semiovale enlarged perivascular spaces occur more commonly in cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related intracerebral hemorrhage than in hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage and are also detected more frequently in Alzheimer dementia than in vascular cognitive impairment. 28 AMYLOID POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY. Amyloid PET has been explored as a biomarker of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and appears to be able to distinguish hemorrhages caused by hypertension from those caused by cerebral amyloid angiopathy. 47 Although preliminary studies of amyloid PET are promising, further studies with pathologic confirmation are necessary before amyloid PET can be used to reliably identify cerebral amyloid angiopathy clinically."}, {"section_title": "Strategic Infarction", "text": "Strategic strokes can be either small vessel (lacunar) or large vessel in mechanism. Targeted strokes can present with cognitive deficits, including memory loss. The cause can often be distinguished from neurodegenerative disease by the time course, which is sudden in onset with vascular causes. The NINDS-AIREN criteria identify several brain regions in key cognitive networks associated with the development of strategic cognitive impairment, including angular gyrus, thalamus (CASE 7-1), basal forebrain, posterior cerebral artery (ie, hippocampus) (CASE 7-2), and anterior cerebral artery (CASE 7-3) territories, which can be injured after rupture of an anterior communicating artery aneurysm. 3 Other regions include the caudate (CASE 7-4) and putamen.

The anterior nucleus of the thalamus receives blood supply from the tuberothalamic artery, which originates from the posterior communicating artery. The clinical phenotype of anterior nucleus infarction is anterograde amnesia with preserved recognition. The amnesia results from interruption of the mammillothalamic tract and its cortical projections. Patients with left anterior nucleus infarction typically have verbal memory difficulty and autobiographical memory impairment, while patients with right anterior nucleus infarction, such as this patient, develop topographic disorientation and visuospatial dysfunction. Patients with anterior thalamic strokes have also been described to develop palipsychism, which is superimposition of temporally unrelated information. 48 This presents as an interruption of current dialogue with previously discussed unrelated topics. subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a genetic cerebral small vessel disease caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene that codes for a transmembrane receptor located on vascular smooth muscle cells (CASE 7-6).\nThis leads to deposition of granular osmophilic material in vascular smooth muscle cells.

The pattern of cognitive deficits on neuropsychometric testing includes impaired cognitive speed, executive function, and attention. 56 MRI reveals significant white matter T2 hyperintensities with ischemic lesions in subcortical regions, including characteristic involvement of the anterior temporal lobe.

Her family members indicated that she was acting \"weird.\" Her email read \"Thank you for getting my mail and for bringing me home. THANK YOU for hauling me home and all my things. Many thanks for coming to get me and hauling my stuff in. I cannot even remember if I thanked you. I do not mean to forget my thanks when you do things that help so much for me.

She was unable to recall four words 5 minutes after they were given to her. She also had a visual object agnosia; despite normal visual fields and intact reading, she was unable to name objects presented to her in the visual sensory modality, but she correctly named them when presented by auditory or tactile sensory modalities.\nMRI revealed an infarction of the left hippocampus as well as the left ventral visual stream (occipitotemporal area) (FIGURE 7-4). When she was seen 6 months later, her memory and visual agnosia had not improved.\nThis case illustrates that strategic infarcts can result from large artery ischemia. This patient developed anterograde amnesia from her hippocampal infarct and the visual agnosia from interruption of the ventral visual stream. leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL), another hereditary vascular dementia syndrome, occurs due to mutations in the HTRA1 gene and is associated with alopecia and spondylosis in addition to the cerebral small vessel disease. 57 Familial cerebral amyloid angiopathy has been described with mutations in the APP, ITM2B (or BRI2), and CST3 genes. [58] [59] [60] Mixed Dementia Mixed dementia is most often seen as combined cerebrovascular disease and Alzheimer disease. As demonstrated by several community-based pathologic cohorts, mixed vascular and degenerative pathology is perhaps the most prevalent important cause of cognitive impairment. The presence of vascular pathology lowers the threshold for the clinical expression of Alzheimer disease. The presence of infarcts interacts with Alzheimer pathology to increase the likelihood of dementia. 61 In the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, the presence of an infarction significantly increased the odds ratio for dementia independently of whether the infarct was symptomatic. 62 The overlap can also be seen in epidemiologic studies in which Alzheimer disease dementia and vascular cognitive impairment share treatable vascular risk factors, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus.\nIn 1985, Damasio and colleagues 49 described the syndrome of basal forebrain injury after anterior communicating artery aneurysm rupture or tumor resection. Patients with this syndrome are able to learn separate modal stimuli but cannot integrate the information. They also develop confabulation. Performance in patients with this syndrome is significantly improved by cuing.\nThis case demonstrates how a strategic stroke can mimic the symptoms of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia. In this patient, a single lesion disrupted the connectivity of the caudate to the frontal lobe, resulting in dorsolateral, medial prefrontal, and anterior cingulate cortical dysfunction that manifested as corresponding disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy, and increased cravings for sweets. \nThis case illustrates the classic presentation of multi-infarct dementia. This patient developed the sudden onset of cognitive problems and had focal findings on examination, with an MRI revealing multiple cortically based infarcts.\nIn this patient, CADASIL was suspected because of her young age, typical MRI findings, and family history. CADASIL can also be diagnosed via skin biopsy to examine the walls of the vascular smooth muscle cells by electron microscopy, which can demonstrate irregular deposits of granular osmophilic material. of microinfarcts after controlling for Alzheimer pathology. 66 In addition, subcortical microinfarcts are associated with declining blood pressure over time. 67 Imaging studies have identified cerebral microinfarcts with 7T MRI.
