[{"section_title": "", "text": "International and domestic discussions about agricultural policy are centered on concerns about the distortions that agricultural subsidies can cause in agricultural markets (e.g., Boschwitz, 1987;OECD, 2001). A key to minimizing trade distortion in domestic policies is to introduce elements into the program that allow farmers to respond to market signals. As part of the 1996 Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act (FAIR), the United States introduced production flexibility contract (PFC) payments that were designed to be somewhat \"decoupled\" from current production decisions (Lin et al., 2000). 1 PFC payments are annual lump-sum cash transfers announced in advance and based on the historical participation of farm land in commodity support programs. Whether or not the payments developed under the 1996 Act are viewed by farmers as coupled or decoupled is central to the international trade discussion on Mary Clare Ahearn and Hisham El-Osta are economists, Economic Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Joe Dewbre is an economist, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The views expressed are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the policies or views of USDA or OECD. The authors gratefully acknowledge the helpful comments of two anonymous reviewers and the Journal Editors. 1 Initially, PFC payments were referred to as \"Agricultural Market Transition Assistance\" payments, and with the passage of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 are referred to as simply \"direct\" payments. Even before 1996, planting flexibility was introduced in farm legislation. For example, the 1990 legislation allowed farmers to respond to market signals on 15-25% of their farm base, with limited penalties for loss of historical base. the World Trade Organization (WTO) classification of U.S. farm payments. Payments that are effectively coupled could affect agricultural output and markets, whereas decoupled payments would not. Understanding the mechanism by which decoupled payments affect agricultural production decisions requires an appreciation for the organizational links between farm businesses and farm households. The early literature in agricultural economics provides such an understanding (e.g., Reid, 1934;Heady, 1952), and the more contemporary literature provides a formal agricultural household model (e.g., Singh, Squire, and Strauss, 1986;Huffman, 1988). The choices made by the farm business-household unit in response to the receipt of PFC payments are likely to include choices about labor allocations. For the policy debate associated with trade distortions and aggregate supply response, the impacts PFC payments have had on-farm labor allocations are of greater interest than impacts on other time allocations (El-Osta, Mishra, and Ahearn, 2004). Interest in off-farm employment originates from a domestic, rather than trade, policy focus. The off-farm labor participation decision is of importance because of the critical role that off-farm income has played, especially in the last three decades, in stabilizing the number of farms in the sector and in providing the major source of income for the vast majority of farm households. The purpose of this article is to examine if, and how, the recent change in the nature of government farm programs has affected the off-farm labor participation of farm operators. We focus on the participation decision, rather than a supply of labor hours decision, because we know that the majority of farmers (85% in 2002) either work full-time off their farm (35 hours or more) or not at all off their farm. 2"}, {"section_title": "Background and Previous Results", "text": "The majority of workers on U.S. farms are the operators and their families, who contribute at least two-thirds of the labor hours worked. Each of the 2.1 million farms in the United States has an operator working on the farm, and approximately 800,000 spouses of operators as well as other family members also contribute labor to the farm (Ahearn, Perry, and El-Osta, 1993). In addition, most farm families have at least one family member working in a nonfarm occupation and receiving more income from off-farm sources than from farm sources. Historically, farm policy was driven in large part by the premise that farm households were economically disadvantaged relative to nonfarm households. However, evidence indicates that has not been the case since at least 1972 (Ahearn, 1986). Off-farm income has played a major role in closing the income gap between farm and nonfarm households and in reducing income inequality among farm operator households (Ahearn, Johnson, and Strickland, 1985;Findeis and Reddy, 1987;Gardner, 1992;Ahearn, Perry, and El-Osta, 1993;Mishra et al., 2002). The Census of Agriculture reports that off-farm income of farm households increased 300% between 1988 and 1998. It also reports that off-farm income was six times that of cash farm income in 1998 (U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2001). USDA routinely collects farm household income and labor allocations data. 3 In table 1, the share of farm households receiving payments and off-farm participation rates are ex-2 Our focus on off-farm participation is further validated by Heckman's (1993) conclusion that empirical evidence on individuals' labor-force participation economy-wide is very important to understanding aggregate labor supply. Empirical results of participation models for farm household members are often stronger than empirical results for work-hours models. For example, Huffman and El-Osta (1997) attribute this conclusion to the greater measurement error in off-farm work-hours data as compared to off-farm participation data. 3 The first survey was conducted as the Farm Operator Resource version of the 1988 Farm Costs and Returns Survey (FCRS) in 1989. amined for the year of the 1996 Act and for a subsequent year when farm households have had more time to adjust to the legislation, i.e., 1999. In 1996, payments were largely the more \"decoupled\" PFC payments, while, in 1999, payments were a mixture of PFC payments, loan deficiency payments, and emergency assistance payments. The off-farm participation rates of farm operators and farm spouses are similar. In 1996, both rates were 43%, and in 1999, 58% of operators and 55% of spouses worked off the farm. Whether a household receives payments or not, the general trend has been for participation in off-farm work to increase overtime. The off-farm participation rate of those operators and spouses who receive payments (about 37-40% of farm households) is generally lower than that for those operators and spouses who do not receive payments. Off-farm participation varies significantly across the farm household population. For example, table 1 reports the rates by the major commodity specialization and the region of the farm. In 1999, almost all cash grain operations received government payments, and their operators were less likely to work off the farm than were the spouses. This was even more the case for those households who specialize in dairies. Only 14% of farm operators operating dairy operations in 1999 worked on the farm, compared to 42% of spouses on dairy operations. In 1999, the operator's off-farm participation rates of the other specialties varied from 51% to 71%. There is less variation in off-farm participation by region than there is by commodity specialization. In several regions-the Lake States, Corn Belt, and Northern Plainsspouses had the same or higher participation rates than did operators, but differed somewhat for the two time periods."}, {"section_title": "Literature on Off-Farm Labor Participation and Supply", "text": "The literature on off-farm labor is well established. Lee (1965) was among the first to extend the standard labor-leisure model to consider the special situation of farm operator households. The primary assumption is that operator's labor is allocated between farm and off-farm activities, such that the marginal value of working on the farm (or reservation wage) equals the wage rate of an off-farm activity. A related extension of the basic laborleisure model is found in the household production literature (see Gronau (1977) for an example and Taylor and Adelman (2003) for a recent review). The empirical literature on estimating off-farm labor covers a variety of issues. Huffman (1980) was the first in the literature to estimate off-farm labor supply/participation models for farm households using aggregate county data. Refinements in the off-farm work literature since then have been extensive, largely using farm household micro data. Of greatest relevance to this article is the literature on how government payments affect offfarm labor decisions. Prior to the 1996 policy change, both El-Osta and Ahearn (1996) and Mishra and Goodwin (1997) indicated that payments were negatively related to off-farm participation. Other refinements in the offfarm literature include: the incorporation of a test for Heckman's sample selectivity bias and analysis with disaggregated data (Sumner, 1982); allowance for the possible lack of independence between utility maximization and profit maximization (Lopez, 1984); treatment of the role played by fringe benefits from offfarm employment (Jensen and Salant, 1986); a recognition of the role of the spouse's or other family member's decision-making (Huffman and Lange, 1989;Gould and Saupe, 1989;Lass, Findeis, and Hallberg, 1989); the inclusion of local labor market considerations (Tokle and Huffman, 1991;Gunter and McNamara, 1990;Lass and Gempesaw, 1992;El-Osta and Ahearn, 1996); the importance of recognizing the jointness in the decision to hire farm labor and the allocation of family labor to farm and off-farm activities (Findeis, 1992;Kimhi, 1994;Huffman and El-Osta, 1997); the use of national off-farm labor participation and wage models in estimating the cost of unpaid farm work in cost of production estimates (El-Osta and Ahearn, 1996); the role of farm income risk in explaining off-farm labor supply (Mishra and Goodwin, 1997;Kwon, Orazem, and Otto, 2003); and the role of state dependency in household labor allocations (Corsi and Findeis, 2000)."}, {"section_title": "Theory of Time Allocation", "text": "Households maximize their utility in considering how they allocate their labor between work and leisure. A key factor in determining the time allocation is the wage rate from working in the marketplace. This market wage rate is the opportunity cost or price of leisure. When an individual chooses to enjoy leisure, rather than work and receive a wage, he or she is giving up that market wage to do so. In the standard labor-leisure model, where an individual receives an increase in nonlabor income, there is no ambiguity in the direction of the impact on labor hours worked, because there is no change in the hourly return from work. An individual will prefer to work less and enjoy more leisure. There is no substitution effect at play; there is only a wealth effect. We know that the impact of the wealth effect is to decrease the hours worked. When an individual receives an increase in the wage rate, it is not possible to predict the direction of the impact on labor hours worked, because there are two opposite effects. First, it can cause an individual to want to work more, because each hour of work now brings a greater return, i.e., a substitution effect. Or, it can cause an individual to want to work less, because he or she can get the same income as before by working less, and have more free time for leisure, i.e., the wealth effect. Whichever effect is greater will determine the impact on the hours of time allocated to work. The standard labor-leisure model needs to be broadened in two ways to consider how a farm household would adjust labor allocations in the face of government subsidies. First, the decision of a farm operator household is a tripartite choice in allocating their time: farm work, off-farm work, and leisure. Secondly, it is important to recognize the nature of the subsidy and how the farm operator household views the subsidy, i.e., as nonlabor or labor income."}, {"section_title": "Farm Work, Off-Farm Work, and Leisure Choices", "text": "The conceptual model combines the decisions of agricultural households relating to producer, consumer, and labor supply into a theoretically consistent model (Singh, Squire, and Strauss, 1986). The individual is assumed to allocate time to farm work, off-farm work, and leisure in such a fashion that the optimal allocation is achieved when the marginal values of time devoted to the activities are equal. The farm operator household is assumed to have the optimization problem: subject to: where P y denotes the price of consumption good Y; L o is home time (leisure) of the farm operator, O, and L s is home time (leisure) for the spouse of the farm operator, S; T is the total time endowment, L is the time allocated to leisure, E is time allocated to off-farm work, F is time allocated to farm work; w is the offfarm wage rate; p f denotes farm output prices, Y f denotes farm output quantities; w f denotes farm input prices, X f denotes farm input quantities, V signifies other household nonlabor income including income from government payments, C is human capital, and R describes location-specific characteristics (e.g., local climate and soils). Equations 4and 5are budget (cash income) and production technology constraints, respectively. After substituting 5into 4, the budget constraint can be written as: The utility function and the production function are assumed to be concave, continuous, and twice differentiable. The first-order conditions for the above model provide many useful results, including the optimality conditions for off-farm work participation."}, {"section_title": "Time Allocations and Government Payments", "text": "The term \"coupled\" payment is used to describe a payment that comes with a requirement that the landowner and/or producer plant a specified commodity in exchange for receipt of the subsidy. This notion of a \"coupled\" subsidy payment is more like an increase in the farm wage rate. The notion behind a \"decoupled\" payment is that producers are not required to produce specific commodities in order to receive a subsidy. Hence, in concept, a decoupled payment is more like receiving nonlabor income. An open debate exists on how to classify government transfer payments for purposes of WTO trade rules. Domestic support is exempted from expenditure limits if it does not have the effect of providing price support to producers, and specific criteria exist for interpreting whether each type of program is exempted from support limits. With the enactment of the FAIR Act in 1996, PFC payments replaced the traditional commodity payments, and were considered exempt from support limits. 4 Besides PFC payments, other payments during the 1990s can be broadly categorized into three categories: market loss assistance (MLA) payments, Marketing Loan Program (MLP) payments, and CRP payments. MLA payments were a series of supplemental emergency assistance payments provided to farmers at various levels following the 1996 Act. Most of these payments were distributed to farmers based on their enrollments in PFC acreage, and averaged about one-third of total payments to the sector during the 1999-2001 period. In addition, some farmers were eligible to receive benefits from MLP, such as loan deficiency payments, and conservation payments, primarily payments under the CRP. The adjustment periods of farmers to a changed policy regime will vary with the policy and the individual. Factors affecting the adjustment include the extent of the change, the regularity of policy changes, and the length of the history of transferring incomes to farmers from nonfarmers. The 1996 Act was passed in April of that year, but it is likely that the general nature of the payments was understood some months before April as the terms of the legislation were being debated. Probably, only those who planted winter wheat in the fall of 1995 would not have had clear signals on the program changes. On the other hand, adjustments cannot be expected to be made instantaneously. For example, some production inputs must be preordered or the land prepared in specific ways, depending on the intended crop. Knowledge of the program changes does not necessarily mean producers are able to immediately respond to the changes; there may be a lag in their response time. Furthermore, by 1998, total payments had nearly doubled due to increases in the loan deficiency payments and emergency assistance payments; and hence, farmers were being sent mixed signals about the extent of decoupling in transfer payments. Questions about operator responses to direct payments are still being considered. Do farm landowners and producers view the direct payments as decoupled payments in their decisions? And, have the impacts of the other payments since 1996 (loan deficiency and emergency assistance) overshadowed the intended lack of market impacts of the PFCs? And of special interest here, do these policy changes play a role in the increase in the off-farm labor participation of farmers who received payments? The majority of farm operator households depend on off-farm work for the majority of their cash income. Hence, even when the primary objective of a policy is to transfer funds to farms while leaving farm output unaffected, any secondary impacts of a policy on off-farm work are critical to the financial well-being of the farm household."}, {"section_title": "Data and Model Estimation", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Description", "text": "The farm household data are from the 1996 and the 1999 Costs and Returns Report version of the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, 2004a). 5 The ARMS, since its inception in 1996, is USDA's primary vehicle for collecting and disseminating data on a wide range of issues about resource use and costs and farm financial conditions. As did its predecessor, the FCRS, the ARMS serves many functions. Generally, it is used to gather information about the relationships between agricultural production, resources, and the environment. It also provides the data for the estimation of production costs and returns of agricultural commodities and in the measurement of net farm income of farm businesses. Yet another aspect of the contribution made by ARMS is the information it provides on the characteristics and financial conditions of farm households, including the information on management strategies and off-farm income. This study also utilizes some auxiliary data. Specifically, the local area characteristics in commuting zones are based on county level data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis income files, the Bureau of Economic Analysis employment files, the Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment files, and the 1990 Census of Population, STF-3 file (U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, 2004; U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, 2004; U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2004). The ARMS data have a complex sample design, complicating the calculation of standard errors and reliable statistical inference (Kott, 1991). However, the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) has developed standards to simplify statistical analysis of the ARMS data, while assuring reliable statistical inference. So, for example, models such as a bivariate probit can be estimated using ARMS data for 1996 and later years. 6 In particular, the procedure (described in more detail below) is a delete-a-group jackknife approach with a replication method (Kott, 1997;Dubman, 2000)."}, {"section_title": "Considerations of Jointness in Model Estimation", "text": "The theoretical model indicates a jointness in the off-farm participation decision of the operator and the spouse. However, the empirical results in the literature are inconclusive about whether or not the participation decision is joint. The estimation in these studies was often done with a bivariate probit model and the studies reported the results of tests for the significance of the cross-equation correlation coefficient for the operator and spouse participation equations. Furthermore, only in the case of Tokle and Huffman (1991) was the sample representative of more than just a small area, e.g., a single state. We chose to model the decision jointly because of the mixed and sparse empirical evidence; this is possible using the data for 1996 and later years. The issue of jointness in the farm operator and spouse participation decision was first addressed in a thorough manner by Huffman and Lange (1989). 7 They provided both an economic model and an empirical model for a 6 This is in contrast to models using the FCRS data for 1995 and earlier years. 7 More evidence for jointness in the operator and spouse decision was found for the off-farm labor supply hours decision. Several of the studies that did not find evidence of jointness in the participation decision, did find evidence of jointness in the labor supply model (Huffman and Lange, 1989; Lass, Findeis, and Hallberg, 1989; Lass and Gempesaw, 1992). sample of Iowa farm households. In the empirical model, they did not find evidence of jointness in the decision of the operator and the spouse to work off the farm. Lass, Findeis, and Hallberg (1989) also estimated an econometric model that allowed for jointness in the operator and spouse decision for a sample of Massachusetts farm households. They, too, did not find evidence of jointness in the off-farm labor participation decision and they found that modeling the decisions independently yielded parameter estimates which were consistent in sign and magnitude with the jointly modeled results. Neither Lass and Gempesaw (1992), in estimating the operator and spouse participation decisions jointly for a sample of Pennsylvania farm households, nor Mishra and Goodwin (1997), based on their analysis with a tobit estimator of a sample of Kansas farm households, found any evidence of jointness. In contrast to the studies referenced above, Gould and Saupe (1989), Tokle and Huffman (1991), Kimhi (1994), Kwon, Orazem, and Otto (2003), and Kimhi (2004), did find some evidence that the off-farm participation decision of operators and spouses was jointly determined. Gould and Saupe (1989) estimated a participation model for Wisconsin farm households in two periods, 1982 and 1986. The crossequation correlation coefficient was significant at the 5% level for one of those years, 1986. Tokle and Huffman (1991) estimated a participation model for a sample of farm resident households from 42 states. The Kimhi analyses (1994 and2004) were for samples of Israeli farm households (in 1981 and 1995) organized as semi-cooperative villages, or moshavim, an institutional structure very distinct from the structure of U.S. farm households. 8 Recently, Kwon, Orazem, and Otto (2003) estimated a participation model for a sample of 266 Iowa farm households and analyzed how unanticipated farm income shocks affect the household's allocation to work time off the farm. Another issue of jointness arises with the decision to participate in government programs and choices about labor allocations. However, historically, participation in commodity programs has been very high (up to 90% of eligible acres), and since the passage of FAIR, nearly all eligible acres have been enrolled in the program. One could also argue that payments should enter the model as predicted payments, rather than actual payments. Given our core interest in identifying any potential differing impacts among the various government programs, allowing the programs to enter the model separately was essential. However, technically, it was not possible to predict the three payment types individually. This is because, they would need to have unique model specifications and realistically the models could not be independently specified. Hence, government payments entered the model as actual payments. 9"}, {"section_title": "Estimation", "text": "With regard to the decision to participate in the off-farm labor market, rational individuals are expected to participate when their reservation wage (w r ) for farm and leisure is less than the off-farm wage rate offered (w). Let the following bivariate probit model (see Greene, 2002) describe the off-farm work choices of the operator and the spouse: where X 1 and X 2 are vectors of exogenous variables, \u2424 1 and \u2424 2 are vectors of parameters to be estimated, \u03b5 1 and \u03b5 2 are vectors of error terms, and is the coefficient of correlation between \u03b5 1 and \u03b5 2 . The probability of an individual participating in the off-farm labor market depends on all of the exogenous variables that enter his or her reservation wage and off-farm wage equations. Variables that increase the off-farm wage rate increase the probability of off-farm work and vice versa for variables that decrease the off-farm wage rate. The bivariate probit model described in (7) has four possible outcomes for the joint off-farm work decisions by the ith operator and the ith spouse, which, correspondingly, lead to four distinct probabilities (P jk for j, k = 0, 1) as in: and 2 (., .; ) is the bivariate normal cumulative density function of the model error terms (see Fabbri, Monfardini, and Radice, 2004). These probabilities, in turn, enter into the following log-likelihood function which has to be maximized: 10 where For both the 1996 and 1999 time periods, estimation of the parameters of the bivariate probit model in (9) was undertaken by means of maximum likelihood procedures, with corresponding standard errors being estimated based on the jackknife variance method (see Dubman). Under the delete-a-group jackknife approach, which is utilized to account for ARMS complex survey design, the original sample of surveyed farms representing all farms in the 48 contiguous states is divided by NASS into 15 nearly equal and mutually exclusive different subgroups. A resampling method with replacement is then conducted by NASS, which results in a set of 15 vectors of replicate weights. These vectors of replicate weights, in addition to the vector depicting the survey's full-sample weights (W ) are then used in 16 bivariate probit regressions. The first regression is based on W , which yields the full-sample estimate\u2424, and the remaining 15 regressions are based on the 15 vectors of \"replicate\" weights which, in turn, result in 15 vectors of\u2424 q (q = 1, . . . , 15). The final step involves the derivation of the jackknife variance-covariance matrix of regression coefficients as in the following: where S is a scalar representing the adjustment to the degrees of freedom for the jackknife procedure (here, S = 14/15), and\u02d9\u2424 is a (k + 1, q) matrix whose elements are the resultants of the difference of the kth parameter estimate based on the qth \"replicate\" weight and the corresponding kth parameter estimate based on the \"full-sample\" weight. The square roots of the elements of cov(\u2022) along the diagonal provide the appropriate standard errors to use in hypotheses testing when the data has the type of complex survey design structure as in ARMS. The definition of variables and their means are presented in table 2. Our sample sizes were 6,381 and 8,650 farm operators for 1996 and 1999, respectively. For 1999, we estimated two models. In the first model, 1999A, government payments entered the model as a sum of all types of payments, GOVT. In 1999B, government payments entered the model as the four separate categories of payments described above, PFCPYT, MLAPYT, MLPPYT, and CRPPYT. Some of the variables included in the econometric model were operator, spouse, or farm-specific, while others were regional effects, affecting either the reservation wage or the off-farm wage. Participation in off-farm work, OPOFFW and SPOFFW, was measured as the operator's and spouse's, respectively, participation in an off-farm wage or salary job. Individual characteristics include the human capital variables, C, of (5) such as age and education, and household size. Unfortunately, we are unable to include age and education of the spouse, since it was not collected on the ARMS in 1996 and 1999, but we include operator's age and education as reasonable proxies for these variables. Also included in the model was a measure of interest and dividend income of the household, the V of (4). The standard in off-farm participation models is to include a dummy variable for whether or not the operation specialized in dairy. Dairy operators are known to have lower off-farm participation rates due to the special labor requirements of that specialty. Labor requirements in dairy production remain high, despite the increased mechanization of dairy farms because of milking schedules. In this study, we included an expanded farm specialization dummy, recognizing that off-farm work may vary considerably by specialization more generally. The measure of profitability, net farm income (NFI), is expected to be negatively related to participation, since it provides an indication of the returns to allocating time to the farm rather than off the farm. Standard regional dummies were included in the model to account for regional differences, as in R of (5). We also included an indicator to reflect the general demand conditions for off-farm employment as to whether the household resided in a nonmetropolitan or metropolitan county. In addition, several variables were used to capture local labor market conditions. The local labor market area is defined as a group of counties based on the commuting zone, structured to capture local trading areas. The unemployment rate, lagged one year, was included to provide a measure of the supply of off-farm jobs. Also included was the percent of the labor market area living in an urbanized area. This variable provides an indicator of the accessibility of off-farm jobs. Finally, a set of variables was included that measured the percentage of local area employment in various industries. The availability of jobs that demand human capital characteristics that are relatively abundant in farm operators will affect their participation in off-farm work. Table 3 presents the results for the off-farm labor participation model. McFadden's R 2 is used to evaluate the fit of the model, and ranged from a reasonable 0.224 to 0.292. The error terms in operator's and spouse's equations are significantly and positively correlated, indicating a jointness in the decisions to work off the farm."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "In the 1999 models, all three human capital variables, OPAGE, OPAGESQ, and OPEDUC, were significant for both operator and spouse off-farm choice. Not all of the human capital variables were significant in the 1996 model. The variable OPAGESQ was significant in the 1996 model in explaining spouse's participation in off-farm work. OPE-DUC was significant in explaining off-farm participation for both the operator and the spouse in the 1996 model.

These expected relationships have been consistently found in the empirical literature (e.g., Huffman, 1980). HHSIZE was not significant in explaining the likelihood that an operator would work off the farm, but was a significant factor affecting spouse off-farm work in the 1996 and 1999 models. HHSIZE decreased the likelihood that spouses would work off the farm as expected, because of the increased value of at-home time. Off-farm interest and dividend income, OFFINT, was not significant for operators or spouses in the 1996 and 1999 models. The expected sign of this coefficient was negative, indicating that as nonlabor income increases, off-farm labor participation is expected to decrease. In contrast to the human capital variables, significance of this variable in the empirical literature varies by the sample population. NFI was significant and negative for both operators and spouses in the 1996 and 1999 models. The negative sign of NFI indicates that as NFI increases, the likelihood of operators working off the farm decreases. Among the dummy variables for farm specialization, DAIRY, was significant and negative in explaining the operator off-farm participation choice in the 1996 and 1999 models. This is consistent with many other studies, such as Lass, Findeis, and Hallberg (1989) and Gould and Saupe (1989). The other farm specialization dummies-CASHGR, OTHCROP, BEEFHOG, and OLVSTK-were significant in explaining operators' off-farm participation in either the 1996 or the 1999 models. However, farm specialization was much less important in the decision of the spouse to work off the farm. Only DAIRY in 1999 was significant in explaining spouses' off-farm participation. None of the regional dummies were statistically significant in the 1996 and 1999 models. Similarly, we found that the local area variables were relatively unimportant in explaining the participation likelihood. In the 1999A and 1999B models, none of the local labor market variables were significant and in the 1996 model, CONST and TRADE were significant in explaining the operator off-farm participation choice, and NMETRO was significant in explaining the spouse off-farm participation choice. Given the variability provided with a national sample, we expected these variables to provide more explanatory power. However, our results are similar to the results of other national studies (e.g., El-Osta and Ahearn, 1996;Huffman and El-Osta, 1997). The results for local area characteristics can only be described as curious results, indicating a need for further investigation. The variables of special interest in this study are those measuring government transfer payments. GOVT, PFCPYT, MLPPYT, CRPPYT, and MLAPYT were all significant for operator off-farm labor participation in all models, with the exception of the variable measuring CRP payments. Moreover, the payment coefficients were all negative, indicating that as payments increased, the likelihood of the operator working off the farm declined. This is true even when controlling for the NFI, which not only gives a good indication of profitability but gives some indication of farm size. For spouses, the relationship between payments and the likelihood of working off the farm was less clear-cut. In 1996, payments were not statistically significant. In 1999A, all payments combined were significant and negative, just as for operators. In the 1999B model, where payments entered the model individually, only PFCPYT and CRPPYT were statistically significant. Again, the signs were negative, indicating that as payments increased, the likelihood that the spouse worked off the farm declined. Since payments were not significant in the 1996 model in explaining the off-farm participation of spouses, we focus the rest of our discussion of the empirical results on the issue of how payments affect the off-farm participation of farm operators. The adverse impact of total payments (GOVT) on the likelihood of an operator working off farm was stronger in 1996 than in 1999. 11 Figure 1 shows this result graphically. We also provide a 95% confidence interval around the predicted probabilities of off-farm work. 12 Figure 2 shows a similar result, but for four different types of commodity specialization: cash grains, other crops, dairy, and beef and hogs. The same conclusion about differences in the two years is reached for each specialty, except for dairy. Recall that relatively few operators of dairies even work off the farm, and there is not a clear difference in the effects of payments on their off-farm participation between the two years. Was this differing impact of 1996 and 1999 payments on off-farm participation a result of the introduction of PFC payments in 1996? That is, did the new PFC payments introduced in 1996 have a differing impact on allocations of time to farm, off farm, and leisure activities with an adjustment delay until sometime after 1996? Or, was this change the result of the large increase in other payments in 1999, such as loan deficiency and emergency payments? Although the average 1999 PFC payments were very similar in level to the 1996 PFC levels, the total payments were more than double in 1999. We estimated an additional model, 1999B, to identify the effects of PFC payments and other payments separately. These results are reported in the last two columns of table 3. The impacts of the PFC payments, PFCPYT, on the likelihood of participating in off-farm employment, were very similar to the effects of the other payments, MLPPYT and MLAPYT. Figure 3 provides a plot of the predicted probabilities of off-farm work by the farm operator as a function of the three categories of payments defined for 1999. Findings indicate that there was no significant difference in the effect of payment types in 1999. Hence, we conclude that the differences we observe between 1996 and 1999 were the result of the greater magnitudes in total payments rather than the inclusion of PFC payments in the policy mix. This is supported by the relatively small effect of payments on off-farm participation relative to other variables in the model, such as age, education, and the spouse working off the farm. Payments have a negative effect on off-farm participation, but that effect is small and likely "}, {"section_title": "Implications", "text": "In this study, estimated regression coefficients in the participation equation indicated that payments had a different impact on off-farm labor participation of operators between 1996 and 1999. We investigated whether this difference was the result of the payment mix, coupled and decoupled payments, by examining the effects separately for the PFC payments and the other payments (marketing loss assistance payments and loan deficiency payments). We did not find a difference in the impact of the various programs in 1999 for the decision to participate off the farm. The differing impact between the two years is likely the result of the significantly greater transfer in 1999. It is interesting to consider why the different payments did not have differing impacts on the off-farm participation of the operator. After all, total payments in 1999 were at record-breaking levels at the time (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, 2004b). The average payment in 1996 represented 37% of the participating household's cash farm income, and then payments to the sector more than doubled in 1999. Of course, there is a complex array of factors at play, but part of the answer likely lies in our ability to measure the returns from farming. Farm households receive a variety of returns from their farming, only a portion of which are traditionally measured as cash returns. Many of the noncash returns are not easy to quantify and have not been quantified in our estimation. These noncash returns include unrealized capital gains and the \"nonpecuniary\" returns from living a farming lifestyle. Tax advantages, while cash in nature, have been unaccounted for in our models. These unaccounted-for farm returns mean that payments are a smaller share of the total farm returns than is captured by traditional measures of farm cash returns, and can dampen any expected effect of payments on off-farm participation. In fact, for those participating farm households that also earn off-farm income, they allocate nearly half of the operator and spouse time to farming, but receive less than 20% of the household cash income from farming. In other words, for a variety of reasons, labor participation may not be as sensitive to changing government program terms as policy designers would suppose and our standard economic accounting can detect."}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusions", "text": "Previous research has shown that government payments have a negative effect on off-farm work participation of operators and a positive effect on farm hours worked. Recent research has also shown that the policy shift to more decoupled payments that occurred with the passage of the 1996 FAIR did not have a differing impact on farm hours worked than did the traditional coupled payments. This result is consistent with the trends in the average hours participating farmers reported they worked on their farms, which showed little variation during the 1990s. In contrast to farm labor, simple descriptive statistics of off-farm work participation for farm operators who received government payments have not been stable during the 1990s. In particular, the off-farm labor participation rate increased following the passage of the 1996 FAIR. The contribution of this study was to provide evidence that the observed increase in off-farm participation of farm operators who received payments was not the result of the 1996 policy change. Government payments, whether coupled or decoupled, have a negative effect on off-farm labor participation of operators. The increase in the off-farm work of farmers who receive payments seems to underscore the continuation of the long-term trend toward greater reliance on off-farm work of farm households. Given the reliance of farm households on offfarm sources of income, consideration should be given to the effects of farm policies on offfarm work allocation in the design of agricultural policies.
