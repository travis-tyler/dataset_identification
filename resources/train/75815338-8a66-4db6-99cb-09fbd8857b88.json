Introduction", "text": "A major problem in the cross-subject analysis of brain images is morphological variability. Spatial normalization is a geometric transformation of images which minimizes shape variability, thereby improving the accuracy of the analysis of superimposed images from di erent individuals. For this reason, spatial normalization is particularly important in two areas: functional image analysis in stereotactic spaces and image guided neurosurgery. This paper describes a new spatial normalization technique, based on deformable models.\nSeveral methodologies for spatial normalization have been proposed in the literature. Among the most important ones are the ones reported in 1]{ 8]. In this paper we propose a new approach to the problem of spatial normalization, based on deformable models. In our approach, we use a deformable surface algorithm to obtain a mathematical representation of the outer cortical surface. Based on this representation, geometric features of the cortical surface, such as various curvatures, can be determined and used for the identi cation and matching of sulci, gyri, ssures, and other distinct cortical characteristics. In the proposed methodology we use the mathematical representation of the outer cortex to establish a one-to-one map between the three-dimensional images of two individuals.

Overview", "text": "The spatial normalization methodology described in this section uses an elastic warping transformation that brings two 3D images into register. Our transformation is driven by an external force eld de ned on a number of distinct anatomical surfaces, which can be either open or closed. In this paper we will use two such surfaces: the outer cortical boundary and the ventricular boundary. Each of these surfaces in one of two images to be registered is warped toward its con guration in the other image. This surface deformation then drives a full three-dimensional elastic warping of the rest of the image.\nIn Section II.B we focus on the outer cortical surface. In order to de ne the external forces that deform the outer cortical surface in one image to that in another, we rst establish a map between the outer cortex in the two images. We do this by rst nding a mathematical representation of the outer cortex using a deformable surface algorithm. Based on this representation we then nd the deformation that brings two outer cortical surfaces into registration. We decompose this deformation into two components. The rst is a homothetic map consisting of a uniform stretching or shrinking followed by an arbitrary bending; this component accounts for overall shape di erences and brings the outer cortex in gross correspondence across subjects. The second component is a nonuniform stretching or shrinking, which does not alter the overall outer cortical shape; this component accounts for inter-subject variability of the cortical sulci and gyri."}, {"section_title": "II.B. Outer Cortical Mapping", "text": "Our deformable surface algorithm, which nds a map between the outer cortical surfaces in two images, is described below. A more detailed description of the algorithm can be found in 9]."}, {"section_title": "II.B.1. Deformable Surface Algorithm", "text": "A deformable surface is an elastic surface which deforms under the in uence of external and internal elastic forces 10, 11, 12] . The external forces are designed to deform the surface toward some desired con guration, while the internal forces maintain its connectivity. The deformable surface is initially placed close to a structure of interest, and subsequently adapts to the shape of the structure after a series of deformations. Throughout our development we will assume that the tomographic images have been preprocessed. Resulting from this preprocessing is a mass function m(x) 2 0; 1], which is de ned in the three dimensional image V. The mass function has high value on the boundary of a structure of interest, enabling it to attract the deformable surface. Often, determining the mass function can be a complex problem by itself. Although there are several automated segmentation techniques which can be used for this purpose 13, 14] , manual interaction is often required because of the convoluted nature of several brain structures, and in particular of the cortex. In the experiments in this paper we use a binary mass function, which is determined via a supervised thresholdbased seeded region growing. The region growing is initialized in the interior of a structure of interest (e.g. parenchyma, ventricles, etc.) and terminates on the boundary of the structure where the mass m( ) is set equal to unity.\nHaving described the mass function, we now turn our attention to the deformable surface. It is a closed surface, denoted x(u; v) = (x(u; v); y(u; v); z(u; v)), where as customary in the di erential geometry literature 15] the variables u and v are de ned on a planar domain. The deformable surface behaves like an elastic balloon deforming under the in uence of an external force eld comprised of two components. The rst component is active when the deformable surface is in the vicinity of the outer cortex, and it tends to deform x(u; v) toward the outer cortex (see Fig. 1 ). Speci cally, it is an attractive force originating from the outer cortical mass, and is given by F(x) = c(x) ? x ; (1) where c(x) is the center of the mass m( ) included in a spherical neighborhood N(x) centered on a point x of the deformable surface (see Fig. 1 ).\nThe second component of the external force eld is exerted when F( ) is inactive, i.e. when the spherical neighborhood N(x) around a point on the deformable surface does not intersect the outer cortex. This force is equal to (u; v)N(u; v), where N(u; v) is the inward normal of the surface and (u; v) is unity when the neighborhood N(x(u; v)) does not intersect any outer cortical mass, and zero elsewhere. Under the in uence of this force, the deformable surface shrinks until it reaches the vicinity of the outer cortex.\nAfter a sequence of deformations the deformable surface converges to an equilibrium con guration satisfying the following di erential equations:\nHere, (u; v) and (u; v) determine the relative weight between the elastic forces, the inward normal force, and the external center of mass force. This equation expresses a force balance condition in which the total sum of the internal forces (top terms in (2)) and the external forces (bottom terms in (2)) acting on each point on the deformable surface is zero. Equations (2) are discretized and solved iteratively using successive overrelaxation (SOR). The computational requirements are considerably reduced by using a multi-resolution approach with three di erent sampling densities of the deformable surface. The solution, x(u; v), is a parametric description of the outer cortical surface and will be used in the following sections."}, {"section_title": "II.B.2. Overall Shape Matching", "text": "Consider two images to be registered, referred to as V 1 and V 2 . By applying the deformable surface algorithm to each image separately we obtain a parame-terization of the outer cortex in the two images, denoted x 1 (u; v) and x 2 (u; v), respectively. Based on this mathematical representation we next determine a deformation of the outer cortical surface in V 1 which brings it into correspondence with its homologous in V 2 . We decompose this deformation in two components: the rst is described in this section and the second is described in Section II.B.3. The rst component is a nearly homothetic map between the two outer cortical surfaces. This map consists of a uniform stretching or shrinking of the outer cortex in V 1 followed by an arbitrary bending which changes its overall shape. This component matches the overall shape of the brains in V 1 and V 2 , but it does not match individual features such as sulci and gyri.\nA 2D analog of a homothetic deformation is shown in Fig. 2 . In this example, a uniform stretching followed by an arbitrary bending was applied to the left curve in Fig. 2 and deformed it to the right curve in Fig. 2 . If a number of points, p 1 , p 2 ; : : : ; p N , are evenly spaced along the left curve in Fig. 2 , and an equal number of points, q 1 , q 2 ; : : : ; q N , are evenly spaced along the right curve in Fig. 2 , then a map corresponding p i ; i = 1; : : : ; N, to q i ; i = 1; : : : ; N, is a homothetic map between the two curves. Analogously in 3D, if a regular grid 1 , p ij ; i; j = 1; : : : ; N, is placed on one surface and a regular grid, q ij ; i; j = 1; : : : ; N, is placed on a second surface, then the map that corresponds p i;j to q ij is a homothetic map between the two surfaces (see, for example, Fig. 5 ).\nThe motivation behind seeking a homothetic map between the outer cortex in two brain images is that, although di erent brains have di erent shapes, their underlying structure is very similar, i.e. the relative positions of sulci and gyri with respect to each other is fairly consistent. For example, in Fig. 2 the two curves, which can be viewed as hypothetical cortical folds, have a very similar structure, although the orientations of their folds di er. Therefore, the homothetic map brings homologous regions in the two curves in register.\nThe surfaces x 1 (u; v) and x 2 (u; v) obtained through the deformable surface algorithm do not, in general, satisfy the homotheticity property. In particular, their points are not necessarily evenly spaced and their horizontal curves (v is xed) and vertical curves (u is xed) do not necessarily intersect at right angles. In order to obtain a homothetic map between them, we reparameterize them to satisfy the homotheticity property. This procedure is based on a xedpoint algorithm, an iterative procedure which redistributes the points along the horizontal curves and the vertical curves, resulting in evenly spaced points, and thereby satisfying the rst property of homotheticity. This step is done by traversing each curve individually and repositioning its points so that they are evenly spaced along each curve. At each iteration we also reorient the tangent vectors to the horizontal and vertical curves to form a right angle, thereby satisfying the second property of homotheticity. Typically, 6-9 iterations are su cient to yield a surface with evenly spaced points and with horizontal and vertical curves intersecting at right angles. The resulting map, which corresponds x 1 (u; v) on the rst cortical surface to the point x 2 (u; v) on the second, is a homothetic map between the two outer cortical surfaces.\nIn the experiments in Section III.A we demonstrate that homothetic mapping eliminates the overall di erences in the shape of the brain, and brings images from di erent subjects into a gross anatomical correspondence. It should be noted, however, that it does not account for inter-subject variability in the relative position of individual cortical folds. In order to account for this variability, in the following section we describe a procedure which re nes the homothetic map, by matching individual sulci."}, {"section_title": "II.B.3. Curvature matching", "text": "In order to match individual cortical features between the outer cortex in V 1 and the outer cortex in V 2 , we use one of the two principal curvatures 15], the maximum curvature, of the surfaces x 1 (u; v) and x 2 (u; v). The maximum curvature has high value at major cortical sulci and ssures, and low everywhere else, and it can be used for the identi cation and matching of features such as the central sulcus, the interhemispherical ssure, the Sylvian ssure, and others, as described in this section.\nConsider the mathematical representations, x 1 (u; v) and x 2 (u; v), of two outer cortical surfaces, having maximum curvature functions 1 (u; v) and 2 (u; v), respectively. The methodology described in this section nds a reparameterization 15] of one of the surfaces which brings its curvature pattern in better agreement with the second surface. This reparameterization does not change the shape of the surface. However, it applies a nonuniform stretching or shrinking which brings the cortical folds in better correspondence. The steps involved in the reparameterization of the deformable surface are shown schematically in Fig. 3 and are described below.\nWe rst obtain a attened representation (two-dimensional image) of the outer cortex with its maximum curvature superimposed. The location and shape of the sulci are easily identi ed on this 2D cortical map since the maximum curvature has high value (see, for example, Fig. 8 ). Based on the curvature map we then manually outline major sulci and ssures, through a user interface. Subsequently, these outlines are parameterized by arclength 15]. E ectively, this procedure places a large number of evenly spaced points along the outlined sulci in both V 1 and V 2 . In the experiments herein we have outlined the interhemispherical ssure and the central sulcus, which can be reliably identi ed based on the curvature maps. However, our method allows for an arbitrary number of open or closed curves to be outlined.\nWe subsequently apply a 2D elastic warping of the outer cortical map in one of the images bringing it into correspondence with the map of the second image 2 . Finally, the outer cortex is folded back to its original shape in both images. This procedure e ectively allows the outlined sulci to slide along the outer cortex until they are brought into coincidence. This, in turn, yields a nonuniform elastic stretching and shrinking of the outer cortex. We note that the overall cortical shape is preserved during this operation, since the curvature-based elastic deformation is applied to the attened cortex, which is then folded back to its original shape. In terms of the di erential geometric properties of the outer cortex, its extrinsic geometry (i.e. the overall shape) remains unchanged while its intrinsic geometry (the location of the sulci along the surface) is modi ed to bring the cortical folding pattern in better correspondence."}, {"section_title": "II.C. 3D Elastic Warping", "text": "The procedures described in Section II.B result in an explicit map from the outer cortex in V 1 to the outer cortex in V 2 . In the nal stage of our spatial normalization procedure we use this map to derive a full 3D normalization transformation. Speci cally, we rst deform the outer cortex in V 1 to its corresponding con guration in V 2 . We then let the remaining image warp, following the equations governing the deformation of an elastic body under an external force eld. The details of this transformation are described below.\nA spatial normalization transformation is a function U(x) which maps a point x in V 1 to a point U(x) in V 2 . Let q(x) be an indicator function being unity on the outer cortex in V 1 and zero everywhere else. Let, also, f(x) be the point on the outer cortex in V 2 to which a point x on the outer cortex in V 1 is mapped through the procedure of Section II.B. In our algorithm we obtain the transformation U( ) everywhere in V 1 by solving the equations governing the deformation of an elastic body, which are given below 18]:\nU(x) + ( + )rDivU(x) + q(x)(f(x) ? U(x)) + b(U(x)) = 0 ; (3) where r and denote the gradient and the Laplacian of a function, respectively. In (3), f(x)?x is the external force eld, which is applied to the cortical surface in V 1 and deforms it to its homologous in V 2 , and are elasticity constants, and b(U(x)) is an internal force eld which is described in detail below.\nThe force b( ) is de ned in the interior of the brain and its purpose is to bring internal brain structures in better alignment. In our current formulation, b( ) is applied to the ventricular boundaries, and it tends to align the ventricular boundaries of the warped V 1 image and the target image V 2 . The neighboring brain structures are rearranged accordingly by the elastic forces.\nSpeci cally, the force applied to a point x on the ventricular boundary in V 1 is equal to (see Fig. 4) b(U(x)) = c v (U(x)) ? U(x) ; (4) where c v (U(x)) is the center of the ventricular boundary mass in V 2 included in the neighborhood of the point U(x). The internal force b( ) vanishes when the two ventricular boundaries are coincident. The ventricular boundary mass is obtained using threshold-based seeded region growing initialized within the ventricles. The region growing procedure terminates on the ventricular boundaries which are assigned unit value.\nThe equations in (3) are discretized and solved iteratively using the successive overrelaxation numerical optimization technique 19], which is especially suited for large and sparse systems of equations. A multiresolution scheme is also employed to further speed up the convergence."}, {"section_title": "III.

In order to speed up the convergence of the algorithm, we only applied it in medium resolution, by sampling the deformable surface with 5,000 points. The deformable surface was initialized at an ellipsoidal con guration, which was automatically determined by the algorithm using the outermost points of the outer cortical boundaries. The computational time required for each 3D image was 6 seconds on a Silicon Graphics workstation.\nWe then applied the elastic warping transformation described in Section II.C and warped the MR image to the atlas. In order to speed up the convergence, the equations in (3) were solved in medium resolution by evaluating the function U( ) only on a subset of the points in V 1 (a subsampling factor of 2 was used in each dimension).

In this gure, the outer cortex is viewed from above. The top of the images correspond to the anterior of the brain and the bottom to the posterior.

Ventricular Enlargement", "text": "In our nal experiment we tested the performance of our technique on datasets from individuals with substantial ventricular enlargement, which is often encountered in elderly populations. In this experiment, we selected two MR SPGR datasets, one from an individual with considerable ventricular expansion, and we applied the deformable surface algorithm obtaining a map from the outer cortex of the individual with smaller ventricular enlargement to the one with large ventricular enlargement (target dataset). We then applied the elastic warping procedure using both the outer cortical map and the internal ventricular force b( ) and obtained the result shown in Fig. 9 superimposed on the outlines of the target image. Note the good correspondence in the ventricular region and the surrounding structures obtained by the considerable ventricular enlargement applied by the algorithm.\nIn order to quantitatively test the performance of our algorithm in this experiment, we selected 20 cortical landmarks and 16 landmarks in the deep brain structures (periventricular region, thalamus, caudate, putamen, claus-trum). We de ned the registration error at each landmark to be the distance between its location in the warped image and its location in the target image. The average error for the deep structures was 2.4 mm with standard deviation 1.4 mm and maximum error 6 mm at the claustrum (this is in agreement with our expectation, since the elastic transformation is determined based on the cortical and the ventricular boundaries, none of which is very close to the claustrum). The average error for the cortical landmarks was 5.3 mm with standard deviation 4.1 mm and maximum error 14.6 mm. We observed that the most consistent across-individuals cortical areas, and particularly the pre-and post-central gyri and the insular cortex, had a very small error of the order of 2-3 mm. In contrast, regions like the cingulate sulcus and the parieto-occipital sulcus had large error. As it was expected, the error on the landmarks closer to the outer cortex was smaller than the error at deeper cortical landmarks."}, {"section_title": "IV. Discussion", "text": "We presented a new technique for spatial normalization of images. Our methodology is based on an outer cortical mapping between two images to be registered, which is used to drive a three-dimensional elastic warping of the images. An internal force applied to the ventricular boundaries brings the ventricles and the surrounding structures in better correspondence.\nWe tested our technique by registering MR images with MR and atlas images. In particular, we showed that homothetic mapping brings homologous outer cortical regions in good correspondence, thereby determining a large number of corresponding regions in a highly automated way. We obtained such a map by using a deformable surface algorithm, which yields a mathematical representation of the outer cortical surface, and a xed-point algorithm. We used the correspondences determined by homothetic mapping to elastically warp images into register with each other.\nDespite the overall good registration obtained using homothetic mapping, there is still a considerable localization error, which is largely due to anatomical variability in individual brain features. Speci cally, although homothetic mapping accounts for an arbitrary bending of the brain boundary, it allows only a uniform expansion or contraction of the outer cortical surface. Equivalently, it accounts for any overall shape di erences of the brain but it assumes that an observer sitting on the outer cortical surface sees the same cortical folding pattern in all individuals. This assumption is the main limitation of homothetic mapping, given the inter-subject variability of the cortical folding pattern.\nTo overcome this limitation we developed a procedure which re nes the homothetic map, and allows a non-uniform stretching or shrinking of the outer cortical surface by matching features identi ed through the curvature maps. In this paper we used two features: the central sulcus and the inter-hemispherical ssure. By using the resulting map in our 3D elastic warping, we demonstrated a considerable improvement in the registration accuracy in the neighborhood of the features used. More notable was the improvement in the registration around the central sulcus. The non-uniform mapping allowed the central sulcus and the neighboring sulci and gyri to slide along the outer cortical surface and match their counterparts in the target image. We should note that the improvement obtained through curvature matching is at the expense of both an additional computational load and the requirement for human interaction in outlining sulci and ssures. For several applications the registration accuracy obtained using only the homothetic mapping is adequate, as the experiments in Sections III.B and III.D showed, and the additional step of curvature-based warping can be omitted.\nIn our experiments we also tested the performance of our spatial normalization technique on pathological cases, obtaining a good registration around the ventricles through an elastic stretching of the ventricular boundaries. An accurate registration in the peri-ventricular region of the brain, and especially in the thalamic region, is of great importance in computer-aided neurosurgery. It is also important in the analysis of data from elderly populations 20, 21, 22] , which often have substantial ventricular enlargement.\nRelation to other methods. Our approach has common characteristics with the methods proposed in 3, 5] . In particular, all methodologies use an elastic warping transformation to spatially normalize images. However, there are three fundamental di erences, which are described below.\n1. Methodological issues. Our technique nds a mathematical description of the outer cortical surface, which can be readily expanded to incorporate other distinct anatomical boundaries. Based on this mathematical representation, geometric properties, such as curvatures, torsions, etc., can be calculated and can be used for feature identi cation and matching. This is in contrast to methodologies based on image cross-correlation which do not extract anatomical features from the images, but derive the optimal normalization transformation using a maximum overlap criterion.\n2. Computational e ciency. The computational requirements of our approach are 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than those in the methodologies based on image cross-correlation. This is because outer cortical map, which determines the external forces in our methodology, is established prior to the elastic warping, through the deformable surface algorithm. In contrast, the external forces in 3, 5, 6 ] are recalculated at each iteration during the deformation of the image, which considerably increases the computational load.\n3. Modality independence. Since the proposed method uses only the boundaries of anatomical structures, it is modality independent. In contrast, methods relying on image intensity cross-correlation require either the same modality, or an explicit map from the modality of one of the images to that of the other.\nExtensions. Several extensions of our basic technique are possible. In particular, in this paper we focused on the alignment of the outer cortical and the ventricular boundaries. In addition to these surfaces, internal cortical features, such as the sulcal surfaces between juxtaposed cortical folds, can be used for matching of the deep parts of the cortex. Current research in our laboratory in that direction focuses on the modeling the deep sulcal surfaces as ribbons, which can be matched based on their di erential geometric properties, and will be reported in a separate paper. Extensions to our curvature-based feature matching is also possible. Besides the two features matched in the experiments in this paper, the central sulcus and the interhemispherical ssure, other features can be readily incorporated into our formulation as well. In particular, as it is described in detail in 9], several cortical features, including the pre-and post-central sulcus, the superior frontal sulcus, the tips of the temporal lobes, the occipital poles, and others, can be identi ed through the maximum, the minimum, and the Gaussian curvature maps, and matched. The development of an automatic feature identi cation and matching technique, assisted by prior knowledge provided by a brain template, is a main focus of our current and future research.\nV. Acknowledgements surface Figure 1 . The deformation of the deformable surface toward the outer cortex is driven by two forces. The rst force, F( ), is active when outer cortical mass is present in the vicinity of the deformable surface (e.g. point x) and attracts it toward the outer cortex. The second force, N( ), is active when no cortical mass is present in the vicinity of the deformable surface (e.g. point y), and has direction along the inward normal of the deformable surface. "}]
