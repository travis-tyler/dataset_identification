The following critical parameters were set during target prediction to identify physiologically relevant SARS-CoV-2 targeting miRNAs. The minimum free energy (MFE) was fixed at -25kcal/mol to ensure that the binding of miRNA to target mRNA can supersede the local secondary structures (Kertesz et al., 2007; M\u00fcckstein et al., 2006) . In animal miRNAs, seed sequence complementarity is a major determinant for efficient miRNA binding to target mRNA.

Since non-canonical G-U base pairing is well tolerated in miRNA mediated target mRNA suppression in animal miRNAs, this was allowed (Saxena et al., 2003) . The maximum internal bulge and bulge loop length were restricted between 0-2 bases to ensure specific binding and to avoid false positives. Conservation of miRNA binding site across homologous species is a parameter used to assess the specificity of miRNA target interaction.\nHowever, RNA hybrid does not allow the evaluation of binding site conservation within different viral genomes. Hence, to ensure the specificity of miRNA binding to SARS-CoV-2 genome, we aligned the miRNA binding site sequence within the SARS-CoV-2 genome (MT050493.1) with global isolates of SARS-CoV-2 as well as with SARS-CoV sequence using MEGA software, version 10.1 (Stecher et al., 2020) .

This is achieved by a sequence and structure dependent ribosomal slippage event which occurs during the translation of ORF1ab mRNA. This phenomenon in coronaviruses requires two cis RNA elements, namely, a slippery sequence (UUUAAAC, 13442 to 13448 nt in SARS-CoV-2) and a hairpin type pseudoknot structure located at the downstream sequence (Baranov et al., 2005) . It has been proposed, that pausing of ribosomes in this hairpin pseudoknot allows ribosomal slippage by one base at the -1 direction leading to the in-frame translation of ORF1b. Disruption of ribosomal slippage event at this site will lead to the premature termination of translation at the stop codon located within the hairpin pseudoknot, thereby inhibiting the synthesis of ORF1b. Interestingly, cme-miR-530b and osa-miR-530-5p both of which share similar mature miRNA sequence was found to target ribosomal slippage region between two overlapping ORFs, ORF1a and b ( Figure 3A) . The osa/cme-miR-530-5p binding region overlaps with the pseudoknot structure encompassing the stop codon (13448 to 13469). The MFE of miR-530-5p binding far exceeds the MFE of the pseudoknot structure (-27 vs -18 kcal/mol). Hence, we posit that even in the absence of a canonical miRNA mediated suppression, this unwinding of pseudoknot by miR-530-5p may indirectly inhibit the synthesis of ORF1b by not allowing ribosomal slippage and thus preventing the replication of SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 3A ).\nMiRNAs have also been found in grape-derived ENPs in high abundance and whether these miRNAs target human genes, is yet to be validated (Ju et al., 2013) .\nIn this study, we further extend the possibility of exploiting the cross-kingdom regulation by miRNAs to treat the current COVID-19 pandemic. In this line, we identified ENP-derived miRNAs that could potentially target SARS-CoV-2 genes. So far, ENPs have been isolated and characterized from several edible plants and fruits (Ju et al., 2013; Xiao et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2016b) . We first mined these datasets to identify miRNAs that are present in high abundance in ENPs. Next, using a target prediction pipeline with stringent selection criteria, we identified 22 miRNAs that bind to SARS-CoV-2 and 12 of these miRNA candidates do not bind to SARS-CoV, a close relative of SARS-CoV-2 which caused the SARS outbreak in 2003. Further, we have also independently verified the presence of six miRNAs in ginger and grapefruit ENPs.\nTo our knowledge, this the first study which has systematically evaluated the possibility of using plant ENP-derived miRNAs to target viral genome. Plant miRNAs targeting influenza genome has been reported earlier for miR-2911, a miRNA highly expressed in honeysuckle (HS) plant. When mice were administered orally with HS decoction, high levels of miR-2911 was detected in serum and this could suppress influenza virus (H5N1) infection in vitro and in vivo (Zhou et al., 2015) . The same authors recently showed SARS-CoV-2 targeting potential of HS derived miR-2911. SARS-CoV-2 possessed twenty eight miR-2911 binding sites within its genome and the specific binding of miR-2911 mimics with SARS-CoV-2 target sites were validated in vitro with chimeric luciferase assays. Exosome encapsulated with miR-2911 mimics, was able to suppress SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in vitro. Further, administration of HS decoction to human volunteers led to a favourable reduction in time taken to become SARS-CoV-2 negative (Zhou et al., 2020) . However, in both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 studies, encapsulation of miR-2911 in vesicles, is an essential process for J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof systemic delivery of miR-2911. Interestingly, miR-2911 appears to be intrinsically resistant to nucleases and also have a natural tendency to associate itself within exosomes after absorption in GI tract. However, it is not clear if all plant-derived miRNAs from the diet exhibit nuclease resistant and are encapsulated in serum exosomes. Hence, plant miRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 may require additional encapsulation in liposomal or nano formulations for intracellular delivery (Lee et al., 2019) . The innate ability of ENPs to fuse with any type of mammalian cells obviates the need for separate miRNA delivery methods to target COVID-19 . Further, ENPs derived from different host plants appears to have preferential target tissue which is likely attributed to their lipid composition (Yang et al., 2018) . It has been shown earlier that intranasal/venous delivery of grapefruit derived ENPs, was detected in murine lung tissue up to 72 hr. post-delivery, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 targeting ENP miRNAs could be delivered safely via the intranasal/venous route for tissues affected in COVID-19. However, further experimental research supporting spontaneous uptake of ENPs in lung epithelial cells in vivo, direct binding of ENP derived miRNAs to SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and suppression of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in vivo are warranted in future. Alternatively, candidate miRNAs which efficiently suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication can be overexpressed in edible plants by transgenic approach and ENPs isolated from the transgenic plants can be used for COVID-19 therapy (Yang et al., 2017) .\nFor the successful therapeutic application of ENPs/ENP derived miRNAs, large scale compatible purification methods are essential. We have recently demonstrated a costeffective and scalable purification method to purify ginger ENPs using PEG-6000 (Kalarikkal et al., 2020) . Ginger ENPs purified by this method was structurally and functionally similar to ENPs purified by the gold standard differential ultracentrifugation method which requires expensive instrumental set up and lack scalability. The PEG method developed was J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f advantageous in multiple aspects. Firstly, food-grade PEG is cheaper (<4USD per Kg), it is generally regarded as safe (GRAS) material and it is also employed as a food additive (Panel et al., 2018) . Hence, we speculate that exploiting ENP-derived miRNAs as a therapeutic modality against COVID-19 infection offers a safer, target-specific and cheaper solution.\nThus, it is evident from our study that ENP derived miRNAs may be developed as a nontoxic therapeutic modality against COVID-19. However, further validation of ENP derived miRNAs binding to target mRNA (SARS-CoV-2 genome/transcriptome) could not be performed due to the requirement of advanced biosafety level -3 laboratories to handle virus cultures."}, {"section_title": "Plant ENPs contain multiple miRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2:", "text": "To extrapolate our results for COVID-19 treatment, we plotted the relative abundance of the SARS-CoV-2 targeting miRNAs as a heatmap in 11 edible plant ENPs, using the raw read counts obtained from Xiao et al., (2018) .

Gma-miR-166m which targets ORF8 in SARS-CoV-2 belongs to a highly conserved miR-166 family of miRNAs with 21 sub-members encoded within . This could be due to the technical variation during library preparation, sequencing platform or the variety of ginger used for ENP isolation. It is also worth noting that, aly-miR-166a-3p, which share identical sequence with gma-miR-166m with an additional U at the 5' end was also found to be highly enriched in ginger ENPs (Supplementary file 1) ."}, {"section_title": "Target specificity of ENP-derived miRNAs to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV:", "text": "To investigate the specificity of the selected miRNAs against SARS-CoV-2, we aligned the miRNA target sequences identified using the template strain (MT050493.1) with sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from other countries such as USA, Nepal, France, Italy and China (Wuhan isolate) and SARS-CoV. It has been observed that global strains of SARS-CoV-2 share 99% sequence similarity with the original Wuhan isolate (Sardar et al., 2020) . Due to this, all the 22 miRNA target sites were highly conserved across all isolates of SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 4) . Even though SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly homologous, six regions of differences (RD) has been identified earlier which are located within ORF1ab, S, ORF7b and ORF8 genes (Xu et al., 2020a) . Based on this, we segregated the miRNA target sites into 3 groups. Group I consisted of 12 miRNA target sites in which nucleotide mismatch/s were found between SARS-CoV-2 isolates and SARS-CoV in seed sequences ( Figure 4A) . Given that complete complementarity at the seed sequences is essential for miRNA mediated target suppression, miRNAs targeting these regions are expected to be specific against SARS-CoV-2 but may not bind to SARS-CoV (Witkos et al., 2011) . Group II consisted of 3 miRNA target sites which are conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV suggesting that these miRNAs can equally suppress both species of viruses ( Figure 4B) . On the other hand, 7 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof miRNA target sites had full conservation at the seed sequence with partial mismatches at the 5' end and these are classified as Group III ( Figure 4C) .
