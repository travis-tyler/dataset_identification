[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "This report presents selected findings about the financial aid received by postsecondary students during the 2003-04 academic year. It is based on survey data in the 2003-04 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:04). NPSAS:04 is based on data collected from a sample of about 80,000 undergraduates and 11,000 graduate and first-professional students who were enrolled at any time between July 1, 2003, andJune 30, 2004, in about 1,400 postsecondary institutions. The sample was limited to institutions in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico that were eligible to participate in the federal financial aid programs in Title IV of the Higher Education Act. The NPSAS:04 study sample represents about 19 million undergraduates and 3 million graduate and first-professional students. Because NPSAS:04 includes students enrolled at any time over a 12month period, it includes more students than were enrolled only in the 2003 fall term. Preliminary data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System indicate that about 15 million undergraduates and 2.5 million graduate and first-professional students were enrolled in the fall of 2003. NPSAS classifies financial aid by type (e.g., grants, loans, work-study, graduate assistantships, or some combination) and by the source of aid funds (e.g., federal, state, institutional, or employer). Financial aid includes any type of aid received from any source except parents, friends, or relatives. However, the aid estimates do not include federal tax credits for postsecondary education (Hope and Lifelong Learning) and do not include all types of borrowing for education (such as credit cards or home equity loans). The tables in this report show the percentage of students who received financial aid of a particular type or from a particular source, and the average amount that was received by those students who were awarded that category of aid. Students may receive more than one type of aid and aid from more than one source. comparing two numbers, and all differences cited are statistically significant at the .05 level. Additional information about public access to the data files with the DAS and the data sources used in the survey is presented in appendix B of this report. The following provides some general information about the financial aid data presented in the tables. More details about the particular variables used to produce the tables are available in the glossary (appendix A). The brief descriptions of the federal Title IV programs are based on the U.S. Department of Education's comprehensive 2003-04 Federal Student Aid Handbook, available at http://ifap.ed.gov/IFAPWebApp/currentSFAHandbooksPag.jsp."}, {"section_title": "Institution and Student Characteristics", "text": "Information about the type of institution attended only includes students who were enrolled at one institution. Students who attended more than one institution during the 2003-04 academic year are classified in a separate category because the institution at which they were sampled was not necessarily where they received their financial aid. The attendance pattern is important in understanding the distribution of financial aid because students who are enrolled part time or for only part of an academic year are not eligible to receive as much aid as students enrolled full time for a full academic year. Full-time/full-year attendance is defined as being enrolled full time for 9 or more months during the academic year (July 1, 2003, through June 30, 2004. Many financial aid programs are need-based, which means that eligibility is usually related to income level. A critical question in determining students' need for financial aid is whether the students are dependent or independent of their parents for financial support. For financial aid purposes, most undergraduates under the age of 24 are considered to be dependent on their parents. The exceptions are those under 24 who are married, have dependents of their own, are veterans, or are orphans or wards of the court. These exceptions, as well as graduate students and any students age 24 or older, are considered to be independent for financial aid purposes. For dependent students, financial aid need analysis takes into consideration the income of the dependent student's parents; for independent students, only the income of the student (and a spouse, if married) is considered. The tables show total income in 2002 because financial aid need analysis is based on income in the calendar year prior to the academic year ."}, {"section_title": "Types of Financial Aid", "text": "The three basic types of undergraduate financial aid are grants, student loans, and workstudy jobs. Grants include grants, scholarships, or tuition waivers from federal, state, institutional, or private sources, including employers. Grants may be awarded on the basis of need or merit, or both. Merit may be defined as academic success, athletic ability, artistic talents, or criteria established by institutions other than financial need. Student loans may be from any source, but federal Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) are excluded from the student loan totals. PLUS loans to parents are included in the \"other type of aid\" category, as are veterans' benefits and job training funds.

PLUS loans are available to the parents of dependent undergraduates and are not needbased. There is no fixed annual PLUS loan limit. Parents may borrow any amount that does not exceed the student's total price of attendance at the institution minus any other financial aid received. The federal Title IV campus-based program funds are allocated to institutions, and the financial aid officers at the institutions determine the allocation of awards to students within federal guidelines. Pell Grant recipients are given priority for FSEOG awards and Perkins loans."}, {"section_title": "Graduate and First-Professional Aid", "text": "Graduate students include any students who have earned a bachelor's degree and are enrolled in master's degree, doctoral degree, or postbaccalaureate certificate programs, or are taking advanced-level courses without being formally enrolled in a degree program. Firstprofessional students are enrolled in advanced degree programs in the fields of law, medicine and related fields, and theological professions (see appendix A for specific degree programs). The income levels shown are the income of the student and a spouse, if married. The major types of financial aid received by graduate and first-professional students are student loans, grants (including fellowships), and assistantships (including teaching, research, or any other graduate assistantships). Grant and fellowship funds may come from any source. The source of funds for graduate fellowships and assistantships is not usually specified in the data sources. Research assistantships and fellowships administered by the institutions may include funds from federal and other outside sources. Aid from employers is included in the grants category and is also shown separately. Employer aid consists of tuition reimbursements to students from employers, grants to students from their parents' employers, and tuition waivers from the institution for faculty or staff and their dependents. Although graduate students holding assistantships may be considered employees of the institution attended, tuition waivers for graduate assistants are not included in the employer aid category. Such tuition waivers are included in the total grants category, however."}, {"section_title": "Selected Findings 1", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Types of financial aid received by undergraduates in 2003-04 (tables 1 and 2):", "text": "\u2022 Sixty-three percent of all undergraduates enrolled in the 2003-04 academic year received some type of financial aid (grants, loans, work-study, or other).

Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study with a follow-up survey 2 years later (BPS:04/06), and then again in 2009. A section of the NPSAS student interview focuses on describing the experience of these students in their first year of postsecondary education. Also, for the first time, NPSAS:04 includes representative samples of undergraduate students for 12 states that explicitly expressed interest and support for such state-level data. into 58 institutional strata based on institutional control, highest level of offering, and Carnegie classification. NPSAS:04 also includes state-representative undergraduate student samples for three types of institutions (public 4-year, public 2-year, and private not-for-profit 4-year) in 12 states. 1 Interested readers are referred to the forthcoming NPSAS:04 Methodology Report for a more detailed description of the sample designs, including a complete listing of the 58 strata and further details. Institutions were selected using Chromy's sequential probability minimum replacement (pmr) sampling algorithm (Chromy 1979), which is similar to systematic sampling, to select institutions with probabilities proportional to a composite measure of size based on expected enrollment. Initially a sample of 1,633 institutions was selected in fall 2002 so that these institutions could be notified of their selection early and to allow a separate field test sample to be selected from the remaining institutions on the sampling frame. In summer 2003, an additional sample of 34 institutions was selected from a frame of institutions not included on the initial sampling frame. Of the total 1,667 sample institutions, 808 were selected with certainty. Of these 1,667 sample institutions, 1,633 were found to be NPSAS eligible institutions and 1,364 of these 1,633 institutions provided student enrollment lists for use as the second stage (i.e., student) sampling frame. Table B-1 shows the number of institutions sampled, the number of eligible institutions, and the count and unweighted and weighted percentages of institutions providing enrollment lists by institutional characteristics. The sampling frames for selecting sample students were paper and electronic lists of students provided by the sample institutions for those students enrolled in terms or courses of instruction during the previously defined NPSAS year. Student lists were sampled on a flow basis as they were received, using equal probability stratified systematic sampling. There were eight student sampling strata as follows: (1) in-state first-time beginner students; (2) out-of-state first-time beginner students; (3) in-state other undergraduate students; (4) out-of-state other undergraduate students; (5) master's students; (6) doctoral students; (7) other graduate students; and (8) first-professional students. 1 These 12 states were selected by NCES from those expressing interest. The 12 states were categorized into three groups based on population size: four small states (CT, DE, NE, OR), four medium-size states (GA, IN, MN, TN), and four large states (CA, IL, NY, TX). 2 Among the 34 ineligible institutions: 12 closed after the sampling frame was defined, 13 were treated as merged institutions because two or more campuses were included on one combined student list, and the remaining 9 failed to meet one or more of the criteria for institutional NPSAS eligibility. First-time beginner students (FTBs) were stratified separately from other undergraduate students because they were oversampled to allow for sufficient numbers to be surveyed in the 2006 follow-up study, the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:04/06). FTBs and other undergraduate students were each divided into in-state and out-of-state strata because undergraduate in-state students were oversampled in the 12 states with staterepresentative samples. These in-state and out-of-state strata were used for all institutions to allow for sampling ease and consistency; however, in states that did not have state-representative samples, in-state students were sampled at the same rate as out-of-state students. For each student stratum, the enrollment list was sampled at a rate designed to provide approximately equal student-level probabilities. Student sampling rates were revised after sufficient lists had been received to more accurately estimate the overall sample yield. Those sampling procedures resulted in the selection of 109,213 students. Upon the completion of data collection, 90,746 students out of the 101,013 sample members determined to be eligible for NPSAS, were determined to have sufficient key data to meet the definition of a respondent. A student respondent is defined as any sample member who is determined to be eligible for the study and, minimally, has valid data from any source for the following: \u2022 student type (undergraduate or graduate/first professional); \u2022 date of birth or age; \u2022 gender; and \u2022 at least 8 of the following 15 variables: \u2022 dependency status; \u2022 marital status; \u2022 any dependents; \u2022 income; \u2022 expected family contribution (EFC); \u2022 degree program; \u2022 class level; \u2022 first-time beginner (FTB) status; \u2022 months enrolled; \u2022 tuition; \u2022 received federal aid; \u2022 received non-federal aid; \u2022 student budget; \u2022 race; and \u2022 parent education.

The imputation procedures employed a two-step process. In the first step, the matching criteria and imputation classes that were used to stratify the dataset were identified such that all imputation was processed independently within each class. In the second step, the weighted sequential hot deck process was implemented, 2 whereby missing data were replaced with valid data from donor records that match the recipients with respect to the matching criteria. Variables requiring imputation were not imputed simultaneously. Basic demographic variables with full information were imputed first. Then, variables with increasing levels of missing data were imputed using previously imputed variables in the determination of optimal matching criteria. The order in which variables were imputed was also determined to some extent by the substantive nature of the variables. For example, basic demographics (such as age) were imputed first and these were used to process education variables (such as student level and enrollment intensity) which in turn were used to impute the financial aid variables (such as aid receipt and loan amounts). For variables with less than 5 percent missing data, the variables used for matching criteria were selected based on prior knowledge about the dataset and the known relationships between variables. For example, in almost all cases the student's age and enrollment intensity (fulltime/part-time status) were used as matching variables in the imputation process. For variables with more than 5 percent missing data, a process called Chi-Square Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID) was used to identify the matching criteria that are most closely related to the variable being imputed (Kass 1980). This step produced a number of imputation classes which contain sets of donors that were used to impute recipients belonging to that class. Next, the imputation classes were used as input to a SAS macro that implemented the weighted sequential hot deck procedure. Additionally, data were sorted within each imputation class to increase the chance of obtaining a close match between donor and recipient. The hot deck process is sequential in that the search for donors occurs sequentially, starting with the recipient and progressing up and down the sorted file to find the set of eligible donors from which a random selection of one was made. The process is weighted since it incorporates the sample weight of each record in the search and selection routine. 3 In some cases, further intervention was needed to ensure accuracy and consistency of imputation as determined by preexisting edit rules. For example, to impute the level of parents' education, when we know the parents have some college but not the parents' specific education level, the potential pool of donors was limited to those with at least some college education, to prevent imputing parents' education level as less than college."}, {"section_title": "Weighting", "text": "All estimates in this report are weighted to represent the target population described in the sample design section.

The level of effort required is guided by the magnitude of the nonresponse.\" Response rates are discussed below for institutions and students. When response rates were less than 85 percent, a nonresponse bias analysis was conducted. The bias in an estimated mean based on respondents, R y , is the difference between this mean and the target parameter, \u03c0, i.e., the mean that would be estimated if a complete census of the target population was conducted and everyone responded. This bias can be expressed as follows: The estimated mean based on nonrespondents, NR y , can be computed if data for the particular variable are available for most of the nonrespondents.

As shown in table B-1, 1,364 of the 1,633 eligible sample institutions were respondents (83.5 unweighted percent and 80.0 weighted percent). The institution weighted response rate is also below 85 percent for six of the nine types of institutions. The weighted response rates by type of institution range from 70.3 percent for public 4-year non-doctorate institutions to 92.6 percent for private not-for-profit less-than-4-year institutions. A nonresponse bias analysis was conducted for all institutions and for the six types of institutions with a weighted response rate below 85 percent. The nonresponse bias was estimated for variables known, i.e., non-missing, for most respondents and nonrespondents. There are extensive data available for all institutions from IPEDS, and the following variables were used: 5 \u2022 type of institution; 6 \u2022 Carnegie classification; \u2022 degree of urbanization; \u2022 OBE region; \u2022 Historically Black College or University indicator; \u2022 percent of students receiving federal grant aid; \u2022 percent of students receiving state/local grant aid; \u2022 percent of students receiving institutional grant aid; \u2022 percent of students receiving student loan aid; \u2022 percent of students enrolled: Hispanic; \u2022 percent of students enrolled: Asian or Pacific Islander; \u2022 percent of students enrolled: Black, non-Hispanic; \u2022 total undergraduate enrollment; \u2022 male undergraduate enrollment; 5 For the continuous variables, categories were formed based on quartiles or logical breaks. 6 Type of institution was only used in the nonresponse bias analysis for all institutions. \u2022 female undergraduate enrollment; \u2022 total graduate/first-professional enrollment; \u2022 male graduate/first-professional enrollment; and \u2022 female graduate/first-professional enrollment.

Second, nonresponse adjustments were computed, and the variables listed above were included in the nonresponse models. The nonresponse adjustments (see the weighting section of this appendix) were designed to significantly reduce or eliminate nonresponse bias for variables included in the models. Third, after the weights were computed, any remaining bias was estimated for the variables listed above and statistical tests were performed to check the remaining significant nonresponse bias.

For the other types of institutions, the percent of variable categories with significant bias decreased after weight adjustments. Significant bias was reduced for the variables known for most respondents and nonrespondents, which are considered to be some of the more analytically important variables and are correlated with many of the other variables.

These are minimal data requirements and the vast majority of study respondents were characterized by considerably more complete data. As shown in table B-2, of the 101,013 eligible sample students the unweighted response rate was 89.8 percent, and the weighted response rate was 91.0 percent. The student weighted response rate is also above 85 percent for all types of institutions with the exception of public 2year institutions. The weighted response rates by type of institution range from 83.9 percent for public 2-year institutions to 96.9 percent for private not-for-profit 4-year non-doctoral institutions. Therefore, a nonresponse bias analysis was conducted only for students from public 2-year institutions. The nonresponse bias was estimated for the seven variables known for both respondents and nonrespondents. Five of these variables were known for all sample members, and the remaining two variables were only known for federally aided students. These variables are included on the DAS and are listed below: For all sample members: \u2022 region; \u2022 institution total enrollment; \u2022 CPS match (yes/no); \u2022 Pell grant recipient (yes/no); and \u2022 Stafford loan recipient (yes/no). For federally aided students: \u2022 Pell grant amount; and \u2022 Stafford loan amount. Additionally, it was determined that percent part-time fall enrollment and in-state tuition are important variables to include in the nonresponse bias analysis for students in public 2-year institutions. These variables are not known for both respondents and nonrespondents; however, institution-level data available from IPEDS were used to conduct the analyses. The steps listed above for institution nonresponse bias analysis are also applicable for the student nonresponse bias analysis. That is, the nonresponse bias was estimated for the above variables, tested (adjusting for multiple comparisons) to determine if the bias is significant at the 5 percent level, and nonresponse adjustments were computed including the above variables in the nonresponse models. Any remaining bias was estimated for these variables and statistical tests were performed to check the remaining significant nonresponse bias.

Significant bias was reduced somewhat for the variables known for most respondents and nonrespondents, which are considered to be some of the more analytically important variables and are correlated with many of the other variables. However, significant bias still remains because there were small numbers of nonrespondents in this type of institution applying for and receiving federal aid. This may be due to the definition of a respondent. All significant bias was eliminated for the non-aid variables, i.e. region, institution total enrollment, percent part-time fall enrollment, and in-state tuition.

Base weights must be used in such analysis. Comparison items should have very high response rates. This approach may be limited to the extent that items available for respondents and nonrespondents may not be related to the low response rate item being analyzed.\" Moreover, NCES Statistical Standard 1-3-5 states that: \"Item response rates (RRI) are calculated as the ratio of the number of respondents for whom an in-scope response was obtained (I x for item x) to the number of respondents who are asked to answer that item. The number asked to answer an item is the number of unit level respondents (I) minus the number of respondents with a valid skip item for item x (V x ). When an abbreviated questionnaire is used to convert refusals, the eliminated questions are treated as item nonresponse.\" A student is defined to be an item respondent for an analytic variable if that student has data for that variable from any source, including logical imputation. As shown in table B-6, for the 90,746 responding sample students, the weighted item response rates for items used in this ED Tab for all students ranged from 82.5 percent to 100 percent. The item response rates by type of institution ranged from 68.0 percent to 100 percent. All of the items, except for income, had a response rate above 85 percent. The response rates for income were below 85 percent for all students and for four of nine types of institution. Therefore, a nonresponse bias analysis was conducted for the income item. The variables listed above in the student-level bias analysis section were used to compare the item respondents and nonrespondents. These variables are important to the study and will be related to many of the items being analyzed for low item response rates. For this item, the nonresponse bias was estimated as described in the above section for each of these variables known for both respondents and nonrespondents and tested (adjusting for multiple comparisons) to determine if the bias is significant at the 5 percent level.     Table B-7 shows that the income item has a large amount of significant bias prior to imputation. A byproduct of the imputation (described in the imputation section of this appendix) is the reduction or elimination of item-level nonresponse bias. Imputation reduces or eliminates nonresponse bias by replacing missing data with statistically plausible values. Missing data and the associated nonresponse bias for variables such as income are usually non-ignorable (i.e., the respondents' distribution patterns differ from those in the full population). Therefore, replacing missing data with plausible values results in imputed sample distributions that resemble full population distributions, thus reducing if not eliminating nonresponse bias. The use of carefully constructed imputation classes, donor-imputee matching criteria, and random hot-deck searches within imputation cells are all designed to ensure that imputed data are in fact plausible and that the nonresponse bias is ignorable within the imputation classes."}, {"section_title": "Cautions for Analysts", "text": "Multiple institutions.

For similar reasons, estimates of average aid amounts based on the NPSAS sample will probably differ from specific program amounts reported by the department's program offices.

For NPSAS:2000, the survey was restricted for the first time to institutions participating in Title IV student aid programs. According to the Data Analysis System for NPSAS:96, only about 1 percent of the sampled undergraduates were attending an institution not eligible to participate in the Department's Title IV aid programs. When students attending non-Title IV-eligible institutions were excluded from the NPSAS:96 sample, the percentage of undergraduates who received financial aid increased by less than 0.3 percent. This small change primarily affects comparisons of students enrolled in less-than-2-year and private for-profit institutions. When using the DAS from prior NPSAS studies for comparisons to NPSAS:2000 and NPSAS:04, analysts may want to filter cases in the prior studies (e.g. NPSAS:96 or NPSAS:93) based on the variable that identifies whether the student was sampled from an institution that was eligible to participate in Title IV aid programs (T4ELIG). Another design change was made beginning with NPSAS:90 to improve full-year estimates. NPSAS:87 sampled students enrolled in the fall (October). However, NPSAS:90 sampled students who were enrolled at four discrete points in time: summer (August), fall (October), winter (February), and spring (June). Since implementation of NPSAS in 1993, institutions have been asked to provide one list that represented students enrolled at any time during the respective financial aid award year. In NPSAS:87 and NPSAS:90, those students who were initially sampled in the fall could have been enrolled for the full academic year. Another difference to note is that Puerto Rico was not part of the sample in NPSAS:87. The final restricted data files and the NPSAS DAS software will allow users to produce estimates comparable to 1987 by selecting only students who were enrolled in the fall and excluding those sampled from Puerto Rico (see the variable description for COMPTO87 in the DAS). These estimates will reflect full-year amounts of aid for students who were enrolled in the fall. Such estimates, however, will not reflect total expenditures as reported by the Department's specific Title IV program offices. This difference will be explained more fully in the forthcoming methodology report. The estimates for average aid amounts in this report are only for aid recipients who received the specified type of aid. Further, average aid amounts for specific groups where most students do not receive aid are not reflective of the amount of support these students receive overall, and the type of support (e.g. whether it is grants, subsidized loans, unsubsidized loans, work-study, or some combination) is likely to differ. NCES recommends that readers not try to produce their own estimates such as the percentage of all students receiving aid or the numbers of undergraduates enrolled in the fall who received any aid, federal aid, state aid, etc., by combining estimates in this tabulation with the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) fall 2003 enrollment numbers. The IPEDS enrollment data include some students not eligible for NPSAS (e.g. those enrolled in U.S. Service Academies, those taking college courses while enrolled in high school).
