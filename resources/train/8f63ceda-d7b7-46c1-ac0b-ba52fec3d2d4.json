Analyses look at children's social-emotional self-perceptions at the end of the fifth grade as well as how these perceptions have changed during these later elementary school years.\nThe relationship between academic success and healthy social and emotional development is well established (Kauffman 2001; Reid, Gonzalez, Nordness, Trout, & Epstein 2004; Rosenblatt & Rosenblatt 1999; Wagner, 1995) . Children who enjoy successful relationships with their peers and teachers are most likely to succeed academically and this relationship is maintained throughout the school years (Kauffman, 2001; Rosenblatt & Rosenblatt 1999) . The relationship is reciprocal -children who experience school failure tend to act out or exhibit other maladaptive behaviors, and children with disruptive or troubling behaviors can alienate themselves from peers and teachers and end up excluded from many learning opportunities that come from positive relationships (Brier 1995; Horn & Packard 1995; Kauffman, 2001; Henricsson & Rydell 2004 ).\nThe transition from elementary school to middle school years can be a critical period for social and emotional development. This is the juncture where some children's feelings about themselves in relation to their peers markedly decline, and the time for some when socially inappropriate behaviors such as fighting, or internal feelings of anxiety or depression become impediments to healthy development. (Eccles 1999 ).\nThis paper describes children's perceptions of their social-emotional development in the period that for many children immediately precedes the transition to middle school -right at the end of fifth grade. Additionally, the changes in development from the end of third grade to the end of fifth grade are examined to describe the trajectory of development as children enter the middle school years. Overall self-perceptions are examined, as well as differences among children from different socio-demographic backgrounds and for children with different academic abilities."}, {"section_title": "Data Source", "text": "This data analyzed in this paper are from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten\nClass of 1998-99 (ECLS-K). Sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), part of the U.S. Department of Education's Institute of Education Sciences, the ECLS-K is a nationally representative sample of children enrolled in kindergarten in the fall of 1998, with a base-year sample of 22,782 children who attended 1,277 schools with kindergarten programs in the school year for 1998-99.

Fifth-grade scale scores were based on the mean values calculated from the items that composed each SDQ scale administered in fifth grade. 1 Changes between children's third-grade and fifth-grade SDQ scores were calculated by subtracting the third-grade SDQ score from the fifth-grade SDQ score for each of the three scales. 2 To complete the SDQ, children were read a series of behavioral statements about their perception of themselves and asked to respond on a scale from 1 to 4, including \"not at all true,\" \"a little bit 1 The standard deviations for each of the fifth grade SDQ scale scores are as follows: peer relationships = 0.63, externalizing problem behaviors = 0.68, and internalizing problem behaviors = 0.62. Thus, differences in group mean scale scores were considered substantive if they were statistically significant and greater than or equal to 25% of a standard deviation (0.16 on the peer relationships scale, 0.17 on the externalizing problem behaviors scale, and 0.15 on the internalizing problem behaviors scale. 2 The standard deviations for each of the SDQ change scores are as follows: peer relationships = 0.71, externalizing problem behaviors = 0.70, and internalizing problem behaviors = 0.71. Thus, differences in group mean scale scores were considered substantive if they were statistically significant and greater than or equal to 25% of a standard deviation (0.18 on the peer relationships scale, 0.17 on the externalizing problem behaviors scale, and 0.18 on the internalizing problem behaviors scale.\ntrue,\" \"mostly true,\" and \"very true.\" Children's scale scores on each of the SDQ scales represent the mean rating of the items included in the scale. The peer scale captured how easily they found it to make friends and to get along with children, as well as their perception of their popularity.\nThe final two scales were based on responses to items that characterize externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors. For instance, the externalizing problem behavior scale was based on responses to items about fighting and arguing with other children, disturbing others, and problems with distractibility. The internalizing problem behavior scale focused on behaviors such as feeling ashamed of mistakes, worrying about school and friendships, and expressing that they often feel sad and/or lonely."}, {"section_title": "Academic performance", "text": "The scores used in these analyses are from the reading and mathematics ECLS-K direct child cognitive assessments. The ECLS-K battery used a two-stage assessment approach in which the first stage in each domain contained a routing test that determined the child's approximate skills.\nAccording to the child's performance on the routing test, the child is administered one of the three skill level assessments in that domain (the second stage). This adaptive approach is used in all administrations of the assessments. The reading assessment includes basic literacy skills, vocabulary, and comprehension items. The mathematics assessment measures conceptual understanding of numbers, shapes, patterns, mathematical operations, and processes for problemsolving.

Fifth-grade children with the lowest third of reading assessment scores had peer relationship SDQ scores that declined 0.1 point between third and fifth grades, while scores for those in the highest reading ability group increased 0.1 points.

The internalizing problem behavior SDQ items tapped anxiety about school, feeling ashamed of mistakes, sadness, and loneliness.\nThe externalizing problem behavior items assessed behaviors such as fighting and arguing with other children, disturbing others, and problems with attention and distractibility. On average, children reported that the items on the externalizing problem behavior scale and the internalizing problem behavior scale were \"a little bit true\" for them, with means of 1.9 and 2.0, respectively (table 1) .\nChildren's reports of their problem behaviors at fifth grade varied by child characteristics (table   1) . In bivariate mean comparisons, boys were more likely than girls to indicate that they exhibited externalizing problem behaviors. Black children had higher reports of externalizing problem behaviors compared to Hispanic, White, and Asian children; and Hispanic and children from \"other\" race ethnicity groups had higher average scores than Asian children. Additionally, Black and Hispanic children had higher self-reports of internalizing problem behaviors compared to White and Asian children. Certain family risk factors measured in kindergarten were also related to children's reported perceptions of both internalizing and externalizing behavior problems at fifth grade. Living in a home with a household income below the federal poverty threshold, having a mother who did not have a high school diploma or equivalent, and living in a singleparent family were each associated with higher externalizing and internalizing SDQ scores.\nThe fifth-grade SDQ scores for problem behaviors (table 1) were also related to the children's reading ability and mathematics ability. Children in the lowest reading ability group had the highest SDQ scores for externalizing behaviors and internalizing behaviors compared to those in the middle third of the reading assessment scores; and this middle reading ability group had higher scores than those with the highest reading ability (figure A). Children in the lowest mathematics ability group had the highest SDQ scores for externalizing behaviors and internalizing behaviors compared to those in the middle third of the mathematics assessment scores; and the middle mathematics ability group had higher scores than those with the highest mathematics ability. Some of the bivariate findings were supported in the corresponding regression analyses (table 3) .\nFor instance, after accounting for other characteristics, higher levels of externalizing problem behaviors were reported by boys than girls, and by Black or \"other\" race/ethnicity children compared with Asian children.

Those with the lowest reading ability reported internalizing behaviors that were lower in fifth grade compared to third grade, while the group with the highest reading assessment scores had no average change in their internalizing problem behavior SDQ scores. Additionally, those with the lowest mathematics ability reported internalizing behaviors that declined further from third to fifth grade compared to those with the highest mathematics assessment scores. In the regression analyses where all characteristics are considered together, no factor met the criteria for a \"substantive difference\"."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "In the spring of the kindergarten year, ECLS-K teachers reported that most children tended to form friendships easily (82 percent), accept peer ideas in cooperative activities (77 percent) and few exhibited problem behaviors such as fighting with others (8 percent) or get angry easily (9 percent) (West, Denton, and Reaney 2001) . In the third and fifth grades, the ECLS-K children were given the opportunity to report for themselves about their peer relationships and any problem behaviors they may be exhibiting. Like they had in third grade, children in fifth grade expressed generally positive feelings about their ability to make and maintain friendships. Fifth grade children reported lower levels of internal problem behaviors (e.g., feeling ashamed of mistakes, worrying about school and friendships, and feelings of sadness or loneliness) than they had reported in third grade although these were generally low in both grades. Perceptions of externalizing problem behaviors (e.g., fighting and arguing with other children, disturbing others, or causing distractions) were low in both third and fifth grade.\nEven after accounting for other factors, fifth grade girls reported less externalizing problem behaviors compared to boys. There were some differences in perceptions associated with the children's race/ethnicity. For example, at fifth grade, Black children responded more positively about their peer relationships than Asian children. Black children reported higher levels of externalizing problem behaviors compared to Hispanic, White and Asian children, and Hispanic children reported higher externalizing problem behaviors compared to Asian children. Black and Hispanic children reported had higher levels of internalizing problem behaviors compared to White and Asian children None of these race/ethnicity differences persisted substantially after controlling for cognitive abilities and other characteristics, with the exception of the peer relationship scale. It appears that relationships between race/ethnicity and perceptions about problem behaviors can be largely attributed to other factors.\nFamily risk factors did not appear to be primary sources of differences in fifth graders social and emotional self-perceptions. Living in a home with a household incomes below the federal poverty threshold, having a mother who did not have a high school diploma or equivalent, and living in a single-parent family were each associated with higher externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors, but none of these relationships persisted after accounting for cognitive ability.\nThe type of school the child attended between kindergarten and fifth grade (public school at all rounds, private school at all rounds, or changed school type during the study) did not emerge as an important factor related to children perceptions at fifth grade or in their change in perceptions from third to fifth grade.\nChildren's cognitive ability in reading and mathematics appears to be important factors with regards to their problem behaviors. After accounting for other characteristics, those in the lowest ability group within each subject area (reading and mathematics) reported substantially higher levels of externalizing and internalizing behaviors at fifth grade compared to children in the corresponding highest ability groups. Associations between family risk factors and problem behaviors found in the bivariate analyses did not emerge as important factors after adjusting for these cognitive differences.\nThis paper finds that children who have lower cognitive achievement levels are not only losing some of their interest in school and optimism about their ability to do well in school (Eccles 1999 , Freedman-Doan et al. 2000 they are also more likely to be experiencing greater levels of both externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors as they end their elementary school years. As the ECLS-K follows the trajectories of children's growth into the eighth grade year in the spring of 2007, the important links between cognitive growth and student's social-emotional selfperceptions will continue to be studied.
