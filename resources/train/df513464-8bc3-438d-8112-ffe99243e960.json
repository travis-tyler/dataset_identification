[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Major hemodynamic alterations ensue with aging and are primarily attributable to central arterial stiffening; 1 these alterations become manifest in the ever expanding epidemic of hypertension affecting 1 of every 3 Americans in general, and a staggering rate of 7 of every 10 of those aged 65 and older. 2 The burden of this epidemic is projected to increase with the aging of our population as the percentage of people aged 65 and older increasing from 15% in 2014 to 22% in 2030. 3 This shift in demographics makes predominantly systolic hypertension, a challenging form hypertension that becomes more prevalent with advancing age and that dominates the hypertension field. 4 All of these factors make hypertension a growing health burden with a predicted hypertension-related health care costs reaching $389 billion in 2030. 5 Because aging is the major risk factor for predominantly systolic hypertension the pivotal question to effectively address this hypertension epidemic is: What underlies arterial aging? Evolutionary biologists proclaim that most of us are wired to be very healthy until around the end of child-bearing age, because the main reason for our reality, they would say, is to perpetually insure the next generation of our species; after that, from an evolutionary perspective, there is no essential reason for us to be alive. However, we do remain alive longer well beyond our evolutionary life expectancy prescription because our environment has been enhanced by improved hygiene, better nutrition, better health care, etc. But, in outliving our paleolithic gene set, disorder among molecules within our body progressively increases and functional declines accumulate with advancing age and beyond 40 years we become vulnerable to what are referred to as \"degenerative chronic diseases of aging\". Arterial aging and the associated alteration in hemodynamics are no exception. The hypertension field has been struggling to better understand the complex relationship between arterial wall mechanical changes, i.e. arterial wall stiffness, and hemodynamics, i.e. arterial pressure alterations, and has been fixated on defining: \"which factor is the culprit?\" The failure to reach an unequivocal answer is not surprising and is probably a reflection of the naivety of the question is. In health \"homeostasis\", a functional crosstalk between central and peripheral segments of the circulation is required for optimal operation. Once this homeostasis is broken, for any reason, a vicious cycle of minute alterations in central arterial mechanical and hemodynamics ensues and propagates, leading to the dramatic changes in arterial properties observed with aging. Thus, in this paradigm, it is close to impossible to detect the \"initial\" minute alteration and point to it as the \"culprit\". Given this extreme complexity, any efforts directed to treating or preventing the increase in blood pressure would be infertile without major efforts are committed to further explore the underpinning aging of the arterial wall. These efforts should be aimed at revealing early alterations, starting in young adulthood, before reaching the clinical threshold, and to develop stage/process-specific interventions rather than the\" one-size fits all\" approach that dominate the field of hypertension. In the meantime, targeting elements of this vicious cycle, \"the master perpetuators\" of arterial aging appears to be the most promising strategy to reduce the health burden of hypertension."}, {"section_title": "Age-Associated Dysfunction of Central Arteries and Hemodynamic", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Alterations", "text": "Epidemiological studies have pursued description of changes in arterial stiffness with aging and to answer the question of whether central arterial stiffness is a cause or an effect of elevated systolic and pulse blood pressure. One of the difficulties in addressing this issue relates to a degree of ambiguity and restrictions of the terms \"blood pressure\" and \"arterial stiffness\". This question might be better articulated if we expand these terms and rename \"arterial stiffness\" as \"arterial mechanical alterations\", and \"elevated blood pressure\" as \"hemodynamic alterations\"; then, it becomes apparent that arterial mechanical properties and hemodynamics are inseparable and the question on what starts first, mechanical or hemodynamic alterations appears to be somewhat na\u00efve."}, {"section_title": "In the beginning\u2026 Early 3 rd decade arterial mechanical alterations and the rise in diastolic blood pressure", "text": "The initial evidence of age-associated arterial mechanical alterations is observed by the third decade of age with sharp declines in aortic strain, the difference between aortic systolic and diastolic diameter relative to the diastolic diameter, and in aortic distensibility, i.e. aortic strain divided by pulse pressure; analysis of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging of 111 healthy participants have shown that nearly 80% of the total decline of aortic strain occurs before the 5th decade of age after which the decline in strain is less dramatic 6 ( Figure 1A), however the small decline in aortic strain beyond the age of 50 is was associated with an exponential increase in PWV with aging ( Figure 1B). During the same stages of life, as central arterial strain is becoming reduced, there is an increase in diastolic blood pressure, 7,8 which could be associated with progression of increased endothelial dysfunction with aging, leading to increased peripheral vascular resistance. While such changes are not very well studied in normal human subjects, those with essential hypertension demonstrate eutrophic, inward remodeling of small arteries, 9,10 It is not clear whether the increase in diastolic blood pressure alters the optimal conformation of the arterial wall, making it prone to an increase in hemodynamic stress, and to additional mechanical alterations beyond those resulting from simply stretching elastin fibers at higher pressures and shifting the load to the stiffer collagen fibers."}, {"section_title": "Beyond the 6 th Decade of Age: Central Arterial Mechanics and the Pulsatile Hemodynamic", "text": "Dramatic hemodynamic alterations ensue beyond the 6 th decade of life, as increases in SBP and PP become the hallmarks of arterial aging. 8 PWV and blood pressure parameters have been shown to be strongly associated in cross-sectional and prospective studies. 1112 The Framingham Heart Study, using data from Cycle 7 to predict SBP and PWV in Cycle 8, has shown that higher PWV in Cycle 7 is associated with higher SBP in Cycle 8; 13 however, the opposite was not true: SBP at Cycle 7 was not associated with higher PWV in Cycle 8. It is noteworthy, however, that one of the shortcomings of The Framingham Study design with a relatively short follow-up time of 7 years is that it does not address that the magnitude and the direction of association between SBP and PWV are not addressed and could change with aging and differ by gender; merely adjusting for these variables does not inform whether these associations differed between the different categories of these variables.

Earlier analyses from the BLSA have shown that greater PWV was associated with larger increase in SBP with aging, and predicted the incidence of hypertension. 14 Recent analysis from the BLSA, however, using linear mixed effects models, shed light on the vicious cycle, showing that higher SBP, in a dose-dependent fashion, is also associated with a greater rate of increase in PWV; this association was more pronounced in men with accelerating rates of increase in PWV at higher SBP with advancing age. 15 Dissociation between PWV and SBP trajectories-More recent insights on the longitudinal changes in PWV and SBP parameters came from the SardiNIA Study of concurrent trajectories of repeated measures of PWV and SBP; using linear mixed effects models allows the examination of whether the longitudinal changes of these parameters over time vary by starting age. 7 This analysis demonstrated a striking dissociation in the trajectories of these parameters with advancing age; a dissociation more pronounced in men than women. 7 Figures 2A and B illustrate the cross-sectional differences \"beginning of the splines\" and the longitudinal changes (slopes of the splines) with aging (Rates of changes are illustrated in the lower panels) of PWV and SBP in both men and women. In men ( Figure 2) PWV increased with age at rates that increase linearly with advancing age; however, although cross-sectional SBP continues to increase, the longitudinal rates of change, while initially increasing begin to decline with time, thus the rates of change in SBP diverge from those of PWV by the fifth decade. A similar, but a less dramatic, divergence is observed in women ( Figure 2); while, PWV showed the same pattern of longitudinal changes in men with linearly increasing rates of change with advancing age, SBP increased longitudinally at a steady, rather than increasing, rates throughout the age range studied. Preliminary analyses from the BLSA using the same approach of examining the concurrent trajectories showed a similar pattern of dissociations between PWV trajectories and those of SBP and PP, which were more pronounced in men than women. 16 Physiological explanations for the dissociation between PWV and the decline in SBP with aging in men-Dissociations between the rates at which PWV and SBP change over time bring our attention again to terminology; \"Arterial stiffness\" usually implies an increase in arterial opposition to flow i.e. characteristics (Z c ) impedance. However, Z c is a function of both PWV and aortic diameter squared. 17 Hence, an explanation for the dissociation between SBP and PWV longitudinal trajectories in men is an increase in aortic diameter. Preliminary analysis from the BLSA show a greater increase in aortic root dilatation with increasing age in men than in women. 16 The net effect of increasing PWV and aortic diameter approximated by applying the water hammer equation is, in fact, a less pronounced increase in calculated Z c in men despite their more pronounced increase in PWV which was offset by the greater increase in diameter. 16 These results are in agreement with cross-sectional data from the Asklepios study showing that with advancing age, men have lower Z c than women. 18 While aortic diameter and Z c might explain how PWV and SBP/PP trajectories would diverge, the role of wave reflection in this dissociation is not well clear and it is worth further examination."}, {"section_title": "Salt-sensitive hypertension and aging", "text": "The incidence of hypertension and salt-sensitivity increases with advancing age. [19][20][21][22][23] High NaCl intake in addition to its effect on blood pressure, 24 increases arterial stiffness by altering vascular structure, vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) and endothelial cell function, and producing arterial wall fibrosis. 25,26,27 Both clinical and experimental evidence indicate that NaCl induces hypertrophy of the arterial wall in the absence of changes in arterial pressure 26 and induces hypertrophy of cultured VSMC. 27 Excessive NaCl intake reduces the bioavailability of nitric oxide by interfering with the induction of nitric oxide synthase, 28 and by elevating levels of peroxinitrite due to an increase in NADPH oxidase activity, marker of oxidative stress, and production of reactive oxygen species. 29 These NaCl effects lead to hypertension by reducing arterial compliance and increasing peripheral vascular resistance (PVR), 30 and to oxidative damage to the arterial wall. 31 An age-associated decline in nitric oxide mediated dilation becomes particularly apparent during the 6 th decade, a time when pulse pressure, a barometer of large artery stiffness, begins to appreciably elevate. 32 "}, {"section_title": "The endogenous steroids, sodium pump ligands", "text": "Evidence is mounting that a NaCl-induced signaling cascade involving tissue renin angiotensin aldosterone signaling (RAAS), initiates the production of an endogenous ouabain-like substance in the brain, which then acts as a neurohormone to activate brain AT 1 R ( Figure 3). 33,34 Sympathetic signaling to the adrenal cortex leads to production of marinobufagenin (MBG), another recently discovered Na pump ligand that is an endogenous inhibitor of the alpha-1 isoform of the Na/K-ATPase (NKA), 35 which is the exclusive NKA isoform in renal tubules, and a main isoform in VSMC ( Figure 3). Inhibition of NKA i n renal tubular cells leads to decreased reabsorption of Na and promotes natriuresis. However, Na-pump ligands are not selective for renal NKA, but also inhibit N K A in the vasculature, leading to arterial constriction, and an increase in PVR and arterial blood pressure ( Figure  3). 35,36,37,38,39 Interestingly, compared to normotensive control, older patients with resistant hypertension demonstrate greater blood pressure and PWV, higher plasma MBG (an NKA inhibitor), and decreased erythrocyte NKA activity. 40 In this regard, it is of note that the increase in arterial pressure induced by a chronic high NaCl intake (i.e. salt-sensitive hypertension) in rodents is substantially reduced by an anti-MBG antibody. 35,41 The age-associated increase in the secretion of Na pump ligands, including MBG, linked to reduced r e n a l NaCl excretion, could be an explanation for the moderate increases in PVR in older persons with predominantly systolic hypertension. The effects of MBG to increase PVR in salt-sensitive hypertension may be substantially enhanced via their interaction with other vasoactive substances that are implicated in the pathogenesis of NaCl-dependent effects to increase arterial pressure. A NaCl induced up regulation of the tissue activity of RAAS, via PKC dependent phosphorylation of the Na/K-pump, may sensitize this pump to both vasoconstrictive and NaCl-dependent growth promoting MBG effects. 42 Additionally, NaCl-dependent angiotensin II (Ang II) signaling induced deficit in the bioavailability of endothelium-derived vasorelaxants, e.g., nitric oxide and C-type natriuretic peptide, which oppose the vasopressor action of MBG, but enhance its adaptive natriuretic action, may further reinforce the deleterious effects of the Na pump ligand. Thus, Na pump ligands, including MBG, link high dietary salt intake to the increase in arterial stiffness and hypertension. 20,21,34,36,43 High salt intake is associated with an increase in MBG and is accompanied by marked salt-sensitivity of blood pressure. 44,45 Dietary sodium restriction is an effective lifestyle approach for reducing both blood pressure and arterial stiffness in middle-age and older individuals. 46,47 In older humans after 5 weeks of a low salt diet vs. 5 weeks of a normal salt diet a reduction in urinary MBG excretion was positively related to reductions in urinary Na excretion and arterial stiffness ( Figure 4). 48 Furthermore, the expression of NADPH oxidase was correlated with MBG levels, indicating that low-salt-dependent reduction in MBG may contribute to the reductions in large elastic artery stiffness and SBP through decreased oxidative stress. 48 Thus, MBG is a molecular link of increased salt-sensitivity and arterial stiffness in aging."}, {"section_title": "Interaction of MBG and ANP in age-dependent salt-sensitivity", "text": "In addition to MBG, high salt intake stimulates atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) ( Figure 5). 49 Inhibition of renal NKA by MBG is enhanced via ANP-dependent phosphorylation of NKA, whereas, in the aorta, ANP exerts the opposite effect. 50 Vasorelaxant ANP and vasoconstrictor MBG potentiate each other's natriuretic effects, but ANP may offset the deleterious vasoconstrictor effect of MBG. 50 An imbalance of ANP-MBG signaling increases with advancing age and is a factor that underlies the phenomenon of saltsensitivity of blood pressure with aging. 50 ANP sensitizes renal NKA to MBG inhibitory activity and reduces MBG-induced inhibition of vascular NKA via cyclic guanosine monophosphate/protein kinase G-dependent mechanism (cGMP/PKG). Because downregulation of cGMP/PKG signaling is associated with aging, ANP does not potentiate renal effects of MBG and does not oppose vasoconstrictive effects of MBG in older rats ( Figure 6). 49,50 The NaCl-dependence of blood pressure in older persons with predominantly systolic hypertension can be attributed to multiple mechanisms that underlie arterial compliance and vascular resistance. Excessive dietary NaCl may also alter vascular structure and function via Ang II or Na pump ligands driven mechanisms (Figure 7) in the setting of age-associated reductions in renal blood flow and in the ability to excrete Na. NaCl activates tissue Ang II and MBG, affects endothelial and vascular cell functions and affects arterial structural remodeling, which results in arterial stiffening (Figure 7). NaCl also activates ANP, via a cGMP/PKG-dependent mechanism that attenuates pro-fibrotic effect of MBG on vascular NKA (see below). 50 Remarkably, both phenomena, MBG-dependent activation of profibrotic signaling and down-regulation of cGMP/PKG-dependent signaling, which accelerates the pro-fibrotic and pro-hypertensive MBG effects, are the hallmarks of arterial aging ( Figure 6). 50 Pro-fibrotic MBG activity, involving MBG/NKA association, is considered to be an important therapeutic target for immunoneutralization and modulation of MBG/NKA interactions in salt-sensitivity and in aging. Excessive dietary NaCl, in fact, may be an etiologic factor in the increased central arterial stiffening that accompanies advancing age, and the attendant age-associated increase in pulse pressure, as this does not occur in populations that do not consume excess NaCl. 24 The combined effects of NaCl to increase arterial stiffness and resistance progresses to the point of raising systolic pressure, in nearly half of the individuals in our society, to the current epidemiologically defined hypertensive threshold (140 mm Hg). It is imperative, therefore, that we not lose sight of the reality that the NaCl baseline diet consumed in the US population at large, is 60% higher than the DASH recommendations 47,51 and appears to accelerate aging, and to increase the likelihood of salt-sensitive hypertension."}, {"section_title": "An age-associated increase in renin angiotensin aldosterone signaling (RAAS) in VSMC promotes central arterial wall remodeling", "text": "Age-associated changes in vascular structure/function, per se, set the stage for the pathogenesis of vascular diseases such as hypertension in older persons.

Incubation of rat aortic rings with MBG reduces aortic Fli1, increases collagen-1, and attenuates relaxation of aorta.
