[{"section_title": "New and beginning farmers", "text": "The population currently engaged in US agriculture is poised to make a dramatic change -more than 50 percent of current farmers are likely to retire in the next five years (Mishra and El-Osta, 2007). US farmers over age 55 control more than half the farmland, while the number of new farmers replacing them has fallen. For example, the number of farm operators 35 years or younger has declined by 86 percent since the Farm Crisis period, 1982 and now makes up only 20 percent of farmers and ranchers. Paralleling this shift in production, agriculture is in a decline in overall farm numbers through exits and consolidation in search of scale economies and production efficiencies. Concern in many states arises because the loss adversely affects the future of family farms, the farm economy and healthy rural communities (USDA, 2008). Additionally, the rapid decline in the entry of new and young farmers is an indication of rising barriers to entry, resulting in calls from within the farming community for public policy measures designed to aid new and beginning farmers. The issue of new and beginning farmers is of such concern that the 2002 Farm Bill directed the USDA to initiate special programs for new and beginning farmers. For example, under the Credit Title (Title V), the 2002 Farm Bill requested that the Farm Service Agency set up \u2022 guarantee of loans made under State beginning farmer or rancher programs; \u2022 beginning farmer and rancher contract land sales programs; and \u2022 reservation of funds for direct operating loans for beginning farmers and ranchers. Finally, the Farm Credit Administration is currently seeking changes to lending rules in order to aid new and beginning farmers and ranchers. Although there is an abundance of literature that investigates the financial performance of cash grain farms (see Fox el al., 1993;Rougoor et al, 1998;Mishra etal., 1999;Garcia et al., 1982;Sonka etal., 1989) and dairy farms (Kauffman and Tauer, 1986;Ford and Shonkwiler, 1994;Mishra and Morehart, 2001;Haden andJohnson, 1989: El-Osta andJohnson, 1998;Gloy and LaDue, 2003;Gloy et al., 2002), there is a paucity of work that investigates factors that influence the financial performance of new and beginning farm (NBFR) households. As noted by Mishra et al. (2002), young farm operators and their spouses are more educated and more likely to work off the farm. As a result, an increasing portion of household income will be generated off farm, and decisions regarding the farm are made jointly by operators and spouses within the household. The decision to invest the needed funds to operate a successful farm will be increasingly scrutinized by multiple decision makers. Farming is a capital intensive industry requiring a significant initial investment to begin operations: therefore, there are significant economies of size in agricultural production. NBFR are at a distinct disadvantage because it is difficult for them to realize these economies when they are beginning operations. Land values and rental rates in the major program crop regions have significantly increased. As a result, the cost structure of NBFR is often higher than existing farms operating at a more economical scale. An NBFR must rapidly acquire information about how to farm, how to manage a farm business, how to adhere to regulations and how to make the business profitable. This is particularly true for many NBFRs who are constantly seeking ways to reduce farming time, reduce costs and increase profits. Further, reduction in farming AFR time may help NBFRs to focus more on off-farm activities and increase household 692 income. Hence, the objective of this paper is to investigate the factors (farm, operator and household characteristics, along with farm type and regional location of the farm) affecting financial performance of new and beginning farmers and ranchers. A better understanding of the characteristics that influence returns and/or profits (financial 162 performance) would be quite useful to NBFR who wish to make changes in their farming operations so as to increase returns. Another benefit is to better educate policymakers who wish to or are concerned with improving performance of NBFRs. Measuring financial performance is particularly important for the control function and information derived from financial measures, such as profits, allowing the NBFR act as an informed manager making strategic plans and tracking their progress relative to the firm's goals.\nTheir reviews concluded that personal attributes and goals were important in explaining profitability differences across farms. The inclusion of farm operator characteristics such as education may yield some insight into the influence of training, experience and demographics on farm business financial performance. These factors affect the production function (Huffman, 1977;Becker, 1975). Huffman (1977) and Lins et al. (1987) show that higher levels of farm operator education are likely to induce new technology adoption. Education is hypothesized to have a positive effect on financial performance, as predicted by human capital theory. Better educated farmers tend to be more successful and to receive the same or better returns from farming as elsewhere. Warren (1932), using cross-classification analysis, found that operators of higher income dairy farms in New York had a higher than average level of education. Cunningham-Dunlop (1982) assessed the effect of education on farm profits in Canada. She concluded that net returns to education in Canadian agriculture were positive. On the other hand, Laband and Lentz (1983) and Osburn (1978) found a negative effect for education on farm financial performance. In the late 1990s, Tauer and Stefanides (1998), when examining the profitability of dairy farms in New York (1984. 1993), found that New York dairy farms violated the weak axiom of profit maximization (WAPM) roughly half the time. The authors concluded that the considered farms, on average, could have improved performance by approximately 20 percent by selecting a better mix of inputs and outputs. Tauer and Stefanides found that age and education of the farm operator were modestly significant in explaining deviation from the WAPM. More recentl y, Gloy and LaDue (2003) andGloy et al. (2002) used operator age as a variable in explaining the financial performance of dairy farms in New York. In both studies, this variable proved to be insignificant. In this study we use operator age (OP _AGE), possibly reflecting farming experience and farm operator educational level, with those having some college education SCOLL_EDU) and those having completed college (COLL_EDU) as factors affecting the financial performance of NBFR. Finally, as pointed out by Gloy et al. (2002), human capital resources go beyond the primar y farm operator. Many farms have two to three operators who specialize in various operations (such as production, marketing, capital management and human resource management) and are involved in the day-to-day decision-making process. Their specialization and decision making are hard to measure in any survey. Furthermore, it is difficult to obtain accurate data regarding strategies and practices used by each of these operators related to leadership, motivations and firm specific knowledge. The 2005 ARMS survey queried the primary operator on the number of individuals involved in the da y-to-day decisions for the farming operation. In this study, we use M_DECISION to assess the impact of a number of day-to-day decision makers on the financial performance of farms owned and or operated by NBFRs. Several farm production characteristics are hypothesized as contributing positively to a farm's financial performance: nonfarm income, machinery value per dollar of output, participation in government commodity programs, ratio of cash operating expenses (Plumley and Hornbaker, 1991) and diversification (Newbery and Stiglitz, 1981). Newbery and Stiglitz (1981) note that crop diversification is one way in which farmers can reduce risk and variability associated with farm income. Farm diversification, as measured by an entropy index (F_DIVERSE) and popularized by Theil[4], is used as an explanatory variable in the model because of the several desirable properties it possesses (see Hackbart and Anderson, 1978). We assume that diversification may lead to economies of scope, which lower costs and increase AFR 69,2 168 profits (ROA) (Chavas and Aliber, 1993). Haden and Johnson (1989) examined the relationship between farm income and milk sales as a percentage of total farm sales for a sample of Tennessee dairy farms. Milk sales as a percentage of total farm sales were negatively related to cash farm income but were not related to net farm income; however, Purdy et at. (1997) found contradictory evidence when they assessed the financial performance of a sample of Kansas farms. Specifically, they reported certain specializations, such as swine, dairy and crop production, increased mean financial performance. Therefore, one cannot predict the effect of F_DIVERSE on ROA. Farm size is another factor related to financial performance (Boessen ci at., 1990;Ford and Shonkwiler, 1994;Haden and Johnson, 1989;Kauffman and Tauer, 1986;Sonka et at., 1989). Farm size is expected to be positively associated with financial performance (ROA). This is in line with Barlett's (1984) notion that larger and more resource-endowed farms are better able to take advantage of sophisticated, productivity-enhancing technology and are ultimately more likely to generate higher incomes. Managerial ability has been included in a number of producer studies. Managerial abilit y has been represented in regression models by a set of demographic variables or production practices (Sumner and Leiby, 1987;Mykrantz et at., 1990). Managerial practices, in general, have been found to be important to the financial success of farming operations (Sonka et al, 1989). However, there is no clear consensus arising from previous studies on what variables represent management or accurately assess managerial ability. Ford and Shonkwiler (1994) used latent variables such as crop, financial and dairy management practices as proxies that reflect financial success of dairy farms in Pennsylvania. Their findings show that management measures such as milk sold per cow, milk sold per man, veterinary expenses per cow, and heifers and calves per cow are more important determinants of farm financial success than financial management (e.g. equity-to-asset ratio, operating margin and debt per cow) or crop performance (e.g. crop acres per cow, crop acres per man and crop expenses per acre). Hoffman (1996) indicated that well-managed farms, based on farm records, are better able to compete in per-unit profitability with farms man y times larger. In our study, we use two different variables to measure the impact of managerial ability on financial performance of NBFR. A business plan is an essential part of any business, and serves as a road map to describe the business and its future plans. The first variable, business plan (M_BPLAN), is used as a dumm y variable to study the impact of an extant business plan on the financial performance of farms that are owned/ operated by NBFR and is hypothesized to have a positive impact on ROA. The second variable, M_COMKEEP, relates to an operators keeping computerized books and records, is also used as a proxy for managerial ability. The notion being that farmers who keep computerized records of income and expenditures (bookkeeping) are more likely to keep track of their income and expenses (Mishra ci at., 1999) and are more able to make more sound farming decisions. Management of any farm requires making decisions related to all phases of operation consistent with resource availability and operator's objectives. Johnson and Morehart (2006) report that operator-and-spouse management teams in 2003 controlled 59 percent of the farms. Managers of farm businesses make choices about inputs and their use in producing crops, livestock or other products and services. Decision makers may specialize in one or more management decision, such as production decisions, financial decisions, and human resource decisions. Production decisions focus on whether to produce crops, livestock, both, or nothing (for example, by placing land in New and beginning farmers conservation). Financial decisions center on acquiring and maximizing the use of inputs. Human resource issues include the amount and timing of labor needed to undertake production. Johnson and Morehart argue that as a farm grows, expertise to handle these tasks either has to be available within the existing owner-operatormanagement arrangement or be acquired by adding to the management team. Survey results suggest the size and composition of management teams align with the complexity of farm businesses. In this study we have included the number of decision makers on the farm (M_DECISION) in order to assess the impact of the number of decision makers on financial performance of NBFR. Kauffman and Tauer (1986) use hay ratio (haylage as a proportion of all hay) as a measure of technology adoption. They point out that farmers who adopted haylage production technology, over dry hay, significantly improved their farm's probability of success. Based upon the information of farmers' technology adoption (first in the county, second, wait and see), Mishra et al. (1999) found that farmers who adopt a proven technology (operators willing to try a new technology even though it has been tried by only relatively few operators in the county) are more likely to have higher returns. Adoption and use of the internet by farmers has been discussed in farm management literature. Holt (1985) points out that a farmer's adoption and use of computers and the internet depends on the anticipated impact of technology on a farm's financial performance and competitiveness. Purchasing and selling through the internet may enhance efficiency by \"increasing the accuracy with which prices reflect true market conditions\" (Henderson, 1984). Therefore, in this study we include a dumm y variable, M_INTERNET, to assess the impact of internet on returns to farming for NBFR."}, {"section_title": "Defining new and beginning operators", "text": "NBFR operators can be defined in a variet y of ways. Sociological studies may define new and beginning operators by generational differences, say by 20-year age interval bands. Studies related to educational services may group new and beginning operators by \"high school,\" \"college student' and \"post graduate.\" The Farm Service Agency defines new and beginning farmers and ranchers as those who have participation in farm ownership and operating loan programs. Additionally, an NBFR must have an operation that is no larger than 30 percent of the average size farm in their particular county. A further requirement for direct operating loan participation requires that the applicant must have participated in the business operation for at least three years. On the other hand, NBFR operators are often defined by eligibility status in some farm programs. The following is a widely used definition describing an NBFR: \"Any individual or entity who has been operating a farm or ranch for less than ten years and materially participates in its operation.\" This is the definition used for participation under the Conservation Security Program and the Environmental Quality Incentives Program. Further, this is the definition that we employ in our study to define new and beginning farmers. By such a definition, when using 2005 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) survey, about 20 percent of primary farm operators have less than ten years of experience and are NBFRs."}, {"section_title": "Data source for new and beginning operators", "text": "Data for this analysis are from the 2005 ARMS. ARMS is conducted annually by the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Agricultural Statistics Service. The survey collects data to measure the financial condition (farm income, expenses, assets and debts) and operating characteristics of farm businesses, the cost of producing agricultural commodities and the well-being of farm operator households. The target population of the survey is operators associated with farm businesses representing agricultural production in the 48 contiguous states. A farm is defined as an establishment that sold or normally would have sold at least $1,000 in agricultural products during the year. Farms can be organized as proprietorships, partnerships, family corporations, nonfamily corporations or cooperatives. Data are collected from one operator per farm, the senior farm operator. A senior farm operator is the operator who makes most of the day-to-day management decisions. For the purpose of this New and beginning farmers study, operator households organized as nonfamily corporations or cooperatives and farms run solely by hired managers were excluded. The 2005 ARMS collected information on farm households in addition to farm business data. For example, it collected detailed information on off-farm hours worked by spouses and farm operators, the amount of income received from off-farm work, net cash income from operating another farm/ranch, net cash income from operating another business and net income from share renting. The heavy emphasis in off-farm employment of operators and spouses suggests (see 'Fable I) that farm household have an alternate goal to generating maximum household income for the farm business operation [ I]. Furthermore, income received from other sources, such as disability, social security unemployment payments, and gross income from interest and dividends, was also counted. The 2005 ARMS contains a sample of 983 farms, whose primary operators had less than ten years of farming experience and thus could be classified as farms operated by NBFRs. This sample, when expanded using sampling weights, represents a population of 412,321 farms operated by NBFR at the national level (Table I). The survey design of ARMS allows each sampled farm to represent a number of farms that are similar, referred to as a survey expansion factor. The expansion factor, in turn, is defined as the inverse of the probability of the surveyed farm being selected. The weighted means (expanded by the expansion factor, which is the weight) procedure is used to extrapolate a representative sample to a population. This is based on the procedure that is specific to ARMS data (see Dubman for details). Table I also shows that, on average, NBFRs operate small farms (about 168 acres), the majority of which are owned; however, NBFRs are twice (11 percent) as likely to be tenants[2] as compared to all other farm operators (5 percent) and approximately twice as likely to specialize in general livestock farming. Focusing on the regional location and farming type of NBFRs, Table I shows that NBFR farms are more likely to be located in the Southern Plains, Corn Belt and Appalachia regions of the USA and are likely to be engaged in beef cattle and general livestock operations (Table I). Among other things, viable farm business ventures are a by-product of business planning (Johnson and Morehart, 2006). A completed business plan expands upon opportunities and determines whether a new business venture is feasible or not. Developing a business plan is a process that helps farmers focus on factors necessary for future business success (Johnson and Morehart, 2006). An initial benefit of engaging in the business planning process is assisting[3] farmers in defining realistic goals that will make their proposed venture viable into the future. Organizing thoughts and ideas into a formal plan sets farms on a path of success and also provides a means to measure actual outcomes against business goals Uohnson and Morehart, 2006). In 2005, farm operators were queried to determine whether they had a written business plan. Results show that about 14 percent of NBFR had written business plans. Income statements comparison by operator experience: Experienced primary farm operators yielded an average net farm income approximately 5.5 times larger (about 815,772 in 2005) than NBFRs (82,839 in 2005). Generally, relative to experienced farm operators, NBFRs had a lower gross cash income, a larger percentage of income from livestock sources (42 vs 35 percent), and recorded higher feed expenses as a percentage of total expenses. An added item contributing to the higher expense percentage for NBFRs was due to interest. During 2005, experienced operators reported 5.9 percent of cash expenses while NBFRs reported 10.6 percent of cash expenses were for interest paid. 165 Notes: 'Includes wage and salary income of operators and spouses and off-farm business income; bincludes income from interest dividends accounts, retirement accounts and public assistance Source: Agricultural and Resource Management Survey, 2005 Balance sheets comparison by operator experience: Since many NBFRs may not be owners of their land, farm assets was about half of experienced farmers, $431,504 and $831,317, respectively. Since, average farm debt of NBFRs and all other farmers were similar, it is not surprising that farm net worth (farm assets minus farm debt) of NBFRs was about half of experienced farmers, $375,576 compared to $754,626 in 2005 (Table 11). This difference is reflected in the farm asset side of the balance sheet of NBFRs. Farm assets of NBFR were found to contain about half the asset value that the balance sheet of experienced farm operator balance sheets recorded. The liabilities side of the balance sheet on average was about equal (about $56,000 in 2005). A lower level of equity and higher debt-to-asset ratios are typical business conditions of operators who are in the first ten years of business operations. Table II also shows that about 13 percent of operated farms are vulnerable, compared to only 2 percent of farms operated by experienced farmers. The nonfarm net worth of NBFRs was slightly higher (about $237,000) than nonfarm net worth of experienced farm operators (about $233,000, Table II).

Returns to assets (ROA) are a widely used measure of financial performance (Barry ci al., 1995) that can be influenced by many aspects of the farm business.

The general model"}, {"section_title": "69,2", "text": "provides the basis for estimating farm financial performance of NBFRs. ROA, a measure of financial performance widely used in the farm management literature, is the ratio of net farm income plus interest payment to total assets. This measure is used in this study and is defined as ROA-(NetFarmIncome + InterestPaYments) (2) TotalFarmAssets where NetFarmlncome is the accrual net farm income and 'I'otalFarmAssets is the market value of farm assets in 2005. This measure has been used by Gloy and LaDue (2003) and Gloy et al. (2002) to measure financial performance of farmers in New York. ROA is hypothesized to be a function of operator/farm characteristics and management strategies used to manage the farm. Specifically, we estimate the following equation using a weighted least-squares procedure: ROA is net farm income, including interest payments, per dollar of assets, A ij are a set of operator, farm and financial characteristics and Cj is a vector of parameters to be estimated. The independent variables hypothesized to affect the farm's financial performance encompass the three following areas: farm operator characteristics, farm characteristics such as production and marketing efficiency measures and management strategies. They are presented in Table Ill. Because ARMS data have a complex survey design and are cross-sectional, the possibility is raised that the error terms are heteroscedastic. A Breusch-Pagan/Cook-Weisberg test for the presence of heteroscedasticity in (3), performed using STATA, Version 9.2 (StataCorp, 2005), confirmed its occurrence (for more details, see Judge et al., 1985, p. 446). Accordingly, all standard errors were adjusted for heteroscedasticity using the Huber-White sandwich robust variance estimator based on algorithms contained in STATA (see Huber, 1967;White, 1980).\n1. With a growing rural population, many of whom are defined as 'farmers\" within the definitions which apply to USDA's agricultural surveys ($1,000 in sales for a 'normal\" year), we obviously begin to find more 'lifestyle\" farmers. 'Lifestyle\" farmers have alternative farming goals. For example, as opposed to farming for profit, they may farm for other amenities of a rural lifestyle such clean air, less noise, open spaces and less 176 congestion. Combining these farmers with farmers who are in business to farm for profit is discordant. While the objective of this paper is not to look at the relationship between farm business goals and profitability, it is important to recognize that alternate goals exist within the group of farm operators selected for analysis. 2. Hundred percent of the land is rented for the group of farms falling under this classification. 3. Assistance could be provided by extension agents and/or bankers. Johnson and Morehart conclude that for a successful farming business one has to have a realistic business plan. 4. It is important to note the F_DIVERSE takes a value of 1 when a farm is diversified and 0 when a farm is specialized. 5. In this model we ignore risk preference and uncertainty. Additionally, we assume that technology is fixed. 6. The ERS developed a farm typology which categorizes farms into more homogeneous groups than do classifications based on sales volume alone, producing a more effective policy development tool.

These levels of explained variation in Table IV are fairly typical when the analyses are based on cross-sectional data (El-Osta and Johnson, 1998). The F-statistic, which tests the joint significance of the independent variables included in the model, is significant at the 1 percent level of significance (Table IV). Several significant findings emerge from the analysis as reported in Table IV. The age of the operator (OP _AGE) is negative and statistically significant at 5 percent level of significance. This finding is consistent with the fact that young farmers have fewer assets, with corresponding likelihood of lower financial performance. When farmers get older, however, the situation is often reversed (about age 25) as evidenced by the significant positive relationship between OP_AGESQ and ROA -showing a classical inverted U-shaped curve.

Haden and Johnson (1989) report a similar finding in their study of dairy farms in Tennessee. Higher education and financial performance are negatively related for NBFR. The coefficient of COLL_EDU, farm operators with college degrees and beyond, is negative and statistically significant at the 5 percent level of significance (Table IV). This result may imply that better educated farmers are likely to get higher returns to human capital from off-farm work, are likely to work off the farm and in the process have a negative impact on the farm's financial performance ROA). The coefficient of OPF_WAGE is negative and statistically significant at less than 5 percent level of significance. Results indicate that NBFRs who work off the farm in wage and salaried jobs have 1.3 percent lower farm financial performance. These results are consistent with the findings of Mishra et al. (1999). Results in Table IV show that, compared to full owners, tenants (F_TENANT) have higher ROA. These findings are consistent with the fact that tenants do not own farm assets (i.e. land), are very involved in production agriculture, have better knowledge of the soil productivity and farming conditions in the area and are less likely to work off the farm. Results here indicate that being a tenant increases ROA by approximately 3.4 percent. Controlling variable costs of production is another important variable that contributes to the success of farm firms.

The coefficient of FNTERLINK is positive and statistically significant indicating that farms involved in processing the agriculture product, or value-added activities, are more likely to have higher ROA. This finding may reflect the fact that value-added farming may be important to NBFRs."}, {"section_title": "AFR 69,2 174", "text": "The coefficient of farm size (F_SIZE) has the expected sign and is significant at the 10 percent level of significance. These results are consistent with the findings of Ford and Shonkwiler (1994), Haden and Johnson (1989), El-Osta and Johnson (1998) and Mishra et aL (1999). These results suggest overall economies of scale, indicating that a $10,000 increase in value of agricultural production increases ROA by 0.1 percent. According the ERS[6] farms could be classified into three collapsed farm typology, namely, rural residence farms, intermediate farms and large farms. Results in Table IV show that rural residence (F_RURALRES) farms have a lower financial performance when compared to large farms. This is in line with expectations because the rural residence category includes limited-resource, retirement and residential lifestyle farms where most operators are either retired or work off the farm. The coefficient of debt-toasset ratio (DEBT _ASSET) is positive and statistically significant at the 1 percent level of significance. Results indicate that a 1 percent increase in debt-to-asset ratio increases ROA of NBFRs by approximately 3.4 percent. This is consistent with the fact that farms that achieve a rate of ROA above the rate of interest on debt should have greater access to leverage and be more willing to use debt, because such a strategy would increase ROA. Many farmers are entrepreneurial and have numerous options to consider when changing the way they do business. Johnson and Morehart (2006) point out that successful farm business have written business plans. The coefficient of M_BPLAN is positive and statistically significant at the 5 percent level of significance, indicating that NBFR who have written business plans have higher financial performance (ROA) compared to NBFRs with no written business plan. One possible explanation is that having a written business plan may help NBFR obtain loans and grants from banks, state agencies and regional agricultural development agencies. Many states in the USA have separate funds dedicated to assist NBFR. However, in all of the cases the authorities require farm operators to have a business plan, income statement and financial balance sheet. This result may also reflect the fact that NBFR who have business plans are more dedicated farmers and are determined to make a difference in their farming business through better management and planning of resources. The coefficient of number of decision makers on the farm (M_DECISION) is positive and statistically significant at the 1 percent level of significance. Results indicate that an increase in the number of persons making farm management decisions increases farm financial performance (ROA) by 2.4 percent. This finding is consistent with Johnson and Morehart's (2006) argument that various people in the management process have expertise in various aspect of farm management that can help in the financial progress of the firm and ultimately the bottom line of the farm. Results in Table IV show that the coefficient on M_COMPKEEP is positive and statistically significant at the 1 percent level of significance, indicating that computerized income and expense record keeping increases ROA by about 4.2 percent. These results are consistent with the findings of Mishra et at. (1999). Government farm programs are intended to decrease agricultural producers' risks (Goodwin and Schroeder, 1994), i.e. price support programs help reduce producers' price risk by assuring a guaranteed return. As reported in the literature, government commodity programs have often been identified as the primary risk-reducing mechanism for many farmers, especially those producing cash grains (Calvin, 1992;Kramer and Pope, 1981;Musser and Stamoulis, 1981). In this study, we include two variables that represent two types of government program payments. The first variable includes both direct (often called decoupled from production decisions) and"}, {"section_title": "1W", "text": "New and beginning farmers indirect (coupled to production, such as loan deficiency payments) payment (GP -PAYMENT). The second is conservation reserve program payments (GP-CRP). The coefficient on G1'PAYMENT is positive and statistically significant, suggesting that NBFRs who receive direct, indirect or both kinds of government payments increase their financial performance (ROA). Results show that a $1,000 increase in GP -PAYMENT increases ROA by 0.1 percent. Finally, financial performance can vary with the farming regions. The geographic location of the farm determines its cropping pattern, rainfall amounts and productivity. In this study we included farm resource regions as described by the ERS 17], with eight dummies in the regression to capture regional impact on financial performance. The Mississippi Portal region was treated as the base region. Results in Table IV show that, in all regions, farms operated by NBFRs had lower ROA than those in the benchmark region (Mississippi Portal region). A possible explanation is the tenancy rate in the Mississippi Portal is higher than other regions in the USA. Further, the Mississippi Portal region has had a high proportion of small and large farms that specialize in hog, poultry, cotton and rice."}, {"section_title": "Summary and conclusions", "text": "With renewed focus on NBFRs in the policy arena, this study identifies factors that contribute to the financial performance of NBFRs in the USA. A weighted regression analysis was used on farm-level data from the 2005 ARMS to measure the financial performance of NBFRs. Results from this study show that although there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between age of the operator and financial performance, management strategies such as increasing the number of decision makers, engaging in value-added farming and having a written business plan can lead to higher financial performance. Written business plans may help NBFRs obtain loans and grants from banks, state agencies and regional agricultural development agencies. Further, results from this study indicate that financial performance of NBFRs is affected by educational attainment of the operator, size of operation, and controlling variable costs of production. Our analysis shows that younger and more educated NBFR farm operators have lower financial performance. Risk management strategies like participation in government farm programs contributed toward higher financial performance, while off-farm work reduced farm financial performance (ROA). With more than 50 percent of the current farmers likely to retire in the next five years (Mishra and El-Osta, 2007), and with increasingly fewer NBFRs coming into agriculture, concern has arisen regarding the future of farms and agriculture in the USA. Since the 2002 Farm Bill, the USDA has been directed to create special programs targeted for NBFRs. Our research provides important results for farmers who want to increase their returns and for policy makers who wish to formulate policies targeted at assisting NBFRs. Results indicate three important activities for increasing financial performance are improved human capital by increasing the number of decision makers on the farm, engaging in value-added agriculture and creating a written business plan. Additionally, NBFRs can gain traction in the field of agriculture by starting as a tenant and fully employing their borrowed money into productive and high return enterprises. Programs that encourage NBFRs to control variable costs, participate in risk management strategies such as government farm programs and keep track of income and expenditures analysis of income statements may also help improve financial performance."}, {"section_title": "AFR", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Notes", "text": ""}]
