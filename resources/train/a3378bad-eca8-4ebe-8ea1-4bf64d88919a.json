It is organized as a series of indicators, with each indicator presenting data on a different aspect of school crime and safety. The report provides updated data on nonfatal student victimization; nonfatal victimization of teachers; students' perceptions of personal safety; gangs; students' reports of being bullied, avoiding places, being called hate-related words, and seeing hate-related graffiti; and students' reports of being threatened or injured with a weapon, being in fights, carrying weapons at school, using alcohol and marijuana, and drug availability on school property. This year's report also includes data from last year's Indicators of School Crime and Safety on principal reports of selected crimes; principal reports of disciplinary problems and actions at school; and fatal student victimization. This report is organized in five sections, starting with a description of the most serious violence: Violent Deaths at School; Nonfatal Student Victimization-Student Reports; Violence and Crime at School-Public School Reports; Nonfatal Teacher Victimization at School-Teacher Reports; and School Environment. Each section contains a set of indicators that, taken together, describe a distinct aspect of school crime and safety. Rather than relying on data from a large omnibus survey of school crime and safety, this report uses a variety of independent data sources from federal departments and agencies, including BJS, NCES, the FBI, and the CDC. Each data source has an independent sample design, data collection method, and questionnaire design. By combining multiple and independent sources of data, this report aims to present a more complete portrait of school crime and safety than would be possible using any single source of information. However, because the report relies on so many data sets, the age groups, time periods, and types of respondents analyzed can vary from indicator to indicator. Readers should keep these variations in mind when they compare data from different indicators. Readers should also note that trends in the data are discussed when possible. Where trends are not discussed, either the data are not available in earlier surveys or survey question wording changed from year to year, eliminating the ability to discuss any trend. Furthermore, while every effort has been made to keep key definitions consistent across indicators, readers should always use caution in making comparisons between results from different data sets for several reasons: the data sets may contain definitional differences, such as those used for specific crimes and crimes that occur \"at school,\" and respondent differences, such as examining students who report a victimization (at the individual level) and a school reporting one or more victimizations schoolwide. In addition, readers should always take into account the standard error of an estimate in making comparisons. Because most of the data in this report are from surveys that use a sample of the population, the standard error will inform the reader of the precision of differences between estimates. All the comparisons described in this report are statistically significant at the .05 level."}, {"section_title": "VIOLENT DEA VIOLENT DEA VIOLENT DEA VIOLENT DEA VIOLENT DEATHS THS THS THS THS A A A A AT SCHOOL T SCHOOL T SCHOOL T SCHOOL T SCHOOL VIOLENT DEATHS AT SCHOOL AND AWAY FROM SCHOOL", "text": "In each school year from July 1, 1992, to June 30, 2000, youth ages 5-19 were at least 70 times more likely to be murdered away from school than at school.

In this indicator, a school-associated violent death is a homicide, suicide, legal intervention (involving a law enforcement officer), or unintentional firearm-related death in which the fatal injury occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school in the United States. Deaths that occurred while the victim was on the way to or from regular sessions at school, or while the victim was attending or traveling to or from an official school-sponsored event, were also considered a school-associated violent death. Victims of school-associated violent deaths include students, staff members, and other nonstudents. Data were drawn from a number of data sets to enable comparisons of homicides and suicides at school and away from school. Data for school-associated violent deaths during the 1999-2000 through 2000-01 school years are preliminary. In the most recent school year for which data from all sources are available, from July 1, 1999, to June 30, 2000, there were 32 school-associated violent deaths (table 1.1). Of these violent deaths, 24 were homicides and 8 were suicides. Sixteen of the homicides and 6 of the suicides were of school-aged youth (ages 5-19) at school (figure 1.1 and table 1.1). Combined, this translates into less than 1 homicide or suicide of a school-aged youth at school per million students enrolled during the 1999-2000 school year. 2 Away from school, during roughly the same time period, there were 2,124 homicides and 1,922 suicides of youth ages 5-19. From July 1, 1992, to June 30, 2000, 390 school-associated violent deaths occurred on campuses of U.S. elementary or secondary schools.

When examining students' reports of drinking between 1993 and 2003, no consistent patterns of increase or decrease were found in the percentage of students who had consumed alcohol on school property (between 5 and 6 percent in all survey years). The percentage of students who reported using alcohol anywhere increased from 48 percent in 1993 to 52 percent in 1995 and then declined between 1995 and 2003. The likelihood of drinking alcohol varied by student characteristics. In 2003, males were more likely than females to use alcohol on school property (6 vs. 4 percent), a difference not found in the percentages who reported drinking anywhere (figure 17.1 and table 17.1). In 2003, students in higher grades were more likely to report drinking alcohol anywhere than students in lower grades (figure 17.2 and table 17.1). However, no relationship was found across grade levels for students' reports of drinking alcohol on school property. In 2003, Asian and Black students were less likely to use alcohol anywhere than American Indian, White, or Hispanic students. Twenty-eight percent of Asian students and 37 percent of Black students reported using alcohol anywhere, compared with between 46 and 52 percent of students in the other racial/ethnic groups. On school property, Black and Hispanic students were more likely to use alcohol than White students (6 and 8 percent, respectively, vs. 4 percent).

The NCVS sample consists of about 53,183 households selected using a stratified, multistage cluster design. In the first stage, the primary sampling units (PSUs), consisting of counties or groups of counties, were selected. In the second stage, smaller areas, called Enumeration Districts (EDs), were selected from each sampled PSU. Finally, from selected EDs, clusters of four households, called segments, were selected for interview. At each stage, the selection was done proportionate to population size in order to create a self-weighting sample. The final sample was augmented to account for housing units constructed after the decennial Census. Within each sampled household, U.S. Bureau of the Census personnel interviewed all household members ages 12 and older to determine whether they had been victimized by the measured crimes during the 6 months preceding the interview. The first NCVS interview with a housing unit is conducted in person. Subsequent interviews are conducted by telephone, if possible. About 75,235 persons ages 12 and older are interviewed each 6 months. Households remain in the sample for 3 years and are interviewed seven times at 6-month intervals. The initial interview at each sample unit is used only to bound future interviews to establish a time frame to avoid duplication of crimes uncovered in these subsequent interviews. After their seventh interview, households are replaced by new sample households. The NCVS has consistently obtained a response rate of about 92 percent at the household level. During the study period, the completion rates for persons within households were about 87 percent. Thus, final response rates were about 84 percent. Weights were developed to permit estimates for the total U.S. population 12 years and older.

SAVD seeks to describe the epidemiology of school-associated violent deaths, identify common features of these deaths, estimate the rate of school-associated violent death in the United States, and identify potential risk factors for these deaths. The surveillance system includes descriptive data on all school-associated violent deaths in the United States, including all homicides, suicides, and unintentional firearm-related deaths where the fatal injury occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school, while the victim was on the way to or from regular sessions at such a school, or while attending or on the way to or from an official school-sponsored event. Victims of such events include nonstudents as well as students and staff members. SAVD includes descriptive information about the school, event, victim(s), and offender(s). The SAVD Surveillance System has collected data from July 1, 1992, through June 30, 2002. SAVD uses a four-step process to identify and collect data on school-associated violent deaths. Cases are initially identified through a search of the Lexis/Nexis and Dialog newspaper and media databases. Then police officials are contacted to confirm the details of the case to determine if the event meets the case definition. Once a case is confirmed, a police official and a school official are interviewed regarding details about the school, event, victim(s), and offender(s). If police officials are unwilling or unable to complete the interview, a copy of the full police report is obtained. The information obtained on schools includes school demographics, attendance/absentee rates, suspension/expulsions and mobility, school history of weapon carrying, security measures, violence prevention activities, school response to the event, and school policies about weapon carrying. Event information includes the location of injury, the context of injury (while classes held, during break, etc.), motives for injury, method of injury, and school and community events happening around the time period. Information obtained on victim(s) and offender(s) includes demographics, circumstances of the event (date/time, alcohol or drug use, number of persons involved), types and origins of weapons, criminal history, psychological risk factors, school-related problems, extracurricular activities, and family history, including structure and stressors. "}, {"section_title": "School Crime Supplement (SCS)", "text": "Created as a supplement to the NCVS and codesigned by the National Center for Education Statistics and Bureau of Justice Statistics, the School Crime Supplement (SCS) survey was conducted in 1989,1995,1999,2001, and 2003 to collect additional information about school-related victimizations on a national level. This report includes data from the 1995, 1999, 2001, and 2003 collections. The 1989 data are not included in this report as a result of methodological changes to the NCVS and SCS. The survey was designed to assist policymakers as well as academic researchers and practitioners at the federal, state, and local levels so that they can make informed decisions concerning crime in schools. The SCS asks students a number of key questions about their experiences with and perceptions of crime and violence that occurred inside their school, on school grounds, on a school bus, or on the way to or from school. Additional questions not included in the NCVS were also added to the SCS, such as those concerning preventive measures used by the school, students' participation in after-school activities, students' perceptions of school rules, the presence of weapons and street gangs in school, the presence of hate-related words and graffiti in school, student reports of bullying and reports of rejection at school, and the availability of drugs and alcohol in school, as well as attitudinal questions relating to fear of victimization and avoidance behavior at school. In all SCS survey years, the SCS was conducted for a 6-month period from January-June in all households selected for the NCVS (see discussion above for information about the NCVS sampling design). It should be noted that the initial NCVS interview is included in the SCS data collection. Within these households, the eligible respondents for the SCS were those household members who had attended school at any time during the 6 months preceding the interview, and were enrolled in grades 6-12 in a school that would help them advance toward eventually receiving a high school diploma. The age range of students covered in this report is 12-18 years of age. Eligible respondents were asked the supplemental questions in the SCS only after completing their entire NCVS interview. In 2001, the SCS survey instrument was modified from previous collections in three ways. First, in 1995 and 1999, \"at school\" was defined for respondents as in the school building, on the school grounds, or on a school bus. In 2001, the definition for \"at school\" was changed to mean in the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going to and from school. This change was made to the 2001 questionnaire in order to be consistent with the definition of \"at school\" as it is constructed in the National Crime Victimization Survey and was also used as the definition in 2003. Cognitive interviews conducted by the U.S. Bureau of the Census on the 1999 School Crime Supplement suggested that modifications to the definition of \"at school\" would not have a substantial impact on the estimates. The prevalence of victimization for 1995, 1999, 2001, and 2003 was calculated by using NCVS incident variables appended to the 1995,1999,2001, and 2003 SCS data files. The NCVS type of crime variable was used to classify victimizations of students in the SCS as serious violent, violent, or theft. The NCVS variables asking where the incident happened and what the victim was doing when it happened were used to ascertain whether the incident happened at school. For prevalence of victimization, the NCVS definition of \"at school\" includes in the school building, on school property, or on the way to or from school. Second, the SCS questions pertaining to fear and avoidance changed between the 1999 and 2001 SCS. In 1995 and 1999, students were asked if they avoided places or were fearful because they thought someone would \"attack or harm\" them. In 2001 and 2003, students were asked if they avoided places or were fearful because they thought someone would \"attack or threaten to attack them.\" These changes should be considered when making comparisons between the 1995 and 1999 data and the 2001 and 2003 data. Third, the SCS question pertaining to gangs changed in the 2001 SCS. The introduction and definition of gangs as well as the placement of the item in the questionnaire changed in the 2001 SCS. Because of these changes, the reader should be cautioned not to compare results based on the 2001 and 2003 SCS presented in this report with those estimates of gangs presented in previous reports. Total victimization is a combination of violent victimization and theft. If the student reported an incident of either violent or theft victimization or both, he or she is counted as having experienced \"total\" victimization. Serious violent crimes include rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault. Violent crimes include serious violent crimes and simple assault. A total of 9,728 students participated in the 1995 SCS, 8,398 in 1999, 8,374 in 2001, and 7,152 in 2003. In the 2003 SCS, the household completion rate was 92 percent. In the 1995, 1999, and 2001 SCS, the household completion rates were 95 percent, 94 percent, and 93 percent, respectively; and the student completion rates were 78 percent, 78 percent, and 77 percent, respectively. For the 2003 SCS, the student completion rate was 70 percent. Thus, the overall unweighted SCS response rate (calculated by multiplying the household completion rate by the student completion rate) was 74 percent in 1995, 73 percent in 1999, 72 percent in 2001, and 64 percent in 2003. Response rates for most survey items were high-typically over 95 percent of all eligible respondents. The weights were developed to compensate for differential probabilities of selection and nonresponse. The weighted data permit inferences about the eligible student population who were enrolled in schools in 1995, 1999, 2001, and 2003 National coverage is quite high (about 91 percent of homicides are included in the SHR). However, adjustments can be made to the weights to correct for missing reports. Estimates from the SHR used in this report were generated by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) using a weight developed by BJS that reconciles the counts of SHR homicide victims with those in the UCR for the 1992 through 2001 data years. The weight is the same for all cases for a given year. The weight represents the ratio of the number of homicides reported in the UCR to the number reported in the SHR. For additional information about SHR, contact: WISQARS Fatal provides mortality data related to injury. The mortality data reported in WISQARS Fatal come from death certificate data reported to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Data include causes of death reported by attending physicians, medical examiners, and coroners. It also includes demographic information about decedents reported by funeral directors who obtain that information from family members and other informants. NCHS collects, compiles, verifies, and prepares these data for release to the public. The data provide information about what types of injuries are leading causes of deaths, how common they are, and who they affect. These data are intended for a broad audience-the public, the media, public health practitioners and researchers, and public health officials-to increase their knowledge of injury. WISQARS Fatal mortality reports provide tables of the total numbers of injuryrelated deaths and the death rates per 100,000 U.S. population. The reports list deaths according to cause (mechanism) and intent (manner) of injury by state, race, Hispanic origin, sex, and age groupings. For more information on WISQARS Fatal, contact: the significance level for the tests as a series was at the .05 level. Generally, when multiple statistical comparisons are made, it becomes increasingly likely that an indication of a population difference is erroneous. Even when there is no difference in the population, at an alpha of .05, there is still a 5 percent chance of concluding that an observed t value representing one comparison in the sample is large enough to be statistically significant. As the number of years and thus the number of comparisons increase, so does the risk of making such an erroneous inference. The Bonferroni procedure corrects the significance (or alpha) level for the total number of comparisons made within a particular classification variable. For each classification variable, there are (K*(K-1)/2) possible comparisons (or nonredundant pairwise combinations), where K is the number of categories. The Bonferroni procedure divides the alpha level for a single t test by the number of possible pairwise comparisons in order to produce a new alpha level that is corrected for the fact that multiple contrasts are being made. As a result, the t value for a certain alpha level (e.g., .05) increases, which makes it more difficult to claim that the difference observed is statistically significant. While many descriptive comparisons in this report were tested using t statistic or the F statistic, some comparisons among categories of an ordered variable with three or more levels involved a test for a linear trend across all categories, rather than a series of tests between pairs of categories. In this report, when differences among percentages were examined relative to a variable with ordered categories, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to test for a linear relationship between the two variables. To do this, ANOVA models included orthogonal linear contrasts corresponding to successive levels of the independent variable. The squares of the Taylorized standard errors (that is, standard errors that were calculated by the Taylor series method), the variance between the means, and the unweighted sample sizes were used to partition total sum of squares into within-and between-group sums of squares. These were used to create mean squares for the within-and between-group variance components and their corresponding F statistics, which were then compared with published values of F for a significance level of .05. Significant values of both the overall F and the F associated with the linear contrast term were required as evidence of a linear relationship between the two variables.
