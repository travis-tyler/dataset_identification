We analyzed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) atrophy rate from baseline to 1 year in 4 groups of participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI): AD (n \u03ed 152), converters from MCI to probable AD (MCI-C, n \u03ed 60), stable MCI (MCI-S, n \u03ed 261), and healthy controls (HC, n \u03ed 200). Scans were analyzed using multiple methods, including voxel-based morphometry (VBM), regions of interest (ROIs), and automated parcellation, permitting comparison of annual percent change (APC) in neurodegeneration markers. Effect sizes and the sample required to detect 25% reduction in atrophy rates were calculated. The influence of APOE genotype on APC was also evaluated. AD patients and converters from MCI to probable AD demonstrated high atrophy APCs across regions compared with minimal change in healthy controls. Stable MCI subjects showed intermediate atrophy rates. APOE genotype was associated with APC in key regions. In sum, APC rates are influenced by APOE genotype, imminent MCI to AD conversion, and AD-related neurodegeneration."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common agerelated neurodegenerative disease affecting nearly 25 million people worldwide, a number expected to triple in the next 50 years (Ferri et al., 2005; Wimo et al., 2003) . Patients with AD show significant impairment in multiple cognitive domains, including deficits in memory and executive functioning. Progress in the early clinical diagnosis of AD has led to the characterization of a prodromal syndrome featuring relatively isolated memory deficits termed \"amnestic mild cognitive impairment\" (mild cognitive impairment; MCI) (Petersen and Negash, 2008; Petersen et al., 2001 ). Amnestic MCI is conceptualized as a preliminary stage of AD-associated neurodegeneration with the majority of pa-tients eventually progressing to AD at a rate of 10%-15% per year Petersen, 2000) .\nThe increasing recognition that early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention will be necessary to prevent the development of AD underscores the need to develop sensitive and specific biomarkers for detecting and monitoring MCI and AD. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has shown significant promise as a biomarker to detect early MCI and AD-associated changes, as well as to predict the rate of disease progression Jack et al., 1999; Risacher and Saykin, in press ). Cross-sectional studies evaluating the utility of structural MRI in detecting neurodegeneration have identified significant brain atrophy in patients with MCI and AD, particularly in regions of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) using regional volumetric extraction tools such as manual tracing of regions of interest (ROIs) De Toledo-Morrell et al., 2000; Dickerson et al., 2001; Du et al., 2001; Jack et al., 1992; Killiany et al., 2002; Pennanen et al., 2004; Saykin et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2000) , and more recently, automated segmentation and parcellation of target regions (Becker et al., 2006; Colliot et al., 2008; Du et al., 2007; Fischl and Dale, 2000a; Risacher et al., 2009) . Other semiautomated tools which provide 3-dimensional mapping of brain morphology, including voxel-based morphometry (VBM), tensor-based morphometry (TBM) and related techniques have also identified significant global and local tissue changes in patients with MCI and AD, including decreased whole brain, hippocampal, and temporal lobar gray matter (GM) density (Busatto et al., 2003; Chetelat et al., 2002; Frisoni et al., 2002; Jack et al., 2008b; Karas et al., 2003; Pennanen et al., 2005; Saykin et al., 2006; Trivedi et al., 2006) . Structural MRI techniques have also been shown to provide sensitive prediction of disease progression. Hippocampal volume and GM density, as well as measures of MTL volume and cortical thickness, have been identified as sensitive biomarkers for predicting conversion from MCI to probable AD (Apostolova et al., 2006; Bozzali et al., 2006; Chetelat et al., 2005; Devanand et al., 2007; Jack et al., 1999; Kinkingnehun et al., 2008; Risacher et al., 2009; Visser et al., 2002; Whitwell et al., 2008b) .\nLongitudinal monitoring of rate of decline on MRI measures has also proven sensitive to AD-related changes. Increased rates of whole brain and MTL atrophy in patients with MCI and AD relative to healthy elderly controls (HC) are routinely reported in studies of brain aging and dementia (for recent review, see Frisoni et al., 2010) . Manual tracing or automated ROI techniques and analysis of deformation fields reflecting brain shrinkage are the most commonly employed methods for evaluating longitudinal changes in global and regional volume, particularly in the MTL. Previous studies have reported rates of hippocampal annual decline of 4.5% in patients with AD and 3% in patients with MCI in contrast to 1% decline in controls (for meta-analysis see Barnes et al., 2009 ). Furthermore, increased atrophy rates can also predict future decline, including MCI to probable AD conversion (Erten-Lyons et al., 2006; Jack et al., , 2004 Sluimer et al., 2008; Stoub et al., 2008) , with patients who convert from MCI to probable AD showing higher rates of hippocampal atrophy compared with patients with a stable diagnosis of MCI, reported as 3.5% and 2.2%, respectively (Jack et al., , 2004 .\nGenetic factors play a significant role in the development and progression of MCI and AD. Genetic variation in the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) is the most commonly reported genetic risk factor associated with AD, with the presence of a single 4 allele conferring a 2-fold or 3-fold increased risk of developing AD and 2 4 alleles associated with nearly an 11-fold increased risk (Bertram and Tanzi, 2008; Farrer et al., 1997; Gatz et al., 2006) . In addition to an increased risk of AD, the presence of an 4 allele has been associated with imaging markers. An increased rate of hippocampal and whole brain atrophy in 4 carriers has been reported in nondemented individuals, as well as in MCI and AD patients, in some studies (Cohen et al., 2001; Fjell et al., 2010a; Fleisher et al., 2005; Hamalainen et al., 2008; Jack et al., 2008c Jack et al., , 2008d Mori et al., 2002; Morra et al., 2009; Schuff et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2006) but not in others (Du et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2009) .\nThe Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a 5-year consortium study designed to assess the utility of various biomarkers for detecting early changes associated with MCI and AD and predicting disease course over time, including cross-sectional and longitudinal neuroimaging biomarkers from structural MRI and positron emission tomography (PET), genetic factors, psychometric scores, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers, and other variables. A number of studies utilizing MRI data from this cohort have been published within the last year. Using both ROI and 3-dimensional mapping techniques the expected differences in structural MRI markers have been found between diagnostic (AD, MCI, HC) groups at baseline assessment, including atrophy in hippocampal and other MTL regions and enlarged ventricles in patients with AD and MCI Chupin et al., 2009; Fan et al., 2008; Fennema-Notestine et al., 2009; Nestor et al., 2008; Querbes et al., 2009; Risacher et al., 2009; Vemuri et al., 2009; Walhovd et al., 2008) . Hippocampal volume has also been found to be sensitive and specific for predicting 1-year conversation from MCI to probable AD (Calvini et al., 2009; Chupin et al., 2009; McEvoy et al., 2009; Misra et al., 2009; Nestor et al., 2008; Querbes et al., 2009; . MRI studies of the ADNI cohort have also examined longitudinal change in brain volumes using ROI and whole-brain structural change techniques (e.g., Jacobian determinants, boundary shift integral [BSI]), and have detected differences in annual change in whole brain volume, hippocampal volume, and ventricular volume as a function of baseline diagnostic group (AD, MCI, HC) (Evans et al., 2009; Fjell et al., 2010b; Ho et al., 2009; Holland et al., 2009; Hua et al., 2009; Jack et al., 2009; Leow et al., 2009; McDonald et al., 2009; McEvoy et al., 2009; Misra et al., 2009; Morra et al., 2009; Nestor et al., 2008; Schuff et al., 2009 ) and of APOE 4 genotype (Fjell et al., 2010a; Morra et al., 2009; Nestor et al., 2008; Schuff et al., 2009) . Several studies have reported larger declines in whole brain and regional volumes, as well as larger ventricular volume increases in MCI to AD converters than MCI nonconverters (Evans et al., 2009; Leow et al., 2009; Misra et al., 2009; Nestor et al., 2008) .\nIn order to better evaluate the effectiveness of future disease modifying therapeutics, biomarkers of disease state and progression are likely to be more sensitive and reliable than clinical measures, which may be highly variable within and between participants. When designing clinical trials, an important consideration is the sample size needed to detect a therapeutic effect that is both statistically significant and clinically meaningful in a target biomarker with 80% or 90% power. Several previous studies in the ADNI cohort have calculated the relative sample size needed to detect a hypothetical treatment-induced 25% reduction in brain atrophy for various regional MRI markers and have suggested that to achieve 80% power approximately 35-100 AD and 100 -200 MCI participants are required Holland et al., 2009; Hua et al., 2009; Nestor et al., 2008) .\nDespite the extensive MRI analyses in AD and MCI, prior studies have not directly compared the relative sensitivity of longitudinal changes in GM density and volume, cortical thickness and ROI volumes in relation to changes in clinical status. In ADNI, longitudinal studies have primarily focused on baseline diagnostic groups rather than 1-year clinical conversion status. The present study was designed to compare the annual percent change (APC) of different types of structural MRI markers in groups defined by baseline diagnosis and 1-year MCI to AD conversion status using the final 1-year sample. We hypothesized that patients with more advanced clinical indicators of disease progression, particularly AD and converters from MCI to probable AD (MCI-C), would show significantly greater APC in major structural MRI markers. We also evaluated the relative sensitivity of these markers to progression of atrophy over time. Because of the important implications for design of future therapeutic trials of disease-modifying agents, we also calculated the sample size needed to detect a 25% reduction in atrophy rate for selected markers. We hypothesized that the MTL changes would constitute the most sensitive regional markers of progression and therefore require the smallest potential sample sizes. Prior ADNI reports have not evaluated the sample size needed for trials in rapidly progressing MCI participants (MCI converters; MCI-C) compared with stable MCI participants (MCI-S), an important distinction for trial design. Additionally, previous reports have focused primarily on sample sizes needed for MRI markers that were extracted using a single technique. In the present study, we compared GM density and volume, cortical thickness, and ROI volumetric markers. Finally, we assessed the impact of APOE genotype on APC in several key target regions, which to date has not been examined in patients who converted from MCI to probable AD in the ADNI cohort to our knowledge. We hypothesized that the presence of an 4 allele would increase the annual rate of decline in selected MRI markers of MTL integrity."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ADNI", "text": "ADNI is a consortium study initiated in 2004 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), private pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations.

All available 1.5 T magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) scans collected at the 1-year follow-up visit (\"12-month scans\") were also downloaded for all participants (n \u03ed 693) as of June 2009. A minimum of 2 MP-RAGE images were acquired at each time point for each participant, using a standard MP-RAGE protocol that was selected and tested by ADNI .\nParticipants were only included in the present analysis if their baseline and 12-month MRI scans were successfully preprocessed. Four participants failed Freesurfer processing and were not included in any analyses. Thirty additional participants were excluded from only the VBM analyses due to failed processing of scans from either the baseline or 12-month visit. Participants who did not have either baseline (n \u03ed 2) or 12-month (n \u03ed 124) scans were also excluded. Included participants (n \u03ed 673 for Freesurfer analyses, n \u03ed 643 for VBM analyses) were divided into groups by baseline and 1-year clinical diagnosis and 12-month MCI to probable AD conversion status, resulting in 4 groups: (1) participants with a stable AD diagnosis (AD; n \u03ed 152 for Freesurfer analyses, n \u03ed 143 for VBM analy-ses); (2) participants with an MCI diagnosis at baseline who converted to a diagnosis of probable AD at either the 6-or 12-month time point (MCI-C; n \u03ed 60 for Freesurfer analyses, n \u03ed 57 for VBM analyses); (3) participants with a stable diagnosis of MCI (MCI-S; n \u03ed 261 for Freesurfer analyses, n \u03ed 253 for VBM analyses); and (4) participants with a stable designation of healthy elderly control (HC; n \u03ed 200 for Freesurfer analyses, n \u03ed 190 for VBM analyses).

Participants were classified into groups based on baseline and 12-month diagnoses as reported in the conversion/reversion database.\nTo evaluate the impact of APOE genotype on annual rate of atrophy, we also classified participants by the presence or absence of an APOE 4 allele. Given the unknown impact of having an 24 genotype (i.e., possessing a potential protective allele [2] and a risk allele [4] for AD), we chose to run analyses both including and excluding the 24 participants (n \u03ed 13; 3 AD, 7 MCI-S, 3 HC). We found similar results from the 2 comparisons (data not shown), and thus, chose to use the largest available sample in the results presented in this report.

AD and MCI-C participants show significantly greater APC in hippocampal GM density and hippocampal GM volume relative to MCI-S and HC. The APC in (E) hippocampal volume (n \u03ed 673; 152 AD, 60 MCI-C, 261 MCI-S, 200 HC) extracted using Freesurfer (V4, http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/, Boston, MA) showed a similar trend. AD, Alzheimer's disease; HC, healthy control; MCI-C, converters from mild cognitive impairment to probable AD; MCI-S, mild cognitive impairment-stable. participants. Our main findings were that AD and MCI-C groups had a significantly higher rate of annual decline in global and hippocampal GM density and GM volume, hippocampal total volume, EC thickness, and mean frontal, parietal and temporal lobar GM density, GM volume, and cortical thickness measures than MCI-S and HC participants. Sample size calculations indicated that hippocampal GM density and GM volume required the smallest samples to detect a 25% reduction in rate of regional brain atrophy. Finally, effect size estimates indicated that dynamic measures, including APC in MTL volumes and cortical thickness, showed the most discrimination between MCI-C and MCI-S participants. However, baseline hippocampal volume and GM density, as well as baseline temporal lobe cortical thickness measures, demonstrated the greatest effect size when comparing AD and HC participants. This pattern suggests that structural MRI markers may have differential utility as a function of stage of disease or role within a clinical trial. Whereas hippocampal volume and GM density are powerful tools for assessing baseline neurodegeneration, annual change rate in MTL volumes and cortical thickness may be most useful for comparing stable versus rapidly progressing individuals, and may be the best choice for surrogate markers in trials of disease-modifying agents.\nOur estimates of APC in hippocampal volume, including \u03ea3.95% for AD patients, \u03ea4.10% for MCI-C participants, \u03ea2.65% for MCI-S participants, and \u03ea1.12% for HCs, were similar to estimates from previous reports in the ADNI cohort, as well as other samples (Table 2 ; Barnes et al., 2009 ). These results demonstrate a significantly accelerated rate of brain atrophy in participants diagnosed with AD, as well as those who show rapid clinical decline from MCI to AD. Participants who show stable clinical diagnoses (both MCI and HC) also show relatively stable brain volume and cortical thickness measures, as well as minimal change in psychometric variables (Table 1) .\nWe examined the influence of APOE 4 genotype on annual atrophy rate in selected MTL MRI markers given the mixed prior findings, including significant effects of APOE on brain atrophy in some reports (Jack et al., 2008c (Jack et al., , 2008d , whereas others found no effect (Du et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2009) . In the present study, we observed a modest but significant effect of APOE 4 genotype on annualized hippocampal and EC atrophy rates. This effect was maximal in MCI-S participants, with 4 positive participants demonstrating significantly greater APC in all measures evaluated. However, the effect of APOE genotype in AD and MCI-C groups was only observed on some measures, suggesting a more moderate yet still detectable effect of genotype. Fi- nally, APOE 4 positive HC participants showed an enhanced rate of atrophy relative to 4 negative participants only on hippocampal volume. Our results support the complicated nature of the relationship between APOE genotype and MRI markers of neurodegeneration and suggest that the magnitude of the effect may differ by diagnostic stage, as has been previously reported in the ADNI cohort (Nestor et al., 2008; Schuff et al., 2009) . Future studies will further characterize the impact of APOE, as well as that of variation in other candidate genes, on MRI and other ADNI biomarkers which may assist in elucidating the role of genetic factors in the neuropathology of AD .\nThis report adds to the body of research demonstrating the utility of MRI metrics in detecting and monitoring atrophy associated with AD and MCI, and extends prior research by focusing on identifying differences between rapidly declining MCI to AD converters and individuals with relatively stable MCI. Reports in other smaller samples have led to similar conclusions regarding the utility of MRI extracted measures of global and local brain volume, cortical thickness, and morphometry in detecting and monitoring brain atrophy associated with AD and MCI (Barnes et al., 2007; Cardenas et al., 2003; Erten-Lyons et al., 2006; Fox and Freeborough, 1997; Jack et al., 2000 Jack et al., , 2004 Jack et al., , 2005 Mungas et al., 2005; Sluimer et al., 2008; Stoub et al., 2008; Thompson et al., 2004; Whitwell et al., 2008a) . As previously reported in the ADNI sample, baseline values of hippocampal GM density and volume, amygdalar volume, Fig. 4 . Annual percent change (APC) of mean frontal, parietal, and temporal lobe gray matter (GM) density and volume measures. The APC in mean frontal lobe (A) GM density and (B) GM volume, mean parietal lobe (C) GM density and (D) GM volume, and mean temporal lobe (E) GM density and (F) GM volume are significantly different across groups (n \u03ed 643 [30 participants removed due to failed image processing]; 143 AD, 57 MCI-C, 253 MCI-S, 190 HC. AD, Alzheimer's disease; HC, healthy control; MCI-C, converters from mild cognitive impairment to probable AD; MCI-S, mild cognitive impairment-stable.\nEC thickness, and temporal and parietal lobe cortical thickness measures are significantly different between MCI-C and MCI-S participants . In fact, MCI-C and AD participants show nearly equivalent atrophy at baseline, up to 12 months prior to equivalent clinical diagnoses, indicating that MRI can serve as an antecedent biomarker. Measures of annual decline provide further evidence that MCI to AD converters have characteristic crosssectional and longitudinal brain atrophy more similar to AD patients than to those with stable MCI. The different longitudinal phenotypes warrant investigation and may be useful in examining genetic variation associated with rate of decline (Jack et al., 2008c; Saykin et al., 2009) .\nOur results are generally consistent with previous reports using subsets of the ADNI cohort and alternative methods. Four studies employed Freesurfer-based ROI techniques to estimate APC in selected cortical and subcortical regions and reported similar APC values and differences between diagnostic groups as those observed in the present analysis (Fjell et al., 2010b; Holland et al., 2009; McDonald et al., 2009; McEvoy et al., 2009 ). Furthermore, two of these studies divided the MCI group by baseline Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) and by atrophy pattern (AD-like vs. HC-like; McEvoy et al., 2009 ) and showed variability of APC values within the MCI group, similar to that seen in the present report between MCI-C and MCI-S participants. Two studies used various hippocampal ROIs and reported significantly greater APC in hippocampal volume in AD participants relative to MCI and HC participants (Morra et al., 2009; Schuff et al., 2009) . Two studies examined changes in ventricular volume, demonstrating greater rates of ventricular enlargement in AD and MCI participants relative to HCs, as well as greater ventricular enlargement in participants who converted from MCI to AD within the first 6 months of the study relative to MCI-S participants Nestor et al., 2008) . Three additional studies employed TBM and Jacobian maps to investigate whole brain and temporal lobe atrophy rates and found a similar pattern of differences between participants as seen in the present study Hua et al., 2009; Leow et al., 2009) . One of these studies also reported a higher rate of atrophy in MCI-C relative to MCI-S participants, albeit in a significantly smaller sample (7 MCI-C and 32 MCI-S) than used in the present analysis . Misra et al. (2009) also reported significant differences in atrophy rate between MCI-C and MCI-S participants using a VBM-like technique (RAVENS), although differences were limited to periventricular white matter and the temporal horn (Misra et al., 2009 ). Finally, another study used a boundary shift integral (BSI) technique to evaluate annual rates of whole brain atrophy and ventricular enlargement (Evans et al., 2009 ). This study reported greater annual rates of whole brain atrophy and ventricular enlargement in AD participants relative to MCI and HC participants, as well as in MCI-C relative to MCI-S participants. In fact, Evans et al. (2009) noted that MCI-C participants demonstrated nearly equivalent rates of atrophy as seen in the AD participants, similar to the pattern reported in the present study. Overall, the results of the present study extend this line of research by providing one of the first direct comparisons of annual atrophy rates for an ensemble of state-ofthe-art MRI morphometric, volumetric, and cortical thickness variables in the ADNI cohort, particularly focusing on participants who converted from MCI to AD within the first 12 months of the study. There are several limitations of the present study. First, we were unable to account for some other variables which may have impacted the results. Because the ADNI is an observational study, many participants were taking a number of medications prescribed for AD, MCI, or other conditions that could have affected the results. Additionally, differences in disease severity beyond clinical diagnostic classification (i.e., AD, MCI, HC) was not considered in the present analyses. Although diagnostic classification and conversion status incorporates information from psychometric performance, the present report does not explicitly examine the relationship between changes in MRI variables and changes in psychometric performance. Secondly, the inclusion of only 2 time points separated by approximately 1 year in the present study limited the specificity and accuracy of the APC estimations. One of the major advantages of the ADNI project is the extensive longitudinal data collection. Therefore, as full datasets from the 2-and 3-year time points become available, we plan to expand our analysis of annual atrophy rates in patients with AD, MCI converters, MCI stables, and healthy elderly. Furthermore, we will employ more advanced statistical modeling to compare the atrophy rates between MCI-C participants from several time points. With 3 or more time points nonlinearities can be detected. Finally, this study was limited by the nature of the methods employed to measure atrophy. Specifically, some variability in segmentation and extraction of ROIs is likely, based on the interaction between scan quality or other properties and specific image processing algorithms which may have resulted in variation in the accuracy of the annual change estimates. However, the largely automated methodology employed in these analyses provides for little or no rater bias inherent in manually-directed tools of volume extraction. Furthermore, other analysis techniques (e.g., TBM, BSI) may provide additional and complementary information to that extracted in the present study using VBM and automated parcellation. Although a comprehensive and direct comparison of the relative sensitivity and specificity of target MRI-based atrophy measures extracted using different methods has not been completed to our knowledge, ADNI provides an ideal cohort for investigating this issue. Finally, better methods for visualization and display of longitudinal changes on a voxel-wise basis would also be advantageous. Statistical parametric maps of time by group interactions, like those presented in the present study, do not illustrate the percent change at all significant locations. Development of improved tools for visualization of magnitude of changes as a function of diagnostic group would be useful.\nIn summary, this study used a combination of analysis methods to confirm that MRI-based morphometric markers Table 3 Sample sizes to detect 25% reduction in APC of selected MRI biomarkers detect dynamic changes in rate of atrophy in patients with AD and MCI, compared with controls, and are highly sensitive to the likelihood of clinical progression within 1 year. Measures of GM density change within medial and lateral temporal regions have been employed less than volumetric measures to date but appear particularly promising and complementary to more standard measures such as hippocampal volumetry. The sensitivity of automated and unbiased methods for detecting differences in rate of neurodegenerative changes encourages their use in clinical trials of disease-modifying agents and in prevention trials."}, {"section_title": "Disclosure statement", "text": "Drs.
