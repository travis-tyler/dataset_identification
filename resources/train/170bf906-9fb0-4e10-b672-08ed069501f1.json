As expected, the values of all of the anthropometric, metabolic, serum lipoprotein and marker of insulin resistance variables, except LDL cholesterol levels, were significantly different between the subjects with different MetS scores. Subjects with increasing MetS scores were associated with an increase in age, waist line, BMI, SBP, DBP, TG, apoB, fasting glucose, insulin, and HOMA index. A clear relation was evident between the MetS score and the degree of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. As MetS score increased, so did HOMA index, which is a marker of increased insulin resistance. As the number of components of the MetS rose, the prevalence of hypertension also increased. No difference was noted in the serum levels of LDL cholesterol and the prevalence of current smokers. The prevalence of NCEP Asian modified MetS ( 3 metabolic components) was 41.9% (men: 35.5%, women: 50.8%) in the study group. PP was different between the subjects with and without MetS (without MetS: 42.2 \u00b1 12.0 mmHg vs with MetS: 49.1 \u00b1 14.6 mmHg, p < 0.001). The prevalence of MetS according to age group is shown in Table  2 . 52.3 \u00b1 16.9 mmHg, p < 0.001 by one-way ANOVA analysis). When the subjects were divided into 5 groups according to age and MetS score, PP showed a progressive increase as the MetS score increased within each age group (Fig. 2) . The slope of the elevation showed steep increase in the patients over the age of 50. Also, the HOMA index demonstrated a pattern of increase according to increasing PP in each age groups as well (Fig. 3) . After adjustment for age and hypertension, insulin resistance, which was measured by HOMA index, was also correlated with PP (correlation coefficient = 0.074, p < 0.01). We investigated whether increased MetS scores were independently associated with an increase in PP. Linear regression was performed using the variables significant in bivariate analysis as the candidate variables and PP as a dependent variable, and we found associations of MetS score with PP while controlling for classical cardiovascular risk factors (smoking, age, gender, LDL-C).

"}, {"section_title": "MetS and increasing arterial stiffness", "text": "MetS is recognized as a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors that frequently coincides with insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. Previous studies showed that obesity and the presence of MetS are associated with increasing arterial stiffness. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Moreover, the independent association between vascular structure with function and each component of MetS has previously been reported. 8 In the present study, regression analysis revealed that an increase of MetS score was proportionately related to an increase in PP, demonstrating that increasing component of MetS is a determinant of increasing PP, irrespective of age. Because traditional risk factors of cardiovascular disease are known to be associated with increasing degree of arteriosclerosis, the clustering of risk factors in patients with MetS may be one of the important factors for the elevation in arterial stiffness and subsequent increase in PP. [14] [15] [16] However, the effect of MetS is more than the sum of its parts, with each components acting synergistically in the development of cardiovascular disesase. 17, 18 In a cross sectional analysis of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), the clustering of components of MetS exerted a synergistic effect on vascular stiffness that was more than the effect of individual components of MetS. 8 MetS is associated with an increase in sympathetic and neurohormonal activation, endothelial dysfunction and increasing degree of insulin resistance which may act in concert to increase arterial stiffness and PP. 5, 19, 20 Vascular inflammation is also an important determinant of increasing arterial stiffness with an increase in serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) that is associated with increase in pulse wave velocity. 21 Inflammation plays a key role in the development of complications in metabolic syndrome, and hsCRP is known to be significantly correlated with each component of metabolic syndrome as well as degree of insulin resistance. [22] [23] [24] Therefore, an increasing degree of vascular inflammation may be important in increasing arterial stiffness and PP in patients with MetS."}, {"section_title": "Mechanisms of correlations between insulin resistance and arterial stiffness", "text": "An interesting finding from this study is the progressive increase in insulin resistance that is associated with increase in PP. This finding was Although the mechanism underlying this association is not clearly defined, insulin resistance state is associated with decreased endothelial dependent arterial compliance. 25 Also, insulin is known to diminish wave reflection the effect of which is blunted in obese, insulin resistance state, 26 and regression analysis which\nHOMA index in the equation demonstrated that insulin resistance is independently associated with increase in PP. (Table 3 , model 2) However, the addition of HOMA index to the regression model resulted in weak contribution of insulin resistance to pulse pressure with an increase of R 2 from 0.206 to 0.207 (Table 3) . Therefore, the clustering of components of MetS that exerts a synergistic effect on vascular stiffness may be more important in increasing pulse pressure than insulin resistance itself.\nThe prevalence of MetS in this study population was relatively high due to the fact that the study population consisted of a high proportion of patients with a history of cardiovascular disease and hypertension. Also, many patients consented to enroll at the cardiovascular genome center due to health concerns. Therefore, the prevalence of MetS in our data does not reflect that of the general population. Furthermore, blood pressure and PP in this study were relatively low, and the reason appeared to be that many of the patients in the study group were being administered with antihypertensive medications. Nevertheless, this would not diminish the clinical impact of this study since PP is a significant predictor for cardiovascular risk in treated hypertensive patients as well. 27 "}]
