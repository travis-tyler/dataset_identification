In recent years, some researchers have tried to apply neural network (NN) to classify AD patients from healthy controls (HC) based on functional MRI (fMRI) data. But most study focus on a single NN and the classification accuracy was not high.

The progress of AD increases with age and the disease easily triggers the other psychiatric diseases, and eventually causing dementia. In 2006, the number of AD patients is 26.6 million all around the world and the number would be quadruple by 2050. Therefore, it is meaningful for clinician to track its progression and diagnose the disease. Currently, there have been many different neuroimaging techniques which can be applied to diagnose AD, such as ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG) (Engels et al., 2015) , Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) (Prosser et al., 2015) , Positron Emission Tomography (PET) (Pagani et al., 2017) , Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) (Engels et al., 2016) , and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (Griffanti et al., 2015) . Among these techniques, fMRI is widely used in the diagnosis of AD, because it adopts a non-invasive way and could be used to find the differences of brain regions between AD and healthy controls (HC) (Challis et al., 2015) .\nMachine learning is a method of pattern recognition and has been used for the study of AD in recent years (Moradi et al., 2015; Khazaee et al., 2016) . Among many machine learning methods, artificial neural network (ANN) is a useful classification method which evolves from human brain (Er et al., 2016) . Several previous studies showed that neural network (NN) was able to be applied to diagnose neurological disease. Suk et al. (2016) proposed a method that combined deep learning and state-space model to classify Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients from HC, and the accuracy was 72.58%. Gao et al. (2017) employed an advanced convolution neural network (CNN) with 2D and 3D to diagnose AD, and the average accuracy reached to 87.6%. Ortiz et al. (2016) used deep learning architectures to classify AD patients from HC, and the accuracy approximately reached to 90%. Ortiz et al. (2013) used Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) algorithm to classify AD patients from HC, and the accuracy was close to 90%. Luo et al. (2017) applied CNN to classify AD patients from HC, and the sensitivity and specificity of classification was 1 and 0.93 respectively. Suk et al. (2014) used deep learning to classify AD patients from HC, and the accuracy was close to 93.35%.\nIn existing studies, a single NN is often used to classify patients with neurological diseases and HC, and the accuracy of classification is considerable which indicates that NN is a powerful classification model (Hirschauer et al., 2015; Anthimopoulos et al., 2016) . As the features of neuroimaging data are characterized by high dimension, significant information of original variables would be lost in the process of dimensionality reduction in traditional methods such as principal component analysis, local linear embedding and linear discriminate analysis (Mattioni and Jurs, 2003; McKeown et al., 2007; Mannfolk et al., 2010) . In this paper, the method of the random neural network cluster is proposed to classify AD from HC. This method not only could be used in the classification, but also could be used for feature selection. The procedure of this method is as follows. Firstly, we chose Elman NN as the optimal base classifier from five types of neural networks [Back Propagation (BP) NN, Elman NN, PNN, Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) NN and Competitive NN] based on the results of feature selection, and the accuracies of the random Elman neural network cluster could reach to 92.31% which is the highest and stable. Then we used the random Elman neural network cluster to select significant features and these features could be used to find out the abnormal regions. Finally, we found out 23 abnormal regions, such as the precentral gyrus, the frontal gyrus and supplementary motor area.

All ADNI subjects together with their legal representatives should have written informed consent before collecting clinical, genetic and imaging data. The following two criteria need to meet when selecting data. One criterion is that the selected data should be resting-state fMRI data. Another criterion is that the selected data should have mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and clinical dementia rating (CDR) scores, and this criterion ensures that the selected data is homologous. Finally, 61 subjects were selected which consisted of 25 AD patients and 36 HC."}, {"section_title": "Data Collection and Preprocessing", "text": "Scanning images were acquired on a Philips Medical Systems 3 Tesla MRI scanner.

The data was preprocessed based on the Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI (DPARSF) software (Chao-Gan and Yu-Feng, 2010; Wang et al., 2013) . The process of the data preprocessing included: converting DICOM format into NIFTI format; removing first 10 time points; slicing timing (Sarraf et al., 2016) ; realigning (Jenkinson et al., 2002) ; normalizating images into the echo planar imaging (EPI) template (Misaki et al., 2010) ; temporal smoothing; removing the effect of low-level (<0.01 HZ) and high-level (>0.08 HZ) noise by a high-pass temporal filtering (Challis et al., 2015) ; removing covariates such as the whole brain signal and cerebrospinal fluid signal."}, {"section_title": "Functional Connectivity of Brain", "text": "After the preprocessing steps, the analysis of the functional connectivity of brain was followed. In this paper, we chose functional connectivity as the sample feature. The extraction of the functional connectivity is as follows.

Thirdly, the Pearson correlation coefficient between two separated brain regions could be defined as the functional connectivity (Friston et al., 1993) . Finally, 4,005 (90 \u00d7 89/2) functional connectivity of each subject were taken as their features."}, {"section_title": "The Random Neural Network Cluster", "text": "The 4,005 functional connectivity belongs to the highdimensional feature which causes the problems of computation difficulty and dimensions of disaster. Moreover, the highdimensional features are likely to result in numerous redundant and irrelevant features which may decrease the classification performance. Therefore, the irrelevant features are needed to be removed by feature selection (Azar and Hassanien, 2015) .\nThere are many methods of feature selection, such as principal component analysis, local linear embedding and linear discriminate analysis. However, in these methods, the process of selecting features may cause the loss of the original information, and the classification performance may be unsatisfactory (Zhou et al., 2015; Jolliffe and Cadima, 2016; Alam and Kwon, 2017) .\nTo solve the problem above, this paper proposes the random neural network cluster by randomly selecting samples and features. The random neural network cluster could be used to classify AD patients from HC and select features. In addition, the new method could achieve the purpose of reducing dimensionality, avoid losing significant information and improve classification performance."}, {"section_title": "The Design and Classification Accuracy of the Random Neural Network Cluster", "text": "The basic thought of the random neural network cluster is ensemble learning whose basic classifier is neural network. The detailed process of establishing the random neural network cluster is as follows. Firstly, the sample dataset D is randomly divided into a training set N 1 and a test set N 2 , where D = N 1 + N 2 . The real label of HC and AD is +1 and \u22121 respectively. Secondly, we randomly select n samples from the training set and m features from the 4,005 features. Thirdly, the selected samples and features are used to establish a single NN and the process of the second and third step is repeated for k times. Thus, k NNs are obtained which construct the random neural network cluster. It can be seen from this process that the method and the conventional process are essentially not the same in essence. Figure 1 shows the formation of the random neural network cluster.\nWhen a new sample enters the random neural network cluster, we could obtain k class labels from k NNs and the majority of class label is made as the predicted label of the new sample. Similarly, we could get the label of each sample in the test set N 2 . Then the predicted label is compared with the real label to judge whether they are consistent, and we assume C as the number of consistent situations. The accuracy of the random neural network cluster equals to C/N 2 ."}, {"section_title": "Extracting Features From the Random Neural Network Cluster", "text": "As the features are randomly selected, the NNs constructed by these features have different characteristics. In this paper, the accuracy of each NN is used to evaluate the significance of selected features. The features that make significant contributions to the accuracy of the NN are called the \"significant features\". The process of extracting significant features is as follows.\nFirstly, the test samples are used to obtain the accuracy of each NN in the random neural network cluster. If the accuracy of a NN is high, the corresponding features are significant. Next, the features in each NN with high accuracy are extracted to form a feature matrix. Finally, we count the frequency of each feature in the feature matrix, and extract the features with high frequency which are called as \"significant features.\" Figure 2 shows the process of selecting \"significant features.\" The significant features tremendously contribute to the accuracy of a NN, thus they also make great contributions to the accuracy of the random neural network cluster.

In this paper, the significant features are regarded as the abnormal functional connectivity. As the functional connectivity is defined as the relationship of two brain regions, the extracted significant features could be used to find the abnormal brain regions between AD and HC. In order to estimate the abnormal degree of a brain region, the number of features related to a certain region is considered as the weight. When there is no functional connectivity related to a certain brain region, the weight of the region is 0. When the weight is greater, the abnormal degree of the brain region is higher.\nThe first 180 features constitute the optimal feature set which is used to find the abnormal brain regions between AD patients and HC. Table 3 shows the abnormal brain regions with higher weight, their abbreviation and volume.

Building the random neural network cluster. Firstly, 61 subjects are divided into a training set and a test set according to the proportion of 8:2. Thus, the number of training samples and test samples is 48 and 13 respectively. Then, 45 subjects are randomly selected from 48 training samples and 120 features are randomly selected from 4,005 features to build a NN. Similarly, we build 1,000 NNs to construct the random neural network cluster. The result of the random neural network cluster is calculated by using neural network toolbox.\nStep 2. Selecting significant NNs. We select the NNs whose accuracy is >0.6 from the 1,000 NNs and call these NNs as significant NNs.\nStep 3. Selecting significant features. The features corresponding to the significant NNs form the feature matrix. Then we count the frequency of each feature, and sort the features with a descending order. Finally, we retain the first 240 features which are regarded as the original significant features.\nStep 4. Determining the optimal number of the significant features. We change the number of original significant features from 140 to 240 features with a step of 10 as the new significant features, thus there are 11 types of numbers of new significant features. Then we select 120 features from the new significant features to construct a NN. We select 120 features from the original significant features, and change the number of significant features from 140 to 240 features with a step of 10. Thus, we could obtain 11 random neural network clusters. The number of the significant features corresponding to the random neural network cluster with highest accuracy is the optimal number.\nStep 5. We repeat the step1-step 4 by using five types of NNs. They are BP NN, Elman NN, PNN, LVQ NN, and Competitive NN. Then we choose one of them as the best base classifier who has the highest accuracy in step 4.\nStep 6. Finding abnormal brain regions through the significant features in step 4 based on the best base classifier."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The Demographic Information of Participants", "text": "In this study, the selected 61 subjects include 25 AD patients and 36 HC. The gender and age difference between the AD group and HC group data are examined by two-sample t-test and chi-square test respectively. The result is shown in Table 1 . It is referred that the two groups have no statistical significance in the gender and the age."}, {"section_title": "Classification Results", "text": "In this study, five different types of NNs are applied to construct five different types of random neural network clusters. The number of significant features in each random neural network cluster changes from 140 to 240 and the step is 10. Therefore, we can obtain 11 results for each type of random neural network cluster, and their parameters have been made appropriate adjustments to get better results. The accuracies of five types of random neural network clusters are shown in Figure 3 . It is referred that the accuracies of random Competitive neural network cluster are not stable; the accuracies of random Elman neural network cluster and random Probabilistic neural network cluster are high, and their highest accuracy reaches to 92.31%; the accuracies of random BP neural network cluster and random LVQ neural network cluster are lower than the random Elman neural network cluster. The accuracies of the random neural network cluster changes when the number of features changes.\nAs the highest accuracies of the random Elman neural network cluster are relatively stable and high, this paper chooses Elman neural network as the best base classifier. From Figure 3 we can learn that when the number of significant features is 180, the accuracy is the highest. Therefore, 180 is the optimal number of significant features. In order to better compare the performances of the random neural network cluster and a single NN, we display the corresponding 1,000 NNs' accuracies of five types of random neural network clusters in the Figure 4. From Figures 3, 4 we could learn that the accuracy of random neural network cluster is higher and more stable than a single NN except for the random Competitive neural network cluster. In addition, we also show the training errors, test errors and running time of five types of random neural network clusters in Table 2 ."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION Classification Performance", "text": "A number of researchers have tried to classify and diagnose AD patients from HC in the past few years. For instance, Khazaee et al. (2016) applied machine learning methods to classify MCI patients, AD patients and HC, and the accuracy of AD and HC is 72%. Kim et al. (2016) applied DNN to classify schizophrenia (SZ) patients and HC based on fMRI image, and the accuracy is 85.8%. Zhang et al. (2014) proposed a kernel support vector machine decision tree (kSVM-DT) to classify MCI patients, AD patients and HC based on the MRI data, and the accuracy of AD and HC is 96%. However, there were several disadvantages in these studies. For instance, as the features of neuroimaging data are characterized by high dimension, significant information of original variables would be lost in the process of dimensionality reduction in traditional methods. In this paper, the new method was proposed to avoid the loss of information and improve classification performance. We used five different types of NNs as the base classifier to build five different types of random neural network clusters. In the five types of random neural network clusters, the classification accuracies of the random Elman neural network cluster and the random PNN cluster could reach to 92.3%. As the resting-state fMRI data dynamically changes in a period of time and the Elman NN is able to deal with the time and spatial domain data, the Elman NN is more suitable for the fMRI data. The accuracies of the random Probabilistic neural network cluster could also reach to 92.3%, but the running time of the PNN is long which makes it not suitable for the base classifier of the random neural network cluster. Thus, we finally choose the random Elman neural network cluster as the best base classifier. To solve the problems caused by the high-dimensional data, the traditional methods suffer from the loss of some information in the process of reducing dimensionality. In this paper, we proposed a random neural network cluster which could be a good solution in dealing with the calculation of large samples and high-dimensional data. Moreover, the highest accuracies of the random Elman neural network cluster could reach to 92.3%. Therefore, this method could process high-dimensional data without information loss and improve classification performance.\nThe basic classifier used in this paper is the neural network. This classifier is indeed an existing classifier, and it is not the innovation point of this paper. The innovation of this article is the integrated cluster, which is the innovation in structure.\nThis paper researches on fMRI image, there is no innovation in the classification indicators of this article. But the classification indicators have been used in research. We used the random neural network cluster to classify the subjects and feature selection, and we got good results. That is the innovation in application."}, {"section_title": "The Additional Details of the Random Neural Network Cluster", "text": "In the part of method, we have introduced many elementary details in our method and in this part we would introduce some additional details.\nIn order to make the random neural network cluster less complex, each NN occupies the same weight in the random neural network cluster. When determining the label of a new sample, each NN in the random neural network cluster predicts the label of the sample. The majority of class label is made as the predicted label of the sample which is equivalent to that the weight of each NN is the same . From Figures 3, 4 we could learn that the accuracy of a single NN is lower than the accuracy of the random neural network cluster. Moreover, when the number of significant features changes, the accuracies of five types of random neural network clusters are high and stable except for the random Competitive neural network cluster. This fully demonstrates that the robustness of the random neural network cluster is good. In terms of the complexity of random neural network cluster, it is mainly reflected in the following two aspects. One aspect is that the number of base classifiers is large which makes the process of constructing a random neural network cluster complex. Another aspect is that we need to construct multiple random neural network clusters during finding the optimal feature set which also makes the method complex.\nThere are two types of parameters in our method. One type is the parameters of the random neural network cluster which are decided by the accuracy of the random neural network cluster through hundreds of experiments. Another type is the parameters of the NN which are decided by the neural network toolbox that automatically selects the optimal parameters.\nThe random neural network cluster is constructed by the training set and the performance is tested by the test set. The experimental results show that the random neural network cluster not only performs well on the training set, but also performs well on the test set.
