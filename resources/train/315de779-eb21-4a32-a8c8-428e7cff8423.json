[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) research is beginning to focus on earlier stages of disease, prior to formal diagnosis of AD dementia. Th is focus on early symptomatic disease and populations with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) introduces issues of heterogeneity since patients at these earlier stages have not yet met the more standardizing criteria of an AD diagnosis. Understanding this heterogeneity is the fi rst step in eff ectively planning studies for these early populations.\nOne of the barriers to understanding the heterogeneity in these early populations is the diffi culty in isolating cognitive domains for measurement. Most neuropsychological (NP) tests require a number of cognitive processes and, therefore, measures of multiple domains. In the previous issue of Alzheimer 's Research & Th erapy, Tatsuoka and colleagues [1] get around this problem by identifying the multiplicity of cognitive domains measured by each NP test and also the level of ability in that domain that is required for maximum performance on the test. Th ey use this information in a Bayesian statistical model that is designed to separate out the eff ects of diff erent cognitive functions on the NP outcomes. Based on NP data collected in MCI subjects in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study, the approach yielded several potential combinations of cutoff s for baseline NP test scores and apolipoprotein E (APOE) status values which predict imminent risk of progression to AD over the course of a 24-month period.\nImportantly, the authors also illustrate that more commonly applied methods, such as factor analysis and logistic regression, are not able to achieve the same level of success in predicting a diagnosis of AD, presumably because the specifi c domains are not able to be separated with those models. Separation of specifi c domains also allows grouping of the specifi c combinations of defi cits into diagnostic subgroups (for example, amnestic singledomain MCI, amnestic multidomain MCI, and nonamnestic multidomain MCI) which then can be analyzed in terms of biomarkers and disease outcomes.\nTh e ultimate validation of the method awaits replication in larger, more diverse MCI populations, as the authors acknowledge, although the method appears promising. Many diff erent statistical approaches are currently being applied to clinical outcomes in order to identify patients who will progress to AD or patients who will have diff erent decline rates over time. Th e results from these analyses can be used to help us identify a particular population and then a sensitive clinical outcome for study in a clinical trial that will result in improved power for detecting a diff erence.
