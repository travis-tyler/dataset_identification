[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "In recent times, accurate and early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) plays a vital role in patient care and further treatment. Predicting AD from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitive normal (CN) has become popular. Neuroimaging and computer-aided diagnosis techniques are used for classification of AD by physicians in the early stage. Most of the previous machine learning techniques work on handpicked features. In the recent days, deep learning has been applied for many medical image applications. Existing deep learning systems work on raw magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images and cortical surface as an input to the convolution neural network (CNN) to perform classification of AD. AD affects the brain volume and changes the gray matter texture. In our work, we used 1820 T2-weighted brain magnetic resonance volumes including 635 AD MRIs, 548 MCI MRIs, and 637 CN MRIs, sliced into 18,017 voxels. We proposed an approach to extract the gray matter from brain voxels and perform the classification using the CNN. A Gaussian filter is used to enhance the voxels, and skull stripping algorithm is used to remove the irrelevant tissues from enhanced voxels. Then, those voxels are segmented by hybrid enhanced independent component analysis. Segmented gray matter is used as an input to the CNN. We performed clinical valuation using our proposed approach and achieved 90.47% accuracy, 86.66% of recall, and 92.59% precision."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive dementia, which causes a loss of connection between nerve cells in elders. Owing to AD, the brain shrinks, hippocampal size decreases, and the brain ventricles enlarge. As AD progresses, it debases memory, thinking ability, and the person's expressions to the problem in day-to-day activities. Understanding AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitive normal (CN) manifestation is one of the most challenging tasks faced by neurologists from the past few years. Physicians are using different clinical methodologies to perform classification of AD. Clinically, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration deals with AD. The level of norepinephrine increases in the CSF as the disease progresses. The CSF is collected using a ventricular puncture; the physician makes a hole in the skull and collects the CSF directly from one of the brain ventricles [1] . It is a laborious procedure, and it may have a risk of bleeding in the brain. With the development of medical imaging techniques, neuroimaging plays a major role in the diagnosis of structural and functional changes in the brain and encompasses computer tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography, functional MRI, and single-photon emission CT. MRI is used to analyze structural changes caused by AD, CN, and MCI manifestation because of its ease of accessibility. The most common MRI sequences are T1-weighted and T2weighted scans. T2-weighted scans are used in this work. Neuroimaging techniques help visualize the anatomical changes in the brain. In Fig. 1 , change in the hippocampal size and enlargement of ventricles are observed in the MRI image AD brain having cortical atrophy compared with the MRI image of CN brain and MCI brain.\nIt is evident that the texture of the brain changes as the disease progresses from CN to MCI to AD. Shape transformation in the brain is used as a morphological signature of the brain structure. Morphological changes in the brain texture, structure, and volume are used to classify the healthy brain from a diseased brain [2, 3] . AD is caused by degeneration of brain cells and changes in the brain volume. The early effect of AD is observed based on changes in the hippocampus, the size of which is used to classify the AD stage [4] . Change in the white matter (WM) is estimated to analyze the area of the brain affected due to AD [5] . The gray matter (GM) is used to analyze AD [6] . AD is classified using the volume of interest [7] . Image volume has more number of voxels and high dimensionality. The huge information is reduced via wavelet transformation where the classification is carried out in a voxel-by-voxel manner instead of classifying the entire data [8] ; selecting an appropriate voxel and relevant area will result in good specificity and sensitivity [9] ; voxel-based features are used to classify AD stages [10] ."}, {"section_title": "Related work", "text": "Since the last few years, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is used to assist and give a second opinion to the physicians. Many researchers are developing different CAD systems to diagnose AD. Most physicians use physical tests and the Mini-Mental State Examination [2, 11] to verify the stage of AD. Clinically AD classification is performed by collecting different parameters and by developing biomarkers to test the AD stage. A 5-stage route map was developed for CSF-based diagnosis of preclinical AD using Ab ratios rather than Ab42 [12] . Recent CAD systems use machine learning as a computational technique to analyze patterns of medical data. Different machine learning approaches such as regression, classification, and clustering are used in the CAD system. Machine learning approach gives better classification accuracy based on the features that are extracted from the images; to detect the structural and textural changes in the brain MRI, single modalities and multimodalities are used as features [13] . Brain volume, shape, voxel intensity, CSF measurement, and genetic information are used as features to perform the classification of AD, using random forest [14] ; those features are correlated using PCA, the dimensionality of the features is reduced, and they are classified using sup-port vector machine (SVM) and particle swarm optimization [14, 15] . As AD progresses, it affects brain tissues such as the WM, GM, and hippocampus. The WM and GM are segmented from brain MRI using learning vector quantization, an unsupervised approach, and classification was performed using SVM. Texture changes in the WM and GM are used to differentiate AD from MCI and CN; texture changes are measured using first-order statistical parameters that are extracted from the histogram, and then the second-order statistical features are extracted from GLCM and Gabor filters [16] -these features are used to differentiate AD from CN using KNN [16] and SVM [17] classifiers. Hybrid features generated by combining texture and volume information, such as texture features along with GM volume, are used to perform the classification of AD using SVM-random Fourier expression (SVM-RFE) [18] . Hybrid features extracted from segmented brain image and clinical data are used for multiclass classification of AD from MCI and CN [19] . As the features are more, the classification accuracy increases, but it makes accurate training of a classifier more complicated; greedy score is used to select the important features, and kernel-based discriminative method is used to perform feature selection of complex features [20] . Hippocampal volume is used to differentiate AD and MCI [21] . Hippocampal volume is verified patchwise [22] ; patch-based image features are selected by professional and medical experts with knowledge in medical segmentation. Texture features are extracted patchwise using Gabor filter, and classification is performed using a weak classifier [23] . In all the aforementioned approaches, features are extracted manually, and it requires expert knowledge in selecting the features.\nIn recent years, deep learning framework has achieved greater success in many fields. An artificial neural network has more influence on the development of deep learning architecture. There are many machine learning approaches adopted to perform classification of medical images using CAD. The advantage of neural networks is that the CAD system used in recent days [24] . In deep convolutional neural networks, hierarchical layers are connected and have the advantage over artificial neural networks. Deep learning achieves good performance in medical image analysis [25] . Deep radiomic features are extracted from the threedimensional MRI image using entropy convolution neural network (CNN) to perform AD classification [26] . Multimodal three-dimensional CNN is used to extract the features and perform AD classification [27] . Features from stacked autoencoders and low-level features in combination help to build the classification model [28] . Extracting texture from the center slices of the MRI image and using those as input for performing AD classification using bootstrap algorithm as the region of interest is used to collect the features from MRI [29] . Transfer learning using the VGG-16 pretrain model is used to perform the classification of AD-NC-MCI [30] . Hippocampal volume patches are used to perform the classification using the hybrid classifier CNN and recurrent neural network [22] .\nIn this article, we propose a CNN classifier for automatic classification of AD from MCI and CN using GM.\nWe evaluated the architecture performance using T2weighted MR images collected from a standardized data set, Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The contribution of the article is summarized as follows: Fig to remove the unwanted tissues from the voxels. b) We specifically used GM for atrophy detection. In this article, GM tissues are segmented using hybrid enhanced independent component analysis (ICA). c) CNN architecture is trained using segmented GM voxels. d) The trained CNN is evaluated using independent MRI voxels collected from a local MRI center and correlated with clinical information, which achieves remarkable accuracy.\nThe aim of this work is to develop a computer-based diagnosis system that provides additional support for the medical staff to support their diagnosis evidence."}, {"section_title": "Materials", "text": "In our work, a total of 1820 MRI images are obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

Structural and texturual changes in the brain are used to differentiate healthy and diseased tissues, and enhanced ICA is used to perform segmentation of the brain into the WM, GM, and CSF. Brain tissue atrophy is used to detect AD stage. AD is a progressive disease, in which the brain experiences changes in GM and WM texture and volume, as well as expansion of ventricles. In our work, we classify the AD based on GM atrophy. We used CNN as a classifier which is used in different computer vision techniques, since the past couple of years. Our classification approach has 3 major sections: (1) preprocessing; (2) train, test, and validation of the classifier; and (3) perform clinical valuation-as shown in Fig. 2 ."}, {"section_title": "Preprocessing", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Skull stripping algorithm", "text": "Skull stripping is the most important preprocessing technique. For accurate classification of images, unwanted and nonbrain tissues are initially removed from the voxels and the brain tissues are left. The proposed skull stripping algorithm has a sequence of steps. Before applying skull stripping, the image is enhanced using a Gaussian filter, and detailed information and noise are reduced.\nThe enhanced voxels are convolved by a 3 ! 3 filter as given in equation (1).\nThe filtered image is segmented into brain and nonbrain tissues using thresholding technique; selection of threshold value is crucial to generate the initial binary image. Morphological operation is performed on the binary image to remove the unwanted regions. Active contour is applied on the binary image to separate foreground from background and generate a final binary mask. On multiplying the final binary mask with the original voxel, the skull is stripped and unwanted tissues such as skull, scalp, dura, eyes, and so forth are removed from the voxel. The skull stripping algorithm steps are as follows.

In our work, we have used hybrid enhanced ICA. K-means and expected maximization (EM) are combined to form a hybrid strategy to cluster the brain tissues in the MRI. This combination achieves the capability of providing clusters for welldistributed image pixels and compactness through EM.\nIn our proposed hybrid enhanced ICA, the concept of mixture model is introduced and it is characterized into mutually exclusive classes. In the modified GMM approach, spatial information is added to GMM using Markov random field (MRF) and takes spatial dependency into account. In EM, the expected step is computed using log likelihood with mean and variance calculated using modified K-means and latent variable calculated through Gibbs density function. The aforementioned parameters are used as input parameters to hybrid enhanced ICA to perform the segmentation of the brain MRI voxels.
