[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The recent impacts of tropical cyclones and severe storms on the U.S. Atlantic coast brought into focus the need for extended records of storm activity from different geomorphologic settings. Such reconstructions are typically developed from sites that experienced repeated overwash of sand into low-energy, depositional environments. However, salt-marsh sediment may also preserve a record of repeated erosion from tropical cyclones and storms. We describe late Holocene sediments beneath the Sea Breeze salt marsh (Delaware Bay, New Jersey) from more than 200 gouge cores positioned along seven transects. The stratigraphic record documents at least seven depositional sequences consisting of salt-marsh peat and mud couplets that represent dramatic changes in sedimentation regime. There are a number of processes that could produce these stratigraphic sequences against a background of rising relative sea level including: lateral migration of tidal creeks; tidal channel network and/or drainage ditch expansion; changes in sediment delivery rates; rapid relative sea-level change; tsunami; and formation of salt pans. The abrupt contacts between the salt-marsh peat and overlying intertidal mud suggest that erosion of the peat was followed by rapid infilling of accommodation space. Correlation of erosional surfaces across 2.5 km suggests a common mechanism and we propose that the erosion was caused by tropical cyclones and/or storms. We developed a chronology of repeated salt-marsh erosion and recovery using 137 Cs, metal pollution (Pb concentration and stable isotopes), and radiocarbon data. Two recent episodes of salt-marsh erosion may correlate with historic tropical cyclones in AD 1903, and AD 1821/1788 that impacted the Atlantic coast of New Jersey, but the erosive nature of the Sea Breeze site hinders definitive correlation. Prehistoric erosional sequences correlate with overwash fans preserved in the regional sedimentary record. We estimated that it takes from several decades to almost 200 years for salt-marshes to recover from storm erosion."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The U.S. Atlantic coast is at risk from landfalling tropical cyclones and storms that cause economic, social, and environmental devastation. Significant uncertainty surrounds projected tropical cyclone activity in response to climate change (e.g. Emanuel et al., 2008; Knutson et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2012; Holland and Bruyere, 2013) . Instrumental and observational records are too short to adequately describe trends in tropical cyclone activity particularly for the largest and rarest events (Elsner, 2007; Landsea, 2007; Liu, 2007) . Paleotempestology seeks to reconstruct and explain the spatial and temporal variability in frequency and intensity of landfalling tropical cyclones and severe storms during past centuries and millennia.\nTropical cyclone deposits are most commonly recognized as anomalous sand layers deposited by storm surges in low-energy environments such as back-barrier marshes, lakes, and lagoons where \"normal\" conditions between tropical cyclones are characterized by deposition of organic and fine-grained sediments (e.g. Liu and Fearn, 1993; Donnelly et al., 2001a Donnelly et al., , 2001b Woodruff et al., 2008; Madsen et al., 2009; Williams and Flanagan, 2009 ). The character of these storm-surge deposits varies by locality depending upon the source of sediment, flow characteristics and duration of the storm surge, and local topography (e.g. Morgan et al., 1958; Cahoon, 2006; Sallenger et al., 2006; Hawkes and Horton, 2012) . On coastlines characterized by barrier island geomorphologies such as the U.S. mid-Atlantic, storm surges of sufficient height overtop barrier islands and redistribute sediment from the beach and shore front to the back barrier where it is deposited as a washover fan, often on top of a salt-marsh. Studies of back-barrier sediments in southern New Jersey revealed that the timing of washover fans preserved in the sedimentary record was consistent with deposition during intense historical tropical cyclones and storms in AD 1938 , AD 1944 , AD 1950 , and AD 1962 (Donnelly et al., 2001b Donnelly and Webb III, 2004) . Additional overwash deposits were likely deposited by similar tropical cyclones or storms that made landfall in AD 1821 (Donnelly et al., 2001b) , AD 550 to 1400, and AD 500 to 600 (Donnelly et al., 2001b; Donnelly and Webb III, 2004) . Although the identification of tropical cyclone deposits in coastal lakes and salt-marshes is usually based on the recognition of sand units and/or microfossil evidence, organic geochemical signatures such as C/N, \u03b4 13 C and \u03b4 15 N provide a complementary approach (Lambert et al., 2008) .\nThe sedimentary record beneath salt marshes may also preserve an erosive signature of tropical cyclones and storms. For example, stratigraphic and radiocarbon data from a Connecticut salt marsh showed widespread erosion events at 1400 to 1440 AD and prior to 1640 to 1670 AD (van de Plassche et al., 2004; van de Plassche et al., 2006) . Each time the erosion was followed by rapid and complete infilling of the accommodation space created by erosion with a regressive relative sea level (RSL) sequence of tidal mud overlain by low-marsh and then high salt-marsh peat as the salt marsh recovered (Fig. 1 ). The erosive events in Connecticut occurred at the same time as deposition of overwash fans~60 km away in Rhode Island (Donnelly et al., 2001a) . Van de Plassche et al. (2006) concluded that the most likely cause of this sedimentary pattern was the erosive action of a storm surge.\nWe reconstruct a history of erosional events impacting the northern shore of Delaware Bay in the last~2000 years by applying the approach of van de Plassche et al. (2006) . Detailed litho-, bio-and chronostratigraphic investigation of a salt marsh at Sea Breeze, New Jersey, identifies at least seven episodes of substantial erosion followed by rapid sediment accumulation and salt-marsh recovery. After considering a wide range of potential mechanism of salt-marsh erosion, from micro-scale tidal creek migration to macro-scale events such as tsunami, we propose that the erosion was caused by storm surges. This study aids the building of regional databases of past tropical cyclones and/or severe storms that are necessary for comprehensive spatial and time-series analyses and illustrates the influence of storm surges on tidal salt-marshes."}, {"section_title": "Study area", "text": "Sea Breeze is located in New Jersey on the northern shore of the Delaware Bay ( Fig. 2A ) and experienced RSL rise throughout the Holocene (Miller et al., 2009; Engelhart and Horton, 2012; Horton et al., 2013) . During the last~2000 years (prior to AD 1900), RSL rose at a rate of~1.3 mm/yr, primarily because of glacial isostatic adjustment (Engelhart et al., 2011) . This continuous RSL rise created accommodation space that was infilled by estuarine sediments, preserving a detailed record of RSL change and coastal processes during the Holocene. The tidal regime in this region is semidiurnal and the great diurnal range (mean lower low water, MLLW, to mean higher high water, MHHW) at the nearest NOAA tide gauge is 1.78 m (Reedy Point; Fig. 2A ). Finegrained, minerogenic sediments transported by the Delaware River are trapped in the estuary and distributed to the salt marshes by tides (Sommerfield and Wong, 2011) . Salt marshes on the Delaware Bay (like most on the U.S. Atlantic coast) are highly organic and include little sand, with silt being the most dominant size fraction of clastic material (Nikitina et al., 2003) .\nThe Sea Breeze salt-marsh is a~2 km wide platform, dissected by tidal channels and underlain by 2-4 m of salt-marsh and tidal-flat sediments (Fig. 2B) . A small group of houses existed on the seaward edge of the marsh from the late 19th century before being abandoned in AD 2010. A seawall was built in AD 2007 to protect the houses from storm erosion, but was damaged the same year and is no longer repaired.\nNo other engineering structures were in place prior to AD 2007. The modern salt-marsh is subdivided into four, vertically-aligned subenvironments reflecting the varied tolerance of plants to the frequency Under a regime of rising relative sea level, the salt marsh accumulates sediment to preserve its elevation in the tidal frame. (C) The action of a storm surge erodes and removes a portion of the previously undisturbed sedimentary record. The now exposed surface is located at a lower elevation with respect to sea level. (D-E) The newly created accommodation space is rapidly infilled, first by intertidal mud and then by low-marsh and high-marsh peat as sediment accumulation raises the elevation of the surface in the tidal frame. The resulting sediment is a regressive sequence of relative sea level change. The erosive surface represents a hiatus in the sedimentary record that can be identified by a sharp contact between sedimentary units and a temporal gap in accumulation. and duration of inundation by salt or brackish water. Tidal-flat environments between MLLW and mean tide level (MTL) are not colonized by vascular plants and are characterized by gray mud. Low salt-marsh environments along the banks of tidal channels correspond to elevations between approximately MTL and mean high water (MHW) and are colonized by tall form of Spartina alterniflora. Most of the modern marsh platform is vegetated by Spartina patens, Distichlis spicata, and the stunted form of Spartina alterniflora. This high salt-marsh community typically exists between MHW and MHHW (McKee and Patrick, 1988; Oertel and Woo, 1994) . Phragmites australis and Iva frutescens occupy the elevated banks (levees) of tidal creeks and the borders between salt marshes and freshwater uplands at elevations above MHHW. Meadows of Schoenoplectus spp. are also found at the boundary between upland salt marshes and freshwater uplands and represent brackish, waterlogged conditions (Tiner, 1985; Stuckey and Gould, 2000) . Macrofossils of plant species from each of the vegetated subenvironments are commonly recognizable in buried sediments and aid reconstruction of tidal flat and salt-marsh facies."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Core recovery and sampling", "text": "The sediment beneath the Sea Breeze salt marsh was described from more than 200 hand-driven gouge cores positioned along seven transects (Fig. 2B ). Cores were recovered in 1-meter segments with 2.5-cm-wide Eijkelkamp gouge cores. Multiple cores with a 5 to 15 m radius were taken at many sites to confirm the stratigraphy. Sediment sequences were described using the Tr\u00f6els- Smith (1955) scheme. The sediment type, color, texture, organic content, the presence of identifiable plant macrofossils, and the character of transitions between lithologic units were described in the field. Selected core sections were photographed at the time of collection to document abrupt changes in lithology ( Fig. 3A , B, C). We developed a detailed lithostratigraphy from all cores to document sediment accumulation patterns and reconstruct paleoenvironmental changes ( Fig. 4 ). We identified plant macrofossils preserved in core material by comparing roots, rhizomes and plant stems with modern examples of the same species and field guides (Niering et al., 1977; Tiner, 1985) . Core locations were recorded using GPS and the surface elevation of each core was measured using a 1988 (NAVD88). Representative cores for laboratory analysis and dating were recovered in 0.5 m sections using a 5 cm-wide Russian-type hand auger to minimize compaction and contamination from upper sections during coring. The cores were sealed in plastic wrap and refrigerated. One core (63, located on transect I-I\u2032) was sampled at a resolution of 10 cm to ensure that all stratigraphic units were adequately represented. Grain-size and loss-on-ignition (LOI) analyses refined and supported the lithology described in the field. Grain size distribution was measured using a Beckman Coulter laser particle-size analyzer following the sediment preparation procedures of Pilarczyk et al. (2012) . Grain size classifications followed the Wentworth scale. Organic content was determined by LOI following the procedures of Ball (1964) ."}, {"section_title": "Radiocarbon dating", "text": "We sampled identifiable plant macrofossils from six cores (30, 32, 56, 59, 62, and 63) salt-marsh surface, corms (short, vertical, underground plant stems) preserved in growth position were picked from the sediment cores to ensure the accuracy of dating of paleo-salt-marsh surfaces. Samples were cleaned under a microscope to remove contaminating materials, such as adhered sediment or invasive younger roots, and dried at 50\u00b0C. Radiocarbon ages were calibrated using CALIB v6.1.0. (Stuiver and Reimer, 1993) and the IntCal09 calibration data set (Reimer et al., 2011) . We report original radiocarbon ages and calibrated years AD/BC with 2\u03c3 calibrated uncertainty for 14 radiocarbon dates (Table 1) . The ages constrain when changes in sedimentary environment took place, provide a means to verify correlation of regressive sequences among cores, confirm the presence of erosive hiatuses, and estimate the time necessary for salt-marsh recovery after erosion. The maximum age of erosion was estimated by radiocarbon dating corms of alterniflora found beneath the upper contact of the mud unit that overlies the high-marsh peat (Fig. 1F ). The minimum age of high salt-marsh recovery was estimated by radiocarbon dating corms of patens and Schoenoplectus americanus from the contact between the low-marsh and high-marsh peat (Fig. 1E )."}, {"section_title": "Identifying chronological markers", "text": "Use of radiocarbon to date macrofossils from the last~400 years is hindered by a plateau in the calibration curve resulting in multiple ages and large uncertainty. To address this limitation we identified chronostratigraphic pollution markers of 137 Cs activity, Pb concentrations, and stable Pb isotopes in bulk sediment to constrain recent depositional histories. Three, 80 cm long, cores (24, 30, and 56) were recovered and sampled at 2 cm intervals, dried and ground to homogenized powder. For measurement of 137 Cs activity, samples were sealed in 60 ml plastic jars and stored for at least 30 days to ensure radioactive equilibrium between Ra and Bi, and then counted for at least 24 h on Canberra Model 2020 low-energy germanium detectors. Measurements of 137 Cs (t 1/2 = 30.1 years) activity were made by gamma spectrometry. Peak 137 Cs activity occurred in AD 1963 as a result of above-ground testing of nuclear weapons. Activity of 137 Cs was measured in cores 24, 30, and 56. In each case the AD 1963 peak occurs within a single stratigraphic unit and without a step change suggesting that identification of peak 137 Cs activity is not distorted by erosion ( Fig. 5 ).\nConcentration and isotope ratio determinations for Pb in core 63 were made using a quadrupole ICP-MS instrument (Agilent 7500c) with a conventional glass concentric nebulizer. The long-term, 2\u03c3 precision for the BCR-2 reference material (total Pb concentration of 11 mg/kg) used for quality control was 207:206 Pb = 0.0008, and 208:206 Pb = 0.0020, based on n = 32 replicates over 29 months and a mean accuracy, relative to the published values of Baker et al. (2004) , within that error. Processing consisted of: (i) removal of background; (ii) calculation of isotope ratios; (iii) determination of mass bias correction factor from defined isotope ratios of SRM981; (iv) application of mass bias factors derived from SRM981 using external standardsample-standard bracketing; and (v) optional further correction for linearity of ratio with signal strength.\nWe assumed that the Pb inventory of the Sea Breeze salt marsh was deposited primarily from atmospheric deposition rather than from local upstream sources (Graney et al., 1995; Lima et al., 2005) . Because residence time of Pb pollutants in the atmosphere is several years and emission values per unit of production and consumption likely changed through time, chronological markers were recognized by trends rather than absolute values. Downcore trends in Pb represent historical Pb emissions from industrial centers, changes in national production and consumption, and the introduction and subsequent phasing out of leaded gasoline. This approach is reliant upon the implicit assumption that measured downcore trends represent a full and complete history of atmospheric deposition. In the case of Sea Breeze where multiple erosive events are a key part of the stratigraphic record, this assumption is invalid and interpretations of downcore pollution profiles must be made with appropriate caution. Our interpretation of downcore changes is based on that presented by Kemp et al. (2012) for a saltmarsh in central New Jersey that experienced continuous sediment accumulation during the last~200 years. While Sea Breeze experienced High-marsh recovery accumulation punctuated by episodes of erosion, it is possible to identify some chronological marker horizons based on stratigraphic position and downcore trends that occur within a single sedimentary sequence (i.e. where trends are not inferred across erosive boundaries). Early Pb production in the United States was centered on the Upper Mississippi Valley (UMV) where Pb ores have a distinctive isotopic signature allowing its identification in sediments by measuring changes in the ratio of 206 Pb to 207 Pb (Lima et al., 2005; Gobeil et al., 2013) . UMV Pb is characterized by a higher 206 Pb to 207 Pb ratio than other ores exploited in the United States or imported from overseas for domestic consumption. Emissions during this early period of Pb production (AD 1827-1880) were unchecked, allowing a relatively small amount of Pb production to leave a large isotopic signature. Prevailing winds carried Pb to New Jersey (Kemp et al., 2012) , New England (Lima et al., 2005) , 1.19 1.20 1.21 1.22 1.23 1.24 1.25 1.1921.1941.1961.1981.2001.2021.2041.206 enlarged in panel D Canada (Gobeil et al., 2013) , and Bermuda (Kelly et al., 2009) . Historical records show that Pb production in the UMV began in AD 1827, peaked in AD 1857, and had declined to a small relative and absolute amount by AD 1880. In Sea Breeze core 56, the record of Pb deposition from the UMV is captured entirely in the intertidal mud and high salt-marsh peat of sequence 6 between erosive contacts (Fig. 6) . Therefore, our identification of the start, peak, and decline of UMV Pb production is not distorted by a downcore profile spanning an erosive contact and is further supported by the absence of step changes in 206 Pb: 207 Pb in the measured profile that would indicate erosion. Since~AD 1930, changes in 206 Pb: 207 Pb reflect the introduction, phasing out, and changing mixture of leaded gasoline. The post AD 1930 interval is preserved in core 56 above the erosive contact at the base of sequence 7 (Fig. 6 ) and we identified horizons at AD 1965 and AD 1980. Downcore changes in Pb concentration identified sediment horizons that correspond to historical changes in U.S. production and consumption. The onset of national Pb production (and pollution) began in AD 1875 and reached a peak around AD 1925 before declining during the Great Depression between AD 1930, and AD 1933. A second peak in Pb production and consumption occurred in AD 1974 followed by a decrease due to the phasing out of leaded gasoline (Nriagu, 1998; Kelly et al., 2009) . In core 56, the maximum measured Pb concentration occurs close to the middle of the intertidal mud in sequence 7 (Fig. 6 ). It was, therefore, possible to recognize the AD 1925, AD 1935, and AD 1974 pollution marker horizons because these are preserved in a single sedimentary unit and this interpretation does not span an erosive boundary as demonstrated by the complete increase to a clear peak and subsequent decline. We were unable to identify the AD 1875 onset of Pb pollution because it was likely removed by the erosive event marking the base of sequence 7. This interpretation is also supported by the step change in Pb and Sb concentrations at approximately 0.70 m depth. The position of the AD 1925 peak in Pb concentration and decline out of UMV Pb suggest that the erosive contact at the base of sequence 7 removed approximately 20-40 years of from the sedimentary record preserved in core 56."}, {"section_title": "Loss-on-Ignition (%)", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Stratigraphy of Sea Breeze", "text": "We recognized six lithostratigraphic units in the sediment underlying the Sea Breeze salt marsh (Fig. 5) . The depositional environment represented by each unit was determined from organic content and recognizable plant macro-fossils. Grain size analysis of Core 63 indicated a low percentage of sand (~b15%) in the late Holocene stratigraphy above the basal sand with negligible changes in clay and silt distributions between units. These six units and associated erosive boundaries were correlated across the site from core logs (Fig. 4) :\na) The Sea Breeze salt marsh is uniformly underlain by pre-Holocene fluvial deposits of gray, fineto medium-sized sand. b) The sand is overlain by a black, humic, sandy mud that we interpret as a paleosol. c) A dark brown to black basal peat with fragments of Schoenoplectus spp., is found in the majority of cores on transects I-I\u2032 and II-II\u2032 at elevations below \u2212 2.5 m NAVD88 (Fig. 4) . This peat was likely deposited in a brackish environment at the transition between the salt marsh and freshwater upland; similar to the modern transitional environment at Sea Breeze. Dated fragments of Schoenoplectus spp. in core 32 indicate that brackish tidal marshes began to develop at Sea Breeze around 290 BC \u00b1 40 years (Table 1) . d) A gray-brown, fibrous peat overlies the paleosol and brackish saltmarsh deposits. The presence of S. patens and D. spicata macrofossils within this peat indicates that it accumulated in a high salt-marsh environment between MHW and MHHW. e) A gray mud described at different stratigraphic levels above the high salt-marsh peat units represents tidal-flat and low salt-marsh depositional environments. Vertical stems of S. alterniflora deposited above tidal mud illustrate colonization by low salt-marsh vegetation. f) A gray-brown muddy peat with abundant S. alterniflora fragments was likely deposited in a low salt-marsh environment.\nFollowing deposition of the lowermost high salt-marsh peat, the stratigraphy at Sea Breeze shows at least seven repeated sequences (numbered 1 to 8, from oldest to youngest) of high salt-marsh peat overlain by gray mud with little (10-15%) organic matter, representing tidal-flat deposits, which recovers to a low salt-marsh and then to high saltmarsh environment (Fig. 1) . The contacts between the high salt-mash peat and overlying mud are sharp (b 1 mm), suggesting an abrupt change in the sedimentation regime and environment of deposition (Fig. 3A, B) . Sequence 1. A brackish/high salt-marsh peat is abruptly overlain by \u00e3 10 cm thick gray tidal-flat mud. The upper contact of the mud occurs at~\u2212 2.5 m NAVD 88 (~3.5 m below modern salt-marsh surface) (Figs. 3B, 4) . Correspondingly LOI decreases in Core 63 from 68% within the peat to 15% within the mud (Fig. 5) . The mud unit is overlain by gray-brown, low salt-marsh muddy peat. Rhizomes of S. alterniflora recovered immediately below the transition between mud and low salt-marsh, muddy peat in core 63 indicate that the tidal flat was colonized by salt-marsh vegetation between AD 260 and AD 520. The low saltmarsh peat is capped by high salt-marsh peat that accumulated at the elevation of -2.25 m NAVD 88 by AD 429 to AD 567, based on a dated fragment of Schoenoplectus spp. (core 59; Transect III). Sequence 1 was complete along transects I, II, and III (Fig. 4) . Sequence 2. The high salt-marsh peat from sequence 1 is abruptly overlain by a 10 to 60 cm thick tidal-flat mud. The peat has an organic content of up to 53% where as the mud is as low as 8%. The upper contact of the mud was documented at the elevation of \u2212 2.0 m NAVD 88 (Figs. 3B, 4) . The mud was capped by a low salt-marsh peat. A S. alterniflora rhizome in core 63 yielded a maximum age of AD 776 to AD 966 for the recolonization of the tidal-flat surface by low salt-marsh plants. The age of a S. alterniflora stem found in the overlying high salt-marsh peat in core 62 indicates that high salt-marsh vegetation had recolonized by AD 890 to AD 1030 at an elevation of -1.8 m NAVD 88. Sequence 2 was complete along the north-west portion of Transect I (cores 62-78), and at selected sites along II (cores 81, 13, 69, and 66) and III (core 72). Sequence 3. The high salt-marsh from sequence 2 is overlain by a 10 cm to 40 cm thick tidal-flat mud. In Core 63 the LOI rapidly decreases from 47% in the peat to 10% in the mud. This mud unit occurs between \u2212 1.6 m and \u2212 2.0 m NAVD 88. In transects I, II, and III, the mud unit unconformably overlies mud or low salt-marsh peat of sequence 2. Salt-marsh recovery and recolonization of the site by low salt-marsh plants occurred from AD 900 to AD 1150, as indicated by the first appearance of S. alterniflora vegetation in the low salt-marsh peat above the mud in cores 32, 56 and 63. A radiocarbon date from core 30 shows a recovery to a high salt-marsh environment by AD 893 to AD 1012. High salt-marsh peat accumulation began at the elevation of~\u2212 1.5 m NAVD 88. Sequence 3 is found in nearly all cores on transects I, II and III. It was also documented in transect VI. Sequence 4. A tidal-flat mud (10 to 60 cm thick) abruptly overlies the high salt-marsh peat of sequence 3. Although, not as abrupt as in sequences 1, 2 and 3, the LOI does change from 35% in the peat to 12% in the mud in Core 63 (Fig. 5) . The upper contact of mud was documented at~\u22121.05 m NAVD 88. In transects I to IV the abrupt boundary of the mud unconformably extends into the mud unit of sequence 3. The dated S. alterniflora stem (core 63) and rhizome (core 59) indicate that a community of low salt-marsh plants recolonized by AD 1319 to AD 1610 ( Fig. 5) . A high salt-marsh plant community had recolonized by AD 1451 to AD 1632 (core 63) at the elevation of~\u2212 0.8 m NAVD 88. Sequence 4 is found in all transects except V. Sequence 5. The high salt-marsh peat from sequence 4 is overlain by tidal-flat mud of varying thickness (20 cm to 1.0 m). In Core 63, the high salt-marsh organic content is relatively low (30-27%), but there is an abrupt decrease in LOI across the erosive contact to the mud (7%). Though the mud lower contact was documented in more than 20 cores and appeared to be sharp (Fig. 3A) , its bottom boundary unconformably overlaps the mud of sequence 4 in transects I, II, IV and VI. The upper contact of mud occurs at~\u2212 0.5 m NAVD 88. There is no date available to estimate when low salt-marsh plants recolonized the tidal-flat surface. A high salt-marsh plant community had replaced low salt-marsh vegetation in sequence 5 by AD 1665 to AD 1814 (core 30). Sequence 5 was documented in all transects. However, its occurrence is limited to one or two core sites located next to each other and therefore, its lateral extent is limited to~50 m except in transects IV and VII where it was correlated across~150 m. The shape and thickness of mud unit, unconformities and lateral discontinuity are similar to stratigraphy of infilled paleo-channels. Sequence 6. The high salt-marsh peat of sequence 5 or 4 is overlain b\u1ef9 20 cm of tidal-flat mud. The upper boundary of the mud occurs at 0 m NAVD 88. In Core 63, there is a notable decrease in organic content from the peat (50%) to the overlying mud (12-10%), although the change begins 10 cm below the erosive contact. The age of salt-marsh recovery was estimated using trends in measured 206 Pb: 207 Pb ratios in core 56 (Fig. 6C) . The shift toward higher 206 Pb: 207 Pb ratios marks the onset of Pb production in the Upper Mississippi Valley in AD 1827. Therefore we can only infer that erosion at the base of sequence 6 occurred prior to this date. Peak and declining 206 Pb: 207 Pb ratios show that high salt-marsh peat accumulation began prior to AD 1857 and continued to at least AD 1880. The complete sequence 6 was documented in all transects except for transects III and VI where a change in deposition from high salt-marsh peat to low salt-marsh muddy peat at the elevation of 0 to \u2212 0.2 m NAVD 88 may represent an incomplete sequence 6 (cores 73, 72, 59 and 116, transect III and cores 86, 98 and 110, Transect VI). In transect I there was only partial core recovery between cores 27 and 46a (Fig. 4) . Sequence 7. The high salt-marsh peat in sequences 6, 5, or 4 is overlain by 10 to 40 cm of tidal-flat mud (Fig. 3C) . However, there is no change in LOI across the contact of Core 63 (Fig. 5) . The upper boundary of the mud unit is at~0.5 m NAVD88. The timing of mud deposition was cautiously estimated using chronological horizons recognized by downcore changes in Pb concentrations, trends in the ratio of stable Pb isotopes, and 137 Cs activity in Core 56 (Figs. 6, 7) . Deposition of the mud unit began prior to AD 1925 and finished after AD 1974, when a low salt-marsh plant community colonized the mud flat. However, 137 Cs activity in cores 24, 30, and 56 indicates that low salt-marsh conditions had reestablished by AD 1963. The use of chronological marker horizons to constraint depositional histories at Sea Breeze is complicated by erosion. Chronological discrepancies between methods and cores may reflect an incomplete inventory of atmospheric deposition that distorts trends. Additionally abrupt changes between high salt-marsh and tidal-flat environments may invalidate the assumption that deposition is primarily from atmospheric sources. The low salt-marsh peat is commonly capped by modern high salt-marsh, but at some locations on transects III, IV, V, VI and VII, modern low salt-marsh peat or tidal-flat mud was deposited on top of the sequence at the elevation of~0.7 m NAVD 88. Sequence 7 is present in all transects. Sequence 8. High salt-marsh peat or tidal-flat mud of sequence 7 is overlain by 10 to 20 cm mud unit with an upper boundary at~0.7 m NAVD 88. The mud is overlain by low saltmarsh muddy peat. Based on the depth of maximum 137 Cs activity in cores 24, 30 and 56, salt-marsh plants revegetated the mud after AD 1963. Sequence 8 is present in nine cores in transects III, IV, V and VII. The modern saltmarsh vegetation at these core sites is tall and short from S. alterniflora with S. patens. Sequence 8 is not present in Core 63 (Fig. 5) .\nThe time between first appearance of S. alterniflora on the tidal flat and recolonization of low salt-marsh surface with S. patens and D. spicata represents the period of time needed for salt-marsh recovery following an abrupt change in sedimentation. Based on available data for sequences 7, 4, 3 and 2 we estimated that it takes between 20 and 194 years for salt marshes to recover from erosion events where large expanses of a single salt marsh are disturbed."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Proposed mechanism of salt-marsh erosion", "text": "At Sea Breeze, we identified at least seven sequences of peat and mud couplets that have abrupt contacts suggesting erosion and a dramatic change in sedimentation regime. There are a number of processes that could produce these stratigraphic sequences against a background of rising RSL including (but not limited to): lateral migration of tidal creeks (e.g. Stumpf, 1983) ; tidal channel network and/or drainage ditch expansion (e.g. D' Alpaos et al., 2007) ; changes in sediment delivery rates (e.g. Kirwan et al., 2011; Mudd, 2011) ; rapid relative sea-level change (e.g. Atwater, 1987; Long et al., 2006) ; tsunami (Dawson, 1994; Tuttle et al., 2004) ; formation of salt pans (e.g. Wilson et al., 2009) ; or erosion during storm events and rapid infilling of the newly created accommodation space (e.g. van de Plassche et al., 2004; van de Plassche et al., 2006) .\nSalt-marsh tidal creeks are believed to be static features that show little lateral channel migration due to extensive vegetation root structure that supports their banks (Redfield, 1972; Garofalo, 1980; Gabet, 1998) . However, mechanisms that cause the destruction of above and below-ground vegetation, such as deposition of dead vegetation on creek banks and subsequent development of bare banks or wave erosion may lead to bank face erosion and lateral migration, or enlargement of tidal channels (Stumpf, 1983; Philipp, 2005; Lottig and Fox, 2007; Chen et al., 2012; Deegan et al., 2012) . These slow processes produce regressive stratigraphic sequences with localized channel-shaped mud facies overlain by peat (Allen, 2000; Nikitina et al., 2003) . Based on the facies geometry, only sequence 5 could have been formed by infilling of incised paleo-channels.\nAn extensive network of mosquito control ditches was created on the Sea Breeze salt marsh between AD 1887 and 1930 (Philipp, 2005) . This anthropogenic modification of the landscape almost certainly changed the marsh hydrology and sediment delivery rates over an extensive area of the study site. By AD 1963 most of the ditches had naturally filled by sedimentation, but in some cases segments of multiple ditches became connected and evolved into the network of more permanent tidal channels prior to AD 1981 (Fig. 8C, D) . Ditching of salt marshes was widespread in New Jersey during the early part of the 20th century. Therefore a high proportion of potential study sites in the region have a history of modification similar to Sea Breeze. If human modification of the landscape was the primary mechanism for explaining the stratigraphy observed in sequences 7 and 8 it would be reasonable to expect to see similar patterns at other salt marshes in the region. However, the Sea Breeze stratigraphy is unusual (although likely not unique) and the erosive pattern we documented is not present at other salt marshes that we investigated or that have been described in published literature (e.g., Psuty, 1986; Donnelly et al., 2001b; Donnelly et al., 2004; Miller et al., 2009 ) suggesting that ditching is unlikely to be the causal mechanism for sequences 7 and 8, but cannot be discounted.\nProcesses that change RSL rapidly on the scale of a single salt marsh include sediment compaction, tidal-range change and, large earthquakes that cause vertical displacement of the land on tectonicallyactive coasts. T\u00f6rnqvist et al. (2008) suggested that compaction of Holocene strata contributes significantly to the exceptionally high rates of RSL rise and coastal wetland loss in the Mississippi Delta. In southeastern England, Long et al. (2006) suggested that an originally planar peat surface was locally lowered in the tidal frame by sediment compaction and subsequently overlain by tidal-flat mud. In these studies the stratigraphy differs from Sea Breeze, because only one late Holocene transgressive sequence was identified, where the contact (and process) was gradual and the overlying mud sequence was several meters thick. Hall et al. (2013) showed that tidal range in Delaware Bay increased steadily during the late Holocene and, thus, would not be responsible for the sedimentary sequences described at Sea Breeze. Steady increase in tidal range should not result in repeated abrupt changes in sedimentation pattern. Instead, it should produce one mud unit with gradual time-transgressive contact. However, during the 20th century tidal range in the upper estuary rapidly increased two-fold because of dredging and wetland modification in the mid-upper estuary that began in AD 1910 (DiLorenzo et al., 1993 . Historical maps and aerial photos of Sea Breeze show that at least two channels were dredged after AD 1930 and suggest that sediment accumulation on salt-marsh surface was modified by human activities (Fig. 8C) . Systematic deepening of the tidal channels would cause a positive feedback of increased tidal discharges, further channel erosion, and increase in suspended sediment concentrations compensated for by sediment accumulation on tidal flats and salt marshes (Fredericks, 1995) . In response, the salt-marsh surface would either accumulate sediment to maintain a stable tidal elevation and support the characteristic plant community, or experience increasing frequency and duration of tidal flooding resulting in marsh drowning (Orson et al., 1998; Morris et al., 2002) . Therefore, dredging may have been responsible for the deposition of the mud in the recent sequences 7 or 8, and possibly both if there were two distinct dredging phases and its subsequent colonization by salt-marsh vegetation, but is not be a plausible causal mechanism for sequences 1 to 6.\nWhile it is difficult to distinguish between the sedimentary signature of tsunami and storm erosion in the salt-marsh sediments (Engel and Br\u00fcchner, 2001) , it is unlikely that tsunamis produced multiple erosional contacts at Sea Breeze. There have been only few tsunamigenic earthquakes documented along the Atlantic coast of North America (Smith, 1966; Bakun and Hopper, 2004) . But in 1817, a Mw 7 earthquake occurred offshore of South Carolina, and may have been responsible for a reported~30 cm sea-level rise on the Delaware River (Hough et al., 2013) . Hough et al. (2013) tsunami simulations model predicted that 50-cm tsunami runups at the mouth of Delaware Bay would require an earthquake of M-7.5 and greater with estimated surface slip of 3 m and~60 km long rupture along the fault oriented such that a tsunami wave moves directly into the Bay.\nThe stratigraphic record from Plum Island estuary in Massachusetts reported by Kirwan et al. (2011) is similar to the one at Sea Breeze, with the exception that only one sequence consisting of a mud unit overlain by low and high salt-marsh peat was recorded. Kirwan et al. (2011) suggested that the Plum Island stratigraphy records infilling of the estuary and lateral progradation of the salt-marsh due to increased sediment delivery associated with European settlement and land clearance that mobilized sediment, which ultimately was transported to the coast and deposited in estuaries. Priestas et al. (2012) , however, argued that the salt-marsh stratigraphic sequence at Plum Island predates European settlement and is a consequence of salt-marsh expansion rather than loss. Humans have modified the Delaware Bay watershed for over 400 years (Philipp, 2005) and regional land clearance could be responsible for one of the sequences from the historic period (i.e., 6, 7, or 8) .\nWhile the more recent changes in salt-marsh sedimentology may be related to land-use change and human modification of the salt-marshes, this is not a plausible mechanism for the sequences that were created prior to human settlement. The uniform depth of the upper contacts between mud and low-marsh peat correlated (in most cases, over 2.5 km) suggests a common cause for the erosion. Similarly, the gradual change between the low and high salt-marsh sedimentation documented at the top of each sequence indicates synchronous marsh recovery. There are two possible explanations: salt pan development and/or storm surge erosion.\nSalt pans are shallow, water-filled depressions that are common on salt marshes along the Atlantic coast of North America (e.g. Redfield, 1972; Turner et al., 1997; Adamowicz and Roman, 2005) . Some salt pans form on tidal flats and later become surrounded by salt-marsh vegetation, while others form as result of vegetation disturbance on the salt-marsh surface (Wilson et al., 2009) . The stratigraphic signature of salt pans often consists of dark-gray mud overlain by low salt-marsh peat and is therefore similar to the regressive sequences described at Sea Breeze. If the stratigraphic record is conformable then the unit underlying the salt pan sequence represents the high salt-marsh environment where the pool originally formed. The bottom contact of such sequences may be erosional as a result of geochemical (sulfate reduction) rather than physical processes (van Huissteden and van de Plassche, 1998) . Salt pans are usually of limited extent and effect only relatively small parts of the modern salt-marsh at any given time causing salt-marsh fragmentation rather than synchronous, site-wide changes (Boston, 1983; Day et al., 2000) . The stratigraphic signature of salt pan expansion and infill would therefore be discrete rather than laterally continuous mud units (Wilson et al., 2009 ). However, remotesensing in coastal Louisiana documented formation of geomorphological features resembling salt pans after the landfall of tropical storms (Morton and Barras, 2011) . These storm-impacted salt-marsh features vary in size from closely spaced small scours (plucked salt-marshes) to 10 3 m long orthogonal-elongated ponds, or amorphous pans up to 1500 m across (Barras, 2007) . Once formed, erosional salt pans can persist in the landscape for decades, enlarge in width, and increase in depth after repeated storms or through processes of positive feedback (Morton and Barras, 2011) . The stratigraphic signature of storm-induced salt-pan expansion and infill would be synchronous, continuous mud units overlain by organic-rich tidal-flat mud and salt-marsh peat, similar to the Sea Breeze stratigraphy. Historical observations, however, show that salt pan development did not create sequences 7 or 8 at Sea Breeze. These sequences were created in the middle 19th to 20th centuries. The earliest map of the study area (AD 1887) and historical aerial photos from the 1930s show a series of small lakes separated by a poorly developed network of short and narrow tidal channels rather than a presence of a large open water body (Fig. 8A, B) . The spatially restricted nature of the salt pans indicates that they cannot be responsible for the site-wide stratigraphic nature of sequences 7 and 8 at Sea Breeze, although as secondary processes they likely overprinted and modified the principal sequence. For example, mosquito control ditches that could be responsible for draining small salt pans documented on the AD 1870-1887 map, but are absent on the AD 1930 image (Fig. 8A, B) .\nErosion of salt-marsh peat by the physical action of strong waves and currents during salt-marsh inundation under storm-surge conditions can explain the erosive contacts and regressive sequences described at Sea Breeze (van de Plassche et al., 2004; van de Plassche et al., 2006;  Fig. 1 ). Salt-marsh erosion may occur during the storm or could be a post-storm process triggered by disturbance of vegetation. Numerical modeling and field observations document that temporal disturbance of salt-marsh vegetation led to platform deepening, expansion of tidal creek network, and temporal decrease in marsh accretion rates (Kirwan and Murray, 2008) . All of the above processes may be responsible for sequences 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 at Sea Breeze. During storm surges enhanced by runoff and stream discharge, bed shear stress exceeds the shear strength of sediments. This causes erosion, undercutting and slumping of banks, and deepening of tidal channels (Stefanon et al., 2010) . This process may be responsible for the stratigraphy we describe for sequence 5.\nSignificant loss of salt marshes due to wave erosion, inundation and vegetation loss occurred along the coast of Louisiana after the 1995 hurricane season (Day et al., 2007; Feagin et al., 2009; Ravens et al., 2009) . Vulnerability of salt marshes to storm surge and wave erosion depends on the type of vegetation colonizing the marsh surface. Howes et al. (2010) reported that low-salinity salt marshes predominantly vegetated by S. patens were susceptible to erosion, while highsalinity salt marshes where S. alterniflora with extensive horizontal rhizomes is the most abundant species remained unchanged during tropical cyclone landfalls in Louisiana. The Sea Breeze stratigraphic sequences document repeated erosion or decrease in the elevation of high or brackish marshes during the last 2000 years. Models predict that once a portion of a salt marsh is disturbed and submerged, it takes hundreds of years to fill the accommodation space with sediment to depths capable of supporting vegetation (Kirwan and Murray, 2008) . We estimated that salt-marsh recovery following storm erosion is between 20 and 200 years."}, {"section_title": "Sedimentary record of storm erosion", "text": "The sedimentary record of salt-marsh erosion from storm surges at Sea Breeze can be correlated with geological records of tropical cyclone overwash in New Jersey despite the large (radiocarbon) age uncertainties for some events (Fig. 5) . Back-barrier salt marshes at Brigantine and Whale Beach in southern New Jersey preserved six anomalous sand units deposited since AD 550 (Donnelly et al., 2001b; Donnelly and Webb, 2004;  Fig. 2A) . The most recent overwash fan was deposited by the Ash Wednesday storm in AD 1962 and historical accounts suggest that sand deposition was widespread on back-barrier salt marshes in New Jersey (Stewart, 1962) . Although sequence 8 has variable preservation along transects at Sea Breeze, the mud was revegetated by S. alterniflora after AD 1963 in core 24 (Fig. 7) . However, inconclusive stratigraphy and lack of geochronologic markers from other sites do not allow for correlation of most recent mud deposition with any known storms of the 20th century.\nSequence 7 at Sea Breeze represents erosion that took place between AD 1875 and AD 1925 and we propose that it was caused by a tropical cyclone that made landfall in the Delaware Bay in AD 1903 and was the only tropical cyclone of the 20th century to make landfall in New Jersey (Neumann et al., 1993) . This could be the same tropical cyclone that deposited overwash sand at Brigantine in either AD 1893 or AD 1903 (Donnelly and Webb, 2004) . Erosion and subsequent deposition of sequence 6 at Sea Breeze occurred prior to AD 1827 and could correlate with overwash fans at Brigantine and Whale Beach that were deposited by either the AD 1821 or AD 1788 tropical cyclone (Donnelly et al., 2001b; Donnelly and Webb III, 2004) .\nIf the high salt-marsh peat at the top of sequence 5 was eroded in AD 1788, the deposition of sequence 5 began prior to AD 1665-1696, which could be associated with the same storm that overwashed Brigantine around AD 1526-1558 or AD 1630-1643 (Donnelly et al., 2001b; Donnelly and Webb III, 2004) . The thickness of the mud unit, unconformities, and its patchy presence in a limited number of core sites suggest that sequence 5 is likely associated with erosion and subsequent infill of paleo-channels. In comparison with the modern drainage network, the stratigraphy in sequence 5 shows oversized (width and depth) paleotidal creeks, which could be related to channel erosion due to increased discharge under storm surge hydrology. Furthermore, within the uncertainties of radiocarbon dating sequence 5 at Sea Breeze and the Brigantine overwash fan of AD 1630-1643 could be the result of the same tropical cyclone that eroded salt-marsh sediment in Connecticut and deposited an overwash fan in Rhode Island in AD 1635 or AD 1638 (van de Plassche et al., 2006) .\nRadiocarbon dates indicate that overwash fans were deposited at Brigantine and Whale Beach between AD 550-1400 and AD 1278-1438 respectively (Donnelly et al., 2001b; Donnelly and Webb III, 2004) . During this time period sequences 2, 3, and 4 were formed at Sea Breeze. Sequence 4 includes a 30-60 cm mud unit that was colonized by saltmarsh vegetation by AD 1319-1351 in transect I and AD 1428-1492 in transect III. Deposition of this sequence could be result of one or more storms. It is possible that salt-marsh erosion documented by the sharp contact in sequence 4 is the result of the same event that deposited overwash fans along the coasts of New Jersey and Rhode Island, and eroded a salt marsh in Connecticut (AD 1400-1440). If the latter, this storm had a regional impact, not only along the open coast, but also on sheltered salt marshes (e.g. Sea Breeze, New Jersey and Pattagansett River Marsh, Connecticut). However, the deposition of~1 m thick overwash fan in Brigantine could be the result of an earlier storm as the sand overlays salt-marsh peat that dates back to AD 558-673. Sequence 3 documented in transects I-III was deposited prior to AD 950-1040. The storm that eroded up to 0.6 m of peat and offset deposition of sequence 2 occurred sometime between AD 429 and AD 966.\nDeposition of the thin, lower sand layer at Brigantine may coincide with the earliest erosion event documented in Sea Breeze (sequence 1). Though only~10 cm of mud was deposited, the evidence of a hiatus in core 63 indicates that the elevation of paleo-marsh surface was lowered by erosion. The marsh recovery between AD 260-520 resulted in deposition of low salt-marsh peat while undisturbed brackish conditions persisted along transect I-I\u2032 around AD 214-381 (core 30). The marsh recovery was completed by AD 429-567, which correlates well with AD 558-673 age of salt-marsh surface recovered at Brigantine after deposition of the oldest fan.\nWe interpreted the salt-marsh stratigraphy at Sea Breeze as an erosive record assuming that only fragments of local depositional history remained preserved in it. Proposed unconformities between mud units (Fig. 4) suggest that sequences were destroyed by later storms. We assume that thick units of mud (N 1 m) were formed as multiple storms eroded sequences over and over, followed by infilling of accommodation space with mud units that stacked on top of each other (Fig. 4: Transect I cores 14, 50, 26, 46; Transect II cores 82, 13, 70, 67; . Nevertheless this record is relevant to paleotempestology as it identifies storm-related deposition and may contribute to building a regional database necessary for comprehensive spatial and timeseries analyses of former storm activity."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The historical record of landfalling tropical cyclones and storms is limited, because of the relatively small number of large events that have been documented. Coastal sediments preserve a longer, but fragmentary record of prehistoric events that are typically recognized by deposition of anomalous overwash sands in low-energy environments such as salt marshes. Alternatively, the sedimentary record may preserve the impact of tropical cyclones and storms as repeated sequences of salt-marsh erosion and recovery. The stratigraphic record at Sea Breeze, NJ includes seven complete (and one incomplete) sequences of erosion and salt-marsh recovery that we attribute to storm surges. This record of abrupt, erosive boundaries and infilling of newly created accommodation space with mud correlates well with historical and geological records of tropical cyclone activity in New Jersey and New England and indicates that at least seven tropical cyclones and/or storms impacted the north shore of Delaware Bay in the past~2000 years. This record compliments and extends the limited geologic data of tropical cyclone erosion for southern New Jersey. It also demonstrates that salt-marsh sedimentary sequences can be used as a tool for stormimpact risk assessment. Lateral continuity of erosive boundaries mapped in the study area indicates that estuarine salt marshes are as vulnerable to storm erosion as the open coast. It takes from several decades to almost 200 years for complete salt-marsh recovery after storm erosion.\nWe thank two anonymous reviewers and Editor Andrew Plater for comments that greatly improved the quality of the manuscript."}]
