In particular, women have verbal memory strengths that appear to be sustained early in the disease, despite measurable pathological changes, including fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) abnormalities [1] , hippocampal volume (HV) loss [2] , and amyloid beta (A\u03b2) protein accumulation as shown by a positive amyloid PET scan [3, 4] . This early preserved memory may delay diagnosis [5] , which is troubling given evidence that women-and particularly those with risk factors such as Apolipoprotein \u03b54 (APOE \u03b54) genotype-may decline faster than men, once ADrelated cognitive decline has begun [6] [7] [8] [9] . The exact timing of women's memory changes in AD remains unknown and a topic of interest [10] .\nMemory advantages in women throughout the lifespan could relate to a variety of etiological factors (e.g., [9, [11] [12] [13] [14] ). Proximally, preservation of memory is expected to be reflected in resilience in neural structures and functions that subserve healthy memory. Although memory relies on a complex network of neural regions interacting effectively, the central role of the hippocampus in episodic memory (for a review, see [15] ) and in AD [16] makes this structure a natural candidate for underlying neural resilience. Specifically, the hippocampus is critical for memory consolidation, and damage to the hippocampus can lead to decreased ability to learn and recall new information [15] . In AD, the hippocampus is impacted by pathology early in the disease course, with neurofibrillary tangle buildup beginning in the cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) and subiculum regions and progressing throughout the hippocampus in a predictable fashion [16] .\nPrevious work from our group has built preliminary support for relatively preserved total and right hippocampal volume (HV) [3] and right subiculum subfield volume [17] in women. Specifically, with a trend-level finding, our data suggested that sex moderated the effects of diagnosis and amyloid PET positivity on HV. In women, positive amyloid PET related to smaller HV only at the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage, but not in cognitively normal women. The pattern in men was similar, but the differences were not significant [3] . When we examined these findings by hippocampal subfield, we replicated the effect only within the right subiculum [17] .\nImportantly, if sex relates to a time-limited preservation of memory and/or HV in AD, analyses of sex effects should consider both diagnostic trajectory (i.e., normal cognition to MCI to dementia) and presence of biomarkers such as brain amyloid and tau measured by PET or indexed by the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This process allows for higher certainty that sex effects are occurring in AD and not general to non-AD cognitive impairment.\nWork on sex differences in AD has been done with large, well-characterized study samples, and especially in one study population (the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI]). However, a key step in understanding sex differences in AD is exploring whether findings within ADNI replicate in different samples and with different measures.\nThe current investigation sought to examine whether the effects of AD proteinopathy on memory and hippocampal volume differ based on sex in the Swedish BioFIN-DER cohort. BioFINDER offers advantages in that it includes a clinically representative sample of patients who were consecutively referred to participating memory clinics and control participants recruited from an ongoing population-based study (the Malm\u00f6 Diet and Cancer study) [18] . Both groups on average have levels of education more typical of an aging population than in some other large study samples [19] and were scanned on the same magnetic resonance (MR) scanner. BioFINDER also includes measures of other cognitive domains, including visuospatial skills, attention, and processing speed skills, allowing for assessment of the specificity of effects to the memory domain. Altogether, these advantages position the BioFINDER [20] sample well to identify associations between biomarkers of pathological change and cognition.\nBased on our prior results [3, 17] , we hypothesized that women would show early relative preservation of memory and HV, such that these variables would be impacted less by AD proteinopathy (A\u03b2/P-tau+) in CN women than in CN men. In other words, women, but not men, with preclinical AD would show early preservation of these variables. We hypothesized this effect would be specific to memory and not generalized to other cognitive domains. We further hypothesized that at the symptomatic stage, A\u03b2+ women would no longer show relative preservation of memory and HV, and no sex differences would be observed."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Participants were selected from the Swedish BioFINDER study, which is a prospective, longitudinal study examining disease mechanisms in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders using several fluid and imaging biomarkers (see http://biofinder.se for more information about the study design).

The MCI classification was based on the results of a comprehensive neuropsychological battery and the clinical assessment of a senior neuropsychologist and two physicians [23] . Patients with composite z-scores of \u2264 \u2212 1.5 standard deviations (SD) in at least one cognitive domain were classified as MCI (at least two different tests were used for each cognitive domain). In agreement with the DSM-5 criteria for mild neurocognitive disorders, all subjects with z-scores of \u2212 1 to \u2212 1.5 were individually assessed by the neuropsychologist and classified as MCI if their premorbid ability or individual test scores within each domain indicated a significant cognitive decline. Among the MCI participants, 75% were categorized as amnestic MCI and 25% as non-amnestic MCI. The participants with cognitive complaints who did not fulfill the criteria for MCI or dementia were classified as having SCD.

To further examine sex differences in the effect of AD proteinopathy on memory, we ran GLMs using delayed recall omissions as dependent variable and A\u03b2/P-tau, age, and education as independent variables. This model was tested separately for men and women in all diagnostic subgroups (primary analyses separately in CN and symptomatic patients, and in secondary analyses with symptomatic patients stratified into SCD and MCI).

Namely, A\u03b2/P-tau+ CN women (i.e., women with preclinical AD) appear to have verbal memory reserve or resilience in the presence of measurable AD-related disease burden. This result is consistent with our and others' work showing that women's memory has some early resilience to a number of markers of AD burden, including abnormal brain metabolism [1] , hippocampal atrophy [2] , and positive amyloid PET [3, 4] . Importantly, the current results replicate our prior findings in a separate sample that incorporated different measures of memory and amyloid proteinopathy, supporting the robustness of this finding [3] . Early verbal memory preservation may have implications for how normal cognition is defined in research and in clinical trials. For example, it may be more critical when examining longitudinal or interventional outcomes to define baseline group membership using biomarkers in combination with cognitive testing, if women are included in the sample. From a clinical diagnosis perspective, this finding emphasizes the importance of cognitive baseline assessment, as early neuropsychological testing may be able to identify women who have normal cognition yet have lost some memory functioning over time. Employing memory assessments that are not purely verbal may also be important for increasing validity of memory assessment across sexes.\nSupplementary analyses showed that verbal memory was not preserved in A\u03b2/P-tau+ women with SCD as compared to A\u03b2/P-tau\u2212 women with SCD. In addition, in the SCD group, women no longer outperformed men in verbal memory. This pattern suggests that among women with increased risk for AD dementia (A\u03b2/P-tau+), memory reserve or resilience is limited to CN women with no cognitive concerns. This finding is consistent with studies showing that SCD is associated with positive AD biomarkers and longitudinal cognitive decline ([for recent review on SCD, see [31] ), as well as with research showing that AD proteinopathy in the context of SCD is a strong predictor of decline [32] . However, this finding stands in contrast to research within the ADNI sample, showing that women outperform men on verbal memory tasks despite mild to moderate levels of AD-related burden [1, 2] . It is possible that the current finding relates to A\u03b2/P-tau+ women with SCD in the BioFINDER sample having more than a moderate level of AD-related disease burden. Alternatively, the finding may relate to other differences between samples. Specifically, the greater education levels-and thereby greater general cognitive reserve-in the ADNI sample may have an impact. On the other hand, in the BioFINDER sample, individuals with SCD have been referred to a memory specialist due to cognitive symptoms, whereas in ADNI, individuals with SCD reported symptoms when queried. In this context, our findings suggest that for women seeking a memory specialist, SCD could be not only a marker of risk, but also an indicator that subclinical memory changes are already measurable on cognitive testing. This suggestion is in part consistent with very recent work in other cohorts [33, 34] . The current study did not confirm hypotheses about sex-specific HV preservation. Previously, we have shown in the ADNI sample that CN women with positive amyloid PET studies show no difference in total HV and subiculum subfield volume, compared to CN women with negative amyloid PET, but that volumetric decrements are observed in amyloid-positive women at the MCI stage [3, 17] . Reasons for lack of replication are unclear but could include slight differences in methodology or sample composition, such as inclusion of CN and symptomatic groups in the present analysis as well as differences in the biomarkers used to define the presence of proteinopathy. Lack of replication emphasizes the need for additional research on how this structure-with Fig. 1 Comparison of the A\u03b2/P-tau effect on memory in men and women. Comparison of 10 word delayed recall performance in A\u03b2/P-tau+ and A\u03b2/P-tau\u2212 participants, stratified by sex, in a healthy controls and b patients with cognitive symptoms. Comparisons were adjusted for age and education. Further comparison among the symptomatic patients (SCD and MCI) is shown in Additional file 1: Figure S1 known developmental [35] , aging-related [36, 37] , and neurochemical sex differences [38] -does or does not show patterns of dysfunction and atrophy that differ by sex in AD. In addition, this finding underscores the importance of considering other neural underpinnings of early sex-based memory preservation and later decline. As important context, there are known sex by APOE \u03b54 interactive effects, with evidence for more deleterious effects of APOE \u03b54 on cognition, hippocampal structure, brain function at rest, and tau pathology in women than men ( [6, 39] , for a recent review see [40] ). The present analysis showed that men and women did not differ in number of APOE \u03b54 carriers and also controlled for effects of APOE \u03b54. Despite these efforts to show our findings were not driven by APOE \u03b54 status, adding APOE \u03b54 as an interaction term was beyond the scope of the present analysis due to limited power. Further work is needed on how memory reserve presents over the AD spectrum in women with APOE \u03b54.\nLimitations of this analysis include having a smaller sample size than studies that combine across cohorts, which is particularly relevant when evaluating complex interactions. Although the current study in part replicates prior work by our group [3] , the challenges of complex interactions and multiple comparisons mean that wider replication is important to ensure generalizable conclusions. Expanding the analysis to additional regions of interest will also be important for generalizability. The sample included is also majority white, and research in diverse samples will be key to generalizing the findings to all women. The current analysis was also cross-sectional in nature, limiting ability to interpret memory findings as true losses of function over time. In contrast, the present study has strengths in that participants are more representative of the general aging population than in some other cohorts [18, 19] , were more thoroughly assessed and diagnosed, and have had brain imaging conducted on the same MRI magnet."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In conclusion, this study shows relative preservation of verbal memory in the presence of AD proteinopathy, limited to women with normal cognition, and not in women with reported or measured memory symptoms. This resilience was specific to memory and was not present for other cognitive functions.
