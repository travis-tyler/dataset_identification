The data indicate that, after a dramatic increase in minority enrollment in the 1960s and 1970s, there was uneven progress made in the 1980s. The proportion of black students elrolled in institutions of higher education decreased from 9.2 percent in 1980 to 8.9 percent in 1990. Among black undergraduates, nearly two-thirds were women, compared with 53 percent of Hispanics and 55 percent of Whites. The report also indicates that black students were more likely to be enrolled in private, for-profit institutions and less likely to be enrolled in 4-year institutions than white students. Undergraduates who attended historically black colleges and universities were more likely to aspire to an advanced degree than were students at other 4-year institutions. Persistence rates for 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students pursuing a bachelor's degree tended to be higher for Asian/Pacific Islander students than for black students.

Currently, it is estimated that about 20 percent of all available job openings require 4 years or more of college, and the U.S. Department of Labor estimates the proportion will be 27 percent by the year 2000) At the same time, there have been dramatic shifts in the nation's demographic profile as non-white and Hispanic populations are becoming an ever larger proportion of the college-age population. The U.S. Bureau of the Census estimates that by the year 2000, nearly one-third of the entire school-age population (5-24 years old) will be nonwhite or Hispanic.2 Furthermore, by the end of this century, about 40 percent of the nation's work force will be immigrants who arrived after 1980 (or their descendaiits).3 The Population Reference Bureau projects that about half of all Americans will be Hispanic, Asian, or black by the year 2080 if current trends continue.4 Concurrent with increasing proportions of minorities in the school-age population has been a decline in the overall college-age population and, thus, in the number of entrylevel workers. This shrinking entry-level labor force offers minorities opportunities for advancement provided postsecondary education institutions offer adequate training to meet the demand.5 Enrollment of Minority Students in Higher Education: [1980][1981][1982][1983][1984][1985][1986][1987][1988][1989][1990][1991][1992] After a dramatic increase in minority enrollment in the 1960s and 1970s, there was uneven progress made in the decade between 1980 and 1990 (figure 1).6 For example, the proportion of black, non-Hispanic students enrolled in institutions of higher education changed little between 1980 and 1990, ranging from 9.2 percent of the higher education population in 1980 to 8.7 percent in 1988, and rising once again to 8.9 percent in 1990. It is encouraging to note, however, that the share of black, non-Hispanic  Census, 1986, cited in The Road to College: Educational Progress by Race and Ethnicity, a joint publication of the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education and The College Board (Boulder, CO: 1991). 3Cited in \"A Difference of Degrees: State Initiatives to Improve Minority Student Achievement,\" (Denver, CO: State Higher Education Executive Officers Association, 1987);17. 4lbid. 5lbid."}, {"section_title": "2U.S. Bureau of the", "text": "6For a detailed review of minority enrollment, attrition, and completion in higher education, see D.J.

This recent increase in enrollment was noted for both black, non-Hispanic males (7.6 to 8.2 percent) and females (10.0 to 10.8 percent) (figures 2 and 3).7 American Indians/Alaskan Natives also experienced little growth in enrollment in the 1980s; however, like black, non-Hispanic students, their enrollment rose between 1990 and 1992, from 103,000 students to 119,000, representing an increase of 0.1 percent in their proportions among all students in higher education (0.7 to 0.8 percent). Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander students, on the other hand, experienced more continual growth in enrollment over the 12 -year period between 1980 and 1992. Asian/Pacific Islander students doubled their enrollment rate from 2.4 percent H 1980 to 4.8 percent of the total higher education population in 1992; during the same peliod, Hispanics increased their enrollment rates from 3.9 to 6.6. In contrast to Asians/Pacific Islanders, however, Hispanics were more heavily concentrated in 2-year institutions than in 4-year institutions (9.5 percent compared with 4.7 percent) (figures 4 and 5).8 Even though minorities constitute an increasing proportion of college students, they are still underrepresented in postsecondary education (table 1). In 1990, for example, nearly 29 percent of the population aged 18-24 were non-white or Hispanic, whereas about 23 percent were enrolled in higher education in the same year. Minority representation further declined with respect to degree attainment in the same year: 18 percent of associate's degree recipients and 16 percent of bachelor's degree recipients were non-white or Hispanic students. Lower levels of attainment for American Indians/ Alaskan Natives, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic black students were especially apparent when compared with their non-Hispanic white peers.9 For example, while black, non-Hispanic studems made up about 14 percent of the population aged 18-24 in 1990, they accounted for about 10 percent of those enrolled in higher education, 8 percent of associate's degree recipients, and 6 percent of bachelor's degree recipients. White, non-Hispanic students, on the other hand, represented 72 percent of the population aged 18-24, 78 percent of higher education enrollment, 82 percent of associate's degree recipients, and 84 percent of bachelor's degree recipients.    and Trends in Enrollment in Higher Education, by Racial/Ethnic Category: Fall 1982 through Fall 1992 (NCES 94-104); based on Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) \"Fall Enrollment\" surveys."}, {"section_title": "x4", "text": "Figure 2-Percentage distribution of all male students enrolled in higher education by race-ethnicity: Fall 1980race-ethnicity: Fall -1992    and Trends in Enrollment in Higher Education, by Racial/Ethnic Category: Fall 1982 through Fall 1992 (NCES 94-104); based on Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) \"Fall Enrollment\" surveys."}, {"section_title": "5", "text": "A. 0 Figure 4-Percentage distribution of students enrolled in 4-year institutions of higher education by race-ethnicity:    "}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "In recent years, a number of researchers have examined the attrition of minority students in postsecondary education.\u00b0 This research has identified academic background and high school preparation-in particular, students' grade point average, study habits, and high school curricula-as factors that have the most impact on students' progress in postsecondary education.\" As one would expect, background characteristics associated with socioeconomic status are also strongly related to college persistence: minority students whose parents are better educated and have higher incomes are more likely to succeed than those whose parents are less educated or have lower incomes.12 This research has also identified a number of college environmental factors that bear a strong relationship to attrition. For example, initial enrollment in a community college reduces students' chances of attaining a bachelor's degree,13 while enrollment in tosee, for example, Astin et al., Minorities in American Higher Education (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 1988), and D.J. Jones and B.C. Watson, \"High Risk\" Students in Higher Education, ASHE-ERIC Higher Education Reports (Washington, DC: 1990). It should be noted that Asian American/Pacific Islander undergraduates as a group have the highest persistence and attainment rates compared with other racialethnic groups. However, variation according to national origin is likely. 11Astin et al., [180][181]and Jones and Watson,10. 13It should be noted that students may enter community colleges without intending to attain a degree, but simply to improve skills or enhance career opportunities. Furthermore, other factors related to enrolling in a community college instead of a 4-year college may be indirectly related to lower degree attainment, such as a lack of financial resources. a 4-year college or university enhances their persistence. These studies have also emphasized the important role of financial factors in the persistence of minority students. For instance, working full time while attending school tends to reduce minority students' persistence to a bachelor's degree, while the receipt of financial aid in the form of grants or scholarships positively influences persistence.\" Finally, researchers have found that students who live away from home while attending college are more likely to persist than those who live at home with their parents. This was found to be especially true for black, non-Hispanic and Hispanic students.15"}, {"section_title": "Purpose and Data Sources", "text": "The purpose of this report is to provide additional information concerning minority student participation in postsecondary education based on data from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:90) and its longitudinal component, Beginning Postsecondary Students (BPS:90/92). The NPSAS data were used to examine in detail the types of institutions undergraduates attended; their degree program and educational aspirations; their reasons for choosing the postsecondary institutions they attended; and the primary means of financing their education. In addition, NPSAS is large enough to provide estimates of specific Asian/Pacific Islander and Hispanic subgroups. Thus, data for these subgroups are presented separately. A longitudinal cohort of NPSAS:93 undergraduates who were enrolled in postsecondary education for the first time in 1989-90 were followed up in 1992 (BPS:90/92). For these students, attainment rates for some sub-baccalaureate awards and interim persistence rates for students in bachelor's degree programs were available as of spring 1992. For students who did not interrupt their education, this would be the second term of their third academic year. Some students, however, were not continuously enrolled; they had interrupted their education and subsequently returned. In the case of students pursuing a bachelor's degree, the percentage of students who interrupted and reenrolled is presented."}, {"section_title": "Minority Students Included in the Analysis", "text": "In education survey researcti, non-white racialethnic groups are often compared in the aggregate with white, non-Hispanic students because the sample sizes of minority subgroups are too small to produce reliable estimates. Thus, these analyses fail to illuminate differences not only among different minority groups but also within aggregated ethnic groups, such as Hispanics and Asians/Pacific Islanders. The size of the NPSAS survey (about 40,000 undergraduates) is large enough to provide at least an overall snapshot of these main groups, as well as the specific Asian/Pacific Islander and \"See also, U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Undergraduates Who Work While Enrolled in Postsecondary Education (Washington, DC: 1994). 15Astin, ct. al., 183.

I. the survey, Asian/Pacific Islander and Hispanic students were asked for their specific subgroup identity.16 However, those who chose not to identify themselves, those belonging to groups too small to be disaggregated, or students of mixed identity were categorized as \"other/non-specified\" (figure 6). These \"other\" groups were largest among both Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander subgroups, illustrating the diversity of their origins. Throughout the remainder of this report, minority student groups are identified as follows. The specific terms and definitions for each minority group were designated by the Office of Management and Budget Statistical Policy directive (No. 15, May 12, 1977). American Indian or Alaskan Native. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North America and who maintains cultural identification through tribal affiliation or community recognition. For accuracy and consistency with previously published data, the term American Indian/Alaskan Native is used to identify these students, recognizing that the term Native American is sometimes preferred. American Indian/Alaskan Native students are a particularly small group of undergraduates. Because of their small sample size, some estimates of participation and all estimates of persistence in postsecondary education could not be reported.\" Asian or Pacific Islander. A person having origins in any of the Pacific Islander original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, the Indian Subcontinent, or Pacific Islands. This includes peoples from China, Japan, Korea, the Philippine Islands, Samoa, India, and Vietnam. In addition, the NPSAS data provide estimates for subgroups including Asian Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Pacific Islander (Filipino, Hawaiian, Samoan, and Guamanian), and Vietnamese. A group called \"other\" includes those from other origins and those who did not specify their ethnic group. Like the American Indian/Alaskan Native undergraduate population, each of these Asian subgroups is very small, and some estimates could not be reported. In addition, some differences in estimates between subgroups may appear large, but they are often not statistically significant. Only differences that are statistically significant are discussed in this report. Black, non-Hispanic. A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa, not of Hispanic origin. While the terms African American, Black American, or 16In the survey, students were first asked their race (white, black, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian/Pacific Islander, or other); If they indicated \"other,\" they were then asked if they were of Spanish/Hispanic origin. Those who indicated Spanish/Hispanic origin were asked to identify themselves as Mexican/Mexican-American/Chicano; Cuban; Puerto Rican; or to specify their origin if they were other than these three groups. Similarly, American Indians/Alaskan Natives were asked to specify their tribe, and Asians were asked if they were Chinese, Filipino, Hawaiian, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Asian Indian, Samoan, or Guamanian, or to specify their subgroup if they were not one of these ethnicities. However, students were not given the specific definitions of each group. 17Estimates based on samples of fewer than 30 students cannot be reported. Person of Color are often preferred, to preserve consistency with previously published education data and for accuracy, the term black, non-Hispanic is used in this report. Hispanic. A person of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race. Again, to preserve data reporting consistency, the term Hispanic is used in this report, with the recognition that Latino as a generic term for all people of Latin American/Spanish origin may be preferred. The NPSAS data also provide estimates for subgroups including Mexican American, Puerto Rican, and Cuban American students. A group called \"other\" includes those of other Hispanic origins and those who did not specify their ethnic group. White, non-Hispanic. For comparisons with minority groups, estimates for white, non-Hispanic undergraduates are also presented. These are students with origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, North Africa, or the Middle East (except those of Hispanic origin)."}, {"section_title": "Citizenship", "text": "The results presented in the remainder of this report include all noncitizens, who account for about 5 percent of undergraduates. The non-citizens are primarily Asian/ Pacific Islander (30 percent) and Hispanic (17 percent). However, most of these noncitizens are permanent residents or are eligible for financial aid as individuals in the country for \"other than a temporary purpose,\" including refugees, persons granted asylum, and so on. (See The Federal Student Financial Aid Handbook for a more detailed description of these students).'s Therefore, given their relatively permanent status in this country, all noncitizens were included in the analysis. Thus, there are some instances where minority groups are referred to as American (such as Mexican American), which may include a small percentage of noncitizens.     In the last 20 years, the proportion of so-called nontraditional students in postsecondary education has increased dramatically.'9 This is especially true for older students who for various reasons delayed their entry into college or other postsecondary education programs.2\u00b0 Students who delay their postsecondary education are more at risk of not completing a credential than those who have followed a more traditional educational path.21 Given this association between delayed entry and attainment, it may not be surprising that Asian/Pacific Islander undergraduates, who have higher college completion rates than other students, tended to be younger (thus, less likely to have delayed their college entry), while black, non-Hispanic and American Indian/Alaskan Native students tended to be older (table 2). About two-thirds of Asian/Pacific Islander students (63 percent), compared with about one-half of black, non-Hispanic students (52 percent) were 23 or younger. By contrast, 36 percent of American Indian/Alaskan Natives and 28 percent of black, non-Hispanic students were age 30 or older, compared with 18 percent of Asian/Pacific Islander students. Many members of minority groups, especially Vietnamese and Puerto Ricans, are economically disadvantaged. In 1989-90, undergraduates in all racialethnic minority groups were less well off financially than were their white, non-Hispanic peers (table 3) Approximately one-third or more of minority students (30 percent of American Indians/ Alaskan Natives, 35 percent of Asians/Pacific Islanders, 39 percent of Hispanics, and 41 percent of black, non-Hispanic students) were in the lowest family income quartile, compared with about one-fifth of white, non-Hispanic students.22 In addition, the income distribution within Hispanic and Asian subgroups varied. For example, Cuban Americans (8 percent of all Hispanics) were substantially more affluent than other Hispanic groups: about 37 percent were in the highest income quartile, compared with about 16 percent of either Mexican Americans or Puerto Ricans. When Asian/Pacific Islander ethnic groups were disaggregated, Vietnamese students were found to be among the poorest enrolled, with about two-thirds (68 percent) haviniz, incomes at or below the 25th percentile.   In 1989-90, men and women enrolled in postsecondary education at different rates, and there was also variation in the gender distribution among racial-ethnic groups. For example, 55 percent of all undergraduates and two-thirds of black, non-Hispanic students were female (table 4). To a lesser extent, Hispanic students were also more likely to be female (53 compared with 47 percent). On the other hand, there was no significant difference in the proportion of males and females enrolled for either Asians/Pacific Islanders or American Indians/Alaskan Natives.23 23While it appears as though more males than females were enrolled for these two groups, the difference is not statistically significant. "}, {"section_title": "Minority Students' Enrollment and Educational Goals", "text": "One of the more striking differences among minority groups with respect to their enrollment in 1989-90 was the tendency of black, non-Hispanic and Hispanic students to attend private, for-profit institutions (table 5). About 20 percent of black, non-Hispanic students and 15 percent of Hispanic students were enrolled in such institutions, compared with 5 percent of Asians/Pacific Islanders and 6 percent of white, non-Hispanic students. Private, for-profit institutions typically offer programs of short duration leading to a vocational certificate in fields such as cosmetology; administrative and secretarial programs; health-related programs such as physician assistant and practical nursing; and trade and industry programs leading to such jobs as mechanics and repairers. In contrast, black, non-Hispanic; Hispanic; and American Indian/Alaskan Native students were less likely to be enrolled in 4-year colleges or universities than were white, non-Hispanic students (table 6). In addition, black, non-Hispanic and Hispanic students who did attend colleges and universities were less likely than Asian/Pacific Islander students to be in fields with greater economic returns, such as science and engineering (table 7)."}, {"section_title": "2", "text": "Among Hispanic ethnic groups, there were also differences in the types of institutions students attended (table 6). For example, two-thirds of Mexican Americans were enrolled in 2-year institutions (most of which are public community colleges), whereas the majority of Puerto Ricans (65 percent) were enrolled in 4-year colleges or universities. Cuban American students, on the other hand, were more evenly distributed in their enrollment at 2-year and 4-year institutions (49 and 48 percent, respectively). Despite their concentration in sub-baccalaureate institutions, black, non-Hispanic and Hispanic students were just as likely as white, non-Hispanic students to aspire to a bachelor's degree or to an advanced degree as their ultimate educational goal (table 8). The same was true for American Indians/Alaskan Natives, 24 percent or whom were enrolled in a baccalaureate program in 1989-90, compared with 40 percent of either Asian/Pacific Islander or white, non-Hispanic students. But when asked what their ultimate educational aspirations were, 37 percent of American Indians/Alaskan Natives reported a bachelor's degree, and 47 percent reported an advanced degree. These aspirations were no different from those of white, non-Hispanic undergraduates.  "}, {"section_title": "'d", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Attendance at Historically Black Colleges and Universities", "text": "Historically black colleges and institutions were first established in the 1800s to counter the practice of prohibiting the education of black persons.24 Their earliest appearance was before the Civil War when almost all black persons were still slaves. However, it was only after the Civil War and in the late 1800s that modest gains were made in educational opportunities for minorities. During this time, Congress passed the Second Morrill Act, which established a dual system of higher education-one for whites and one for non-whites. All schools were run by white administrators until 1927, when Mordecai Johnson was named Howi d University's first black president. At that time, there were 77 HBCUs with about 14,000 students enrolled. Today there are 105 such institutions enrolling approximately 258,000 students. Most HBCUs (about 90 percent) are 4-year colleges, and about half are private, not-for-profit institutions.25 Between 1986 and 1990, enrollment in HBCUs increased 15 percent, and according to the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) survey of higher education institutions, about 17 percent of black, non-Hispanic students attended HBCUs in the fall of 1990.26 While the overwhelming majority of students attending HBCUs were black, non-Hispanic, about one-fourth came from other racialethnic groups. Among the NPSAS:90 undergraduates attending HBCUs, for example, about 75 percent were black, non-Hispanic; 15 percent white, non-Hispanic; 7 percent Hispanic; and less than 3 percent each were either Asian/Pacific Islander or American Indian/Alaskan Native (table 9). Students attending HBCUs reported somewhat higher educational aspirations than those attending non-HBCUs. For example, among undergraduates enrolled in 4-year colleges and universities, 77 percent of those attending HBCUs reported their educational goal as an advanced degree, compared with 71 percent of students attending non-HBCUs (table 10). 26Ibid., 6. Note that the NPSAS:90 survey is based on full-year enrollment and includes students in forprofit trade schools, leading one to expect that the overall proportion of black, non-Hispanic students in the NPSAS sample who are enrolled in HBCUs would be somewhat lower than that in IPEDS. This was in fact the case: about 12 percent of all black, non-Hispanic students enrolled in postsecondary education were enrolled in HBCUs. However, if NPSAS:90 is limited to the fall sample of public and private, notfor-profit institutions, the percentage of black, non-Hispanic students is about 14 percent. r, "}, {"section_title": "Reasons Students Reported for Choosing Their Institution", "text": "Regardless of racialethnic group, almost all undergraduates (two-thirds or more) cited academic reasons (e.g., institution's overall reputation, its reputation for placing graduates, and its having the desired courses) as important factors in choosing their institution. Differences among racialethnic groups did emerge, however, in the proportion of students citing financially-related reasons for choosing their institutions (table 11). For example, black, non-Hispanic; Hispanic; and Asian/Pacific Islander undergraduates were all more likely to cite the opportunity for obtaining a job at school as an important reason for their choice (34 to 38 percent) than were white, non-Hispanic students (26 percent). While a majority of students reported that being able to work and attend school was an important reason for their choice, Asians/Pacific Islanders were less likely than black, non-Hispanic or Hispanic students to do so (65 percent compared with 75 percent and 78 percent, respectively). This is consistent with the finding that Asian/Pacific Islander students are less likely to work while attending school than other racialethnic groups.27 Corresponding in part to their lower incomes, black, non-Hispanic students were the most likely to report that obtaining financial aid was an important reason for their choice of institution (57 percent compared with 42 percent of Hispanics, 41 percent of American Indians/Alaskan Natives, 38 percent of Asians/Pacific Islanders, and 33 percent of white, non-Hispanics). Among Hispanic ethnic groups, a greater proportion of Puerto Ricans cited the possibility of obtaining financial aid as an important reason for their choice of institution than did either Mexican or Cuban American students (64 percent compared with 40 percent and 32 percent, respectively). The difference between Puerto Rican and Mexican American studerts may be due to Puerto Ricans' greater likelihood of attending higher cost 4-year institutions, whereas Mexican Americans were more likely to be enrolled in 2-year institutions.  Finishing their postsecondary education in a short amount of time was especially important to Hispanic and black, non-Hispanic students, which is consistent with their higher attendance at less-than-2year institutions: about two-thirds of black, non-Hispanic and Hispanic students as reported this an important factor in choosing their school, as compared with 55 percent of white, non-Hispanic students. Finally, the importance of living at home while attending school, the reason for which may be financial and/or cultural, distinguished Hispanics from Asians/Pacific Islanders and white, non-Hispanic students: about three-fourths (73 percent) of Hispanics cited this as an important reason for their school choice, as compared with 65 percent of Asians/Pacific islanders and 60 percent of white, non-Hispanic students.28 Asian/Pacific Islander students, on the other hand, were much more likely to cite having friends who nThe percentage of Hispanic students is not significantly different from that of black, non-Hispanic students (67 percent)."}, {"section_title": "23", "text": ".3 4 attend the same institution as an important factor for their school choice, compared with Hispanic; black, non-Hispanic; or white, non-Hispanic students (33 percent compared with 19 to 24 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Financial Aid", "text": "The receipt of financial aid is determined by family income, school costs, and whether or not a student is financially dependent on his or her parents. Thus, differences in the receipt and amounts of aid among racial ethnic groups are due to differences in these determinants of financial aid. (Differences in loan aid may also depend on students' willingness to borrow.) However, given their overall lower incomes, the receipt of financial aid may disproportionately affect minority students' access to and persistence in postsecondary education when compared with their white, non-Hispanic counterparts who have greater financial resources.29 Consistent with their lower incomes, black, non-Hispanic students were more likely to get financial aid than any other racial-ethnic group, with the exception of American Indians/Alaskan Natives: about 60 percent of black, non-Hispanic undergraduates, compared with 50 percent, 36 percent, and 40 percent of Hispanic; Asian/Pacific Islander; and white, non-Hispanic students, respectively (table 12).30 Hispanics were, in turn, more likely to get aid than were either Asian/Pacific Islander or white, non-Hispanic students. Similar differences were seen for both grant and loan aid receipt: a greater percentage of black, non-Hispanic students received grants (53 percent) than did Hispanics (44 percent), Asians/Pacific Islanders (31 percent), or white, non-Hispanic students (33 percent). Likewise, nearly one-third (29 percent) of black, non-Hispanic students received loans, compared with 19 percent of Hispanics, 14 -ercent of Asians/Pacific Islanders, and 18 percent of white, non-Hispanic students. Differences in the receipt of aid were also noted among Asian and Hispanic subgroups, which for the most part corresponded to the different income levels of these students. For example, about 40 percent of all Asian/Pacific Islander students received aid; however, Vietnamese students were more likely to receive financial aid (58 percent) than many other Asian ethnic groups including Japanese, Chinese, and Pacific Islander students. Among Hispanic subgroups, Puerto Ricans were nearly twice as likely to receive aid (63 percent) than were Mexican Americans (34 percent), even though these two 29A forthcoming NCES report, (How Low-Income Students Finance Their Education), examines in detail the relationship between financial aid and the postsecondary education experiences of low-income students. 30About one-half of American Indians/Alaskan Natives received aid. which was not statistically different from any other group. 24 0 I) ethnic groups differed little in their distribution among income levels (see table 9). The difference in aid receipt is probably due to Puerto Ricans' propensity to be enrolled in higher cost 4-year institutions, compared with Mexican Americans' likelihood to be enrolled in community colleges. For students who first began their postsecondary education in 1989-90, nearly one-half (45 percent) reported that their current degree objective was a bachelor's degree, while 27 percent were seeking an associate's degree. Approximately 15 percent had relatively short-term educational objectives and reported pursuing a vocational certificate.31 Since the length of time required to complete these three programs is so different (for example, a vocational certificate is often earned in less than one year), the persistence rates for these three groups are presented separately. Consistent with historical trends, persistence rates for students pursuing a bachelor's degree tended to be higher for Asian/Pacific Islander students than for Hispanic and black, non-Hispanic students (figure 7).32 For example, 69 percent of Asian/Pacific Islander students were continuously enrolled through the spring of 1992, compared with 46 percent of Hispanic students and 50 percent of black, non-Hispanic students.33 On the other hand, persistence for white, non-Hispanic students (58 percent) was not significantly different from any other group. Despite the fact that an associate's degree is traditionally viewed as a 2-year program, among undergraduates pursuing an associate's degree, only about 12 percent of beginning postsecondary students seeking such a degree had actually completed it after nearly 3 years. This result reflects the tendency of these students to attend community colleges on a part-time basis (figure 8).34 For students who completed their degree, the differences in completion rates among Hispanic; black, non-Hispanic; and white, non-Hispanic students were not statistically significant: 17 percent, 8 percent, and 13 percent, respectively. (The sample of Asian/Pacific Islander students was not large enough for a reliable estimate.) However, because of the extent of part-time enrollment in these programs, many students were still enrolled at the end of their third year. This was particularly true for Hispanic students who were less likely than black, non-Hispanic students to have left school with no credential (28 percent compared with 53 percent) and to have never reenrolled. 3IThese estimates were from the NOES BPS:90/92 Data Analysis System. Undergraduate degree goal is based on students' response to the question: \"Toward which degree or other award are the courses you are taking leading'?\" It was therefore possible for students to be working toward a degree that the institution did not offer. (For example, a student could be attending a community college and pursuing a bachelor's degree.) Thus, this variable differs from \"undergraduate program,\" a variable representing the current program in which the student is enrolled that is reported by the institution. 32The sample size of American Indians/Alaskan Natives was not large enough to provide reliable estimates and is not included in this discussion. 33The difference between Asians/Pacific Islanders and black, non-Hispanic students is significant at   As might be expected, given the shorter time needed to complete a certificate, students seeking a certificate were more likely to complete one by spring 1992 than those pursuing an associate's degree (figure 9). About 44 percent of black, non-Hispanic students and 32 percent of Hispanic students seeking a certificate had completed. While differences in completion and attrition among racialethnic groups were not statistically significant, the sample for this group of students was very small, and it would be difficult to detect differences that are actually present in the population."}, {"section_title": "Controlling for Factors Related to Persistence", "text": "Since racialethnic groups differ with respect to a number of background characteristics as well as their postsecondary experiences in general, it is instructive to try to control for some of these factors to see if the differences in persistence rates initially observed among racialethnic groups change.\" Therefore, we estimated the joint effect of a number of variables using a linear regression model.36 The regression coefficients were subsequently used to adjust the estimate for the proportion of students pursuing a bachelor's degree who were continuously enrolled through spring 1992. The independent variables initially included in the model were raceethnicity (with white, non-Hispanic students serving as the comparison group); gender; income (family income if the student is dependent and student income if the student is independent); age; marital status; parents' highest education; single parent status; type of high school credential (diploma, GED, none); intensity of attendance (full-time for a fullyear or less); the number of hours worked while enrolled; the amount of financial aid received; whether students entered postsecondary education immediately after high school graduation;37 the type of postsecondary institution initially attended; and the extent of the students' involvement in their first year of academic life. Unfortunately, due to the postsecondary focus of the BPS survey with the exception of the type of high school credential (GED versus diploma), variables related to early academic preparation and high school curricula, which have been shown to be strongly associated with postsecondary persistence and attainment, were not available for inclusion in the model. The adjusted proportions of students pursuing a bachelor's degree who were continuously enrolled through spring 1992 are shown in table 13. Once all the variables were held constant, four factors were no longer significantly related to persistence: age (under 24 or older), single parent status, high school credential type, and immediate entry 35Given the substantial limitations imposed by the small sample sizes of minority groups in the BPS survey, we could not control for these factors in a simple tabular analysis. 36An exploratory analysis that included a number of independent variables (identified in subsequent paragraphs) was initially conducted. Variables that were not significant were removed from the model, and the resulting regression coefficients for variables that significant were used to adjust the original estimates. 37\"Immediately after high school graduation\" means within 1 year of high school graduation.

While these four variables have been shown to be individually associated with reduced persistence and attainment rates, students with these attributes (i.e., students who are older, single parents, those who delayed entry into postsecondary education, and recipients of GED credentials) are also more likely to attend community colleges rather than 4-year institutions and to attend on a part-time basis.38 Therefore, when these related variables were included in the model, the age-related factors were no longer significant. There were a number of variables related to students' educational activities that were positively associated with continuous enrollment toward a bachelor's degree when all other variables were held constant. For example, if students attended full time during their entire first year in college, they were more likely to persist than were students attending less time. Students who worked part time while they were enrolled in their first year fared better than those who worked full time as did students who reported more active involvement in their academic life when compared with those who reported never participating in academic activities outside of class. The amount of financial aid received in 1989-90 also made a difference in persistence, with students receiving $5,000 or more persisting at higher rates than those who received less. On the other hand, there was no difference in persistence rates for students who initially enrolled in a private, not-for-profit 4-year institution compared with those enrolled in public 4-year institutions. Family background characteristics such as income and parents' education were related to persistence in expected ways: students from high income families persisted better than those from middle income families and students whose parents were college graduates persisted better than did students whose parents had no more than a high school education. Finally, the demographic variables that made a difference in persistence were gender, with female students more likely to persist than males, and marital status, with unmarried students being more likely to persist than married students. After controlling for all the variables that were associated with persistence, the relationship among racialethnic groups with respect to their persistence rates changed to some degree. For example, compared with white, non-Hispanic students, Asian/Pacific Islander students pursuing a bachelor's degree were more likely to be continuously enrolled through spring 1992, while black, non-Hispanic students were less likely to be so. Persistence for Hispanic students, on the other hand, did not differ significantly from that of white, non-Hispanic students. Moreover, the adjusted persistence rate for Hispanic students showed a substantial increase (46 percent to 55 percent for those who were 38Sec U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, High School and Beyond, continuously enrolled). Two possible explanations for this increase may be that Hispanic students pursuing a bachelor's degree are much more likely to initially enroll in a 2-year institution (45 percent compared with 19 percent of white, non-Hispanic students), and that they are less likely to be enrolled full time for a full year (40 percent compared with 64 percent of white, non-Hispanic students).39 When these factors, which are known to negatively influence persistence to a bachelor's degree, were controlled for the persistence rate for Hispanic students increased.  -Sample size too small for reliable estimate.

This included students who may have left school and subsequently reenrolled before the month of May in ei 'her 1985 or 1992.

Student was an immediate entrant into PSE The need for a nationally representative database on postsecondary student financial aid prompted the U.S. Department of Education to conduct the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, a survey conducted every three years beginning in 1987. The NPSAS sample was designed to include students enrolled in all types of postsecondary education. Thus, it included students enrolled in public institutions; private, not-for-profit institutions; and private, for-profit institutions. The sample included students at 4-year and 2-year institutions, as well as students enrolled in occupationally specific programs that lasted for less than 2 years.

A follow-up was conducted 2 years after the NPSAS:90 survey that obtained information concerning enrollment, program completion, education financing, employment, and family formation; expectations for graduate school; participation in additional education (provided by an employer or other non-postsecondary provider); family income and expenditure; goals and aspirations; and civic participation. The data derived from this survey permit a variety of analyses concerning postsecondary persistence and completion, entry into the work force, and civic participation. NPSAS:90 included a stratified sample of approximately 69,000 eligible students (about 47,000 of whom were undergraduates) from about 1,100 institutions. Students were included in the sample if they attended a NPSAS-eligible institution; were enrolled between July 1, 1989 and June 30, 1990; and were enrolled in one or more courses or programs including courses for credit, a degree or formal award program of at least 3 months' duration, or an occupationally or vocationally specific program of at least 3 months' duration. Regardless of their postsecondary status, however, students who were also enrolled in high school were excluded. For each of the students included in the NPSAS sample, there were up to three sources of data. First, institution registration and financial aid records were extracted. Second, a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) designed for each student was conducted. Finally, a CATI designed for the parents or guardians of a subsample of students was conducted. Data from these three sources were synthesized into a single system with an overall response rate of about 89 percent.

Comparisons based on the estimates of the proportions include the estimates of the probability of a Type I error, or significance level. The significance levels were determined by calculating the Student's t values for the differences between each pair of means or proportions and comparing these with published tables of significance levels for two-tailed hypothesis testing. The 1989-90 NPSAS survey, while representative and statistically accurate, was not a simple random sample. Instead, the survey sample was selected using a more complex three-step procedure with stratified samples and differential probabilities of selection at each level. First, postsecondary institutions were initially selected within geographical strata. Once institutions were organized by zip code and state, they were further stratified by control (i.e., public; private, not-for-profit; or private, for-profit) and offering (less-than-2-year, 2-to 3-year, 4-year non doctoral-granting, and 4-year doctoral-granting). Sampling rates for students enrolled at different institutions and levels (undergraduate or other) varied, resulting in better data for policy purposes, but at a cost to statistical efficiency. Student's t values may be computed for comparisons using these tables' estimates with the following formula: ii s312 se22where Pi and P2 are the estimates to be compared and sei and se2 are their corresponding standard errors. Note that this formula is valid only for independent estimates.

First, the test may make comparisons based on large t statistics appear to merit special attention. This can be misleading since the magnitude of the 1 statistic is related not only to the observed differences in means or percentages but also to the number of students in the specific categories used for comparison. Hence, a small difference compared across a large number of students would produce a large t statistic. A second hazard in reporting statistical tests for each comparison is making multiple comparisons among categories of an independent variable. For example, when making paired comparisons among different levels of income, the probability of a Type I error for these comparisons taken as a group is larger than the probability for a single comparison. When more than one difference between groups of related characteristics or \"families\" are tested for statistical significance, one must apply a standard that assures a level of significance for all of those comparisons taken together. Comparisons were made in this report only when p .05/k for a particular pairwise comparison, where that comparison was one of k tests within a family. This guarantees both that the individual comparison would have p 5 .05 and that when k comparisons were made within a family of possible tests, the significance level of the comparisons would sum to p .05.43 For example, in a comparison of the percentages of males and females who enrolled in postsecondary education only one comparison is possible (males v. females). In this family, k=1, and the comparison can be evaluated with a Student's t test. When students are divided into five racialethnic groups and all possible comparisons are made, then k = 10 and the significance level of each test must be p .05/10, or .005. The formula for calculating family size (k) is as follows: k = j * (j -1)/2, where j is the number of categories for the variable being tested. In the case of raceethnicity, there are five racialethnic groups (American Indian, Asian, black, Hispanic, and white), so k = 5*(5-1)/2=10."}, {"section_title": "Adjustments of means", "text": "Tabular results are limited by sample size when attempting to control for additional factors that may account for the variation observed between two variables. For example, when examining the percentages for those who persist in r ostsecondary education by raceethnicity, it is impossible to know to what extent the observed variation is due to raceethnicity and to what extent it is due to differences in other factors such as income, attendance status, and type of institution attended. However, if a 43The standard that p 5.05/k for each comparison is more stringent than the criterion that the significance level of the comparisons should sum to p 5.05.

For those cases where the sample size becomes too small to support controlling for another level of variation, one. must use other methods to take such variation into account. Adjusted values for subgroup populations were obtained by regressing the dependent variable on a set of descriptive variables such as, family income, race ethnicity, etc. The adjusted values were determined only for those independent variables that remained were in the model. That is, the model was 'reduced' by removing variables whose variance was accounted for by other variables. Once the model was reduced, substituting ones or zeros for the subgroup variable(s) and the mean proportions for the other variables results in an estimate of the adjusted proportion for some specified subgroup holding all other variables constant. For example, consider the case in which two variables, family income and raceethnicity, are used to describe continuous enrollment in a bachelors degree program. The variables family income and race ethnicity are recoded into two dummy variables representing family income and four dummy variables representing raceethnicity: To estimate the adjusted mean for any subgroup evaluation at the mean of all other variables, one substitutes the appropriate values for that subgroup's dummy variables (1 or 0) and the mean for the dummy variable(s) representing all other subgroups. For example, say we had a case where Y=persistence was being described by I1 through R4 (coded as shown above), and suppose the means for II through R4 are: To estimate the adjusted value for blacks, one substitutes the appropriate values for the intercept and each dummy variable. In this case the adjusted mean for black students is 0.5095 and represents the expected persistence rate for black students pursuing a bachelor's degree who were continuously enrolled and who look like the average student across all the other variables (in this example, income). It is relatively straightforward to produce a multivariate model using NPSAS:90 or BPS:90/92 data, since one of the output options of the DAS is a correlation matrix, computed using pair-wise missing values.44 This matrix can be used by most commercial regression packages as input for producing weighted least-square estimates of the parameters. That was the general approach used for this report, with two additional adjustments described below to reduce the effect of redundant parameters and to incorporate the design effect for statistical testing. Since many of the independent variables are interrelated (as previously discussed in the report), the presence of some variables in the model is redundant. That is, the variance explained by them will have been accounted for by other variables in the model. Accordingly, variables without explanatory power were removed, resulting in a reduced regression model. The reduced model was then used to produce the parameter estimates shown in the above formula. For example, the variable age is highly related to financial dependency status since one of the definitions of financial independence is being over the age of 24. Therefore, the variable age may account for the variation observed for dependency status when both variables are present in the model. In this case, the dependency status variable would be removed from the model. Most commercial regression packages compute parameter standard errors on the assumption of simple random sampling. For the data used in this report, this assumption is incorrect. A better approximation of their standard errors is to multiply each standard error by the DEFT of the dependent variable,45 where DEFT is the ratio of the true standard error to the standard error computed under the assumption of simple random sampling. It is calculated by the DAS and is available with the correlation matrix. 44Although the DAS simplifies the process of making regression models, it also limits the range of models. Analysts who wish to use different error assumptions than pairwisc or to estimate probit/logit models can apply for a restricted data license from NCES. 45The adjustment procedure and its limitations are described in the Analysis q1Complex Surveys, eds.
