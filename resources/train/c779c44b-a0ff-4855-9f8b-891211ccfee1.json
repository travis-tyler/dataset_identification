[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract: Multimodality based methods have shown great advantages in classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, that is, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Recently, multitask feature selection methods are typically used for joint selection of common features across multiple modalities. However, one disadvantage of existing multimodality based methods is that they ignore the useful data distribution information in each modality, which is essential for subsequent classification. Accordingly, in this paper we propose a manifold regularized multitask feature learning method to preserve both the intrinsic relatedness among multiple modalities of data and the data distribution information in each modality. Specifically, we denote the feature learning on each modality as a single task, and use groupsparsity regularizer to capture the intrinsic relatedness among multiple tasks (i.e., modalities) and jointly select the common features from multiple tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a new manifold-based Laplacian regularizer to preserve the data distribution information from each task. Finally, we use the Additional Supporting Information may be found in the online version of this article. multikernel support vector machine method to fuse multimodality data for eventual classification. Conversely, we also extend our method to the semisupervised setting, where only partial data are labeled. We evaluate our method using the baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) data of subjects from AD neuroimaging initiative database. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can not only achieve improved classification performance, but also help to discover the disease-related brain regions useful for disease diagnosis.

It is predicted that the number of affected people will double in the next 20 years, and 1 in 85 people will be affected by 2050 [Brookmeyer et al., 2007] . As AD-specific brain changes begin years before the patient becomes symptomatic, early clinical diagnosis of AD becomes a challenging task. Therefore, many studies focus on possible identification of such changes at the early stage, that is, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), by leveraging neuroimaging data [Jie et al., 2014a; Sui et al., 2012; Ye et al., 2011] .\nNeuroimaging is a powerful tool for disease diagnosis and also evaluation of therapeutic efficacy in neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD and MCI. Neuroimaging research offers great potential to discover features that can identify individuals early in the course of dementing illness. Recently, a number of machine learning and pattern classification methods have been widely used in neuroimaging analysis of AD and MCI, including both group comparison (i.e., between clinically different groups) and individual classification [Jie et al., 2014b; Orru et al., 2012; Ye et al., 2011] . Early studies mainly focus on extracting features [e.g., based on regions of interest (ROIs) or voxels] from single imaging modality such as structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [Chincarini et al., 2011; Fan et al., 2008a,b; Liu et al., 2012; Oliveira et al., 2010; Westman et al., 2011] and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) [Drzezga et al., 2003; Foster et al., 2007; Higdon et al., 2004; Hinrichs et al., 2009] , and so forth. More recently, researchers have begun to integrate multiple imaging modalities to further improve the accuracy of disease diagnosis [Hinrichs et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2013] .\nIn many clinical and research studies, it is common to acquire multiple imaging modalities for a more accurate and rigorous assessment of disease status and progression. In fact, different imaging modalities provide different views of brain function or structure. For example, structural MRI provides information about the tissue type of brain, while FDG-PET measures the cerebral metabolic rate for glucose. It is reported that MRI and FDG-PET measures provide different sensitivity to memory between disease and health [Walhovd et al., 2010b] . Intuitively, integration of multiple modalities may uncover the previously hidden information that cannot be found using any single modality. In the literature, a number of studies have exploited the fusion of multiple modalities to improve AD or MCI classification performance [Apostolova et al., 2010; Dai et al., 2012; Foster et al., 2007; Huang et al., 2011; Landau et al., 2010; Yuan et al., 2012] . For example, Hinrichs et al. [2011] and Liu et al. [2014] proposed to combine MRI and FDG-PET for AD classification. Zhang et al. [2011] combined three modalities, that is, MRI, FDG-PET, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), to discriminate AD/MCI and normal controls (NCs). Gray et al., [2013] extracted features including regional MRI volume, voxel-based FDG-PET signal intensities, CSF biomarker measures, and categorical genetic information for diagnosis of AD/MCI. Existing studies have indicated that different imaging modalities can provide essential complementary information that can improve accuracy in disease diagnosis when used together.\nFor imaging modalities, even after feature extraction (usually from brain regions), there may still exist redundant or irrelevant features. So, feature selection, which can be considered as the biomarker identification for AD and MCI, is commonly used to remove these redundant or irrelevant features. However, due to the complexity of brain and the disease, it is challenging to detect all relevant diseaserelated features (i.e., regional features) from a single modality, especially in the early stage of the disease. Different imaging modalities may provide essential complementary information that can help identify these dysfunctional regions implicated by the same underlying pathology. In addition, recent studies also show that there is overlap between the disease-related brain regions detected by MRI and FDG-PET, respectively, such as regions in the hippocampus and the mesia temporal lobe [Huang et al., 2011] . Some feature selection techniques (e.g., t-test) have been used for identifying the disease-related regions from each single modality data [Wee et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2011] . However, an obvious disadvantage of these techniques is that they do not consider the intrinsic relatedness between features across different modalities. Recently, a few studies have exploited to jointly select features from multimodality neuroimaging data for AD/MCI classification. For example, Huang et al. [2011] proposed to jointly identify diseaserelated brain features from multimodality data, using sparse composite linear discrimination analysis method. Zhang and Shen [2012] proposed a multimodal multitask learning for joint feature selection for AD classification. Liu et al. [2014] embedded intermodality constraint into multitask learning framework for AD/MCI classification. However, a disadvantage of those methods is that the distribution information of each modality data is ignored, which may affect the final classification performance.\nAccordingly, in this article, as motivated by the work in , we proposed a new multitaskbased joint feature learning framework, which considers both the intrinsic relatedness among multimodality data and the distribution information of each modality data. Specifically, we formulated the classification of multimodality data as a multitask learning (MTL) problem, where each task denotes the classification based on individual modality of data. The aim of MTL is to improve the generalization performance by jointly learning a set of related tasks. Learning multiple related tasks simultaneously has been shown to often perform better than learning each task separately [Argyriou et al., 2008] . Specifically, two regularization items are included in the proposed model. The first item is the group-sparsity regularizer [Ng and Abugharbieh, 2011; Yuan and Lin, 2006] , which ensures only a small number of brain-region specific features to be jointly selected across different tasks (i.e., modalities). The second item is the manifold regularization item, which can preserve the distribution information of the whole data from each task (i.e., modality) and thus induce more discriminative features. Then, the multikernel support vector machine (SVM) technique is adopted to fuse multimodality data for classifying individuals with AD/MCI from NCs. Furthermore, we extend our method to the semisupervised setting (i.e., learning from both labeled and unlabeled data), which is of great importance in practice as the acquisition of labeled data (i.e., diagnosis of disease) is usually expensive and time-consuming, while the collection of unlabeled data is relatively much easier. To the best of our knowledge, no previous learning models could ever incorporate both the group-sparsity and the manifold regularization terms into the same objective function, for which we further develop a new efficient algorithm.\nTo validate the efficacy of our method, two sets of experiments, that is, supervised and semisupervise classification, are performed on 202 subjects with the baseline MRI and FDG-PET data from Alzheimer Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI), which includes 51 AD patients, 99 MCI patients, and 52 NCs. In both sets of experiments, we built multiple binary classifiers, that is, AD versus NC, MCI versus NC, and MCI converters (MCI-C) versus MCI nonconverters (MCI-NC), respectively. The experiment results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. Figure 1 illustrates the proposed classification framework, which includes three main steps: image preprocessing and feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. In this section, we will give the detailed descriptions of these steps. Before that, we will first introduce the subjects used in this article."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "The data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from ADNI database. The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the Food and Drug Administration, private pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-year public-private partnership. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether the serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials.\nADNI is the result of efforts of many coinvestigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the US and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 adults, aged 55-90, to participate in the research-approximately 200 cognitively normal older individuals to be followed for 3 years, 400 people with MCI to be followed for 3 years, and 200 people with early AD to be followed for 2 years (see www.adni-info. org for up-to-date information). In current studies, we used a total of 202 subjects with corresponding baseline MRI and PET data, which includes 51 AD patients, 99 MCI patients (including 43 MCI converters and 56 MCI nonconverters), and 52 NC.

Specifically, we use the specific application tool for image preprocessing as similarly used in [Wang et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2011] , that is, spatial distortion, skull-stripping, and removal of cerebellum. Then, for structural MR images, we use the FSL package [Zhang et al., 2001 ] to segment each image into three different tissues: gray matter (GM), white matter, and CSF. With atlas warping, each subject was partitioned into 93 ROIs [Shen and Davatzikos, 2002] . For each ROI, the volume of GM tissue in that ROI was computed as a feature. For FDG-PET images, we use a rigid transformation to align it onto its respective MR image of the same subject, and then compute the average intensity of each ROI in the FDG-PET image as a feature. Overall, by performing this series of image preprocessing, for each subject we can acquire 93 features from the MRI image and another 93 features from the PET image. We normalize the features of each modality with the same normalization scheme as used in ."}, {"section_title": "Manifold Regularized Multitask Feature Selection", "text": "Multitask learning aims to improve the performance of learning algorithms by jointly learning a set of related tasks [Argyriou et al., 2008; Obozinski et al., 2010] , which is particularly useful when these tasks have some commonality and are generally slightly under sampled. Based on multitask learning framework, Zhang and Shen [2012] proposed a feature learning method to jointly predict the multiple regression and classification variables from multimodality data, and achieved state-of-the-art performance in AD classification. Motivated by their work, we proposed a new multitask feature learning framework to jointly detect the disease-related regions from multimodality data for classification. We first briefly introduce the existing multitask feature learning method.

The use of l 2;1 -norm encourages the weight matrices with many zero rows. For feature selection, only those features with nonzero coefficients are kept. In other words, this norm combines multiple tasks and ensures that a small number of common features be jointly (1) reduces to the l 1 -norm regularized optimization problem in the least absolution shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) [Tibshirani, 1996 ] when the number of tasks equals to one."}, {"section_title": "Manifold regularized MTFS (M2TFS)", "text": "In the MTFS model, a linear mapping function (i.e., f(x) 5 w T x) was adopted to transform the data from the original high-dimensional space to one-dimensional space.

Figure 2 illustrates an example. Let's consider a pair of mapped data points y 1 and y 2 in Figure 2 . Intuitively, these two points should be closer, as they come from the same class.\nTo address this issue, we introduced a new regularization item as:\nwhere S m 5\u00bds m ij denotes a similarity matrix that defines the similarity on task m across different subjects. \nwhere b and g are two positive constants.

(2) to explore the geometric distribution information of original data for training a better learning model under semisupervised setting. Therefore, we extend our model to semisupervised version as follows.\nWe first define a diagonal matrix P 2 R N3N to indicate labeled and unlabeled data, that is, P ii 50 if the class label of subject i is unknown, and P ii 51 otherwise.

In both sets of experiments, multiple binary classifiers, that is, AD versus NC, MCI versus NC, and MCI converters (MCI-C) versus MCI nonconverters (MCI-NC), are built, respectively. For classification, a linear SVM was implemented based on the LIBSVM library [Chang and Lin, 2001] with the default value for regularization parameter (i.e., C 5 1). For evaluation of the proposed method, we adopt the classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) as performance measures.

Specifically, our proposed M2TFS method achieves the classification accuracy of 95.03, 79.27, and 68.94% for AD versus NC, MCI versus NC, and MCI-C versus MCI-NC, respectively, while the best classification accuracy of other methods are 92.25, 74.34, and 61.67%, respectively. Also, M2TFS is consistently superior to other methods in sensitivity measure. High sensitivity is very important for the purpose of diagnosis, because there are different costs for misclassifying a normal person to be a patient or misclassifying a patient to be a healthy person. Obviously, compared with the former, the latter may cause more severe consequences and thus has higher misclassification cost. Hence, it is advantageous for a classifier to provide higher sensitivity rate. In addition, the AUC of proposed method, respectively, is 0.97, 0.82, and 0.70 for those classifications, which indicates excellent diagnostic power. The results in Table II show that our proposed M2TFS method can take advantage of the local neighboring structure information of same-class data to seek out the most discriminative subset of features. Besides, we performed the significance test between classification accuracy of our proposed and those of compared methods, using the standard paired t-test.

Moreover, the intervals with higher performance mainly lie in a larger interval of [0.2, 0.8], implying that each modality is indispensable for achieving good classification performance.

A main aim of multimodality method is to access the joint information provided by multiple imaging technique, which in turn can be useful for identifying the dysfunctional regions implicated many brain disorders [Sui et al., 2012] . Recent emergence of multitask learning approach makes it possible to jointly identify and select features from different modalities. Our study demonstrated that, using multitask learning and embedding the distribution information of data, the proposed method can achieve a significantly improved performance for disease classification.\nThe regions involved in the course of AD/MCI classification by the proposed method are in agreement with previous studies. For example, hippocampal formation, which is thought to play an important role in memory, spatial navigation and control of attention, is one of the first brain regions to suffer damage with memory loss and disorientation. Researchers have found that the hippocampal formation is damaged heavily in AD, and is a focal point for pathology [Hyman et al., 1984; Van Hoesen and Hyman, 1990; Wolf et al., 2003] . The amygdala plays a primary role in the processing of memory, decision-making and emotional reactions. Existing studies have shown this as another important subcortical region that is severely and consistently affected by pathology in AD [Dai et al., 2009; Knafo et al., 2009; Poulin et al., 2011] . In addition, group comparison based studies demonstrate significant abnormalities in parahippocampal gyrus [Solodkin et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2012] , uncus [Laakso et al., 2000] , temporal pole [Nobili et al., 2008] , entorhinal cortex [Derflinger et al., 2011] , precuneus [Del Sole et al., 2008; Karas et al., 2007] , and angular [Hunt et al., 2006] . The fact that our results are consistent with the previous studies demonstrates that our proposed method can also help discover the disease-related brain regions useful for disease diagnosis."}, {"section_title": "Multimodality Classification", "text": "Recent studies on AD and MCI have shown that biomarkers from different modalities contain complementary information for diagnosis of AD [Apostolova et al., 2010; Foster et al., 2007; Landau et al., 2010; Walhovd et al., 2010b] . Several studies on combining different modalities of biomarkers have been reported for multimodality classification [Bouwman et al., 2007; Chetelat et al., 2005; Fan et al., 2008a,b; Sokolova, 1991; Vemuri et al., 2009; Walhovd et al., 2010a; Wee et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2010] , achieving better performance than baseline singlemodality methods. Two different strategies were often used in those methods, that is, (1) combining all features from different modalities into a longer feature vector for the following classification and (2) using MKL technique for multimodality data fusion and classification. Empirical results have shown that the latter often can achieve better classification performance than the former. To evaluate the effect of combining multimodality data, we performed two additional experiments, that is, (1) using more modalities and (2) using only single modality. In the first experiment, besides MRI and PET modalities, we also included the CSF data (with Ab42, t-tau and p-tau as features) using our proposed classification framework. Specifically, we combined three modalities data (i.e., MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF) for classification [denoted as M2TFS (MRI1PET1CSF)]. While in the second experiment, for each modality, we performed LASSO-based feature selection, and then used SVM with linear kernel for classification (denoted as MRI, PET and CSF, respectively). It is worth noting that feature selection was not necessary for CSF modality in both experiments. The corresponding experimental results are summarized in Table VI . Here, the proposed M2TFS with two modalities (i.e., MRI and FDG-PET) is denoted as M2TFS (MRI1PET).\nAs we can see from Table VI , our proposed method with three modalities [i.e., M2TFS (MRI1PET1CSF)] achieves the best classification performance, compared with that with two modalities [i.e., M2TFS (MRI1PET)] and those with single modality (i.e., PET, MRI, and CSF). Also, Table VI shows that the performance of combining two modalities is better than that of using only single modality. These results further validate that different modalities of data contain complementary information, and the advantages of multimodality based methods over single-modality based ones.\nConversely, in Table VII we also compare our proposed method with the recent state-of-the-art methods for multimodality based AD/MCI classification. As we can see from Table VII , compared with all other methods, our method achieves the best classification accuracy, which again validates the efficacy of our proposed method.\nIn the current studies, multitask learning technique is used to learn a set of related features from multimodality data for improving the classification performance. As multitask learning can use the related auxiliary information among tasks, it often leads to a better learning model, compared to single-task learning. Several studies have used multitask learning for disease classification and prediction. For example, Yuan et al. [2012] also used multitask learning framework for classification of incomplete multimodality of data. Zhang and Shen [2012] adopted multitask learning framework for joint prediction of multiple regression and classification variables. Zhou et al. [2013] formulated the prediction problem as a multitask regression problem by considering the prediction at each time point as a task. More recently, Liu et al. [2014] also adopted multitask feature learning framework for AD/MCI classification, by adding the intermodality constraint into its objective function. However, different from Liu et al.'s method, our proposed method simultaneously adopted groupsparsity regularizer (for joint feature selection from multimodality data) and embed the distribution information of data into the learning model. The experimental results in Table VII show that our method can achieve a better classification performance than Liu et al.'s method [Liu et al., 2014] ."}, {"section_title": "The Effect of Distinct Similarity Measures", "text": "In the proposed method, two different similarity measures are adopted, which are defined in Eqs. (3) and (5), respectively. The former was used to preserve the local neighboring structure of same-class data during the mapping, while the latter was used to preserve the geometrical distribution information of original data. To evaluate the effects of both similarity measures, we perform two additional experiments. Specifically, in supervised setting, we first performed the proposed M2TFS method with the Tables VIII and  IX , the M2TFS method achieves better performance than M2TFS-S5 method, and semi-M2TFS-Mix method achieves better performance than semi-M2TFS, which indicate that M2TFS and semi-M2TFS-Mix can both obtain more discriminative features (i.e., ROIs), as the similarity defined in Eq. (3) embeds the discriminative information of data."}, {"section_title": "The Effect of Regularization Parameters", "text": "In our proposed M2TFS method, it includes two regularization items, that is, the group-sparsity regularizer and the manifold regularization term. The parameters b and g balance the relative contribution of those regularization terms. To investigate the effects of the regularization parameters b and g on the classification performance of our proposed method, we test different values for b, ranging from 0 to 25 at a step size of 5, and also test different values for g, ranging from 0 to 50 at a step size of 5. Figure 7 shows the classification results with respect to different values of b and g. It is worth noting that, when b50, no feature selection step is performed, that is, all features extracted from MRI and FDG-PET data are used for classification. So our method will be degraded to a multimodality method as proposed in (i.e., MM method). Also, when g50, no manifold regularization item is included, and thus our method will be degraded to a MTFS method.\nAs we can observe from Figure 7 , under all values of b and g, our proposed M2TFS method consistently outperforms the MTFS methods on three classification groups (i.e., AD vs. NC, MCI vs. NC and MCI-C vs. MCI-NC), which further indicates the advantage of adding the manifold regularization term. Also, Figure 7 show that, when fixing the value of b, the varied curves with the values of g are very smooth on three classification groups, which shows that our method is very robust to the regularization parameter g. Finally, we can see from Figure 7 that, when fixing the value of g, the results on three classification groups are largely affected with different values of b, which implies that the selection of b is very important for the final classification results. This is reasonable as b controls the sparsity of model and thus determines the size of the optimal feature subset."}, {"section_title": "Manifold Learning and Semisupervised learning", "text": "Manifold learning is a recent machine learning technique, which pursuits the goal to embed the original data in a high-dimensional space into a lower dimensional space, while preserving the characteristic properties of the original data. As manifold learning enables dimensionality reduction and processing tasks in a meaningful lower-dimensional space, it has been successfully applied to lots of tasks. In the community of machine learning, semisupervised learning based on manifold has been extensively studied and applied [Belkin and Niyogi, 2004; Zhu and Goldberg, 2009] . A few recent studies have applied manifold learning to medical imaging analysis [Aljabar et al., 2008; Guerrero et al., 2011; Wachinger and Navab, 2012; Wolz et al., 2012] .\nSemisupervised learning is a class of learning tasks that can make use of both labeled and unlabeled data for learning, where typically a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data are available. Existing studies have shown that a model can produce considerable improvement in learning performance when using unlabeled data together with a small amount of labeled data. The acquisition of labeled data is usually expensive and time-consuming as it often requires a skilled human agent or a physical experiment, while the collection of unlabeled data is relatively easier. So, semisupervised learning is of great importance in practice. Among semisupervised learning methods, a promising family of techniques is to exploit the \"manifold structure\" of the data, which is generally based on the assumption that similar unlabeled subjects should be given the same classification [Zhu and Goldberg, 2009] . A few studies have applied semisupervised learning to medical imaging analysis [Dittrich et al., 2014] . For example, Filipovych and Davatzikos [2011] applied the semisupervised learning for classifying MCI subjects into MCI converters (MCI-C) and MCI nonconverters (MCI-NC) using semisupervised SVM method with 63 normal and 54 AD subjects as labeled data and 416 MCI subjects (including 242 MCI-C and 174 MCI-NC) as unlabeled data.\nConversely, in the proposed semi-M2TFS method, we computed the classification performance on both the labeled data used for testing (i.e., testing data) and all the unlabeled data. However, in practice, it may be a better strategy to compute the classification accuracy using only the testing data (i.e., excluding all unlabeled data), as, for the latter, the training data and the testing data are completely independent, and thus the predictive model can be prelearned using the training data and then used directly to make prediction for the new subjects. Therefore, we recompute the classification accuracy using only the testing data, and the results show that our proposed method achieves the classification accuracy of 90.13, 74.99, and 60.04% for AD versus NC, MCI versus NC, and MCI-C versus MCI-NC, respectively, which are comparable to the corresponding results of semi-M2TFS in Table V . These results again validate the efficacy of our proposed method."}, {"section_title": "Limitation", "text": "The current study is limited by several factors. First, in the current study, we only investigated binary-class classification problem (i.e., AD vs. NC, MCI vs. NC, and MCI-C vs. MCI-NC), but did not test the ability of the classifier for the multiclass classification of AD, MCI, and NCs. Second, the proposed method is based on multimodality data (i.e., FDG-PET and MRI) and requires each subject having all corresponding modalities of data, which limits the size of subjects that can be used for study. Finally, other modalities of data (for example genetic data) can also be used for further improving the classification performance. In the future work, we will address the above limitations to further improve the performance of classification."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "In summary, this article addresses the problem of exploiting the distribution information of data to build the multitask feature learning method for jointly selecting features from multimodalities of data. By introducing the manifold regularization term into the multitask learning framework, we used the APG algorithm to solve the optimal problem for seeking out the most informative feature subset. We have also developed the manifold regularized MTFS method for both supervised and semisupervised cases, with the corresponding algorithms denoted as M2TFS and semi-M2TFS, respectively. Different from the existing MTFS methods, our method uses the distribution knowledge of data for early diagnosis of AD with better results. Experimental results on the ADNI dataset validate the efficacy of our proposed method."}]
