Data collected from federal and states governments to understand situation among schools. This study finds that inequality among schools is caused mainly by discrimination against the poor and minorities. The current education system reinforces social stratification because of unequal resources. The issue of unequal education has shifted not from race to class but race to race, ''social minority'' and class, ''economic minority.'' KEYWORDS: Minority, Equity, Equality, Social Stratification, and Education"}, {"section_title": "I. Introduction: The Problem of Its Setting", "text": "Whereas 44.6% of the poor have less than a high school education, only 6.7% of the poor receive four year or more of post-secondary education in the United States (Blank 1997, p. 17) . This fact indicates clearly that the education level strongly correlates with socioeconomic status (SES). If one wants to realize upward mobility, receiving a college degree is one of the strongest ways of him or her to do so. However, it is not easy for the poor to reach the start line. One of the reasons is the current education system. Unfortunately, equity and equal educational opportunity have not been realized even after the civil rights and the feminist movement.\nMy hypothesis in this paper is as follows:\n(1) Current education system in the United States reinforces social stratification.\n(2) The reason is that current education system distributes resources unequally.\n(3) The issue of unequal education has shifted from race to class. In order to analyze these hypotheses, relationship between education and poverty is explained to understand social stratification in the United States. Additionally, the structure which students from low income families cannot go to college is analyzed based on data in Maryland. Finally, one will make recommendations for increased equality and equity in education to counter social stratification.\nThe general framework of this paper is based on the Stein Rokkan's theory (1971) . It is obvious that the ''minorities matter'' is structural problem when one ponders upon his original a-g-i-l scheme. The principle of equality and equity are discussed based on John Rawls' theory. According to Rawls, -in order to treat all persons equally, to provide genuine equality of opportunity, society must give more attention to those with fewer native assets and to those born into the less favorable social positions (Rawls 1971, p. 100 ). Thus, the principle of equity is that no group of people is less important than another. Equity focuses on equal outcome whereas equality focuses on equal distribution."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Data", "text": "When one collected data based on federal, states, and local governments in 2003 and 2004, not only economic categories but also racial categories have focused because of third hypothesis. One focused only on whites and African Americans since there are three reasons. First, African American still comprises the largest racial group among minorities in my research area, Maryland. Second, African Americans have the longest history among minorities in the United States. Third, only African American were involuntary immigrants who were taken against their will defined by Ogbu (1978) . Thus, one selected two areas in Maryland: Montgomery County dominated by whites and Prince George's County dominated by African American."}, {"section_title": "Survey Data", "text": "In the contemporary United States, legal-rational authority such as politics has more responsibility than voluntary organizations such as religion for the reality of social stratification. In order to think about how voluntary organizations can help the oppressed group, two social researches are conducted-participant observations and key informant interviews with principals, teachers, and students. (Shiratori 1994) . Through the empirical studies with Henry Valen (1964) , he came to be aware of the importance of the cleavages and his theory became systematic in his article (1965) and his extended article with Seymour Martin Lipset (1967) . The 1965 article is important, because it was in this article that the original four cleavages, which have become the core of his political theory in the later development, first appeared.\nIn the 1965 article, Rokkan first identified the cleavages which would characterize his political theory; and by using it, he explained the party systems which have appeared in the political development of Western Europe along the cleavages from the comparative perspectives in a systematic way. This line of argument involves the historical diachronical phases as a matter of course. It is the first comparative analysis of that kind.\n1 ''Cleavage'' is often mentioned in literature concerning political parties. Then, can we say that there are no cleavages in the two-party U. S. social system because there is no expression of minority parties? The answer is definitely no. There are cleavages in the U. S. social system as well. The notion ''cleavage'' is not always accompanied by the political parties. Political parties are one type of the many forms of expression of sub-cultures which generate cleavages. Cleavages express some structuralized forms of conflict between sub-cultures in a political system.\nRokkan developed a systematic cleavage model by applying the Parsons' A-G-I-L scheme to focus the translation of conflicts into party systems (Rokkan 1967, p. 5 ). Rokkan used the scheme for its characteristics of the general theory and wide range of application to explain Parson's division of four functions which appears in the social structure of Western Europe. By applying Parsons' scheme, his political theory has an enormous expandability; and in his second period he developed ''a conceptual map of Europe'' (Shiratori 1994) . He molded these cleavages from the evaluation of the backgrounds of the conflicts and stepped into the internal classification of the I quadrant to explain the formation of parties and party constellations in mass democracies.\nRokkan applied the A-G-I-L scheme to develop his own a-g-i-l scheme ( Fig. 1 ). In his model the original Parsonian dichotomies have been translated into continuous coordinates. The l-g line represents a Periphery-Center Axis which is territorial dimension of the national cleavage structure, and the a-i line represents the Cross-Local Functional (Economical-Cultural) Axis which is a functional dimension.\nBased on this a-g-i-l scheme, the basic four cleavages model has been formed (Lipset and Rokkan 1967, pp. 9-14) . These cleavages are structural products of two historically successive revolutions which took part in Western Europe: the National and Industrial Revolution. The first two cultural cleavages, the conflict between the central nation-building culture and the increasing resistance of the ethnically, linguistically, or religiously distinct subject populations in the Rokkan, op. cit., 1967, p. 14, modification by Shiratori. provinces and the peripheries (Subject vs. Dominant Culture): the conflict between the centralizing, standardizing, and mobilizing Nation-State and the historically established corporate privileges of the church (Church(es) vs. Government), are the product of National revolution. The latter two, the conflict between the landed interests and the rising class of industrial entrepreneurs (Primary vs. Secondary Economy): the conflict between owners and employers on the one side and tenants, laborers, and workers on the other (Workers vs. Employers, Owners), are products of the Industrial Revolution (Heider og Berntzen 1993, s.696). In the 1965 article Rokkan states the same thing (Rokkan 1965, s.696) . It is important to note that he has defined these four critical cleavages in a form which emphasizes the minorities. In this sense, this typology of the cleavages is more than just a taxonomy; rather we may see it as a democratic model by posing the pluralistic multipolar competitive social system model which is protecting the political minority. There, his strong awareness of minority issues is apparent. This line of argument led him to formulate the ''freezing'' hypothesis which argues that ''the party systems of the 1960's reflect, with few but significant exceptions, the cleavage structures of the 1920's'' with Lipset (Lipset and Rokkan 1967) .\nIn Rokkan's political theory, he synthesized minority conflicts comprehensively, and brought a new paradigm to the democratic theories. It can be said that up to then, there was no systematic equivalent contribution to the comprehensive view of social systems with an eye on minority protection other than his theory. All policy scientists should pay attention to his legacy, since the protection of the minority is the one of the biggest problems of this century. His theory is still influencing us (Lane and Ersson 1994 ). Rokan's theory of cleavages clearly exemplifies the fact that historical conflicts that have not been overridden and remain significant issues.\nIII. Result (Table 1) . One of the reasons is political-economic policies defined by Harper and Leight (2002) . They describe two types: the Anglo-American model and the continental-European model. The former ''creates lots of jobs, many lousy wages, with huge pools of poverty at the bottom and huge pools of wealth at the top,'' and the latter ''create fewer jobs but better ones and relies state to redistribute sufficient benefits to people and groups to preserve social peace'' (Harper and Leight 2002, p. 63) . Hence, it is easier to find a job but more difficult to earn enough money to live in the United States than it is in Europe. African American single parent families' poverty is more serious than whites' because it involves the cycle of poverty (Blank 1997) .\nAlthough African American in Prices George's County (90.4%) graduated from high school more than whites (83.0%), African Americans' median incomes are lower than those of whites (Tables 2 and 3 ). One big difference between two races is post secondary education. As MaCall (2000) states, ''The new inequality is often characterized by the increasing wage gap between workers with a college education and those without '' (MaCall 2000, p. 234) . Because of declining manual labor caused by exodus of factories from urban cities to the suburbs or outside of the nation and growing high skill service industries, there is less chance for people who do not have college degrees to find jobs (MaCall 2001, p. 522 and 524). "}, {"section_title": "Inequality among Schools", "text": "When one compares 10th grade reading test results in 2004, nearly half of students (44.5%) are defined as advanced in Montgomery whereas nearly half of the students (48.2%) are basic in Prince George's County (Table 4) . Prince George's County has promoted education reform called ''reconstitution'' such as teacher's discharge and hiring by the screening committee since 1997 (Tsuneyoshi, 2000) . However, its effort does not make an impact on the reading test results. One of the important reasons is public school revenue resources. Most public school revenue sources are local and state budget rather than federal. In Maryland, 56.4% is from local revenue, 37.2% is from state, and only 6.4% is from federal (NCED 2004-341, p. 8) . In this situation, school revenues are affected by local or state budget, and as a result wealthy areas spend a lot whereas poor areas cannot. There is unequal spending not only among areas but also within areas. Condron and Roscigno (2003) point out that there is unequal spending of local and state budget within districts. They found that low-SES parents cannot influence political entities, and proposals from low-SES area schools are not accepted because their principals do not have power. (Condron and Roscigno 2003, p. 29) . In addition, students in high poverty schools and high minority schools are more often taught by out-of-field teachers who have neither a major nor certification in the subject they are assigned to teach (NCES 2004 (NCES -076 2004 .\nNational Education Longitudinal Study shows data on which 10th grade students expect to go to college despite their SES and race (NECS 2004-076, p. 137) . Therefore if all students who want to go to college can attend, college attendance rate should not differ depending on SES or income. Since unequal public school revenue resources and instruction, students from low income families cannot earn test score and, as a result, cannot go to college even if they aspire to. Churches work as a bridge between politics and people in the community. For example, in Boston, the homicide rate dramatically declined in the 1990s because black churches cooperated with police and organized juvenile (Winship and Berrien 2002) . Churches as voluntary organizations can provide students from low income families not only role models and work ethics but also quality education. According to the survey data, the religious schools as voluntary organizations can function to connect people to legal-rational authority, the government; however, it has limitations. First of all, there is no enough room for all students who need help. In addition, the schools select students whom they can teach easily. Mainly reason is their budget which they manage their projects by donations. Although voluntary organizations make contribution to help oppressed group, it cannot be a main authority but be an alternative organization.\nIV. Analysis and Discussion: Reform Policies"}, {"section_title": "Reform Plan for Educational Equality", "text": "Even though religious schools help some people to realize social upward mobility, it cannot do for all people who need help. Hence, the government should reform educational policies. One of the biggest problems is an unequally funded system since public school education relies strongly on local taxes. Therefore, education should be funded not by local government but by federal government. The other possible solution is school choice whereby parents may choose a public school other than their assigned public school. According to NCES data, more African American parents (24.0%) favor school choice than do white parents (18.3%). One-parent households (18.3%) choose it more than two-parent household (14.1%). Poor parents (18.4%) choose it more than do non-poor parents (14.0%). Parents who do not have high school diplomas (19.7%) choose it more than those with bachelor's degrees (13.7%) and graduate or professional degrees (14.1%) (NECS 2004-076, p. 155) . Although parents cannot send their children from their district to a wealthy district under the current system, it would be helped if they could send their children to a school out of their district. The reentry system for dropouts is also working well. Brinton (1993) defines two types of human capital development system. One is a condensed system such as European countries which forces people to choose their life course within a particular age range. The other is a diffuse system which allows people to reshape their life at any age. American society is the latter (Brinton, 1993, p. 79) . This system gives all Americans a chance to go to college despite their age. Although a young person who is age-for-grade ''should'' graduate from college at age 22, in 1994, one-quarter of Americans aged 22-24 and 10 percent aged 25-29 were still enrolled in school (Bruno and Curry, 1996) ."}, {"section_title": "Reform Plan for Educational Equity", "text": "Realization of educational equality is not enough to open opportunity for every student to have access to a college education. Initially, students from low income families have to make more effort to catch up with their peers than do middle or upper class students because they have to adapt to middle class culture from which most teachers come in order to make progress in their subjects (Delpit 1997, p. 584) . Additionally, students from low income areas do not have quality community and academic environment. Emerson et al. (2001) point out that there is still racial residential segregation in the United States (Emerson et al., 2001) . Orr (2003) concludes that one cannot discuss equal education without different wealth between African American and whites. Finally, American society still needs to compensate for black history because of the long term, consequences of slavery (Moynihan, 1965) . Wilson (1996) and Kozol (1991) point out that the reason why African American families tend to create single families, especially single mother families, is economic. Ogbu (1978) also points out that the legacy of slavery and discrimination in America has created a perception that opportunities are closed off to African American. If so, single mother's problem is not a private problem but a social problem which it is the responsibility of society to solve.\nIn order to realize educational equity, federal government should provide more money to poor states and local governments than it does to wealthier ones. State government should allocate more money to local governments, and local government should distribute more money and more qualified teachers to schools in poverty areas. Educators should understand the fact that students from low income families and minority students cannot receive information the same as middle or upper middle classes and should try to minimize this information gap. "}, {"section_title": "V. Conclusion", "text": "The current education system which distributes resources unequally does not eliminate gap between the most power group and the least powerful, but, rather, it reinforce social stratification. The issue of unequal education has shifted not ''from race to class'' but ''from race to race and class.'' In order to realize a society in which people choose their future based only on their knowledge and aspiration, educational equality is at least necessary. Ideally, educational equity should be realized. Although equality and equity have almost the same meaning for the majority who can be satisfied with a ''one-size fits all,'' they are not same in the case of the minority who need special consideration. Realization of educational equity is not easy because it cannot be qualified in the same way as educational equality can be. In spite of the fact, it should be realized because getting quality education is the strong solutions to upward mobility for people who do not power. In addition, ''fraternity is held to represent a certain equality of social esteem manifest in various public conventions and in the absence of manners of deference and servility'' (Rawls 1971, p. 105) ."}, {"section_title": "Footnotes", "text": ""}]
