[{"section_title": "", "text": "Longitudinal SIS data were available for 23,915 participants who were cognitively normal at baseline (SIS > 4): 38% black, 43% female, mean age 64 years (SD=9.2) at enrollment, with an average follow-up of 5.9 years. Analyses of the SIS data indicate that those who did not use aspirin regularly have a higher likelihood of incident impairment on the SIS (SIS< 5 on most recent assessment) in univariate models (OR: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.13). However, after adjustment for demographic factors, the association between regular aspirin use and incident impairment on the SIS is no longer significant (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.89, 1.09). Additional inclusion of Framingham Stroke Risk total scores or individual factors did not change this finding. For separate analyses of cognitive change on the WLL, WLR, AFT and LF measures, difference scores were calculated based on each participant's first and last assessments on each measure, adjusted for initial score values. There were 12,231 participants with longitudinal WLL data: 35% black, 56% female, mean age 64 (SD=8.4), with an average follow-up of 3.6 years. In ANCOVA models the association between aspirin use and change in WLL score was significant before (Model 1), but not after adjustment for demographics (Model 2), or risk factors (Models 3 & 4). Analysis of the WLR data produced similar findings. To understand the reduction of association between aspirin use and change in WLL and WLR scores due to demographic factors, we studied the impact of adding each demographic variable individually and found that age is the dominant factor responsible for the effect attenuation. Similar results were obtained for AFT and LF (see Table). The protective effects of aspirin for heart disease and as a secondary preventive treatment for stroke are well-documented. Many epidemiologic studies have identified stroke and heart disease as independent risk factors for cognitive decline or dementia. It would stand to reason that daily aspirin use could reduce the risk of cognitive decline through reduction of cardiac and cerebrovascular disease, and that this effect should be larger in people having higher risk of stroke. Previous small studies 5 have reported a protective effect, and this was seemingly confirmed in data from the Canadian Health Study 6 and the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging 7 . Other longitudinal cohorts have not replicated these findings. The Women's Health Study found no association between aspirin use and cognitive performance over 9.6 years of follow-up. 8 Analysis of data from 3,229 participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study over age 65 reported no protective effect for aspirin. 9 A 5-year RCT of low-dose aspirin, the Aspirin for Asymptomatic Atherosclerosis trial, reported no association between cognitive decline and aspirin use. 10 We examined cognitive change in REGARDS along two dimensions: memory and executive function. We also were able to capture clinically relevant incident impairment in global cognitive status. Given the large sample, REGARDS is sufficiently powered to detect even small associations, should they exist. However, in this large national sample of black and white adults, we saw no relationship between daily aspirin use and cognitive change over 2 to 6 years of follow-up after controlling for the impact of age.
