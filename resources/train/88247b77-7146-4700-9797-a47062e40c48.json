[{"section_title": "", "text": "deaths have been reported worldwide (2-5) (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus, with an approximately 30,000 base pair genome.\nThe genome is split into ten open reading frames (ORF) that include fifteen non-structural proteins and four structural proteins. The latter category includes the Spike (S), Membrane (M), Envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N). The S protein is the basis for most candidate vaccines, as it mediates 5 virus attachment and entry to host cells and is the target of neutralizing antibody responses (6-8).\nThe S protein is cleaved into two subunits, S1 and S2: the former contains the receptor binding domain (RBD), which enables the virus to attach to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on host cells.\nDeveloping a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is a high priority for preventing and mitigating future 10 waves of the pandemic (9). Vaccine candidates typically include an insert that corresponds to one or more virus antigens, either derived computationally or from one or multiple strain(s) sampled from infected individuals. The first viral sequence derived during the COVID-19 outbreak, Wuhan-Hu-1 (GISAID accession EPI_ISL_402125), was published on January 9, 2020. As many vaccine programs initiated at that time, it is likely that this SARS-CoV-2 sequence, sampled in December 15 2019 in Wuhan, China, will be the foundation for a number of vaccine candidates. Compared to other RNA viruses, coronaviruses have a more complex molecular machinery resulting in higher replication fidelity. The mutation rate of SARS-CoV was estimated at 9.0\u00d710 -7 substitutions per nucleotide per replication cycle (10), a rate that is much lower than that of most RNA viruses (1\u00d710 -3 to 1\u00d710 -5 substitutions per nucleotide per replication cycle) (11) , indicating the limited 20 propensity of coronaviruses to diversify. Nonetheless, as the virus spreads more widely, it is important to monitor the introduction of any mutations that may compromise the potential efficacy of a vaccine candidate based on the first sequence.\nWe can obtain insights about the transmission pathways and temporal spread of a virus by analyzing viral sequences sampled from individuals who became infected. Changes in allele 25 frequencies across sequences indicate the fitness of the virus over time, as it adapts to its host.\nIncreasing fitness will result in pervasive mutations at specific sites that improve virus transmissibility, whereas mutations in a neutral evolution context will be minimal and stochastic.\nIndicators of viral evolution have been shown to be robust predictors of transmission dynamics for several pathogens, such as Influenza (12) , Lassa virus (13) , and Ebola (14) . Typically, the evolution of a virus is driven by genotypic and phenotypic changes in its surface protein. In the 5 case of SARS-CoV-2, mutations in the protein S, which mediates cell entry, are most likely to confer fitness to the virus as it adapts to humans. However, adaptive changes can occur in structural and non-structural proteins, and these changes, as well as different patterns across structural and non-structural proteins, may provide insights into the near-and long-term evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, as it spreads in humans."}, {"section_title": "10", "text": "To characterize SARS-CoV-2 diversification since the beginning of the epidemic, we aligned 5,724 independent SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences (average length of 29,874 nucleotides) isolated from 68 countries ( Figure 1A ) (15) . There were 4,678 polymorphic sites. Only 1,231 (4.19%) showed mutations in two or more sequences ( Figure 1B) . The mean pairwise diversity across genomes was 0.08%, ranging between 0.01% for ORF7b to 0.11% for the nucleocapsid 15 (N). Hamming distances across all genomes showed a narrow distribution with a median of nine nucleotide mutations (Figure S1). A phylogenetic tree reconstructed based on all genome sequences (16) reflected the global spread of the virus: samples from the first six weeks of the outbreak were collected predominantly from China and were more basal in the tree ( Figure 1C ).\nAs the epidemic has progressed, samples have been increasingly obtained across Europe and 20 from the United States (Figure 1A, 1C) . The tree shows multiple introductions of different variants across the globe with introductions from distant locations seeding local epidemics, where infections sometimes went unrecognized for several weeks and allowed wider spread (17) . The tree topology shows minimal structure, even at the genome level, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 viruses have not diverged significantly since the beginning of the pandemic.\nEven with minimal divergence, we verified whether specific sites in the genome were selected to diversify. We used likelihood-based, phylogenetically informed models assuming branch-specific substitution rates (18) and identified eight sites under diversifying selection (i.e. with a nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rates ratio dN/dS > 1), including four sites in S: sites 5, 50, 614 and 943 (Figure 2A) . Three of these four sites rarely varied (with the variant amino acid found 5 in <1% of sequences) and only transiently diversified thus far during the epidemic. In contrast, site 614 changed rapidly: the D614G mutation was introduced into Europe in January and became dominant on that continent ( Figure 2B ) and then globally within two months (found in 55% of sequences) ( Figure S2) . Overall, at least two thirds of sites across the genome were under While there was only limited evidence of diversification at selected sites, we also assessed whether the globally circulating viral population differentiated from the initial population sampled 20 in Wuhan. To do so, we used two measures of population differentiation, the GST and D statistics, which characterize changes in allele frequency across populations and can show fitness differences within subpopulations (21-23). We compared 353 genomes sampled from the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China with 5,280 genomes sampled subsequently across the globe. Genetic distances between two subpopulations can range between 0 and 1, indicating no and complete differentiation, respectively. Although distances varied across genes, the genetic distance between these subpopulations was small, indicating little differentiation between the initial outbreak and its global spread ( Figure 3A ). (Elevated estimates can also be artifacts associated with high mutation rates ( Figure 2E ) (24)).\nSignatures of host adaptation can also be seen in the branching patterns of viral phylogenies.\nBursts in transmissibility are emblematic of increases in relative viral fitness and are reflected in 5 imbalances in the phylogeny, which can be estimated at each internal node ( Figure S3 ) (25-27).\nWe estimated mutational fitness (28, 29) at each internal node of the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny reconstructed from the spike gene and compared the distribution of estimates through time to phylogenies simulated under models of neutral and increasing fitness (i.e., host-adapted). The distribution adhered to expectations of the neutral model and deviated significantly (Mann-10 Whitney test, P<1e-3) from those of increasing fitness ( Figure 3B ). Similar results were obtained when the SARS-CoV-2 and simulated phylogenies were iteratively down-sampled by 50% ( Figure 3C ). Therefore, we concluded that the sample size of sequences was sufficient to test for adaptation. Together, the SARS-CoV-2 population and phylogeny showed no evidence that the global spread of SARS-CoV-2 was related to viral fitness effects. 15 Last, we evaluated two typical vaccine design strategies, which rely either on sampled sequences or on computationally derived sequences that cover the diversity seen across circulating sequences and are in theory optimal compared to an individual isolate (30). We inferred the most recent common ancestors (MRCA) of SARS-CoV-2 S sequences sampled from Wuhan within the first month of the epidemic, from all currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 sequences, and from those 20 corresponding to closely related sequences sampled from pangolins (n=9) and a bat. There were 17 mutations between the human MRCA and the human-bat MRCA and 41 mutations between the human MRCA and human-pangolin MRCA. Overall, three segments in S reflected significant variability across species (AA 439-445, 482-501, 676-690) (Figure 4A-B, Figure S4 ) (31). In contrast, when considering only human sequences, SARS-CoV-2 diversity was limited: both to the initial reference sequence Wuhan-Hu-1 ( Figure 4C ). Comparing these sequences to the consensus sequence derived from all of the sequences sampled to date, there was only one mutation: D614G ( Figure 4C ). Figure 4D illustrates that mutations found across circulating sequences are extremely rare: beside D614G (found in 55% of sequences), the next most frequent mutation is found in 0.87% of sequences, with sequences sampled from infected 5 individuals on average 0.69 mutations away from the consensus sequence (consisting of 0.11 synonymous and 0.57 non-synonymous mutations). Across the genome, there were on average 11.46 nucleotide mutations per individual genome when compared to the consensus, with only two other mutations aside from D614G found in >50% of sequences. Focusing on the RBD, we found no evidence that mutations could affect binding to the ACE2 receptor, as only two shared 10 mutations were identified at contact sites with the ACE2 receptor: a non-synonymous mutation (G476S) found in 8 sequences (0.15% of sequences) and a synonymous mutation found in 2 sequences at position 489 (0.04% of sequences).\nThere remains an urgent need for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine as a primary countermeasure to contain and mitigate the spread of COVID-19. The virus's surface S protein makes an attractive vaccine 15 target because it plays a key role in mediating virus entry and is known to be immunogenic (32) .\nNeutralizing antibody responses against S have been identified in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals (8) and several clinical trials for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine will test S as an immunogen.\nWhile we focused on the S protein, our comparative analyses of other proteins yielded similar conclusions: a randomly selected SARS-CoV-2 sequence could be used as a vaccine candidate 20 given the typical similarity of any sequence to the computationally derived optimum sequence (as defined by the MRCAs or consensus sequence based on all circulating strains). Vaccines developed using any of these sequences should theoretically be effective against all circulating viruses.\nOur analyses showed limited evidence of diversifying selection, with comparable mutation and 25 evolutionary rates in structural proteins versus non-structural proteins (under a selection paradigm, structural proteins which are essential for viral entry and the target of the host immune response would have higher rates than the non-essential proteins), low estimates of genetic differentiation following the initial outbreak, and phylogenetic patterns adhering to a neutral process of evolution. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has not, as yet, adapted to its host as it is spreading globally. Rather, our findings illustrate that epidemiological factors primarily 5 mediated the global evolution of SARS-CoV-2. While certain mutations have increased in frequency, these were likely exported to under-infected areas early in the outbreak and therefore given the opportunity to spread widely (founder effect). For example, in January 2020, a virus carrying the D614G mutation, which had not then been observed among sequences from China, was transmitted to Germany. Host and environmental factors permitted the establishment of a 10 sustained cluster of infections that propagated this mutation until it became dominant among European sequences and then globally ( Figure S2 ). There is no evidence that the frequent identification of this mutation is caused by convergent selection events that would have occurred in multiple individuals. The D614G mutation is at the interface between two subunits and thereby would not be expected to be part of a critical epitope for vaccine mediated protection (Figure 4) . 15 However, an S612L mutation, in the same region as the D614G mutation, has been observed after passaging a MERS-CoV isolate in the presence of two antibodies (in 5/15 clones after 20 passages) (33) . The rare presence of the S612L mutation among MERS-CoV sequences (2 of 473 sequences from humans) indicates that it is unlikely to be a common escape pathway.\nNonetheless, its occurrence in vitro warrants further work to evaluate whether the close-by D614G 20 mutation in SARS-CoV-2 impacts protein stability, conformational changes, infectivity or recognition of a distal epitope. While the possibility of a D614G escape pathway is unknown, mutations in the RBD constitute a likely path to escape antibody recognition, as described for Influenza (34, 35). Importantly, we found no mutation in the RBD that was present in more than 1% of SARS-CoV-2 sequences; such rare variants are unlikely to interfere with vaccine efficacy.\nThese results indicate that so far SARS-CoV-2 has evolved through a non-deterministic, noisy process and that random genetic drift has played the dominant role in disseminating unique mutations throughout the world. Yet, it is important to note that the virus was only recently identified in the human population -a short time frame relative to adaptive processes that can take years to occur. Although we cannot predict whether adaptive selection will be seen in SARS- 5 CoV-2 in the future, the key finding is that SARS-CoV-2 viruses that are currently circulating constitute a homogeneous viral population. Viral diversity has challenged vaccine development efforts for other viruses such as HIV-1, Influenza or Dengue but these viruses each constitute a more diverse population than SARS-CoV-2 viruses ( Figure S5) . We can therefore be cautiously optimistic that viral diversity should not be an obstacle for the development of a broadly protective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.
