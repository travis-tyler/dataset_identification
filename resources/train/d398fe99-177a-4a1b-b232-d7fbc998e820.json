To solve the problem of overfitting because of an insufficient amount of labeled data, data augmentation is performed through rotation, using left and right flips to artificially increase the amount of data.

Although there is an effort to maintain consistency through data harmonization, there is the possibility that the overall quality of the image will deteriorate.\nIt is necessary to study the change of the accuracy by using the data whose resolution is decreased. It is necessary to develop algorithms that can recognize and generalize images of medical images with different resolutions or noise, but it will take a considerable amount of time. Nevertheless, the diagnosis of medical images by the deep-learning architecture developed up till now is almost at expert diagnosis level. In addition, many data that have not yet been analyzed can be discovered and studied with AI diagnosis, and this can accurately and quickly diagnose and improve the quality of medical care dramatically."}]
