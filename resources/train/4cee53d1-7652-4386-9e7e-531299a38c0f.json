[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Structural Equation Modeling or also known as SEM has gained popularity among researchers, academicians and students nowadays. It is due to its flexibility and generality besides can generate an accurate and precise estimation in making prediction. SEM analysis goes through the steps of model specification, data collection, model estimation, model evaluation and also model modification. SEM is a unique method because the researcher can modify the structural model in order to increase the model fitness. Ordinary Least Square or also known as OLS is one of the method used in making prediction and estimation. Same as SEM, it is used to analyze the relationships among (independent, dependent and mediator) variables. Researchers usually use OLS in Regression Analysis and Correlation Analysis in which also can be performed using SEM. However, problems exist during data analysis by using OLS is when multiple response items are used in measuring the variables. What researchers, academician or students normally do in Ordinary Least Square (OLS) method with this problem is by computing the mean response of these items to measure the variables which is theoretically inefficient and will lead to inaccurate findings later on. SEM is better than OLS because it has the ability to calculate the affect of items under each variables individually besides it takes into consideration the structure of mean, variance and covariance simultaneously in its analysis for a more efficient and accurate findings. A secondary data obtained from Trends in Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) will be used to apply SEM method in order to obtain a best fit model for further analysis.

Our target population is eighth grades students in Malaysia. A value of 5733 respondents was randomly chosen from 180 randomly chosen schools in Malaysia. In this case study, eighth grades student\"s attitude towards Mathematics acts as mediating variable and achievement in Mathematics examination acts as dependent variable for this study. Data were obtained from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) international database. Respondents were normally selected through a two stage stratified cluster sampling technique in which consist of cluster sampling for the first stage, school sampling for the second stage and class sampling for the third stage. The questionnaire consists of four independent variables which are; school environment, teacher\"s characteristics, student\"s self-confidence in Mathematics and student\"s motivation in Mathematics. It also includes student\"s attitude in Mathematics which acts as mediating variable and student\"s Mathematics achievement as the dependent variable. The data mining software SPSS PASW version 18.0 and SPSS AMOS were used for the purpose of building model. Several analysis used in this study are Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), Discriminant Validity, Path Analysis, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and Chi Square test. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) is a special form of factor analysis, most commonly used in social research (Ahmad Nazim, 2013). It is different compared to Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) since it is used to test whether measures of a construct consistent with a researcher's understanding of the nature of that construct (or factor). As such, the objective of CFA is to test whether the data fit a hypothesized measurement model. Model fit measures could then be obtained to assess how well the proposed model captured the covariance between all the items or measures in the model (Zainudin, 2012). All redundant items exist in a latent construct will be either removed or constrained (Ahmad Nazim, 2013). Model fitness estimations are as follows: Discriminant validity is the degree to which scores on a test do not correlate with scores from other tests that are not designed to assess the same construct. Correlation coefficients between measures of a construct and measures of conceptually different constructs are usually given as evidence of discriminant validity. If the correlation coefficient is high (>0.85), then the discriminant validity is considered as weak, depending on the theoretical relationship and the magnitude of the coefficient (Zainudin, 2012). On the other hand, if the correlations are low to moderate, this demonstrates that the measure has discriminant validity.  The Structural Equation Modeling or popular known as SEM is a second generation statistical analysis techniques developed for analyzing the inter-relationships among multiple variables in a model. The relationships among variables could be expressed in a series of single and multiple regression equations. SEM technique employs the combination of quantitative and the correlational or causal assumptions into the model (Zainudin, 2012). SEM can indirectly estimates the items under latent construct individually. Latent construct is the variable which can\"t be measure directly since it is only a hypothetical concept of a research. Latent construct is also known as unobserved variables, it is measured using a set of items in a questionnaire. The use of SEM is also able to model the relationship among these constructs and analyze them simultaneously.  Table 2 shows the Factor Loading, Cronbach Alpha, Critical Ratio (CR) and Average Variance Extracted (AVE) values of each latent constructs. According to Zainudin (2012), the factor loading for a newly developed scale must be higher or equal to 0.5. In this study, items with factor loading value of lower than 0.5 were dropped one at a time (starts with the lowest value) from its\" constructs until the unidimensionality, parsimonious, incremental and absolute fits are achieved. In this study, pooled CFA was applied since a few constructs have less than four items in its construct which lead to identification problem. After all items of less than 0.5 were decided to be removed or kept in its construct, the Modification Indices (MI) of items under each latent constructs were checked. If the MI indices of a pair of items are greater than 15, the items need to be set as \"free parameter estimate\" or constrained to avoid insignificant of model fitness later on. In this study, items (ach01 and ach04, mot1 and mot5, mot1 and mot6, mot3 and mot5) have MI value of greater than 15 and were constrained Besides that, items att2, sc3 and mot2 were removed because have an extreme correlation with items att3, sc5 and mot1 with MI values of 753.8, 566.156 and 252.866 respectively."}, {"section_title": "Correlation coefficient =", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "RESULTS AND ANALYSIS 3.1. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)", "text": "As for measurement values, all constructs have achieved the minimum estimation required which are 0.70 for Cronbach Alpha, 0.60 for CR and 0.50 for AVE. Therefore, it can be concluded that Convergent Validity (AVE \u2265 0.5), Internal Reliability (Cronbach Alpha \u2265 0.6) and Construct Reliability (CR \u2265 0.60) of all constructs had been achieved.  Table 3 shows the fitness indices of all latent constructs in the model. All constructs have a ChiSq/df value of less than 5.0, therefore the Parsimonious fit had been achieved. Constructs also have TLI, CFI, AGFI and GFI values of higher than 0.9 and RMSEA value of less than 0.05. Therefore, Incremental and Absolute fitness also had been achieved. It can be concluded that all fitness indexes required in a model had been achieved. Figure 2 shows the strength of correlation between all constructs in the model. All constructs have correlations of less than 0.85. It can be concluded that discriminant validity had been achieved and no construct need to be dropped from the model.

At the end of the processes, convergent validity, internal reliability and constructs reliability of all constructs had been achieved. In addition, discriminant validity of the model was achieved since the correlations between constructs in the model are below 0.85. In path analysis, the type of mediations exist between constructs were determined and re-specified in order to obtain the actual influential structural model. At the end of the modelling process, the Chi-Square/df value was obtained and it shows a value of 3.674 which conclude that the model is now in its best structure for further analysis for a more efficient and accurate inter-relationship among variables findings and interpretation.
