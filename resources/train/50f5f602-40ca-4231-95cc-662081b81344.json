However, ensuing lockdowns and travel restrictions to minimize the healthcare burden has led to wellbeing decline and economic downturn, with profound impacts in low-tomiddle income countries (10). The contention phase in Colombia started with the first case of COVID-19 confirmed by the Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS) on March 6, 2020, from a person returning from Italy on February 26, 2020 (11).On March 23, 2020, 314 cases had been confirmed which prompted the closure of all the country borders to contain the outbreak. On\nMarch 31, 2020, more than 10% of confirmed cases were missing from the contact-tracing (infections linked to unknown sources), and therefore the mitigation phase was declared with physical-distancing as the main strategy to further limit virus spread. On June 18, 2020, 57,046 confirmed cases, and 1,864 deaths had been reported in Colombia (12).\nThe unprecedented global health and societal emergency posed by the COVID-19 pandemic urged unprecedented data sharing and faster-than-ever outbreak research developments which are reflected in the fact that over 37.000 SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes have been made available through public databases, mainly GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data). Genome availability and the fact that SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus with an estimated substitution rate of around 0.8\u00d710 substitutions/site/year (13, 14) , enabled us to detect the virus is fast generating genetic variation as it is transmitted, and therefore genomic epidemiology is a powerful approach to characterize the outbreak (15) . This approach which relies on phylogenetic analysis has allowed researchers across the world to ascertain SARS-CoV-2 emergence in humans, to track its geographical spread and to investigate its evolutionary dynamics (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) .\n.

Our study suggests multiple independent introductions from across the world, mainly from Europe and the co-circulation of multiple lineages in the most affected departments. These findings contribute to the molecular surveillance of COVID-19 and provide venues for future outbreak response and interventions in the country.\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted June 29, 2020. \nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted June 29, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.26.20135715 doi: medRxiv preprint 9 cases were Spain (30.5%), the United States of America (25.2%), Mexico (6%), Ecuador (5.8%), and Brazil (5.1%). The number of symptomatic imported cases steadily increased and reached a peak on March 14, 2020, when local cases were on the rise and earlier than the closure of borders and ban of international air travel. Our estimate is based on the average incubation time of COVID-19 (42) and consequently 4.8 days earlier than peak based on symptoms onset (March 18, Figure 1B ). The first introductions were predominantly linked to Europe, however, both Europe and the American region were important geographical sources of infections during the onset of the epidemic. The introductions post-peak occurred for the most part from South American countries.\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted June 29, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.26.20135715 doi: medRxiv preprint 1 1 ancestor for the sampled sequence data is December 7, 2019 (October 25 -December 26). Asia was the inferred ancestral state at the root. Both these observations are in line with the known epidemiology of the pandemic. A root-to-tip regression of genetic distance against sampling time evidenced consistent temporal signal in the sequence data ( Figure 2B ). The isolates from Colombia appeared intersperse among the isolates from other countries (Figure 2A and 2C) suggesting multiple introductions. However, there was considerable phylogenetic uncertainty along the tree and the fine-grained relationships of the isolates from Colombia could not be resolved with confidence ( Figure S1 ). Phylogenetic uncertainty together with uneven sampling Figure 3B and Figure S2 ). This observation is also in agreement with our estimates using travel data as detailed below ( Figure 3C and Figure S2 ).\nBetween January and March 2020, 7 cities of Colombia received 1,593,211 international passengers from 14 countries. Bogot\u00e1 concentrated the majority of the flights with around 77% of the passengers, followed by Medell\u00edn with 11%, Cartagena with 6%, and Cali with 4%. In total, 35% of international passengers started their journey in the USA, 17% in Mexico, and 12%\nin Chile. However, we estimate that 87% of all imported COVID-19 cases came from Europe, 9.5% from North America, and 3.4% from South America. When stratified by country, the .

We estimate that the route Spain-Bogot\u00e1 carried 42% of the total imported cases.\nSince the first introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Colombia (February 26, 2020) contacttracing efforts had been set in place. Multiple sequences were obtained from seven distinct early epidemiologically-linked transmission chains. This information was mapped into the phylogeny ( Figure 2C ) and all but one set of sequences did not group. However, it appeared very close in the tree. This underscores the potential utility of genomic epidemiology to link individuals with incomplete information (e.g. cases that end-up disconnected due to intermediate asymptomatic\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted June 29, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.26.20135715 doi: medRxiv preprint 1 3 data and our estimates from travel data. However, more sequence data from Colombia and undersampled countries together with information of sampling representativeness per country is needed in order to account for sampling uncertainty in a more statistically rigorous manner.\nOur study provided evidence that an important number of independent introductions occurred to Colombia with at least 12 lineages documented. Most of the notified introductions occurred from Europe and this observation was supported by phylogenetic and air travel data.\nAlthough the sequence data do not represent the actual number of epidemiologically-linked transmission chains, our phylogenetic findings validated the linkage for those epidemiologicallylinked transmission chains with available sequence data. Our results further underscore the advantages of genome sequencing to complement COVID-19 outbreak investigation and support the need for a more comprehensive country-wide study of the epidemiology and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Colombia.

Thirdly, the number of sequences sampled represented a tiny fraction of the documented number of imported cases into Colombia; the sample was selected to be a country-wide representative given limited resources for genome sequencing and consequently, the introduced viral diversity may also have been underestimated.\nAnother limitation of this analysis is the inherent uncertainty stemming from global unsystematic sampling.
