AD pathology begins to accumulate at least 10 to 20 years before clinical symptoms appear [1, 3, 4] , and there is a growing consensus that effective treatment of AD will require early intervention [5, 6] . The amyloid cascade is the primary target of the largest ongoing clinical trials [7] , including DIAN-TU (DIAN Trial Unit) [8] , A4 trial (Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease) [9] , and API (Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative) [10] in preclinical population. Well validated biomarkers of amyloid accumulation are needed for these treatment development efforts and trial design [5, 6] .\nThe most commonly used quantification technique for amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging involves comparing regional uptake to cerebellar cortex [11, 12] . However, the observation of amyloid deposition in the cerebellar cortex of familial AD cases [13, 14] had led to the identification and validation of pons as an alternative reference region [15] . A large white matter region of interest (ROI) has been proposed as an reference region to provide improved discrimination between clinically defined groups [16] ; and a smaller \"core\" white matter reference region was reported to improve the detection of changes in tracer retention in longitudinal studies within the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) [ 18 F]florbetapir data [17] .\nCorrection of partial volume effects represents another area of active investigation [18] . PET imaging based measurement is subjected to partial volume effects, because of the low spatial resolution [19] . Although partial volume effects are well-recognized, correction techniques remain controversial. One study comparing two-component (brain and non-brain) vs. threecomponent (gray matter, white matter, non-brain) reported relative advantages and disadvantages of both methods [20] . Thomas et al. [21] reported improved quantitative accuracy using a region-based voxel-wise partial volume correction (PVC) method. More recently, Brendel et al. [16] and our group [18] found PVC improved the power to detect longitudinal amyloid burden change.\nA third methodological choice concerns the quantitative model used to determine amyloid burden. The most commonly used approach is the target-to-reference region standard-uptake-value-ratio (SUVR) [4, 16, 17] . SUVR evaluation is simple and only requires a short acquisition, which translates to low cost. However, SUVR measurements are sensitive to the choice of temporal window used for evaluation, in part, owing to individual variability in cerebral perfusion [16, 22] . Alternatively, kinetic modeling techniques [23, 24] can be used to calculate distribution volume ratio (DVR) or binding potential (BP ND ) as a quantitative measure of amyloid burden [11, 22] . These techniques require longer dynamic PET acquisitions initiated in synchrony with tracer administration and are less attractive because of increased participant burden, study cost and complexity of quantification.\nIt should be pointed out that currently a \"gold standard\" technique that objectively measures brain amyloid burden is not available for validation of in vivo amyloid PET measurements. Some other criteria are often used to judge the performance of amyloid quantification techniques. These criteria include low inter-subject variability in reference regions [15, 22] , strong group differences between control subjects and AD patients [15, 16, 22] , and, in longitudinal studies, strong longitudinal changes [16, 17, 25] . Here, we investigate the impact of 1) reference region selection; 2) correction for partial volume effects; and 3) choice of quantification technique using cross-sectional and longitudinal [ 11 C]-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) imaging data from the DIAN study. Regional SUV and volume of distribution (V T ) were used to determine the stability of reference regions tracer uptake by comparing mutation carriers against non-carriers. The power of detecting longitudinal changes was also examined to compare different amyloid quantification techniques."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "The participants included in this study were recruited as part of the international Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) [26] . The DIAN includes individuals from families with known autosomal dominant mutation in amyloid precursor protein [27] , presenilin 1 [28] , or presenilin 2 [29] genes leading to early onset AD. The current study was based on the eighth semiannual data cutoff with a total of 341 participants who had at least one PiB scan; among them 203 were mutation carriers (APP = 27, PSEN1 = 161, PSEN2 = 15); within these 203 participants, 59 had usable PiB scans for at least two visits on the same scanners and formed the longitudinal mutation carrier cohort (LC). For participants with more than two PiB scans, the first two usable visits with an interval as close to 2 years as possible (range 0.8-3.3 yrs) was included in this study. The same scanner rule was enforced to minimize the impact of scanner difference. Within the LC cohort, a subset of 23 participants (LC_Dyn) had full dynamic scans at both time points. A longitudinal cohort for non-carriers (LNC) was also selected using the same criteria and had a total of 36 participants.

Follow-up MCSUVRs were compared with their corresponding baseline measurements using paired t-test. Cohen's d effect size measure was calculated based on the mean and standard deviation of the annual rate of change in MCSUVR. Percent change in MCSUVR was also compared between quantification methods using paired t-test. In addition, we also estimated the number of participants per arm needed to detect a 25% and 50% reduction in amyloid accumulation rate due to treatment with 80% power and a two-tailed type-I error of p = 0.05 in a 12-month placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial. The 25% reduction was selected to match a similar study [17] . The 50% reduction was included to approximate hypothesized treatment effects in anti-amyloid treatment trials. The sample size calculation was performed using MATLAB (R2015b) (The Mathworks Inc, Natick, MA) function: sampsizepwr, in the statistics and machine learning toolbox v10.1. The calculation was performed based on the observed annual rate of change in MCSUVR and its standard deviation. LNC cohort data were also analyzed as a test-retest study, since amyloid burden and its change are not expected in this cohort of young participants. A test-retest variability measure was defined as:TRT% = (|M 1 -M 2 |/M 1 )\u00d7100%, where M 1 was the amyloid burden measurement at baseline and M 2 was the follow-up measurement. The mean and standard deviation of TRT % was evaluated for the LNC cohort and compared among different quantification methods.\nFor the LC cohort, using either cerebellar cortex or brain stem as the reference region, longitudinal MCSUVR change was not significant without partial volume, while PVC revealed the change (Table 4 ). Using core white matter and total white matter reference regions revealed significant longitudinal change in MCSUVR with or without PVC ( Table 4 ). The MCSUVR change from baseline to follow-up had the smallest p values with (p = 0.0000075) and without (p = 0.000017) PVC when core white matter was used as the reference. PVC and using white matter as reference region also led to larger effect size (Table 4 ). PVC based analysis generated significantly (p<0.0005) larger longitudinal percent change in MCSUVR regardless of the reference regions used ( Table 4 ). PVC and adoption of white matter as reference led to a considerably smaller estimated sample size needed to achieve an 80% power and two-sided type-I error of p = 0.05 to detect a reduced rate of amyloid accumulation in hypothetical anti-amyloid therapy trials. For the LNC cohort, no change in MCSUVR was observed, as expected, between baseline and follow-up regardless of the quantification methods used.

White matter PiB uptake was not more stable in either the non-carrier control population or the mutation carrier participants. In fact, the coefficient of variation was greater for white matter than for cerebellar cortex and brain stem. In the LNC cohort, larger test-retest variability was observed when core white matter was used as reference region in comparison to cerebellar cortex referencing. On the other hand, a (non-significant) trend was observed towards lower white matter uptake (for both core and total white matter regions) for mutation carriers than noncarriers in the IDAIF analysis and partial volume corrected SUV, suggesting potential changes in white matter region properties in the mutation carriers that may alter white matter tracer uptake. We suspect such changes in the white matter region over time may, in part, be the cause of the improved power in detecting longitudinal MCSUVR change using white matter referencing. In addition, the observed longitudinal change in MCSUVR agreed well (Pearson r = 0.66, p = 1.03E-8) when cerebellar cortex and brain stem were used as the reference region. However, the longitudinal MCSUVR changes measured using white matter as reference region did not agree (Pearson r = 0.25, p = 0.052) with the results obtained using cerebellar cortex referencing. These differences suggest that using white matter as the reference region potentially leads to less consistent results."}, {"section_title": "Partial Volume Correction", "text": "We show that PVC enhances sensitivity for the detection of longitudinal changes in PiB binding in the DIAN cohort, in accordance with our previous report in a sporadic AD cohort [18] .

Two separate characteristics of PVC technique may be the causes of the beneficial effects. Firstly, PVC amplifies the signal we want to detect more than the amplification of noise therefore improve signal to noise ratio. Secondly, without PVC, MCSUVR and its change over time is dependent upon both amyloid deposition and brain atrophy; when PVC is performed we can separate the two processes. Therefore, we strongly recommend PVC especially in longitudinal studies aimed at detecting changes in amyloid burden."}, {"section_title": "Full Dynamic Acquisition and Modeling", "text": "Moderate improvement was observed when full dynamic PET acquisition was available. As previously reported [36] , SUVR analysis is more sensitive to the choice of time window used for quantification. Improved statistical power with full dynamic scanning likely is attributable to greater consistency in the selection of the time window used for quantification. In short acquisitions, uptake time may vary from one scan to the next. Regional binding potential estimation provided improved statistical power in comparison to SUVR, as previously reported [36] . Nevertheless, full kinetic modeling requires longer scan time and the quantification requires more PET imaging expertise, both of which could lead to increased cost. However, such increases in cost may be offset by improved accuracy, increased statistical power and reduced sample size. This trade-off should be carefully evaluated at study design."}, {"section_title": "Observed Longitudinal Change", "text": "In this study, moderate annual rate of change in amyloid burden was observed with substantial inter-individual variability. And it appears that the inter-individual variability was larger when cerebellar cortex was used as reference than when white matter were used as reference. Partial volume correction increased the magnitude of the annual rate of change no matter what reference region was used. Similar annual rate of change was observed in this cohort (0.02\u00b10.05 in MCBP) in comparison to our previous observations in a sporadic AD cohort (0.016\u00b10.03 in MCBP) [18] . Using ADNI [ 18 F]-florbetapir data, Chen et al. [17] reported an annual rate of SUVR change of 0.013\u00b10.011 in the asymptomatic amyloid positive group, and an annual rate of 0.012\u00b10.014 in the MCI amyloid positive group using cerebral white matter as the reference. A similar rate of change was also reported by Brendel et al. [16] using white matter as reference region based on the same dataset. In comparison, in this current study in the DIAN cohort using PiB as the tracer, we observed a substantially larger annual rate of 0.02\u00b10.03 in SUVR in a cohort that is a mixture of MCI (CDR = 0.5) and asymptomatic participants using similar reference region. The estimated sample size needed for anti-amyloid trials were similar between the two studies. The difference in annual rate of change and similarity of estimated sample size is likely a combined effects of cohorts, tracer, and quantification methods, and further investigation is necessary."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "The analysis performed in this study is based on the DIAN cohort using PiB as the imaging tracer. Whether our observations can be translated to other cohorts and/or using other amyloid tracers remains to be determined. We focused our comparison of quantification methodology on those utilizing structural MR obtained on the same participant. While MR data is generally available for most of the ongoing neuroimaging studies, quantification methods that does not require MR [37] [38] [39] have their advantages and warrant further investigation. In this study, we focused on a single PVC technique in based on our previous experience [18] . This technique depends on segmentation of high resolution structural MR data. Other techniques that do not rely on structural MR data are available, such as deconvolution based approaches [40] and resolution recovery techniques incorporated into image reconstruction [41] , although they generally cannot achieve full recovery of the resolution. Nevertheless, these techniques is worth investigating further as well because they can be applied in cases where only PET data are available. One approach we took to assess the stability and noise properties of reference region tracer uptake was based on an IDAIF technique using population based parent compound ratio for metabolites correction [30] . It should be pointed out that there is potentially group difference in tracer metabolism as well as inter individual variability which may introduce noise into the estimated tracer uptake. This can be investigated by performing actual metabolites measurement in a similar cohort. Nevertheless, the observation we obtained using this approach is consistent with SUV analysis. Additional investigation is also warranted on the feasibility of using an IDAIF approach for absolute quantification of amyloid burden in general."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "We examined several technical variations in the approach to obtain quantitative and semiquantitative measurement of amyloid burden using PET imaging. PVC emerged as the strategy that most consistently improved statistical power for the detection of both longitudinal changes and across-group differences. This result accords with several previously reported studies [16, 18, 21] . Among several reference regions, core white matter provided the greatest sensitivity for the detection of longitudinal changes. However, the observed longitudinal change using white matter reference may be confounded by processes unrelated to amyloid burden and requires further investigation. We observed some advantages of acquiring full dynamic PET rather than shorter scans. However, given the countervailing costs, it remains unclear whether the advantages of full dynamic scanning outweigh the disadvantages. For the ADAD population with PiB imaging, utilizing brainstem as a reference region with PVC may be optimal for current interventional trials. Further investigation of technical issues in quantitative amyloid imaging in different study populations using different amyloid imaging tracers is warranted.\nNCF SF MWW.
