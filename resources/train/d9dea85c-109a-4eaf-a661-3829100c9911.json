[{"section_title": "I. Introduction", "text": "Scientific discovery and technological innovation are critical to a nation's economy, living standards, and security. 1 Discovery and innovation are driven in large part by the quantity and quality of the nation's science and engineering (STEM) workforce. In an increasingly globalized labor market for these skilled workers, the ability to attract and retain foreign-born scientists and engineers has become a recognized source of competitive advantage (OECD 2002, National Research Council 2005. The United States, in particular, has been successful in this pursuit through a combination of world-class universities and globally competitive salaries (Galama and Hosek 2008). From the myriad of possible gateways through which a skilled migrant can enter the U.S. job market, this paper focuses on foreign students who earn a doctoral degree in the United States and get an opportunity to stay. American policy makers need to understand how potential future changes in salary differentials between the United States and emerging markets will change foreign workers' migration decisions and in turn impact American competitiveness in STEM-related fields. Since the 1940's, the U.S. has benefited from the brain-drain phenomenon whereby foreigners tended to remain in the country after completing their educations (Grubel andScott 1966, Huang 1988). Foreign-born graduates now comprise the majority of PhDs awarded at U.S. universities in physical sciences and engineering, and make up a growing percentage of the overall STEM workforce. 2 Policy makers should not take the brain drain for granted because recent data suggests that foreign STEM graduates are returning to their home countries in greater numbers. For example, the Chinese Statistical Yearbook (2008) reports that the percentage of Chinese students returning as hai gui after obtaining a graduate degree in the United States has almost doubled in the last twenty years. Anecdotal reports and surveys of current students' return intentions also hint at an ongoing increase in return rates (Wadhwa et al. 2009, Winnett 2009, LaFraniere 2010. U.S. policy makers are alarmed about the potential loss of foreign science and engineering talent (National Research Council 2005, Zweig et al. 2004, Wadhwa et al. 2009 because of the dependence of U.S. corporations and research centers on this source of labor (Paral and Johnson 2004). 3 To attract foreign STEM talent, policy makers and managers need to understand employment and location preferences of foreign STEM students. This paper proposes a novel approach for understanding the foreign STEM workers' decisions to stay in the United States or return home. We employ conjoint analysis (Green et al. 2001) to measure the location preferences of Chinese doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers in science and engineering at three different American research universities (hereafter called Chinese STEM PhDs). Chinese students are an important group to study because they are the largest nationality among foreign-born STEM PhD candidates in the United States. 4 Furthermore, China's robust economic growth, combined with the government's active recruitment of U.S.educated students (Luo et al. 2003), has in recent years created many previously unavailable opportunities for returnees. Since the mid-1990s, the return rates among Chinese STEM PhDs have been the lowest among all nationalities, at around 10% of graduates (Finn 2010, Chinese Statistical Yearbook 2008. Our analysis indicates this apparent hesitation to return is primarily driven by the superior salaries offered by American employers relative to their Chinese counterparts, not by any inherent preference for staying in the United States. The results of our analysis allow us to answer a number of important prospective counterfactual questions in light of the recent trend toward increased return migration: How many more graduates would return to China if the wage disparity between the two labor markets were to decrease? What demographic and attitudinal characteristics are correlated with a stronger preference for staying in the United States? How many more graduates would return home if Chinese job opportunities offered greater managerial responsibilities (a factor suggested by Iredale et al. 2003)? Another important policy question concerns the impact of a potential shift in job opportunities inside the United States: whereas Chinese immigrant communities and their associated social networks are mainly located in large U.S. coastal cities (Faist 1999, Keren et al. 2003, many new job opportunities for STEM PhDs are located outside the West Coast and the Northeast corridor-in areas such as North Carolina's Research Triangle Park or Austin's concentration of tech companies based around the University of Texas. A question thus arises concerning whether a student without a job offer in a U.S. coastal city would rather return to China. Conjoint analysis is a state-of-the-art revealed-preference survey technique widely used by both academics and market researchers to estimate individual-level preferences for products and services (Orme 2006). Our conjoint analysis answers the above counterfactual questions by asking Chinese STEM PhDs to choose from and further evaluate several hypothetical job offers that differ in a number of attributes including location, salary, and status. The survey produces a unique dataset in which each person makes 50 hypothetical employment decisions. The multiple responses per individual allow us to estimate each individual's utility of a potential job as a function of the job attributes. Given individual-level estimates, we then simulate and aggregate individual choices from a set of job offers using a random utility framework. Surveys have an obvious external validity disadvantage over actual return-migration data. On the flipside, an advantage of survey data in the return-migration context is its ability to measure preferences beyond the empirical range of available secondary data. For example, we can measure response to job offers with combinations of location and salary not currently available in the market but potentially available in the future. Conjoint analysis is a particularly useful survey method because it presents respondents with difficult tradeoffs between multiple desirable job attributes, only one of which is location. By expressing preferences for some job offers over others, the respondents are more likely to reveal their true multi-attribute preferences (Green et al. 2001, Orme 2006. Prior direct surveys of return intentions among foreign doctoral students tend to overpredict the extent of return migration among Chinese STEM PhDs. 5 In contrast, our simulations match reality closely, indicating an average return rate of 8%-10% based on current salary differentials. We thus propose that conjoint analysis is a useful and valid tool for answering the counterfactual questions we pose above. Academics from other disciplines have reached a similar conclusion about the ability of conjoint analysis to de-bias surveys (Shamir and Shamir 1995, Sassi et al. 2005, Caruso et al. 2009. We surveyed 289 Chinese STEM PhDs at three large research universities located in Illinois, California, and North Carolina. We asked each candidate to first choose between 25 pairs of different jobs. We then asked them to evaluate 25 additional jobs in isolation. Bayesian analysis with a hierarchical prior allowed us to pool the pairwise preferences and single-job evaluations into a single preference estimate while simultaneously capturing similarities in preferences across respondents with similar demographics. Our results indicate the average Chinese STEM PhD cares a lot about location and salary, prefers to live in a Chinese coastal city, and prefers receiving a higher salary. Other factors, such as managerial job status and the private versus public nature of the employer, are less important. Interestingly, the average Chinese STEM PhD prefers to locate in a coastal Chinese city such as Shanghai not only over any U.S. region, but also over his or her hometown. This finding suggests career concerns, rather than proximity to family, drive location preference within China. Chinese coastal cities might also be desirable for reasons other than the availability of jobs, such as cultural attractions, modern amenities, and higher concentration of common social networks (e.g., fellow hai gui). We find a lot of heterogeneity in preferences, so the average preference discussed above is not necessarily relevant for predicting behavior of the group. The most striking variation in preferences related to a particular demographic is the difference between men and women. Overall, women are less willing to sacrifice income to return to China. Using conjoint analysis, we can pinpoint different drivers of this effect depending on marital status: single women are less salary sensitive and prefer jobs located in the United States regardless of exact location. The greater preference among single women for remaining in the United States replicates findings in other studies (Zweig and Chen 1995). Married women have different detailed location preferences from single women: they do not like Chinese coastal cities, and they are much more willing to smaller American cities. We also find that students expressing a higher degree of general national pride (as measured by the scale of Smith and Kim 2006) were more willing to sacrifice income to return home. These results are also qualitatively consistent with earlier findings of the migration literature Hazen 2005, Kellogg 2010). Although the correlations between demographics and preferences are important for understanding potential heterogeneity in return migration, the research questions we ask are best answered with separate simulations of every individual's decision. We present five simulation studies that address the concrete policy questions presented above. Our simulations suggest the return rate of Chinese STEM PhDs is quite elastic in the salary gap between the two countries. In other words, small changes in the prevailing salaries of the U.S. and Chinese STEM labor markets are predicted to cause relatively large changes in return migration. For example, if and when the gap shrinks to half of its current level (currently ~$50,000/year), we predict returns to China among STEM PhDs will increase threefold to about 27% of graduates. Our results indicate several possible actions U.S. policy makers can take in response to such an exodus of talent. First and most obviously, widening the wage gap again by boosting the starting U.S. salaries of newly minted PhD engineers and scientists is possible, perhaps through a targeted tax break. Second, the government may try to attract demographic groups more likely to stay, for example, females or postdocs. 6 Our simulations not only suggest which demographic groups are more likely to stay, but also estimate the effects of different policies. In answering our other questions, we find improved managerial status is not a strong driver of return migration, and a shift of the STEM job opportunities from the West Coast and Northeast to the other regions of the United States does not present a great threat to retaining Chinese talent given the current wage differential between the two nations. We organize the article as follows: Section II presents a brief discussion of relevant return migration literature, especially as it relates to Chinese students in the United States. Section III describes the conjoint survey design and provides the methodological approach to our analysis. Section IV discusses the random-utility model of preferences and its estimation. Section V then presents four simulation studies that address our concrete policy questions, and section VI concludes with a discussion of the policy implications."}, {"section_title": "II. Related Literature", "text": "The literature on migration patterns of highly skilled workers from less-developed countries has concentrated on three broad channels: incentives, remittances, and returns. Unlike the first two areas, return migration has received relatively little attention until the last decade. This emerging interest in return migration has coincided with the rapid economic growth of traditional donor nations, such as China and India, and widely reported increases in returnees to these countries. Much of the research focuses on the consequences of return migration (Johnson and Regets 1998, National Research Council 2005, Galama and Hosek 2008 but not on an understanding of the causes, that is, the underlying individual decision making. Most of what we know about causes is gleaned from intention and attitude surveys that tend to overestimate the extent of return migration (Huang 1988, Orleans 1988, Zweig and Chen 1995, Kellogg 2010. This article addresses the positive bias in simple surveys, essentially an issue of hidden migratory preferences, by proposing conjoint analysis as a better survey technique. Conjoint analysis can reveal underlying preferences from choices among hypothetical products or services as long as the respondents make these choices as if they were real. Theoretically, explanations for return migration do not fit into traditional microeconomic theories of labor migration based exclusively on income maximization (Sjaastad 1962, Harris andTodaro 1970), because salary differentials are consistently in favor of host countries. Instead, researchers agree that return migration decisions involve many additional factors (Glaser 1978, Iredale et al. 2003, Balaz and Williams 2004, Hazen and Alberts 2006. A number of alternative theories that focus on non-monetary aspects to explain return migration have emerged in recent years. Research shows that individual factors shaping return decisions vary based on a migrant's country of origin (Dustmann andWeiss 2007, Gibson andMcKenzie 2009). Since our study focuses on Chinese nationals, we next consider the specific factors shaping their decisions. Before Tiananmen, many Chinese students remained in the United States due to political instability in the PRC (Orleans 1988, Zhang 1992. After green cards became available to all Chinese students attending U.S. universities during Tiananmen (so-called \"June 4th Green Card\"), emigration became an individual decision (Xiang 2003). Studies of Chinese students in the United States in the post-Tiananmen period have found three categories of factors driving return migration: career prospects, sociopolitical preferences, and family ties. These categories appear in the literature under different labels, and Alberts and Hazen (2005, p. 131) have summarized their impact on return migration well: \"Professional factors were generally cited as encouraging the students to stay in the United States, while societal and personal factors were more likely to draw them back to their home countries.\" Professional development opportunities, prospective business ventures, and salary have been the most widely cited career-related drivers of return migration to China. Iredale et al. (2003) report that Chinese returnees were focused on finding positions in which they could have a significant managerial role, a prospect many felt was restricted in the United States. Given robust Chinese economic growth, entrepreneurial opportunities are particularly attractive to those returnees with the necessary social connections (Saxien 2001), experience with venture capital markets (Wang and Zweig 2009), and/or access to marketable technology (Zweig et al. 2006). Although the importance of monetary compensation was once a taboo subject among Chinese students (Zweig and Chen 1995), recent surveys have shown that higher salaries are indeed important in shaping migratory decisions (Keren et al. 2003, Kellogg 2010. Sociopolitical factors cover areas of gender, ethnonational networks, and expressions of nationalism. Zweig and Chen (1995) find gender is the best predictor of who will return, as women express a much higher intention to remain in the United States. Prior studies are unclear as to whether the underlying reason for women preferring to remain in the United States is related to better marriage prospects, fewer gender barriers in the workplace, or fewer responsibilities to elderly parents in a Confucian society. Although the intention to stay in the United States has not varied geographically in surveys covering multiple U.S. universities Chen 1995, Kellogg 2010), immigrant groups are generally less willing to live in areas far from ethnic community centers. On issues of nationalism, Hazen and Alberts (2006) report that Chinese students-more than any other nationality attending the University of Minnesota-cited \"giving back to their homeland\" as a reason for returning. Likewise, recent surveys have shown Chinese students expressing views in support of Chinese government positions on a variety of controversial decisions are more likely to intend to return home (Kellogg 2010). Family ties have a strong influence on the decision-making process as well. Guo and Iredale (2003) report the tendency of couples to choose to remain in the United States because of concerns about the transition of their children to the highly competitive Chinese school system. This concern appears to be so prevalent that among returnees, one spouse commonly returns alone while the rest of the family remains abroad (Keren et al. 2003). Studies also show parental opinion about staying in the host country is a factor Chen 1995, Salaff andGreve 2009), with the pull of filial obligation to comply with parents' wishes particularly strong among first-born sons."}, {"section_title": "III. Conjoint Analysis: Survey Design and Data Description", "text": "Given the heterogeneity of the return migration decision process (both idiosyncratic and due to socio-demographic factors described in section II), the use of an in-depth individual-level survey, such as conjoint analysis, helps make a study realistic. Conjoint analysis was first developed in the 1960s as a marketing tool for measuring and predicting consumer preferences for products characterized by several distinct attributes (Green and Srinivasan 1978, Green et al. 2001, Orme 2006). In recent years, academics from an increasingly wide number of disciplines have used the approach (Shamir and Shamir 1995, Sassi et al. 2005, Caruso et al. 2009. Although the use of conjoint analysis for migration studies has been limited (Lieber 1979), numerous works looking at the preferences of job candidates have successfully employed this technique in recent years (Biesma et al. 2006, Norwood and Henneberry 2006, Montgomery and Ramus 2007. A survey approach has three major advantages over secondary data. First, the survey can collect multiple observations of each respondent, allowing individual-level estimation of indirect utility. Second, the survey can present the respondent with options not currently available in the real world, allowing counterfactuals to be based on data rather than extrapolation. Finally, the survey designer exogenously manipulates the explanatory variables, avoiding various endogeneity and selection problems that usually plague the analysis of secondary data. The challenge in using conjoint analysis to study return migration is finding a critical decision to focus on in the process. For our population, we chose to focus on the job-selection process. In the final year of their graduate programs, STEM PhDs face a lengthy job search that often covers both academic and industry opportunities. Embodied in this search are considerations regarding salary, scope of work responsibilities, career growth potential, and location. Wrapped inside the location attribute are many socio-cultural considerations such as spousal wishes, children's schooling, parental expectations, ties to social and professional networks, and cultural comfort. Our survey isolates the impact of several important factors (also called \"job attributes\" in conjoint nomenclature) by asking respondents to evaluate a battery of hypothetical job offers designed to facilitate subsequent estimation of the marginal effect of each attribute on the revealed preferences. Our survey has three main parts: (1) pairwise comparison of job offers, (2) rating of individual job offers, and (3) attitudinal and demographic questions. The first two sections of the questionnaire each consist of 25 questions. Every question presents the respondent with either two different job offers (pairwise comparison) or a single offer (individual job offer). Examples of questions from both of these sections can be found be in the Appendix. We included both response modalities to balance their strengths and weaknesses. In the pairwise comparison, respondents must consider two job offers and indicate the degree of their preference on a 10-point scale (0=complete preference for the offer on the left, 10=total preference for the offer on the right). The strength of the pairwise modality is its resemblance to a simple choice, which makes the survey task easy for the subject and directly interpretable for the analyst interested in predicting choice behavior. The weakness of any pairwise judgment is a tendency of easily evaluated attributes (e.g., salary) to unduly dominate the implied revealed preferences (Hsee and Zhang 2004). The second modality we use addresses this weakness. In the single-offer exercise, respondents rate each job offer on a scale from 0 to 100 according to their subjective probability of accepting the offer (0=\"Definitely would not take this job offer,\" 100=\"Definitely would take this job offer\"). We place the single-offer evaluations after the pairwise judgments in the survey to provide the respondent with direct experience of the study's attribute range, and hence help the respondent calibrate his or her preference scale. The strength of this holistic evaluation is that it allows harder-to-evaluate attributes such as location or status to influence the revealed preferences. The weakness is the artificiality of the task: although the respondents make choices all of the time in their daily lives, they are unlikely to evaluate those choices on 100-point scales. The job offers we use vary on six attributes, as seen in Table 1. Three of these attributes deal with various aspects of location: nation, region, and city size. The region attribute captures the difference between inland and coastal areas, with prior literature suggesting most job candidates would prefer coastal areas given the concentration of opportunities and social networks for both nations (Faist 1999, Keren et al. 2003. The city size attribute is either large or medium and, for China only, the respondent's hometown. City size helps us explore the social network effects larger cities provide, whereas the hometown choice helps us evaluate the impact of family ties on the decision process. We combine country with region and city size to acknowledge no \"medium\" cities with STEM jobs exist in China, and no \"hometown\" exists in the United States (see Table 1 for the final levels of the combined country-city attribute). For concreteness, we provide varied examples of particular cities in the questionnaire, rotating several examples of each location-size level throughout the questionnaire (see Appendix for an example). Capturing managerial status, the job titles vary based on the level of responsibility from Research Scientist/ Engineer with no subordinates, a Manager with up to 10 subordinates, and a Director with more than 10 subordinates. The employer ownership attribute measures the desirability of public-sector versus private-sector positions. The final element, salary, has five levels ranging from $20,000/year to $120,000/year. This range is based on available salary reports for STEM PhDs in the United States and China (2006 NSF Survey of Doctorate Recipient , Derkach 2009). The Chinese job offers implicitly include the value of housing allowance, a common perk for returnees (Keren 2003, p.99). Given the attribute levels in Table 1, we use Sawtooth software (an industry standard) to generate two 25-question balanced and orthogonal designs, one for the pairwise judgments and one for the single-job evaluations. All respondents answered both sets of questions from these designs. The true value of a dollar earned depends on its relative purchasing power in the local economy. For example, the IMF estimates that $1 in the United States buys as many goods and services as 65 cents would in China. To account for this effect, we also make the salary variable country specific. Although the private jobs we consider are quite comparable across the two countries, public-sector jobs clearly are not. Therefore, we also make the Public employer-type marginal utility country specific. For later simulation purposes, we also estimate the average salary in each location using secondary sources. Our average salary estimate for the United States ($75,000) is from the 2006 NSF Survey of Doctorate Recipients. Our average salary estimate for China ($26,785) is from Derkach (2009), who reports a 2008 survey by the global HR consulting firm, Hewitt Associates, of compensation packages for Chinese returnees. She finds that returnees are paid less and receive fewer benefits than foreign expatriates but are better compensated than locals. The final section of the questionnaire consists of 16 demographic and attitudinal questions. Based on the findings from previous studies of this population, we focus our questions on the following issues: family description, length of stay in the United States, intention to return home following graduation, entrepreneurial ambitions, and pride in one's homeland. To measure pride, we use the two scales introduced by Smith and Kim (2006), who set out to measure nationalism from the perspective of general national pride and domain-specific national pride. The scale items are included in Appendix A2, and they are modified relative to Smith and Kim to be between 0 and 1 by dividing by the maximum possible value. After carrying out extensive testing of the survey design for understandability and realism of the generated job profiles, we distributed the online survey to STEM PhDs with PRC citizenship at three large research universities-one each in Illinois, California, and North Carolina. The incentive for filling out the survey was between $20 and $30. The overall response rate for these surveys was about 45%. Any survey attracts some respondents who either do not understand the instructions or do not pay attention to the task. To filter out such respondents, we deleted a few dozen responses filled out too quickly or too slowly (faster than 10 minutes / slower than 24 hours for the entire survey) and responses that did not demonstrate with enough variation an understanding of the scales (either accepted all jobs in the single-item evaluations or never deviated much from indifference in the pairwise task). Our final sample consists of 289 respondents. Table A1 in the Appendix summarizes the respondent characteristics."}, {"section_title": "IV. Model, Estimation Methodology, and Parameter Estimates", "text": "Our goal is to estimate a random-utility model at the individual level while capturing similarities in preferences among respondents with similar demographic characteristics. We use a standard Bayesian modeling approach with a hierarchical prior (Lenk et al. 1996, Rossi et al. 2005). The only non-standard challenge we need to overcome is that each respondent both evaluated singlejob profiles and expressed relative strength of preference within pairs of profiles. To pool these responses together into a single preference estimate, we model latent utility of each job profile (whether in a pairwise or single-concept task) as a linear regression on attributes, and assume the model parameters are invariant across the two modalities of preference elicitation up to a single scaling parameter. We explain this pooling strategy next. Consider a particular respondent and start with his N single-profile evaluations first. The nth profile is characterized by a row attribute vector X 1,n , and its evaluation is a scalar Y 1,n . Our model of this evaluation is a linear regression with iid Normal errors: Now consider the K pairwise preference judgments of the same respondent. The kth pair of profiles is characterized by a difference-in-attributes row vector 2, is the jth member of the kth pair. Analogously, the relative strength of preference for the second member of the kth pair of profiles is a scalar 2, , where Y 2,k,j is the latent evaluation of the jth member of the kth pair. The model of each latent evaluation is again a linear regression with iid Normal errors: Note that all of the parameters in equation 2 are potentially different from those in equation 1, so the two response modalities can involve a different amount of noise, different baseline evaluations, and potentially even different marginal evaluations of each attribute. Given equation 2, the model of each relative preference for the second profile in pair k is also a linear regression, with double the variance of equation 2and the constant term \u03b8 cancelled out: To accommodate this difference-in-evaluation coding of Y 2,k , we shift and rescale our questionnaire's 10-point scale such that 5 corresponds to 0, +10 corresponds to +50, and 0 corresponds to -50. Thus both latent utilities Y 1,n and Y 2,k,j can be considered as measured on a similar 100-point scale. To pool data across both modalities of preference elicitation, we assume c \u03b3 \u03b2 = for a scalar c that we estimate (and we hope turns out positive). This scaling is equivalent to assuming the relative importance weights of the different attributes do not depend on the mode of elicitation. However, the scale of the noise \u03b5 can still vary, as can the overall usage of the measurement scale. A parameter vector (\u03b1, \u03b2, c, \u03c3 1 , \u03c3 2 ) thus captures each respondent. To pool data across respondents j=1,2,\u2026J while allowing for heterogeneity of preferences, we allow all elements of the individual parameter vector (\u03b1, \u03b2, c, \u03c3 1 , \u03c3 2 ) to vary across respondents. At the individual level, respondent j is modeled as where X 1,n is a row vector of length A of coded attributes in the nth single-concept evaluation task. X 2,k is a row vector of length A of differences in coded attributes between the second and the first concept in the kth pairwise preference task. The variance of the random component of each respondent's utility, as well as the intercept \u03b1 and scaling parameter c, are all idiosyncratic (i.e., independent of other people's parameters). We capture this idiosyncrasy with standard conjugate mutually independent priors: In contrast, we assume the deterministic component of utility is correlated across people and related to individual characteristics. We model this relationship with a hierarchical prior following Lenk et al. (1996). Please see Rossi et al. (2005) for an overview of hierarchical linear models. A row vector of M characteristics Z j characterizes each respondent, and respondents with similar characteristics tend to have similar preferences following a multivariate regression: where V \u03b2 is an A x A matrix and \u0394 is an M x A matrix. The baseline parameter from which individuals deviate according to their characteristics Z is the first row of \u0394 in that we set the first element of each Z j to unity. To complete the model, we use standard conjugate priors for V \u03b2 and \u0394, namely, Although these priors allow us to add a priori scale information in S 0 and effect information in \u0394 0 , we try to let the data speak, and use proper but diffuse priors. Our specific settings are   2  2  0  0  0  0  0  0  0   3,  10,  0,  100,  3,  Please see Rossi et al. (2005) for a detailed description of setting up the Gibbs sampler for a hierarchical linear model."}, {"section_title": "Estimation results", "text": "We ran the Gibbs sampler for 15,000 iterations, discarding the first 5,000 as burn-in iterations (it takes a while for the sampler to navigate to the area of the parameter space with enough posterior mass) and using the remaining 10,000 draws to conduct our counterfactual exercises. Table 2 summarizes the estimated marginal utilities and shows both their explained and unexplained heterogeneity in the population of respondents. We estimate the marginal utility (\u03b2) of all attributes relative to a baseline attribute level fixed by convention to zero. The baseline profile is [China Home, Private firm, Researcher status], and the interpretation of \u03b2 coefficients is always relative to this baseline. For example, the average \u03b2 CHINA_COAST of 3.66 means a location in a large Chinese coastal city is valued 3.66 points (on the 100-point preference scale used in single-job evaluations) more than a location in a hometown. The salary is an exception to this coding as it enters the utility linearly. Therefore, the average { \u03b2 SALARY_US , \u03b2 SALARY_CHINA } means respondents value a $10,000 raise 6.42 points on average if the job is in the United States and 6.87 points if the job is in China. We conclude that the average respondent cares about salary more than other attributes, prefers working in the Chinese public sector to working in the U.S. public sector, and prefers a managerial position. In terms of geographical preference, the favorite location of the average respondent is a large coastal city in China, preferable even over his or her hometown. On the flipside, the average respondent would rather work anywhere in the United States instead of the inner provinces of China. Within the United States, the favorite location is also a large coastal city (shown as \"baseline\" from which other U.S. locations incur additional marginal utilities). Not reported in Table 2 is our estimate of the regression error \u03c3 1 . It varies across respondents with a mean and median of about 12 points (on the 100-point preference scale used in single-job evaluations).  \u0394 m,a ). The shaded cells show the top dozen largest \"dummy-on-dummy\" effects (magnitudes are mutually comparable because Z is either 0 or 1 or a proportion between 0 and 1 in the case of pride). Although the average preferences tell a potentially interesting story, this averaging masks a lot of heterogeneity across the population. The spread of preferences is most marked for the U.S. baseline preference. Figure 1 illustrates this heterogeneity by computing a willingness to accept a salary reduction in order to stay in the United States (large coastal city) instead of going back to China (to a large coastal city), implied by the posterior means of \u03b2 j,SALARY_US and \u03b2 j,US , and \u03b2 j,CHINA_COAST .The median respondent has a slight preference (about $6,800) toward China, but a significant portion of the population (as evidenced by the thick right tail of the distribution) are willing to accept a large salary reduction to stay in the United States. Analogous histograms can be computed for all other parameters of interest. In the appendix ( Figure A1), we produce a histogram of the implied purchasing power parity (PPP). The mean PPP across respondents is 0.92, and the distribution has a thick left tail. We conclude that our population does not agree with the IMF estimate of 0.65 and instead behaves almost as if a dollar in the United States buys roughly as much as the same dollar buys in China. Table 2 shows both the variation across people explained by the individual characteristics (Z) and the remaining unexplained variation captured by the magnitude (standard deviation) of  Histogram of (\u03b2 US_COAST_LARGE -\u03b2 CHINA_COAST_LARGE )/ \u03b2 SALARY_US in the population, computed at the posterior means of each individual's coefficients.

We find that much of the heterogeneity in preferences is unexplained, especially the baseline preference for the United States. However, we also detect systematic relationships between preferences and personal characteristics: the bottom part of Table 2 shows the posterior mean of \u0394 that captures marginal effects of the characteristics on the \u03b2 parameters (see equation 6). We now turn to these findings. Analogous to the attributes themselves, the interaction between gender and marital status is also coded relative to a baseline attribute level [Single Male] subsumed in the constant. All of the other characteristics are either dummy variables or enter the regression directly (as is the case for age and our two national pride measures). The largest correlation we find between a preference and a demographic or attitudinal characteristic is the negative correlation between General China Pride and the preference for locating in the United States. The results in Table 2 imply people who scored the highest on our general pride index (score: 0.92) rated all U.S. jobs about 11.8 points [16.9*(0.9-0.2)] lower than people who scored lowest on the index (0.2). The second largest \"effect\" is the positive correlation between being a single female and a preference for staying in the United States: holding everything else equal, Table 2 shows that single females rated U.S.-based jobs 9.53 points higher on average than otherwise identical Chinese jobs. Married females, on the other hand, prefer medium coastal cities and strongly dislike Chinese coastal cities. Other large effects (the top dozen are highlighted in Table 2) include a predictable correlation between being from an inland province and a reduction in distaste for an inland job location, and currently studying/working in either Illinois or North Carolina and preferring to remain in central parts of the U.S. rather than going to coastal areas. Although the marginal effects (\u0394) are interesting in their ability to suggest particular personal characteristics as sources of heterogeneity in return migration, simulations of every individual's decision best answer the research questions we ask, because all the individual characteristics are mutually correlated. For example, if single females were to also feel the highest general pride in China, the two largest effects would effectively cancel each other out. The important take-away from the estimation results is that the estimation flexibly accounted for both population heterogeneity in \u03b2 and for correlations of \u03b2 over individuals and demographic groups. All of the information needed for predicting individual behavior is included in the posterior distributions of each \u03b2 j and \u03c3 j , which we use in our simulations, discussed next."}, {"section_title": "V. Simulations to Answer Counterfactual Questions", "text": "Each simulation we conduct starts with a definition of the job-market alternatives available to the job seekers. For example, in our first simulation, we consider the four choices for privateemployer researcher positions located in large cities in the following locations: China Coastal, China Inland, U.S. Coastal, and U.S. Inland. Given a job market and a particular person, our goal is to compute the expected choice probability for each alternative implied by that person's (\u03b2 j ,\u03c3 j,1 ) parameters. To account for estimation error, we compute the probability separately for each of the 10,000 post-burn-in posterior draws of (\u03b2 j ,\u03c3 j,1 ) and then average over the draws. To account for the random component of utility given a particular (\u03b2 j ,\u03c3 j,1 ) draw, we average over 100 draws of the random utility \u03b5 drawn iid from Normal(0, \u03c3 j,1 ) for each alternative. Therefore, we are joining single-alternative utility functions into a four-alternative multinomial probit model (Hausman and Wise 1978) with a diagonal covariance structure. The diagonality of our covariance implies our simulations suffer from a problem akin to the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) at the individual level Srinivasan 1978, McFadden et al. 1976). To guard against erroneous results that might creep in due to IIA, we first make sure the choice set always includes the same number of China-and U.S.-based alternatives, thereby not stacking the random-utility deck for either country. Second, we vary the size of \u03c3 j from the estimated value (whereby the random utility \u03b5 is interpreted as utility due to attributes that influence eventual choice but are unobserved by the analyst) down to zero (whereby the random utility \u03b5 is interpreted as error in our measurement of the true utility X\u03b2 that drives eventual behavior). All of our results report a band of choice probabilities arising from these different assumptions about \u03b5, and the reader can thus clearly see which results are driven by \u03b5 and which are robust to its inclusion in the utility. One way to think about our simulation strategy is to imagine each person generating one million pseudo-people, each with his own (\u03b2 j ,\u03b5 j,1 ) vector. Assume each of the million pseudopeople picks his utility-maximizing alternative, and the original \"real-person\" choice probability is the average choice across his million alter egos. In the statistical literature, this kind of posterior predictive simulation is the standard approach (Rossi et al. 2005). The pseudo-person approach allows us to also assess the precision of the choice probabilities by computing the standard deviation of the probabilities across different draws. We now turn to the specific simulations and the results. Simulation 1: Our estimation results illustrated in Figure 1 indicate a majority of Chinese STEM PhDs would actually prefer to locate in China instead of the United States if nominal annual salaries were similar enough between the two countries. However, current American STEM jobs pay, on average, at least $50,000 more and our results also indicate that nearly all Chinese STEM PhDs are quite sensitive to salary when it comes to the job-decision process. Does the salary difference indeed explain the low return rates of approximately 10%? How many more graduates would return to China if the current wage disparity between the two labor markets decreased (as is likely with growing upward pressure on Chinese wages due to rising productivity and long-term appreciation of the yuan)? For this simulation, we consider researcher positions located in large cities in the following locations-China Coastal, China Inland, U.S. Coastal, and U.S. Inland-and we split the potential returnees according to gender. Figure 2 displays the results, and the reported probabilities of return can be considered statistically accurate within a few percentage points (Table A3 in the Appendix shows the overall predicted return rates and their posterior standard errors). Figure 2 contains both of the main findings of this paper. First, the current salary disparity explains the current low return rates well and lends credence to the simulations that include the estimated random utility shocks: the model's return prediction at +$50K salary gap is 8.4% regardless of gender. If the salary gap shrunk to half, the model predicts that we would see more than three times as many returnees-about 27%. However, not all Chinese STEM PhDs have the same return tendency, as we discuss next. Our second main finding is that females are much less likely than men to return. This difference in behavior is not too acute at the present gap of about $50,000, but it will become more noticeable as the gap narrows in the future. For example, we predict that should the gap narrow to half of today's level, only about 23% of females would return to China as compared to about 30% of men. Table 2 suggests Table   0 10  We do not provide a separate figure for the results of the present simulation because we find very little difference from Figure 2. When we compute the additional predicted returns as a function of the salary difference between the United States and China, we find the number to be solidly below 8% for all salary-gap levels. In other words, no more than an additional 8% of Chinese STEM PhDs would return to their homeland if U.S. coastal jobs became unavailable. However, note that that a scarcity of U.S. coastal jobs would exacerbate the exodus effect of a decrease of the salary gap. For example, scarcity of U.S. coastal jobs coupled with a halving of the salary gap would result in about 35% of Chinese STEM PhDs returning to China. One counter-measure that might be considered is offering a salary premium for jobs located outside the major urban hubs on the U.S. coasts. To assess the impact of such a measure, we conduct another simulation, this time focused solely on location choice within the United States. Simulation 3: How many more Chinese STEM PhDs would locate in the inland portion of the United States if they received a financial incentive? This question is especially relevant to managers of inland firms and research institutions. To answer this question, we simulate choices from the following: U.S. Coastal Large City, U.S. Coastal Medium City, U.S. Inland Large City, and U.S. Inland Medium City. Again, we focus on researcher jobs in the private sector (as in simulations 1 and 2) to make the results comparable. Figure 4 shows the impact of inland firms paying more than coastal firms, focusing on the simulations with a random-utility component. Another way to interpret this simulation is as that of a Chinese STEM PhD who wants to stay in the United States and receives job offers from all four U.S. regions we've mentioned in our study. The overall result is that moving Chinese researchers and engineers around the country does not require a large change in annual salary. For instance, a $10,000 premium relative to U.S. coastal job salaries would be enough to bring the majority of the respondents we surveyed to U.S. inland regions compared to only 45% of them settling there at salary parity. Even more encouragingly for the likes of Raleigh-Durham or Austin, a sizeable proportion of Chinese STEM PhDs even prefers a medium inland city over a large one. Who prefers medium-sized inland cities over larger ones? Table 2 suggests the students already studying at inland universities. Indeed, Figure 4 shows that they are about 10% more likely to stay in inland U.S. locations at all salary levels. Note that many such students exist because the top seven universities in terms of number of PhDs granted to foreigners are located outside the West Coast and Northeastern corridor. 7 We conclude that although the loss of coastal opportunities outright could increase return migration somewhat (Simulation 2), Chinese STEM Ph.D.s' sensitivity to salary means companies and universities located in the Midwest and Southeast can keep them in the United States and attract them with salary premiums (relative to coastal jobs) as modest as $10,000. Simulation 4: Our next simulation addresses the question of status. Iredale et al. (2003) reportthat Chinese STEM Ph.D.s would like to be managers, but they perceive a glass ceiling keeping them out of management in the U.S. job market. We confirm that the average Chinese STEM Ph.D. would prefer to be a manager or even a director instead of a \"mere\" researcher. The glass ceiling clearly does not exist in China 8 , so we ask how many more graduates would return if all Chinese job opportunities offered more managerial roles. To answer this question, we simulate a { China Coastal, China Inland, U.S. Coastal, US Inland } job market analogous to that in Simulation 1 (all large cities). All alternatives involve a job in the private sector, and all U.S. alternatives involve a researcher (low status) position. In line with the status quo, we assume all of the U.S. jobs pay $50,000 more than Chinese jobs. Figure 5 shows the results, clearly illustrating that our population of respondents does not value status much. Although the returns to China would indeed increase as a result of more managerial opportunity there, we find the effect would be modest. The return rate would rise from roughly 9 % to about 12 %. Interestingly, we find no difference between the director and manager levels of responsibility. Overall, we conclude that managerial opportunity in China is unlikely to cause a major drain of talent from the U.S. STEM job market. Simulation 5: Besides segmenting the respondents based on demographics, we also consider their perceptions on nationalism. In particular, we use the two scales introduced by Smith and Kim (2006) who set out to measure nationalism from the perspective of general national pride and domain-specific national pride. The scale items are included in Appendix A2, and they are modified relative to Smith and Kim to be between 0 and 1 by dividing by the maximum possible value. For this simulation, we split our respondents into \"Generally Proud\"-defined as weakly above median on \"General Pride\" and \"Others\"-and essentially re-ran Simulation 1. Interestingly, differences in an individual's general national pride are not correlated with Results of a simulation with four alternatives: China Coastal, China Inland, US Coastal, US Inland. All alternatives involve a job in the private sector, and all U.S. alternatives involves a Researcher (low status) position, and the salary difference is held constant at U.S. jobs paying $50K more than Chinese jobs (Both US alternatives pay $80K, both Chinese alternatives pay $30K). The curves represent the proportion of respondents predicted to choose either China Coastal or China Inland. The solid lines are based on expected utility only; the dotted lines are based on expected utility plus a random component with variance estimated from variations in questionnaire responses. The shaded areas illustrate the possible predictions as the variance of the random component is increased from zero to the estimated value."}, {"section_title": "Job title in China (vs. Researcher in the United States)", "text": "Predicted proportion of respondents that return to China demographics-all correlations are less than 0.15 in absolute value, including the correlation with being a single female. Therefore, the split on pride is different from other splits considered so far. Figure 6 shows the result of the simulation. We find that Chinese STEM PhDs that report higher degrees of general national pride are more likely to return home across all salary levels. Moreover, the difference in return rates grows as the salary gap narrows. For example, should the salary gap shrink to half the current level, 33% of those proud of China would return as compared to 23% of those not proud. We propose that the pride in China is likely to rise as the salary gap narrows, because both are consequences of growth and progress. Therefore, this simulation suggests that halving the salary gap may actually quadruple returns, not just triple them (as Simulation 1 suggested). If we compare these results with Figure 2, we also note the difference should even be noticeable at the current salary differential between the two nations. This result seems to give credence to previous studies that indicate giving back to one's  Figure 2. The information is broken down by pride as defined by weakly above-median general national pride scale of Smith and Kim (2006)."}, {"section_title": "Salary difference ($1K) U.S. -China Predicted proportion that returns to China", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Not proud of China", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Proud of China", "text": "homeland is an important factor in the decision to return home (Albert and Hazen 2005). The implications of this finding point toward the need to cater recruitment strategies to address this need, particularly for firms that lack major offices or R&D centers in China. Using ties that an organization has to China, through collaborative research, supply chains, or consumer markets, can emphasize to potential STEM talent the indirect contribution they could make to a growing and prosperous homeland. Simulation 6: At the end of our online survey, we asked each respondent, \"What is your current attitude about returning to China?\" on a scale from \"Definitely will go back and have made arrangements to do so\" to \"Definitely will not go back.\" Using our analysis, we can relate these intentions to predicted behavior, effectively translating the meaning of the response scale into a true return probability. We have done so in Table 3 for the current salary gap between the United States and China, as well as for half the current level, in a market setting identical to the first simulation (Simulation 1) .  Table 3 shows that responses to intention questions are clearly informative but generally biased upward. Specifically, \"Definitely\" does not mean \"100% probability\" but rather \"23% probability.\" Interestingly, \"Can't really say now\" is a polite way of saying \"Probably not.\" The results for all salary levels are displayed in Figure 7. For clarity, Figure 7 only shows the results of simulations with the random component of utility.  The intention results also tie our study back to direct surveys: if we generously interpret the top three most positive responses as an intention to go back to China, we find that about half of our respondents intend to go back, in line with prior surveys. Thus our analysis explains the discrepancy between stated intentions and behavior as a mis-calibration of the respondents regarding their own sensitivity to salary. The mis-calibration is likely a result of a focusing illusion (Schkade and Kahneman 1998) whereby respondents over-estimate the importance of a focal attribute in a question and forget they derive utility from several other attributes as well."}, {"section_title": "VI. Discussion", "text": "In six simulations, we demonstrate the ability of conjoint analysis-a survey technique pioneered in marketing to measure demand-to answer important managerial and policy questions about return migration of Chinese STEM PhDs. By flexibly estimating demand for jobs as a function of job characteristics (location, status, salary, and employer ownership), we can answer counterfactual questions beyond the range of available migration data. For example, we can estimate what would happen if the existing salary gap between China and the United States narrowed. By estimating the demand on the individual level, we can relate predicted behavior to demographic characteristics and attitudes. For example, we can predict who is more likely to stay in the United States or who is more likely to settle in a smaller city. The ability of conjoint analysis to predict demand beyond the available range of data and to do it at the individual level makes it a useful decision tool. We designed our simulations to answer several questions relevant to managers trying to attract Chinese STEM talent, as well as to officials setting U.S. immigration and technology policies. We turn to our findings next. Retaining foreign doctoral graduates in science and engineering is critical for future competitiveness of the U.S. economy because foreign-born students account for a large proportion-in some fields, almost two-thirds-of doctoral degrees granted. Chinese nationals are the largest group in terms of the number of doctorates earned in the United States, so understanding what drives Chinese STEM PhDs in their decision to stay in the United States or go back to China after graduation is important. Until now, they have been rather hesitant hai gui, with only about one in 10 returning. Our analysis explains the hesitation not as some sort of inherent fondness for the United States, but as an issue of money. We find that if salaries were the same everywhere, most Chinese STEM PhDs (about 65%) would prefer to return. The increased purchasing power of the dollar in China partially drives this preference, but we do not find the perceived purchasing power back home to be too different in the minds of our respondents. Our analysis of dollar-based salaries allows us to back out the perceived purchasing-power parity in our respondent population. In other words, we can identify a preference for China as a place separately from a preference for China as a place to spend dollars. We find a lot of heterogeneity in the perceived PPP, perhaps stemming from heterogeneity in the basket of goods purchased. In terms of magnitude, our respondents perceive China as a more expensive place than the IMF considers it: the average respondent perceives a dollar in the United States to be worth about 90 cents in China, whereas the IMF puts the figure to about 65 cents. This discrepancy might be the result of a western lifestyle likely adopted by U.S.-trained professionals and their preference for coastal Chinese cities, where living expenses often rival, or even exceed in the case of Shanghai or Hong Kong, those of major U.S. cities. That being said, the prevailing salaries between the two nations are not the same, and Chinese STEM PhDs can expect to earn about $50,000 more in the United States than in China. When we simulate location choice under this salary disparity, we closely match the current return rates of 8%-10% as reported by Finn (2010). The same cannot be said about prior surveys that directly asked about return intentions and predicted the return rate to be over 40%. In summary, this study provides further evidence for the growing consensus in marketing, sociology, and medicine that conjoint analysis is better than simpler, direct surveys at uncovering true preferences. When we ask direct return-intention questions, we also find large percentages of Chinese STEM PhDs who say they intend to return, and more positive intentions correlate with higher predicted return rates. However, the intentions are all too optimistic relative to the return rates. For example, we estimate that only 23% of Chinese STEM PhDs who say they will definitely go back and have made arrangements to do so actually do return based on their revealed preferences. Our analysis explains the discrepancy between stated intentions and behavior as a mis-calibration of the respondents regarding their own sensitivity to the prevailing salary gap. Our results indicate that given current salaries, U.S. policymakers can continue to safely assume a vast majority (about 90%) of Chinese science and engineering talent emerging from PhD programs who receive U.S. job offers will remain and contribute to the economy. However, China's higher relative economic growth and eventual appreciation of the yuan will undoubtedly reduce the salary gap in the near future. We find that return rates are quite elastic in the salary gap, and a significant reduction of the gap is likely to result in many more hai gui. For example, when the gap shrinks to half of today's level, we predict returns to China among STEM PhDs will increase threefold to about 30% of graduates. Note that our findings do not preclude the migration of highly experienced individuals, those 10-15 years removed from their PhD programs, who can often command salaries that equal or exceed those offered in the United States, or those with entrepreneurial ambitions, strong connections back home, and ready access to investment capital. Anecdotal examples from these two populations have garnered increasing worry among certain business leaders, particularly in the tech sector, that a brain drain from the United States is underway (Wadhwa et al 2009). So what can policymakers do to discourage the Chinese postgraduate population from returning to home? First, the same sensitivity to salary that will cause the increased returns can also be used to retain talent in the United States: the government can provide relatively modest cash incentives or tax breaks for those scientists and engineers who decide to stay. More controversially but also more affordably, attracting demographic groups who are more likely to stay might be possible. For example, we find women tend to remain in the United States more often than men. Conjoint analysis allows us not only to detect the difference in behavior between identifiable student groups, but also to estimate the magnitude of the difference in predicted return. We predict that should the salary gap narrow to $25,000, only 23% of females would return to China as compared to about 30% of men. Other targeted recruitment policies could be evaluated with a larger sample of students. For example (not reported in detail), we find that postdocs and students with children seem to return less often than average. Retaining Chinese STEM PhDs may become more difficult if U.S. job opportunities in science and engineering shift to regions outside the West Coast and Northeast, away from traditional centers of the Chinese diaspora that provide important social and cultural benefits to recent immigrants and their families. We find that eliminating U.S. coastal STEM jobs indeed would result in more returnees. The magnitude of the increase depends crucially on the salary difference between the United States and China: at its current level, we predict a modest increase of about 4% of additional returns. However, the additional returns would double if the salary gap shrunk to $25,000; as much as an additional 8% of Chinese STEM PhDs would return if U.S. coastal jobs became unavailable. One policy we considered to counter this possibility was raising science and engineering salaries in the inland U.S. locations, perhaps through a targeted tax break. Since we find the Chinese STEM PhDs are quite salary sensitive, this idea is promising, and we estimate that modest salary increases in this region would be enough to shift the talent there, and many individuals would even be ready and willing to settle in smaller cities. What should managers of U.S. companies and universities based in the Midwest and Southeast do to attract Chinese STEM PhDs to their regions? First, the salary sensitivity implies that modest salary premiums can work. Second, we find that Chinese STEM PhDs that already attend universities in these regions are about 10% more likely to stay there, at all salary levels. One worry U.S. policymakers may have about persuading Chinese STEM PhDs to remain in the United States is the perceived difficulty of foreign doctoral graduates getting positions in management. In contrast, returnees are highly sought after for management positions back in China, so those who would like a management position are more likely to return. What U.S. policymakers could do to break the perceived glass ceiling is unclear, but luckily for them, the worry, we find, is unfounded. Management positions back in China do attract more returnees than researcher positions, but the effect is small. We also test the predictive power of two national pride scales developed by Kim and Smith (2006). Our results indicate that \"domain-specific\" pride in China's sports, scientific achievements, or armed forces does not correlate with return migration much. In contrast, Chinese STEM PhDs who feel more \"general\" pride (i.e., overt nationalism) are much more likely to return to China. As a result, any firm or organization that lacks a physical presence in China that could absorb this talent should develop a recruiting strategy that emphasizes the ties it has to the region and how it contributes to the country's increasing prosperity through its activities. By showing how potential employees can \"give back to their homeland\" while still remaining in the United States, recruiting managers should have increased success with this part of the Chinese STEM population. We also find a host of personal characteristics that might theoretically influence migration decisions, but do not, in fact, correlate strongly with a location preference. For example, older students are neither more nor less likely to stay in the United States, and neither are students who spend more time in the United States. If anything, spending more years in the United States reduces its attractiveness to our population of respondents. Taken together, our results have important implications for the study of return migration both for Chinese STEM professionals in the United States and highly skilled migrants in traditional host nations as a whole. In our application of conjoint analysis, we have developed a powerful predictive tool simulating the migratory decision process through a realistic job search. We believe researchers, managers, and policymakers can adapt this approach for other highly skilled migrant populations both in the United States and other host nations. Future research on other nationalities can further test the applicability of conjoint analysis to migration by comparing estimated return rates to the actual return rates found in Finn (2010). Return rates among the next three highest contributor nations-India, United Kingdom, and South Koreavary widely, so recreating these return rates in a similar study would help test the robustness of this approach across other nationalities.
