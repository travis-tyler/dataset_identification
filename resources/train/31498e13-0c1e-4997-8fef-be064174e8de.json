Chart of state cancer plans and whether they acknowledged living in a 66 rural area as a risk factor for not getting a mammography screening. INTRODUCTION Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death and the second most common form of cancer in the United States (Lemon, Zapka, Clemow, Estabrook, & Fletcher, 2006). More than 182,000 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2002, and 41,000 women died from the disease in that same year. Currently 63.7% of breast cancer is diagnosed at the localized stage (before the tumor has metastasized and spread to other parts of the body) with a survival rate of 97.9% (American Cancer Society, 2006a). Early detection of breast cancer can be attributed to utilization of mammography screening and the high awareness of breast cancer symptoms in the population. In the United States, more than seven billion dollars per year has been estimated to have been spent on the treatment of breast cancer (Centers for Disease Control andPrevention, 2006/2007). The reason for the high amount of money spent on researching breast cancer is that earlier detection saves lives and medical expenses. Yet, despite the overwhelming endorsement of mammography screening as an effective means of combating breast cancer, universal adherence to routine screening is still a distant goal. Mammography screening has been universally recognized as the best method effectively to detect breast cancer (Anderson, Smith, Meishchke, Bowen, & Urban, 2003). Mammography is defined as \"an x-ray of the breast taken by a machine that presses against the breast while the picture is taken\" (O'Malley et al., 2001). According to a study by Anderson et al. (2003), \"Screening refers to the testing of asymptomatic individuals for the detection of occult disease.\" Mammography is performed for two primary purposes: screening and diagnosis. Screening mammography is used to detect a breast abnormality before it can be detected by physical examination in a woman without breast cancer symptoms. Diagnostic mammography is a procedure a woman undergoes if she has exhibited a symptom such as a lump, which may indicate the presence of breast cancer or whose screening mammogram indicated a possible cancerous growth. The latest American Cancer Society Guidelines recommend that women at average risk should begin annual mammography at age 40 and should continue for as long as a woman is in good health (American Cancer Society, 2006a). Concordantly, the National Cancer Institute recommends that women should begin mammography screening at age 40 and be screened every one or two years, unless they are at higher than average risk. The higher risk may be due to a personal history of breast cancer, family history, genetics, long term use of hormone therapy, body weight, physical activity level, breast density and alcohol use (National Cancer Institute, 2006). Despite these recommendations, many women neglect to adhere to the recommendation of annual screenings. Ethnicity plays an important role in breast cancer. White women are more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than are women of any other race or ethnicity in the United States (Ries et al., 2005;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2005). However, African American women are more likely than other women in the country to die from the disease. According to recent trends, new cases of breast cancer diagnosed each year (incidence) have remained stable or decreased significantly during the past ten years for white, African American, Hispanic and Native American Women (Centers for Disease Control andPrevention, 2006/2007). The two subgroups which have the lowest prevalence of mammography in the past two years are women who lack health insurance (40.2%) and immigrant women who have lived in the U.S. for less than ten years (52.3%) (American Cancer Society, 2006a). Lower participation in mammography screening among poorer women is very disconcerting, for these women are more likely to have their breast cancers initially detected at an advanced stage when treatment is less effective. Past studies have examined factors which influence mammography screening rates. These factors include physician recommendation (O'Malley et al., 2001), a woman's specific cancer worry and its impact on mammography adherence (Diefenbach, Miller, & Daly, 1999), perceived barriers to screening among different demographic groups (Austin, Ahmad, McNally, & Stewart, 2002;O'Malley et al., 2001), the influence of a first degree family relative breast cancer diagnosis on other family members (Lemon et al., 2006), and the associated risks and costs of screening (Humphrey, Helfand, Chan, & Woolf, 2002). Menck and Mills (2001) identified elderly (65 years of age and older), Hispanic, and African American females; as well as those women residing in non-urban areas as high-risk groups who do not elect to use mammography screening (Menck & Mills, 2001). There has been little research that compares the pattern of mammography screening rates in female populations living in either urban or rural counties. The purpose of this study is threefold. The first is to provide a comprehensive literature review of mammography which includes the following information: history of its use as a breast cancer prevention strategy; how specific populations are targeted for its use; and the factors that impact a woman using mammography screening. The second purpose is to examine the literature for studies on the availability or accessibility of mammography facilities in Georgia and North Carolina. The final purpose is to assess whether there are differential mammography screening rates in either urban or rural counties located in Georgia and North Carolina and, if so, how state cancer plans address this finding. The objectives of this project are: \u2022 To review the literature on mammography screening rates and the factors which impact the use and success of mammography screening interventions; \u2022 To analyze data on mammography screening and determine rates of use in both urban and rural counties in the states of Georgia and North Carolina; \u2022 To compare the mammography use rates in both urban and rural counties in Georgia and North Carolina. This study will use the chi square test to determine if any differences are statistically significant where a value of .05 or less is significant; \u2022 To determine the number of certified mammography facilities in both urban and rural counties of Georgia and North Carolina; and \u2022 To review the state cancer plans of the eight states included in Health and Human Services Region IV (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee) to see if they identify living in a rural county as a risk for not getting screened. The aim of this study is to test the null hypothesis: There is no significant difference between mammography screening rates of women in either urban or rural counties of Georgia and North Carolina. The alternative hypothesis is: There is a significant difference between the mammography screening rates of women living in either urban or rural counties of Georgia and North Carolina. Successfully determining mammography use rates will assist different health organizations strategically target at-risk groups and develop more effective interventions. The prospective data and information gathered will allow modifications in program design and function so that positive contributions can be maximized and negative effects minimized or avoided entirely. The implications of this study could be applied to other cancers in which the success of treatment depends on early detection from screening. The reduction of late-stage cancer diagnosis and prevention of breast cancer mortality is a worthy public health goal."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER II REVIEW OF LITERATURE", "text": "The discussion and examination of mammography screening use rates in either urban or rural counties, as well as the subsequent development of an intervention to target at-risk groups, would be incomplete without full exploration of all major content areas included in a comprehensive literature review.

The first individual to contribute to the development of mammography as a screening device was Albert Salomon, a surgeon who used radiography to detect the spread of a breast tumor to auxiliary lymph nodes in 1913 (Gold, Bassett, & Widoff, 1990). Mammography was later pioneered by Stafford L. Warren, a radiologist at Rochester Memorial Hospital, New York, who used it with 119 patients in combination with a \"new\" fine grain double-emulsion Kodak film which helped clarify the presence of tumors or abnormal cell growth in breast tissue in 1930 (Bassett, 1991;Gold et al., 1990). As a result of using the new film in the mammography process, Warren only made interpretative errors in eight of the 119 cases he examined. Hospital developed a direct film mammography technique (Bassett, 1991) which was presented at this conference. His new technique was used in a nationwide mammography study in which 24 institutions participated. The results of the study confirmed that 1) The technique of mammography, as developed and taught by Egan, could be learned by other radiologists 2) X-rays of acceptable quality could be produced 3) Using mammography one would be able to discriminate between benign and malignant lesions and finally, 4) Mammography could be used to screen for cancer in asymptomatic women (Clark, Copeland, & Egan, 1965). The ability to screen for breast cancer in asymptomatic women, or those that appear to have no breast problems (American Cancer Society, 2006b), is crucial for catching breast cancer at an early stage. When breast cancer is detected at an early stage, the five year survival rate is 98% (American Cancer Society, 2006c). The first mammography machine was developed in 1966. Prior to this time, mammographic images were produced by simply using a standard x-ray machine (GE Healthcare, 2006). During this same time period, 1963-1966 and Sam Shapiro conducted the first randomized controlled study of breast cancer screening under the auspices of the Health Insurance Plan (HIP) of New York (Bassett, 1991;Gold et al., 1990). Of the 60,000 women who participated, half of them underwent annual screening with mammography and physical examination for a period of four consecutive years. The mortality rate of the women who had undergone screening was decreased by 30% seven years after the study began. The long term benefits of screening were also made apparent for participants who received annual screens and experienced a 24% reduction in breast cancer mortality after 14 years (Bassett, 1991;Gold et al., 1990). Soon afterwards in 1967, the first commercial model of the \"Senographe\" (French for picture of the breast) became available (GE Healthcare, 2006). It was the first \"dedicated\" mammography unit, or the first unit manufactured strictly for mammography (Gold et al., 1990). An improved model was introduced in the late seventies which resulted from the marriage of both patient and doctor generated ideas as well as advances in technology. Another worthy contributor to mammography was a surgeon named Edward A. Sickles, who revolutionized mammography screening by lowering the cost and creating efficient ways in which to be screened. He lowered mammography costs by streamlining radiologic and office operations to maximize patient throughput and reducing cost. (Sickles, Webber, & Galvin, 1986). Sickles also championed the idea of using mobile vans as sites for mammography screening situating them near large downtown office buildings or at supermarkets so that working and nonworking women could undergo screening rapidly and conveniently incorporate it into their day. Not only was screening improving in cost and ease, but also in standards guaranteeing its quality. In 1999, the Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) was passed. MQSA regulates the quality of mammography equipment. In order to legally operate in the U.S.; all operational systems must pass MQSA requirements, ensuring the quality of all systems on the market (GE Healthcare, 2006). Mammography has evolved from simple radiography of mastectomy specimens to the foremost method of breast cancer screening due to the endeavors of leaders in the field who researched, wrote and lectured about it constantly. Because of their efforts, many individuals after undergoing mammography screening are able to detect breast cancer at an early stage and fully recover."}, {"section_title": "Barriers to Mammography Screening", "text": "Mammograms are not something that many women routinely receive, for it is estimated that only 70% of women aged 40 and older have had a mammogram within the past two years (Breen, Wagener, Brown, Davis, & Ballard-Barbash, 2001). Mammography is underused by certain groups of women, in particular poor and minority women. These two groups are particularly at-risk due to barriers they face. However, some of the barriers that poor and minority women face are common barriers with which many women struggle. Studies have examined many of these barriers which include fear of pain, cost, transportation, perceived susceptibility, older age and, education level. These barriers overshadow the many positive benefits that mammography screening affords such as reducing breast cancer morbidity and mortality, by detecting cancer at an earlier stage, and the positive reassurance a negative mammogram provides. To identify those individuals who are at-risk for a poor screening profile, it is essential to study non-modifiable structural and demographic factors such as age, income, marital status, and ethnicity. Breast cancer incidence is increasing in white women age 50 years and older, stabilizing for African American women age 50 years and older and decreasing for African American women under age 50 years (Smigal et al., 2006). Women with lower levels of education, without health insurance and recent immigrants are less likely to receive mammograms than other populations. From 1992 through 2002 other racial and ethnic groups have experienced varying trends in mammography screening. Mammography rates have increased among Asian Americans/ Pacific Islanders (by 1.5% per year) and decreased among American Indians/Alaska Natives (by 3.5% per year) and have not changed significantly among Hispanics/Latinas (Smigal et al., 2006). It is important to acknowledge that trends vary by age, race, and socioeconomic status. In order to structure an intervention that will be successful and effective in convincing more women to seek mammography screening, it is important to identify these perceived barriers. One of the most common barriers to scheduling a mammogram is fear. However in some cases fear may act as a motivator for screening. The fear of the mammogram is associated with fear of the medical establishment, and of the potential pain associated with mammography. Fear of mammography may even be evoked by horror stories told by friends and family (Engleman, Cizik, & Ellerbeck, 2005). One suggestion for helping women cope with this type of fear comes from Engleman, Cizik & Ellerbeck (2005) who recommend that a television be included in the waiting room and that it should play an instructional video about the procedures involved with a mammography so patients would know what to expect. This would help alleviate the fear that a woman experiences waiting for the mammogram, particularly a woman who has never had one. Other fears women may have concerning mammography include the fear of radiation, the fear that the procedure may prove embarrassing, and the fear that the diagnosis of breast cancer (Consedine, Magai, Krivoshekova, Ryzewicz, & Neugut, 2004). The fear of receiving a diagnosis of breast cancer can be exacerbated by the time spent waiting for results. In order to minimize or alleviate this fear, new ways of obtaining mammography results quicker and with greater certainty must be devised. While fear may deter some women from getting mammograms, it can also motivate others to engage in regular screenings. Women who are more aware of their health problems and risks for disease are more likely to adhere to screening guidelines. For example, if cancer runs in an individual's family, the individual is more likely to have negative attitudes towards cancer and think their risk of getting cancer is greater (Hailey, Carter, & Burnett, 2000). Even though studies suggest that women with a family history of breast cancer are more likely to comply with breast screening guidelines compared to those without a family history, screening in this group is still underutilized (Anderson, Smith, Meishchke, Bowen, & Urban, 2003;Hailey et al., 2000;Rahman, Dignan, & Shelton, 2003;Spyckerelle, Kuntz, Giordanella, & Ancelle-Park, 2002). This may be because women with a relative or family member with cancer fear being diagnosed with cancer themselves and neglect to get screened. Differential access to mammography screening is an additional barrier that is essential to address. Women who live in rural areas may have a more advanced stage of disease when diagnosis finally occurs. The group most at risk for late stage diagnosis due to ineffective screening is older women age 70 years and up. Transportation issues, psychosocial barriers, low literacy levels and institutional barriers are all contributing factors to low screening rates. The mortality rate among women age 70 years and older is twice that for women of 55 years of age (Peek, 2003). Screening among the elderly is still controversial. Even though they are at higher risk for breast cancer than younger women, elderly women are also more likely to have competing mortality risks from cardiovascular disease and other illnesses. Many early studies, even after adjusting for comorbidity, age, race and quality of life, found that it was still more cost effective to screen all women with mammography (Eddy, 1987;Mandelbalatt et al., 1992). These studies contributed to the passage of the 1991 Congressional decision to fund biennial mammograms for women without setting an upper age limit (Peek, 2003). Another benefit to screening women age 70 years and older is that the sensitivity of mammography increases with age and ranges between 70% and 95% accuracy (Shen & Zelen, 2001). One way to assure adequate medical access to women age 70 years and older is using in-reach activities, which are defined as interventions held within the primary care setting, to increase screening mammography (Champion & Skinner, 2003). Some examples of in-reach activities include displaying posters, or playing videotapes in patient waiting rooms, having a reminder system for mammography appointments in place for patients and physicians, and using targeted incentives such as gas and food coupons to encourage screening. One other way to solve the issue of limited access of mammography screening among the elderly is to use patient navigators, who help patients make appointments, arrange transportation, locate facilities and even accompany patients to their mammogram screening. Another barrier to mammography use is encouraging physicians to make the recommendation to receive a mammogram. Due to the nature of the physician/client relationship, physicians have the ability to pass along vital health information and recommendations for future care including the recommendation for a mammogram. However, many women do not get such a recommendation from their physician. To determine the level of impact physician recommendations have had on mammography screening, past studies have examined what influences physician recommendations for mammography (Nutting et al., 2001). Factors which may affect the willingness of a patient to follow through with a physician recommendation include the physician's area of expertise (Chamot & Perneger, 2003), the physician's communication skills with their patients (Lane, Messina, & Grimson, 2001), the sex of the physician (Lurie et al., 1993), the use of physician recommendation in addition with reminder methods (Taplin, Anderman, Grothaus, Curry, & Montano, 1994), the patient's insurance type (Gorin et al., 2006), and the physicians' impact on underserved communities (Gorin et al., 2006). Having a physician make a recommendation is still better than not having a recommendation at all which can be common depending on the type of health insurance an individual possesses. Whether or not a patient has fee for service versus a managed care organization can have consequences on the type of preventative care an individual receives. A managed care organization (MCO) is defined as being the type of health care plan an individual purchases through a health maintenance organization (HMO), in which the plan requires that the individual receive care from specified HMO physicians or physicians referred by that HMO physician. There is also a stipulation that the policy holder designate a primary care doctor, group of doctors, or a specific clinic that the policyholder must go to for all routine, non-emergent care (Miller & Luft, 1994). In contrast, an individual is classified as being enrolled in a fee for service (FFS) plan if he or she is privately insured and does not meet the criteria for enrollment in a MCO plan (Monheit, Wilson, & Arnett, 1999). Regardless of racial or ethnic group, it was found that persons belonging to MCOs had access to more preventative services (which included physical examination, blood pressure measurement, cholesterol testing, Pap testing, clinical breast examination, mammography and prostate examination) than those in FFS (DeLaet, Shea, & Carrasquillo, 2002). Also, among Hispanics the difference between MCO and FFS enrollees and use of preventative services was greatest among those of the lowest income and education level. African Americans in MCOs received more preventative services than those in FFS (DeLaet et al., 2002). The delivery of preventative health services in MCOs can be attributed to the emphasis that MCOs place on preventative services. In fact, it was found that Hispanic women in FFS plan were less likely than non-Hispanic whites to report having Pap smears, mammograms and breast examinations. This is reflective of the fact that MCOs have undertaken initiatives to improve the care of patients from different ethnic backgrounds through culturally appropriate community outreach activities."}, {"section_title": "The Effect of Urban or Rural Residency on Mammography Use", "text": "A newer barrier that has been studied recently is the whether the location in which a woman lives affects her frequency of mammography screening. The location in which a woman lives can be tied to other barriers such as transportation. Traveling a long distance may produce an additional burden and mammography screening may be less accessible in certain geographical areas. In a study conducted by Engelmann et al. (2002) it was found that mammography screening rates were lower in counties that only had mobile facilities and that mammography screening rates were higher in counties that had permanent facilities. The distance one has to travel to go to a permanent mammography facility can also have an impact on the stage of the woman's cancer once it is detected. This trend was determined by a study conducted in Georgia where it was found that rural patients who had breast cancer were more likely to have an advanced form of the disease at diagnosis as compared to urban patients (Liff, Chow, & Greenberg, 1991). Rural areas may also be disadvantaged when it comes to mammography screening because of their smaller populations. A study by Marchick & Henderson (2005) found a strong association between population size and the total number of mammography facilities. Determining geographical disparities in health services, specifically mammography, can be an important tool for policymakers trying to decide where to focus limited resources and can be helpful when developing purposeful research regarding interventions. A study conducted by Leger et al. (2002) found that health behaviors may be related to particular locales. They hypothesized this may be due to the fact that hardto-reach populations \"may remain outside the focus of intervention research\" (Legler, Breen, Meissner, Malec, & Coyne, 2002). In fact they found that of the southeastern states, no intervention research targeting African Americans mammography use had occurred in Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, South Carolina, or Florida (Legler, Breen, Meissner, Malec, & Coyne, 2002). They concluded that states without studies were largely rural and had relatively little research infrastructure. Legler et al. also found that a common predictor of mammography screening use was education and income and that, \"Counties with large percentages of white-collar workers were associated with higher mammography use and counties with higher proportions of persons with less formal education (ninth grade or less) correspond to lower use\" (Legler et al., 2002, p.938). In conjunction with urban or rural residence, ethnicity has been found to have an impact on mammography screening use. Coughlin et al. (2001) found that women in metropolitan areas were more likely than women in rural areas to have had a recent mammogram and the association with either rural or nonrural residence was even stronger with African American and Hispanic women as compared to White women (Coughlin, Thompson, Hall, Logan, & Uhler, 2002). Urban residents may use preventative services more often because they may have a greater availability of medical services in urban areas. Another contributing factor could be that women living in rural areas have limited access to health care practitioners and to fewer preventative health care services (Coughlin et al., 2002)."}, {"section_title": "Georgia and North Carolina's current mammography programs", "text": "In 1990, to improve women's access to screening for breast and cervical cancers, Since 1991, more than 2.7 million women have been served by NBCCEDP, which provided more than 6.5 million screening examinations, and diagnosed more than 26,000 women as having breast cancer. NBCCEDP was responsible for screening 391,968 women for breast cancer using mammography in 2004 (Centers for Disease Control andPrevention, 2006/2007 A study conducted by Tangka et al. (2006) examined the NBCCEDP to determine whether it served the screening needs of underserved women. They found that in [2002][2003], of all U.S. women aged 40-64 years (who are eligible for free mammography through the program), four million (8.5%) had no health insurance and a family income below 250% of the federal poverty level and of those women, only 528, 622 (13.2%) received a Program funded mammogram. The ethnic group that constituted the largest number of women eligible for the Program was white women, of which there were two million in total. The ethnic groups who had the greatest number of women screened were American Indians and Alaska Natives. States varied in percentages of eligible women screened from 2% to 79% and the amount of women eligible were greater in heavily populated states such as California, Texas, New York, and Florida than in other states. The state with the greatest number of eligible women for the NBCCEDP Program was New Mexico. In Georgia, only 6.8% of 95,000 eligible women got screened. The poverty criterion for Georgia was 200%, or earning an income for a family of four equaling $37,000 per year. In North Carolina only 10.3% of 137,000 eligible women got screened, the poverty criterion was also 200% (Tangka et al., 2006). To help alleviate the barriers to quality health care that medically underserved individuals face, the bill provides grants to help set up navigator programs, which in turn help improve access to prevention screenings and other services. The navigator systems will also encourage increased screening participation of women who lack a consistent source of care, and help alleviate the difficulty of navigating the health care system, so that more women will participate in breast and cervical cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment. A program specific to North Carolina was the FoCaS Project, a breast and cervical cancer screening intervention, which took place over four years as a demonstration project designed to test interventions to increase rates of screening in lowincome women. It was conducted in two North Carolina counties, Forsyth and Guildford, one of which served as a control group among residents of low-income housing communities. The intervention city encouraged screening by chart reminders, exam room prompts, as well as staff and patient education. The community outreach component included educational sessions and literature distribution at community events and church activities. As a result of the intervention, the proportion of women who received mammography within the last two years increased from 31% to 56% (American Cancer Society, 2004). There remains a need for services among low income underserved populations. In 2003, there were more than 2.3 million uninsured, low income women aged 40-64 years who did not receive recommended mammograms from either the Program or other sources. It is important to figure out how to increase efficiencies of the NBCCEDP Programs and how to serve more women with existing resources. A study found that the average cost of screening a woman through the Program was lower for greater numbers of women because as average cost decreased, the number of women screened increased (Mansley, Dunet, May, Chattopadhyay, & McKenna, 2002). One suggestion to increase the number of eligible women screened through NBCCEDP Programs includes improving collaboration and coordination with other providers that serve a similar client population (Tangka et al., 2006). Besides examining the numbers of women getting screened, an additional key component to examine is whether or not mammography facilities and trained specialists are available in the specific county."}, {"section_title": "Assessment of Availability of Mammography Services", "text": "Additional barriers that have been a focus in the failure of women to obtain a mammogram include the closure of mammography facilities and service curtailments, which contribute to making it more difficult for women to schedule and to obtain the procedure, within a reasonable amount of time. The primary concern is that women are not receiving mammograms due to limitations in access. The Food and Drug Administrations (FDA's) database of mammography facilities show 9,512 certified domestic operations as of June 2001. In other years, there were 9,558 certified facilities (46 more) in January of 2000 and 9,314 facilities (198 fewer) on January 1, 1999. In comparison to 1994, there were 10,119 facilities were open and 9,956 in 1997. It was observed that access problems may have resulted from the loss of facilities, particularly for women who were medically underserved such as those who have a low income, or lack health insurance. Contributing to the access problems were the lengthy weight times and the increased distances individuals had to travel when a facility in their county closed. Those women who were medically underserved inherited a significant burden by having to take extra time away from work or family responsibilities. In addition, these women were of particular concern because those who lack health insurance or have low incomes are the same women with lower than average screening mammography rates. Interestingly, a study conducted in 2002 by GAO found that most availability problems occurred in certain metropolitan areas like Houston and Los Angeles, but the greatest loss in capacity occurred in rural counties of Baltimore including the counties of Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Baltimore City, and Prince George's. The loss of mammography machines was calculated as a 25% decrease and 121 counties, most of them rural, were most affected (Government Accountability Office, 2002). Another surprising find by the same study was that during their follow up at 55 rural and metropolitan counties where reductions occurred in facilities or machines, lengthy appointment waiting times were primarily found in metropolitan locations. The study found that the counties that lost services were able to draw on increased resources in a neighboring county with the result being that the longest waiting time was one month or less, which was considered to be reasonable. The travel distance a woman had to travel from one county with decreased resources to a neighboring one was less than 40 miles, which officials considered common in rural areas. Another option rural county's had for women was offering mobile mammogram facilities that traveled to their area. The study conducted by GAO (2006) did find that the number of mammograms performed by U.S. machines was substantially lower than the maximal numbers that could be performed. They estimated that one machine and one radiologic technologist could perform three mammograms per hour or 24 mammograms in an eight hour day. Therefore, there was a potential maximal capacity of 6,000 mammograms per machine per year and that there is unused capacity nationwide. Of most concern was the dwindling numbers of radiologists and radiologic technologists entering the field every year which may not be adequate to serve the increasing population of women 40 and older. This may lead to future access problems. Findings from a 2004 survey of community-based mammography facilities in three states indicated that 44% of facilities reported experiencing a shortage of radiologists and 46% reporting had some level of difficulty in maintaining adequate numbers of qualified technologists (D'Orsi & et al, 2005). Since the main access issues that exist in certain geographical areas pertain to long wait times and traveling great distances to get mammography screenings, most experts in the study conducted by GAO (2006) (Black, Alvarado-Cowens, Gershman, & Weir, 2005). Currently there are 49 states that have cancer plans as well as four tribes and eight territories (American Cancer Society, 2007). One of the reasons CCC was started was to help states overcome barriers to reduce the burden of cancer incidence and mortality. One such barrier is that of categorical funding (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2004;Lorentz, 2005). It is the tendency in the United States to direct money to programs for specific forms of cancer, like lung or colorectal, or to risk-factor programs like smoking or sun exposure. Through CCC, states and private organizations, as well as non-profit partners, collaborate on an ongoing basis to maximize the impact of limited resources and in turn do a better job of preventing cancer and saving lives. Other barriers that states encounter when developing and implementing state plans are; ineffective use of data (Black et al., 2005), lack of community ownership, programmatic change (Kerner et al., 2005), sustainability, limited resources, competition (True, Kean, Nolan, Haviland, & Hohman, 2005), lack of coordination, disparities in knowledge, and insufficient information due to a lack of evaluation (Given, Bruce, Lowry, Huang, & Kerner, 2005). The state cancer plans are specific to the health needs of the particular state, but generally have a section on each of the following cancers; breast, cervical, colorectal, prostate, skin, and testicular. They examine particular health behaviors and living and working conditions which may put an individual more at increased risk for particular cancers. This study examined the eight states in HHS Region IV (United States Department of Health and Human Services, 2004). These states include Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. The Comprehensive Cancer Control Plans of these eight states were examined to determine if the plans listed whether living in a rural county can be a risk factor for neglecting to get a mammography screening."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER III METHODS AND PROCEDURES", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "IRB and Data Management", "text": "The protocol for this study was reviewed and approved by the Georgia State University Institutional Review Board (IRB) on March 23, 2007 under the exempt review process. Data that are used for this research came from the Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).

The data is published with the removal of personal identifiers in electronic format and is publicly accessible via the CDC website. There was no sensitive context data used in the original data collection."}, {"section_title": "Research Design", "text": "This study was designed to: (1) determine whether there is a statistically significant difference in urban or rural mammography screening rates, (2) assess the availability of mammography screening facilities and 3 Bias is removed from the sample by using standard weighting which affects both the point estimate (bias) and confidence intervals (precision). The CDC developed a standard core questionnaire that allows comparison data across states. Georgia and North Carolina were chosen for this study based on proximity and comparability in size and population. The BRFSS mammography screening data for the years 2002 and 2004 is available for both states. Each state employs a BRFSS state coordinator, who provided the raw state level data for Georgia and North Carolina for this study. The North Carolina BRFSS state coordinator provided the data for years 2002 and 2004 on a CD-ROM. The Georgia BRFSS state coordinator sent the data for Georgia's 2002 and 2004 BRFSS via e-mail. The 2002 and 2004 data for Georgia and North Carolina were checked for accuracy and matching variables. The data then were merged together for ease of analysis. The mammography screening rates for women who lived in urban counties by state were calculated and recorded, and the same was done for rural counties by state. To determine the availability of mammography screening facilities in Georgia and North Carolina, data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) was utilized to obtain the address of the facilities. The FDA 2005 data was used because that is the most recent year the U.S. Census population estimates were available at the county level. In addition, FDA 2005 data was used to best measure availability of mammography facilities at the time of the BRFSS survey. Zip code information was used to determine the county location of each certified mammography facility. As described previously, each county in Georgia and North Carolina was designated as either urban or rural utilizing the USDA Rural/Urban Continuum Codes. Each facility's name, address, city, state, zip code, county and its urban or rural designation was entered into an excel spreadsheet. At the study author's request, the Georgia Division of Public Health and the North Carolina Division of Public Health utilized the facility spreadsheet to map the Georgia and North Carolina mammography facilities. Using the data provided by the FDA, the number of urban and rural facilities for each state was calculated. The FDA 2007 data also was used to measure whether there had been a change in availability of mammography facilities and was mapped using the same process as the 2005 data. The State Comprehensive Cancer Plans for the eight states in Health and Human Services (HHS) Region IV (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee) were reviewed to determine if the plans address differential screening rates among women who live in rural counties. A search of the documents for the terms \"urban, rural, metropolitan, non-metropolitan, county and residence\" was made and the frequency of the terms used in the plans and how they were used were recorded into tables."}, {"section_title": "Research Variables", "text": "Variables for the specific state STATE (1=Georgia, 2=North Carolina) were created and variables for the data year YEAR (1=2002, 2=2004) were created to ensure that data could be analyzed individually by state and year. The variable for either urban or rural county was created by looking up the state Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) codes (Georgia=13, North Carolina=37), county FIPS codes by state (see Appendices A, B). Each county in each state is given a three digit FIPS code. Urban or rural classification was determined using Rural-Urban Continuum Codes compiled by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 2003. A \"rural\" county was defined as a county located in a \"non metropolitan\" area and an \"urban\" county was defined as a county located in a \"metropolitan\" area. The variable for urban or rural county classification was CTYCODE (county code) recoded as (1=urban, 2=rural). There was also a variable for SEX (1=male, 2=female) which was filtered for females only to be used in data analysis. Other variables included: number of women in the household NUMWOMEN (1=0, 2=1, 3=2 or more);, whether the participant had health coverage HLTPLAN (1=yes, 2=no); if the participant had a personal physician PERSDOC (1=yes, 2=no); the age of the participant AGE (1=18-39, 2=40-59, 3=60+); level of education EDUCA (1=less than high school, 2=high school, 3=more than high school); employment status EMPLOY (1=employed, 2=unemployed); income level INCOME2 (1=above the poverty level, 2=below the poverty level); if the participant ever had a mammogram HADMAM (1=yes, 2=no); how long since the participant's last mammogram HOWLONG (1=within the past year, 2=within the past 2-3 years, 3=five years or more); and the participants race RACE2 (1=white, 2=African American, 3=other, 4=Hispanic). Ages 40 years and above were the only examined age groups covered by screening standards, so ages 18-39 were excluded in the analysis. The BRFSS questions that were used in this study included: 5. Are you currently\u2026? Employed for wages, self-employed, out of work for more than 1 year, out of work for less than 1 year, a homemaker, a student, retired, or unable to work? 6. Is your annual income from all sources-less than $10,000, less than $15,000, less than $20,000, less than $25,000, less than $35,000, less than $50,000, less than $75,000, $75,000 or more? 7. A mammogram is an x-ray of the breast to look for breast cancer. Have you ever had a mammogram? 8. How long has it been since your last mammogram? 9. Which one of these groups would you say best represents your race? White, black or African American, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, American Indian, Alaskan Native, Other, do not know/not sure, multiracial?"}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "Statistical programs that are available in SPSS\u00ae 15.0 were used in this study. Initially, descriptive statistics were calculated to establish prevalence of independent health variables (i.e., income level, education level, employment, having had a mammogram, etc.) in urban or rural counties. Subsequently, statistical significance was established by using chi-square tests and calculating 95% confidence intervals and P values. The chi-square tests examined the relationship between the dependent variable (mammography screening) and the independent variables (income, employment, education, number of females in the household, etc.). The larger the chi-square, the less likely it is that difference is due to chance. A P value less than five percent means that the probability is not due to chance. The data retrieved from 2002 and 2004 were compared using logistic regression analysis. \"Logistic regression allows you to test models and predict categorical outcomes with two or more variables\" (Pallant, 2005). Binary regression was conducted initially with the dependent variable being the question, \"Have you had a mammogram?\" after controlling for the state, year and county code (urban or rural). The last statistical test performed was the multivariate logistic analysis. This statistical test was conducted to determine if all confounding variables were equally accounted for, which independent variables had a significant association with mammography.     Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated to determine the magnitude and direction of the associations of the independent variables and mammography screening. \"An odds ratio of 1 indicates that the condition or event under study is equally likely in both groups. An odds ratio greater than 1 indicates that the   condition or event is more likely in the first group. And an odds ratio less than 1 indicates that the condition or event is less likely in the first group. The odds ratio must be greater than or equal to zero\" (Le, 2001). Odds ratios were calculated to determine if mammography screening was more prevalent with common characteristics such as income, educational attainment employment and then if these characteristics were found more significantly in women who live in urban or rural counties and is used as a means of expressing the results abbreviated as \"OR.\" In order to accurately capture any differences that may exist within the states, data was analyzed using univariate logistic regression taking into account the county code (urban or rural) in which the woman surveyed lived, the state (Georgia or North Carolina) and the year (2002 or 2004). As shown in Tables 6 and 7           Although a predominate pattern of mammography usage in the urban and rural counties of Georgia and North Carolina could not be established, Table 16 shows the finding that did remain constant was that women who had a usual source of care and health insurance were more likely to get screened than those who were less educated.    Figure 5). Six of the 88 rural counties had more than one facility located in them; in the urban counties, 15 of the 71 contained one or more facilities. The reduced number of facilities in the rural counties could create accessibility issues for women living in those counties. There were 96 facilities in North Carolina in 2005, of which 61 were located in urban counties and 32 were located in rural counties (as shown in Figure 6). Eleven of the 41 urban counties contained more than one facility; only seven of the 59 rural counties contained more than one facility. In North Carolina the numbers of mammography facilities in both the urban and rural counties were found to be inadequate when compared to the GAO standard. There were 2,015,349 women 18 years of age and older who lived in the urban counties of North Carolina in 2005. To meet the GAO standard, there should have been 202 facilities in the urban counties, but there were only 61 facilities. Women who lived in urban counties had access to 141 fewer mammography facilities than the GAO standard. There were a total of 399,419 women living in the rural counties of North Carolina in 2005. The GAO standard called for 40 facilities; in actuality there were 32, resulting in a shortage of eight facilities. The number of mammography facilities available in urban counties in Georgia was inadequate when compared to the mammography screening facilities which should be available per the GAO standard. In North Carolina, the number of mammography facilities in both the urban and rural counties was found to be inadequate when compared to the GAO standard.   To assess whether there has been any change in the number of mammography facilities in the two states, the study author, with the aid of the public health departments    The CCCSPs of the eight states in HHS Region IV were examined to see if they defined the term \"rural\" in their state plans and if so, if they defined the term in the same way. Of the eight plans, only one plan (North Carolina) explicitly defined rural as a \"non-metropolian area.\" The other seven plans lacked a glossary or neglected to provide an explicit definition of \"rural.\" For all plans a term search was conducted for the word \"rural \" to determine its use and the frequency within each plan. Each state cancer plan was examined to determine whether these plans acknowledged a disparity of services amongst rural areas. The plans were searched for the following terms: urban, rural, metropolitan, non-metropolitan, county and residence. After noting the frequency of the terms mentioned within each plan, the plan was reviewed to determine how the terms were used in the plan with respect to goals or programs being developed in the state. As shown in Figure 9 above, five of the state cancer plans observed living in a rural area as a risk factor for not getting a mammogram; three states did not. This finding partially confirms a study by Leger et al. (2002) who found that of the Southeastern states, no intervention research targeting blacks on mammography use had occurred in Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, South Carolina, or Florida (Legler et al., 2002). They concluded that states without studies were largely rural and had relatively little research infrastructure. However, the difference in the findings of Legler et al. and the study's findings reported herein may be due to the fact that their study was conducted in 2002. Since that time, more attention has been paid to closing the gap in racial disparities pertaining to mammography screening and more research has since been conducted in Southeastern states. All of the plans (with the exception of Tennessee) recognized the barrier of transportation which prevents women from getting mammograms (Appendix C, p. 104) "}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER V DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION", "text": "As discussed in Chapters I and II, appropriate and timely utilization of mammography screening and breast cancer symptoms lead to early detection of breast cancer. However, universal adherence to routine screening still is a distant goal. This study attempted to determine whether rural residents of two Southeastern states had lower mammography screening rates than their urban counterparts. This study found no significant difference between mammography screening rates of women in the rural counties of Georgia and North Carolina and those living in urban counties of these states. This study had the following findings: there is not a significant difference in mammography screening rates among women who live in rural counties in Georgia and North Carolina for years 2002 and 2004 when compared to women living in urban counties for those years; utilizing FDA 2005 data to assess the compliance with GAO's recommended standard on availability of mammography, it was found that the number of facilities in the rural counties of Georgia was adequate, but was not in the urban counties of either state; and five of the eight HHS Region IV states note rural residence as a risk factor for neglecting to get screened. Though both states increased access for women of screening age by 2007 deficiencies still exist. Although no significant pattern was established for mammography screening and living in either an urban or rural county, some important findings from this study did emerge. The most important finding from the univariate logistic regression is that women of screening age (40-59 years) had reduced odds of getting screened in both Georgia and North Carolina for both 2002 and 2004 whether they lived in urban and rural counties. This suggests that current programs targeting women of screening age may be ineffective. After conducting the multivariate logistic regression analysis which adjusted for confounding factors, it was determined that having a personal doctor was significantly associated with women of 40-59 years of age getting screened. This result applied to women who lived in urban counties in both Georgia and North Carolina in 2004. This result confirms the Legler et al. findings in which urban residents used preventative services more often than rural residents because there is a greater availability of medical services in urban areas. Women who live in rural areas have limited access to health care practitioners and preventative health care services (Legler et al., 2002). Women who were employed and had access to preventative medical services in rural counties of Georgia in 2002 and urban counties of North Carolina in 2004 were positively predicted to have a mammogram. Among women 60 years of age and older who lived in either urban or in rural counties of Georgia or North Carolina in 2004, the best indicators for getting screened were having health coverage and a personal doctor. The critical role of a physician's recommendation for mammography screening has been validated repeatedly (O'Malley et al., 2001;Taplin, Anderman, Grothaus, Curry, & Montano, 1994) along with the priority of developing and testing strategies to improve physician recommendation of mammography (Chamot & Perneger, 2003;Nutting et al., 2001). The important role that education plays in getting screened was prominent among women 60 years of age and older living in either urban or rural counties of Georgia in 2002 and in North Carolina among women 60 years of age or older who lived in either urban or rural counties in 2004. Women having only a high school education were negatively predicted to get a mammogram. Though no significant findings between race and mammography screening rates were found, it should be noted that the largest ethnic group to take the Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System survey (BRFSS) for the years 2002 and 2004 in both Georgia and North Carolina were white women. This demographic is similar to Tangka et. al's (2006) study in which white women in Georgia with health care coverage and a personal doctor were most likely to get screened. This implies that the screening rates reported herein may not be accurate for African American and other ethnic populations. The finding that the number of mammography facilities in both Georgia and North Carolina has increased from 2005 to 2007 may not be sufficient to assess the accessibility of the facilities. Mere counts of facilities in urban and rural counties is at best a gross measure of accessibility since having access to mammography may depend on factors that are independent of facility location and which were impossible to measure in this study. As discussed in the literature review, common barriers to screening include access to transportation, hours of operation of the facility, availability of translation services, and whether a facility accepts individuals unable to pay. A limitation of the FDA data on mammography facilities is that they do not identify mobile facilities, which may serve a multi-county area. It also should be noted that despite the increase in numbers of mammography facilities there is still a large number of counties in both Georgia and North Carolina without a facility. According to the FDA 2007 data, 58 of the 159 Georgia counties have no facility and 16 of the 100 North Carolina counties lack a facility. Another unexpected finding of this study was that the number of mammography facilities per 10,000 women in urban counties in both Georgia and North Carolina for 2005 and 2007 were insufficient according to the GAO standard. This may be cause for examining adequacy of facility accessibility in the comprehensive cancer control state plans of Georgia and North"}, {"section_title": "Carolina.", "text": "As noted previously, five of the eight HHS Region IV states addressed living in a rural area as a risk factor for not getting screened. This suggests that these states may be taking affirmative action to ensure that women of screening age in rural counties utilize mammography on a timely basis. More examination of the actions of these states may provide explanation for their success in ensuring that no urban/rural disparity in screening rates exist in their respective states."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "Due to the cross-sectional structure of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey, an association between an urban or rural county residence and mammography screening rates cannot be established. Because the survey was administered via telephone (excluding individuals who do not own a telephone or use cell phones only) and is based on a small sample size, not all of the eligible individuals in the counties of Georgia and North Carolina were represented. These survey participation problems may be an explanation for failing to find a significant difference between screening rates among urban and rural women. Not all survey respondents listed a Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code. On the 2002 Georgia BRFSS, 93 respondents did not report their county of residence, in 2004 there were 86 respondents with no reported county of residence. This problem also was found in North Carolina BRFSS data; in 2002, 85 respondents did not report their county of residence, and in 2004, 144 respondents neglected to indicate the county in which they lived. As a result, these individuals were excluded from the analysis. The impact of these exclusions is not known. The significance of the barriers to getting mammography screening among women who live in either urban or rural counties could not be tested because the question concerning the barriers to health care was worded differently on the BRFSS surveys for 2002 compared to 2004. In 2002, the section addressing Health Care Access included a question coded as MEDREAS which asked, \"What was the main reason you did not get medical care?\". The responses were placed into the following categories: cost, distance, office was not open when I could get there; too long a wait for an appointment, no child care, no transportation, no access for people with disabilities, and medical provider did not speak my language. In 2004, the section addressing Health Care Access no longer asked about the medical reason for not getting care and only asked about the barrier of cost. The question's wording was changed to the following, \"Was there a time in the past twelve months when you needed to see a doctor but could not because of cost?\". The responses received fell into the following categories: yes, no, do not know/not sure. Because only the barrier of cost was examined on the 2004 survey, the study author was unable to use significance tests to measure the strength of association of the barrier of cost as well as the other barriers which prevent a woman from getting a mammogram. Knowing the reason(s) a woman did not get a mammogram would have made it possible to determine which barriers have the greatest impact. If the 2004 BRFSS had contained the original question on why a woman did not get a mammogram, barriers such as wait times, language, and transportation issues could have been tracked over time to see if programs aimed at removing barriers were successful. Since BRFSS chose to focus only on cost in 2004 no other barrier that can be studied in a longitudinal manner. Another change in the Health Care Access Section between 2002 and 2004 surveys was on the 2004 BRFSS survey, which had no question asking where the individual normally received their medical care. The answers to the question in 2002 fell in the following categories: a doctor's office, public health clinic or community center, a hospital outpatient department, a hospital emergency room, urgent care center, some other kind of place, do not know/not sure, no usual place. On the 2004 BRFSS survey this information was not collected, which prevented the study author from identifying where a woman received her medical care and if issues of access were prominently associated with a specific type of health provider. Because the 2002 BRFSS questions on Health Care Access were changed or eliminated, data from those questions could not be used. If these questions had not been removed or altered, it would have been possible to identify which barrier had the greatest influence on getting a mammogram and possibly explain why women in rural counties were or were not getting a mammogram. Women who live in rural counties must struggle with issues of geographical access and overcome the barriers associated with transportation, distance, lack of special health care providers, and specialized equipment to obtain a mammogram. For future program development these barriers should be targeted. The variable of income is another limitation to this study because of the small sample size and the large strata of income categories. For the purpose of this study, individuals were classified as having incomes below the poverty level or above the poverty level. Income level may have had an impact on the ability of a woman to access preventative services and health care coverage, but this could not be tested because the sample size was too small to analyze the effect of different levels of income on mammography screening rates in detail. The calculation of mammography facilities per 10,000 women used for this study was based on population data used from the American Community Survey for women 18 to 65 years of age. Because this study focused on women of screening age, women 65 years of age and older were excluded from the population used to calculate mammography facility availability rates. The state cancer plans for HHS Region IV did not use a consistent definition of the terms rural, urban, metropolitan, and non-metropolitan. In fact, only one of the eight plans (North Carolina) explicitly defined a rural area as a \"non metropolitan\" area. All of the other plans lacked a definition for rural and did not clarify how the term was used in their plan. Another obvious limitation of the plan review was that the plans may not accurately represent the actions of a state in respect to cancer prevention programs."}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Future Research", "text": "The findings of this study suggest multiple opportunities for future research on mammography screening. It is unknown if having a mammogram is contingent upon whether an individual lives in an urban or rural county because of the cross-sectional design of the BRFSS and other limitations of data used. Examining such factors as income level, employment, education, health insurance coverage, ethnicity, access to transportation, and age in a longitudinal manner may strengthen the known association between increased mammography screening rates and an individual's residence and provide insight for more effective screening program interventions. In order to increase the number of women age 40-59 years who get mammogram screenings, it is important to study and subsequently help remove barriers to access. It is the author's recommendation that the BRFSS reinstate the removed questions about where individuals typically go for medical care (FACILIT3), and what is preventing them from seeking care (MEDREAS) so that successful interventions and programs can be developed in order to effectively remove those barriers and target those women who are not getting screened. To better assess the accessibility of mammography facilities, a survey should be developed by the American Cancer Society, the FDA or state licensure entities to determine the times a mammography facility stays open, if they provide translation services, if they have telemedicine capability, how many mobile units they have, and how many individuals they serve from neighboring counties without a mammography facility, and whether the facility places a limitation on providing service to individuals who do no have health insurance coverage. All state cancer plans should have sections which define the terms used in the plan to insure a consistent definition of rural and urban and which have a section that addresses geographical access. so that plans better able to be compared. A state that has a plan addressing rural residence as a risk factor for not getting screened and one that does not should be compared to find out if there are significant differences among women getting screened who live in urban or rural counties."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This study found no significant differences in mammography screening rates between the screening age women who live in rural counties in Georgia or North Carolina versus the screening age women who live in the urban counties of these states. The univariate logistic regression analysis found that women of screening age 40-59 years were at reduced odds for getting screened irrespective of residence. The state cancer plans of both Georgia and North Carolina identified rural residence as a risk factor for not getting screened. These states may have taken actions to target those populations who live in rural counties. Further examination of the actions of the states may provide insight on why no significant difference was found. Consistent with the findings of previous studies, it was found that women of screening age with a personal physician had higher rates of mammography use, so programs encouraging physicians to recommend mammograms to their patients should continue to be encouraged and funded. Providing access to a personal physician is critical for improving screening rates. Among women 60 years of age and older, it was found that having a personal doctor and health care coverage was integral to getting screened regardless of urban or rural residence in both states. Having health care coverage gives individuals access to preventative health care services such as mammograms, which can be life saving. Public policy makers need to develop a program which provides access to personal doctors and preventative services to all individuals at risk. Mammography screening rates among all states should be examined using not only the BRFSS data, but also the National Health Interview Survey to determine whether significant differences exist among women who live in either urban or rural counties. With a larger body of data, studies can be refined, findings can be confirmed and the larger issue (if it is a shortage of mammography facilities among women in urban areas) can be identified and more easily resolved. More importantly, data needs to be made publicly accessible so the issue of mammography screening rates among women living in either urban or rural counties can be more closely examined and compared. State cancer plans should be standardized and include a glossary of terms used. For the sake of consistency, the CDC should require use of a standardized definition of key terms so that all terms studied within the plans can then be compared with certainty. The implementation of the cancer plans also should be examined by the CDC and if states are not implementing their state plans, the amount of funding a state receives for their comprehensive cancer control plans should be re-evaluated. Mammography screening is an extremely important procedure for early detection of breast cancer. This study was unable to establish residence in either urban or rural areas as a significant factor, but the study highlighted the inadequacy of key data to accurately measure pivotal factors which may lead to appropriate utilization of mammography and underscores the need for further research into methods of extending 2) The 2003 rural-urban continuum codes classify metropolitan counties (codes 1 through 3) by size of the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), and nonmetropolitan counties (codes 4 through 9) by degree of urbanization and proximity to metro areas. 2) The 2003 rural-urban continuum codes classify metropolitan counties (codes 1 through 3) by size of the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), and nonmetropolitan counties (codes 4 through 9) by degree of urbanization and proximity to metro areas. implementation and evaluation of programs to address a state's specific cancer problems. Because each state is unique in its size, geographic, and demographic make-up, no two plans are the same or have the same structure. Generally they do have a section on each of the following cancers; breast, cervical, colorectal, prostate, skin, and testicular. These  was to link urban and rural residents to cancer information through internet technologies. Another way of bridging the lack of knowledge of preventative cancer strategies among specific individuals was by developing partnerships between local physicians and urban health providers. That way, the rural residents who may be underserved, as well as special needs patients, could gain access to specialists. The plan also mentioned the Cooperative Extension Service (CES), which was a public education provider located in Kentucky's 120 counties helping to reach rural, underserved families on health-related issues. Geographical access was of particular concern to the Kentucky Cancer plan, to such a degree that there is a section in the plan devoted to addressing it. According to 1990 Census Bureau estimates, 48% of Kentucky's residents live in rural areas and specifically a priority of the plan stated, \"reduce the inequity in cancer burden among rural populations\" and more specifically to \"increase access to cancer screening and treatment in geographically underserved areas.\" Rural residents were of greatest concern for \"in seeking cancer care, they face a lack of specialized local care, cost and travel requirements.\" Adding to the difficulties that rural residents face was the fact that rural physicians and nurses have limited resources in providing or coordinating the quality of care that may be needed. Furthermore, no one individual or entity is responsible for overseeing overall cancer care. To help ease the difficulty of providing extensive health resources and facilities to rural residents, Kentucky's plan advocated for the use of telemedicine which is \"the application of modern telecommunications to the practice of medicine.\". Some services and opportunities that telemedicine provides are: administrative video conferences between a central headquarters and remote branches, networking continuing medical education (CME) offerings which include instruction in sophisticated medical procedures, video consultations permitting examination, diagnosis and treatment of a patient remotely, teleradiology, telepathology, patient medical records access and medical data banks. Kentucky had a telemedicine program called Kentucky Telecare which was started in 1993 by the University of Kentucky Chandler Medical Center and used twoway interactive video to bring rural health care providers and patients together with medical specialists at secondary and tertiary care centers. An alternative to telemedicine was to arrange for treatment specialists to establish office hours in remote rural areas. Another option would be to increase free or low-cost transportation and housing options for persons in remote areas who need to travel elsewhere for screening and treatment North Carolina had an extensive cancer plan which thoroughly covered rural residence and how it can be a risk factor for neglecting to get mammography screening. One study found that among those patients that neglected to get preventative medical care, \"factors associated with inadequate follow-up include rural residence and low income.\" Another study found that, \"women who seem to be most likely to underutilize services are low income, older, from rural or non-metropolitan areas.\" Rural residency is also pointed out in the plan as having played a role in late stage cancer diagnosis. This was partly due to the lack of state-of-the-art equipment for diagnosis, which again was rarely found in rural areas and was more prevalent in urban areas. The plan also highlighted a major barrier to receiving mammograms, which is that the specialized health care providers who were trained to perform diagnostic procedures were generally located in urban areas. The common barrier of transportation was a factor when a specialist was not available in a rural area so North Carolina's plan aimed to establish networks or linkages between rural providers and urban cancer centers so that optimal care was more accessible to rural cancer patients. In fact, an Eastern Regional Cancer Coalition had been formed to build networks or linkages among rural providers and urban cancer centers. The plan also recommended that health care practitioners in rural and underserved areas needed to be kept informed of current cancer therapies and resources, including the information on where and how to obtain these resources for their patients. Continuing medical education (CME) was also discussed in the cancer plan and how there was a difference in CME interest and demand in practice location, physicians preferring urban to rural counties. Interestingly, family physicians were found to have a statistically higher interest in screening, treatment, and follow-up care than other specialists. The preferred method for receiving a CME lecture was by in person lecture (63%) rather than a video conference format (6%). One recommendation to help make rural residents aware of their preventative health services was the distribution of cancer information to patients, providers, and the public with the emphasis on rural residents. The information included the availability of transportation services. Improving continuing education on cancer-related topics was another objective for targeting practitioners in underserved and rural areas.
