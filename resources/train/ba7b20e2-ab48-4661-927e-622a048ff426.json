Pulse pressure (PP) reflects arterial stiffness which may better reflect chronicity of hypertension. Methods: Over six annual cycles, 1954 individuals aged 651 years from a prospective populationbased cohort underwent BP measurements and cognitive evaluations. We examined the relationship of change in five cognitive domains to longitudinal PP patterns across the late-life age spectrum, before and after stratifying by baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) and adjusting for attrition. Results: There were four longitudinal PP patterns: stable normal, stable high, increasing, and decreasing. Those with lower baseline SBP and an increasing or stable high PP had less decline in cognition, an effect that was attenuated with aging. Among those with higher baseline SBP, there were no differences across PP groups, but increasing age was consistently associated with greater cognitive decline. Discussion: The effect of PP on cognitive decline depends on age, baseline SBP, and the trajectory of PP change. Cardiovascular mechanisms underlying cognitive aging should be recognized as nuanced and dynamic processes when exploring prevention and treatment targets in the elderly, so that the optimal timing and type of intervention can be identified."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Despite strong evidence for a positive association between midlife hypertension and late-life cognitive impairment [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] , the relationship between late-life hypertension and cognitive function remains unclear [1, 4, [6] [7] [8] .\nObserved inconsistencies between studies partly reflect variations in study design and populations. Another likely factor is unmeasured heterogeneity, within populations, as regard the timing and duration of exposure to hypertension, which in turn could influence its effects and potential modifiability [9] . Such investigations would benefit from a proxy measure representing the duration of exposure to hypertension.\nA potential proxy or surrogate measure is pulse pressure (PP), partly reflecting arterial stiffness, measured as the difference between systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). PP is potentially a better measure of the chronic effects of hypertension than blood pressure itself [1, [10] [11] [12] [13] . PP increases with age and is associated with a number of cardiovascular risk factors and outcomes [14, 15] . Arterial stiffness appears related to Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology, providing a potential vascular marker that is more closely related to AD [13, [16] [17] [18] than other cardiovascular measures. However, evidence remains conflicted as to the association of cognitive performance with arterial stiffness, whether measured as PP or through ultrasound determined pulse wave velocity [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] .\nHere, we explored the relationships between longitudinal change in PP and cognitive performance in multiple cognitive domains over 5 years and how these relationships were influenced by initial (baseline) blood pressure (BP). We identified subgroups of individuals with distinct PP trajectories over time and compared their relationships with change in cognition over the same period. As an increase in PP typically reflects significant vascular remodeling and stiffening, we hypothesized that those with increasing PP over time would have a greater decline in cognition. Further, because the impact of arterial health on brain health likely varies across the age spectrum of late life, we assessed whether the relationship between change in PP and cognition differed in the young-old and old-old. Finally, we accounted for the potential effects of participant loss over time, which is inevitable and likely nonrandom in longitudinal studies."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "The Monongahela-Youghiogheny Healthy Aging Team is an epidemiologic study of cognitive decline and dementia in an age-stratified, random sample drawn from the voter registration list of small town communities in Southwestern Pennsylvania [25] .

However, among those with baseline SBP above 132, there were at best marginal associations between PP and slope of cognitive decline (visuospatial function); but as a group, older age was associated with more decline than in the lower SBP group. Not unexpectedly, regardless of baseline SBP, age significantly increased the rate of decline across domains.

However, when evaluating distinct longitudinal profiles of PP change over the same time period and accounting for attrition, we identified differences in cognitive change that (1) varied by trajectory of PP change, (2) varied by cognitive domain, (3) varied by age, between the youngest-old and oldest-old, and (4) was significantly influenced by baseline SBP. Importantly, we found that, after accounting for attrition and baseline SBP, an increasing or persistently high PP was associated with less cognitive decline than in those with low, stable PP but only if baseline SBP was below the median. However, in those starting with higher baseline SBP, it was age, rather than PP group, that influenced cognitive decline the most, with increasing age being associated with greater decline. These findings underscore the importance of identifying the sources of heterogeneity within a population to understand the complex relationships between late life vascular health and cognitive decline and possibly help explain some of the discrepancies in the literature [4, 5, 8, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . In particular, they show the importance of looking at dynamic measures of cardiovascular factors, rather than assuming that these variables remain static over time and also of accounting for the individual's own baseline. These findings also reinforce the need for more nuanced approaches to treatment recommendations for cardiovascular disease in the elderly, particularly as they might relate to cognitive health.\nThere is strong evidence for the association of midlife cardiovascular risk factors and late life dementia. However, the association between late life hypertension and cognition remains unclear [1, 7, 21, 32, 37, 38] . Notable discrepancies exist among studies of blood pressure and cognition in the elderly, particularly in cross-sectional studies.

The interaction term between age and PP group indicates whether the difference in slopes between PP groups changes with age-a negative interaction indicates that the difference in cognitive slopes between that PP group and the reference group becomes smaller with increasing age, and a positive interaction indicates such difference becomes larger with increasing age. discrepancies may partly reflect the substantial heterogeneity in the timing and duration of experiencing hypertension, within the populations studied. The same baseline BP at study entry could represent a range of durations of prior exposure to hypertension or hypotension, thus exerting a variable impact on longitudinal outcomes of cognition. This variability might explain why hypertension in late life has been associated with an increased or decreased risk of dementia in different studies [37, 39] . Using a measure of BP that might reflect the chronicity of hypertension (e.g., PP) is one way of reducing variability in population studies. Examining longitudinal patterns of PP change allowed us to better capture different patterns of prior exposure to hypertension as manifested by arterial stiffness, which would not be possible in cross-sectional studies with a single measure. We were able to explore how changes in PP and cognition relate to each other, in late life and how baseline blood pressure further contributes to this, that is, where you start influences where you are going."}, {"section_title": "=", "text": "We used PP as it may provide a more informative measure than BP of the degree of cumulative arterial pathology resulting from hypertension and age. Furthermore, PP has been associated with magnetic resonance imaging measures of vascular disease [12, 13, 15, 40] , and arterial stiffness has recently been shown to be associated with the presence of cerebral amyloid, increased amyloid deposition over time [17] , and CSF and pathologic markers of AD [13, 41] . Importantly, changes in PP can occur with isolated changes in either SBP or DBP or with changes in both, with each scenario having different implications. However, in our population, PP changes were associated mostly with SBP changes (as PP increased, SBP increased) rather than DBP changes. This may partially account for the age-related differences that were identified in our population, that is, increasing age was also associated with increasing SBP.\nThe few studies that have looked at repeated measurements of both BP or arterial stiffness and cognition over time [21, [33] [34] [35] [36] 42] have had varying results. Unlike the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, we found that an increasing PP was not associated with a greater decline in memory and executive cognitive tests compared to those with a stable, low PP. Rather, in our models, an elevated or increasing PP was associated with less decline in memory, attention, and executive function. This difference could be partly due to our stratifying by baseline SBP. In another study, looking at baseline PP, rather than longitudinal change in PP, there was worsening cognition in both high and low PP in relation to the median quartile group [36] . In a recent study after change in BP in hypertensive patients over 6 years, both increase and decrease in SBP were associated with less decline on the MMSE [30] . Another study examining BP change over 13 years found a decrease in DBP was associated with worse visuospatial performance [5] . But, similar to our findings, those with persistently elevated SBP had no significant worsening over time in any cognitive function. The four PP trajectory groups that we identified appear to capture the major categories along a spectrum of possible patterns (stable high or low and increasing or decreasing). They also suggest that different pathways to a specific PP level, rather than the PP itself, have distinct implications for cognition. We can only speculate about the potential mechanisms underlying the noted associations between PP and cognition. These results might indicate that with advancing age, which is also associated with an age-related arterial stiffening, that cognitive function, particularly, executive function becomes increasingly reliant on an additional mechanisms such as adequate cardiac output. However, with advancing age and chronic exposure to higher PP this eventually becomes detrimental, as was supported by the findings in those starting with higher SBP. This was supported by a recent study showing that those with previously elevated SBP were at greatest risk for having evidence of regional white matter changes that support executive cognitive function [9] .\nIn the groups with slowly and rapidly increasingly PP, there was a general pattern of less decline in cognitive function that was most pronounced in those starting at lower SBP. Our findings support speculation that an initial elevation in PP might in fact provide some protection against the effects of hypoperfusion on cognition, particularly in the oldest-old. Although elevated PP has been associated with increase cognitive impairment in some studies [33] , this has not been a uniform finding [34, 36] . Consistent with our study, a recent study assessing the association of arterial stiffness, BP variability, and vascular risk factors in the elderly also found that in those with multiple vascular risk factors an elevated PP was actually protective for cognitive impairment [43] . These results also support calls to liberalize BP goals in the elderly compared to midlife hypertension [31, 37, 44, 45] .\nUnlike other studies, we explicitly addressed attrition in our cohort, recognizing not only the inevitability of dropout but also the likelihood of the cardiovascular disease and PP being associated with both cognition and dropout. Attrition also highlights the importance of taking into account the impact of those factors associated with dropout in longitudinal, population-based studies. In our case, we found that in the elderly an increasing or persistently elevated PP was actually associated with less cognitive decline. Furthermore, in those starting with higher SBP at study entry, increasing age was associated with less cognitive decline. This could indicate with age that BP treatment goals may have to consider distinct from midlife. Although our data show that the association between PP and cognition clearly varies by age (Fig. 2) , follow-up of our own cohort over a longer period of time could reveal the detrimental impact of elevated or rising PP, but the ideal longitudinal study would begin at or before midlife.\nThere are some limitations worth considering. Although ultrasound methods provide the more direct and precise measure arterial of stiffness, PP measurement is an easy and inexpensively measured surrogate with ready application to clinical and community settings. In addition, it is important to recognize that the use of manual sphygmomanometer in the elderly may result in \"pseudohypertension\" that is a result of peripheral artery changes rather than central artery vascular stiffness. It is possible that those with pseudohypertension are overrepresented in the decreasingly rapidly high PP group. If this were the case then decreasing PP could be a result of a change in cardiac output during the study which may differ from other causes of a decrease in PP, but this is speculation. Likewise, a false hypertension has been attributed to the stress of clinic evaluations, that is, white-coat hypertension, but this is unlikely a major issue with this population as all studies are done in home by research staff familiar to the participants. We also recognize that because of the size of our PP groups, we were limited in adjusting for all measures that differed between the groups, Table 1 ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In our elderly cohort, longitudinal changes in PP and cognition had different relationships that varied by age and cognitive domain and study entry blood pressure. In general, an increasing or higher PP seemed be associated with less cognitive decline in this elderly cohort, particularly in those starting out with lower systolic blood pressure. This work reinforces the need for longitudinal studies in heterogeneous population-based cohorts, ideally using a life-course approach. Our findings point to the possibility that different strategies may be needed for prevention and treatment at different ages. Future studies that identify ideal PP ranges across the aging spectrum may be helpful in further identifying preventative and therapeutic targets."}]
