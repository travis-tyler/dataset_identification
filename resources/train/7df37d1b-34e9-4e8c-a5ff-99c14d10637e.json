Out of the main risk factors for developing AD, age is the most influential one [1] . AD is characterized by continuous degradation involving a preclinical stage, followed by a phase of mild cognitive impairment, and ending with dementia in the strict sense [1, 2] . Experimental evidence indicates that pathophysiological alterations take place in the brain more than a decade before clinical decline [3, 4] . Therefore, the search for biomarkers for early diagnosis and development of disease-modifying treatments is an ongoing and challenging endeavor [5] .\nThe presence of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques is the main pathological hallmark of AD [3, 6, 7] . One emerging hypothesis about the progression of AD posits that these toxic proteins originate in a particular area and propagate throughout neural fibers in a prion-like manner [8] [9] [10] .\nNetwork neuroscience has proven useful for understanding the impact of psychiatric and neurological disorders on brain-wide networks ( [11, 12] and Supplementary Material). In particular, it has been shown that AD strongly disturbs connections between nodes [13, 14] , especially those nodes occupying a central role in the network (hub nodes) [15, 16] .\nIn this work, we investigated whether structural brain networks, as measured with diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), could serve as a tool in the diagnosis of prodromal dementia [15] . By using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, we first aimed to implement machine learning techniques to extract features that are altered in Alzheimer's dementia. We then incorporated data from the Nathan Kline InstituteRockland Sample (NKI) database and created dynamical models of normal aging and AD to estimate the earliest detectable stage associated with dementia in the simulated disease progression."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Fig. 1 presents a general overview of the proposed approach, which is described in the following sections."}, {"section_title": "Participants and MRI acquisition protocol", "text": "We used two publicly available data sets widely used in neuroimaging research: the ADNI (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/) [17] and NKI (http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/pro/ nki.html) [18] databases (see also Supplementary Material). Here, we used 39 normal controls and 39 age-and sex-matched patients with AD and mild dementia, meeting National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for probable AD (http://adni. loni.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/adni2-proceduresmanual.pdf). ADNI participants were then subdivided into amyloid-positive patients with AD (A1) and amyloidnegative healthy controls (A2) according to recommended standard uptake value ratio thresholds for the ADNI database [19] (Supplementary Material). These cohorts were used to generate a classifier predicting clinical AD dementia (Fig. 1A) and identify discriminative centrality metrics and brain regions allowing for such diagnosis (Fig. 1B) . Afterward, we included 52 adults (26 men and 26 women) with age ranging from 45 to 81 years (mean 6 standard deviation, 60.5 6 10.41) from the NKI data set. These individuals are healthy with no presumed covert neuropathology (Supplementary Material).\nWe divided the NKI data set into two different groups: (1) NKI-I and (2) NKI-II. We then simulated an experiment over 15 years whereby one group experienced normal aging (NKI-I group), whereas another group of age-and sex-matched individuals developed AD over the same period (NKI-II group) (Fig. 1C) . This second analysis allowed us to investigate how early structural network alterations associated with dementia take place in the simulated progression process (Fig. 1D) .

In this model, nodes can be in two possible states, infected or susceptible. Infected nodes are brain regions wherein the probability of the disease factor burden is greater than zero. By contrast, susceptible nodes are free of the disease factor but are susceptible to be infected from other nodes. In a network with N nodes, for any particular node i, the probability of being susceptible, s i , and the probability of being infected, x i , satisfy such that s i 1 x i 5 1. Thus, it is possible to express the rate of change of x i in the susceptible-infected model as [21] \nwhere a ij is an element of the (binary) adjacency matrix, whereas the parameter alpha, a.0, controls the infection rate of the node j over the node i. As we made use of weighted networks, we replaced equation (1) with\nIn equation (2), k j stands for the strength of node j, and the influence of the node j over the node i is now proportional to the weight w ij . We incorporated another equation simulating AD-related degradation in connectivity.

The term b N ij represents the normal aging process (subsection 2.3.2) to reflect the fact that patients also age. Therefore, the Alzheimer aging model (equations (2) and (3)) relies on three unknown parameters: a, b AD , and the seed region origin of the disease factor.

Connectome organization develops across the lifespan, with age and sex being two critical factors during this process [20, 23] . We created link-specific regression models to predict the number of streamlines from age-and gender-related effects. Inspired by Lim et al. [20] , the number of streamlines between region i and region j, w ij , can be expressed as a combination of P 5 4 variables or predictors (age, gender, age gender, age 2 ):\nwhere gender 5 1 for males and gender 5 21 for females.

Thus, we had 52 data points over the age range of 45 to 81 years for each of the 126 common connections.\nUpon deriving equation (4) with respect to the age effect, we obtained the following differential equation attempting to mimic the process for aging:\nIt has been shown that brain connectivity evolves in such a manner that core properties of structural networks (e.g., modular organization) remain stable during brain maturation and adulthood [20, 23, 25] , suggesting that rules governing neural fiber changes over time are dependent on connections. In mathematical terms, it means that some predictors from equation (4) can be irrelevant to predict the number of streamlines. We, therefore, applied the model-selection algorithm named subset selection (see [26] and Supplementary Material) to exclude variables not related to the response w ij . The outcome of this procedure was a set of link-specific regression models (equation (4)) and their corresponding differential equations (equation (5)), varying in complexity according to the number of included predictors.

[20] ."}, {"section_title": "Dynamical simulations", "text": "We applied the aforementioned normal aging model to the NKI-I group to create a cohort of simulated healthy controls evolving over 15 years. Similarly, we applied the Alzheimer aging model to the NKI-II group to reproduce the process of propagation of misfolded proteins and disruption of neural pathways throughout the same time window, creating a cohort of simulated patients with AD (see Fig. 1C and Supplementary Material).\nWe recorded the resulting simulated matrices in discrete points of a year and defined a set of 16 simulated stages for further analysis (Fig. 1D) . From this point on, we will be using the term \"stage\" rather than \"years\" to account for the fact that patients can develop AD at different rates. Thus, stage 15 represents the initial stage in which both groups of individuals (i.e., NKI-I and NKI-II groups) are in a healthy condition. By contrast, stage 0 represents the disease stage in which neural degeneration compromises cognitive functions enough to meet criteria for dementia. To assess the extent to which stage 0 reflects this criterion, we compared the differences in node strength obtained at stage 0 between simulated controls and simulated patients, with the counterpart differences measured between ADNI A2 controls and ADNI A1 patients. Specifically, we selected the parameter set \u00f0seed; a; b AD \u00de, minimizing the cost function defined by the Euclidean distance between k 0 NKI and k ADNI . The term k 0 NKI represents the size 82 vector incorporating differences in node strength measured between simulated controls and simulated patients at stage 0, and the term k ADNI stands for the size 82 vector containing the differences in node strength measured between ADNI A2 controls and ADNI A1 patients."}, {"section_title": "Feature extraction and machine learning analysis", "text": "We used the Brain Connectivity Toolbox v2017-15-01 (https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/) [27] and computed centrality measures of strength, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, and PageRank, producing 410 elements. Before computing the foregoing topological properties, the fraction of streamlines connecting each pair of regions was calculated [28] :\nwhere w kl represents the streamline counts connecting region k and region l. Centrality metrics were scaled within subjects having zero mean and unit variance. Then, we applied machine learning techniques, as implemented in the Scikit-Learn Package v0.19.0 [29] , to produce relevant features and brain patterns or signatures, classifying between clinically diagnosed ADNI controls and ADNI patients with dementia ( Fig. 1A and B) .\nWe used the random forest (RF) technique [26] with 1000 trees for feature selection [30, 31] , with the ultimate goal of reducing model complexity and improving interpretability. This method returned a set of scores (feature importance) that were used to rank features for subsequent classification. The classification was performed using the support vector machine (SVM) technique [32] . We trained SVMs with a radial basis function kernel with g 5 1/n feat (where n feat denotes the number of features). The parameter C of radial SVMs was selected within the set (1,10,100) to maximize model performance. To estimate model performance, we incorporated RF and SVM methods in a cross-validation scheme, which is explained in Supplementary Material. We applied this cross-validation scheme for each parameter C and selected the combination of parameter C and number of features providing the max area under the curve (AUC). Using such number of features, we performed a receiver operating characteristic analysis."}, {"section_title": "Predictions in the simulated disease progression", "text": "As we were also interested in estimating when alterations associated with dementia begin to be significantly apparent in the simulated progression process, a final SVM based on the identified features was fitted using all ADNI samples, and the resulting predictive model was independently tested on each NKI simulated stage (Fig. 1D) .

We used one-tailed binomial tests to evaluate the significance of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy [33] and the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test to evaluate the significance of AUC values [34] . We declared results as significant at P , :05. We further used false discovery rate-adjustment procedures [35] with q50:05 to control for multiple comparisons across stages within each performance measure. In all cases, we reported values of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy at the threshold for classification, providing the best tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity.\nWe incorporated the NKI data set to simulate 16 disease stages and their corresponding age-matched normal phases, relative to individuals following an AD-related pathological (NKI-II group) and healthy (NKI-I group) pathway. For the pathological pathway, different trajectories were simulated to identify the model parameters resembling dementia brain patterns at simulated stage 0 compared with the Fig. 2 .

Upon parameter optimization, the hippocampus was identified as the most likely site of origin of AD (with a 5 0:4 and b AD 5 0:025). Other regions, especially the amygdala and entorhinal cortex, are plausible seed candidates where AD first originates (Fig. 4) .\nUsing the hippocampus as the seed region, we produced connectivity matrices either representing individuals normally aging or individuals developing AD, and the ADNI classifier, which was only based on the relevant features associated with dementia (Fig. 3A) , was evaluated on these structural networks (Fig. 5A) . To estimate the cutoff stage from which network alterations associated with dementia begin to manifest structurally, we calculated the significance of the classification performance measures throughout the simulated progression span. Interestingly, we observed that the selected centrality metrics still capture significant dementia alterations at the simulated stage 7 (Fig. 5B) . The classification performance progressively improved as AD progressed (Fig. 5A) , achieving more accurate predictions as the effect of the disease becomes more prominent. Note that this improvement comes from the rise in the sensitivity index, whereas specificity remains relatively stable across simulated stages until stages 1 and 0, at which specificity decreases. At very early stages, both simulated controls (NKI-I subjects) and simulated patients (NKI-II subjects) are generally classified as controls, when the impact of dementia on brain connectivity is yet subtle.\nWe finally explored the evolution of predictions when the remaining 40 brain areas served as the seed region to initiate the propagation of the disease factor ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Those regions are most likely the site of origin of the disease (Fig. 4) and offer a gradual increase in classification performance throughout simulated stages. When AD simulation originated from the amygdala and the entorhinal cortex, performance measures were similar to the optimal seed (the hippocampus)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia", "text": "We first analyzed the ADNI data set with machine learning tools to explore whether structural networks inferred from diffusion MRI predict Alzheimer's dementia.

We then analyzed the mean receiver operating characteristic curve generated with the selected features. With the 86 more relevant features selected, we further evaluated their classification value with a 10-fold cross-validated SVM (with optimal parameters). At the optimal threshold for classification, the mean sensitivity was 79.16% (P 5 .147 ! 10 23 ), mean specificity 98.9% (P 5 1.81 ! 10 212 ), and mean accuracy 89.07% (P 5 6.9 ! 10 213 ), substantially higher than the empirical distribution (50%) (Fig. 2B) .\nThen, we identified the most discriminative centrality measures and brain regions providing such performance. Strength and closeness centrality together account for almost half of the relevant features (23.25% and 24.42%, respectively). Measures of eigenvector and pagerank centrality have a lesser influence for classification but still represent a considerable proportion of the retained features (19.77% in both cases). Betweenness centrality is the least representative measure in the final set of selected features, accounting for the remaining 12.79% ( Fig. 3A ; see also Supplementary Table 2 for a detailed listing of the selected features).

Hence, our model simulations suggest a valuable opportunity for risk assessment and early diagnosis.\nMoreover, our simulations highlight the possibility that a neural structure may be significantly compromised before cognitive deficits become evident enough for a clinical diagnosis, possibly due to compensatory plasticity [40] .

However, it is important to acknowledge that the relevant features were extracted from ADNI patients with dementia, which is not a prodromal phase. Thus, future research could incorporate data from patients at earlier stages (e.g., before or during the mild cognitive impairment phase and prodromal dementia) for a definitive validation. For instance, our model could be tested retrospectively for patients who were scanned within the UK Biobank project [44] before the disease onset. Importantly, one should include individuals with an age range in agreement with the simulated period because AD is an age-dependent disorder.\nOn the technical side, NKI and ADNI structural connectivity was reconstructed using deterministic tracking. Although probabilistic tracking could lead to a more accurate reconstruction, we used deterministic tracking in line with earlier studies in the NKI data set [20] . Also, owing to the FMRIB Software Library version that was used at the time of analysis, the old eddy_correct tool rather than the new more accurate eddy tool was used for eddy current and movement correction that could influence the reconstruction.\nAs patients might be affected by cerebrovascular diseases [45] and other copathologies such as alpha-synuclein [46] , the diagnosis could be enhanced by accounting for these comorbidities. Furthermore, as new information about the selective neural vulnerability in AD is gathered [47] , and more complex models could be implemented to mimic mechanisms of degeneracy and reserve [11] .
