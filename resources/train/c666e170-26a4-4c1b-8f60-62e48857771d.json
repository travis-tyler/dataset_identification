After adjusting for facility caseload of reproductive-aged women, 3 organizational factors were independently associated with onsite IUD placement: (1) onsite gynecologist (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 20.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 7.02 to 58.74; Po.001); (2) hospitalbased in contrast to community-based practice (adjusted OR, 5.49; 95% CI, 1.16 to 26.10; P =.03); and (3) availability of a clinician providing women's health training to other clinicians (adjusted OR, 3.40; 95% CI 1.19 to 9.76; P =.02).\nCONCLUSIONS: VA's provision of hormonal and intrauterine contraception is in accordance with community standards, although onsite availability is not universal. Although contraception is a crucial component of a woman's health maintenance, her ability to obtain certain contraceptives from the facility where she obtains her primary care is largely influenced by the availability of a gynecologist. Further research is needed to determine how fragmentation of women's care into reproductive and nonreproductive services impacts access to contraception and the incidence of unintended pregnancy.

VA health care delivery is nationally structured into 22 (now 21) regional networks, each composed of a number of regionally clustered VA Medical Centers with affiliated Community-Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). The WVHP Survey aimed to ascertain the structure, policies, and scope of women's health care through key informants at the network (Network Director, N =22), medical center (Chief of Staff, N =140), and clinic (Senior Clinician, N =166) levels, targeting sites that delivered outpatient care to 4001 women veterans in fiscal year 2000 (October 1, 1999 through September 30, 2000). 13, 15 Survey response rates were 100%, 91%, and 82%, respectively. Other survey details are described elsewhere. 13, 15 Contextual factors were extracted from other secondary data sources. We merged the 1995 rural/urban continuum codes from the 2000 Area Resource File 16 to each VA facility at the county level. We used geographic regions as designated by the U.S. Census Bureau. 17 Information regarding contraceptive state laws and estimates of family planning clinic concentration and unmet need were obtained from public use datasets from the Alan Guttmacher Institute. 18, 19 Finally, we used the VA outpatient clinic database to measure facility-specific women veteran caseloads. 20 This project was approved by the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System's Institutional Review Board."}, {"section_title": "Outcome Measure", "text": "We examined the provision of 2 contraceptive services: (1) prescription and management of hormonal contraception; and (2) IUD placement. Data about the type (estrogen, progesterone) or route (injection, oral) of hormonal contraception were not available. Clinic-level respondents were prompted to specify service arrangements as ''available at that VA site,'' ''only available at another VA site,'' ''available through contract or fee-basis at a non-VA site,'' or ''not available.'' We dichotomized this measure to focus on onsite provision (yes/no)."}, {"section_title": "Organizational and Environmental Characteristics", "text": "Variable selection was based upon a conceptual model predicting that the capacity to provide IUD services onsite would be affected by the following factors: local practice arrangements, resource sufficiency, and education/training (Table 1) . Using these domains, we mapped a series of organizational variables from the WVHP Survey: (1) type of women's health practice model; (2) hospital-based practice versus CBOC; (3) frequency of assignment to same-gender providers; (4) availability of an onsite gynecologist; (5) integration of women's with men's primary care services; (6) local authority over women's health care; (7) sufficiency of practice resources (e.g., space, equipment); (8) separate budget authority for women's health; and (9) presence of local women's health expertise for training other clinicians.\nWe examined the contribution of 4 women's health practice models 13 : (1) use of designated women's health providers in primary care, (2) separate women's health clinics for primary care, (3) use of both designated women's health providers and separate women's health clinics, and (4) neither arrangement. Integrated versus separate arrangements for women's and men's primary care were assessed along a 9-point ordinal scale, from completely integrated to completely separate. We examined sufficiency of 5 practice resources: samegender providers, nursing staff, clinic space, clinical expertise in women's health, and equipment for pelvic exams (quantified within a range of ''never'' to ''always'' sufficient). We evaluated local clinical authority over women's health (from ''little'' to ''complete'') for 5 aspects of service delivery: determining Under the assumption that the environment forms the context in which services are provided, thereby influencing both patient demand and organizational willingness to provide procedural services, we included 4 environmental variables in our analysis: (1) geographic region; (2) urbanization; (3) family planning clinic concentration in the surrounding county; and (4) whether the state in which the facility resided had enacted an Equity in Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive Coverage (EPICC) law. Although the VA is a federal agency, not subject to state laws, EPICC enactment serves as a contextual factor insofar as state laws characterize the state's political environment.\nWe controlled for the number of female patients between the ages of 18 (lower limit of VA patient eligibility) and 45 (standard upper limit of a woman's fertility) with at least 1 clinic visit in 2000."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "The unit of analysis was the clinical practice. We had complete data for the outcome variables at the clinic level for 126 facilities (76% final response rate). Respondents did not vary significantly from nonrespondents in geographic region or female caseload.\nItem-level frequencies for hormonal and intrauterine service availability were calculated. We performed univariate analyses of each independent variable, ran logit plots of continuous and ordinal variables to assess linearity, and performed square root transformations for those with marked skew (e.g., female caseload). We then used bivariate analyses, including t-tests, w 2 test, and Wilcoxon's rank sum tests (for ordinal data) to compare organizational and environmental characteristics of facilities with and without onsite IUD placement. We screened for predictors at a modest level of a =0.2 for potential use in the multivariate model. 21 Missing item response was highest for survey data on the proportion of female patients assigned to a female primary care physician (73% complete) and on a separate women's health budget control point (72% complete). As the separate women's health budget control-point item was included on both clinic level and medical center level surveys, it was first imputed using medical center level data, resulting in 91% completeness. Other survey-derived independent variables were chiefly complete, with an average of 4 missing item responses per survey. We used hot-deck imputation for survey variables that screened in after bivariate analyses to generate a complete data set (n =126). [22] [23] We then performed forward stepwise logistic regression (Po.10) to select a model using the screened predictors. To address potential interactions, 3 prespecified interaction terms were included for potential subset selection: (1) women's health budget authority by onsite gynecologist; (2) women's health budget authority by volume of reproductive-aged female patients; and (3) onsite gynecologist by volume of reproductive-aged female patients. We performed 30 cross-validation runs and kept the independent variables appearing in the majority of runs for use in the final multivariate model.

To wit, over a third of surveyed facilities relied on a referral system for IUD access. Referral systems, however, rely on the skills and knowledge of the referring clinician to appropriately counsel and select candidates for referral. Current data suggest that clinicians who do not perform IUD insertions are likely to lack these skills. A previous study of gynecologists, family, and general practitioners found that physicians without experience inserting the copper IUD not only did not perform insertions, but were also likely not to recommend the device to any of their patients. 6 Another survey of internal medicine and family practice residents demonstrated that primary care residents are generally not well prepared to counsel women regarding reproductive issues such as family planning. 24 Lack of local expertise with the IUD may, therefore, effectively shift the knowledge burden onto the patient to inquire about and utilize this contraceptive, though prior studies demonstrate that a substantial minority of women have poor or limited knowledge about the IUD 25 and other methods. 26, 27 Despite the growth of VA women's health clinics over the past decade, the strongest predictor of onsite IUD placement was the presence of an onsite gynecologist. As the vast majority of VA primary care clinicians are general internists, gynecologists may be the only clinicians within a facility with the training to perform IUD insertions. Though contraception is a routine preventive service 28, 29 whose place, many experts argue, is within the realm of primary care, [30] [31] [32] our results demonstrate that access to specialists has been a necessary ingredient in VA's ability to offer onsite access to a wider range of contraceptives. Integration of family physicians with these skills may provide opportunities to further enhance IUD access in VA settings, decreasing reliance on specialty referrals, which have been shown to serve as a barrier to obtaining contraceptive services in the community. Similarly, we found that the availability of a clinician who provided training to other staff members in women's health significantly increased the odds that IUDs would be available. Sites with specialized women's health clinics are more likely to have such capacity. These results are consistent with other studies which document, conversely, that lack of provider training poses substantial barriers to adding contraceptive methods to a facility's repertoire of services. 11, 34 Not surprisingly, hospital-based practices were more likely than CBOCs to provide IUDs onsite. Other studies report similar results. 9, 10 Notably, the establishment of CBOCs was 1 VA strategy for improving access to primary care by decreasing veterans' travel distance to services. In 1998, the average distance between a CBOC and its parent VA medical facility was still 70.7 miles. 35 Referrals to another facility to obtain contraception could incur significant opportunity costs for patients in time and travel. On the other hand, previous work has shown that the proportion of female patients is smaller at CBOCs than at their parent VA facility, 36, 37 which may, in part, account for the smaller likelihood and need that IUD services be available onsite. Certainly there exists a tension between the need to provide access to a contraceptive service and the need to ensure high-quality care for a procedure with volume-related competency standards. Establishing referral systems for low-demand procedures requiring adequate skill level is a rational way to provide services, but suggests that mechanisms are needed to ensure referral efficiency and service quality for patients referred to non-VA sites. Unfortunately, data on the quality of women veterans' health services at non-VA contract sites are currently unavailable. Interestingly, alternate practice arrangements for primary care delivery (e.g., designated women's health providers) did not independently predict onsite IUD availability. Hormonal contraception was provided regardless of the format of women's primary care, and IUD contraception did not vary based on the presence or absence of a women's health clinic for primary care. As gynecology clinics are typically distinct from most VA women's health clinics, which are instead commonly staffed by general internists and nurse practitioners, it appears that the staffing mix and degree to which women's health specialists are integrated into broader training programs are more important than the specific delivery model used. ''Women's health centers'' have become a blanket term to describe a diverse array of women's health care models-breast centers, primary care clinics, and family planning clinics 38 -each catering to only a portion of women's health care needs. These models illustrate the fragmentation of women's health care with respect to contraceptive access, they may play their central role by piecing together needed expertise in a multidisciplinary fashion rather than delivering all services themselves. Our analysis had several limitations. Although we demonstrated the association of several organizational characteristics to the availability of intrauterine contraception, such availability is also likely influenced by unmeasured physician characteristics. Most of the variables, including our outcome, were based on self-reported data. Under a Congressional mandate to provide comprehensive women's health care, respondents may have been more likely to bias their responses to reflect a greater level of service availability for women veterans. Additionally, our outcome measure was contraceptive availability, not utilization. Finally, these data reflect VA care patterns, where women comprise a minority of the population. Application of these findings to other health care organizations, where women are more likely to represent a majority of the patient population, is as yet unclear."}, {"section_title": "33", "text": "Contraceptive care is an integral component of health maintenance for women. We found that availability of hormonal contraception in the VA was almost ubiquitous. Intrauterine contraception, while offered less often, was still widely available. The first such assessment outside of the publicly funded family planning agency literature, our findings reiterate previous arguments that women's preventive reproductive health care is a specialized service. Our data offer insight into factors that influence the provision of comprehensive onsite contraceptive services, perhaps 1 potential solution to our country's high rate of unintended pregnancy. Further research is needed to determine how fragmentation of women's health services impacts access to contraception and, more importantly, the incidence of unintended pregnancy. Future work should explore the cost-effectiveness of alternate staffing and referral patterns, considering the potential value of partnerships between general internists, family physicians, and gynecologists in better integrating reproductive procedural services in VA women's health clinics and integrated primary care clinics."}]
