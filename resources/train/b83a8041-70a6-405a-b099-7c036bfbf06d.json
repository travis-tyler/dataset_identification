Lack of field data sets, model assumptions, and limitations often lead to wrong interpretation of the system's nature. To correctly predict the changes in governing hydrodynamics and morphology of shallow wetland environments, it is essential to resolve the complex interaction between the tidal channel and marsh surface with the best possible accuracy. In this thesis, we describe the development of a high-resolution 2D numerical model for a rapidly eroding tidal wetland system using the Finite-Volume, primitive equation Community Ocean Model (FVCOM). Topobathymetric survey data and water surface and current velocity measurements during calm and stormy conditions have been collected in support of model development and validation. The model is then used to perform a morphology scenario analysis to evaluate the effect of anthropogenic and natural disturbances in altering overall wetland hydrodynamics. The study has also shown the role of horizontal model resolution around the marsh channel shoreline and surveyed bathymetry data in improving the model calculations for major physical processes such as channel surface phase lag, tidal wave characteristics, and flow asymmetry. Hydrodynamic processes over marsh topography are seen to be significantly affected by surface defects such as cuts and rills on the marsh platform. Inadequate representation of these meter-scale features from spatial resolution available from data sources such as LiDAR, as well as the incomplete resolution in the model grid itself, lead to artificial ponding over the isolated marsh depressions, with resulting effects on estimates of sediment fluxes and hydroperiod. A xxi new set of mass and momentum conservation equations is proposed using a surface porosity technique to improve the dynamic wetting and drying over artificially isolated depressions. This model improvement is essential for accurate predictions of marsh hydroperiod and volume flux that primarily controls the sedimentation rate and overall morphological evolution. Ultimately, by solving these critical processes, the study has provided useful solutions to improve the present-day limitations in numerical modeling of salt marsh flooding and draining."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Coastal wetlands are dynamic landscapes that occur in the intertidal zone between land and the sea, and involve continuous feedback between hydrodynamic forces, vegetation types and sediment erosion/accretion. They act as a natural defense system to protect the coastal communities and provide an essential buffer against storm surge, wind waves, and even tsunamis. However, the salt marshes in the U.S. have been disappearing recently at an increasing rate due to various natural and anthropogenic processes such as sea-level rise, severe meteorological events, and man-made morphology changes. According to US EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency), the rate was more than 80,000 acres per year between 2004 and 2009 and 59,000 acres per year from 1998 to 2004 (http://epa.gov/wetlands/coastal-wetlands) due to a variety of commercial, residential, industrial activities and conversion for agricultural uses. The wetland geomophology and tidal processes depend on each other (Dronkers, 1986). An abrupt change in the morphology can directly affect the hydrodynamics, which in turn alter the formation of the wetland over a short or long term (e.g. Speer, 1984). Over the years, the construction of artificial structures such as levees and canals have changed the course of tidal hydrodynamics in many coastal wetlands, ultimately leading to marsh habitat alteration and destruction (Williams, 1995). Single events, such as violent storms, have caused numerous breaches and formed new inlets that changed the wetland-Bay dynamics (Ramsey and Reilly, 2002;Aretxabaleta et al., 2017). The Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge (BHNWR), DE, is one of the largest remaining expanses of tidal wetlands in the mid-Atlantic region and has lost almost 20% of its salt marsh area since 1949 from a combination of anthropogenic and natural activities (McDowell, 2017). Artificial channels and oxbows were constructed to connect the interior marsh to Delaware Bay to improve the marsh drainage (Dozier, 1947). Over the years, the system's main channels have progressively deepened and widened, and several tidal mudflats have formed, making it more ebb dominant and erosive in nature (Deb et al., 2018a). In light of the importance of the BHNWR to both the ecology and economy of the Delaware coastal environment, we needed a robust high-resolution numerical modeling system to identify the major causes responsible for changing the tidal hydrodynamics. In Chapter 2, we have described the development of a high-resolution two-dimensional model system for the entire BHNWR tidal wetland environment based on the Finite-Volume, primitive equation Community Ocean Model (FVCOM, Chen et al. (2013)). The unstructured grid developed for BHNWR covers the entire marsh system with sufficient grid resolution to resolve small channels and creeks. The model performance is validated using surface elevation at several tidal gauges, ADCP current velocity data collected from the major channels, and pressure data over the marsh platform. The effects of a historical man-made channel construction, ongoing channel deepening, and a potential inlet opening in shifting wetland hydrodynamics are shown by developing a scenario analysis. Tidal asymmetry is estimated in the marsh interior and inlets to show the role of morphology changes in system's continuous progression toward a frictionless regime. Finally, the results are explained using simple inlet-channel-bay relationship and scaling analysis to highlight the primary balance between the governing forces. Developing a highly precise wetland/salt-marsh 2D model is a challenging task as it requires an understanding of the optimum grid resolution and, more importantly availability of high-resolution data sets of marsh topography and channel bathymetry. During the hydrodynamic model development in Chapter 2, we have noticed two important present-day modeling limitations associated with flooding and draining in both the inter-tidal channels and marsh platforms. First, an increase or decrease of the channel resolution in the model can change the hypsometry and directly affect the flow continuity and momentum. In a marsh-channel environment with sharp bathymetry gradients, an inadequate representation of the channel berms can influence the baychannel volume flux, and also the volume of water that goes back and forth between the channel and marsh surface. Channel properties and inter-tidal storage, along with the oceanic forcing, controls the tidal asymmetry (i.e., flood/ebb dominance) and overall stability of a tidal wetland (Aubrey and Speer, 1985;Speer et al., 1991;Friedrichs, 2010). Sediment transport directly correlates with the surface elevation/velocity asymmetry, which can be in the form of magnitude and period of the tidal wave (Friedrichs and Aubrey, 1988;Nidzieko, 2010). An accurate estimate of tidal asymmetry and wave characteristics is essential for determining the residual flow, direction, and sediment budget. Therefore, to have a reliable estimate of the tidal amplitude, phase speed, and asymmetry, it is necessary to correctly resolve the land-water flow exchange and channel hypsometry with optimum spatial grid resolution. In addition to the adequate grid resolution, a high-density bathymetry data is also needed to properly represent the channel hypsometry in model calculations (Yu and Lane, 2006;Horritt et al., 2006). The improper geometric representation from sparse survey data can heavily constrain the model performance. In Chapter 3, we have demonstrated why it is essential to resolve the variation in channel hypsometry with a higher accuracy that improves model reliability for the prediction of tidal characteristics. The changes in along-channel surface phase lag for different geometric conditions is also explained using the 1D Saint Venant equations for irregular cross-sections, which has given an essential insight on the sensitivity of tidal waves to channel properties. After observing an improved channel flooding and draining, we looked into the model performance over the marsh platform. We noticed that the inundation process over marsh surface is significantly affected by surface defects such as cuts and rills on channel berms and narrow creeks on the platform. Channel embankments or berms form hydraulic depressions on the marsh platform that flood during the high tide and drains slowly through small cuts and rills during ebb. These meter-scale features are often missing in the model representation due to the spatial resolution available from data sources, as well as incomplete resolution in the model grid itself. Inadequate representation of the ground irregularities in the model leads to the formation of artificial hydraulic depressions and changes the marsh flooding and draining process. The geomorphological developments in salt marshes depend on the sea level and tidal oscillations, where the plant growth and sedimentation are controlled by hydroperiod and advection of fine sediments from the channels (Fagherazzi et al., 2012). The vegetation biomass growth rate depends particularly on tidal amplitude, period, and local elevation, resulting in multiple vegetation types that dominate different zones (Morris, 2006). With the growing availability of computational resources, to predict the long-term marsh evolution, a range of process-based physical models are being used nowadays to resolve marsh overland flooding and draining and sediment transport with the highest resolution possible (e.g. Zhang et al., 2019). The artificial ponding seen over marsh depressions can lead to incorrect modeling of vegetation dynamics, and of the volume and speed of flooding and draining processes, ultimately leading to an inaccurate marsh platform geomorphological evolution. In Chapter 3, we have implemented a surface porosity technique in the mass and momentum conservation equations to improve the inundation process in artificially isolated depressions in the FVCOM model. We proposed the new set of equations based on the existence of narrow cuts and rills over the channel berms. Our modeling strategy is conceptually similar to Chen et al. (2000) and Kennedy et al. (2000) in defining the time-varying slot area, but differs in porosity calculations based on the representation of marsh elevation. We made the modifications primarily to eliminate artificial ponding effects observed in hydrodynamic model simulations for any given Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The model performance is tested using different idealized marsh conditions to explain the slot mechanism in simple and well-defined artificial ponds. Using the same setup, we have also shown the sensitivity of model flooding and draining to the variation in slot geometry and bottom roughness. Finally, we verified our proposed strategy against an extensive set of pressure measurements obtained from a real marsh depression in"}, {"section_title": "BHNWR.", "text": "The work presented in Chapter 2 and 3 is under review, and Chapter 4 is in preparation for journal publications. analyzed the status and trends of wetland acreage along the Atlantic Coast, Gulf of Mexico, and the Great Lakes and reported that 361,000 acres of coastal wetlands were lost in the Eastern United States alone between 1998 and 2004 (Stedman and Dahl, 2008). These changes are possibly due to a number of various anthropogenic and natural processes such as sea level rise, man-made morphology changes, overgrazing by native and migratory species, and severe meteorological events. Historically, the Mid-Atlantic region has lost coastal wetlands due to the variety of commercial, residential, industrial activities and conversion for agricultural uses (EPA, 2010). Coastal wetlands have also been particularly affected by conversion of tidal wetlands to open water by construction of impoundments and sea level rise (Tiner, 1987). Construction of levees and canals have changed the course of tidal inundation in many coastal wetlands, and led to marsh habitat alteration and destruction (Williams, 1995). During large storm events, the wetland systems are often affected by the offshore storm surge and waves, where the storm induced breaching changes the bay-inlet-ocean dynamics and the volume exchange (Aretxabaleta et al., 2017). In the state of Delaware, along Delaware River, numerous breaches were recorded over the last century from historical storms that caused dramatic changes in the wetland ecosystems (Ramsey and Reilly, 2002;Runion, 2019). The Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge (BHNWR), DE is one of the largest remaining expanses of tidal wetlands in the mid-Atlantic region and has lost almost 20% of its salt marsh area since 1949 ( Figure 2.1). Over the years, this multiinlet salt marsh system has gone through a combination of anthropogenic (Dozier, 1947) and natural changes (Ramsey and Reilly, 2002), shifting its tidal dynamics from time to time. In light of the importance of the BHNWR to both the ecology and economy of the Delaware coastal environment, it is essential to obtain a better functional understanding and predictive capability of the system's morphological evolution. The coastal wetland morphology and tidal processes are interdependent on each other, and an abrupt change in the estuarine morphology by any anthropogenic or natural processes could affect the hydrodynamics which in turn alter the evolution of the estuary (Speer, 1984;Dronkers, 1986). The hydrodynamic regime, including asymmetry in the system (i.e., flood/ebb dominance during spring/neap tide) and inter-tidal storage controls the net volume exchange, residual volume transport and overall stability of a tidal wetland (Aubrey and Speer, 1985;Speer et al., 1991;Friedrichs, 2010). The tidal asymmetry can be represented in two ways, 1) using duration asymmetry that measures the difference in duration and/or amplitude between rising and falling tide (slack water difference), and 2) using velocity skewness that characterizes the ebb and flood current distribution over a tide cycle (peak velocity skew) (Nidzieko and Ralston, 2012). The difference in slack water period between ebb and flood generally affects the residual flux of the fine suspended load, where the difference between maximum tidal currents during ebb and flood particularly affects the bed load transport (Dronkers, 1986). While the duration asymmetry is controlled by the variation in channel volume and the intertidal volume of adjacent shoals (Speer, 1984;Friedrichs, 2010), the velocity skew can generate from the local bathymetry gradients, quadratic friction and the phase lags between the surface gradient and local depth (Nidzieko and Ralston, 2012). Boon and Byrne (1981) and Speer (1984) have investigated a few inlet/estuary systems in the U.S. east coast, where Murrells Inlet, SC and Nauset Inlet, MA are observed to be flood dominant (longer falling tide and a higher current velocity during flood at the inlet) and Wachapreague Inlet, VA is identified as ebb dominant (shorter ebb duration and a stronger ebb current). An important distinction is also noticed by Speer (1984) in Pamet River, MA, where a shorter rising duration asymmetry exist with the ebb dominant inlet discharge as the interior falling tide decouples from the offshore falling tide. The net residual sediment transport in a system is related to tidal asymmetry and phase difference between surface elevation and flow velocity (Hsu et al., 2013;Ralston et al., 2013), and in order to predict the morphology evolution of such short in-  "}, {"section_title": "Regional description", "text": "The marshes of BHNWR provide a buffer to adjacent communities and large areas of highly productive farmlands. The refuge itself is a key component of the local economy where it provides nearly $100M/year in ecosystem services such as clean water, fisheries habitat and carbon sequestration (Kauffman et al., 2011). During a large Nor'easter storm in May 2008, the refuge's impoundment boundary was breached by water for the first time in the history of refuge management, illustrating the increasing vulnerability of the wetlands and freshwater impoundments to storms and sea level rise. The BHNWR wetland system originally had three natural tidal inlets, namely the Leipsic River, the Simon River and the Woodland Beach, and based on historical evidence (Dozier, 1947;Ramsey and Reilly, 2002), the channel depths were much lower than the present condition. A new channel Sluice Ditch is constructed in 1890 to connect the marsh interior at Duck Creek directly to the Delaware Bay (Dozier, 1947). Additionally, several oxbows in the course of the Leipsic River were straightened prior to 1900 and also during that year, which changed the drainage system of wet areas. In the last couple of decades, the main channels of the system have progressively  Figure 2.1, we can also see that the system has different trends in the disturbed and undisturbed regions. In one part, three of the inlets: Leipsic River, Sluice Ditch and and Woodland Beach are connected to each other by the major channels and it is considered as the disturbed region, while the other part, Simon River inlet is mostly separated from the system and has less overall erosion. Simon River has a few smaller channels that connect to the Leipsic River during high tide and becomes extremely shallow at other times, making it less vulnerable to the ongoing channel deepening and erosion. Beside the internal marsh and channel erosion, the marsh shoreline with the Delaware Bay has also gone through significant erosion over the years due to local wind wave thrust on the scarp edge (Chen et al., 2018). All these historic and ongoing erosive processes in BHNWR have been carefully taken into consideration for different morphology scenario analysis, performed at the later part of the study."}, {"section_title": "Model setup and validation", "text": "FVCOM solves seven primitive governing equations for momentum, incompressible continuity, temperature, salinity and density.

A small error in boundary forcing can misrepresent the hydrodynamic processes (e.g., marsh surface wetting/drying) in a wetland system and can lead to subsequent errors in further estimations. ROMS simulations were performed for the years of 2012 and 2015 (Kukulka et al., 2017;Rodrigues, 2016) on a regular curvilinear grid of the Delaware bay with offshore extent to the continental shelf boundary, covering the entire Delaware Bay and estuary as is shown in Figure 2.2a (Abdolali et al., 2016).

Tide gauge close to the Bay (Navigation Light) is observed to have a higher correlation and skill score of 0.99 and 1.0, respectively, than the other interior gauges (Figure 2.5). The averaged bias index and slope of the regression line show that the model under-predicts during falling tide. Inside the wetland, scatter seems to increase at Leatherberry and Shearness, where the correlation coefficient and skill reduces to 0.98 and 0.99. Overall, they both show a similar trend where model under-predicts during high tide and then over-predicts at low tide. Moving further to the most upstream gauge (Dock), model accuracy decreases more and now over-predicts during both tidal conditions, prominently during the low tide. After looking into the model performance for a seven month period, we have parted it for different hurricane conditions to evaluate the bias primarily coming from subtidal signals and flawed marsh flooding and draining. To begin with, we looked into surface elevation time series during Hurricane Sandy and Hurricane Joaquin at Delaware Bay NOAA tide gauge location (Figure 2.6). The model skill is 0.99 for both events, and the negative sign on the low average bias index value represents a slight under-prediction by the model. We can see that the subtidal correction is much more accurate for Hurricane Joaquin compared to Hurricane Sandy, and has a smaller bias during the main surge event. The comparison at the BHNWR tide gauges is shown in Figure 2.7 for Hurricane Sandy, again revealing higher model skill at the tide gauge close to the Bay (Navigation Light). It shows an increase in the scatter at interior channel gauges when surge inundates the entire marsh platform. Some distinct scatter appears in all the interior gauges during one specific tidal cycle at the end of the surge, where the model overestimates surface elevation and also develops a phase lag due to gradual draining from the marsh platform. Water surface elevation is collected along a transect on the marsh surface throughout the year 2015, using HOBO water level loggers. Locations of the HOBO gauges in the marsh are shown in Figure 2 that is mainly coming from a higher phase lag. The similar trend can be also noticed in longer-term comparison we have shown earlier. The results at the six HOBO stations presented in Figure 2.9 show that FVCOM does a reasonable job of predicting maximum inundation depths over the marsh platform. However the model results show an elevated minimum depth compared to the in-situ measurements. A systematic error associated with marsh elevation shown by the red line cut off and model grid elevation shown by the horizontal black line, is seen. The differences between the base of the red and black lines are related to horizontal interpolation, resolution errors and smoothing from high resolution LiDAR data to get the model DEM, followed by an added error in interpreting local depth in a low order triangulated grid system. These errors are usually comparable to the vertical resolution errors that are inherent to the LiDAR measurement. From the surface elevation comparison, the model was seen to exhibit one particular problem during marsh draining phase, artificial ponding, where an extra water storage is apparent for the entire time at HOBO location 3 to 6. The model performance is further assessed for the current velocity variable at two ADCP locations.

Of these, the Sluice Ditch channel is an artificially opened inlet (Dozier, 1947). where mid-channel depth close is to 10.0 m in Leipsic River and Sluice Ditch ( Figure   2.11b, bottom left). The first scenario is a step toward simulating historical conditions that were possibly in effect before the start of major erosional changes in the system. We have made no corresponding attempt to narrow channels or recreate river oxbows that have been straightened. We also note that the tidal flat areas such as Money (2)). To look into the tidal asymmetry and flood/ebb dominance of the system, a month long simulation for an entire spring-neap cycle is done under regular tidal forcing that produces minimum marsh artificial ponding (i.e., M 2 and S 2 tidal constituents taken from a nearest NOAA tide gauge). All model parameters were kept the same as described earlier in section 2.3.2. The inlets can show cross-channel spatial asymmetry, therefore, the total volume flux going in and out of the system is calculated across each inlet and shown in Figure 2.12, along with the mid-channel velocity to show the nature of hydrodynamics at the deeper part. We have quantified an asymmetry parameter \u03b3 0 following Nidzieko and Ralston 2012  where the k-th moment from zero can be defined as Here, N is the number of samples n i . The tide is ebb dominant for \u03b3 0 (U ) < 0 and flood dominant for \u03b3 0 (U ) > 0 (U is the depth averaged velocity), and the duration of falling water is longer than rising if \u03b3 0 (\u03b7 t ) > 0.   .13: Asymmetry parameter \u03b3 0 calculated following the equations given by Nidzieko and Ralston (2012). Here, \u03b3 0 (\u03b7 t ) represents the duration asymmetry, \u03b3 0 (U ) is the depth averaged velocity skewness, and \u03b3 0 (Q) is the integrated inlet volume flux skewness. The tide is ebb dominant for \u03b3 0 (U ) < 0 and flood dominant for \u03b3 0 (U ) > 0, and the duration of falling water is longer than rising if \u03b3 0 (\u03b7 t ) > 0.  Now, to understand these changes in the system's interior from the artificial opening in a mechanistic way, we have also used a simple inlet-channel-bay model that connects the wetland interior to the offshore by separate inlets. The Money marsh mudflat (where Leatherberry tide gauge is located) acts like a small Bay system which in reality is connected to the Delaware Bay by two separate major inlet channels, both in the first and second scenario. The major difference between both scenarios can be understood from Figure 2.16a. We can see the dramatic change in the ocean-inlet-bay system after introducing the new channel, where the interior now has a much shorter connection and higher depth for the tidal exchange compared to the first scenario. Here, we use the ocean-inlet-bay analytical model proposed by Aretxabaleta et al. (2017) to evaluate the first-order response of the bay to ocean sea level forcing. Aretxabaleta et al. (2017) studied a similar shallow estuarine system in southern Long Island, New York along the Atlantic Ocean, and developed the bay water level expression (Equation 2.5.3) using along-channel depth-averaged momentum equation. Based on the simple balance between local inertia, frictional effects and pressure gradient, the momentum and continuity equations can be written as where A e and \u03b7 e are the surface area and sea level in the bay; \u03b7 o the sea level in the ocean; with h n the water depth; u n the depth-averaged velocity; W n the width and L n the length of channel n, and r is the linear drag coefficient (\u2248 8c d 3\u03c0 u), for n = 1, 2. Assuming \u03b7 = \u03b7e i\u03c9t and u = ue i\u03c9t yields the following equation: where, w is the radian frequency of the ocean tidal oscillation and rn hn is the characteristics frequency of frictional dissipation in the channel. From the denominator in the Equation 2.5.3, we can also estimate the undamped natural frequency w N of the interior bay (Helmholtz frequency) as As the characteristics frequency of channel frictional dissipation increases from lower depth and higher friction, it reduces the frictional adjustment time and increases the interior amplitude damping. According to Chuang and Swenson (1981), when Table 2.1: Channel-Bay properties inside BHNWR, Tidal period, T = 12.42 hrs; Money marsh mudflat area, A e = 1.0 \u00d7 10 6 m 2 ; Drag coefficient, r = 3.0 Scenario 1 100m 5m 17km 200m 2m 19km 3.96 \u00d7 10 \u22124 5.4 Scenario 2 100m 5m 17km 100m 5m 10km 4.96 \u00d7 10 \u22124 2.4 Current bathy 100m 8m 17km 100m 10m 10km 6.75 \u00d7 10 \u22124 1.0 rn/hn w N > 1.0, the range of water level variation inside the bay is always less than the ocean, and for a rn/hn w N \u2264 1.0 the response is opposite. Based on the ocean-inlet-bay properties in our first and second scenario and ocean surface elevation from the FVCOM model, we have estimated the changes in channel frictional dissipation, natural frequency of the system and the decay time (Table 2.1). The analytical model result is shown in Figure 2.16b for different morphology scenarios, and we can see that the amplitude response \u03b7 e in the bay (marsh mudflat) mimic results seen from the numerical model in Figure 2.15a (Leatherberry gauge). To check the primary role of the inlet length and depth only, we kept the linear drag coefficient equal to 3.0 \u00d7 10 \u22123 that normally varies based on the channel depth. The ratio of amplitude decay time rn hn and undamped natural frequency w N is observed to be 5.4 for the first scenario due to the shallow (h 2 \u223c 2.0m) and long (L 2 \u223c 19km) inlet channel going toward the Woodland Beach. After adding the man-made channel (Sluice Ditch), we can see that the shorter and deeper side (h 2 \u223c 5.0m and L 2 \u223c 10km) has reduced the characteristics frequency of channel frictional dissipation, increased the natural frequency, and ultimately reduced the ratio to 2.4. From the surface elevation comparison in Figure 2.16b, we can see a bigger tidal range and reduced bay amplitude damping compared to the first scenario, also shown in FVCOM results (Figure 2.15a). Scenario 1 -No Sluice Ditch, and the interior is connected via Lepsic River and the Woodland beach inlet; right subplot: Scenario 2 and current bathymetry -after introducing Sluice Ditch; (b) Surface elevation, \u03b7 e for different morphology scenarios at the Money Marsh mudflat using the analytical model (in meters, from NAVD88 vertical reference level)."}, {"section_title": "Effect of channel hypsometry changes over time", "text": "Comparing the present-day conditions (i.e., deeper channels) with second scenario, we can see that the volume flux is more asymmetric and ebb dominant. The tide range has progressively increased from mean low water decrease at the upstream side of Leipsic River, and close to the Money marsh mudflat (Figure 2.14b where much less effect of asymmetry during neap tide conditions is observed. At the marsh interior tide gauges, Leatherberry and Dock (Figure 2.15b,c), we can see that the tide range has increased along the channel compared to the shallower bathymetry, and the increase again is coming from the asymmetric response where the mean low water increased more compared to the decrease in mean high water. Familkhalili and Talke (2016) and Ralston et al. (2019) have observed a similar scenario in Cape Fear River Estuary, NC and Hudson River Estuary respectively, where the channel deepening by dredging has increased the tidal range by decreasing the effective drag and increasing hydraulic conveyance. In addition, from the mid-channel velocity comparison shown in Figure 2.15b (blue line), we can see that the interior gauge Leatherberry shows a ebb dominant velocity skewness from the increased depth. It is not trivial to explain the observed changes at different locations using simple analytical models because of the rapidly varying channel thalweg bathymetry and three inlets internally connected to each other. The increased ebb dominance at the Leipsic inlet is coming from a combined affect of reduced friction and increased net transport from the interior channel Duck Creek (Figure 2.17a). Previously, for the shallower conditions (second scenario), the interior channel has a lesser influence from the Leipsic inlet side and the interior drained via the shorter route Sluice Ditch. Now, with a much higher channel depth and tidal wave speed, the low tide travels through the Leipsic River, has an increased draining of the marsh interior and ultimately shows an ebb skewness at the inlet. Also, the overall volume flux is higher for the present condition which travels faster during flood due to the reduced friction, and the draining speed is also higher at the beginning of the ebb.  where, h is the cross-sectionally averaged depth of channel; \u03b7 is the surface elevation; u is the cross-sectional average velocity; and C d is the drag coefficient. Scaling the tidal amplitude with \u03be, velocity with U , time with the tidal period T , x with a  In terms of these scaled variables, Equation 2.5.5 becomes The non-dimensional parameters S, I and R are given by where = \u03be/H and F is the Froude number U/ \u221a gH. From our chosen channel reach we have noticed that the tidal amplitude is 0.8m and 1.0m, and cross-sectionally averaged channel depth is \u223c 3.0m and \u223c 5.0m for the second scenario and the current bathymetry respectively. Using the characteristic scales in the Leipsic River: L = 16km, T \u223c 12.42hrs(\u223c 45000sec), C d = 3 \u00d7 10 \u22123 , and U \u223c 0.5m/s, we have observed that the local inertia S and the advective term I both are in same order. The ratio of tidal amplitude to the mean depth in all of the above terms (Equation 2.5.7-2.5.9) is seen to be two orders of magnitude larger than F 2 for both bathymetry conditions. From Table 2.2, we see that friction dominates inertia for both cases where R is an order of magnitude bigger than S and I. So, for the selected reach of the Leipsic River, the increase in mean low water can be simply explained using a balance between the sea surface gradient and channel friction as From Equation 2.5.10 we can see that for a higher depth and lower friction, the surface pressure gradient decreases along the channel, also observed in the surface comparison in (Figure 2.17b). While there is a reduced frictional effect for both second scenario and current bathymetry during high tide, it becomes dominant during ebb tide for the shallower conditions and increases the surface slope. Finally, the overall changes in the wetland hydrodynamics from the artificially opened channel and the progressive deepening can be also better understood if we look into Simon River inlet, which is mostly separated from the multi-inlet system (Figure 2.4) and is not a major factor in overall circulation of the disturbed part of BHNWR. From Figure 2.12 and 2.13, we can see that the channel volume flux is almost in a perfect symmetry during both spring and neap conditions, while the mid-channel velocity shows a tendency toward ebb dominance, and it stays unaffected from our scenario analysis as most of the channel reach has a bathymetry less than 5 m."}, {"section_title": "Potential of a new inlet opening from shoreline erosion", "text": "The net flux going in/out of the wetland seems to remain unchanged from the estimate with present morphology, with about the same degree of spring tide asymmetry.

Chapter 3 HYDRODYNAMIC MODELING OF A COMPLEX SALT MARSH SYSTEM: IMPORTANCE OF CHANNEL SHORELINE AND BATHYMETRIC RESOLUTION"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The stability and long-term sediment transport in a tidal wetland system largely depend on the channel flow characteristics and morphology. Sediment transport directly correlates with the surface elevation/velocity asymmetry, that can be in the form of magnitude and period of the tidal wave (Friedrichs and Aubrey, 1988;Nidzieko, 2010;Ralston et al., 2012). Having an accurate estimate of tidal asymmetry and relative phase difference between current and surface are essential for determining residual flow, direction and sediment budget. In a channelized wetland system, tidal distortion (duration asymmetry and/or velocity skewness) varies when wave travels from inlet mouth to the boundary due to interaction between non-linear terms in the continuity and momentum equations (Parker, 1984;Aubrey and Speer, 1985;Friedrichs and Aubrey, 1988). More specifically, the space and time varying channel cross-section area, advective acceleration and quadratic friction play a major role in the generation of overtides and higher harmonics. In an estuarine system with negligible river discharge, besides asymmetry, the relative phase difference between tidal velocity u and surface elevation \u03b7 can also vary both spatially and temporally due to system geometry, bottom friction and inter-tidal storage volume (Boon and Byrne, 1981;Friedrichs and Aubrey, 1988). The phase difference \u03c6 \u03b7u between surface elevation and velocity has historically been used to characterize the tidal oscillations in an estuary as standing waves, progressive waves, or a combination of both (Parker, 1984;Jay, 1991;Friedrichs, 2010). When \u03c6 \u03b7u = 90 \u2022 it represents a standing wave, \u03c6 \u03b7u = 0 \u2022 represents a progressive wave, and if the difference remains in between and close to 45 \u2022 , then it is called a mixed wave type estuary. In a non-convergent short estuary with dominant semi-diurnal tide and barrier at the upstream end, \u03c6 \u03b7u is a product of the interaction between incident and reflected waves (Hunt, 1964;Ippen, 1966;Officer, 1976). If the bottom friction is negligible, as in the case for a deep rectangular channel, it produces \u03c6 \u03b7u = 90 \u2022 and a standing wave type condition. For the same finite channel, wave properties can change in the presence of strong bottom friction, where the incident and reflected wave amplitudes decay and their phase lag follows the friction force (Hunt, 1964). Beside channel bottom friction, the channel hypsometry change based on the tidal surface elevation can also affect the amplitude decay and phase lag by enhancing or reducing the topographic dissipation (Li and Hodges, 2020). To properly identify the tidal wave characteristics and flow asymmetry inside a wetland system, we need a robust numerical modeling system that can resolve the variation in channel-marsh shoreline boundary and hypsometry with higher accuracy. 3.1.1 Background on modeling limitations in a marsh-channel system 3.1.1.1 Model grid resolution and the wetland flooding and draining All of the studies mentioned above have evaluated dominant physical processes for \u03c6 \u03b7u phase increase/decrease in channelized estuaries using simplified 1D wave or diffusion equations. These models have some common assumptions when dealing with the channel geometry, such as exponential channel width increase or decrease, depth is cross-section averaged, or the channel has a prismatic shape (Friedrichs, 2010). In a complex wetland system, to predict smaller scale processes, the along and acrosschannel bathymetry variations are key factors in determining time and space varying amplitude-velocity phase difference that a 1D model is not capable to resolve. To take care of the lateral and vertical channel variations, a 2D model is required with enough resolution to resolve the tidally varying hypsometry. However, developing an efficient high fidelity wetland/salt-marsh 2D model is a challenging task as it requires an understanding of the optimum grid resolution and more importantly availability of high resolution data sets of marsh topography and channel bathymetry (e.g., LiDAR). Each of them has limitations such as spatially variable biases due to the presence of vegetation and temporal variations due to seasonal or severe events changes. Until now, a large number of studies have been done to address estuarine/coastal circulation problems using structured curvilinear (Lesser et al., 2004;Chen et al., 2014), unstructured/triangular (Luettich Jr et al., 1992;Chen et al., 2008) and hybrid grids (Bomers et al., 2019) in finite difference, finite element or finite volume discretization frameworks. In complex wetlands where bathymetry and/or topography gradient is large, an unstructured grid offers better performance in terms of shape flexibility and computational efficiency (Dietrich et al., 2012;Symonds et al., 2017). Inside a wetland system, the model performance then depends on changes to grid resolution following the variation of topo-bathy gradient, which can affect marsh-channel draining and filling. Moreover, most of the numerical models, 2D depth averaged or 3D, applied on a complex shallow environment, use a minimum depth value that controls the moving wet/dry boundary and corresponding inundation extent. In the inter-tidal zones like wetlands, it is essential to have a highly accurate land-water interface line for estimating the volume of water that goes back and forth between channel and marsh surfaces. In such systems, major channels and tidal creeks normally have an elevated side-bank/berm close to the interface that separates both channel and marsh platform, and subsequently influences model wetting/drying and flooding/draining speed. Furthermore, increase or decrease of the channel resolution changes the channel hypsometry which directly affects the flow continuity and momentum. For these reasons, it is mandatory to properly resolve the land-water flow exchange and channel hypsometry with optimum spatial grid resolution in order to have accurate estimation of tidal amplitude, phase speed and asymmetry inside a wetland system. An optimum grid resolution would also avoid model slow down due to the total number of elements and CFL constraints, governed by the minimum grid size.\nCoastal salt marshes around the globe are dynamic landscapes that go through continuous erosion-accretion phenomenon. They provide an important buffer against storm surge, wind waves and even tsunamis, and can act as a natural protection system. However, massive degradation of several salt marsh environments has been observed over the last few decades. These changes are possibly due to various anthropogenic and natural processes such as sea level rise, man-made morphology changes, over grazing by native and migratory species, and severe meteorological events. Salt marsh stability depends on tidal range, elevation of the marsh platform, weather variability and vegetation biomass (Mariotti and Fagherazzi, 2010). Also, the competition between SLR and sediment accumulation can control the marsh elevation, thus the stability (Mudd et al., 2013). The overall system represents a complex dynamic that depends on the nonlinear interaction between biological and physical processes. The vegetation biomass growth rate depends particularly on tidal amplitude, period and local elevation, resulting in different vegetation species that dominates different zones (Morris, 2006). Hydrodynamic forces like tidal current and wind waves suspend sediment from the channel and mudflat, and then spread the suspended sediment over the marsh platform through overtopping channel berms and the narrow creeks. Marsh vegetation interacts with sediment dynamics and raises the elevation by trapping inorganic sediment, and incorporating direct organic decomposition. In recent decades, the field and numerical studies of salt marsh systems is an active matter of research because of continuous marsh loss. These studies have varied in terms of spatial scales, and solved long-term dynamics of the marsh boundary progradation or regression and platform evolution with time (e.g. Fagherazzi et al., 2012;Kirwan et al., 2016). Traditionally, in one-dimensional marsh transect, two-dimensional marsh platform, and large scale landscape models, the feedback between tidal elevation, vegetation dynamics, sediment transport and other climate variables (e.g., relative mean sea level (RMSL)) are taken into consideration to simulate wetland morphological processes (Fagherazzi et al., 2012). All the vegetative and sedimentary processes over the marsh platform are primarily modeled based on the local tidal range, the flow exchange between channel and marsh flats (i.e., wetting and drying), and the depth, duration and frequency of inundation. At present, the modeling of hydrodynamic processes in a salt marsh system is a challenging task, because of the complex topographic features such as rills and cuts through channel berms, small creeks on marsh platform and the variation in the scale of such elements. They are often missing in the model grid due to both incomplete resolution in data sources such as LiDAR, as well as the loss of resolution in the development of DEM's and model grids (Figure 4.1d, 4.3a,b). Many of these small scale topographic features may be hidden under dense vegetation canopies and are thus not easily recognized using even higher resolution techniques such as Structure from Motion (SfM). Inadequate representation of these features leads to the artificial hydraulic isolation of depressions in the marsh surface, leading to artificial ponding and resulting inaccuracies in predictions of the depth and duration of inundation (Deb et al., 2018a). Subsequently, this error can lead to the incorrect selection process of vegetation species, and of the volume and speed of flooding and draining processes, which ultimately contributes to the estimation of sedimentation rates and marsh platform geomorphological evolution. Besides the landscape evolution, this artificial storage of water can initiate other significant defects for the wetland modeling community. The flood/ebb dominance in a multi-inlet wetland system depends mainly on channel configuration and the inter-tidal volume storage. If the estuary width is much higher during high tide compared to low tide, the tidal wave propagates over the marsh surface slowly, and the system shows an ebb dominance overall. Model wetting/drying with significant ponding over marsh surface can alter the channel tidal asymmetry as the flood tide over marsh surface would propagate faster due to the reduced friction, changing the estuary width dramatically. Ultimately, it will provide an erroneous assessment of volume exchange, circulation, and net residual transport from the entire interconnected system. Moreover, this problem raises an issue also for the salt-marsh groundwater modeling community as the ponding can significantly increase surface-groundwater flow exchange, providing an artificial volume of water which in nature drains through the narrow channels on the marsh surface. Resolving microtopography (i.e., cuts through channel berms and depressions) in numerical simulation of flooding and draining processes is challenging in terms of both computational time and memory storage, even using the two-dimensional shallow water models. Inadequate representation of the ground irregularities can change the dynamic wetting and drying processes, causing discrepancies in the numerical model mass and momentum conservation. Although numerous techniques and strategies have been implemented over the years to improve tidal inundation over marsh surface in large-scale coastal models (e.g. Defina et al., 1994;Bates and Hervouet, 1999), the adequate treatment of the hydraulic isolation of depressions over marsh surface is still a matter of concern. Defina (2000) proposed a marsh porosity concept using modified shallow water equations, where 3-D equations are phase (area) averaged over an element and depth-integrated to provide a stochastic representation of the ground unevenness and microscopic flow. The subgrid model has improved the wetting and drying phenomena on a complex topographic environment with much less computational effort. Subsequently, D'Alpaos and Defina (2007) coupled a 1D channel model with the subgrid model to improve the flow through marshes in the Venice lagoon. The 1D linear elements representing narrow channels are placed on the 2D domain, and only the intermediate scale channels were solved, which are more prominent in length and size compared to the narrow cuts in BHNWR. While they have observed an improvement in subgrid model performance, there was no further analysis done on the marsh platform flooding and draining. Panday and Huyakorn (2004) and Jan et al. (2018) have proposed modified diffusion wave equations by incorporating the effects of microtopographic features (depression and obstructions) for areal overland flow simulations in integrated surface/subsurface inland watershed models. Both studies have considered a volumetric height in the governing equations to represent reduced storage volumes in isolated depressions, and a no-flow condition until the disconnected low points are filled with water. This strategy can be useful for hillslope overland flow simulations, whereas we need a different surface flow condition for the salt marshes where the depressions go through dynamic tidal flooding and draining due to the rills and cuts on the channel berms. King (2000) implemented a thin slot algorithm in the two-dimensional hydrodynamic finite element model RMA2, where flow is allowed to occur through a low porosity zone when water surface elevation goes below the marsh ground elevation. Although Nielsen and Apelt (2003) have tested the sensitivity of different marsh parameters and wet/dry conditions in RMA2, and Proudfoot et al. (2018) calibrated the model in a complex floodplain environment, the model capability in predicting marsh platform inundation is still not very well known. Also, the equivalent water depth term in the governing equations is assigned in a non-conservative form, which could lead to an inaccurate mass and momentum conservation over the marsh surface. In this study, we introduce a slot algorithm in the mass and momentum conservation equation to improve the representation of wetting and drying in artificially isolated depressions, using the Finite-Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM; Chen et al. (2013)) as a framework. We have followed the narrow slot or permeable-seabed technique used by Chen et al. (2000) and Kennedy et al. (2000) where the hydraulic depressions are considered as active fluid domain until the water surface elevation is below the lowest point of the depression/pond. Using narrow slots to represent flooding and draining through marsh depressions is justifiable, as, in reality, we can observe the rills and cuts distributed along channel berms all over the marsh platforms, shown in Figure 4.3. While our modeling strategy is conceptually similar to Chen et al. (2000) and Kennedy et al. (2000) where the time-varying slot cross-section area is taken into account using a conservative form, but differs in porosity calculations based on marsh slot height and tidal elevation, and a modified momentum equation. We made the modifications primarily to eliminate artificial ponding effects observed in hydrodynamic model simulations in any coastal salt marsh systems. We have verified our  "}, {"section_title": "Channel bathymetry data", "text": "Although a grid with enough resolution for resolving all the major processes is an important need, the model performance can be constrained by the scarcity of unbiased marsh topography and channel bathymetry data (Yu and Lane, 2006;Horritt et al., 2006). Recently, the emergence of different remote sensing techniques such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR; e.g., Horritt et al. (2006)) and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR; e.g., Horritt and Bates (2001)) have significantly improved the overland flood modeling, where the spatial resolution can reach up to 1 m with a vertical accuracy of \u00b115 cm on bare ground (Yu and Lane, 2006). However, these data sets have some major drawbacks that includes inability to map the channel bathymetry, only limited to dry areas and can have vegetation bias based on the data acquisition period (tidal stage and seasonality). While the vegetation bias in the LiDAR data can be treated via a number of techniques such as minimum bin technique (Schmid et al., 2011)), the proper representation of channel bathymetry is still a challenging task. To make seamless topo-bathymetric DEMs in wetlands, that include shallow turbid water bodies, the most popular and reliable technique is the use of an acoustic sonar system that can map the seafloor from single or multi-beam echo sounding (Dierssen and Theberge, 2014).

In a previous study of the same area, Stammerman (2013) measured a total of 48 cross sectional profiles on the major channels and 5 on the mudflats using hand-held sonar, and used linear interpolation of the bathymetry along channels in between the cross sections. The surveyed data points were referenced vertically to NAVD88 datum and interpolated to model NOAA-NGDC DEM for final model bathymetry of the area. For a large wetland like BHNWR, this channel survey data is not sufficient to properly represent along-channel cross sectional geometries. For the present study, a bathymetric survey of the main waterways in BHNWR was conducted using single-beam echosounder to obtain continuous depth with much higher density (McDowell, 2017). The survey consists measurement of depth and horizontal coordinates along cross sections, middle and sides of the channel profile and multiple zig-zag patterns (Figure 3.1b). The raw bathymetric soundings were processed, detided using nearest tide gauges, evaluated for outliers and then referenced to horizontal "}, {"section_title": "Unstructured grid", "text": "Two unstructured grids of varying element sizes are generated, with identical nodes coordinates inside the bay and different resolutions inside the wetland system to describe how a small change in grid resolution can significantly affect the overall tidal regime, and provide an ambiguous modeling solution. An unstructured grid covering the entire wetland with sufficient resolution for resolving tidal processes, was available from a previous hydrodynamic study of BHNWR (Stammerman, 2013). The model grid domain, shown in Figure 3. index.php) that applies forcing polygons or break lines to enforce the alignment of elements along the marsh-channel shoreline. The nodes on the forcing polygon were distributed manually based on the desired distance in specific areas, and the basic triangulation connected these nodes. The nodes on the tidal channels were pre-defined, and the mesh resolution transitioned from small elements in channels to bigger elements over the marsh surfaces, neglecting the steep channel side walls and berms ( Figure   3.3a.1). In a tidally varying environment, the unresolved channel berms can change the land-water interface and channel width dramatically, causing artificial channel convergence/divergence following low/high tide. To tackle this problem, the resolution of the existing grid of (Stammerman, 2013) was increased, mostly in the major channels, tidal creeks and land-water interface covering elevated berms (Figure 3.3b.1). The zero NAVD88 elevation contour is used to define the channel lateral boundaries, and the bathymetry gradient is then used to increase the resolution in channel areas with higher gradients. As a result, the interior channels, berms and channel shorelines have higher resolution compared to the marsh platform. The new grid has an element size as fine as \u223c 3 m around marsh-channel boundaries, and in total has 488207 nodes and 975931 elements (Figure 3.2b, 3.3b.1). Ultimately, using these two different resolutions and two channel bathymetry data sets, three unstructured grids are used for the analysis (Figure 3.3). They are unique in representing channel hypsometry based on the tidal elevation, where the main properties are: 1. Grid-A: lower channel resolution and insufficient channel survey, collected from Stammerman (2013) (Figure 3.3a) 2. Grid-B: higher channel and berm resolution, and bathymetry from Stammerman (2013) (Figure 3.3b) 3. Grid-C: higher channel and berm resolution, new dense channel survey data set (Figure 3.3c). The dramatic difference between sparse and dense bathymetric survey data set is shown in Figure 3.4a,b. In Figure 3.4b, we can see that there is a significant difference between cross section averaged depths estimated from different grids along the Leipsic River, which could bring errors to the overall model performance and tidal hydrodynamics."}, {"section_title": "Modeling background and boundary forcings", "text": "For this study, we use the Finite-Volume, primitive equation Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) developed by Chen et al. (2008), which is an unstructured grid model and widely used for resolving coastal scale processes both in 2D and 3D. The 2D model is driven with two different sets of boundary conditions: 1) Water level and depth average velocity fields from the large scale three-dimensional model of Delaware Bay: Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) (Kukulka et al., 2017)  qualitatively how a significant portion of the phase lag can be generated solely from the inaccurate channel hypsometry, and influence the overall tidal regime and velocity asymmetry. Both meteorological events Hurricane Sandy (2012) and Hurricane Joaquin (2015) used for model vs. in-situ comparison had threatened the Delaware Bay with storm surge and large-scale coastal flooding (Dohner et al., 2016). Hurricane Sandy made landfall on the New Jersey coast near Brigantine, NJ (Sullivan and Uccellini, 2013), and Hurricane Joaquin initially made landfall in the Bahamas and then changed track, finally moving north-northeastward over the Atlantic Ocean. Hurricane Joaquin stayed away from the US mainland and close to the shelf; however, significantly affected the the DE and Chesapeake bay area because of its gradually amplified surge generated for a longer period compared to Hurricane Sandy. ROMS large scale simulations for the entire Bay included the necessary forcings such as atmospheric forcing, tidal constituents and river discharge data from multiple sources, and were validated against NOAA tide gauges located in the Bay (Deb et al., 2020b). Then, after nesting ROMS data at the FVCOM boundary, four tide gauge data sets, located on wetland interior channels (Figure 3 Environmental Control (DNREC). After collection, all data sets were post-processed and converted to water surface elevation referenced to the NAVD88 datum. Among the channel tide gauges, \"Navigation light\" is located on the major channel/inlet mouth, \"Dock\" is close to the model upstream boundary, and two other gauges \"Leatherberry\" and \"Shearness\" are from inside the wetland & near a tidal mudflat, as shown in Figure   3.2c. For this study, a small portion of the entire channel tide gauge data are taken for model comparison that represents the major storm events: Hurricane Sandy and Hurricane Joaquin. More information about 2D model code, methods for prescribing tidal and subtidal boundary condition, validation and its limitations are given in Deb et al. (2020b). For the second part of the study, to simulate channel flooding and draining without marsh overtopping, the principal lunar semi-diurnal constituent M 2 amplitude and period are extracted from the nearest Bay tide gauge Ship John Shoal, NJ (https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/) using T TIDE, a tidal harmonic analysis tool (Pawlowicz et al., 2002). For different model runs, all the physical parameters such as drag coefficient, mixing coefficient and others are kept the same as cases in Deb et al. (2020b).  "}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "In this section, water surface elevations from model and in-situ data during the storm events are compared (Figure 3.5-3.6 and 3.7-3.8) to understand the role of proper channel resolution and hypsometry on accurate wetland flood modeling. The comparisons have been assessed in terms of model skill (Willmott, 1981) and average bias index (Equation 2.3.1-2.3.2), where a model skill of 1.0 shows perfect agreement and a positive/negative bias represents model over/under-prediction respectively. Here, more emphasis is given to the cases with Hurricane Joaquin (2015) where more field deployments, including current profiler data, are available.     We first examine the Grid-A case, which has lower resolution in the channels and sparse bathymetry data. For Hurricane Joaquin (Figures 3.5-3.6), model skill is relatively better close to the inlet opening (Navigation light) than the interior gauges (i.e. Dock). Overall, model skill remains close to 0.97, which indicates that Grid-A is a reliable option for further model analysis. However, before the entire marsh submergence during Hurricane Joaquin, there is a higher bias that originated from model under-prediction of surface elevation during low tide and the reduced tidal range along the channel as tide propagates inward from Navigation light to Dock (Figure 3.5). Then, when the major surge event inundates the marsh platform (Figure 3.5b), a better reproduction of channel flooding and draining is observed and subsequently higher skill at all the gauges is achieved. These differences actually display the role of marsh surface flooding and draining in overall model performance, where before the major surge we have an active model wet/dry domain, in contrast to the entirely wet domain with the residual surge. Interestingly, the same grid shows a better skill during calm conditions before Hurricane Sandy residual surge, and channel draining also seems to be accurate compared to the case of Hurricane Joaquin (Figures 3.7 and 3.8). Grid-B has an increased resolution in order to better resolve the land-water interface during tidal fluctuations; however, the channel bathymetry is interpolated from the DEM used to construct Grid-A. For the case of Grid-B, a drastic change in the scatter comparison is observed for both storm conditions, much more pronounced during Hurricane Joaquin. The model skill deteriorated faster inside the wetland upstream gauges (Figure 3.6, middle column) and the trend is significantly different from Grid-A. To understand this reduction in model skill with improved Grid-B resolution, time series plot during calm condition is shown in Figure 3.5, when the system still has active wetting/drying. It shows improvements in channel draining and tidal range prediction during low tide condition. The previous trend of under-prediction at the interior channel gauges has now changed to over-prediction with a significant increase in phase mismatches. These low tide over-prediction and sharper drops to the trough compared to in-situ ultimately deteriorated the model skill. The phase lag remains during elevated MWL when wet part of the domain expands (Figure 3.5b), slightly less pronounced during Hurricane Sandy (Figure 3.7-3.8). This case with Grid-B raises a new concern that with an improved marsh-channel resolution, why the system now shows a higher phase lag during ebb and if it is solely from the inaccurate surveyed channel hypsometry. A detailed explanation of the tidal phase speed discrepancy due to inaccurate channel bathymetry is given in the discussion section. For the case of Grid-C, with Grid-B resolution and more accurate topo-bathymetry, an immediate improvement in wave phase prediction, tidal range and channel draining/flooding are observed (Figure 3.6b, last column). Scatter comparison in Figure 3.5 show that the model skill and slope are close to 1.0 during the full period of Hurricane Joaquin, and also a similar response during Hurricane Sandy (Figure 3.7 and 3.8). Note that slightly inaccurate sub-tidal forcing at the boundary, originally came from the large scale model, has led to inaccurate sub-tidal signals in the entire domain, including the bay side gauges (Deb et al., 2018a). Finally, results using Grid-C show the importance of along and across channel bathymetry in resolving the hydrodynamics and tidal processes with higher accuracy.\n\nIn this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of the slot porosity approach in the isolated BHNWR marsh depression where HOBO pressure gauges were deployed along a transect from the channel berm into the marsh. The time series of water elevation at these gauges show the wetting and drying pattern and highlight the artificial ponding and phase lags in the regular FVCOM model simulations explained earlier in section 4.2. We have used the same storm condition (Hurricane Joaquin, 2015) described in Deb et al. (2020a), and ran the modified model for a similar period of 14 days matching the regular model simulations. In addition to the pressure gauges over the marsh surface, we also picked channel tide gauge locations inside the wetland ( It is essential to adjust the surface porosity based on local flooding and draining data collected from the marsh depression. From the HOBO pressure gauge DEM elevation, a depression elevation h 0 of 0.55m (NAVD88) is chosen to assign slots over that particular location (Figure 4.3 a-c). We performed multiple large scale model simulations by varying all the slot variables shown earlier in the idealized cases. From the combinations, we have observed that a \u03b4 = 0.0001 and Manning's n of 0.05 over the marsh slot shows a considerable improvement in model skill when compared to \u03b4 = 0.1 and Manning's n of 0.02, shown in Figure 4.12. Compared to the regular model ( Figure   4.2), we now observe a better draining at HOBO 3 to 6 during low tide. Water surface amplitude and phase in all of the gauges show a good agreement with the in-situ data, representing an improved flooding and draining on the entire depression. Among all the gauges, only at HOBO 6, it still shows the storage of water during both regular and storm period. This gauge is located on a real isolated pond inside the depression and the model elevation is below the selected h 0 value for the marsh surface. Our model has inaccurate elevation at that location from the DEM, and also the grid resolution is not high enough to resolve the small rill that drains it during the low tide. The scatter comparison for both regular and modified model at HOBO locations is shown in Figure   4.13. Also, the error statistics is given in Table 4.1, where the comparisons have been assessed in terms of model skill Willmott (1981), average bias index (Equation 2.3.1-2.3.2) and R 2 . A model skill of 1.0 shows perfect agreement, and a positive/negative bias represents model over/under-prediction. At HOBO 3-6, we can observe a noticeable improvement compared to HOBO 1 and 2, positioned close to the channel berm and drain properly, even in the regular model grid (Figure 4.3 and 4.2). Model skill increased at HOBO 3-5 located in the center of the depression. The regression coefficients and R 2 values also show a higher correlation between model with slots and in-situ compared to the traditional approach. The average bias index shows an essential contrast between the outcomes from the two model setups. The regular FVCOM model overestimates surface elevation during flood and completely misses phase, where the modified model slightly underestimates. Again, we can improve this underestimation further by properly tuning the model slot properties and drag coefficient. Both modeling approaches show similar statistics at Navigation light and Leatherberry tide gauges, located on the channels (Figure 4.14a). However, at Dock (the farthest upstream tide gauge), there is a notable discrepancy seen during Hurricane Joaquin for the regular model. This gauge is located on the main Leipsic channel and close to the HOBO pressure gauge location subjected to artificial ponding in model results. During 2015, both calm conditions and at the time of Hurricane Joaquin, the model predicts a faster falling tide and a slightly higher peak than the in-situ data. After implementing slots in the marsh depression, we noticed an immediate improvement in surface phase prediction at Dock, shown in Figure 4.14b. The amplitude now slightly decreases as some of the channel volume goes toward filling the slots during high tide.   "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In the results section, we have shown surface elevation comparison at different channel locations inside BHNWR wetland system during Hurricane Joaquin and Sandy for different grids, and how the model responds to the changes in channel hypsometry . We can see that the agreement between model and in-situ elevation varies based on different grid configurations. Our study area can be considered as a short estuary system, where the wetland basin length is close to 20 km and it is much shorter than the tidal wavelength 400 km for a semi-diurnal tidal period of 12.42 hours (Parker, 1984). Channels are mostly narrow (\u223c200 m), weakly-converging and deep at the middle (\u223c10 m); however, the cross-sectional area varies significantly over the entire reach due to shallow/deep side banks. In-situ tide gauge data sets have shown that the tidal amplitude decay rate is insignificant, while there is a noticeable lag in phase when wave travels upstream. In results section we have observed that the model performs well at gauge location close to the open bay (Navigation light) for all grids and storm events. However, when we looked into the marsh interior, in all our remaining gauge locations model predicts surface better during raising tide compared to the falling."}, {"section_title": "Role of marsh-channel connectivity and artificial ponding on model performance", "text": "Mainly, in Grid-A which has a lower resolution in channels, we can see that it under-predicts surface elevation during low tide, but then Grid-B with higher resolution over-predicts surface and misses phase completely (Figure 3.5-3.6, 3.7-3.8). Subsequently, model prediction improves immediately during both high and low tide when surveyed channel bathymetry interpolated into Grid-B, represented as Grid-C. In Grid-A with previously collected bathymetry and lower resolution, model suffers from inefficient marsh interior channel connectivity, along with a process called artificial ponding over the marsh platform (a modeling limitation from LiDAR and model grid resolution), ultimately leading to inaccurate drainage during low tide. Artificial ponding comes from the unresolved small marsh channels/creeks in model grid that in reality drains the isolated low spots in DEM depressions formed by channel berms. A detailed description of the ponding problem and the ongoing work has been provided in Deb et al. (2018a). For the scope of this paper, importance of artifical ponding is less significant compared to the grid resolution in marsh-channel berm locations and the need of proper channel survey data. During Hurricane Joaquin, the volume of water stored over marsh surface was significant due to a longer surge period. The land-water interface along the channels were not resolved properly in the low resolution grid and it took longer time to properly drain the stored water, as most of the wetland area remain active and wet. As a result, the ebb duration increased and the raising tide caught falling tide before reaching it's lowest limit in the channels. With improved resolution and properly defined channel berms in Grid-B, we observed an immediate improvement in the internal channel drainage pattern. The well resolved channel berms have helped to separate channels from marsh surfaces when water level dropped below model minimum depth (5 cm). Now, the surface elevation reaches close to in-situ elevation during low tide in the channels; however, it drains water faster than previous causing a phase lag between model and in-situ. An increase in resolution, while keeping old bathymetry in place have actually raised the channel volume flux and shifted it toward a frictionless estuary, explained further in the following section. Then, with new survey data in Grid-C, we found that the middle and cross-section averaged channel bottom is much rougher compared to previous conditions (Figure 3.4) and it improves the representation of shallower zones close to channel banks. This has changed spatially varying friction and helped to predict the phase better, shown in Figure 3.5-3.6. The response is almost similar for Hurricane Sandy except Grid-A with old bathymetry (Figure 3.7-3.8). In this case, interestingly, the model surface elevation matches better with in-situ during both high and low tide. To explain this we have to go back again to the channel connectivity issue mentioned before. For Hurricane Sandy there was no surge from the open ocean for couple of days prior to the landfall like Joaquin, and the marsh overland flooding became significant only during the period of storm. So, there was no accumulated affect from marsh wetting/drying on channel draining and filling."}, {"section_title": "Channel hypsometry and surface phase lag", "text": "From Figure 3.7.a we can see that, Grid-B has surface elevation phase lag at wetland interior gauges (Leipsic, Shearness & Dock), even when there was no subtidal elevation and ponding right before Hurricane Sandy. While, Grid-A that is developed with low resolution channel representation, shows a good surface elevation agreement with in-situ at the same interior gauges. In this section, we explain this phase lag without any artificial storage over marshes, and also describe how an inaccurate representation of channel configuration from collected data or model grid resolution can provide ambiguous results, that is in good agreement with the in-situ data. We ran new cases with only a regular M 2 tide that has an amplitude of 0.8 m and a period of 12.42 hr keeping the grid properties unchanged. Now, the responses shown in Figure   are completely from the channel properties (e.g. width, depth and friction). In, Figure   3.9 we have surface elevation comparison between at the two tide gauge locations along the main tidal channel Leipsic River: Navigation light (at the inlet mouth) and Dock (close to the boundary, 9 km upstream). First we have compared model surface elevation for Grid-A and observe that there is a clear phase lag between the gauges during both rising and falling conditions (Figure 3.9). When improved the resolution in channels and marsh surface for Grid-B, phase lag goes away and and the solution represents a standing wave condition. Ultimately, with the surveyed channel bathymetry in Grid-C, we see a reestablishment of the phase lag between downstream and upstream gauges, but much more pronounced during falling tide. The low resolution grid elements in Grid-A that represents channelmarsh boundary causes connectivity issue during low tide due to minimum depth criteria defined for wetting/drying. As surface drops below minimum depth, nodes that are located over marsh edge makes the entire element fall into dry category, ultimately making the channel width narrow than the real configuration shown in Figure 3.10a  we can see a much smooth transition between marsh and channel during high and low tides. In all of our previous surface elevation comparisons between model and in-situ shown in the results section, we have the highest bias for Grid-B compared to the other grids. In Figure 3.9 (second subplot) we can see that there are no changes in surface elevation phase, \u03c6 \u03b7\u03b7 for the entire channel reach and wave phase speed is a constant (c = \u221a gh) at both flood and ebb, mimicking a frictionless, non-convergent estuary with a barrier at the head (Van Rijn et al., 2010). Ultimately, using Grid-C with surveyed bathymetry and a proper representation of the channel geometry, we noticed an increase in surface elevation phase lag again at both inlet mouth and boundary, much more pronounced during ebb condition (Figure 3.9 (bottom subplot)). From Figure   3.10c and 3.11c we can see that the width become almost similar to Grid-B during a high tide, while the well defined shoals close to channel banks reduced cross-section averaged depth significantly. Lateral channel depth varies throughout the entire reach, and represents a channel geometry that has a deep channel at the middle and shallow side banks. In, Figure 3.9 (bottom subplot), we can see that as tide travels upstream, phase propagates faster corresponding to the narrower and deeper channel section at the mid-channel and slows down during ebb due to the reduced depth.   The along-channel surface phase lag for different hypsometry conditions can be also explained in a mechanistic way by using the Saint Venant equations widely used for one-dimensional discharge routing in open channels. According to Brunner and Bonner (2010), for a gradually varying unsteady flow with irregular cross sections, the equations can be written as: \u2202A \u2202t + \u2202Q \u2202x = 0 (3.4.1) where A is flow area of cross section (bH), Q is discharge (AU ), U is x-direction velocity, and z = z 0 + H; z 0 is channel elevation and H is the total depth. The friction slope S f using the Manning equation is where n is Manning's roughness coefficient and R is hydraulic radius, or cross-sectional area A divided by the wetted perimeter. We developed a 1D unsteady model for the entire Leipsic River (Figure 3 with the spatial change, and contribute to the overall transport. This rapid change in channel cross-section from low model resolution is not trivial to explain using a 1D case and needs subgrid representation of the partially wet elements in 2D calculations. In Grid-B, with higher marsh-channel shoreline resolution shown in Figure 3.10b and 3.14a.2, the spatial and time rate of change in channel width \u2202b \u2202x and \u2202b \u2202t reduces, and also, as we have kept the same bathymetry, the spatial change in channel depth \u2202h 0 \u2202x and bottom friction (Equation 3.4.3) remain similar to the values from Grid-A. From Figure   3.14c (top subplot), we can see that the surface phase lag has reduced as tide travels upstream and show a standing wave type condition, similar to the result shown earlier in Figure 3.9b using FVCOM. In Grid-C, the surveyed bathymetry data has altered the along and across-channel bottom roughness and flow area significantly compared to Grid-B. While, in this case, the rate of change in channel width is similar to Grid-B, the spatial change in channel depth \u2202h 0 \u2202x (Figure 3.14b.2), change in area \u2202A \u2202x and friction have become the dominant terms, ultimately reestablishing the phase lag between both gauges again (Figure 3.14c, bottom subplot).

We have estimated flux to take care of the channel geometry and across the channel velocity variation, and identified changes in relative phase \u03c6 \u03b7u and \u03c6 \u03b7Q ) to see the variation in tidal wave types. and \u03c6 \u03b7Q shows a complete reflection even at the inlet mouth, and they stay close to 90 \u2022 which displays characteristics of a standing wave. In this case, channel caused a very little damping of the incident and reflected wave due to weak convergence, higher depth and low roughness even during the low tide (Figure 3.10-3.12 (middle row)). From Figure 3.15 c-d, we can see that the velocity magnitude is similar to the previous case at the inlet mouth, and almost doubled at the boundary during ebb. Grid-B with improved resolution completely misrepresents the tidal phase speed and surfacevelocity/flux phase difference due to incorrect channel bathymetry data, ultimately reflected in our comparisons for Hurricane Sandy and Joaquin (Figure 3.5-3.6). Finally, in Grid-C with surveyed bathymetry , both \u03c6 \u03b7u and \u03c6 \u03b7Q show a different behavior than Grid-A and Grid-B, and the surface-velocity/flux phase lag seems to decrease with rising tide and wave regime represents a progressive type (Figure 3.15-3.16 ef). During ebb, the cross-section averaged depth decreases, bottom friction becomes dominant and slows the incident wave propagation further.   "}, {"section_title": "Concluding remarks and future works", "text": "We have presented an overview on how the accurate representation of wetland channel hypsometry can significantly improve the overall hydrodynamic modeling skill and reliability. Mainly, two important variables, model grid resolution around the marsh-channel shoreline and channel bathymetry are observed to define the model calculations for major physical processes. Inaccurate channel geometry from lower density survey and model resolution can provide good agreement with in-situ surface elevation data; however, completely misses the tidal velocity and phase. This better surface elevation and phase prediction are observed to result from the artificial channel convergence due to model low resolution around marsh edges. An increase in the grid resolution helped to identify the wet/dry boundary better, but has shown a dramatic decrease in the model skill because of the existing low density channel survey data that misrepresents the channel hypsometry and bottom friction. Finally, with a higher density channel survey inside the wetland, the model calculation of surface elevation has improved, along with the velocity magnitude and phase. Having an accurate estimate of the tidal velocity, and relative phase difference between current and surface are essential for determining asymmetry, wave regime and the residual flow. Ultimately, it contributes toward having a reliable hydrodynamic model, and further sediment transport calculations and net budget of the entire wetland system. This study has shown the role of channel hypsometry only, and kept the influence of marsh topography separate for a different study. The marsh topography is an important variable in controlling the platform wetting and drying, and the estuary width variation. However, due to the modeling limitation: artificial ponding in isolated marsh depressions, we have shown the importance of wetland channels here in controlling the tidal hydrodynamics.

The unstructured grid channel bathymetry data is collected during an extensive bathymetric survey, and the marsh topography is interpolated from the vegetation bias-corrected LiDAR DEM of the area. The model is driven by a large scale threedimensional model (Kukulka et al., 2017) based on the Coupled-Ocean-Atmospheric-Wave-Sediment Transport (COAWST) modeling framework (Warner et al., 2010) that provided current and surface elevations to the FVCOM model.

We defined z * in a similar way it is done in Kennedy et al.

Decomposing the velocity in the second term in 4.3.50 into an intrinsic phase-averaged velocity U/\u03b2 and a fluctuation velocity\u0169 defined according to \u03c6\u0169 = 0, we can rewrite it as The last term in Equation 4.3.51 represents the bottom stress \u03c4 bx . \u03c6\u0169\u0169 represents the momentum exchange due to vertical variation of the velocity field and can be lumped into t x (Defina, 2000).

Proudfoot et al. (2018) have shown the RMA2 model calibration in a similar way, where a higher Manning's n is assigned over marsh slots. Also, we have assigned a modified depth and, for a triangular cell ( Figure A), is given as"}, {"section_title": "Model evaluation using idealized cases", "text": "The model surface elevation map for the entire BHNWR, Figure 4.4, shows that the marsh platform has a widely varying scale for isolated hydraulic depressions in terms of area and depth. Most of the small depressions (length \u223c 10 -100 m) resulted from model grid connectivity issues and not real depressions. Then, there are real marsh depressions also identified from model surface elevation and stored volume, like the HOBO pressure gauge location shown in the Figure 4.3 a-c. In this model evaluation part, our goal is to determine whether the modified equations and the new wet/dry scheme can improve the overall hydrodynamics in well-formed idealized marsh depressions similar to a scale of the HOBO pressure gauge location."}, {"section_title": "Model setup and boundary forcing", "text": "We developed two idealized cases: A) A Bay-Marsh system, where a well defined marsh berm at the shoreline separates the land and water body, making an isolated depression over land during low tide (Figure 4.6 a-b), and B) A Bay-Marsh-Channel system, where a tidal channel separates the marsh platform into two similar isolated depressions (Figure 4.6 c-d). We assigned a similar berm property for both cases, where berm width = 50m, berm height = 0.8m and h 0 = 0.6m. We expect that, in reality, these idealized depressions would flood and drain through the narrow rills of similar scale observed in the HOBO pressure gauge location. Unstructured grids for idealized cases are developed using the Surface-water Modeling System (SMS) v13.0 (https://www.aquaveo.com/). We have designed the mesh in a way that it provides maximum resolution around the marsh-channel shoreline and berms where the slots Manning's n is given in the following section."}, {"section_title": "Case-A: Bay-Marsh system", "text": "We used four tide gauges at different locations to represent the changes in flooding and draining across the Bay-Marsh system shown in    From the comparison between different slot sizes, we can see that the total volume flux reduces following the shrinkage in slot width. The difference in volume flux will be higher if the slot height z * is higher based on the bottom elevation of the marsh depression. We have also estimated the tide-averaged volume flux and noticed that the residual value is less than 1% of the maximum flux magnitude for all cases, and the model conserves mass. Finally, to evaluate the dominant processes at the slot, we have estimated the momentum terms separately for a tide cycle shown in Figure   4.9. We chose \u03b4 = 0.001, \u03bb = 100, and a limited tide range to avoid marsh drying that generates numerical oscillation when the water surface is close to the bottom. The momentum balance shows that during both rising and falling tide, the pressure gradient at the marsh-Bay boundary is primarily balanced by bottom friction and all other terms are smaller when the surface stays in the slot range. It should be noted that, the balance can change when the tidal elevation is much higher than the slot height, and inertia can dominate instead of the bottom friction."}, {"section_title": "Case-B: Bay-Channel-Marsh system", "text": "After evaluating model mass conservation, we developed another scenario that includes a tidal channel separating the marsh, similar to the HOBO pressure gauge location (Figure 4.6 c-d). The aim of this test case to check the \"leaking\" process described by Nielsen and Apelt (2003) and Proudfoot et al. (2018) through the low porosity zone of the marsh elements when the water level fell inside the slot region. Both of these previous studies showed that a poor selection of marsh parameters in RMA2 model can result in a leakage of additional volume of water through elements that should be ideally impermeable. To take care of this problem, we have chosen a restricted range of elevation over the marsh surface that resolves the flooding and draining up to a lowest depression elevation h 0 , and not the entire rill depth observed in a marsh. In Figure 4.10a, first, we have provided the surface comparison again. The two gauges 1 and 2 located on the Bay and channel show an identical behavior for the different slot distributions. From the combination of marsh slots, and dynamic wetting and drying (i.e., element elimination), we can see that the channel surface elevation during low tide doesn't show any marsh leakage effect. The two other gauges 3 and 4 over the marsh platform illustrate the main effects of the slot properties. Gauge 4 is the farthest one from channel berm and shows a higher phase lag with a decrease in slot width and surface porosity compared to Gauge 3. We have used a smaller Manning's n value of 0.02 over marsh surface where no slots are implemented, and the phase delay is primarily from the area and drag changes in the slot. From this comparison, it is also evident that a narrow slot, in our case ranging from 0.1 to 0.001, slowly increases the hydro-period. Figure 4.10b illustrates the changes in flow velocity between Gauge 3 (close to the berm top) and Gauge 4 (depression bottom). As shown in the previous case, the maximum velocity magnitude during both flood and ebb remains same at the berm, and the ebb duration increases for a reduced slot width and lower porosity. When compared to the regular model (shown in red color) representing the physical channel berm, we can see that the peak magnitude during flood is almost similar for both models (Gauge 3) and can provide a reasonable estimate of the transport when surface overtop the berm. The difference between both models becomes prominent during the draining phase when the higher berm in the regular model disconnects the marsh interior from the channel and causes ponding.      Beside slot geometry, the bottom and wall roughness can also play an essential role in controlling flow propagation and affecting surface elevation and phase variation. Where slots are assigned, the sensitivity of pond filling and draining to bottom friction also needed to be taken into account. In FVCOM 2D equations, the friction force is defined by the depth-dependent drag coefficient C D , calculated using Manning's equation (Equation 4.3.11). In all our previous results, we have assumed a Manning's n in the range of 0.02 to 0.04 following the slot width contraction that represents higher roughness as the channel gets narrower. To examine the sensitivity of flow to both slot width/surface porosity and friction, we ran cases varying the Manning's n for the different slot sizes shown in Figure 4.11. We have gradually increased the Manning's n from 0.02 to 0.05, 0.03 to 0.06 and 0.04 to 0.07 for \u03b4 = 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001 respectively to represent the drag from various types of marsh vegetation available in coastal areas Loder et al. (2009). Manning's n outside the slot distribution site is kept to 0.02. For a higher slot width \u03b4 = 0.1, water drains faster from inside the depression for smaller n. While there is no considerable difference in surface phase during the flood, the increase in n and a smaller \u03b4 increases surface elevation phase lag, and retain more water inside the depression. In this test, we used the water level and depth averaged velocity fields from the large scale three-dimensional model directly nested at the unstructured grid boundary for a stormy condition, described earlier in section 4.2. Results are compared with the field data collected from the BHNWR at HOBO pressure gauge location. The large scale ROMS simulations for the entire Bay included necessary forcings such as atmospheric forcing, tidal constituents and river discharge data from multiple sources, and they were validated against NOAA tide gauges located in the Bay (Deb et al., 2018a). The unstructured grid used in this case is developed for the previous studies, chapter 2 and 3, and extensively validated using tide gauge and current profiler data sets collected from the wetland channels. For more details about the digital elevation model (DEM) development, tidal and subtidal boundary condition, in-situ data collection and post-processing, and the regular FVCOM model validation, the reader is referred to both chapter 2 and 3. Again, all the physical parameters such as the model minimum depth D min , mixing coefficient A m , and others are kept the same as cases mentioned in chapter 2."}, {"section_title": "Summary and discussion", "text": "In inter-tidal areas, traditional large-scale coastal models may suffer from artificial ponding due to the presence of artificially isolated depressions which store water over marsh platforms. It is a universal modeling problem that results from the missing model representation of rills and cuts through channel berms, due to insufficient horizontal grid resolution and underlying inaccuracies in the regional DEM. This error in model hydrodynamics can directly affect the prediction of the hydro-period, dynamic vegetation growth, the volume and speed of flooding and draining processes over the marsh surface. The deposition of fine sediments over the marsh surface varies based on the tidal properties, vegetation types and the available suspended sediment concentration (Kirwan and Murray, 2007). The higher sediment concentration near the channel bank is observed to decay exponentially depending on the water depth, horizontal flow velocity, and particle settling velocity as the distance increases (Christiansen et al., 2000). In recent studies, Fagherazzi et al. 2012 The channel berm porosity decreases following the slot contraction, and increases the surface phase lag inside the marsh. Slot height and width are defined in a way that it is narrower at the berm and then gradually reaches the unit width and area as the distance from berm increases. Subsequently, we have also looked into the changes in depth-averaged velocity that show an incremental increase in ebb duration from the slot width contraction and lower porosity at the berm. At the channel berm, the similarity in peak velocity magnitude during flood shows that the new equations can provide a reliable prediction of the velocity, which can give a better estimate of fine sediment transport if used with the corrected water depth. Changes to the slot bottom friction is incorporated by providing a higher Manning's n at the channel berms. We have observed that a narrow slot in combination with higher Manning's n, can affect the draining phase more compared to the flood. The slot roughness has been defined using a simple approximation of the Manning's n and the depth changes in the slot region, and would require further studies in the future to properly address the changes in slot hydraulic radius. After evaluating the model performance and sensitivity using idealized cases, we have used the same set of parameters in the realistic artificial ponding case in BHNWR. We assigned surface porosity on the channel berms that surrounded HOBO pressure gauges over the marsh platform. The new modeling strategy over the isolated depressions is observed to improve the marsh flooding and draining accuracy to a great extent compared to the traditional approach. However, to eliminate artificial ponding from the entire wetland, it is necessary to have a large network of pressure gauge deployed over all the profoundly affected areas, which will help to calibrate the marsh porosity. Chapter 5 SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORK"}, {"section_title": "Summary of presented work", "text": "This study consists of three chapters which described (1) sensitivity of tidal hydrodynamics to wetland morphology changes, (2) importance of channel shoreline and bathymetry resolution in improving the numerical model accuracy, and (3) removal of model artificial water storage over marsh platform by implementing a stochastic porosity distribution in the governing equations. The second chapter describes field data collection and a high-resolution unstructured grid 2D model setup and validation for simulating hydrodynamic processes in Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge, Delaware. An excellent model performance is observed compared to the in-situ point source observations in terms of water surface elevation and current velocity. The modeling framework is then used to assess the role of historical anthropogenic and natural morphological disturbances in changing the overall tidal dynamics. We have observed that an abrupt channel construction or inlet opening in a connected multi-inlet wetland system can significantly affect the system's natural balance. It can increase the natural frequency, decrease frictional dissipation, and ultimately lead to an ebb dominant condition that increases channel erosion. The numerical model results are also explained using simple scaling analysis and the first-order balance of the governing hydrodynamic forces. In the third chapter we have demonstrated that poor grid resolution around marsh-channel berms creates artificial channel convergence and inaccurate tidal wave characteristics. The inaccurate channel bathymety and inadequate resolution might provide an acceptable model of surface elevation when compared to in-situ data but, at the same time, completely misrepresent the velocity field. This model inaccuracy can lead to faulty estimates of other important processes such as net circulation and sediment transport. The study has shown that a high-resolution marsh-channel boundary in combination with a dense bathymetry survey can dramatically improve the configuration of tidally varying channel hypsometry and increase numerical model reliability. We recommend to always compare both the model surface elevation and velocity field when developing a modeling framework for complex salt-marsh environments. Furthermore, in chapter four we have observed that the models predictions of overland flow and sediment transport onto tidal marsh platforms can be affected by the effect of artificial ponding, or the retention of ponded water in low areas of the platform. These areas would drain in the real world, providing a greater potential volume for water transport onto the platform during flooding, but small topographic features that make drainage possible are represented poorly or not at all in a coarse model grids, data sets used to build DEM's for model grids, or both. We have treated this problem by adding an effective porosity to the marsh surface over a restricted range of elevations, and tested the modified governing equations in an application to the wetland system within the Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge, Delaware."}, {"section_title": "Future work", "text": "The results of the study have emphasized the need for further work before the model could be used to assess long-term sedimentation problems and geomorphology evolution. \u2022 With the present explicit scheme and wetting/drying algorithm, the model is observed to produce unrealistic velocities near steep marsh-channel boundaries due to the rapid drawdown between control volumes during the ebb tide. This artificially generated volume is not significant compared to the total tidal volume flux transported in and out of the wetland; however, it can affect the net circulation estimates from the entire system based on the total inundated area, model computational time step, and the minimum depth. A better treatment of the pressure gradient term at the steep wet/dry boundary might further improve the model accuracy. \u2022 We have observed the 3D model instability when assigned more than three sigma vertical layers for the entire model domain because of the extreme shallow conditions over the marsh surface. An improved 2D-3D coupled modeling framework is needed in the future, where the model will resolve the higher resolution vertical layers in the channel, and only the depth-averaged quantities on the marsh surface. \u2022 A large network of pressure gauges is required over the properly identified hydrualic depressions to calibrate spatially varying slot parameters, and eliminate artificial ponding from the entire wetland. \u2022 The sensitivity of the porosity distribution and marsh platform flooding/draining to different unstructured grid resolution also need to be tested for prescribing the optimum model resolution."}]
