The 2011-2012 NCES, Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), cited in (NCES, 2016) , concluded 40.7% of elementary through high school teachers (K-12-grades) indicated student behavior interfered teaching and learning, and 32% of Kansas teachers reported the same. The National Teacher and Principal Survey (NTPS) 2015-2016 report, which grew out of the Schools and Staffing Survey (NCES, 2018) , found elementary through high school public teachers across the nation reported an even higher percentage (43%) of student misbehavior affecting their teaching (NCES, 2018) .\nAccording to Plumb, Bush, and Kersevich (2016) , the frequency of student misbehavior in the classroom indicates substantial gaps in student social and emotional ability. At any time, at least two-thirds of America's public school students are subject to the adverse effects of complex and chronic childhood trauma now resulting in gaps within social and emotional competencies. Chronic trauma can manifest in the form of aggression, student misbehavior, poor attendance, and learning difficulties as the brain works to be in constant survival mode as a coping mechanism (Plumb et al., 2016) . Today, more than any other time in history, teachers must recognize and understand how trauma affects the social, emotional, and academic skills of students (Terrasi & Crain de Galarce, 2017) . With this expectation comes the requirement for educators to teach prosocial skills, social and emotional competence, and to build resilience in all students (Plumb et al., 2016) . Children who have competent social and emotional skills are better able to manage emotions and behavior.\nLearning these skills at an early age equips students to communicate appropriately and form healthy relationships (Committee for Children, 2011).\nThe national education policy, updated in 2015, with the passage of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), influences classroom management through grants for implementing three-year training cycles of positive behavior interventions and supports to faculty and staff (Plumb et al., 2016) .\nProfessional organizations collaborate with the federal government to conduct research on socialemotional learning. With the inception of federal mandates and new state standards, schools are implementing programs designed to improve student behavior, and incorporate social-emotional learning to improve school climate, school achievement, and student life outcomes (Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning, 2018) .\nhttp: //dx.doi.org/10.15405/ejsbs.245 eISSN: 2301 -2218 "}, {"section_title": "responsibility of the Editors", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "2791", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Problem Statement", "text": "Researchers conclude social-emotional learning programs implemented with fidelity, reveal positive effects on problematic and aggressive behaviors, and student attitudinal changes such as school connectedness and improved school/classroom climate. There remains a need for students with severe or complex social-emotional or behavioral difficulties to receive interventions beyond what Second Step can provide (Low, Cook, Smolkowski, & Buntain-Ricklefs., 2015) . Efficacy studies of the Second Step curriculum support a positive impact to the social-emotional and executive functioning skills of children, especially those who are initially behind or disadvantaged in these areas (Top, Liew, & Luo, 2016) ."}, {"section_title": "Review of Literature", "text": "Providing quality education necessitates that school administrators' first priority is to be judicious in operating safe and orderly schools. This ominous responsibility demands discipline designed to stop misbehavior and change it into acceptable conduct. Traditional reactive punitive discipline, such as suspension and expulsion works only at a band-aide level, temporarily stopping misbehavior at best; particularly at the high school level (Flannery, Fenning, Kato, & McIntosh, 2014; Losen & Martinez, 2013) . These approaches adversely affect academic skills (Morrissey, Bohanon, & Fenning, 2010) , school connectedness, dropout rate, and school climate (Flannery et al., 2014) . Losen and Martinez (2013) estimate one of every nine secondary students received one suspension during the 2009-2010 school year. The majority of those suspensions were for minor school rule infractions rather than serious or criminal offenses. Punitive discipline can trigger backlash from students, making behavior worse. Schools need to administer proactive, not reactive discipline (Morrissey et al., 2010) . Proactive programs that promote healthy, productive, and safe learning environments show increases in graduation rates, achievement scores, and life outcomes (Losen & Martinez, 2013) . One research-based approach that proactively addresses student behavior is the Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) model"}, {"section_title": "Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports", "text": "Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) is an evidence-based practices and organizational systems disciplinary approach that encourages and rewards positive behavior to shape student behavior (U.S. Department of Education, 2014) and increase social competence (Flannery, Frank, Kato, Doren, & Fenning, 2013; Horner et al., 2009) . The goal of PBIS is to establish social culture and behavioral modifications and supports necessary to improve social and academic behavior and success of all students (Flannery et al., 2013) . School-wide PBIS implementation establishes predictable, efficient, safe, and effective school climates for students (Flannery et al., 2014) . Decreases in high school dropout rates are reported among student outcomes (Ecker-Lyster & Niileksela, 2016) , as are improvements in student behavioral and attendance outcomes (Freeman et al., 2016) . Schools having implemented school-wide PBIS report decreases in student office disciplinary referrals (Horner et al., 2009; Morrissey et al., 2010 & Romero, 2015 .\nAccording to Flannery et al. (2013) , school wide PBIS implementation is not a \"packaged program but...a structured framework that a school team uses to guide the adoption of practices\" (p.\n268), consisting of three tiers of behavioral supports. Tier 1 includes universal supports for all students and staff across academic settings designed to support 80% of all students successfully.\nTier 2 supports are targeted, small group supports that address needs within subgroups of students needing additional interventions beyond Tier I. It accounts for nearly 15% of a school's FTE (Flannery et al., 2013; Freeman et al., 2016) . Targeted supports can include social skills improvement, behavior management, attendance, dropout prevention, or study skills. Tier 3 behavioral interventions are the most time-intensive, inclusive of individualized supports as needed, and accounts for the top 5% of students with significant behavioral problems not efficiently addressed through Tier 1 and 2 interventions. Tier 3 interventions can include personalized behavior plans or wraparound supports to reduce or eliminate adverse student behavior (Flannery et al, 2013; Freeman et al., 2016) .\nCore components of successful PBIS implementation consist of four critical practices. They are identification of school-wide outcomes or expectations of student learning and behavior; development of organizational practices and consistent procedures to support the implementation of PBIS; explicit teaching of expectations and application of evidence-based systems to create a positive learning environment and social climate, and data collection to monitor progress of interventions (Flannery et al., 2013; Morrissey et al., 2010) .\nElementary and middle schools report that PBIS is an effective framework in improving school climate and student behavior (Morrissey et al., 2010) . Longitudinal studies document decreased office disciplinary referrals (ODRs) (Flannery et al., 2013 & Flannery et al., 2014 ) and significant reduction in student suspensions and office disciplinary referrals over a five-years of PBIS implementation with high fidelity identified as the outcome (Bradshaw et al., 2010 (Flannery et al., 2013) ."}, {"section_title": "Social-Emotional Learning and the Second Step Curriculum", "text": "The randomized, controlled effectiveness trial conducted by Bradshaw et al. (2010) concluded that in addition to PBIS, schools that implemented additional student support programs reported the greatest success. These programs focused on character education, bullying prevention, drug prevention, social skills, and social-emotional learning/development. Social-emotional learning programs promote a safe and supportive school climate by attempting to decrease problem behaviors while increasing prosocial behaviors (Top, Liew, & Luo, 2016) . The Second Step SocialEmotional Learning Curriculum is a research-supported, universal social-emotional learning program for Pre-K-8 th grade. It explicitly incorporates classroom-based instruction and activities that address social-emotional (SE) and executive functioning (EF) skills, including but not limited to emotion knowledge and regulation, empathy, perspective taking, and social problem skills (Upshur, Heyman, & Wenz-Gross, 2017) . These skills develop dramatically between the ages of 3\u00bd to 7. Healthy social-emotional and executive functioning skills, have been linked to early school readiness and adjustment (Upshur et al., 2017) , and student success (Top et al., 2016) .\nClassroom interventions and parental involvement during early childhood helps to develop socialemotional and executive functioning skills, and improve emotion regulation (Upshur et al., 2017) .\nThe 20-year Second\nStep program is one of the most widely used social-emotional learning programs, with the 4 th edition addressing executive functioning and self-regulation skills (Low, Cook, Smolkowski, & Buntain-Ricklefs, 2015) . Designed to increase children's school success and decrease problem behaviors, PreK-5 th grade curriculum promotes social-emotional competence and self-regulation skills (Second Step, 2011) . The middle school curriculum equips students with the appropriate skills, knowledge, and mindset necessary for handling strong emotions, understanding and connecting with peers, avoiding and resolving conflicts, and promoting academic achievement (Second Step, 2017) . The social-emotional learning grows school success, school connectedness, positive-respectful school climate and decreases problem behaviors, peer rejection, impulsivity, antisocial behavior, and low academic achievement (Second Step, 2011; Second Step, 2017 ).\nAn established body of research assesses the efficacy of Social-emotional learning showing significant increases in both social and emotional knowledge and behavioral and emotional risk following Second\nStep implementation in a moderate PreK-4 th grade samples (Brown, Jimerson, Dowdy, Gonzalez, & Stewart, 2012) .

They found that those exposed to stressful or adverse childhood experiences have limited opportunities to learn and practice the executive functioning skills essential to positive classroom behavior. Unsafe home environments or lack of learning or parenting resources necessary to develop executive functioning or social-emotional skills help to explain this outcome. Significant improvements in executive functioning (EF), including attention, engagement, think time/inhibition control, and social-emotional (SE) skills (primarily with calming down) were found in those preschool children who received instruction through Second\nStep. Children from disadvantaged environments (low SES, single-parent homes, stressful home situations) entered preschool significantly behind their peers in social-emotional and executive functioning skills, because negative environments prevent practice with behavioral regulation (Upshur et al., 2017) . Top et al. (2016) examined the effects of the at the Second Step curriculum at the upper elementary and middle school levels. Consistent with the Upshur et al. (2017) and Low et al. (2015) study, Top et al. (2016) found students who progressed through the social-emotional curriculum in later elementary and middle school grades exhibited fewer problem behaviors and higher grades.\nMore prosocial behaviors (i.e. cooperation, sharing, and helping others) were observed in the treatment group, although not significant.
