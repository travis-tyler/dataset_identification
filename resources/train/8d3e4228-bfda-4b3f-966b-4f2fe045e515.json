See Fecso et al. (1986) , Vogel (1995) , and Nusser and House (2009) for the evolution and development of agricultural statistics and the surveys conducted at the United States Department of Agriculture. The June Agricultural Survey (JAS) is conducted annually. For the JAS, a stratified random sample is drawn using an area frame, which ensures complete coverage. Information about US crops, livestock, grain storage capacity, type and size of farms are collected from agricultural operations in the sample. NASS uses the JAS to estimate numerous items relating to US agriculture, including the number of farms.\nEvery five years, the annual number of farms estimate is compared to the one obtained from the quinquennial Census of Agriculture, which is a dual-frame survey conducted during years ending in 2 and 7. See Kott and Vogel (1995) for details on the dual-frame survey. In 2007, the difference between the estimated number of farms from the JAS and the 2007 Census of Agriculture could not be attributed to sampling error alone. A preliminary study showed that the JAS estimate was biased because some farms were incorrectly classified as non-farms. In addition, some non-farms were misclassified as farms, but at a lower rate. Prior to this study, NASS had assumed that no misclassification was present in the JAS or any other survey that it conducted. Bross (1954) first showed that, when misclassification is present, conventional methods can be seriously biased. Tenenbein (1970 Tenenbein ( , 1972 proposed a double-sampling scheme for inference from categorical data subject to misclassification. The double-sampling schemes utilize a sample of n 1 units classified by both a fallible and true device, and another sample of n 2 units classified only by a fallible device. The double-sampling scheme and its variants are popular approaches to estimation when misclassification is present (see Thall et al. 1996 , Stewart et al. 1998 , and the references therein). Bayesian methods are also popular for inference from categorical data subject to misclassification (see Swartz et al. 2004 , the book by Gustafson 2003 , and the references therein).\nIn this article, a design-based approach that addresses misclassification and leads to improved estimates of the number of farms is suggested. First, the JAS sampling design is discussed, with an emphasis on the factors leading to the misclassification of farms and non-farms. Then, a proposed revision to the JAS sampling design is presented, and the properties of the resulting farm number estimates from this revised design are explored. Finally, the implications of the work on the JAS are considered."}, {"section_title": "The June Agricultural Survey (JAS)", "text": "The JAS is conducted annually utilizing an area frame, ensuring complete coverage of the population. Land within the JAS area frame is divided into homogeneous land-use strata. Although minor definitional adjustments may be made depending on the specific needs of the state, land-use strata with more than 50% cultivated land are generally labeled with a value in the 10s, agri-urban and commercial land-use strata are typically given a label in the 30s, and so on (see Table 1 ). The general land-use strata definitions are similar from state to state; however, minor definitional adjustments may be made depending on the specific needs of a state. Each land-use stratum is further divided into substrata (called \"design strata\") by grouping areas that are agriculturally similar, providing greater Land-use strata $ 50% cultivated land 10s 15 -49% cultivated land 20s , 15% cultivated land 40s Agri-urban/Commercial areas 30s Non-agricultural land 50s precision for state-level estimates of individual commodities. Within each design stratum, the land is divided into primary sampling units (PSUs). A sample of PSUs is selected and smaller, similar-sized segments (each of about a square mile (640 acres)) of land are delineated within these selected PSUs. Finally, one segmentis randomly selected from each selected PSU to be fully enumerated.\nOnce selected for inclusion in the JAS, a segment stays in the sample for five years. Thus, each year the sample has about 20% new segments, and the 20% of the segments that have been in the sample for five years rotate out. Segments rotating in during the same year are called replicates; thus, each JAS sample consists of five replicates (see Cotter et al. 2010 , Benedetti et al. 2015 , for further details on JAS).\nThrough 2010, the JAS prescreening was conducted in the two weeks prior to data collection. During prescreening, field enumerators (data collectors) divide each segment into tracts of land. Each tract represents a unique land operating arrangement. Field enumerators do not interview tract operators during prescreening. Instead, they complete an area screening form which provides an inventory of all tracts within a sampled segment, and contains screening questions that determine whether or not each tract has agricultural activity. Using this form, each tract within the segment is screened for agricultural activity, and the screening applies to all land in the identified operating arrangement. Each screened tract is classified as agricultural or non-agricultural. Non-agricultural tracts are assigned to one of three categories: (1) non-agricultural with potential, (2) non-agricultural with unknown potential, or (3) non-agricultural with no potential.\nThe JAS is conducted during the first two weeks of June. During the sampling period, field enumerators return to only those tracts classified as agricultural during the earlier screening period. Data collection continues until some type of response is obtained for every sampled tract. If a respondent cannot be reached, the information may be obtained from administrative data, data collected for other surveys, or estimates made by field enumerators. Regardless of the information source, these tracts are identified as being field estimated. Based on the JAS, an agricultural tract is classified as a farm if its entire operation, which could include land outside the sampled tract, qualifies with at least USD 1,000 in agricultural sales or potential sales. All nonagricultural tracts and agricultural tracts with less than USD 1,000 in sales are classified as non-farms.\nIn 2009, NASS conducted a one-time follow-on survey to the JAS segments, the Farm Numbers Research Project (FNRP) (Abreu et al. 2010) . The sampling design of the FNRP targeted the 20% of JAS segments that were newly rotated in for 2009 (2009 segments). All tracts in the 2009 segments that were non-agricultural or field estimated in JAS were selected for FNRP. During the FNRP, all places of interest within a selected tract were considered subtracts.\nA shortened form based on the JAS questionnaire was used to classify each subtract as a farm or as a non-farm.\nA major finding in FNRP was that, assuming misclassification rates are the same for all rotations (did not differ from that observed for the 2009 segments), the JAS estimate of the number of farms would increase by approximately 580,000 (see Table 2 ). The bulk of these farms were found in tracts that had been identified as non-agricultural with no potential in the JAS.\nSeveral factors could lead to the misclassification of farms as non-farms and of nonfarms as farms. During prescreening, the agricultural activity may not have been evident when the field enumerator observed the tract from a distance (tract operators are not interviewed during this process), or the primary agricultural activity could have been outside the sampled tract (the response for a tract includes agriculture associated with all of the operation, not just that within the tract). In FNRP, 86.1% (500,338) of the fieldestimated number of farms misclassified as non-farms were found in tracts prescreened to be non-agricultural with no potential. Small farms are more likely to be misclassified. In FNRP, 58.3% (335,902) of the field-estimated number of farms misclassified as non-farms had less than 25 acres. Operations that recently went out of business or small farms whose production fell below the USD 1000 threshold in sales could be misclassified as farms when field estimated.\nTo obtain a more accurate estimate of the number of US farms from the JAS, the current estimation approach must be revised to account for misclassification. The Annual Land Utilization Survey (ALUS), a follow-on survey to the JAS, has been proposed for this purpose. FNRP results are used as guidelines for the ALUS design, but ALUS will be able to detect different types of trends as well."}, {"section_title": "The Annual Land Utilization Survey (ALUS): Design", "text": "The ALUS focuses on those JAS tracts that were potentially misclassified as farm or nonfarms either during the prescreening process or during field estimation of farm status for nonresponding or inaccessible operations. These tracts are treated as nonresponders, and data collection is focused on obtaining accurate information on them. ALUS represents the second phase of a two-phase sample, with the first phase being the traditional JAS. As in the JAS, the proposed ALUS is a stratified sample of segments, using JAS land-use strata and sampling across rotations. Segments that are eligible for inclusion in ALUS must have at least one tract that was prescreened as non-agricultural (regardless of potential) or that was field estimated in JAS (as either a farm or non-farm); that is, only JAS segments that had completed interviews for all tracts are not eligible for possible inclusion in the ALUS sample. For a selected segment, all tracts are to be reevaluated using a modified combined JAS-ALUS questionnaire. The collection of eligible segments in a particular year will be called the ALUS population. For ALUS, the sample allocation of segments to each state-stratum combination considers two factors: the proportion of the ALUS population in the land-use stratum and the proportion of the FNRP adjustment from non-agricultural tracts in the land-use stratum (see Table 3 ). The latter simultaneously accounts for the number of converted non-agricultural tracts and the expansion factors associated with them, allowing states and land-use strata that contributed most to the FNRP adjustment to be targeted. In the JAS, the sampling scheme favors cultivated areas. For ALUS, the sampling will lean more heavily on moderately and less cultivated land-use strata where the largest portion of the FNRP adjustment originates. For example, although the exact land-use stratum definition varies from state to state, land-use strata 10s \u00f010; 11; \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u00de are highly cultivated areas, with generally at least 50% cultivated land. In the JAS, over half of the selected segments are from these land-use strata. However, 10s made uponly 16% of the FNRP adjustment arising from non-agricultural tracts, so only about 27% of the ALUS sample will come from these strata. The sample will be evenly distributed over the five rotations, with approximately 20% of the ALUS sample selected from each.\nWithin each land-use stratum of the ALUS population, segments will be selected with probability proportional to size (pps) sampling where the size measure of a segment is defined as the sum of the number of tracts either prescreened as non-agricultural or field estimated to be non-farms, and one-tenth of the number of tracts field estimated to be a farm. Because most tracts (92%) field estimated as farms in the JAS were confirmed as farms in FNRP, ALUS only takes a tenth of the number of these tracts within a segment when determining size. If a segment is selected, all ALUS-eligible tracts withinthat segment will be in the sample, including those field estimated as farms.\nPrecise estimates of uncertainty can be obtained by viewing the combination of JAS and ALUS as a two-phase sample, with JAS being the first phase and ALUS being the second. Given that each phase makes use of a probability sampling design with known inclusion probabilities, standard results can be used to construct a design-based estimator (S\u00e4rndal and Swensson 1987) . However, nonresponse is also expected to occur in ALUS.\nInstead of using the estimated tract values to account for this nonresponse, the twophase design estimator of S\u00e4rndal and Swensson (1987) has been extended to a third phase (see Section 4). The resulting estimator is used for the two-phase JAS-ALUS, with the self-selection of response treated as a third phase of random sampling. This methodology can be applied not only to estimates of the number of farms but to all variables collected in the ALUS.

However, the JAS estimate is biased because some tracts are misclassified either during prescreening when agricultural tracts may be identified as non-agricultural, or during the JAS when tracts are incorrectly field estimated to be farms or non-farms. Now consider the JAS-ALUS two-phase estimator with nonresponse adjustment for the second phase. The estimator i\u015d\nHere, the first termT 1 has the same form asT in (3). However, it only includes the JAS segments comprised of all farm tracts confirmed through an interview with the operator (not estimated) in the first phase. In the second phase, the ALUS sample only includes the JAS tracts that were either prescreened as non-agricultural or field estimated as either a farm or a non-farm. Thus each tract in the ALUS sample has been potentially misclassified and is treated as a nonrespondent from the first phase. n 0 ij is the number of ALUS segments in design stratum j within land-use stratum i. a ij is the expansion factor or the inverse of the probability of selection in the second phase for each segment in design stratum j in landuse stratum i. z ijk is the number of farm tracts in the given ALUS-selected segment. r ijk is the expansion factor or the inverse of the response probability of each tract in segment k, design stratum j, land-use stratum i.\nHere we assume that all tracts in the same segment have the same response probability and this probability r ijk is known. If r ijk is unknown, it can be estimated by modeling under the assumption of stratified Bernoulli subsampling for nonresponse, that is, a response is assumed to have the Bernoulli distribution. In this case, we would have another variance component. This is a complex case and is not considered here. A referee suggested that, instead of assuming r ijk known, the last phase could be treated conditionally (on the number of good responses) as a simple random sample within each segment. The assumption needed for this approach is for at least two responses to be obtained within each segment. Readers are referred to S\u00e4rndal et al. (1992) for the modeling on nonresponse in a quasi-design-based framework (\"quasi\" because response if modeled). Hidiroglou and Estevao (2013) used a follow-up sample of the nonrespondents to deal with nonresponse. Now we apply (2) in Theorem 1 to obtain a design-unbiased estimator of Var\u00f0T 2 \u00de. For convenience, we use (i, j ) to denote design stratum j within land-use stratum i. We also use k or p to be the index of segment. In the JAS-ALUS sampling design, the unit is a segment. One unit is one segment in (i, j ). It includes all tracts in that segment. Recall that all segments within the same design stratum have the same expansion factor.

Its results are used to develop a number of official estimates. Here, the focus has been on estimating the total number of US farms. The substantial misclassification of farms and non-farms has led to a biased estimate of the number of farms. The two-phase JAS-ALUS has been suggested as an improvement that would produce a (quasi-)unbiased estimation of farm numbers. The proposed three-phase survey design-based estimator (1) is an extension of the two-phase sampling estimator in S\u00e4rndal and Swensson (1987) , which allows for a general sampling design in each phase. For the JAS-ALUS application considered here, the JAS is the first phase; ALUS is the second phase; and modeling response/nonresponse in the second phase is the final phase. More importantly, a design-unbiased variance estimator for estimator (1) is given in Theorem 1. The estimator (10) of Var\u00f0T 2 \u00de was developed by applying our threephase variance estimator (2).\nAlthough the focus here has been on estimating the number of US farms, the same ALUS follow-on and adjustment for nonresponse in the second phase allow unbiased estimates of other variables to also be obtained. The experience gained from the FNRP described in Section 2, the change in JAS protocols following the FNRP, and the fact that the FNRP included only 2009 segments could lead to the ALUS results being different from those anticipated here. ALUS has been proposed during a time of declining budgets, and its additional expense is the primary reason NASS has yet to implement ALUS.\nFollowing the FNRP, additional training on JAS prescreening was conducted, and the time that field enumerators were given to complete prescreening was extended from two to four weeks. This resulted in an initial increase in the estimated number of farms, using Equation 1, and then the estimates began to decrease. Some of the decrease may be due to a decline in the number of farms; however, misclassification may again be increasing. Currently, NASS is using modeling approaches to adjust for this misclassification in JAS.
