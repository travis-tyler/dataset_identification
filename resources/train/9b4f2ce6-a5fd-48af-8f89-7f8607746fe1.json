The following sequences were acquired: (Ashburner, 2007) . Briefly, (i) T1-weighted images were segmented to produce GM, white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tissue probability maps in the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space; (ii) the segmentation parameters obtained from the step (i) were imported in DARTEL; (iii) the rigidly aligned version of the images previously segmented (i) was generated; (iv) the DARTEL template was created and the obtained flow fields were applied to the modulated 3D T1-weighted images of single subjects (generated by the segmentation step) to warp them to the common DARTEL space and then modulated using the Jacobian determinants. Since the DARTEL process warps to a common space that is smaller than the MNI space, we performed an additional\ntested using two datasets obtained by different MR protocols and scanners in order to capture the full spectrum of heterogeneity among data and provide a less dataset-specific approach. In fact, our approach overcomes the caveats of previous works, which have obtained data from single-center datasets leading to a limited reproducibility of findings.\nWe also observed that the studied model is not affected by image quality to different degrees as provided by data augmentation. Second, transfer learning from the AD vs controls ADNI comparison was applied for computational efficiency (Hosseini-Asl et al., 2016) . Models trained with AD and control subjects can be particularly effective when attempting to distinguish c-MCI and s-MCI patients, as the differences among MCI groups are expected to be smaller than those between AD and controls (Bozzali et al., 2006) . Therefore, a pre-trained model is the ideal tool to be used in routine clinical practice because it is a less time-consuming task and can provide high performance in distinguishing only slightly different images. Our approach is finally unique as we used a simplified CNN architecture called \"all convolutional network\", which is optimized to achieve state-of-the-art performances with the minimum necessary CNN components (Springenberg et al., 2015 ) . The great advantage of such a network model relative to standard CNNs is that it greatly reduces the number of network parameters and thus serves as a form of regularization (Springenberg et al., 2015 ) .\nAs in previous supervised and unsupervised machine learning studies (Rathore et al., 2017; Vieira et al., 2017) (Table 1) , accuracy in identifying c-MCI from s-MCI patients was not as high as when classifying AD or MCI patients from healthy controls. Using deep neural networks, combined with sparse regression models, a recent structural MRI study obtained a similar accuracy in identifying c-MCI patients (Suk et al., 2017) . Importantly, multiple biomarker modalities may help enhance the diagnostic accuracy in MCI population. The most widely accepted diagnostic criteria for AD assume that the greatest accuracy can be achieved with a combination of amyloidosis and neurodegeneration biomarkers (Albert et al., 2011; Dubois et al., 2014; McKhann et al., 2011) . It is worth noted that the accuracy achieved by our algorithm is also comparable to that of previous\nstudies applying deep learning algorithms on multimodal datasets (e.g., clinical, cognitive, CSF, MRI, and PET (Vieira et al., 2017)), thus suggesting that there may be a huge margin of improvement using our simplified deep learning architecture in a multimodal biomarker framework.\nIn light of this, in particular for the crucial comparison between c-MCI and s-MCI, future studies should consider to add other MRI sequences (such as functional MRI and/or diffusion tensor imaging), PET and CSF biomarkers together with neuropsychological scores and genetic information in order to improve the power of classification.\nThere are some limitations that need to be considered. First, we cannot exclude the presence of future c-MCI among s-MCI patients. Indeed, a longer clinical follow up may improve clinical diagnosis and thus our algorithm performance. As previously mentioned, our model should be tested in combination with clinical, cognitive, genetic, PET and CSF biomarkers to improve the prediction of full-blown dementia development in MCI patients. Third, AD is a clinically heterogeneous disease and this should not be ignored. Effective diagnostic tools should be developed that can deal with atypical AD presentations, like posterior cortical atrophy and logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia. Finally, neurodegeneration due to AD occurs years, even decades, before the clinical onset (Jack and Holtzman, 2013) . Future studies are warranted to test the accuracy of the procedure in identifying subjects in the preclinical phase of the disease and, potentially, as a screening tool in the general population to identifying people at high risk of developing dementia.\nIn conclusion, CNNs show promises for building a model for the automated, individual and early detection of AD and thus accelerating the adoption of structural MRI in routine practice to help assessment and management of patients.\n"}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be improved by the use of biomarkers (Albert et al., 2011; Dubois et al., 2014; McKhann et al., 2011) . Structural MRI, which provides biomarkers of neuronal loss, is an integral part of the clinical assessment of patients with suspected AD (Albert et al., 2011; Dubois et al., 2014; McKhann et al., 2011) . Several studies have shown that atrophy estimates in characteristically vulnerable brain regions, particularly the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, reflect disease stage and are predictive of progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD (Frisoni et al., 2010) . The clinical utility of structural MRI in differentiating AD from other diseases, such as vascular or non-AD dementia, has been also established (Frisoni et al., 2010) . However, the value of structural MRI will be increased by standardization of acquisition and analysis methods, and by development of robust algorithms for automated assessment. All of these are needed to achieve the ultimate goal of individual patient diagnosis with a single cross-sectional structural MRI scan and for structural MRI to be definitely qualified by regulatory agencies as a biomarker for enrichment of pre-dementia AD trials (Frisoni et al., 2017) .\nPrevious work in computer-aided classification of AD and MCI patients has used several machine learning methods applied to structural MRI (Rathore et al., 2017) . The most popular amongst these methods is Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Rathore et al., 2017) . SVM extracts high-dimensional, informative features from MRI to build predictive classification models that facilitate the automation of clinical diagnosis (Rathore et al., 2017) . However, feature definition and extraction typically rely on manual/semi-automatic outlining of brain structures, which is laborious and prone to inter-and intra-rater variability, or complex image pre-processing, which is timeconsuming and computational demanding.\nAn alternative family of machine learning methods, known as deep learning algorithms, are achieving optimal results in many domains such as speech recognition tasks, computer vision and natural language understanding (LeCun et al., 2015) and, more recently, medical analysis (Esteva et Vieira et al., 2017; Xiong et al., 2015) . Deep learning algorithms differ from conventional machine learning methods by the fact that they require little or no image pre-processing and can automatically infer an optimal representation of the data from the raw images without requiring prior feature selection, resulting in a more objective and less bias-prone process (LeCun et al., 2015; Vieira et al., 2017) . Therefore, deep learning algorithms are better suited for detecting subtle and diffuse anatomical abnormalities (LeCun et al., 2015; Vieira et al., 2017) . Recently, deep learning has been successfully applied to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset to identify AD patients from healthy controls (Table 1 ) (for a review see (Vieira et al., 2017) The aim of the present study was to build and validate a deep learning algorithm (specifically convolutional neural networks [CNN] ) that can predict the individual diagnosis of AD and the development of AD in MCI patients based on a single cross-sectional brain structural MRI scan. A robust diagnostic marker should adapt to various datasets to diminish discrepancies in data distribution and biases toward specific groups (Frisoni et al., 2017) . One of the most important caveats of previous works is the single-center origin of imaging data that limits the generalizability of findings. In light of this, one of the main goal and novelty of our study was to overcome this limit by comparing data from different centers, neuroimaging protocols and scanners, in order to reach both reliability and reproducibility of results."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "We used the structural brain MRI scans from the ADNI dataset (adni.loni.usc.edu).

Standard 3T baseline T1-weighted images were included from the ADNI dataset. We included all ADNI1, ADNI2 and ADNI-GO subjects that had baseline 3D T1-weighted scans. After 36 months, 253 MCI patients (33%) converted clinically to AD (c-MCI).\nAn independent dataset of 3D T1-weighted images were obtained from 229 subjects (hereafter named as \"Milan\" dataset) including 124 patients with probable AD, (McKhann et al., 2011) 50 patients with MCI (Albert et al., 2011) , and 55 healthy controls who were recruited consecutively at the Department of Neurology, Scientific Institute and University Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan (Table 3) . After 36 months, 27 (54%) MCI patients converted clinically to AD. An experienced neurologist blinded to MRI results performed clinical assessments. Healthy controls with no history of neurologic, psychiatric or other major medical illnesses were recruited among friends and spouses of patients and by word of mouth (Table 3 ).\nIn both datasets (ADNI and Milan), the conversion from MCI to dementia was established clinically. This was a judgment made by skilled clinicians on the determination of whether or not there was significant interference in the ability to function at work or in usual daily activities based on the information obtained from the patient and from a knowledgeable caregiver.\nThis cross-sectional study was approved by the Local Ethical Committee on human studies and written informed consent from all subjects was obtained prior to their enrolment."}, {"section_title": "MRI acquisition protocol", "text": "Details about the ADNI MRI data acquisition protocol can be seen in ADNI's official webpage (adni.loni.usc.edu).

First, given the volumetric nature of MR images, a network architecture that uses 3D convolutions was developed. The inputs were normalized 3D T1-weighted images and the outputs to be predicted were subject groups. The architecture of the network contains: 12 repeated blocks of convolutional layers (2 blocks with 50 kernels of size 5 x 5 x 5 with alternating strides 1 and 2 and 10 blocks with 100 to 1600 kernels of size 3 x 3 x 3 with alternating strides 1 and 2); a Rectified Linear Unit (activation layer); a fullyconnected layer; and one output (logistic regression) layer. The network used in our study differs from the standard CNNs as max-pooling layers were replaced by standard convolutional layers with stride of 2 ('all convolutional network '(Springenberg et al., 2015 ) ). The all convolutional network is a basic architecture reaching good performance without the need for complicated activation functions, any response normalization or max-pooling (Springenberg et al., 2015 ) .

CNN's performance was evaluated by several performance measures, i.e. sensitivity, specificity and accuracy.

The accuracy of a classifier represents the overall proportion of correct classifications. Table 4 reports binary classification performances of the CNNs in the testing datasets. The results demonstrated that high levels of accuracy were achieved in all the comparisons. Highest accuracy, sensitivity and specificity (higher than 98%) were obtained in the AD vs HC classification tests using both the ADNI dataset and the combined ADNI + Milan dataset (Table 4) .

In distinguishing c-MCI from s-MCI subjects, CNNs reached an accuracy up to about 75%, with no differences between ADNI and non-ADNI images (Table 4) ."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Effective and accurate AD diagnosis is critical for early treatment. Therefore many researchers have devoted their efforts to develop a computer-aided system, which can diagnose AD in the early stages and on an individual basis (Rathore et al., 2017; Vieira et al., 2017) . In this study,\nwe built and validated a deep learning algorithm that predicts the individual diagnosis of AD and MCI who will convert to AD based on a single cross-sectional brain structural MRI scan. Results showed that our CNN was highly-performing in differentiating AD and MCI patients from healthy controls and good-performing in predicting conversion to AD within 36 months. Importantly, our algorithm performed well without any prior feature engineering and regardless the variability of imaging protocols and scanners, demonstrating that it is exploitable by not-trained operators and likely to be generalizable to unseen patient data.\nThe strengths of our approach relative to previous deep learning studies in AD (Vieira et al., 2017) (Table 1) are several. First, heterogeneous MRI data proved to be a challenge for all evaluated models with performance deteriorating more, when images were obtained using different MR protocols and areas of the images known to be important for identity inference are inhomogeneous, deformed or lacking (Han et al., 2006; Takao et al., 2014) . Structured programs aimed at standardizing and harmonizing MRI acquisition and analysis for AD diagnosis and management are ongoing in research settings (Frisoni et al., 2015; Reijs et al., 2015; Weiner et al., 2017) . However, data obtained in these selected frameworks might not be representative of realworld populations. This is one of the main reason why current diagnostic criteria for AD are extremely cautious on recommending the use of MRI in a clinical setting (Albert et al., 2011; Dubois et al., 2014; McKhann et al., 2011) .
