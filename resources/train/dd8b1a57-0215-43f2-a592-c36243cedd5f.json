It is well recognized that the brain pathological changes that characterize AD, i.e. amyloid and tau pathology and synaptic and neuronal loss, develop slowly over many years, possibly decades, before patients manifest the first subtle cognitive changes [2, 3] . There is general agreement on the idea that diseasemodifying treatments are likely to have maximal effect before extensive and irreversible brain damage has occurred, and ideally before symptom onset [4, 5] , so clinical trials are moving accordingly towards the preclinical stages of AD [6] . This reinforces the importance of biomarkers to increase diagnostic accuracy, predict disease progression at early stages, and improve assessment of therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials [7] .\nAD biomarkers have been generally grouped into two categories reflecting the underlying neuropathology: 1. Biomarkers of brain amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) deposition: low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b242 concentration [7] and positive PET amyloid imaging [8] . 2. Biomarkers of tau deposition, neuronal loss and neurodegeneration: increased levels of CSF total Tau (ttau) and phosphorylated Tau (ptau-181) [9] , decreased fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake on PET imaging [10] , and regional cortical atrophy on volumetric MRI [11] . Most of these biomarkers have been validated in populations of symptomatic patients and are associated with high sensitivity and specificity for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD dementia [9] . While several longitudinal follow-up studies have examined the potential role of AD neuroimaging biomarkers to predict subsequent decline in cognition among cognitively normal subjects [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , very few have examined the predictive value of combined CSF and neuroimaging biomarkers in this population; something that may prove key to accurately identifying candidates who could benefit most from therapies aimed at preserving cognition in the presence of brain AD pathology.\nIn the present study, we investigated the relation of several CSF and neuroimaging biomarkers of brain AD pathology (CSF A\u03b242, t-tau and ptau-181, MRI-based hippocampal volume, in vivo brain amyloid load as reported by PiB-PET retention, and FDG-PET"}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Participants were community-dwelling volunteers, enrolled in longitudinal cohorts as part of the Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (MADRC) and the Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS) [20] . Baseline and annual assessments included a general and neurological exam, the Washington University Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) [21] , and a standard battery of neuropsychological tests [22] . As part of the study, participants were offered at baseline the possibility of undergoing additional exams including lumbar puncture (LP), brain MRI, amyloid PET imaging using Pittsburgh compound B (PiB-PET) and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET scan. Examiners performing annual neurological and neuropsychological assessments were blinded to biomarker results.\nAll participants, aged 60 or older, in the two cohorts with available CSF assessments and a global CDR score of 0 within a year of the LP were included in the study. The CDR is an assessment instrument that yields global and Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) scores. The global CDR is a 5-point scale used to characterize six domains of cognitive and functional performance applicable to AD and related dementias: Memory, Orientation, Judgment and Problem Solving, Community Affairs, Home and Hobbies, and Personal Care. The information to make each rating is obtained through a semi-structured interview with the patient and a reliable informant [23] . A global CDR of 0 corresponds to normal cognition, while 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 correspond to questionable, mild, moderate, and severe dementia, respectively. The CDR-SOB score is obtained by summing each of the domain box scores, with scores ranging from 0 to 18.\nThe study was performed using protocols reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of the Partners Health Care.

Multivariate models were adjusted for gender, education, age, APOE status (at least one \u03b54 allele versus none), and MMSE score at the time of CSF exam.

We used z-scores to estimate standardized regression coefficients, which allow comparing the strength of relations between cognition change and the different biomarkers. These z scores were modeled as continuous variables to ensure that selection of a cut-off value did not drive the results. To investigate the relationship between combined CSF biomarkers, we dichotomized CSF t-Tau at the upper quartile and CSF A\u03b242 at the lowest quartile.

Their baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1 . Mean age was 72.0 (SD=7.2) years, 59% were women, and the median duration of follow-up was 3.2 years. Our subjects had a relatively high average level of education (mean years of education: 17.2 [9.4] ) and high cognitive performances at baseline (mean MMSE score: 29.1 [1.0]). Subjects who agreed to additional neuroimaging exams were significantly older than those who did not (mean age: 73.1 vs. 66.6 years, p<0.001); no differences were observed in any other parameter. During follow-up, 12 (14%) subjects showed an increase in global CDR from 0 to 0.5. There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics at baseline (including neuropsychological measures) between those whose global CDR increased and those who remained stable (Table 1) . Among the various biomarkers analyzed, subjects who showed increased in global CDR had higher CSF t-tau and PiB-PET retention compared to subjects with stable global CDR. Spearman rank correlation coefficients between the biomarkers are presented in Supplementary Table 1 . Table 2 shows the multivariable analysis of the relationship between baseline biomarkers and the hazard of increase in global CDR from 0 to 0.5 during follow-up. After adjustment for age, gender, baseline MMSE score, APOE status, and education, an increase in global CDR was associated with higher CSF t-Tau, CSF p-Tau 181 and PiB-PET retention, and with lower MRI hippocampal volume. There was a 3-fold increase in hazard of progressing from CDR 0 to 0.5 for every standard deviation (SD) increase in CSF t-Tau (HR=3.14, 95% CI: 1.66-5.95). There was a 2.5 fold increase in hazard of progressing from CDR 0 to 0.5 per 1 SD decrease hippocampal volume (HR = 2.47, 1.28 to 4.79). CSF A\u03b242 and FDG-PET uptake, however, were not associated with CDR change. After multiple comparisons, only CSF t-Tau and MRI hippocampal volume remained associated with a longitudinal increase in global CDR.\nAn analysis based on combined CSF biomarkers is presented in Table 3 . Participants with CSF t-Tau levels in the upper quartile (4 th quartile) had a higher risk of increase in global CDR during follow-up compared to those in the other quartiles (HR = 3.37, 95% CI: 1.29 to 8.80). No significantly higher risk was observed among participants with CSF A\u03b242 levels falling in the lower quartile (HR=1.76, 95% CI: 0.71 to 4.37). The combination of these two biomarkers was most strongly related to cognitive outcomes, and became statistically significant for subjects with both high CSF t-Tau (upper quartile) and low CSF A\u03b242 (lower quartile) (HR=5.65, 1.68 to 19.05). Table 4 shows the association between the various AD biomarkers and the risk of increase in global CDR during follow-up, using cut-offs based on lowest or highest quartiles of distribution. CSF t-Tau and PiB-PET retention were the only two single biomarkers significantly associated with increase in global CDR. In combination analysis, high CSF t-Tau combined with low CSF A\u03b242 (HR=4.46, 1.55 -12.87) or with low hippocampal volume (HR=4.84, 1.83 -12.82) were the strongest biomarker combinations associated with global CDR increase.\nSupplementary Figure 1 shows ROC curves for the various single biomarkers to discriminate participants whose global CDR increased from 0 to 0.5 from those who showed no change. In these analyses, only PiB-PET retention (AUC [standard error]=0.73 [0.10], p=0.01) and CSF t-Tau level (AUC = 0.70 [0.08], p=0.006) had AUC significantly different from the null value of 0.50. Table 5 shows the linear mixed model estimates of the relationship between baseline biomarkers and repeated MMSE scores over follow-up, adjusted for age, gender, APOE genotype, and education. CSF t-Tau was the only single biomarker significantly associated with subsequent decline in MMSE score (estimate \u03b2 = \u22120.066, standard error = 0.03, p=0.02). The annual change in MMSE score according to baseline levels of CSF t-Tau is presented in Supplementary Figure 2 . Subjects in the upper quartile for CSF t-Tau had a significantly lower MMSE score after 2 years (p=0.001) and 3 years (p=0.005) compared to those in the other 3 lower quartiles.\nIn sensitivity analysis, we excluded 13 participants with a global CDR of 0 but CDR-SOB score > 0 (= 0.5) at baseline. This analysis gave virtually identical results to those described above ( Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 )."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "We analyzed the relationship between baseline CSF and neuroimaging biomarkers of AD brain pathology and future change in cognition in a cohort of 84 cognitively normal subjects aged 60 or older who were followed longitudinally for approximately 3 years. At group level, CSF t-Tau and p-Tau 181, MRI hippocampal volume and PiB-PET retention were all independently associated with increase in global CDR score during follow-up. The combination of high CSF t-Tau and low CSF A\u03b242 was more strongly related to cognitive outcome than either biomarker alone. Neither CSF A\u03b242 nor FDG-PET uptake were associated with CDR change. Importantly, CSF t-Tau level was the only single biomarker significantly associated with longitudinal decrease in MMSE score. However, when ROC curve analyses were conducted, only CSF t-Tau and PiB-PET retention showed AUC significantly greater than 0.50 (at approximately 0.70 in both cases), corresponding only to a modest discriminatory power to distinguish participants who exhibited a longitudinal decline.\nAD biomarkers have been extensively investigated among AD and non-AD symptomatic patients. However, limited data are available on combined CSF and imaging biomarkers in cognitively normal populations, and these offer inconsistent results. While some studies have found that decreased CSF A\u03b242 is associated with cognitive decline among normal older adults [27] [28] [29] [30] , others could not confirm these observations [31, 32] . Prior work by Palmqvist and colleagues. suggested that CSF A\u03b242 can be used with high accuracy to determine whether a patient has increased brain amyloid deposition [33] . In that study, increased amyloid deposition by PET, but not CSF A\u03b242, significantly correlated with disease stage among patients with mild cognitive symptoms. The same authors recently reported that the diagnostic accuracy of CSF biomarkers and amyloid PET for diagnosing early-stage AD is comparable [34] . A previously published report, with similar design to the present study, failed to demonstrate an association between CSF biomarkers and cognitive decline in non-demented elderly [31] . In that study, increased CSF t-Tau was the only CSF biomarker with a trend to correlate with increase in global CDR. In another study, CSF t-Tau and A\u03b242, and PET amyloid load, all predicted cognitive decline without significant differences in their individual predictive ability [30] . Another recent exploratory analysis of a cognitively normal cohort followed up for a median of 3.1 years suggested that elevation in baseline brain amyloid level was associated with higher likelihood of cognitive decline [35] . A study based on ADNI subjects reported that structural MRI and CSF Tau had the strongest predictive value for progression from normal to MCI [36] . More recently, Soldan and colleagues found that, among cognitively normal adults, those with combined high CSF t-Tau or p-Tau and low CSF A\u03b242 had significantly lower baseline cognitive scores and the greatest cognitive decline after follow-up [37] .\nIt is worth noting that in our study we did not find an association between lower brain glucose metabolism, as measured by FDG-PET, and cognitive decline. Paradoxically, lower glucose metabolism tended to correlate with lower risk of increase in global CDR over follow-up (HR=0.65, 0.33-1.28). In agreement with this observation, recent studies reported that the brain hypometabolic pattern typically observed in symptomatic AD patients can be preceded by a hypermetabolic phase [38] , pointing towards a potential compensatory mechanism at preclinical disease stages [39] . It is also interesting that in our study in vivo amyloid load was associated with cognitive change but CSF A\u03b242 level was not. Of note, the kinetics of CSF A\u03b242 in very early stages of the transition from normal cognition to very subtle cognitive changes in sporadic AD remains largely unknown. Data from studies on carriers of autosomal-dominant AD mutations [2, 40] , as well as from experimental studies [41] , suggest that CSF A\u03b242 levels transiently increase during the early phase of brain amyloid deposition.\nThe current study is not without limitations. First, the relatively small cohort size and the limited number of events may have diminished the power of our study to detect subtle "}, {"section_title": "Author Manuscript", "text": "Author Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript effects on cognition of some of the biomarkers assessed. Second, our cohort contains a large proportion of participants more highly educated than the general population. The likely higher cognitive reserve in this population may alter the association of these biomarkers and cognition, and limits the generalizability of the findings [42] . Third, despite the finding of statistically significant associations between CSF and neuroimaging biomarkers and cognitive change at the group level in this study, the predictive value of these biomarkers, alone or in combination, to discriminate decliners from non-decliners at the individual level remained quite modest (as characterized by a low AUC) after 3-year follow-up. This is particularly relevant for the rational design of intervention studies in cognitively normal older adults at risk of AD, and highlights the need of further studies to define the value of AD biomarkers for predicting cognitive decline in those with normal cognition. Recently developed PET tau tracers that exhibit high affinity for neurofibrillary tangle pathology, like AV-1451, have now the potential to improve the predictive value of AD biomarkers in asymptomatic individuals [43, 44] ."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "Higher CSF t-Tau and PiB-PET retention (in vivo amyloid load) were the single biomarkers that best predicted at the group level future decline in cognition in the cohort of 84 cognitively normal older adults studied here. The combination of high CSF t-Tau and low CSF A\u03b242 or low hippocampal volume were significantly more predictive of future cognitive outcomes than any single biomarker. Our results reinforce the notion that AD pathology builds up slowly during a long preclinical phase of the disease that predates subtle changes in cognition. However, they also highlight the relatively modest performance of the biomarkers studied here, either alone or in combination, for predicting decline in cognition at the individual level among cognitively normal older adults after 3-year follow-up. These findings may prove relevant when designing preventive interventions within this time frame in asymptomatic subjects at risk of AD, and emphasize that efforts to optimize cutoff points of currently known biomarkers, as well as to develop and validate novel biomarkers with higher predictive value at the individual level are greatly needed.
