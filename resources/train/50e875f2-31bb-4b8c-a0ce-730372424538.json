Larger family farms have more operators. Because farms are generally family businesses, family members other than the primary operators often serve as secondary operators. About two-thirds of the additional operators are the spouses of the primary operators. The number of operators per farm also tends to increase with size, because today's commercial farms often require more management and labor than an individual can provide. The number of operators per farm reaches 1.9-on average-for very large family farms. About a third of the very large multiple-operator farms have operators spanning more than one generation.\nSmall family farms account for most U.S. farms and hold most farm assets\u2026 Small family farms accounted for 91 percent of the farms in the United States in 2003. They also held about 71 percent of all farm assets, including 70 percent of the land owned by farms. As custodians of the bulk of farm assets-including land-small farms have a large role in natural resource and environmental policy. Small farms accounted for about 82 percent of the land enrolled by farmers in the Conservation Reserve and Wetlands Reserve Programs.\n. . . But very large family farms and nonfamily farms produce a growing share of agricultural output. Large and very large family farms, plus nonfamily farms, made up 9 percent of U.S. farms in 2003 but accounted for 73 percent of the value of production. Production has shifted sharply to very large farms and nonfamily farms since the late 1980s, mainly from small farms with sales between $10,000 and $249,999. Shifts in production away from small farms in that sales class are likely to continue, given their negative operating profit margin (on average) and the large and growing share of their operators who are at least 65 years old.\n(Sales classes are expressed in 2003 dollars in this summary and throughout the report.)\nNevertheless, small farms currently make significant contributions to the production of specific commodities, including hay, tobacco, cash grains and soybeans, dairy products, and beef cattle. Most production by small farms is concentrated among low-and medium-sales farms.\nLarge-scale farms are more likely than small farms to use contracts. Less than 10 percent of limited-resource, retirement, residential/lifestyle, and low-sales farms use production or marketing contracts. Twenty-eight percent of medium-sales farms have contracts, but this is much less than the share of large and very large farms that have contracts, 45 percent and 63 percent, respectively. Production under contact is concentrated among very large family farms, which account for 59 percent of the total production under marketing or production contracts.\nContracting has grown at a slow and steady rate over the years, but change is more rapid for some commodities. The share of total agricultural production under contract grew by only 5 percentage points, from 34 percent to 39 percent, between 1994-95 and 2003 . But during the same period, the share of tobacco production covered by contracts went from 1 percent to 55 percent, while the contracting share of hogs increased from 31 percent to 57 percent.\nPayments from conservation and commodity-related programs go to different types of farms. There are two main types of government payments-those from commodity-related programs and those from conservation programs. The distribution of commodity program payments is roughly proportional to the production of program commodities. As a result, medium-sales farms and large-scale farms received about three-quarters of commodity-related government payments in 2003. In contrast, the Conservation Reserve and Wetlands Reserve Programs target environmentally sensitive land rather than commodity production. Retirement, residential/lifestyle, and low-sales small farms received 64 percent of conservation program payments in 2003.\nSmall-farm households rely on off-farm income. Average operating profit margins and average rates of return on assets and equity are negative for small farms, but positive for large, very large, and nonfamily farms. So, how do so many small farms continue to exist? Small-farm households typically receive substantial off-farm income and do not rely primarily on the farms for their livelihood. Most off-farm income is from earned sources, either wage-and-salary jobs or self-employment. Even households operating large and very large farms also receive earned off-farm income of about $30,000 on average. For households receiving substantial off-farm income, changes in tax laws and the health of the nonfarm economy are probably more important than payments from farm programs.\nCombining farm and off-farm income, the median farm household income in 2003 ($47,600) was 10 percent greater than the median for all U.S. households ($43,300) . Only operators of limited-resource and retirement farms had a median income below the U.S. level."}, {"section_title": "How Was the Study Conducted?", "text": "The Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) is the main source of data in the 2005 Family Farm Report.

The report uses the farm classification system developed by ERS to examine farm structure in the United States.\n1 Farm structure is generally defined broadly, often with a list of topics covered. For example, the definition used by Penn (1979, p. 5 ) over 25 years ago lists 10 components that overlap substantially with Boehlje's definition, quoted in the text."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Farming in the United States is diverse, ranging from very small retirement and residential farms to enterprises with annual sales in the millions of dollars. Farms are operated by individuals on a part-time basis, by multiple generations of a family, and by managers of nonfamily corporations. Some specialize in a single product, while others produce a wide variety of products.\nThis report presents comprehensive information about the structural and financial characteristics of the various types of family farms in the United States. It examines important trends currently affecting family farms, following Boehlje (1992, p. 219) , who defines the structure of an industry or sector-including the farm sector-along five dimensions. They are:\n(1) The size distribution of firms (2) The technology and production characteristics of those firms including type of activity and level of specialization (3) The characterization of the workforce (both managers/entrepreneurs and employees) including age, education, experience, skill level, part time versus full time status, etc. (4) The resource ownership and financing pattern, including tenancy, leasing and debt/equity sources and relationships (5) The inter-and intrasector linkages, including contract production and vertical and horizontal integration. Each section of this report deals with one or more of those five dimensions of the structure of agriculture. 1\nAs in previous recent years, the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS), an annual survey, is the main source of data in the Family Farm Report. The ARMS is jointly designed and conducted by the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), both agencies of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The report also uses data from the Farm Costs and Returns Survey (FCRS)-the predecessor to ARMS-and from various censuses of agriculture and ERS farm sector income estimates, particularly when following trends over long periods of time. 2 Because U.S. farms are diverse, ERS developed a farm classification system to examine farm structure (see box, \"Farm Types, 2003\"). The farm classification system categorizes farms into homogeneous groups, based primarily on annual sales of the farms and the major occupation of their operators. By using these homogeneous groups, a clearer picture emerges of the status of farms in the United States today.\nThe 2003 classification includes a new definition of limited-resource farms (U.S. National Archives and Records Admn., 2003, p. 32520) developed to provide a consistent definition applied across all USDA agencies. The new definition is based on low household income persisting for 2 years and low gross sales of agricultural products. The household income data necessary for this definition were collected for the first time in the 2003 ARMS. Residential/lifestyle farms.

Family farms exclude farms organized as nonfamily corporations or cooperatives, as well as farms with hired managers. Other definitions of the family farm exist, but they are usually more restrictive (Banker and MacDonald, 2005, pp 2-3, 81-82) .\nBeginning with this report, the Family Farm Report series will feature a special topic each year. The special feature this year is \"multiple-operator farms.\""}, {"section_title": "Multiple-Operator Farms", "text": "Some farms have more than one operator, defined as anyone who makes day-to-day-decisions about the farm business. Traditionally, farm data sources in the United States assumed each farm has only one operator. Recent surveys, however, count all farm operators, and there are 3.2 million operators on the 2.1 million U.S. farms (table 1) . 3 Thus, a \"one-farm, oneoperator\" rule would understate the count of farm operators by about 1.1 million. Multiple-operator farms produce a large share of agricultural output, approximately 64 percent of the value of production.\nBecause farms are generally family businesses, one would expect family members other than the principal operator to make decisions. For example, about two-thirds of the additional operators-750,000 out of 1.1 millionare spouses. The number of operators per farm also tends to increase with size, because commercial farms often require more management and labor than an individual can provide. The number of operators per farm reaches 1.9 operators-on average-for very large family farms. About 67 percent of farms of that size have two or more operators (versus 47 percent for all U.S. farms). Seventy-one percent of dairy farms have multiple operators ( fig. 1) , which is understandable, given the high labor requirements of dairy enterprises.\nAbout 17 percent of multiple-operator farms are multiple-generation farms, with at least a 20-year difference between the ages of the oldest and youngest operators (table 1) . 4 Multiple-generation farms are more common when the principal operator is 65 years old or older. Multiple-generation farms make up 29 percent of multiple-operator farms when the principal operator is age 65 or older, compared with 17 percent for multiple-operator farms in general. This helps explain the relatively large share of multiplegeneration farms among limited-resource and retirement farms, since operators of these farms are more likely to be that age. In the remaining family farms, multiple-generation farms become more common as farm size increases, reaching approximately 31 percent of multiple-operator farms for very large farms. According to the Census of Agriculture, the number of U.S. farms fell sharply until the early 1970s after peaking at 6.8 million in 1935 ( fig. 2) . Falling farm numbers during this period reflected growing productivity in agriculture and increased nonfarm employment opportunities (Hoppe, 1994, p. 1) . Growing productivity led to excess capacity in agriculture, farm consolidation, and farm operators leaving farming to work in the nonfarm economy. The decline in farm numbers slowed in the 1980s and nearly stopped in the 1990s. By 2002, about 2.1 million farms remained. 5 Because the amount of farmland did not decrease as much as the number of farms, the remaining farms have more acreage, on average.

The remaining 2 percent are nonfamily farms, which produce 14 percent of total agricultural output ( fig. 3 ). Two features of family farms stand out. First, small family farms make up 91 percent of all U.S. farms. Second, large-scale family farms account for 59 percent of all production.\nNevertheless, small farms make significant contributions to the production of specific commodities. Small farms account for 63 percent of the value of production for hay, 58 percent for tobacco, 39 percent for cash grains (including soybeans), 37 percent for dairy products, and 33 percent for beef cattle. At the other extreme, small farms account for only 8 percent of the value of production for hogs and 4 percent for poultry. Most small-farm production is concentrated among farming-occupation farms, which account for 19 percent of total U.S. production.\nThe share of assets and land held by small farms is substantially more than indicated by their 27-percent share of production. Small farms hold about 71 percent of all farm assets, including 70 percent of the land owned by farms ( fig. 4) . Because of their large land holdings-in aggregate-small farms are important in conservation efforts.

These types accounted for 58 percent of the value of production in 2003, compared with 38 percent in 1989, shifting mainly from farms with annual sales between $10,000 and $249,999 and-to a lesser extent-large family farms. Most of the shift in production to nonfamily farms occurred between 1989 and 1995, while the shift to large family farms occurred later, between 1995 and 2003.

The 1.4 million limited-resource, retirement, and residential/lifestyle farms account for only 8 percent of production because most of these farms are very small. Roughly threefourths of the farms in each of the three groups have annual sales of less than $10,000 (table 3) . The average acreage operated by farms in these three groups is also small, ranging from 167 to 189 acres.\nAlthough only 37 percent of farming-occupation/low-sales farms have sales of less than $10,000, nearly three-fourths have sales of less than $50,000. On average, low-sales farms operate 463 acres, or more than double the averages for the limited-resource, retirement, or residential/lifestyle farms. This acreage is small, however, compared with those for medium-sales small farms and the two types of large-scale farms, which ranged from 1,200 to 2,400 acres. Thirty-seven percent of very large family farms and 10 percent of nonfamily farms have sales of at least $1 million.

Because these farms have a hired manager, they are classified as nonfamily farms. The relatively high average acreage for nonfamily farms reflects a small share of farms in the group with a large acreage.\nTenure. Renting land is no longer considered primarily a method for entry into farming. It has become a way to expand by controlling additional land without the debt and commitment of capital associated with ownership (Reimund and Gale, 1992, pp. 7-8) . About two-thirds of the medium-sales farms and large-scale farms are part-owners, meaning that they own part of the land they operate and rent the rest. In addition, about 17 percent of very large family farms are tenants that own none of the land they farm. This is a larger tenancy percentage than is true for any other type of farm."}, {"section_title": "Specialization", "text": "Specialization varies by farm size. Small farms tend to specialize in raising beef cattle, other grazing livestock, and various crops (table 4) . Poultry, hogs and high-value crops tend to be produced on larger farms. Medium-sales small farms and large family farms are most likely to specialize in grain.\nBeef cattle. Beef cattle are by far the most common specialization among small farms, accounting for 35 percent to 41 percent of limited-resource, retirement, residential/lifestyle, and low-sales farms (table 4) . Beef cattlecommonly cow-calf enterprises in the case of small farms-offer three advantages to operators of small-farms:\n(1) Cattle are less labor-intensive than many other enterprises, which may be attractive to an operator who is retired or holds a full-time job off the farm.\n(2) Cattle enterprises tend to be low-cost, which limits cash requirements.\n(3) Producing calves has the potential to produce losses that can be written off against off-farm income.\n(For more details, see box \"Why Beef Cattle?\")\nOther Specializations. Other small-farm specializations vary by type of farm. One-fourth of limited-resource and residential/lifestyle farms specialize in \"other livestock,\" including horses, sheep, and goats. \"Other field crops\" is a common specialization for limited-resource, retirement, residential/lifestyle farms, and low-sales farms. This category also includes farms with all their crop acres in the CRP and WRP.\nSome specializations are more common among farms with sales greater than $100,000 (medium-sales and the two types of large-scale farms). Farms specializing in cash grains and soybeans account for more than 40 percent of medium-sales farms and large family farms. In addition, 20 percent of medium-sales farms specialize in dairy, approximately double the percentage for any other type. Very large family farms are at least twice as likely as any other type to specialize in poultry or hogs, accounting for 75 percent of poultry production and 61 percent of hog production. Beef cattle-particularly cow-calf enterprises-are a common specialization among small farms (Cash, 2002, p. 21) . In a cow-calf enterprise, a breeding herd is operated with a few bulls. To generate revenue, the farmer sells steer calves, some of the heifer calves, and culled cows.\nNearly half of the farms with sales between $10,000 and $49,000 specialize in beef cattle (see the table below). About one-third of farms with sales less than $10,000 also specialize in beef, as well as a similar share of farms with sales between $50,000 and $99,000. The two remaining sales classes classified as small farms are less likely to specialize in beef cattle. Even so, about one out of six of those farms also specialize in beef.\nWhy do so many small farms, particularly those with sales less than $100,000, specialize in beef cattle? Beef cattle have three main advantages for small farms:\n\u2022 Cattle operations are less labor-intensive than many other enterprises, making it easier to combine them with off-farm employment (Cash, 2002, p. 21) . In contrast to hogs and chickens, cattle roam freely with little need for direct supervision, except when calving. Cattle are fairly self-sufficient, except in winter when forage is not available.\n\u2022 Cattle operations tend to be low-cost, which limits cash requirements (Cash, 2002, p. 21) . Variable costs generally are lower than those for field crop enterprises. Cattle eat grass and require little additional feed, except during the winter. Fixed costs for land, water access, and fencing make up a large share of the expenses for cow-calf enterprises. These costs, however, represent long-lived assets that only require repair.\n\u2022 Under the existing tax code, losses from farming can be written off against income from other sources. The writeoff is unlimited, if the farm has the potential to be profitable and the filer is materially involved in operating the farm (Freshwater and Reimer, 1995, p. 220) . Some farmers may take advantage of the writeoff by producing a commodity-such as calves-that allows them to group their expense and sales in different years to generate small profits in some years and large losses in others."}, {"section_title": "Why Beef Cattle?", "text": "Small farms prefer beef cattle High-value crops. Production of high-value crops is heavily concentrated among very large family farms and nonfamily farms, which together account for 76 percent of the total. Although high-value crop enterprises are sometimes suggested as ways to boost the earnings of small farmers, no more than 9 percent of any small-farm type specializes in these crops. Highvalue crops can generate large sales per acre, but they require substantially more labor than cattle and they may require more effort to market."}, {"section_title": "Diversification", "text": "Farms today tend to be specialized, with individual farms typically producing very few commodities. Only 22 percent of U.S. farms produced more than two commodities in 2003. Sixty-five percent of U.S. farms produced only one or two commodities in 2003, and 13 percent had no production at all. Farms with no production include those with all their cropland in the CRP or WRP, as well as farms experiencing crop failure or loss of livestock from disease or other causes.\nFarms become more diversified as size increases. Many small farms specialize in a single commodity or produce nothing at all. Mediumsales farms and large-scale farms are more likely to produce multiple commodities: three-fifths of farms in these groups produce three or more commodities."}, {"section_title": "Operator Age and Educational Attainment", "text": "One of the most striking characteristics of U.S. agriculture is the advanced age of principal farm operators compared with other self-employed workers. About 27 percent of farm operators report their age as 65 years or more (table 5) . In contrast, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimates that only 7 percent of self-employed workers in nonagricultural industries in 2003 were that old (U.S. Dept. Labor, 2004, p. 219) . 9 Each farm typeexcept residential/lifestyle-also had a substantially larger share of operators who were at least 65 years of age than was true for the nonfarm self-employed. Only 6 percent of all principal farm operators were under age 35.\nThe advanced age of farm operators is understandable, given that the farm is the home for most farmers and that farmers can phase out of farming gradually over a decade or more (Ahearn et al., 1993, p. 7) . Younger farmers enter the business a very slow rate, which tends to increase the average age for farmers as a whole. Improved health and advances in farm equipment allow farmers to farm later in life than in previous generations (Mishra et al., 2005, p. 14) .\nOperator age varies considerably by farm type. As one would expect, operators of retirement farms have the highest average age (69 years), and 94 percent are age 55 or more. Average ages for limited-resource and low-sales farms (62 years and 57 years, respectively) are high when compared with the averages for the other types of family farms. The limited-resource, retirement, and low-sales types each have a relatively large percentage of operators at least 65 years old."}, {"section_title": "15", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Structure and Finances of U.S. Farms: 2005 Family Farm Report / EIB-12", "text": "Economic Research Service/USDA 9 Nineteen percent of operators have retirement farms, but are still counted as farmers because they have sales of at least $1,000. BLS excludes these operators from their estimates, because they are not-technically speaking-in the labor force. Excluding these operators from the ARMS estimate to be consistent with BLS methodology lowers the portion of operators at least 65 years of age to 14 percent. This is still double the 7-percent BLS estimate.\nThe advanced age of farmers raises concerns about the exit of large numbers of farmers from agriculture in the near future and finding younger farmers to replace them (Gale, 2002, p. 30) . Finding replacement operators, however, may not be as hard as it seems. Older farmers can be replaced with younger farmers who will produce more on larger farms, and some replacement farmers already work as secondary operators on multiple-generation farms (Hoppe et al., 1996, p. 45; Gale, 1994, pp. 5, 34-35; Gale, RDP) .\nEducational attainment varies sharply by type of farm. Very few operators of limited-resource farms attended or completed college, compared with over half of residential/lifestyle farms. Educational attainment also increases with farm size. About 44 percent of medium-sales operators attended or completed college, a number that jumps to nearly 60 percent for operators of very large farms.\nEconomic Research Service/USDA Figure 6 (top panel) tracks the long-term trend in gross cash farm income (GCFI) using two alternative price deflators: the GDP chain-type price index and the farm Producer Price Index (PPI). 10 The GDP deflator measures the general level of prices in the economy, while the farm PPI measures the level of farm prices. Deflating with the GDP price index shows how the purchasing power of GCFI changes relative to the rest of the economy. Deflating with the farm PPI shows the real changing quantities of agricultural output underlying GCFI, independent of changes in general price levels.\nEconomic Research Service/USDA Deflating with the PPI, on the other hand, shows that the real value of production has trended upward since the late 1930s or early 1940s, despite declining farm numbers and relatively stable farmland acreage shown in figure 2. Increasing GCFI, by this measure, reflects a relatively steady longterm increase in farm productivity that began in 1937 (Cochrane, 1993, pp. 362-363) .\nand 37 percent of farms in each small-farm type had an operating profit margin of at least 10 percent in 2003. In addition, most farms in each smallfarm type generated a positive net farm income, although average net farm income was low compared with larger farms. For more information about small farms that perform well financially, see the 2004 Family Farm Report (Hoppe et al., 2005) .\nFinancial ratios. On average, limited-resource and residential/lifestyle farms had an operating expense ratio greater than 100 percent in 2003. In other words, operating expenses exceeded their gross cash farm income. The remaining small farms-retirement, low-sales, and medium-sales-generated enough income to cover expenses, although costs amounted to about 90 percent of gross cash farm income for retirement and low-sales farms. Farms with sales of at least $100,000-medium-sales small farms and largescale farms-had similar operating expense ratios, between 70 percent and 75 percent. A ratio at this level provided a larger margin between expenses and income than that experienced by retirement and low-sales small farms.\nFarms with annual sales of at least $100,000 have a higher debt-asset ratio than smaller family farms. As a result they are also more likely to be marginally solvent (positive net farm income, but with a debt-asset ratio above 40 percent). 11 In contrast, limited-resource, retirement, residential, and low-sales small farms were more likely to fall in the marginal-income category (negative net farm income, but with a debt-asset level of no more than 40 percent). This reflects their higher operating expense ratios, which means they are more likely to generate negative net income. Vulnerable farms, with negative net income and a debt asset-ratio more than 40 percent, are relatively rare in all farm types. In fact, most farms have a favorable financial position, regardless of farm type. Operating profit margin = 100% X (net farm income + interest -charge for unpaid operators' labor and management)/gross farm income. *** 1 Return on assets = (net farm income + interest -charge for unpaid operators' labor and management ) / total assets. 2 Return on equity = (net farm income -charge for unpaid operators' labor and management ) / net worth. 3 Operating profit margin = (net farm income + interest -charge for unpaid operators' labor and management ) / gross farm income. 4 Operating expense ratio = total cash operating expenses / gross cash farm income. 5 Debt-asset ratio = Total liabilities/total assets. 6 Financial performance classification based on farm income and debt-asset ratio:\n\u2022 Favorable: positive net farm income and debt-asset ratio no more than 40 percent.\n\u2022 Marginal-income: negative net farm income and debt-asset ratio no more than 40 percent \u2022 Marginal-solvency: positive net farm income and debt-asset ratio greater than 40 percent.\n\u2022 Vulnerable: negative net farm income and debt-asset ratio greater than 40 percent. \nEconomic Research Service/USDA \nEconomic Research Service/USDA Direct payments, counter-cyclical payments, loan deficiency payments, marketing loan gains, net value of commodity certificates, peanut quota buyout, milk income loss contract payments, etc.\nFarm Business Arrangements U.S. farms use a variety of business arrangements that link them to other firms and individuals. The extent of these linkages varies by farm type, but they include arrangements to access or control productive resources. The key to agricultural production is the control of assets, but control can be accomplished through renting land and other assets rather than through buying them. Similarly, farms can use hired labor, contract labor, or custom work rather than family labor. Farms may also link to other firms through marketing or production contracts to sell or otherwise remove the commodities they produce.\nEconomic Research Service/USDA 1 Share of farms that owns land is slightly higher than the sum of full owners and part owners in table 3. Farms owning a small share (less than 1 percent) of the land they operate are tenants in table 3, but are classified as owning land here. 2 Includes operations renting land free of charge, not shown separately. Farms may rent for both cash and shares. Thus the percent cash renting and percent renting for shares may total to more than the percent renting under any method. \nEconomic Research Service/USDA A contract is a legal agreement between a farm operator (contractee) and another person or firm (contractor) to produce a specific type, quantity, and quality of agricultural commodity.

For example, receipts from livestock marketing were consistently greater than those from crops from the late 1920s through the early 1970s. Between 1972 and 1974, by contrast, the crop share of GCFI grew from 39 percent to 55 percent, while the livestock share declined from 54 percent to 44 percent.

Small family farms nevertheless account for significant portions of specific commodities: hay, tobacco, cash grains (including soybeans), dairy products, and beef cattle.\nProduction has shifted toward very large family farms and nonfamily farms since the late 1980s, mainly from small farms with annual sales between $10,000 and $249,999 and, to a lesser extent, large family farms. Shifts in production away from small farms with sales between $10,000 and $249,999 are likely to continue.

For example, 88 percent of the 28,300 farms with sales of $1 million or more in 2003 were family operations ( fig. 15 ). In addition, direct ownership of million-dollar nonfamily farms by large, publicly held corporations is negligible and is likely to remain so.

In addition, some secondary operators on multiple-generation farms perform fairly specialized functions-such as marketing or field operations-and may not currently have the broad experience and skills necessary to take over a large farm.\nOn the other hand, relatively few replacement farm operators will be necessary for the larger, commercial-sized farms producing the bulk of farm products. The 2002 Census of Agriculture estimates that the 34,100 largest farms account for 50 percent of the sales of farm products, and the 143,500 largest farms account for 75 percent of sales (U.S. Dept.

Some farmers reported to ARMS that they were the only operator, but later reported that their spouses were also operators. The count of operators in ARMS was adjusted upward to include the spouses in these cases. (The Census of Agriculture did not ask if the spouse was as an operator, so the census count could not be adjusted.) Without the adjustment, the ARMS count of all operators falls within 1 percentage point of the count from the Census of Agriculture.

CPS self-employment income includes income received as cash, but excludes in-kind or nonmoney receipts. No adjustments are made to the CPS income measure to reflect inventory changes, since inventory change is a nonmoney item. The CPS definition departs from a strict cash concept by deducting depreciation, a noncash business expense, from the income of self-employed people.\nFarm self-employment income from the ARMS is the sum of the operator household's share of farm business income (net cash farm income less depreciation), wages paid to the operator, and net rental income from renting farmland. Adding other farm-related income of the operator household yields earnings of the operator household from farming activities.\n(Other farm-related earnings consist of net income from a farm business other than the one being surveyed, wages paid by the farm business to household members other than the operator, and commodities paid to household members for farm work.)\nARMS is also the source of data for estimates of operator households' net worth. The net worth of farm-operator households is defined as the difference between their assets and liabilities. It is calculated as the sum of the operator household's farm net worth and nonfarm net worth. If the net worth of the farm is shared with other households (such as the households of shareholders in a family corporation), only the operator household's share is included.
