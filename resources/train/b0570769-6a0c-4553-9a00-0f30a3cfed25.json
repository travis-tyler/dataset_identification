[{"section_title": "Preface", "text": "The NCES National Education Longitudinal Studies (NELS) program is a long-term effort that now encompasses the educational experience of youth from three decades the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. The general aim of the NELS program is to study the educational, vocational, and personal development of students at various grade levels, and the personal, familial, social, institutional, and cultural factors that may affect that development. The NELS program currently consists of three major studies: the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS-72); High School and Beyond of 1980(HS&B of 1980and the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88). While some school records data were collected by NLS-72, two of the NELS seriesHS&B in 1982 and NELS:88 in 1992include very specialized academic transcript data bases, that permit determinants, patterns, and consequences of course taking to be deeply explored. Transcripts were collected for 15,941 members of the HS&B 1980 sophomore cohort in the fall of 1982, and for 17,285 NELS:88 sample members in the fall of 1992. Also housed in NCES, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is a federallyfunded, on-going periodic assessment of educational achievement in the various subject areas and disciplines taught in the nation's schools. Since 1969, NAEP has gathered information about levels of educational achievement of 9-, 13-, and 17-year olds across the country. In the autumn of 1987, high school transcripts were collected from 34,140 students who, in 1985-86, were enrolled in the 11th grade and/or were 17 years old. These students attended 433 schools that had been sampled for NAEP in 1986. In the spring of 1991, high school transcripts were collected from 21,589 students who had graduated from the 1990 NAEP sample of 330 schools. These transcript studies permit course taking data to be linked to longitudinal questionnaire and test data in the case of HS&B and NELS:88, and to be linked to national assessment data in the case of the 1987 and 1990 NAEP studies. These linkages provide a means for assessing the relationship between course work and such learning outcomes as increased competence and knowledge. However, these four transcript studies also provide a basis for investigating changes in the pattern of course taking over time, as well as changes in enrollment associated with various student characteristics. In particular, such trend data permit analysts to investigate the impact of the curricular reforms of the 1980s, which stressed the need for major changes in program enrollment and graduation requirements in order to enhance the exposure of all students to essential materials and learning processes. Conducting cross-cohort comparisons using HS&B, NAEP, and NELS:88 academic transcript data The High School Transcript Studies. The immense value of school transcripts as objective, reliable measures of crucial aspects of students' educational experiences is widely recognized. With respect to level of detail, accuracy, and completeness, transcript data are vastly superior to student selfreports of exposure to learning situations.' When coupled with data on students' family backgrounds and demographic characteristics, school environments, and standardized competence and outcome measures,' they permit the specification of complex models of educational processes. Moreover, transcript components of longitudinal studies such as HS&B and NELS:88 permit the measurement of high school program and course effects on post-high school outcomes. Transcripts also provide indicator data for measuring national education trends. Of particular interest are changes in course taking and trends associated with grading practices and program placement and participation. NELS:88 and other NCES studies supply archival data on these topics. These studies include the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS-72), the sophomore cohort component of High School and Beyond (HS&B), and records studies of the high school careers of 1987 and 1990 graduating seniors conducted as part of the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Some additional secondary transcript studies have been carried out as well.' Although a separate transcript study was not conducted as part of NLS-72, school records data were collected. School administrators were asked to supply data on each NLS-72 senior's high school grade average, college admission test scores (SAT, ACT), courses taken, and major course of study. HS&B, the NAEP High School Transcript studies, and NELS:88unlike NLS-72are characterized by a formal school records component in which courses have been coded using the successive versions of the Classification of Secondary School Courses (CSSC). These data sets have been designed to serve a number of purposes, including trend comparison. In order to properly compare data across these studies, however, analysts must be sensitive to points of difference that may affect comparisons. In addition to issues of content comparability, there are issues of sample design comparability. Content comparability is addressed in the crosswalk which appears as the final section of this monograph. Design comparability is discussed below, followed by a bibliography of sources of information on the transcript studies. See, for example, Fetters, Stowe and Owings (1984) for a comparison of self-report and transcript data, drawn from High School and Beyond. 2 HS&B and NELS:88 transcript data are directly linkable to individual student test scores, questionnaire data, and contextual data sources such as teacher, parent, and school administrator reports, at multiple points in time. NAEP transcripts can be linked to NAEP public use assessment results, as well as to school questionnaire and school course offerings data."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "Educational Testing Service collected course completion data in the Study of Academic Prediction and Growth in 1969. Private school students were not included nor was this a national probability sample of public high school graduates; however, the study is thought to give reasonable public school estimates. The Bureau of Labor Statistics National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Force ExperienceYouth Cohort (NLSY), with sponsorship from the National Center for Research in Vocational Education, collected secondary school academic transcripts in three waves from 1980-83 for its sample of youths who were aged 14-21 in 1979; see NLS Handbook 1992, p. 138, p.147. Further information on both studies is given in Tuma, Gifford, Horn and Hoachlander (1989). Sample Comparability Across NCES High School Transcript Studies.The overall sample design for HS&B, NAEP, and NELS:88 is quite similar. All are large, nationally representative school-based samples that have employed a multistage, stratified, clustered design. Despite their fundamental similarity, the designs differ somewhat in a number of features. Five differences should be noted because of their potential impact on the matter, the manner, or the possibility of comparative analysis: school and student oversampling: different rare student populations and school types have been disproportionately included in the studies; Oversampling. Rare populations of high policy (or, as in the case of twins, methodological) interest were oversampled in some of the transcript studies. This factor, along with differences in overall sample size, mean that the number of cases available for analysis of rare populations may vary by a good deal across the studies. The 1987 NAEP high school transcript study oversampled handicapped students. Non-sampled co-twins of HS&B sampled twins were included in the transcripts component of the study. HS&B oversampled Hispanics; NELS:88 oversampled Asians and Hispanice; NAEP oversamples schools with high percentages of Hispanics and blacks. Private school students were oversampled in both HS&B and NELS:88, though the HS&B sample of non-Catholic private schools was comparatively small (31 non-Catholic private schools are included in the HS&B transcript study). Private school oversampling is also a feature of NAEP. Eligibility. Potential undercoverage biases resulting from sample exclusion are summarized in Table 1. \"Undercoverage\" here refers to systematic undercoverage stemming from deliberate exclusion of certain categories of students from a samplesuch as physically or mentally disabled students or non-English speakers, who might find it difficult or impossible to complete demanding cognitive tests and questionnaires. There are other potential sources of undercoverage as well, such as incomplete sampling frame data (no national listing of schools is, or remains for very long, 100 percent complete and accurate) or omissions and errors in school rosters.' HS&B, NAEP, and NELS:88 have excluded students with severe mental, physical, or linguistic obstacles to completing survey forms. While all three studies have used similar exclusion criteria, specific guidelines differ somewhat across (as well as, over time, within) the studies. In an effort to minimize the number of exclusions, eligibility criteria were modified (in large part, by being made more specific) starting with both the 1990 NAEP and 1990 NELS:88. Both NAEP and NELS:88 collect data on the characteristics of excluded students so that undercoverage bias can be quantified; detailed exclusion documentation is not available for HS&B. However, given the general similarity of eligibility rules for HS&B, NAEP, and NELS:88, one may presume on the basis of the NAEP and NELS:88 experience at the upper grade levels that HS&B base year exclusion rates were between 3 and 6 percent. Both NAEP and NELS:88 have been more inclusive in their transcript studies than in test or questionnaire administration. In NELS:88, all base year ineligible students who were seniors in the spring term of the 1992 school year were included in the transcript study. In the 1987 NAEP transcript study, the sample included (1) sample selections in the 1986 NAEP assessment, plus (2) students who were sampled for the assessment but deliberately excluded from it, and (3) all handicapped students attending schools selected for the assessment. Thus categories of students such as the handicapped, who were disproportionately excluded from the testing sample, were disproportionately selected (oversampled) for the transcript components, and additional information The distribution of these classifications in the school population may be the source of additional subgroup biases. For example, base year ineligibles differ from the eligible sample in terms of race/ethnicity (for example, disproportionate numbers of Hispanics), gender (disproportionate numbers of males), and behavioral characteristics, (for example, a much higher dropout rate). In the base year, 5.4% of the potential sample was excluded (since some excluded students proved, upon investigation, not to have been 1987-88 eighth graders, the apparent 5.4% rate in fact slightly overstates the proportion excluded). By the time of the second follow-up transcripts study in 1992, over half of the excluded students had been reclassified as eligible for NELS:88. collected about these students' disabilities. Inclusion of NAEP test-excluded students in the transcript studies also provides representation for language barrier ineligibles. The 1990 high school transcript study requested transcripts for both NAEP participating and nonparticipating NAEP sample members and excluded students (4.2 percent of seniors were excluded from the 1990 NAEP testing sample for reasons of mental, physical, or linguistic barriers to participation). While the NELS:88 transcript component provides extended coverage of the population of eligible and ineligible 1992 seniors, there is some sample undercoverage of the eighth and tenth grade cohorts, as documented in Chapter 3 of the student component data file users manual. Participation in special education or bilingual education is specifically noted in the NELS:88 transcript data (flag F2RSPFLG); English as a Second Language courses have distinct CSSC codes. A more difficult case is the HS&B transcript study, insofar as undercoverage in HS&B primarily of handicapped students, secondarily of students with limited English language proficiencyis not well documented. (For example, unknown numbers of handicapped students were excluded; others were included, but not identified as handicapped in a way comparable to the NAEP procedures). It may therefore be useful to provide an example to show how the HS&B secondary transcripts data can be manipulated to facilitate comparisons with NAEP for this category of students. Hoachlander dealt with the comparability problem in the following way (see Hoachlander, 1991). A fraction of handicapped students is included in HS&B; another fraction is excluded, usually those with more severe handicaps. Because the HS&B transcript study contains records for dropouts and repeating students who did not graduate with their classmates and whose transcripts were therefore incomplete, Hoachlander limited comparison to high school graduates. A second condition was set as wellcomparison students must have completed between 16 and 32 total Carnegie Units. Hoachlander remarks: These sample restriction rules also had the advantage of eliminating most of the moderately and severely handicapped graduates from the NAEP sample. When we examined the disabilities of the handicapped students remaining in the NAEP sample after the imposition of these rules, we found most of them to be only mildly learning disabled, mildly emotionally disabled, or mildly retarded. Given the rigor of the HS&B questionnaire, these are the kinds of disabled students who would most likely have been selected to participate yet not identified as handicapped. Altogether, the handicapped students remaining in the NAEP sample after the imposition of the sample restrictions accounted for about 3 percent of the total population of graduates. This approach to making the samples consistent proved to be a simple solution to the problems posed by the inclusion of handicapped students in HS&B without their having been identified as such. For the 1982-1990 tabulations of credits earned (Legum et al., 1993), analysis was restricted to NAEP transcripts sample members who had not participated in special education programs 8 HS&B provided for questionnaire self-identification of handicapped students; in NELS:88, eligible students with disabilities were identified (in the base year, hence for the eighth grade cohort only) by parents, while schools identified handicapped students who were ineligible to participate. In the NAEP High School Transcript Studies, handicapped students were defined as those for whom the school had on file a special education IEP (Individualized Educational Program). HS&B student self-reports of handicap status'were not highly stable over time (see Owings and Stocking, 1985). Transcript data on participation in special education programs serves as an additional identifier of handicap status (4.3% of the NELS:88 sample participated in special education programs, according to their transcripts, and 1.6% in bilingual education). For the NELS:88 transcripts component, special education courses were coded in conformity with the specifications of the 1987 and 1990 transcripts studies, which were more detailed than those of HS&B, though without a seventh-digit code extension (see 4.4.2 of the NELS:88 Second Follow-Up Transcript Component Data File User's Manual). Representative Populations. There are four basic questions to be asked about the NCES academic transcript studies in terms of their degree of representativeness of various national populations. These questions are: 1) Was the school sample nationally representative? 2) Is the within-school student sample representative of an age or grade cohort within the school? 3) Was the student sample nationally representative?"}, {"section_title": "4) Of what was it representative?", "text": "We shall answer each of these questions in turn. 1) Was the school sample nationally representative? HS&B and the NAEP transcript studies were based on national probability samples of high schools. The HS&B school sample is representative of the nation's high schools in 1980. Technically it is not representative of the nation's schools in 1982 since new high schools came into existence and some 1980 schools merged and closed. Given the low rate of such change over a two year period, the 1982 HS&B schools are a close approximation of a national probability sample of schools. It should also be remembered that transcripts are inherently longitudinalthey span the several years of the high school career from 1979 or 1980 to 1982. Hence the HS&B transcript study may best be described as a collection of the high school records of a representative sample of the nation's 1980 sophomores from within a nationally representative sample of 1980 high schools. The 1987 NAEP transcripts are based on the nationally representative school sample of the 1986 NAEP. This point of perfect school representativeness falls midway in the transcript record, with the 1986 sample a good approximation to the nation's schools in 1985 or 1987. The 1990 NAEP transcript study is a nationally representative sample of schools derived from the 1990 NAEP sample. However, while the NAEP sample frame included all schools teaching grade 12 or having 17-year-old students (that is, individuals born in 1972) in the 1989-90 school year, the transcript study was restricted to schools with twelfth grades. The NELS:88 high school sample is not nationally representative. It represents the schools to which a national probability sample of eighth graders had dispersed two and four years later. 2) Is the within-school student sample representative of an age or grade cohort within the school? The HS&B sample is fully representative of sophomores in the HS&B school in the spring term of the 1979-80 school year. It not fully representative thereafter, because transfers into the school had no chance of selection into the HS&B follow-up sample. (Though transfers into HS&B schools are not represented in the 1982 survey, HS&B maintained a representative student sample overall by following transfers out of the H8&B schools.) The 1987 high school transcript sample originated in a within-school representative sample of the school's juniors/17-year-olds (that is, students born between October 1, 1968 and September 30, 1969). However, subsequent transfers into the school were given no chance of selection into the study; this fact qualifies the representativeness of the within-school sample of the graduating class of 1987. .14 The 1990 high school transcript sample originated within the 1990 NAEP sample of seniors /17year -olds, but is further restricted to the grade cohort of seniors who in fact graduated in calendar 1990. As such it provides a representative sample of each high school's 1990 graduates. NELS:88 in-school samples are not necessarily representative of seniors or graduating seniors within the NELS:88 schools, since, among other reasons, non-NELS:88 eighth grades as well as NELS:88 eighth grades may have fed the school. 3) Was the student sample nationally representative? All four studies provide nationally representative samples of public and private school students. However, there are some differences in the precise populations that are represented, as detailed in 4) below. 4) Of what was it representative? Table 2 summarizes the analysis populations associated with the various transcripts samples: HS&B is a nationally representative sample of 1980 sophomores, and of the 1980 sophomore cohort two years later (in 1982) when the HS&B transcript survey was conducted for a subsample of the sophomore cohort. Technically, the study imperfectly represents the nation's 1982 graduating seniors, since 1982 seniors who were not sophomores in 1980 are not represented in the sample. However, analysts can make adjustments for unrepresented seniors by modeling the characteristics of high school graduates who take more than the standard four (or three) years to complete. The 1987 High School Transcript Study represents an augmented sample of participants in the 1986 NAEP who were enrolled in the 11th grade and/or were 17 years old and who successfully completed their graduation requirements prior to fall 1987. While this sample is dominantly 1985-86 juniors, no attempt was made to follow individuals who left the school through transfer or dropping out, nor were juniors/seniors who transferred into the school after NAEP sampling included. In addition, 1987 graduating seniors who were not 1986 juniors had no chance of selection into the study. This sample therefore only approximates the high school graduating class of 1987. The 1990 High School Transcript Study is a representative sample of graduating seniors from the NAEP sample (participants, nonparticipants, and excluded students) in twelfth grade in the 1989-90 school year. As in the 1987 study, students who transferred out, failed to graduate on time, or who received GEDs, were excluded. The NELS:88 transcript survey represents several populations. First, it represents the nation's high school seniors in the spring term of 1992. To make comparisons, say to the NAEP 1990 sample, one must select only those NELS:88 senior cohort members who in fact graduated from high school with their class. Second, the NELS:88 transcript survey represents the nation's 1990 sophomores two years later. The sophomore cohort two years later includes both students and dropouts. NELS:88 transcript data can also be used cross-sectionally by generalizing about the sophomore cohort in spring term 1990 using transcripts data from the 1989-90 school year. Third, the NELS:88 transcript survey represents the nation's 1988 eighth graders four years later. Again, this population includes dropouts, early graduates, students who graduated in 1992, and students who failed to graduate with their class. For purposes of intercohort comparison, however, analysis populations of interest are likely to be somewhat more limited. Table 3 indicates principal cross-cohort comparisons employing NELS:88, HS&B, and NAEP (1987 and 1990) high school transcripts. Sample Sizes. There are differences in sample sizes across the studies, and marked differences in the distribution of transcripts-eligible students across schools. For example, HS&B collected 15,941 transcripts from 1,720 schools.' In contrast, the NAEP 1987 study collected more than twice as many transcripts (over 34,000) from a quarter as many schools (433). For the four academic transcript studies, numbers of schools providing data and numbers of transcripts obtained are summarized in Table 4. Completeness of the High School Record. The longitudinal studies (HS&B, NELS:88) followed a pre-senior cohort, collecting transcripts at the point at which sample members in modal grade progression had just completed their senior year. A fundamental difference between the HS&B and NELS:88 transcript studies and the NAEP high school transcript studies is that in the 1987 and 1990 NAEP records collections, transcripts of students who were still enrolled in school, dropouts, transfers, and individuals who received GEDs were excluded from the study, while in HS&B and NELS:88 they were included. Owing to the fact that some HS&B and NELS:88 sample members had fallen behind the modal sequence for their cohort, and that others had dropped out of school, school records for these individuals necessarily span less than a full high school career (for NELS:88, senior year transcripts are available for 14,789 of the 17,285 transcript participants). The tendency to take more than four years to complete high school (or to drop out) is not randomly distributed, but rather, is associated with specific 9 The target sample comprised 18,427 members of the sophomore cohort in 1,899 schools (the HS&B regular sample of about 1,000 schools, plus another 900 schools to which sophomores had transferred since the 1980 base year).  (1982,1987,1990,1992) 1982 sample is 1980 sophomores who graduated in 1982; for NELS:88, determine graduating seniors through F2RTROUT; for HS&B use RESNLEFT in conjunction with YEARLEFT; for 1987 NAEP, employ the variable EXSTAT. NAEP 1990 files contain graduating seniors only."}, {"section_title": "10", "text": "For HS&B, FUSTTYPE, and for NELS:88, F2DOSTAT, were imported into the transcript file from the student and dropout questionnaire files. F2DOSTAT characterizes the status of both participants and nonparticipants. Transcript data are missing for some dropout questionnaire completers, and transcript data are available for some dropout survey nonparticipants. In addition, there are some cases of disagreement between transcript-reported. outcomes and F2DOSTAT. (An additional indicator, F2TRSTYP, attempts to elucidate contradictions between transcript-and survey-defined enrollment status where such inconsistencies are merely apparent, and to force resolution of cases where inconsistencies between sources cannot be resolved on the basis of the information available from this survey wave [of course, relevant further information may be collected in the third follow-up)). Finally, 87 individuals appear on the transcript file with an imputed spring term 1992 dropout status (left school, receiving no alternative instruction and have not received equivalency certification); these individuals were survey nonparticipants and were therefore not weighted as dropouts for purposes of a final weight in the student and dropout components, but do have a transcript weight. In order to generate precise spring term 1992 dropout population estimates using F2TRSCWT, it is therefore necessary to employ F2WTSTAT to identify dropouts. The definitional mapping between F2WTSTAT and F2DOSTAT is: F2WTSTAT 3 = F2DOSTAT 3, 4, or 5. For a full accounting in accordance with student survey enrollment dispositions for the transcript file, see the universe variable F2UNIV2D; for transcript-reported dropout status see F2RTROUT or F2RREASL. Another source of incomplete school records in HS&B and NELS:88 arises from the fact that longitudinal cohort members often changed schools between the time they entered high school and the autumn 1992 transcripts data collection. While every attempt was made to collect transcripts from all secondary schools an individual had attended, both HS&B and NELS:88 experienced lower cooperation rates from the high schools that were not part of their regular sample, with the result that transcripts for transfer students are more likely to be incomplete than collections based on graduating seniors."}, {"section_title": "Other Differences of Note", "text": "Course Offerings File. For HS&B and the 1987 and 1990 NAEP studies, course titles and their CSSC codes for all offerings recorded in the school's course catalogue are available in a separate data file that can be used in conjunction with transcript data. For NELS:88, a course offerings file is in preparation for a subset of the NELS:88 1990-92 schools that are part of the School Effectiveness Study. There will also be a separate transcripts file for the NELS:88 School Effectiveness Study. For this component, students were added to a subsample of urban and suburban NELS:88 schools in the 30 largest MSAs, to provide representative and robust within-school student samples, for the study of school effects. A weight will be available for School Effectiveness Study schools. Definition of a Senior. There is a difference between comparing seniors in a given academic year, and comparing graduates in that year. NLS-72, HS&B in 1980, andNELS:88 in 1992 provide senior cohorts, not all members of which succeeded in meeting graduation requirements. There is also a difference between looking at graduates within an academic year (say 1989-90 or 1991-92) and within a calendar year. Sonie of these differences may need to be taken into account in comparative analyses. The transcripts data sets generally provide information about both the date and the reason for leaving the school so that commonality of unit of analysisfor example, graduates as of a certain time pointcan be maintained."}, {"section_title": "11", "text": "For example, Hayward and Thorne (1990) report that only 68 percent of disabled (compared to 87 percent of nondisabled) students graduate on time, Identification of Seniors and of Graduating Seniors. In HS&B, the 1980 sophomore cohort was not freshened to create a representative 1982 senior cohort; moreover, dropouts and non-seniors are included on the transcripts files. However, students were asked on the student questionnaire what grade they were in, and course-taking histories appear in the transcripts. Graduating seniors (12,738 of the 15,941 transcripts cases) can be identified by the \"reason left school\" variable on the transcripts file; date of separation from the school is also provided (\"month left\" and \"year left\" are provided). NELS:88 defined the senior cohort as all students enrolled in twelfth grade in the spring term of the 1992 school year; a special flag marks members of the senior cohort. Some members of the senior class fail to graduate. As in HS&B, these individuals can usually be identified in the transcripts file, which includes a \"transcript-indicated outcome\" variable (F2RTROUT) that differentiates between dropouts, individuals who are still enrolled, and spring 1992, other 1992, and pre-1992 graduates. NELS:88 mailed transcripts requests in mid-August, 1992. Although numbers of late year graduates are usually quite small, given the data collection schedule, graduation information may have been missed for some NELS:88 sample members graduating in the last quarter of calendar 1992. The HS&B transcript study was conducted within a similar time frame and limitations. Seniors were not, technically speaking, the focus of the 1987 NAEP study, for which the population of interest was students enrolled in 11th grade and/or 17 years old in the 1985-86 school year who had remained in their schools for the 1986-87 school year and had become part of the high school graduating class of 1987. Transcripts were collected in October and November of 1987. Student exit status is provided on the file. The 1990 NAEP sample was specifically limited to graduating seniorsa senior was defined as anyone graduating between January 1 and December 31, 1990 (data were not collected until 1991).
