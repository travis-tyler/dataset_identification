The following risk factors for CAD were considered for each patient history: (1) Hypercholesterolemia, defined as a total cholesterol level > 200 mddl on two or more blood measurements; (2) diabetes mefitus, defined as hyperglycemiarequiring medication; and (3) arterial hypertension, defined as either systolic or diastolic blood pressure elevation requiring ongoing therapy."}, {"section_title": "Transesophageal Echocardiographic Study", "text": "Comprehensive transthoracic echocardiographic examination was performed initially in all patients and was followed by the transesophageal study. The equipment used was either a Toshiba SSH 350 A or 160A device (Toshiba Medical System, Crawley, U.K.) with a 2.5 and 3.75 MHz transducer for the transthoracic and a 5 MHz multiplane transducer for the transesophageal examination, or a Hewlett Packard Sonos 2500 device (Hewlett-Packard, Inc., Andover, Mass., USA). Pharyngeal anesthesia was achieved with lidocaine spray, and light intravenous sedation was given with midazolame (2 mg) in 106 patients and meperidine (10 mg) in all patients. After cardiac examination, the transducer was rotated posteriorly to obtain thoracic aortic images. Particular attention was paid to obtaining optimal echocardiographic images, using multiplane imaging from the ascending to the descending aorta. Blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiogram (ECG) were also monitored. All studies were recorded on super VHS videotape for subsequent review and analysis. The criterion used to diagnose atherosclerotic lesions was the presence of distinct, localized, highly echogenic masses protruding into the vessel lumen. Intra-aortic atherosclerotic lesions were graded on a scale of I to II as we have described previously9 (Fig. 1). Specifically, the thoracic aorta was considered normal, without atherosclerotic lesions, when the intimal surface was smooth and continuous without lumen irreg-ularities or increased echodensity. Focal or linear regions of increased echodensity, slightly elevated above the surface of the intima, were findings consistent with grade I. Grade I1 changes consisted of intimal thickening and lumen irregularities associated with echodense material that induced shadow artifacts and sometimes presented a degree of mobility. Echocardiographically visualized atherosclerotic lesions and their distribution within the entire thoracic aorta were classified by the investigator and reviewed by a second experienced observer who was blinded to the patient's history.

Epidemiologic studies,14 based on a history of ischemic heart disease or on the resting ECG, have shown that the prevalence of CAD rises from 2 to 30% with increasing age. However, necropsy studies of elderly patients have found a 5040% prevalence of CAD, emphasizing the high incidence of undetected or latent CAD in this p0pu1ation.l~~ l6 Occult CAD can be diagnosed by applying a stress to the cardiovascular system. In patients who participated in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging,17 using the usual resting criteria, the prevalence of CAD varied between 13 and 22%. When stress criteria were added, either by a treadmill exercise stress or by an abnormal exercise thallium scan, the CAD prevalence doubled. l8 It is therefore apparent that the diagnosis of CAD in the older population is important and that care should be taken to rule it out even in asymptomatic individuals. Although the standard of reference for diagnosing significant CAD is coronary angiography, much attention has been given to establishing a safe, noninvasive method for the detection of CAD. Several studies have demonstrated that, as shown by chest x-ray, the early presence of calcified lesions in the thoracic aorta is independently associated with excess cardiovascular disease.6 However, the low resolution of x-ray studies limits the possibility of detecting atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta and drawing logical conclusions about the coexistence of CAD. Recent improvements in noninvasive imaging techniques, especially in ultrasound technology, have allowed for more reliable detection of atherosclerotic lesions in the thoracic aorta using a transesophageal approach, which offers high-resolution imaging for evaluation of diseases of the thoracic aorta. l9 In this study we found that the presence of atherosclerotic plaque in the thoracic aorta, detected by TEE, is a sensitive predictor of obstructive CAD in patients < 70 years old, while in patients 270 years of age it lacks sensitivity. Important, however, is that we found a high negative predictive value in both groups of patients, aged either < or 270 years. This means that the absence of atherosclerotic plaque in the thoracic aorta is a significant predictor of normal coronary arteries in all patients regardless of age. In practice, in patients aged 270 years, the presence of atherosclerotic plaque in the thoracic aorta, detected by TEE, failed to be an independent predictor of significant coronary artery stenosis, while in younger patients it was a strong predictor of CAD. Only a few studies have investigated the ability of TEE to predict CAD using the presence of atherosclerotic lesions in the thoracic aorta in the elderly population, and these have had conflicting results. Matsumura ef al. I2 showed that the detection of atherosclerotic lesions in the thoracic aorta by TEE is not useful in predicting significant CAD in elderly patients, but is a strong predictor in patients < 70 years. In contrast, Tribouilloy etaL21 found that aortic plaque is a significant independent predictor of significant CAD, even in patients 2 70 years old, although their patients had a higher overall inci-dence of CAD than did ours. Both these studies agree that the absence of atherosclerotic lesions is a powerful predictor of a lack of coronary artery stenosis. Fazio et al.22 also reported that detection of atherosclerotic plaque in the thoracic aorta by TEE showed high sensitivity and specificity for obstructive CAD; however, the significance of aortic plaque in elderly patients was not reported in detail. Of all additional risk factors we examined in patients < 70 years old, the presence of atherosclerotic plaque in the thoracic aorta (p<O.OOl) was an independent predictor for coronary artery stenosis, while diabetes mellitus was of marginal significance (p = 0.05); in patients 170 years old, the only independent predictor was the presence of grade I1 atherosclerotic lesions. It is interesting that hypertension was related to the presence of thoracic aorta atherosclerosis (p < 0.001) in patients aged < 70 years, while in patients aged 2 70 years only diabetes mellitus was related to a lesser degree (p = 0.07). These findings are in agreement with those of Khoury et al.* and Nishino et al. ,23 who found that hypertension and diabetes mellitus were significantly related to thoracic aorta atherosclerosis. However, both these studies referred to the general population and neither classified patients according to age."}, {"section_title": "Clinical Implications", "text": "Atherosclerotic lesions in the thoracic aorta are a good marker for the detection of coronary artery stenosis in patients < 70 years of age, but were less useful in the elderly patients (I 70 years) of our study. However, the absence of such lesions rules out the possibility of significant disease in all patients. These results should be taken into account for risk stratification in elderly, asymptomatic patients. Other modalities, such as stress tests, stress echocardiography, or pharmacologic thallium imaging, may be used when ischemic heart disease is suspected in patients aged I 7 0 years. Since age is a major risk factor for CAD, coronary angiography is usually performed in elderly patients scheduled for valve surgery. However, this is not always the case for younger patients, and TEE could serve as a screening examination for patients aged < 70 years. Even in older patients, though, the absence of aortic plaque on TEE could perhaps be added to the criteria for deciding not to perform coronary arteriography. Transesophageal echocardiography may also be helpful in avoiding complications when a patient is evaluated for angiography. Arterial embolism arising from aortic atherosclerotic lesions has been described as occurring spontaneously or following invasive procedures involving the aorta, such as catheterization or surgery.20"}, {"section_title": "Limitations of the Study", "text": "We did not examine other risk factors such as smoking or family history for CAD, but this was not the main aim of our study. It is possible that we have underestimated the incidence of atherosclerotic plaques on the upper portion of the ascend-ing aorta because of the interposition of the trachea; however, we believe that the use of the multiplane probe has reduced this inconvenience. Although the whole study sample was satisfactorily large, the group of patients I 70 years old was limited. A prospective study with a large group of elderly patients is needed to conf i r m our observations."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The transesophageal echocardiographic analysis of atherosclerotic lesions in the thoracic aorta can provide valuable information regarding the presence of significant CAD only in patients < 70 years old. However, in patients of all ages, the absence of atherosclerotic lesions in the thoracic aorta seems to be a specific marker for the absence of significant coronary artery stenosis; this information may be useful in the noninvasive assessment of elderly patients at risk of CAD."}]
