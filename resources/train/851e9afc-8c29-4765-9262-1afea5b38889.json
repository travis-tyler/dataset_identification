[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Human capital 1 is considered to be the engine of economic growth 2 and there exist several models that seek to explain this. Nelson (2005) has condensed these into two schools of thought: accumulation theories and assimilation theories. The first envisage a direct effect of human capital on labour productivity as an explicit factor of production embodied in effective labour. This approach suggests that it is new investment in human capital that matters for growth. The second school of thought explores the relation between the level of human capital and total factor productivity growth or technological change; the emphasis here is on the link between human capital and disembodied knowledge as manifested in technology. The accumulation of human capital is highlighted by the former school while it is the stock of human capital that is important in the latter; what Dowrick (2003) calls growth effects and level effects respectively.\nAssimilationist theories have emerged as a synthesis of two ideas. One is that greater understanding of the role knowledge and skills play can shed light on the process of technology growth. This draws on earlier insights on the link between R&D, innovation and market value in Schumpeter (1934) and Griliches (1981) and is central in models of endogeneous growth highlighting the role of innovation and sustainable growth (Romer 1990; Aghion and Howitt 1998) ."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "The second idea highlights knowledge externalities as the source of spillovers from technology leaders to less developed countries. However, the adoption of foreign technology depends on the 'absorptive capacity' of the imitator (Wolff, 2001; Falvey, Foster, and Greenaway 2007) . Human capital is a key determinant of absorptive capacity since it enables workers to understand and assimilate new technology; a particular formulation of the convergence process whereby less developed economies catch-up with the developed world. 4 The idea originates in Nelson and Phelps (1966) who assessed education to be a catalyst in the diffusion of new technologies. Their model rests on two key assumptions: the further away an economy is from the technology frontier, the greater the potential rate of catching up;\nand the larger the human capital the bigger is the capability to learn and adopt the new technology. Benhabib and Spiegel (1994) integrate the two ideas in a generalised model that attempts to explain both innovation and technology diffusion. The model builds on the intuition that the two views of human capital are complementary, for they explain different stages of economic development; i.e., nations closer to the technology frontier have accumulated high levels of human capital that could support innovation while countries far from the frontier focus on technology diffusion."}, {"section_title": "5", "text": "Although intuitively appealing, the original Nelson-Phelps hypothesis, suggests that the imitation of foreign technology is always beneficial since workers can 'follow and understand new technological developments' (Nelson and Phelps 1966, p.69) .\nMoreover, the hypothesis implies that a backward economy could develop rapidly by simply relying on human capital and imitation. As acknowledged by Benhabib and Spiegel (2005) , this seems to ignore barriers to free-riding and absorption of new technology. In particular, it contradicts Schumpeter (1934) and economic intuition that emphasise the role of intellectual property rights.\nNew evidence in the 1990s motivated further progress in assimilationist theory.\nFirst, the Solow 'residual' or total factor productivity (hereafter TFP) explained most of the cross-country differences in growth rates. Second, per capita incomes for a number of countries seemed to diverge rather than converge. 6 Third, substantial investment in education failed to insulate less developed countries (LDCs) from stagnation (Pritchett, 2001) . In order to account for the above limitations, Benhabib and Spiegel (2005) extend the Nelson-Phelps model 7 by considering a logistic diffusion process that allows for impediments to imitation and divergence in world income. In a cross-sectional empirical application, the authors find the logistic diffusion model to be superior to the exponential model of Benhabib and Spiegel (1994) in explaining world income growth patterns. Further, the authors identify a number of countries at risk of falling into poverty traps.\nThe principal objective of this paper is to re-examine the Benhabib and Spiegel (2005) model of logistic diffusion with two key innovations. First, the paper utilises a new measure of human capital that focuses on the complementarity between skills acquired through schooling and IT equipment related facilitating the application of cognitive skills. In brief, the new human capital index is a composite latent index of three key indicators: the share of the adult population who have completed secondary education; per capita scientific research output in science, and per capita trade in IT educational equipment. This rests on the idea that technological growth requires both cognitive skills and their application at the workplace. IT educational equipment reveals the degree to which cognitive skills are employed by the adult population. Also, we relax the assumption of a Cobb-Douglas production function to consider two alternative forms: the constant-elasticity of substitution (CES) function of Duffy, Papageorgiou, and Perez-Sebastian (2004) , and the translog production function of Papageorgiou and Chmeralova (2005) . These extentions are motivated by mounting evidence in favour of capital-skill complementarities (CSC) and skill-biasedtechnical-change (SBTC). Finally, the paper employs both dynamic panel data and cross-sectional data econometrics to gain insights on the dynamic relation between human capital and growth, and to address concerns associated with measurement errors."}, {"section_title": "9", "text": "The paper is structured as follows. Section two traces the evolution of technology diffusion theory and outlines three key models. Section three presents the new latent index of human capital and tests its reliability. Section four reports the estimation results in testing the logistic diffusion model of Benhabib and Spiegel (2005) . Section five conducts sensitivity analysis and section six and concludes.\n8 By convention, the term 'production technology' refers to the form of the production function, in contrast to the term 'technology' that stands for total factor productivity, TFP. 9 For a review of growth econometrics issues, see Durlauf, Johnson and Temple (2005) ."}, {"section_title": "Knowledge Diffusion: Three Models", "text": "In general, theories of human capital and growth define output, Y, to be of the general functional form: where Y j, t is per capita output in country j in period t, A represents technology being a function of human capital, H, and X 1 , \u2026, X n are n factors of production that may also include H.\nAssimilationist theories focus on A. Here, we outline three models of technology diffusion with a Cobb-Douglas production function, as first proposed. For brevity, we drop the country indicator that is implicit. We begin with the Benhabib and Spiegel (1994) model with the production function: \nHere, h t is the natural logarithm of H t , and g, m >0. 10 In this equation, the first term represents domestic innovation and the second term is the Nelson and Phelps (1966) idea of technological diffusion being the product of a country's level of human capital (i.e., absorptive capacity) and the 'distance to the frontier' (i.e., the gap between the technological level of a leading country, max t A , and that of the home country, A t ). Benhabib and Spiegel (1994) take the log difference of (1) and substitute for (2) to arrive at the growth equation: 10 Benhabib and Spiegel (1994) specify H t instead of h t and then equate H t with educational attainment. We draw on Krueger and Lindahl (2001) and adopt the Mincer approach to specifying human capital as an exponential function of schooling. The end result is the same since in this study it is h t that equates with educational attainment in all three models.\nwhere y t , k t and l t are Y t , K t and L t in logs respectively. Equation (3) predicts that, in addition to growth in physical capital and labour, \uf044k and \uf044l, economic growth will also depend on the stock of human capital and the distance to the frontier; u t is a serially correlated error term. Note, technology diffusion is an exponential process;\ni.e., countries further away from the frontier catch-up faster than those closer, and any country in some distance from the frontier could specialise in imitation without any R&D effort (Jones, 2008) . Further, the model also implies that imitation could be more beneficial than innovation for countries closer to the frontier, as long as the distance to the frontier is greater than (g-m)/m.\nIn a second model, Dowrick and Rogers (2002) propose a model that is different to Benhabib and Spiegel (1994) in three ways. First, it accounts for growth effects by allowing human capital to enter as a direct factor of production. Second, although it maintains Nelson and Phelps' (1966) \nCompared to the exponential model in (2), diffusion in (5) is moderated by the inverse of the distance to the frontier, also known as 'backwardness', (A/A max ). As a result, the innovation effect of human capital is relatively larger and the catch-up process is slower when the country is very far or very close to the frontier."}, {"section_title": "A New Index of Human Capital", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Due to data limitations, existing international studies on the role of human capital in technology diffusion have overwhelmingly adopted educational attainment as a proxy for human capital.\n13 Spiegel (2005, 1994) and Dowrick and Rogers (2002) Benhabib and Spiegel (2005) . It nests two limiting cases: the exponential diffusion model of Benhabib and Spiegel (1994) when s=-1, and the logistic model when and s=1. On the basis of the evidence in Benhabib and Spiegel (2005) , this study considers only these two scenarios. 13 It is only recently that alternative, broader definitions have surfaced in the empirical literature. Hanushek and W\u00f6\u00dfmann (2009; and Jones (2008) emphasise cognitive skills while Aghion, Howitt and Murtin (2010) highlight the role of health. 14 Note, existing panel studies employ data that pre-dates 1990 and so do other diffusion models such as Acemoglu, Aghion and Zilibotti (2006) . The study by Aghion, Howitt and Murtin (2010) is an exception, though it does not employ educational attainment as a measure of human capital and only OECD countries are considered in system GMM estimation. 15 For a review of measurement errors in the estimation of educational attainment, see Cohen and Soto (2007) . This literature is beyond the scope of this study. 16 These problems have been well documented in Bils and Klenow (2000) , W\u00f6\u00dfmann (2003) , Le, Gibson, and Oxley (2003) , Abowd et al. (2005) , and Joss (2001 (Romer 2000) , the variable is also susceptible to reverse causality (Bils and Klenew 2000) and appropriate instruments are hard to find at the national level (Vandenbussche, Aghion, and Meghir 2005; Aghion et al. 2009 ).\nAn alternative account invokes the Mincerian approach to human capital that seeks to decipher two key insights. One is that human capital is a composite index of cognitive skills acquired at school, and the net effect of work experience, training and skill depreciation. Moreover, the current market value of these skills can vary over time and across nations. 18 This is the general methodology employed here at the macro-level to account for the quality of education (i.e., cognitive skills).\nThe potential discrepancy between education and skills has been emphasised in various forms. One expression is Sen's (1997) distinction between 'human capital'\nand 'human capability' where the latter emphasises 'functionings' (i.e., outcomes and achievements) that enable people to participate in markets and adapt to change (Lanzi, 2007) . Another is the 'knowing-doing gap' that Joss (2001) describes as the 'ability to implement what is known' and not abstract knowledge. The innovation literature also pays attention to a balance between the 'body of practice' and the 'body of understanding' as key to explaining knowledge transfer (Nelson, 2005) . Finally, the gap between schooling and skills is implicit in the literature of job training (Borghans and Heijke, 2005; Nordman and Wolff, 2007; Destre, Levy-Garboua, and Sollogoub, 2008; Robst, 2007) .\n17 Hanushek and W\u00f6\u00dfmann (2007) and the skill decomposition approaches are two interpretations of why education failed to stimulate growth in less developed countries (Pritchett 2001) . The latter approach suggests that a single indicator of human may be limiting when assessing the human capitaldiffusion nexus. 18 This is the approach adopted by Krueger and Lindahl (2001) and Abowd et al. (2005) . See Folloni and Vittadini (2010) for a comprehensive survey of alternative methodologies in the measurement of human capital. Hanushek and Kimko (2000) depart from quantitative measures of education to jointly consider quantitative and qualitative indicators in growth equations. They find that international test scores of student achievement in mathematics and science, TIMSS, are significant predictors of growth. Coulombe, Tremblay, and Marchand (2004) and W\u00f6\u00dfmann (2009, 2007) In this section, we consider human capital as a composite index that jointly accounts for the following key dimensions of human capital: cognitive skills acquired at school, cognitive skills used in scientific research, and the employment of modern educational IT equipment as complementary to cognitive skills. Hence, the new index seeks to measure cognitive skills as currently employed by the adult population."}, {"section_title": "22", "text": "In an exhaustive literature survey on the history of human capital measurement, Folloni and Vittadini (2010) strongly recommend the search for human capital as a latent variable. They maintain that the approach is in the spirit of Schultz' (1961) emphasis on 'knowledge and skills that have economic value'. The emphasis on value is in the light of (a) time-varying returns to education (Psacharopoulos and Patrinos, 2004; Hartog and Oosterbeek, 2007) ; (b) the importance of skill obsolescence (Alders, 2005; Gorlich and de Grip, 2007; Pfeiffer and Reu\u00df, 2007) , and (d) evidence of skill-job mismatch and overeducation (Cheng and Ghulam, 2007; Korpi and 19 In contrast, Jones and Schneider (2006) and Jones (2008) utilise the cross-section international IQ test scores published by Lynn and Vanhanen (2002) . 20 An early but brief observation of the skills deficit in developing countries was by Tsoukalas (1976) . His data clearly show that less developed Southern European countries in 1960 had markedly lower rates of tertiary student enrolments in applied sciences and technology than the more advanced OECD economies. 21 L\u00e9vy-Garboua et al. (2004) challenge the idea that test scores are good indicators of human capital. They call for a return to the notion of 'market value of school outputs'. 22 Ciccone and Papaioannou (2005) and Vandenbussche, Aghion and Meghir (2006) suggest that a single indicator of human may be limiting when assessing the impact of human capital on innovation and diffusion. Note, however, that these studies have utilised traditional measures of schooling. Tahlin, 2007) . Further, several studies have also proposed the latent factor approach as a strategy in dealing with measurement errors and endogeneity. 23 We exploit new data not available to Hanushek and Kimko (2000) and Dagum and Slottje (2000) in order to estimate a new index of human capital as an unobservable latent factor that measures the level of skills acquired in secondary education that are employed by the adult population; we maintain that this composite index measures the level of cognitive skills employed by the adult population. Hanushek and Kimko (2000) utilise international test scores in maths and science (TIMSS) to impute crosssection measures of cognitive skills from regressions, assuming that quality of schooling evolves slowly over time. Dagum and Slottje (2000) estimate human capital as a latent variable using household survey data. However, none of these indicators are direct measures of intelligence or education quality (Le, Gibson, and Oxley 2003) .\nWe utilise a multiple-indicator model with one latent common factor:\nI k,jt is the log of indicator k=1,\u2026,n of country j at time t, h S is the common factor, \uf06c k is the factor loading, and e k is an idiosyncratic error term. The common factor is the unobserved characteristic of cognitive skills that drives the n indicators. In search for appropriate indicators, we consider variables that proxy several dimensions of applied cognitive skills by the adult population. We select the following three series, in logs:\nthe share of the adult population who completed secondary education, SECO, per capital scientific publications in science, SciP, and per capita trade in research IT equipment, RITE. 24 The use of secondary education as a key indicator is suggested by Rogers (2008) and is highly relevant in this study where the emphasis is on research skills. Persons who have completed secondary education are expected to have acquired basic research skills that are critical for frontier research as well as understanding new technology. It also seems intuitive that the SciP bibliometrics measure would reflect the quality of human research capital. Gault (2005) argues that the process of knowledge creation -closely interlinked with technological progressby academic scientist can be measured by academic publications. Finally, RITE is to acknowledge the importance of information technology as key in the application of cognitive skills and research. The focus on educational IT also rests on economic intuition of a link between trade and skilled human capital (Galor and Weil, 2000) and the importance of trade as a means to technology transfer (Apergis, Economidou, and Fillipidis, 2009; Madsen, 2007) . Here, however, we focus on trade of IT equipment that directly relates to cognitive skills, research capacity and, thus, the quality of education.\nSECO and SciP contain information on cognitive skills while RITE contributes information on the level of applied research skills. The existence of a single principal factor common to all three indicators is likely to measure cognitive skills that have economic value. We acknowledge that the single index approach adopted here may be limiting if the role of human capital in innovation and diffusion can only be captured by multiple measures of human capital. Also, to the extent that the new single latent factor captures an effect other than human capital, our approach would be an imperfect measure of human capital. However, both of these claims are still an empirical question. We maintain that the selected indicators are essential components of the human capital index targeted here.\nThese three indicators (i.e., SECO, SciP, and RITE) enter in iterated principalcomponent factor analysis. Table 1 publications contribute about 20% to the principal factor but secondary education seems to play a very small part towards cognitive skills. Not reported due to space limitations, factor loading estimates suggest that secondary education and scientific research are important ingredients in the formation of human capital. Morever, the resuls suggest that it is cognitive skills that associate with IT equipment that is the most important component of human capital.\n- Table 1 Thus, the reliability ratio ratio represents the fraction of the variance of h 1 that is due to the true variance of h*. Given that R(h 1 ,h 2 ) is the coefficient estimate of h 1 in a bivariate regression with h 2 as the explained variable, Table 2 presents reliability ratios for the four measures in levels, and conditional on the log of per capital real GDP in 1970-73. These are bivariate bootstrap quantile regression coefficient estimates. 27 When compared to EDU, the reliability ratio of SKILLS in levels is 1.03\nwhile that of EDU is 0.73. The new index also seems to perform better against EDU_CS and TIMSS. Table 2 shows that SKILLS also outperforms all three alternatives in conditional regressions. 28 Overall, we conclude that the new latent index of 'cognitive skills' performs better than existing measures.\n- Table 2 The Appendix has more details. Note, for comparability, EDU_CS, TIMSS and SKILLS were rescaled into equivalent years of education, EDU, using robust panel FGLS, for Lane (2002) shows that GLS estimation minimises the bias in random variable transformations. 27 Similar results were obstained when robust regressions were employed. 28 We also considered SECO and the cross-section IQ series of Lynn and Vanhanen (2002) . The new SKILLS index was still observed to be superior.\n(education equivalent) one month.

Three decades later, that number had risen to 15 in 2000-03. 34 This finding contrasts with that of Benhabib and Spiegel (2005) reported above and calls for greater attention to skills that matter in development policy. Intuitively, the main cause of the inability of countries at risk to catch up with the rest of the world is the low level of h in the context of a relatively low diffusion effect (i.e., 0.054) -as compared to the local innovation effect of 0.008 -which is not sufficient to offset the local innovation gains in advanced economies.

We adopt the two-level CES production function of Duffy, Papageorgiou and Perez-Sebastian (2004) but allow technology growth to be endogeneous, as proposed by Benhabib and Spiegel (2005) . More formally, we define the log of TFP, lnA t , as follows:\nHere, y t is again the log of per capital GDP, S t is skilled labour, N t is unskilled labour, \uf071 is the Allen intra-class elasticity-of-substitution parameter between K and S, \uf072 is Allen inter-class elasticity-of-substitution between K and N.

Thus, it appears that human capital defined as a latent index of cognitive skills also contributes to innovation and diffusion under CES production with capital-skill complementary.\nIn contrast, the cross-section OLS regression coefficients estimates are not statistically significant. These cross-section results cast doubt on the validity of the model or the form of the production technology. Thus, we reserve judgment until we consider a translog production function that allows both the CSC and SBTC hypotheses to be nested.\n- Table 4 about here -"}, {"section_title": "Translog Production Technology: Calibration", "text": "The translog production function is a more flexible functional form that allows us to disentangle capital-skill complementary (CSC) effects from skill-biased-technicalchange (SBTC) effects.

Once again, we define skilled labour, S, as above: S=s*POP. We follow Papageorgiou and Chmeralova (2005) to involve ln(Y/L) as a regressor in order to account for a non-homothetic production function. Columns\n(1)-(3) in Table 5 summarise the system GMM coefficient estimates. Again, the evidence is similar to that reported above where the SKILLS index is most consistent 40 The imputed measure of (W S /W N ) was on the basis of simultaneous quantile regressions of the Papageorgiou and Chmeralova (2005) estimates of (W S /W N ) on secondary education (SECO), and dummy variables for Sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern European transitional economies and South American nations. 41 We apply the formula\nwhere S=s*POP, s is the share of the population who has completed secondary education (Barro and Lee, 2010) while POP is total population. Again, we obtained similar results when the primary education equivalent series was used as a proxy for s.\nwith the model, except that now the null hypothesis of technology diffusion is rejected only at 10% significance level.\nFurthermore, the cross-section OLS regression estimates in columns (4)-(6) are now statistically significant for SKILLS and its coefficients seem to be of plausible value and with the right signs. Again, the local innovation coefficient for TIMSS is again extremely large when compared to the h(A i /A max ) coefficient, as in Tables 3-4 .\nOverall, the magnitude of the coefficient estimates in Table 5 compare to those in Table 3 rather than those in Table 4 . 42 The evidence indicates that the new latent index of cognitive skills plays a significant role in innovation and technology diffusion. However, only under a translog production technology the cross-section evidence is consistent with the system GMM findings.\n- Table 5 about hereFinally, we utilise the new estimates of \uf051 S , (K/Y) and (W S /W N ) to test the validity of model (11), and the results appear in Table 6 . In order to compare our results with Papageorgiou and Chmeralova (2005) , we employ simultaneous quantile regressions (i.e., simultaneous estimation of the lowest and highest quartiles) to account for nonlinearities and report results for the early 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. The results indicate that the CSC hypothesis, once a unique feature of developed economies, has become a global phenomenon since the early 1990s. Further, we find limited evidence of skilled-unskilled labour complementarity. Further, the SBTC effect seems to have increased since the 1990s. Finally, our findings suggest that the production function is non-homothetic, as in Papageorgiou and Chmeralova (2005) .\n- Table 6 about here - 42 We also experimented with the replacement of secondary education, SECO, with years of education, EDU, in both factor analysis and in the estimation of equation (5). We obtained similar system GMM estimates but the cross-section OLS coefficient estimates were no longer significant in the CobbDouglas and CES specifications. Yet, the cross-section estimates for SKILLS were highly significant statistically under translog production technology.\nHence, the evidence in this section provides support for the CSC and SBTC hypotheses and suggests that these effects, once exclusively developed-world effects, have become global phenomena. Finally, it would be insightful to extend the analysis in future reseach to other growth models and test their performance using the new index of human capital. For, example, it would be important to examine whether the new index of cognitive skills proposed here can bridge the gap between assimilation and accumulation theories. Put 43 We also experimented with an alternative series of skilled labour, S, where the latent index of skills was normalised to be in the range [0, 1] . The estimates were very similar to those in the Tables 4-7 Distance to the frontier in country i in period t, also expressed as (A/A max ).
