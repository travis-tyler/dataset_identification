[{"section_title": "School leadership: Then and now", "text": "The role of the school principal in South African schools has evolved. No longer are they only seen as managers and administrators; they are also expected to be the standard bearers of teaching and learning activities at the school. South African secondary schools operate in varying socioeconomic conditions, and principals in these contrasting contexts are faced with challenges and tasks that may require differing school leadership and management (SLM) approaches. These challenges must be overcome while striving for quality educational outcomes.\nMost of the research on SLM and educational outcomes in South Africa is based on small-scale studies and are descriptive in nature. Here, we used data from the 2015 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), a nationally representative study of Grade 9 learners and their school environments. 2 Our aims were to compare the characteristics of SLM in no-fee, fee-paying, and independent schools 3 and to determine whether mathematics achievement gaps in different"}, {"section_title": "School leadership and local learning contexts in South Africa", "text": "Tia Linda Zuze and Andrea Juan schooling contexts could be explained by the SLM qualities of a school. We measured SLM based on calculated indicators of a) instructional leadership, b) promoting an orderly and supportive environment, and c) the principal's experience and training. The findings are based on multivariate estimations using self-reports from the principal and two teachers from 292 secondary schools in South Africa. This methodology allowed us to determine the associations (but not any causal relationships) between SLM characteristics and mathematics across schools that are similar in ways such as resourcing or student wealth."}, {"section_title": "Key findings:", "text": "1. There are striking SLM differences between no-fee and fee-paying public schools and independent schools Access to particular SLM environments largely depends on the type of school that a learner attended. Compared to public school principals, independent school principals reported that their teachers were more competent, their parents were more supportive, and that their students demonstrated greater readiness to learn and engage in school activities (see Figure 1 ).\nWe found that better SLM was related to access to higher quality physical and human resources, but there were some exceptions. There were some instances where the quality of school leadership in better-resourced, fee-paying schools more closely resembled poorly-resourced, no-fee public schools than it did independent schools (for example in the relationship between discipline, safety and achievement). However, when it came to instructional leadership, patterns for fee-paying and independent schools were very similar.\nAlthough the motives for principals' length of stay at a school are likely to be different, there were wide gaps between public and independent schools in this area. In independent secondary schools sampled in TIMSS, 80% of principals had worked at the current school for up to 10 years. In contrast, 80% of principals in secondary public schools (no-fee and fee-paying) had been at the same school for up to 17 years. "}, {"section_title": "Academic achievement was worse in unsafe and violent schools", "text": "School safety and discipline mattered more for academic achievement in public schools than in independent schools. No-fee and fee-paying public schools with a more functional environment had higher average achievement scores in mathematics than similar schools with less safety and order. This echoes previous studies about the importance of ensuring basic functionality in challenging educational environments. 4 It also supports related research about the benefits of scripted lessons as well as regular monitoring and assessment of teachers in poor schools, all of which rely heavily on a structured and orderly environment. "}, {"section_title": "A principal's professional experience was more important for achievement in independent schools than in public schools", "text": "The work experience of a school principal paid greater achievement dividends in independently managed schools than in public schools. We found that students in independent schools benefited from principals who had a tenure of more than 6 years at the school, relative to shorter periods of time. These factors remained important, even when the quality of the school and a student's background were accounted for. This suggests either that that these principals were higher quality candidates or that they possessed greater autonomy over hiring and firing. The independent nature of these schools may enable these principals to have more influence at the classroom level in terms of teacher practice.\nThe link between professional experience and learner achievement was not found in public schools 6 , however, it is known that other factors, such as union affiliation, influence professional appointments in schools. 7 Union pressures would be less of a factor in independent schools, which could explain the significance of a principal's work experience in these settings."}, {"section_title": "In summary", "text": "1. How South African schools are led varies greatly by school type, and the relationship between SLM and academic achievement depends on the socioeconomic status of schools and students.\n2. The type of SLM reflected in independent schools suggests that autonomy may be linked to better practices or that the quality of principals in these schools is substantially better.\n3. There were few associations found between SLM characteristics and students' mathematics achievement in no-fee schools. "}]
