[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Both normal aging and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) cause morphological changes of the brain. It is generally difficult to distinguish these two causes of morphological change by visual inspection of magnetic resonance (MR) images. To facilitate making this distinction and thus aid the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders, we propose a method for developing a spatio-temporal model of morphological differences in the brain due to normal aging. The method utilizes groupwise image registration to characterize morphological variation across brain scans of people with different ages. To extract the deformations that are due to normal aging we use partial least squares regression, which yields modes of deformations highly correlated with age, and corresponding scores for each input subject. Subsequently, we determine a distribution of morphologies as a function of age by fitting smooth percentile curves to these scores. This distribution is used as a reference to which a person's morphology score can be compared. We validate our method on two different datasets, using images from both cognitively normal subjects and patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). Results show that the proposed framework extracts the expected atrophy patterns. Moreover, the morphology scores of cognitively normal subjects are on average lower than the scores of AD subjects, indicating that morphology differences between AD subjects and healthy subjects can be partly explained by accelerated aging. With our methods we are able to assess accelerated brain aging on both population and individual level.

Quantitative methods that can distinguish brain morphology due to healthy aging from morphology due to accelerated aging or pathology can therefore aid and possibly improve the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases (Brewer, 2009) .\nQuantitative information on brain morphology is usually obtained by measuring e.g. tissue volumes and regional volumes (Brewer, 2009 ). However, these measures do not provide fully detailed information about shape differences, since volume is a quantity of an enclosed surface, and shape is a description or outline and therefore potentially much more informative (Davis et al., 2010) . Results on hippocampal shape studies suggest that shape may have additional predictive value over volume when used in the prediction of Alzheimer's disease (Achterberg et al., 2010; Costafreda et al., 2011) . Therefore, there is an emerging interest in methods for quantifying shape differences and variations in shape in the human brain.\nIn literature, several methods for estimating models quantifying these shape differences and changes have been proposed. Davis et al. (2010) proposed a kernel regression on image dissimilarities to estimate a brain image representative for each age. Both Serag et al. (2012) and Dittrich et al. (2014) use a similar or more advanced kernel regression to build a spatio-temporal atlas for neonatal and fetal brain development respectively. The latter two methods are especially suited for fetal and neonatal brain development, where the brain rapidly grows with increasing age. Fishbaugh et al. (2017) developed a geodesic shape regression method which uses a sparse representation of diffeomorphisms, describing complex nonlinear changes over time with a small number of model parameters defined by the user. The mentioned methods estimate change in mean morphology of the population with age, but do not model the statistical distribution; the mean, but not the variance of the morphology at a certain age, is modelled. This concern was addressed by Ziegler et al. (2012) , who presented numerous approaches that relate aging to differences in brain morphometry. They considered generative models (in which brain morphology is predicted from age) and recognition models (in which age is predicted from brain morphology) in cross-sectional data, and models that estimate individual decline and explain inter-individual variability in aging in longitudinal data.\nRather than predicting age or brain morphology, or classifying healthy and diseased subjects based on brain morphology, we propose a method that generates a reference distribution of healthy brain morphologies as a function of age to which an individual brain can be compared. Like Marquand et al. (2016) , Ziegler et al. (2014) , and Brewer (2009) we use a normative modeling approach, in which we aim to quantify the variation within a population and assess deviations from that population. Marquand et al. applied normative modeling to assess deviations of brain structure or function as a function of clinical covariates (e.g. cognitive test scores). Brewer et al. assesses deviations of volumetric MR imaging measures as a function of age. Ziegler et al. provide normative voxelwise maps of local gray matter abnormalities and global tissue volume z-scores. In our approach we aim to assess deviations of typical aging patterns of the brain morphology, measured with voxelwise deformations. To generate a distribution of brain morphologies we aim to find brain deformation patterns that are highly correlated with age. To achieve this we choose a data-driven approach using structural MR brain scans of elderly people in a wide age range (46y -92y). We determine the morphology distribution by applying a regression model to the morphological variation within these brains. The morphological variation is characterized by deformation fields that map each brain image to a common space, which is a standard approach in computational anatomy (Baloch and Davatzikos, 2009 ). We compute these deformation fields with a groupwise image registration technique. Since we are only interested in the deformations due to aging, we employ a regression technique called partial least squares regression (PLSR). PLSR is especially suitable when there are more predictors than samples and when the predictors are highly collinear or linearly dependent (Wold et al., 2001; de Jong, 1992) . It was first evaluated for neuroimaging by Krishnan et al. (2011) to relate brain function to behavior. Ziegler et al. (2013) used multivariate PLS correlation to explore the relationship between cognitive ability patterns and differences in local brain anatomy in the maturing brain. Singh et al. (2014) used PLSR to quantify anatomical shape variation in the brain. They used kernel PLSR to find the relationship between the manifold of diffeomorphisms from atlas to subject domain and global cognitive and functional assesment test scores. Whereas Singh et al. were interested in the PLSR regression coefficient, we aim to find deformation patterns that are most correlated with age, i.e. the PLSR loadings. With each of these loadings comes a corresponding score, and we use these scores to quantify the distribution of brain morphologies due to aging. The density of a distribution can be indicated with percentile values: measures specifying the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall. The morphology distribution, however, is a function of age, and therefore we fit percentile curves to quantify how this distribution varies with age. To assess if an individual suffers from accelerated brain aging, its score can be compared to these percentile curves.\nTo validate our method, we use 988 structural MR brain scans from the population-based Rotterdam Scan Study (RSS), a prospective study among community dwelling subjects aged 45 years and over (Ikram et al., 2015) . The method's robustness against scanning protocol and its diagnostic value is evaluated using the 988 scans from the RSS and a selection of 509 scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset which is adopted from the study of Cuingnet et al. (2011) . The morphology score distribution and the corresponding 4D atlases are made publicly available through a web-based application at www.agingbrain.nl."}, {"section_title": "Extension of preliminary results", "text": "Preliminary results of this method were presented at SPIE Medical Imaging, San Diego 2016 (Huizinga et al., 2016b ). In the current work, we considerably expand the previous study. First, in this version we use the displacement field inside the brain instead of the transformation parameters, in order to exclude deformation outside the brain. The control points of the B-spline transformation model that exist outside the brain region influence the deformation field both outside and inside the brain. We do not want deformations in the background to be part of the modeling, which is why we chose the displacement field inside the brain. This voxel-based approach also makes the method more generalizable to other nonparametric registration methods and other voxelwise tissue property maps. Second, we correct for the subject's head position in the scanner by removing rigid body motion inside the brain mask from the deformation field. Third, we introduce a method to determine the number of PLSR components. Fourth, we analyze the residuals that contain deformations due to factors other than aging, e.g. unexpected pathologies. Fifth, we take into account other covariates such as sex and height. Sixth, we added an evaluation of our method on the ADNI dataset."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "We propose a method for modeling brain morphology and its distribution over the population as a function of age.

Let x be an image coordinate in \u211d 3 . The function I train n \u00f0x\u00de gives the intensity of image n at x, i.e. I train n \u00f0x\u00de : \u03a9 n \u2282\u211d 3 \u2192\u211d. Let N be the total number of images in the training set. The aim of the groupwise registration is to find a set of coordinate transformations T n \u00f0x\u00de : \u03a9 template \u2192\u03a9 n , n 2 f1\u2026Ng, such that the warped images I train n \u00f0T n \u00f0x; \u03bc n \u00de\u00de are aligned with each other in the template domain. The image registration is performed with a parametric approach. The degrees of freedom of the transformation is limited by introducing a parameterization to the transformation: T n \u00f0x; \u03bc n \u00de, where \u03bc n is a vector containing the transformation parameters of subject n. In our method, these transformations are determined in two steps. First, we obtain a coarse alignment of all images in the training set via transformations T (Mazziotta et al., 2001 ) to the subject-specific domains \u03a9 n . Second, as shown in the top-left part of The T B n are parameterized by cubic B-splines (Rueckert et al., 1999) . We chose cubic B-splines, because their compact support property makes the computation efficient, which is relevant in our large-scale groupwise image registration problems. The spacing of the control points of the B-splines is a setting with which the degrees of freedom of the transformation can be controlled. The parameters of the B-spline transformation model, \u03bc B n , are B-spline control point coefficients. To obtain \u03bc B n , we use groupwise image registration. During such a registration, \u03a9 template is implicitly defined by constraining the sum of all deformations from the template to each subject to be zero, an approach proposed by Bhatia et al. (2004) and Balci et al. (2007) . To achieve this, \u03bc B n must be optimized simultaneously for all n 2 f1\u2026Ng. Advantages of groupwise registration are that the information of all images is taken into account during the registration and, as opposed to pairwise registration, the result is not biased towards any chosen reference image.\nFor the non-rigid groupwise image registration we use the method of Huizinga et al. (2016a) . This method was designed for intra-subject registration of images originating from a quantitative MRI experiment. It is therefore robust against arbitrary intensity scaling between the aligned images. In this work we investigate if the method is applicable to inter-subject registration as well. The method assumes that, when images are registered, the intensities can be mapped to a low-dimensional subspace. The dimension of this low-dimensional subspace depends on the model describing the intensity variation in the aligned images. When this subspace is assumed to be one-dimensional, the intensity may vary due to a global scale or shift, which is the case for our application. In this case, the method could be considered as an extension of normalized cross-correlation from pairwise (N \u00bc 2) to groupwise \u00f0N > 2\u00de settings.\nIn our experiments, the image registration was performed with Elastix (Klein et al., 2010) . We used a multi-resolution strategy with four resolutions in which the control point spacing of the B-spline transformation model is halved with each resolution step, until a final spacing of 10 mm. The final spacing was determined heuristically."}, {"section_title": "Individual registration to the template domain", "text": "To be able to compare the brain image of an individual, I i , to the reference model, we need a deformation field that maps I i to \u03a9 template .

This section explains the transformations and domains shown in the bottom-half of Fig \u00f0T n \u00f0x\u00de\u00de ! for x 2 \u03a9 template , however, the disadvantage of such an approach is that I is blurry at the cortex edges which hampers accurate registration at those locations. Therefore, we use a different approach that is visualized in Fig. 2 and explained below.\nWe propose to formulate the non-rigid registration of I i to the template domain as an additional non-rigid groupwise registration, involving N \u00fe 1 images, namely the N previously registered training images I \nTo bring I i to \u03a9 template we finally compute T B i : \u03a9 template \u2192\u03a9 MNI as:\nwhere T \u00c01 \u00f0x; \u03bc\u00de is the inverse of T\u00f0x; \u03bc\u00de, obtained using the procedure described in Metz et al.

In this way, scale and skew transformations are preserved, and any rigid body motion present in T B is also eliminated.\nFor any rigid transformation T R n parameterized by \u03bc R n , the residual deformation is defined by:\nThe rigid transformation parameters of each subject are estimated by:\nwhere \u03a9 mask is the domain containing voxels inside the brain mask in \u03a9 template to ensure that we only evaluate the deformation inside the brain.\nIn the statistical analysis that follows we will be using d\nThe same approach is applied to the individual deformation field d i ."}, {"section_title": "Partial least squares regression", "text": "We aim to correlate the deformations obtained by image registration with age.

Let Y be the N \u00c2 1 vector containing the corresponding ages of each subject, then PLSR finds the directions in the deformation space that explain the maximum covariance with age. Let X 0 \u00bc \u00f0X \u00c0 X\u00de and let Y 0 \u00bc \u00f0Y \u00c0 Y\u00de, where X and Y are the column-wise data means replicated to all N rows. In PLSR X 0 is decomposed into:\nLet L be the number of components used in the PLSR, then S are the N \u00c2 L scores and P are the 3M \u00c2 L orthonormal loadings. Matrix E is the N \u00c2 3M residual matrix. The decomposition of X 0 is made by maximizing the covariance between Y 0 and a weighted sum of X 0 . The weight vector W j for each component 1 j L is estimated by solving the following optimization problem:\nThe weight vector is found by a singular H\u20ac oskuldsson, 1988; de Jong, 1992) . The PLSR scores for component j are defined as S j \u00bc X 0 W j , and the loadings of component j are defined as\ndeflated with each iteration of the algorithm to obtain W j , S j and P j for j ! 2.\nThe number of components used in PLSR is a tradeoff between overfitting (too many components) or losing valuable information (not enough components). To determine the optimal number of components we propose to use the randomization test of Wiklund et al. (2007) . In this test a null-distribution of \u00f0S j \u00de T Y 0 is determined by randomly permuting Y. When the probability of finding the observed \u00f0S j \u00de T Y 0 is smaller than \u03b1, the component is significant. Since PLSR is prone to overfitting, we chose a conservative significance level of \u03b1 \u00bc 0:01. Results of the randomization test showed that only the first PLSR component was significant (see Sec. 4.1). We therefore only used the scores of the first PLSR component, S 1 , to describe the brain morphology distribution as a function of age, and from here on, we omit the superscript 1.\nTo compare an individual subject to the reference population, the morphology score of this individual subject, S i , is required. To this end, the individual deformation field d \u00c3 i is projected on W to obtain S i :\nwhere X is a vector of size 3M with the column-wise means of X.Since an individual's brain morphology may not only change due to aging but also due to pathology we also propose to compare the individual's residual to that of the model. Each row of the residual matrix E contains the non-agerelated deformations for a subject in I train n . The residual norm of I train n is defined as:\nwhere E nm is element \u00f0n; m\u00de of matrix E. The residual of an individual is defined as:\nInspection of E i is important since an individual could have a different morphology due to other factors than aging. If this is the case, it would not be visible by the individual's morphology score. We therefore propose to compare the individual residual norm E i to the distribution of E n in I train n\n. If E i is significantly different from the distribution of E n further inspection of d \u00c3 i is necessary. To perform the PLSR, we implemented the SIMPLS algorithm (de Jong, 1992) in Python."}, {"section_title": "Percentile curve fitting", "text": "The score of subject n in I train n is referred to as S n . To visualize the distribution of scores S n as function of age we fit percentile curves. These curves show both the distribution of the morphology scores and how they vary with age. We refer to the p th % percentile curve at age a as s\u00f0a; p\u00de. For fitting of percentile curves to the morphology score data, we use the LMS method (Cole and Green, 1991) . The LMS method assumes that the data is standard normally distributed after applying the Yeo-Johnson transformation, which is an extension of the Box-Cox transformation proposed by Cole and Green (1991) . This method estimates the \u03bb\u00c0parameter of the Yeo-Johnson transformation (Yeo and Johnson, 2000) (L), the median (M) and coefficient of variation (S) for the appropriate morphology score at each age. With the parameters L, M, and S, percentiles can be computed at each age to obtain a smooth curve. The smoothness of the fitted curves is influenced by the degrees of freedom \u03b4, a user-defined parameter. In our experiments, we set the smoothness parameter \u03b4 to a value of 2 and we deployed the R-package VGAM (Yee, 2010) for the percentile curve fitting.\nThe value of the morphology score may also be influenced by other covariates than age, e.g. sex or height, since those covariates may influence the head size and may therefore affect brain scaling in the deformation fields that are used in the PLSR. It is therefore desirable to correct the reference distribution for these covariates. We model the correction for these two covariates as a linear shift in the morphology score distribution.\nThe precision of the estimated percentile curves depends on the number of datapoints in the appropriate age range. If the data is nonuniformly distributed over age, it could be that the curve estimation is not precise in the part where there are very few datapoints. To assess the precision of the fitted curves, we use a bootstrapping procedure, by random sampling subjects with replacement and re-estimating the percentile curves. A distribution of possible curves is collected, from which confidence intervals at any significance level can be estimated (Carpenter and Bithell, 2000) ."}, {"section_title": "Spatiotemporal atlas construction", "text": "The deformation having the highest covariance with age is contained in the loading vector P. To be able to interpret the morphology score it is necessary to know what this deformation looks like, and therefore we aim to visualize P as a spatio-temporal atlas.

Instead of multiplying with just one specific score S n , we multiply P with s\u00f0a; p\u00de for a chosen range of a and a specific p. We choose to show the aging trajectory of I.

The confidence bounds of the median curves of MCInc134 and MCIc76 group overlap slightly, possibly due to the lower number of subjects in MCIc76."}, {"section_title": "Model validation", "text": "We validated the model using data from the RSS database, in which we trained the model on a subset of 888 images, RSS888, and tested on the remaining 100 images, RSS100.

We applied the framework to a set of 988 images of non-demented aging subjects from a large population imaging study and on a set of 509 subjects from the casecontrol study ADNI. The main mode of deformation due to aging, P, shows the expected deformation patterns due to aging: larger ventricles, (cortical) atrophy, and brain shrinkage. We performed various experiments to validate the proposed method. The results of these experiments are encouraging and show clinical potential.\nThe leave-100-out experiment (1) showed that the PLSR generalizes for subjects that were not part of the training set. The leave-100-out experiment (2) showed that we can reproduce the morphology scores from leave-100-out experiment (1). This indicates that the deformations resulting from the individual subject registration to the template are similar to the deformations following from the groupwise registration, and that the method can be used to compute individual morphology scores. We did observe a slight bias when comparing the scores of leave-100-out experiment (1) and leave-100-out experiment (2). This is due to the fact that the starting point of the registration in leave-100-out experiment (1) is different from the starting point of the registration in leave-100-out experiment (2), leading to slightly different deformation fields. The percentile curves computed on the ADNI database showed a difference between the morphology score distributions of the CN and AD subgroups (median difference significant, i.e. no overlapping confidence bands, for the age range 60-72y), and, interestingly, also between MCInc and MCIc (median difference not significant, i.e. confidence bands overlap). Although it was not specifically trained to separate the groups, the model showed that the AD and MCIc patients have, on average, higher morphology scores than the CN and MCInc groups. The distributions of the norm of the PLSR residual, E, between the four groups was not significantly different, indicating that the non-age related deformations were of similar magnitude.\nTo evaluate the reproducibility across datasets we computed scores of both AD and cognitive normal individuals from the ADNI database using the RSS subjects as reference data. The cognitive normal subjects from ADNI fell nicely within the morphology score distribution of the cognitive normal subjects from RSS. The AD subjects had on average higher morphology scores than the cognitively normal subjects. These results suggest that the proposed method is able to compute individual morphology scores of subjects from one population when trained on subjects from another population. We did observe that kEk is different for the two databases of scans, which we did not see when registering subjects from the same population. Possible causes for this are the presence of non-age-related morphology differences between the two populations, e.g. differences in scanner type or protocol, inclusion criteria, demographics, environmental factors, etc."}, {"section_title": "Suggestions for future work", "text": "Several improvements can be made to the proposed model to increase sensitivity and performance. Also, the proposed method can be used in a variety of applications.\nThe uncertainty in the percentile curves was quantified by bootstrapping, obtaining confidence intervals for each curve. The uncertainty on individual morphology scores due to registration errors was not taken into account in the presented method. However, this could be estimated by perturbation of the individual deformation field, according to estimations of registration uncertainty. In this way, a distribution of possible morphology scores for this individual could be obtained. Obtaining reliable estimates of registration uncertainty is, however, still an active topic of research (Folgoc et al., 2016; Sokooti et al., 2016; Kybic, 2010) .\nOverall, the experiments showed that the proposed method is valid when comparing individual brain morphologies to a (cognitively) healthy reference population. Diagnostic value of the morphology score alone, however, is limited due to the high variability between individuals. In this study, we applied our method to T1-weighted MRI brain scans, but in principle, it could be applied to scans of other sequences or modalities. Future work may investigate age and other demographics related changes in other voxelwise maps, such as diffusion or perfusion imaging derived maps. This can be accomplished by replacing the deformation field d \u00c3 with such a voxelwise map in the template domain.\nThis could possibly improve discriminative ability between people at risk of accelerated brain aging and people without risk. Besides application of this method to voxelwise maps, it can also be applied to selected points on the surface of a segmented anatomical structure of interest, for example the hippocampus. In that case, a spatiotemporal model and its variation in the population of that specific structure can be studied in more detail and individual anatomical structures can be compared to a reference shape distribution.\nIt is clinically relevant to follow how a person's brain morphology changes with age. The proposed method can be used to compute morphology scores of individual scans at baseline and at follow-up. Plotting the baseline and follow-up scores in the percentile curves allows comparing the aging trajectory of an individual to the (crosssectional) reference population. Following individual morphology scores over time allows estimation of the physiological variation in subject specific aging trajectories. On an individual level, inspection of these aging trajectories could be relevant in clinical trials to, for example, investigate if changes in e.g. medication or lifestyle have any effect. A clinical evaluation of the proposed deformation-based framework would be necessary to prove its value in the clinic. "}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "A limitation of using cross-sectional data, which was also mentioned by (Ziegler et al., 2012) , is that effects of different birth cohorts are not excluded.\nBecause PLSR tries to maximize the covariance between the morphology scores and age, and the number of predictor variables is high (\u00bc 3M\u226bN), it is very likely that it will find a linear relationship. Therefore, when modeling a population, and the relation with age is not expected to be linear, this may be a limitation of PLSR.\nTo compute the score of an individual brain image an additional groupwise registration of all images in the training set plus the individual brain image(s) has to be performed. This additional groupwise registration is time-consuming and therefore this is a practical limitation of our proposed framework. In the current implementation, the registration takes about two days and has to be performed on a machine capable of reserving 100 GB of RAM to complete the task. In the future we will search for possibilities to register an individual brain image to the template domain without having to perform an additional groupwise registration with the already registered training data. In the presented work, however, the groupwise registration is preferred over a pairwise registration for obtaining an unbiased result. This is supported by preliminary experiments which are not shown due to lack of space."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "We developed a spatio-temporal model of morphological differences in the brain due to normal aging. The method provides a representative distribution of brain morphologies as a function of age instead of a single population mean morphology. Our method reduces high dimensional morphology to a single score. This score can be interpreted using the spatio-temporal atlas showing which deformation due to aging belongs to that score.\nThe framework was tested using data from two different datasets. Experiments showed that the proposed method extracts the expected deformation patterns due to aging and they showed that on a group level there is a morphology difference between cognitively normal and AD subjects, which manifests as accelerated aging, indicating the potential at least for clinical group studies. The spatio-temporal model can be used to compare an individual's brain morphology to a cognitively healthy reference population. Smooth percentile curves showing the brain morphology changes as a function of age as well as spatiotemporal atlases derived from the cognitively healthy reference population (RSS988) are publicly available via an interactive web application at www.agingbrain.nl. We believe that this framework has the potential to be used clinically as an indicator of accelerated brain aging. "}, {"section_title": "Conflicts of interest", "text": "Wiro J.
