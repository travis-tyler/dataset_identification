[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Dementia is a leading cause of diseases for the elderly. Early diagnosis is very important for the elderly living with dementias. In this paper, we propose a method for dementia diagnosis by predicting MMSE score from finger-tapping measurement with machine learning pipeline. Based on measurement of finger tapping movement, the pipeline is first to select finger-tapping attributes with copula entropy and then to predict MMSE score from the selected attributes with predictive models. Experiments on real world data show that the predictive models such developed present good prediction performance. As a byproduct, the associations between certain finger-tapping attributes ('Number of taps' and 'SD of inter-tapping interval') and MMSE score are discovered with copula entropy, which may be interpreted as the biological relationship between cognitive ability and motor ability and therefore makes the predictive models explainable. The selected finger-tapping attributes can be considered as dementia biomarkers."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The world population is aging [1] and the diseases spectrum of world changes accordingly. In 2013, the WHO study [2] estimated the top 20 leading causes of death in 2030 showing that noncommunicable diseases, instead of communicable disease, will become the major threats to human lives. Among them are dementias, which are common in the elderly people. In the World Alzheimer Report 2009 [3] , Alzheimer's Disease International estimated that 36 million people worldwide were living with dementia, with numbers doubling every 20 years to 66 million by 2030, and 115 million by 2050.\nEarly diagnosis is crucial for dementia patients to make a timely plan of treatment, * Email: majian@hitachi.cn 2 intervention and long-term disease management, which will definitely benefit not only patients themselves but their families, caregivers and health service providers. However, research [4] showed that most patients currently living with dementia have not received a timely formal diagnosis. In high income countries, only 20-50% of dementia cases are diagnosed and documented in primary care, and this gap between early diagnosis and unidentified patients is even much greater in low and middle income countries.\nDiagnosing dementia involves cognitive assessment which measures brain functions, such as memory, thinking, language skills, attention, problem-solving, and many other mental abilities [5] . Additionally, diagnosis based on blood tests and brain imaging tests may also be helpful for checking for biological evidences to find or rule out the cause of certain symptoms in clinical practice.\nSince the first criteria for clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer Disease (also called the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria) was proposed at 1984 [6] , clinical guideline for AD diagnosis has been updated several times (at 1994 [7] , 2001 [8] , 2007 [9] , 2011 [10] ).\nIn those updates criteria for blood tests and brain imaging tests were evolving as new pathophysiological evidences were accumulated, while criteria for cognitive tests has experienced enduring clinical successes and hardly been revised. Among many candidate instruments for cognitive assessment, the MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) has always been recommended as the preference for diagnosis of dementia due to its reliable performance in practice [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] .\nThe MMSE, proposed by Folstein et al. [11] , is a 30-points instrument for cognitive assessment, consists of 7 groups of questions measuring different aspects of mental state, and takes about 4-20 minutes to conduct. It has been reported to enjoy a very popularity among clinicians since its birth [12] .\nThough there are many reliable instruments for cognitive assessment besides MMSE (such as Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Kokmen Short Test, among many others), those tests are still considered to be too complicated and time-consuming for certain clinical settings. In this sense, simple instrument with less time cost and comparable performance is dearly needed for early diagnosis of dementia. Previously, researchers have developed a type of finger-tapping device [13] , tried to utilize it as diagnosis tool to estimate MMSE score, and achieved promising results [14] . In this research, we will propose a method for predicting MMSE score from finger-tapping attributes developed with Machine Learning (ML) pipeline."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "The contributions of this paper are as follows:"}, {"section_title": "A ML pipeline comprising of Copula Entropy (CE) based variable selection and", "text": "predictive models is proposed, which is generally applicable to other similar ML problems and can leads to explainable ML models;\n2.

The outcome of the diagnostic models can be degrees of dementia severity or clinical scores. Though promising, those researches are far from practical clinical use, mainly due to limited data, unreliable performance, the 'Black-box' ML models, and fundamentally biomedical in-plausibility.\nSmart home, a broader topic for in-home elderly health monitoring technologies, has been reviewed by Liu et al.

The method is developed with a ML pipeline which comprises of CE based variable selection and predictive models. In the variable selection step, based on the data collected from healthy subjects and patients, the associations between certain finger-tapping attributes and MMSE score\nare measured with CE, and the mostly associated attributes ('Number of taps' and 12 'SD of inter-tapping interval') are selected. Then the selected attributes are fed into the predictive models (LR and SVR) to predict MMSE score. Experimental results showed that the models such built present good prediction performance. Due to the associations discovered by CE, the predictive model is explainable for clinical use.\nThe experimental results that certain finger-tapping attributes are associated with MMSE score indicates that motor ability and cognitive ability are associated since the finger-tapping attributes measure motor ability and MMSE measures cognitive ability.\nSuch association may means that both abilities are intrinsically related with each other and that declines of both abilities are syndromes of dementias, or broadly aging."}]
