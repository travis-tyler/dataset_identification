[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In this report, we compare the farm business and farm household outlook in December 2009 with the December 2010 outlook and discuss the key factors underlying the 2010 income and f nancial outlook. Chapter 1 discusses the farm income outlook and summarizes important drivers inf uencing the earnings of U.S. farm operations (value of production, direct Government payments, other sources of farm income, production expenses, and payments to stakeholders). Chapter 2 discusses farm household income, net worth, and well-being. Average farm operator household income is forecast to be $ 83,194 in 2010, up 7.8 percent from the 2009 estimate. Current income, however, can be an incomplete indicator of the well-being of farm operator households. Equity, or net worth, is more useful as an indicator of longer term performance of the farm household. In 2009, the average net worth of farm operator households was $915,019. Although operator households typically derive most of their wealth from farm assets, many farm households have a variety of nonfarm investments, including f nancial investments and nonfarm real estate. Chapter 3 presents the farm business income forecasts. U.S. agriculture is a diverse sector represented by a complex mix of business enterprises. Income forecasts highlight the diversity of f nancial outcomes and are based on applying sector level forecasts and receipts and expenses to the latest Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) data. ARMS is conducted by USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) in conjunction with the Economic Research Service (ERS). Average net cash income for farm businesses (intermediate-and commercial-sized operations) is projected to be $79,200 in 2010, 30.7 percent above the 2009 estimate of $60,600. Chapter 4 covers the market fundamental affecting farm asset values. Farm sector debt is expected to fall to about $240 billion in 2010 with real-estate debt dropping about 2 percent and non-real-estate debt dropping by about 3 percent. The favorable f nancial position of the U.S. agricultural sector is highlighted by two related indicators. First, the share of farms classif ed as vulnerable-high debt burden (over 40 percent of assets) and negative net income-dropped in this decade to the lowest levels that ERS has recorded. By 2009, only 5 percent of farms were vulnerable, the result of expanding income levels and asset values growing faster than debt. Second, entering 2010, over 60 percent of U.S. farmers reported both positive income and relatively low farm debt and were classif ed as being in a favorable f nancial position. The Special Article assesses the f nancial performance and solvency of farm businesses in the face of increased f nancial and commodity market volatility. Agricultural debt at risk remains relatively low but early warning indicators on delinquent and nonperforming loans held by insured commercial banks show a rise in potential loan defaults. In 2009, livestock farms held the largest share of debt at risk-56 percent. Even so, if interest rates should increase in the near future, ARMS data suggest only a modest impact on the number of f nancially stressed farms. The values of both crop and livestock production have trended steadily upward since 1970. However, the year-to-year movements in the two measures have not always been synchronized. In 2010, the percentage increase in the value of livestock production (16.6 percent) is expected to be more than f ve times that of crop production (3.1 percent). A primary factor driving the forecast for higher farm income in 2010 is the projected increase in cash receipts for all the livestock categories, led by double-digit growth in meat animals and dairy products. Net value added and net farm income have followed the value of commodity production over both the long term and in year-to-year f uctuations. Because farmers typically do not vary their production mix dramatically from year to year, purchases of production inputs have been relatively stable. Purchased inputs have been more stable than crop and livestock value of production, except for 2007-08, when they had double-digit increases. Increases in expenses for purchased inputs are projected to show an increase of 2.5 percent in 2010 after posting a 6.4-percent decline in 2009. The recovery in farm income shows a change in the pattern observed in 2009. The declines in all three measures of U.S. farm income that occurred in 2009 were driven by declines in annual crop cash receipts and declines in cash receipts for all the livestock categories. The 2009 fall in farm income was attributable mostly to large declines in crop and livestock prices at the farm level."}, {"section_title": "Livestock and Cotton Receipts Expected To Bounce Back in 2010", "text": "Dairy receipts are expected to increase by almost a third in 2010, as milk prices received by dairy farmers are projected to increase more than $3 per hundredweight (cwt). Cattle and calf cash receipts are expected to increase 13 percent in 2010. Hog cash receipts are expected to increase 26 percent over 2009 cash receipts due to stable pork demand and lower year-overyear pork production. Broiler cash receipts are expected to increase over 11 percent in 2010 due to an increase in prices and to the gradual reopening of exports to Russia. Egg cash receipts are expected to increase slightly in 2010 due to increased exports to Asia and the European Union, more than offsetting losses in exports to Canada and Mexico. From 2004 through 2010, the nominal value of farm sector production of crops and livestock increased over 25 percent (f g 1.1). Over three-quarters of that increase ref ects gains in the value of U.S. crop production. The value of crop production was about 49 percent of the agricultural sector's total value of production in 2004 to 2006, but accounted for 57 percent of the total from 2007 to 2010. Increases in the value of corn and soybean production from 2004 through 2010 accounted for 93 percent of the increase in feed crops and 94 percent of the rise in oil crops. These increases partially ref ect the impact that bioenergy has had on the value added to the U.S. economy by the farm sector (table 1.1). Both corn for grain and soybean receipts are expected to experience solid gains in 2010 ref ecting increased quantities sold at higher prices, benef ting from anticipated increases in domestic use and exports (f g 1.2). Crop production is expected to account for about 55.6 percent of the total value of farm sector production in 2010. Cotton receipts are expected to experience a sharp increase in 2010. Strong domestic and foreign demand for cotton combined with increased U.S. production, and continued tight global supplies are expected to lead to large increases in prices and quantities sold for both lint and seed. A rise expected in 2010 wheat cash receipts ref ects increased domestic use and a projected rise in exports. Declines in production are expected for apples, pears, and grapes, while the cranberry crop is expected to exceed last year's crop. California is expected to produce record navel orange and walnut crops. Total citrus production in Florida is expected to decline. Vegetable and melon receipts overall are expected to increase despite declines in receipts for potatoes. Record yields are expected to produce a large increase in U.S. production of dry beans and higher 2010 cash receipts."}, {"section_title": "Crop Farms To Contribute 64 Percent of U.S. Agriculture's Net Value Added in 2010", "text": "Crop farms account for less than half of U.S. farm operations but make up more than 70 percent of the sector's payments to stakeholders and more than 57 percent of U.S. agriculture's net farm income (table 1.2). Crop farms are expected to contribute almost 64 percent of U.S. agriculture's 2010 net value added, with cash grain and soybean farms accounting for half of that (f g. 1.3). High-value crop farms accounted for less than 7 percent of all U.S. farms in 2009, but accounted for nearly one-third of the value of the sector's crop production. Size matters in agriculture. Bigger farm operations, while fewer in number, contribute the bulk of the value of U.S. farm production and receive the lion's  share of agriculture's net farm income (see box, \"Measuring Agriculture's Value Added and Net Farm Income\"). For example, farm operations with over $1 million in 2010 sales are expected to account for over 60 percent of U.S. livestock value of production and almost 54 percent of U.S. agriculture's 2010 net farm income (table 1.3). Commercial farms-those with over $250,000 in annual sales-are expected to account for over 80 percent of U.S. agriculture's net value added in 2010 (f g. 1.4). Very large commercial farms-those with annual sales exceeding $1 million-alone generate more than half of U.S. value of production and net farm income (table 1.4) (see box, \"Farm Types,\" p. 10). Family farms, which include both commercial and noncommercial farms, are expected to account for almost 85 percent of net farm income (see box, \"Farm Income and Costs: Glossary,\" p. 9).

Each year, ARMS produces a farm-level estimate of value added that is as consistent as possible with sectorwide measures of value added and its components.

This level would be 19 percent below the 5-year average for 2005-09. Direct payments under the Direct and Counter-cyclical Program (DCP) and the Average Crop Revenue Election Program (ACRE) are forecast at $4.81 billion for 2010. Direct payment rates are f xed in legislation and are not affected by the level of program crop prices. The 4-percent decline in direct payments forecast in 2010 relative to the 5-year average is due to producers, receiving revenue insurance payments from the ACRE program. Those payments are expected to be $430 million in 2010. Authorized under the 2008 Farm Act, ACRE provides revenue insurance to participating producers in exchange for a 20-percent reduction in producers' annual direct-payment allotments beginning with the 2009 crop year. Low producer participation in the ACRE program-only about 1 in 11 directpayment recipients signed up for ACRE by the August 2009 deadline-has led to this smaller than expected decrease in actual direct payments. Counter-cyclical payments are forecast to decrease by 82 percent from $1.17 billion in 2009 to $210 million in 2010. Strong cotton prices are responsible for this projected decrease. Only producers of upland cotton and peanuts are expected to receive counter-cyclical payments in 2010. Marketing loan benef ts-including loan def ciency payments, marketing loan gains, and certif cate exchange gains-are projected at $120 million in 2010, down 89 percent from 2009 levels. Because of the high durumwheat loan rate, durum-wheat producers are expected to receive 93 percent of these benef ts, despite the recent rise in global wheat prices. Other wheat classes do not qualify for marketing loan benef ts. Prior to 2010, upland cotton producers received almost 91 percent of total marketing loan benef ts. However, strong 2010 cotton prices are expected to remain too high for cotton producers to qualify. Other commodities receiving marketing loan benef ts are barley, wool, mohair, and pelts. The Milk Income Loss Contract Program (MILC) compensates dairy producers when domestic milk prices fall below a specif ed level. Milk prices declined in 2009 due to the global recession, leading to $880 million in MILC payments being made in 2009. For 2010, rebounding milk prices are expected to reduce MILC payments to $55 million. Forecast at $820 million in 2010, Tobacco Transition Payment Program (TTP) payments are expected to continue a declining trend beyond 2010. Begun in 2005, this program provides annual payments over a 10-year period to eligible tobacco quota owners and producers of tobacco. Since the program's start, lump-sum payments to individuals have been made through agreements with third parties in return for the producers' and tobacco quota owners' rights to the 10-year TTP payment stream. Payments for 2010 include both Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) payments and lump-sum payments received by farm operators during the year (f g. 1.6). Producers' eligibility for f nancial help from these programs depends on the extent to which their crop or livestock losses meet a particular program's threshold for payments, once a county is declared eligible for disaster relief."}, {"section_title": "Spatial Concentration and Program Coverage Overlap of Direct Payments and Crop Insurance Subsidies", "text": "USDA, congressional representatives, and farm organizations have held discussion forums with farmers around the country in 2009-10 to discuss the upcoming 2012 Farm Bill.

The impetus for this proposal is to address current Federal budget pressures and the criticism that direct payments are made to farmers even when commodity prices are high. Farmers' level of support for this proposal varies by region (Good, 2010).

Source: USDA, Farm Service Agency, Natural Resources Conservation Service, and Commodity Credit Corporation. Figure 1.7 displays the spatial concentrations of direct payments from the Direct and Counter-cyclical Program and indemnity payments from the crop-insurance program. For a particular county, if producers received direct payments in 2008 equal to or above $20 per cropland acre and crop insurance indemnity payments averaged over 2007 to 2009 of less than $20 per cropland acre, then direct payments are said to be dominant. If producers received direct payments below $20 per cropland acre and crop-insurance indemnity payments equal to or above this amount, then crop-insurance indemnity payments are said to be dominant. If producers received both direct payments and crop-insurance indemnity payments at or above $20 per cropland acre, then there is program coverage overlap. The spatial concentration of direct payments differs from that of cropinsurance indemnity payments. Direct payments are dominant in the Corn Belt (corn and soybeans), Mississippi Delta (cotton and rice), and the Texas-Louisiana Gulf Coast (cotton and rice). Direct payment dominance is also found in Arizona (cotton), California (cotton and rice), and parts of the Southern Atlantic Seaboard. Crop insurance indemnity payments dominate the wheat-growing regions in the Northern Plains and parts of the Southern Plains, as well as North and South Carolina. Program coverage overlap  sector accounts estimates include such payments. If the ARMS estimates are compared only to the farm share of the sector accounts estimates, ARMS captures about 90 percent of payments in the administrative records. For 2006 to 2009, ARMS estimates of Government payments by program category are close to the annual estimates, with average capture rates ranging from 73 percent for other programs to almost 90 percent for counter-cyclical payments (see table 1.6). The sole exception is marketing loan benef ts: ARMS estimates capture on average only 25 percent of the corresponding sector estimates. During this period, nearly all of those payments went to cotton producers who sold their output through cooperatives. Cotton cooperatives in many States did not separate out marketing loan gains from other receipts when sending payments to member producers. This made it diff cult for those cotton farmers to provide accurate information on marketing loan benef ts in their survey responses. ARMS capture rates for total Government payments, direct payments, and conservation programs are very stable. In any given year, these capture rates vary from their 4-year averages by 2 to 8 percent (see table 1.6). 2 Direct payments depend on producers' historical yields and acreages of given commodities, not current prices. Conservation payments are largely from the Conservation Reserve Program, paid as f xed rents through 10-or 15-year contracts. In contrast, ARMS capture rates for counter-cyclical payments, marketing loan benef ts, and the miscellaneous category \"other program payments\" are much less stable and vary from their 4-year averages by 17 to 38 percent. During this period, the year-to-year variation in other programs was due to large swings in disaster relief and milk program payments. Variability in counter-cyclical payments, and to a lesser extent, in marketing loan benef ts, was inf uenced by signif cant changes in corn and cotton prices. The sources of the $3.3 billion in sector estimates not accounted for by ARMS, that is, the missing 25 percent, are spread fairly evenly across the different programs. Direct payments and marketing loan benef ts each account on average for about one-fourth of the ARMS measurement error, while conservation program and other program payments each account on average for about one-f fth. The only exception is counter-cyclical payments, which account on average for about 9 percent of the ARMS measurement error."}, {"section_title": "Moderate Rise Expected for U.S. Farm Production Expenses", "text": "Production expenses began to rise steeply in 2003 and continued that trend throughout 2004-08.

Table 1.7 shows how much a number of selected expenses grew from 2002 to 2008. The increases in expenses during the period were caused primarily by large increases in prices farmers paid for inputs.

Even in the long term, quantity factors do not necessarily have a great impact on expenses. For example, the 25-percent increase in f eld crop and oilseed production from 2003 to 2009 may have been accomplished with the same or even smaller amount of seed as yields improved. While the producer price index rose 27.5 percent between 2003 and 2008, the prices paid index (PPI) from USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service's Agricultural Prices for farm sector production items, interest, taxes, and wage rates (PITW) climbed 55 percent. The prices paid index for fertilizer rose 264 percent, the index for fuels and oils went up 207 percent, the index for feed was up 73 percent, and the index for seeds rose 83 percent. Real estate taxes were driven up by a 79-percent increase in land values. Farm sector expenditures on fuels and oils followed the rise in oil prices.  from $23.63 to $94.68 per barrel. Since fuels, especially natural gas, are the major input for many fertilizers, the rise in RAC and natural gas prices were the primary reason for the increase in fertilizer expenses. During this period, the annual average wellhead price for natural gas went from $2.95 per 1,000 cubic feet (mcf) to $8.08 per mcf. Expenses did not rise as much as prices for these two inputs because farmers employed steps to hold down production costs. For example, with both inputs, operators reduced quantities used. To lessen fuel use, they reduced trips over f elds. To cut fertilizer use, they conducted soil tests to optimize applications. Commercial production of red meats and poultry expanded 10 percent during this period, but the increase in feed expenses was due primarily to the increases in grain and oilseed prices. Prices received for feed grains rose 107 percent from 2003 to 2008 and prices received for oil crops rose 131 percent. Part of the upward push on corn prices came from the greater use of corn for ethanol production, resulting in historically high corn prices. Seed expenses have risen, in part, because farmers have been making greater use of genetically modif ed seeds for corn, cotton, and soybeans, which are relatively expensive. For example, since NASS began collecting information on prices for biotechnology-derived corn seeds in 2001, seed expenses have risen 67 percent. The increase in pesticide expenses was notable because the expense had been rising slowly through the early 2000s. In 2007-08, however, during that time, pesticide expenses jumped by $2.7 billion (30 percent), as prices paid rose 15.5 percent and producers increased their use of these materials. This generalized rise in prices came to an abrupt halt in 2009, when total production expenses fell, then rebounded moderately in 2010. However, nominal total production expenses in 2010 and 2009 still constitute the second-and third-highest totals ever (f g. 1.9). In 2009, production expenses dropped $12.0 billion (4.1 percent). Given the magnitude of the growth in costs experienced from 2003 to2008, the reduction in 2009 was welcomed by farmers, especially since gross farm income fell nearly 10 percent during the year. The reason for the fall was again mostly price-related. For the f rst time since 2002, the PITW index fell, dropping almost 3 percent. In 2010, production expenses are forecast to rise $5.6 billion (2.0 percent), a modest movement following the many years of substantial changes. Again, the overarching PITW index correlates with the small increase, as it is forecast to rise 2.3 percent. In contrast with 2009, only four expense categories change more than $1 billion and three are positive. In 2009, seven categories changed by more than $1 billion, and six expense categories showed a decline (f g. 1.10). Table 1.8 shows the movement in individual expenses along with their associated prices-paid indexes for 2009 and the 2010 forecast. A number of large changes switch direction in 2010: livestock and poultry purchases, fuels and oils, labor, and miscellaneous expenses. Fertilizer and lime expenses fall signif cantly in both years.  The average share of farm-household income from farming activities is forecast to increase from 8.9 percent in 2009 to 13.0 percent in 2010. About 60 percent of farm-operator households include either an operator and/or operator's spouse who work off the farm. The modest increase in off-farm income in 2009-10 ref ects economywide slow growth and weak labor markets. In 2008, the increase in off-farm income was less than 1 percent. Households that operate the largest 10 percent of farms (with sales of $250,000 or more) are the only U.S. farm households for which the average farm income is greater than off-farm income in a typical year. For 2008 to 2009, average farm-household income declined by 3.3 percent while the median farm household had a slight increase of 1.6 percent, to $52,235. (Median household incomes are not available for 2010 until August 2011.) The median is the income level at which half of all households have lower incomes and half have higher incomes. As a result, median incomes are less inf uenced by very high-income and very lowincome households than are averages; median income is generally lower and less variable than average income. In discussing the importance of farming income to households, it is useful to consider what the indicator measures. The farm share of farm-operator household income captures the cash returns from farming after accounting for the depreciation of farm capital. The measure excludes in-kind income like the rental value of the farm dwelling. More than three-quarters of principal farm operators reside in households on their farming operation. So, in addition to the farm yielding cash earnings and capital gains from farmland appreciation-to the extent that the household owns the farmland-households benef t by having their housing cost borne by the farm business. The typical U.S. household spends more than 20 percent of its expenditures (excluding principal payments on home loans) for housing. USDA's net farm income measure includes an estimate of the rental value of farm dwellings; the imputed rental value of farm dwellings is expected to be 6 percent of gross income of the farm sector in 2009 and accounted for more than 25 percent of net farm income. This rather stable in-kind source of farm income helps farm families better manage their low-farm income years. While income from farming activities excludes the noncash rental value of the farm dwelling, it does ref ect a farm expense for depreciation. Since farming is capital intensive, this expense can be sizable, especially for large farms. There are several ways to calculate depreciation. The approach ERS uses in estimating farm income is tax-based depreciation, which is affected by changes in tax laws. An alternative to tax-based depreciation is economic depreciation, which captures the value of capital consumed during the accounting period. While changes in tax laws can affect The farm operator household population includes everyone who shares the dwelling unit with a pr incipal operator of a family farm. This includes students away at school who are supported by the principal operator household and, if not away at school, would be sharing a d welling unit with the principal operator. A f arm is def ned as any place from which $1,000 or more of agricultural products were produced and sold, or normally would have been sold, during the year. Since the def nition allows farms to be included even if they did not have at least $1,000 in sales, but normally would have, USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) developed a system for determining how much a farm normally would have sold in a given year. If a place does not have $1,000 in sales, a \"point system\" assigns dollar values for acres of various crops and head of various livestock species to estimate a normal level of sales. \"Point farms\" are farms with less than $1,000 in sales but have points worth at least $1,000. More than one-quarter of farms have no sales in a typical year, and at least another 30 percent have positive sales of less than $10,000. The current def nition of a family farm (beginning with the 2005 estimates) is based on the Agricultural Resource Management Survey, and is a farm where the majority of the business assets are owned by individuals related by blood, marriage, or adoption. In 2009, 97.2 percent of U.S. farms were classif ed as family farms, and although the def nition has changed slightly over time, this share has been stable for at l east a de cade. The farm operator is t he person who r uns the family farm, making the day-to-day management decisions. In the case of multiple op erators, t he respondent for t he farm survey identif es who t he pr incipal farm operator is during the data collection process. USDA provides f nancial information for principal farm operators of family farms and their households, referred to as farm-operator households in this publication.

In recent years, the tax code has increased incentives for farmers to invest in capital by increasing the amount of capital purchases that can be expensed against taxable income. In 2005, the maximum amount was $105,000. It then rose to $108,000 for 2006, $125,000 for 2007, and then doubled to $250,000 for 2008 through 2010.

With the current $250,000 limit, the vast majority of capital investments can be expensed in the year acquired, thereby lowering income from farming activities for that year."}, {"section_title": "Farm Household Net Worth", "text": "Current income can be an unreliable indicator of the f nancial well-being of farm operator households. Many farm households generate low earnings, or even losses, from the farm business in a given year, but may experience much better farm returns over the long run. Equity, or net worth, which is the difference between assets and debts as of the last day of the year, ref ects this longer term performance, since a net worth position captures the accumulation of wealth over time. Moreover, depending on its liquidity or value as loan collateral, net worth can serve to sustain the household in years of lower income. Average net worth of farm households increased 4.5 percent from 2008 to 2009, to $915,019, owing largely to an increase in nonfarm asset values and a decrease in nonfarm debt. However, farm assets also increased from 2008 to 2009. With the exception of 2008, farmland values have been increasing for more than 20 years, leaving the typical farm-operator household in a historically strong f nancial position. (USDA does not forecast farm-operator household net worth for 2010. The 2009 estimate is based on farm survey data collected in 2010 for the end of the calendar year 2009.) In 2009, the average farm operator household had $1.03 million in assets and $115,981 in debt. About three-quarters of the value of assets owned by farm operator households is associated with the farm, on average, including the household's personal dwellings on the farm. In 2009, farm-owned operator dwellings represented 10 percent of the average household's assets and all other farm assets represented 64 percent. The high share of value in dwellings shows that many farms are small and a major portion of their value is in the farm operator's dwelling. Although operator households have most of their wealth in farm assets, farm households have a broad portfolio of nonfarm investments, including f nancial investments and nonfarm real estate. The portion of household debt associated with the farm (57 percent) is smaller than the portion of assets associated with the farm (76 percent). There are likely a variety of reasons for this, including the fact that the major portion of farm assets, farmland, has been appreciating at a relatively consistent positive rate, compared to nonfarm assets in the general economy. The major source of nonfarm debt is from nonfarm personal dwellings. Mortgages on other real estate and nonfarm business loans are also major sources of household debt."}, {"section_title": "Household Income Sources and Financial Portfolios, by Farm Size", "text": "The farm-operator household population is economically diverse, in part because of the USDA's encompassing def nition of a farm as any operation with the potential for at least $1,000 in sales of agricultural products in a year. One way to think about economic diversity is to distinguish households for whom agriculture makes important contributions to household income from those where it does not. Dividing farm households into categories based on the gross sales of their farms and calculating the average net income from farming activities for each category reveals that a household's net income from farming is negative for sales categories below $50,000, and so to simplify our presentation, we divide farm households into two groups using a cutoff of $50,000 in annual farm sales. High-sales farm households (those operating farms with $50,000 or more in gross sales) accounted for 95 percent of the value of sales of family farms in 2009. In 2009, the median income for both the low-and high-sales farm households was the second lowest over the period 2005 to 2009. However, low-sales farm households saw a 2-percent increase in median total income from 2008-09 while median income decreased by 6.7 percent for high-sales farm households. The increase for low-sales farm households came from higher off-farm and farm income in contrast to high-sales farm households where off-farm income increased but farm income dropped substantially owing to broad decreases in commodity prices. Table 2.2 reveals fundamental differences between low-and high-sales farm households. For one, high-sales farm households tend to have higher incomes. For 2005 to 2009, median total income for high-sales farm households ranged from 1.2 to 1.6 times greater than that of low-sales farm households. Another key difference is that median farm income is negative every year for lowsales farm households, though because of depreciation costs and the value of housing, this does not necessarily mean that farming is a drain on household f nances. It does highlight that households operating farms with modest gross sales depend on off-farm activities for their economic well-being. High-sales farm households, on the other hand, earn similar amounts from farm and offfarm sources. As a farm's gross sales increase, the operator's total household income and dependence on farm income also tend to increase. High-sales farm households, as a group, had a median income of $70,084 while those with farms having sales of at least $250,000 had a median total household income of $105,850. And while all high-sales farm households had a similar dependence on income from farm and off-farm sources, households with farms having at least $250,000 in sales had a farm income more than double its offfarm income (i.e., a median of $70,373, compared with $27,500). Principal operators of low-sales farms with off-farm jobs tend to work in diverse industries. The top three industries providing employment are construction (15 percent), retail and other services (15 percent) and agriculture, forestry, f shing or mining (14 percent). In contrast, the share of operators of high-sales farms who also work at off-farm jobs were far more likely to have an off-farm job in agriculture, forestry, f shing, or mining (28 percent did in 2009) than any other industry category. For both low-and high-sales households, the spouses of operators are most likely to work in the retail, education, or health care sectors, with each of the sectors responsible for a similar share of the jobs (f g. 2.1). The median net worth of high-sales farm households is $1,075,460, almost 2.4 times the net worth of low-sales farm households, $452,650. (Average 2009 net worth of low-and high-sales farm households was $649,606 and $1.61 million, respectively).  Low-sales farm households (less than $50,000 in gross sales) High-sales farm households (at least $50,000 in gross sales) The distribution of a household's wealth across asset types ref ects livelihood orientation and also the extent that changes in particular asset markets would affect a household's net worth. For low-sales farm households, about half of household assets consist of farm assets, not including dwellings. Dwellings and f nancial assets (retirement and nonretirement) compose another 30 percent. As expected given the greater importance of farm income, households associated with larger farms have a greater share of their assets (79 percent) in farm assets. Even though high-sales farm households have more than double the net worth of low-sales farm households, those with low sales have, on average, about $7,000 more in f nancial assets like stocks."}, {"section_title": "Distribution of asset holdings, 2009", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Farm Households Compared With the U.S. Population", "text": "For 2005 to 2009, the average and median household income for low-sales farm households were close to those for U.S. households.

In contrast, high farm-sales households had signif cantly higher incomes than both U.S. households and low-sales farm households, regardless of the year. Figure 2.2 shows the percent of low-and high-sales farm households in one of four wealth-income categories def ned by median U.S. household income and net worth. A household in the low income-low wealth group, for example, would have an income and net worth less than the median values for U.S. households. Only a small share of farm households falls into either of the low-wealth categories, regardless of farm sales. High-sales farm households are largely concentrated in the high income-high wealth category. In contrast, low-sales farm households are equally likely to be in either the low incomehigh wealth or the high income-high wealth categories.

The expected strong recovery in dairy, hog, and cattle receipts will result in much higher average net cash incomes for farm businesses in the Northern Crescent, Basin and Range, and Prairie Gateway regions. Agriculture is a diverse sector represented by a complex mix of business enterprises. This section focuses on the 850,000 farm businesses that are responsible for the majority of economic activity in the sector (see box, \"Def ning Farm Businesses,' p. 29, for more detail). Results reported here are designed to highlight the diversity of f nancial outcomes. We apply sectorlevel forecasts of receipts and expenses to the latest ARMS data to forecast net cash farm income for various types of farms. Estimates of farm-level income reported by USDA from ARMS have been developed to ref ect both the contributions of factor providers, such as creditors and landlords, and the use of business arrangements such as contracts. The net cash income reported for farms is the income available to share among owners and operators who participate in the farm's f nancing, production, and marketing outcomes. Cash f ow projections can be summarized across various groups of farms, based on regional location, commodity specialization, or size. The model is static and therefore does not account for changes in crop rotation, weather, and other local production impacts that occurred after the base year. The livestock sector experienced the brunt of the f nancial downturn in 2009, with dairy farm businesses sustaining the most severe losses (table 3.1). During 2009, prices for livestock and dairy products declined much faster than for feed costs, which strained net earnings for livestock and dairy producers. The strengthening U.S. economy and lower levels of hog products in the marketplace have helped support hog prices in 2010. In contrast to the outlook for a strong ($20 billion) recovery in livestock receipts, crop cash receipts are forecast to increase by half as much-$9.4 billion in 2010. Uncertainty regarding corn yields and production, continued demand for ethanol, and strong exports have contributed to signif cant price increases for corn, many feed grains, and soybeans in the second half of 2010. Crop farm businesses' bottom lines also will be enhanced by continued reductions in input costs. Fertilizer expenses are forecast to decline by 10 percent in 2010, after declining by almost 11 percent in 2009. Farm businesses that employ debt f nancing will benef t from relatively low interest rates, with interest expense forecast to be 1.4 percent lower in 2010. Higher expenses for fuel, labor, and taxes will likely offset some of the potential for lower total cash expenses in 2010. The projected increase in average income for corn, soybean, and wheat farm businesses ranges from 11-14 percent in 2010. Average incomes of cotton and rice farm businesses are forecast to increase by 33 percent on the strength of cotton price increases combined with modest increases in expenses. Average net cash income for farm businesses is expected to increase throughout much of the country in 2010. The expected strong recovery in dairy, hog, and cattle receipts will result in much higher average net cash incomes for farm businesses in the Northern Crescent, Basin and Range, and Prairie Gateway regions. In the Northern Crescent, where dairy is a prominent commodity, average net cash income for farm businesses is forecast to increase by over 58 percent. Incomes are expected to be almost 50 percent higher in 2010 for farm businesses in the Basin and Range region, where cattle are an important commodity.

Asset values and outstanding farm debt are fundamentally driven by expected returns on investments in farmland and other farm capital, and by interest rates. These factors vary across the country, ref ecting differences in expected net returns on the mix of crops and livestock produced locally, in credit market conditions, and in opportunities for off-farm employment and investments. Forecasts of rising net returns on farm investments are primarily due to rising cash receipts for crops and livestock, and to low interest rates. As a result, the value of farm business sector assets is expected to rise in 2010. Farm business sector assets and equity (assets minus debt) values are forecast to rise modestly in 2010, while farm debt is forecast to decline from 2009 levels (table 4.1).

The values of real estate, crop inventories, livestock and poultry inventories, purchased inputs, machinery and equipment, and f nancial assets are all expected to rise modestly in 2010. Interest rates in 2010 have remained low and stable, and credit has generally remained available through major agricultural lenders. Nonetheless, some farm businesses could be facing tightened credit requirements in 2010 as a consequence of increased loan collateral requirements and/or decreased loan repayment time periods.

The share of all U.S. farms classif ed as vulnerable has dropped since 1986 (the year when combined net farm income and balance sheet statements were f rst available for farm businesses), when nearly 12 percent of farms were in this f nancial position. The share of farms classif ed as being in a vulnerable position had a fairly sizable drop between 1986, when the 1980s farm crisis was ongoing, and the late 1980s and early 1990s, as debt was pared relative to asset values and incomes improved. More recently, the share of farms classif ed as vulnerable has dropped in this decade to the lowest levels that ERS  has recorded, as a result of expanding income levels and shrinking debt in relation to asset values. At the other extreme, about 62 percent of farms were in a favorable f nancial position entering 2010. These farms had both positive income and relatively low farm debt. For comparative purposes, 48 percent of farms were classif ed as favorable in 1986. In addition to a smaller share of farms being classif ed as vulnerable, another striking change has occurred in the share of farms with a high debt burden (over 40 percent of asset values) and positive net income (marginal solvency). This measure is down from 10 percent of farms in the mid-1980s to around 7 percent in 2009. This change in classif cation ref ects both the larger share of farms that report no yearend debt and the farms that do report debt use being in a less leveraged position. The substantial rise in asset values, particularly land, over the past two decades has contributed to the reduction in f nancial leverage borne by farms. Despite the recent global recession and continuing U.S. economywide credit problems, the f nancial health of the farm sector has been excellent in recent years. The farm sector's f nancial stability has been largely unaffected by the global f nancial crisis despite unstable input prices and variable output prices. However, given the widespread impacts of the global economic crisis, there have been concerns raised about the debt repayment ability of farmers and the future stability of asset values-especially for livestock farmers, whose net farm incomes declined in 2009 due to higher feed costs and weakened domestic and international demand. Questions about the impacts of changes in asset values and interest rates must take into account how they relate to farm business stress and debt at risk (see box, \"Estimating Debt at Risk\" for a description of how we measure such debt). A decline in farm asset values could raise concerns about f nancial stress since such assets represent the collateral security backing farm business loans. A rise in interest rates could raise concerns about the ability of borrowers to repay existing debt. Financial stress and debt repayment are intertwined since a common lender reaction to increasing f nancial stress or loan delinquencies is to tighten credit standards, including requiring greater collateral reserves. Thus far, while growing asset values (see chapter 4) have increased the value of collateral backing farm business loans, farm business debt at risk has been slowly rising since 2007. In this Special Article, we examine recent changes in various measures of troubled agricultural debt, the types of farm businesses currently experiencing f nancial stress, and the potential impact on debt repayment problems should farm businesses suddenly face decreases in the market value of farm assets or increases in interest rates. Before simulating the impacts of potential declines in asset values or increases in interest rates, we examine recent trends in debt at risk. Three sources of data are used: data from the Farm Credit System (FCS) and commercial banks (which together account for more than 85 percent of farm debt), and data from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS). Data for agricultural loans that are not paying their stated interest rate or are more than 90 days past due from the FCS, and delinquent and nonperforming loans from insured commercial banks show a 89-percent increase ($3.1 billion) in potential loan defaults in 2009 compared to 2008 (f g. 1). Since 2007, troubled farm debt reported by these two groups of lenders has more than triple, increasing by $4.6 billion. Nevertheless, the share of farm debt outstanding that is experiencing repayment problems remains relatively low (less than 4 percent), and farm business debt at risk estimates developed with ARMS data are forecast to decline slightly in 2010. If we compare the current situation in farming with that in the housing market, delinquency rates on housing loans are more than double the rates on farm loans. While the debt-at-risk estimates developed with ARMS data generally track movements in the amount of troubled agricultural debt reported by lending institutions, there are a number of reasons why these two measures differ. The results from ARMS ref ect only farm business earnings. When business earnings are insuff cient to service debt, farm operators often rely on income from other sources (such as off-farm jobs and businesses) to service their debt (see chapter 2 for a discussion of off-farm sources of income available to farm Using i nformation rep orted b y f arm bus inesses i n t he A gricultural R esource Management Survey (ARMS), we estimate the amount of \"debt at risk\" of delinquency or delayed/negotiated repayment. Farm businesses with negative equity (technically insolvent) pose the greatest risk of debt repayment diff culties, particularly when the farm does not have positive cash f ow from annual operations. So, the f rst component of our \"debt at risk\" estimate is the amount of debt owed by technically insolvent farms with negative farm business income. We use t he debt repayment capacity utilization (DRCU) measure described in chapter 4 to determine additional current debt in danger of not being repaid in a timely manner. The DRCU measures the amount of debt an operator can borrow based on existing net income and interest rates plus current existing principal and interest payments. In most cases, lenders become increasingly reluctant to lend to a farm operation when the minimum principal and interest payments on a ll the operation's debt exceed 80 percent of its income. Therefore, the second component of our debt at r isk measure is t he amount of current debt o bligations (interest and principal d ue i n t he c urrent ca lendar y ear) f or f arm bus inesses w ith a D RCU above 120 percent. households). Farm operators can also continue servicing their debt by liquidating current assets (or inventories). In addition, some of the discrepancy between the ARMS estimate of debt at risk and what is reported by commercial banks and the FCS may be attributed to other lenders (such as equipment dealers and input suppliers). There could also be a lag between when banks report delinquent loans and when we measure that potential based on annual survey data."}, {"section_title": "Estimating Debt at Risk", "text": "Financial stress is not evenly distributed among farm businesses. According to 2009 ARMS data, livestock farms held 55 percent of total farm business debt at risk. This included large shares held by dairy farms (24 percent) and beef cattle farms (18 percent). Dairy and beef farms (including feedlot activities) tend to have higher capital requirements than other types of farms. Among crop farms, specialty crop farms accounted for 17 percent and corn farms followed with 14 percent of total debt at risk (fi g. 2)."}, {"section_title": "Fixed vs. Variable Rate Loans", "text": "In the current economic environment, the prospects for a signifi cant increase in interest rates at some point in the near future are rising, if for no other reason than they are currently at historically low levels. The farm enterprises under greatest short-term risk are those holding variable rate loans. the highest average rate was 6.3 percent for variable rate loans adjusted at periods exceeding 1 year."}, {"section_title": "Potential Impact of Reductions in the Market Value of Farm Assets on Farm Business Debt-to-Asset Ratios", "text": "Given uncertainty in the current economic environment, there are concerns about the possibility of future declines in the value of farm assets. Such a decline would reduce agricultural collateral security. To evaluate how declining asset values could affect loan collateral, we examine the number of farms with debt-to-asset ratios greater than 40 percent. The debt-asset ratio measures the proportion of farm assets f nanced through debt. As the debt-asset ratio increases, farm operations are likely to face increasing diff culty securing additional debt obligations. We def ne higher leveraged farms as those with a debt-asset ratio above 40 percent and highly leveraged farms as those with a debt-asset ratio above 70 percent. Farms with a high debt-asset ratio are said to be \"highly leveraged\" and are particularly susceptible to f nancial diff culties if creditors demand repayment or credit market conditions suddenly change. In 2009, 66,000 farm businesses were highly leveraged. If farm asset values decline, the number of highly leveraged farm businesses will increase, holding debt levels constant. Figure 4 shows the estimated impact of a 10-, 20-and 30-percent decrease in the value of farm assets. The number of farm businesses with debt-asset ratios between 41 and 70 percent increases by 4.4, 20.0, and 33.3 percent respectively given a 10-, 20-, or 30-percent reduction in farm asset values. The share of farms with the largest susceptibility to loan repayment issues, those with a debt-asset ratio above 70 percent, increases more dramatically, by 4.8, 42.9, and 90.5 percent, respectively. Therefore, holding all other things equal, a reduction in asset values greatly increases immediate concerns of solvency for more farm businesses and lenders. Increasing numbers of highly leveraged farm businesses are \"at risk\" if lenders demand repayment or farm businesses have to obtain   new loans. However, for the 59 percent of farms that had no debt in 2009, there is no change in the value of their debt-to-asset ratio. Nonetheless, they could be affected by reduced equity and increased collateral requirements for future loans. Figure 5 shows the number of farm businesses with debt at risk, as measured by a debt repayment capacity utilization ratio exceeding 120 percent (see box, \"Estimating Debt at Risk\"). Figure 5 suggests that increasing interest rates on variable rate loans would have only a modest immediate impact on the number of farms experiencing f nancial stress (holding everything else constant). In the extreme case, if interest rates increased from 6 percent to 12 percent, the number of farms with \"at risk debt\" would increase by roughly 5 percent for farms that owe more than half of their current debt as variable rate loans. In essence, if interest rates on variable rate loans increase, higher principal and interest payments are required to service existing debt. This means that an increasing number of farm businesses would be unable to meet debt service requirements out of current business income, putting their debt \"at risk.\" The 59 percent of farm businesses with no debt in 2009 would not be affected immediately but could face higher interest rates for future loans. Farms with debt at f xed interest rates would also not be affected immediately but could face higher rates on new or consolidated loans.  An increase in interest rates yields modest short-term changes in farm debt repayment capacity  \u2022 USDA's s hort-term f arm-income f orecast m odel had mea n f orecast errors for cash re ceipts i n 20 09 ra nging f rom 0.02 percent for crop receipts to 16.83 percent for livestock receipts."}, {"section_title": "Potential Impacts of Changes in Interest Rates on Debt At Risk", "text": "\u2022 Forecast er rors f or t he f arm-level pa rtial-budgeting m odel, us ing ARMS data, decreased in magnitude from 7.3 percent in 2005 to 5.5 percent in 2009, showing a more accurate forecast. \u2022 The 20 06-to-2008 co mmodity-price boo m pro bably a ffected f orecasts in following years. The USDA short-term farm-income forecast model forecasts receipts for individual commodities, Government payments, and production expenses. The model operates on individual farm-level data from the most recent NASS data available to ERS. Agriculture can be severely affected by many factors, as any farmer knows, and thus the difference between the initial forecast of annual income and the initial estimate, which are released 18 months apart, can be large. The model creates quarterly forecasts of individual commodity items and annual forecasts of various production expenses, noncommodity items, and Government payments. It also forecasts annual prices-paid indexes, used principally in forecasting production expenses. To measure commodity output, it uses a T\u00f6rnqvist output index model. See box, \"The ERS Short-Term Farm Income Forecast Model\" for a basic description of the forecast model. The model is explained in depth in \"Forecasting Farm Income: Documenting USDA's Forecast Model,\" http://www.ers.usda.gov/Publications/TB1924/. The purpose of reviewing forecasting accuracy is to determine and discuss trends and events that have inf uenced prices and quantities of agricultural inputs and outputs, such as economic or weather changes affecting production. The last review of forecast accuracy was completed for the Agricultural Income and Finance Outlook, 2006Edition, http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/ usda/ers/AIS//2000s/2006/AIS-11-30-2006.pdf. Forecast performance in three areas-commodity items, production expenses, and farm-income measures-are examined from 2005 to 2009. Finally, the trends and events that have inf uenced variations between the initial forecast and the initial estimate are discussed.

The 12-month average annual prices paid indexes published by USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) will also be substituted for the forecasts in the model. The ERS Short-Term Farm Income Forecast Model are for intermediate and commercial farms. Across the selected components for all farm businesses in 2009, forecast errors ranged from 1.4 percent for crop receipts to 6.8 percent for livestock receipts. Forecast errors derive from two sources. First, they can result from different outcomes than the index ref ecting quantity and price changes predicts for the sector as a whole. They can also result from the static nature of the partial budgeting model where farms adapt and/or structural changes occur from one survey year to the next. The forecast model was more accurate in 2009 than in 2005, with the mean magnitude for forecast error for All Farms, Commercial Farms, Intermediate Farms, All Farm Businesses, and Rural Residence Farms decreasing from 7.3 percent in 2005 to 5.5 percent in 2009. Appendix f gure A-1 shows the percentage error by resource region. The greatest percentage forecast errors occurred in resource regions with smaller shares of farms or businesses, such as the Mississippi Portal and Basin and Range regions, suggesting that a smaller sample survey size leads to greater forecast errors in those regions. The more accurate percentage forecast errors occurred in regions with greater shares of U.S. farms and farm businesses (and larger sample survey sizes), such as the Heartland, Northern Crescent, Fruitful Rim, and Prairie Gateway.
