FGF21 is mainly produced by the liver but also by other tissues including white adipose tissue (WAT), skeletal muscle, and pancreatic b cells (Beenken & Mohammadi 2009 ). FGF21 is regulated by nutritional status and influences glucose and lipid metabolism by central and peripheral mechanisms (Kralisch & Fasshauer 2011) . Thus, the protein induces glucose uptake (Kharitonenkov et al. 2005) and decreases glucose and lipid concentrations in obese mice (Kharitonenkov et al. 2005) and diabetic monkeys (Kharitonenkov et al. 2007) . Furthermore, it increases energy expenditure resulting in weight loss (Coskun et al. 2008) and upregulates fatty acid oxidation (Inagaki et al. 2007 ). These results suggest that FGF21 regulates energy balance and improves glucose homeostasis. Furthermore, FGF21 is also considered to be a starvation signal and is additionally involved in the process of 'browning' of WAT (Cant\u00f3 & Auwerx 2012) .\nAt the cellular level, FGF21 mediates its effects through cell surface receptors composed of the classic four FGF receptor (FGFR) isotypes 1-4 (Zhang et al. 2006) . FGFRs are tyrosine kinases that are complexed selectively and non-covalently with an essential co-receptor b-Klotho, forming an FGF21-b-Klotho-FGFR complex (Ogawa et al. 2007) . Expression of FGF21 is controlled by various transcriptional activators such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) a in the liver (Badman et al. 2007) and PPARg in the adipocytes (Wang et al. 2008) .\nSeveral clinical studies investigated the role of FGF21 in human metabolic disease. Thus, high baseline FGF21 serum levels predicted the risk to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) over 5.4 years (odds ratio 1.792; P!0.01) together with waist circumference and fasting plasma glucose levels in 1.200 nondiabetic Chinese subjects (Chen et al. 2011) . Recent data indicate that higher FGF21 serum levels are associated with abnormal fasting glucose and insulin resistance in the Baltimore longitudinal study of aging (Semba et al. 2012) . Furthermore, a study by Lin et al. (2012) suggested that FGF21 potentially regulates insulin secretion in humans. In contrast to the study by Semba et al. (2012) , FGF21 levels were inversely correlated with changes in serum glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test with lowest FGF21 concentrations after 1 h and a peak at 3 h (Lin et al. 2012) . This acute response appears to be abolished in patients with impaired glucose tolerance and T2DM (Lin et al. 2012) . FGF21 concentrations were increased in obese children in comparison with lean controls and were related to leptin and free fatty acids (FFAs; Reinehr et al. 2012) . Furthermore, FGF21 is considered as a potential marker of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD; Dushay et al. 2010 , Yilmaz et al. 2010 . Moreover, a correlation of serum FGF21 levels with GH and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) concentrations is discussed (Inagaki et al. 2008 . In agreement with this hypothesis, FGF21 levels are negatively associated with IGF1 independent of body fat and insulin resistance in patients with anorexia nervosa (Fazeli et al. 2010) .\nTo date, no study with sufficient statistical power has included gender, renal function, metabolic, hepatic, and vascular risk markers combined in its analysis of FGF21 serum concentration. Therefore, the aim of our cross-sectional study was to assess the complex interaction of these clinical parameters, as well as GH status, with FGF21 levels in a large well-characterized sample."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "All subjects are part of a sample from an extensively phenotyped self-contained population of Sorbs from Eastern Germany described in more detail recently (Tonjes et al. 2009 (Tonjes et al. , 2010 (Tonjes et al. , 2012 .

Interestingly, in four independent experiments, FGF21 significantly inhibited IGF1 secretion into the HepG2 cell culture supernatants from 0.089 ng/ml (basal) to 0.062 ng/ml (P!0.05) (Fig. 2) . Total protein content in the supernatants was not significantly different between control and FGF21-treated cells (data not shown)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In the current study, we demonstrate for the first time that FGF21 is negatively and independently associated with IGF1 in unselected nondiabetic subjects. A negative association between FGF21 and IGF1 has also been observed in patients with anorexia nervosa independent from body fat and insulin resistance (Fazeli et al. 2010) . It is interesting to note in this context that FGF21 inhibits IGF1 production in a human hepatocyte cell model in vitro in our study. However, it needs to be emphasized that dose-response, time-course, and signaling experiments are necessary to more thoroughly establish the link between FGF21 and IGF1 secretion from hepatocytes. Our results suggest that FGF21 directly and negatively impacts IGF1 production. This hypothesis is further supported by recent independent data from Inagaki et al. (2008) . The authors demonstrate convincingly that FGF21 reduces levels of active form of STAT5, a major mediator of GH action, in the liver of mice in vivo. FGF21-mediated suppression of STAT5 is accompanied by decreases in the expression of its target genes including IGF1 (Inagaki et al. 2008) . Furthermore, FGF21 induces hepatic expression of IGF1 binding protein 1 and suppressor of cytokine signaling 2, both of which impair GH signaling (Inagaki et al. 2008) . In agreement with a GH signaling-suppressive effect, chronic FGF21 treatment significantly inhibits growth in mice (Inagaki et al. 2008) . Furthermore, these findings are in accordance with the investigations in FGF21 knockout animals (Kubicky et al. 2012) . Here, FGF21-deficient mice exhibit greater body and tibial growth during starvation compared with WT littermates, and daily injections of recombinant human FGF21 in a subgroup of foodrestricted knockout mice prevent this phenotype (Kubicky et al. 2012) . Interestingly, GH binding and GH receptor expression are reduced in the liver and in the growth plate of food-restricted compared with ad libitum-fed WT mice whereas they are similar between food-restricted and ad libitum-fed FGF21-deficient animals. Taking these results into consideration, our present data are in accordance with the hypothesis that FGF21 and IGF1 are not only significantly and negatively associated but that FGF21 directly downregulates IGF1 as well as impairs GH signaling in the liver.\nIn the current study, we demonstrate that FGF21 serum levels are positively associated with hepatic enzymes including ASAT, ALAT, aP, and gGT. Furthermore, the association between FGF21 and gGT remains independent in multivariate analysis. As gGT is a surrogate parameter of fatty liver degeneration, our results are in accordance with the hypothesis that circulating FGF21 is positively associated with metabolic liver disease including NAFLD (Tyynismaa et al. 2010) . In agreement with this notion, FGF21 upregulation has also been demonstrated in recent independent studies using selected NAFLD patient populations (Dushay et al. 2010 , Shen et al. 2012 . One potential mechanism contributing to FGF21 upregulation in NAFLD is hepatic FGF21 resistance , Shen et al. 2012 . In an elegant study, Fisher et al. (2010) demonstrate that FGF21 signaling is attenuated in liver and WAT of diet-induced obese mice, with a fourfold increase in FGF21 serum levels compared with control animals. It needs to be elucidated in future studies whether FGF21 can be used as a biomarker for NAFLD and whether this cytokine is a causal factor of this condition. One limitation of the currently available clinical studies is the lack of liver biopsies to reliably differentiate NAFLD from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.\nIn this study, we demonstrate that FGF21 is positively and independently correlated with facets of the metabolic syndrome including obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia in nondiabetic subjects. Relationship between serum FGF21, IGF1, and gGT. FGF21 serum levels are depicted depending on IGF1 (low: 0-125 ng/ml; medium: 125-200 ng/ml; and high: O200 ng/ml) and gGT (low: 0-0.25 mkat/l; medium: 0.25-0.5 mkat/l; and high: O0.5 mkat/l) values. Only nondiabetic subjects with FGF21 values above the detection limit of the FGF21 ELISA were included (total nZ670).\nIn agreement with this notion, circulating FGF21 is increased in T2DM compared with nondiabetic controls in our study population. Furthermore, nondiabetic subjects with FGF21 levels below the detection limit of the FGF21 ELISA show a more beneficial metabolic profile compared with subjects with detectable FGF21 concentrations. These data strongly suggest that FGF21 increases with deteriorating metabolic control. Our data are in accordance with recent findings from independent groups. Thus, circulating FGF21 levels in obese subjects are significantly higher compared with lean individuals (Zhang et al. 2008) . Furthermore, serum FGF21 correlates positively with adiposity, fasting insulin, and TG and negatively with HDL-cholesterol after adjusting for age and BMI similar to our results (Zhang et al. 2008) . Moreover, FGF21 is independently associated with insulin resistance and increased in T2DM in adults from the Baltimore longitudinal study of aging (Semba et al. 2012 ). In addition, Chen et al. (2011) demonstrate an independent association between serum FGF21 levels on one hand and TG, LDL-cholesterol, and SBP on the other hand in Chinese individuals using multiple linear regression analysis. Consistent with these findings, FGF21 significantly and positively correlates with markers of insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in univariate and multivariate analyses in gestational diabetes mellitus patients in a study from our group (Stein et al. 2010) . Mechanistically, elevated FFAs might contribute to FGF21 upregulation when facets of the metabolic disease are present (Mai et al. 2010) . To date, the physiological significance for increased FGF21 in metabolic disease is unclear. Paradoxical upregulation of FGF21 might be a compensatory mechanism to improve glucose metabolism when obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance, and an adverse lipid profile are present. Alternatively, the metabolic syndrome might cause resistance to FGF21 leading to compensatory upregulation of this antidiabetic cytokine as proposed by Fisher et al. (2010) . Clearly, more work is needed to better elucidate the pathophysiological significance of FGF21 upregulation in metabolic disease states. Despite the independent association between FGF21 and metabolic parameters, FGF21 is not independently correlated with IMT, a surrogate parameter of atherosclerosis. To our knowledge, IMT has not been included in studies on circulating FGF21 so far. In contrast to our findings, FGF21 concentrations are increased in coronary heart disease patients (Lin et al. 2010) . However, coronary heart disease and control groups were not matched for blood pressure, HOMA-IR, and inflammation in this study (Lin et al. 2010) . Taking these findings into consideration, it is tempting to speculate that FGF21 is an independent predictor of metabolic but not vascular disease.\nInterestingly, the current study population does not show an independent association of circulating FGF21 with renal function assessed by serum creatinine and GFR. These findings are in contrast to a recent report suggesting that FGF21 serum levels are progressively increased from the early to end stages of chronic kidney disease and are associated with renal function in a Chinese cohort (Lin et al. 2011) . Furthermore, median FGF21 concentrations are O15-fold higher in hemodialysis patients compared with subjects with a GFR O50 ml/min (Stein et al. 2009 ). Moreover, serum creatinine positively and GFR negatively predict circulating FGF21 in multiple regression analyses in control subjects (Stein et al. 2009 ). Similarly, Han et al. (2010) demonstrated that FGF21 levels were eightfold higher in 72 nondiabetic patients receiving peritoneal dialysis compared with controls. Our findings are in agreement with the hypothesis that circulating FGF21 is increased only in more severe stages of renal dysfunction.\nRecent studies indicate that FGF21 might mediate glucagon effects. Thus, hepatic FGF21 expression is upregulated by hepatic glucagon receptor activation in a manner that is further augmented by fatty acids. Furthermore, FGF21 preserves b-cell function and survival by stimulating p44/42 mitogen-activated protein and Akt signaling pathways. Moreover, FGF21 lowers glucagon in mice (Iglesias et al. 2012) . Unfortunately, glucagon could not be quantified within our study, and, therefore, the relationship between FGF21 and glucagon could not be determined. Strengths of our study include the high number of subjects, the broad range of phenotypical features, as well as the genetically homogeneous, self-contained population of Sorbs. A limitation of the study is the crosssectional design and, therefore, causality cannot be established. Furthermore, our clinical study by necessity only measures circulating FGF21. Therefore, our study does not provide information on whether local FGF21 production in liver and adipose tissue is associated with circulating FGF21, as well as with facets of the metabolic syndrome.\nTaken together, we demonstrate that FGF21 serum concentrations are associated with facets of the metabolic syndrome, hepatocellular function, as well as GH status. Additional studies are necessary to better elucidate the physiological significance of these findings."}, {"section_title": "Declaration of interest", "text": "The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest that could be perceived as prejudicing the impartiality of the research reported."}, {"section_title": "Funding", "text": "Financial support was received from the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), Germany, FKZ: 01EO1001 (IFB AdiposityDiseases, project K7-9 to M F, K7-37 and K403 to A T, K7-35 and K7-36 to M S), the German Research Council (KFO-152 to M B, M F, and M S), the Interdisciplinary Center for Clinical Research, University of Leipzig (B25 to M F; B27 to A T, P K and M S), the Deutsche Hochdruckliga e.V.
