We next analyzed the association in 259 amyloid-\u03b2 positive (A\u03b2+) elders and 117 amyloid-\u03b2 negative (A\u03b2\u2212) elders (A\u03b2+: CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 \u2264 192 pg/ml; A\u03b2\u2212: CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 > 192 pg/ml). Associations were tested using multiple linear regression models at baseline. Furthermore, multiple mixed-effects models were used in a longitudinal study which lasted 4 years.\nResults: At baseline, we found that rs9357347 had association with CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 in CN group (\u03b2 = 0.357, P = 0.009). In AD group, rs9357347 was associated with total tau (T-tau) level (\u03b2 = \u22120.436, P = 0.007).

In the genetic studies, the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) gene cluster on chromosome 6p21.11 has been identified as significantly associated gene region with AD (Karch et al., 2014) . Among the TREM genes, a rare variant rs75932628 (encoding p. Arg47His) in TREM2 was reported to be associated with the highest risk of developing AD in Caucasians (Colonna, 2003; Piccio et al., 2007) .\nRecently, Carrasquillo et al. (2017) re-analyzed whole genome and exome sequencing data to test which common AD-related variants within the TREM gene cluster influence AD through gene expression. rs9357347, located downstream from TREML2 and upstream from TREM2, was found to be associated with AD risk (Carrasquillo et al., 2017) . And the locus was demonstrated to influence TREML1 and TREM2 expression in the temporal cortex (Ford and McVicar, 2009 ). Meanwhile, they found that only TREM2 and TREML1 had reliable expression in the brain region. Thus, they point out that rs9357347 CC exerts protective effects on AD through increasing TREML1 and TREM2 brain expression levels. However, the specific pathogenic effect rs9357347 exerts on AD remains unclear. Therefore, the current study was to test associations of rs9357347 with AD-related cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging markers in the population from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Design and Participants", "text": "Data used in this study were obtained from the ADNI database led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD, which is a public-private partnership, launched in 2003. The main goal of ADNI has been to test whether clinical and cognitive assessment, positron emission tomography (PET), CSF, serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and other biological markers can be combined to evaluate the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants or their guardians before test samples being drawn. The institutional review boards of all sites participating in the ADNI provided review and approval of the ADNI data collection protocol. For more details, see www.adni-info.org.\nOur ADNI cohort consisted of available baseline and longitudinal AD-related marker samples from all cognitively normal (CN) elders, patients with MCI, and patients with AD dementia. Inclusion or exclusion criteria are described in detail on pages 20-22 of the online ADNI protocol. Briefly, all subjects were aged from 55 to 90 years old, kept contact with their study partners 10 h per week or more, had completed at least six grades of education or had a good employment history, spoke English or Spanish fluently, and were removed of any significant neurological disease other than AD (Petersen et al., 2010) . Any history of head trauma or brain lesions, any serious neurological disease other than probable AD, and any psychoactive medication use that could otherwise account for the deterioration in memory and related symptoms must be excluded (Jagust et al., 2009; Weigand et al., 2011) .\nWe used two classification criteria for the 722 ADNI samples to study the association of rs9357347 allele with AD dementia. One is clinical classification (AD, MCI, CN groups) which includes 201 CN older adults, 349 elders with MCI, and 172 elders with AD dementia. And another is pathological classification classifying the subjects into two groups according to previously established cutoff. It has been shown that individuals with CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 levels less than 192 pg/ml in the ADNI cohort have evidence of A\u03b2 1\u221242 deposition in the brain, as detected by PET-PIB (Fagan et al., 2007; Mattsson et al., 2009) . Individuals with CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 levels below these thresholds (CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 \u2264 192 pg/ml) could be classified as A\u03b2-positive (A\u03b2+), otherwise (CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 > 192 pg/ml) they will be classified as A\u03b2-negative (A\u03b2\u2212) (Olsson et al., 2005; Jack et al., 2008; Shaw et al., 2009 ).

Preparation of aliquots (0.5 ml) from these samples was done after unfreezing (60 min) at room temperature and gentle mixing (Weigand et al., 2011) . The aliquots were stored in bar code-labeled polypropylene vials at \u221280 \u2022 C . The multiplex platform (xMAP; Luminex Corporation) with a kit (INNO-BIA AlzBio3; Fujirebio Europe) was used for simultaneous measurement of the CSF protein biomarkers such as A\u03b2 1\u221242 , total tau (T-tau), and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (P-tau 181).

We found statistically significant associations with both A\u03b2 1\u221242 and tau in CSF (at baseline and longitudinally). Specifically, we reported that rs9357347 was mainly associated with CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 in CN participants; in AD participants, the mutation was detected to be negatively associated with CSF T-tau, which is consistent with the result in A\u03b2+ group; the association between the locus and CSF P-tau 181 was also found in AD group longitudinally.\nTo sum up, our results were in line with the hypothetical model that relates disease stage to AD biomarkers, in which CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 biomarkers become abnormal first and then the neurodegenerative biomarkers (Hardy and Selkoe, 2002; Dennis and Selkoe, 2016) . This suggests that there is an association of rs9357347 with brain amyloidosis and tau pathology of AD. This finding may supply clues to the protective role of rs9357347 against AD risk. Previous studies have proposed a mechanism by which genetic variation in TREM2 alters amyloid pathology. First of all, TREM2 is a cell surface receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily, which is expressed nearly exclusively on microglia within the central nervous system (CNS) (Zheng et al., 2016) . Second, in CNS, TREM2 signaling is intimately linked with the adapter protein, DAP12 (also known as TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein, TYROBP) (Li and Zhang, 2018) . TREM2 deficiency is associated with decreased bacterial clearance and increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production, thus suggesting the anti-inflammatory and protective functions of TREM2 (Zheng et al., 2016) . The number of myeloid cells around amyloid plaques was decreased in TREM2 hemizygous mutations showed that a loss of TREM2 function results in reduced A\u03b2 1\u221242 uptake (Yuan et al., 2016) . Further, a previous study found that microglia became more active to remove amyloid plaques after TREM2 overexpression, and the density of amyloid plaques in the brain reduced in middle-aged APP/ PS1 mice (7-8 months old) (Jiang et al., 2014) . Condello et al. (2018) postulated that the microglia around the amyloid surface limits fibril outgrowth and plaqueassociated toxicity.\nMany of studies suggested that TREM2 participates in AD pathogenesis through intraneuronal deposition of phosphorylated tau besides A\u03b2 1\u221242 deposition and clearance (Jay et al., 2015; Jiang et al., 2015 Jiang et al., , 2018 . Tau pathology in the CNS, current is involved in a series of neurodegenerative disorders including AD (Medina and Avila, 2014) . Therefore, regulation of tau pathology may be an impactful approach to delaying the AD development. Mutations in TREM2 have been suggested to be correlated with tau pathology in AD. Lill et al. (2015) reported that a variant of TREM2 (rs75932628) significantly increased the accumulation of CSF T-tau in a European population, which suggested that TREM2's role in AD may involve neuronal degeneration. additionally, the overexpression of TREM2 has been found to significantly enhance hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins (Lill et al., 2015) . Consequently, TREM2 overexpression significantly improves neuronal loss and may play a role in the phosphorylation of tau protein, thereby improving the incidence of AD. Of note, inflammatory stimuli in the brain have also been proved to be associated with accelerating tau phosphorylation (Jiang et al., 2016) . Since tau phosphorylation would be accelerated resulting from reduced TREM2 levels suggesting that TREM2 act as an anti-inflammatory factor. In the light of our result, we can hypothesize that the upregulation of TREM2 driven by the rs9357347-C allele serves as a compensatory response to A\u03b2 1\u221242 and tau and subsequently protects against AD progression.\nCurrently, TREML1 (also named as TLT-1) has been identified as a myeloid receptor expressed exclusively in the \u03b1-granules of megakaryocytes and platelets (Washington et al., 2004) . TREML1 was proved to antagonize proinflammatory activation of TREM1 by competing with its ligand (Derive et al., 2012) . Besides, soluble TREML1 has also been shown to play an antiinflammatory role. Meanwhile, TREML1 levels in the brain have reported to have association with decreased AD risk in humans (Carrasquillo et al., 2017) suggesting that upregulated expression of TREML1 may be protective against AD. Nevertheless, as we all know, no variant in TREML1 is currently exerted to associated with AD (Derive et al., 2012) . For that reason, our results that rs9357347 exerted a significant effect on AD by modulating CSF biomarkers including A\u03b2 1\u221242 , T-tau, and P-tau 181 has thrown light on the hypothesis about the mechanism through which TREML1 modifies AD risk, which still needs further investigation.\nOur findings were consistent with the results of Carrasquillo et al. (2017) that rs9357347 has functional influence on AD and may indicated the role that rs9357347 played on protection from AD. The study demonstrated that the locus was associated with the level of A\u03b2 and tau. Thus far, it has been identified that both A\u03b2 and tau pathology could lead to neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration (Jack et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2015) . Many studies suggested that TREM2's role in AD may involve tau dysfunction and A\u03b2deposition (Lill et al., 2015; Zheng et al., 2016) . All the above evidence, along with our findings, supported that rs9357347 mediated AD risk by modulating the alteration of the amyloid-\u03b2 pathology and neuronal degeneration biomarkers. Although our results showed evidence that A\u03b2 1\u221242 and tau response were in part mediated through rs9357347, there remained a possibility that tau effects may be also derived from an imbalance between A\u03b2 1\u221242 production and clearance (Hardy and Selkoe, 2002; Selkoe and Hardy, 2016) . A detailed analysis of the potential significance of secondary changes is indeed interesting, so future studies are needed to robustly identify the locus for the associations with A\u03b2 1\u221242 and tau pathology."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "In summary, our findings confirmed that the rs9357347 CC exerted a protective effect on AD by decreasing the A\u03b2 1\u221242 accumulation and tau burden.
