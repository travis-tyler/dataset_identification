Estimation of the global population size of North American landbirds was intended to (1) identify the degree of vulnerability of each species, (2) provide estimates of the current population size for each species, and (3) provide a starting point for estimating population sizes in states, provinces, territories, and Bird Conservation Regions (Rich et al. 2004) . A method proposed by Rosenberg and Blancher (2005) was used to derive population estimates from available survey data.

Such eff orts o\u011e en involve se\u0134 ing population goals, using models to predict changes in bird population size as a function of habitat (and other) variables, developing plans to modify habitats through management, and using survey data to monitor progress toward goals. Unfortunately, integrating our present sources of information on bird populations into this system is complicated by the nature of the data 8 An index is a statistic (e.g., point count or relative abundance measure) that is assumed to be correlated with the actual quantity of interest (e.g., population size or density). Understanding the relationship between counts and population sizes at sample sites by estimating the proportion of animals counted (detection rate) has been an important focus of wildlife statistics (e.g., Nichols et al. 2000 , Buckland et al. 2001 . For bird surveys, indices o\u011e en are not based on probabilistic samples, which introduces an additional source of uncertainty (e.g., count locations may not sample all possible locations representatively). For the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), for example, data from roadside point counts are frequently criticized because they may be poor indices of the number of birds at count locations and may not be representative of bird populations within regions because of the nature of roadside counts (Bibby et al. 1992) . Historically, these factors were o\u011e en ignored in analyses that made strong but unstated assumptions about the consistency of indices and randomness of samples. Modern analyses of BBS indices a\u0134 empt to limit the infl uence of inconsistent indices by controlling for site-specifi c diff erences in detection (e.g., through observable covariates; Link and Sauer 1998); no analyses presently control for the roadside nature of the sample. Comparisons of indices of abundance among species also may be fl awed if species diff er in their detectability; and if detection rates also diff er among habitats, use of survey data in bird-habitat models used in developing population and habitat objectives may be invalid. Each of these diffi culties in the use of index data can potentially result in inappropriate conservation decisions.\nAny analysis of index data thus can be criticized by postulating diff erences in detection rates among treatments. These concerns have motivated conservationists to avoid direct use of relative abundance indices in conservation planning, and instead to include in their plans estimates of species-specifi c population sizes that incorporate estimates of detection rates. These population size estimates are then used in models as parts of objective functions for se\u0134 ing goals for the number of birds in relation to available habitat, or used to predict the total amount of habitat that must be conserved or created to support speciesspecifi c numerical population goals.\nThis interest in making estimates of population numbers and density by habitat has previously led to development of several national and continental estimates of bird population sizes. For instance, McAtee (1931) estimated that there were 2.6 billion breeding landbirds in the contiguous United States, and Wing (1956) estimated that 5.6 billion birds were present in the United States in summer and 3.75 billion in winter. The American Ornithologists' Union (1975) once suggested that as many as 10 billion birds were present in the contiguous United States in each breeding season, with a fall population of 20 billion.\nEstimates of population size as opposed to indices may be especially useful in conservation because they resonate with the public; they impart meaning not generally found in indices, contributing to impressive statements about the magnitude of conservation problems. For Rich et al. (2004, appendix B) and Rosenberg and Blancher (2005) described their method for estimating species-specifi c population size from survey data (herea\u011e er referred to as the \"Rosenberg and Blancher\" approach). Two procedures were used, one for birds largely restricted to the United States and Canada south of the Arctic and the other for birds present in the Canadian Arctic. Survey data available for estimating population sizes for these two areas diff er in several important aspects. For the United States and sub-Arctic Canada, North American BBS data were used, whereas for the Canadian Arctic, data from the Breeding Bird Census (BBC) and Northwest Territories-Nunavut Bird Checklist Survey (Checklist) were used. For the BBS data, counts from acceptable routes were averaged for the 1990s for each species recorded on a route. For regions where BBS routes were infrequently run (boreal forest portions of Canada), routes from other decades were included. Numbers of birds by species were averaged for every route in geopolitical regions formed by the intersection of state-province-territory and Bird Conservation Region boundaries. Averages from neighboring regions were assigned if the geopolitical region was not sampled by BBS. Averages from each geopolitical region were divided by the area presumed to be covered by a BBS route (25.1 km 2 ) and multiplied by the area of the region. Bird Conservation Region indices were calculated by summing over all geopolitical regions within a Bird Conservation Region. These Bird Conservation Region-wide indices were converted to population estimates a\u011e er multiplying the indices by three adjustments (Rosenberg and Blancher's adjustment factors).\nThe three adjustments were a \"pair\" adjustment, a detection-area adjustment, and a timeof-day adjustment. The pair adjustment led to the indices being multiplied by two, with the assumptions that BBS observers typically detect the male of a species and that all birds are paired with a single female. The detection-area adjustment was the square of the ratio between the theoretical detection radius for the BBS (i.e., 400 m) and one of fi ve eff ective detection T\u044e\u044f\u0459\u0452 2. Estimated sources of annual avian mortality associated with human activity in North America (not limited to landbirds), in order of estimated magnitude. Klem (1990) distances (80, 125, 200, 400 , and 800 m) assigned to each species (Table 3) . This adjustment ostensibly accounted for incomplete detection \u2264400 m or detection at distances >400 m. Breeding Bird Survey protocol precludes including birds beyond 400 m from the survey stop in the stop count, but the 800-m detection distance was presumed to accommodate those species (e.g., soaring birds, such as the vultures) for which movement was possible from one stop to another during the course of the survey. The time-of-day adjustment was the ratio of counts at the peak of detection to the average count over the whole set of BBS routes (Table 4 ). The form of the calculation incorporating all three adjustment factors is as follows:\n( 1) where Y is a BBS count reported for route j in year i for a particular species, n is the number of years of acceptable route counts during 1990\u22121999 (\u226410), m is the number of routes in the geopolitical region, g is the number of geographic strata, area is the area of the geopolitical region, d e is the eff ective detection distance, count peak is a smoothed estimate of the maximum count, derived from a sixth-order polynomial fi t, X is a BBS count summed over each stop in the mid-1990s through 2001 period, and rte*yrs is the number of routes over the period. For birds occupying three ecozones in Arctic Canada, BBC data provided estimates of total landbird density. Total landbird density was split among three classes of landbirds on the basis of their likely detection distance: near, intermediate, and far. Relative species-specifi c abundance was calculated from Checklist data. The ratio of BBC total landbird density to Checklist abundance was calculated, and this density conversion factor was applied to the Checklist abundance data to provide species-specifi c density estimates. These bird densities were averaged within each ecoregion, then multiplied by the area of the region to derive a population estimate. Population estimates were summed across ecoregions to provide a total population estimate for each Arctic landbird species.\nThe two estimates were summed for those species that occurred in both Arctic and nonArctic regions to derive continental estimates of population size. Global population sizes were simply the United States-Canada population size multiplied by the ratio of the total breeding range to that in the United States and Canada. [Auk, Vol. 123 proportion to its occurrence in each region, (2) birds present but not counted during the BBS were accounted for by one or more of the adjustment factors, (3) the Checklist-BBC data for birds in Arctic Canada were comparable to BBS data, and (4) breeding densities in the United States and Canada were comparable to densities outside the United States and Canada (this la\u0134 er assumption was relevant only to the extrapolation of North American population size to global estimates of population size). The panel focused primarily on evaluating the fi rst two assumptions, because they apparently have the greatest eff ect on most population size estimates. Bias related to habitat sampling in the Breeding Bird Survey.-Two issues, placement of routes and roadside eff ects, are critical in determining the correctness of the assumption that habitat was sampled by the BBS in approximate proportion to its occurrence in the regional landscape. Intensity and placement of BBS routes dictate whether the habitat was properly sampled. Unfortunately, BBS coverage is limited both by routes that are infrequently surveyed and by large roadless areas that are not sampled within the United States and Canada (Peterjohn 1994 , O'Connor et al. 2000 . These gaps in coverage may lead to over-or undersampling of particular habitats poorly represented along roadsides. For instance, mountaintops, western riparian areas, and large wetlands are o\u011e en poorly represented in the BBS (Robbins et al. 1986) . Unpublished studies by the late R. J. O'Connor (University of Maine, Orono) and colleagues, C. Flather (U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service), and P. J. Blancher (Canadian Wildlife Service) suggest that the eff ect of atypical route placement is minor, but no comprehensive test of this eff ect has been conducted (O'Connor et al. 2000) .\nBecause the BBS is a roadside survey, another consideration is the infl uence of roads on measures of bird abundance through their eff ect on the habitat itself or on bird behavior. Forman (2000) indicated that 20% of the United States is aff ected by roads. Habitat along roadsides may not be representative of roadless habitat (Miller et al. 1996, Trombulak and Frissell 2000) and, thus, may support a diff erent proportion of a species' population than would occur in roadless habitat. Some birds may be a\u0134 racted to features associated with roads, whereas others may be repelled (Forman and Deblinger 2000) . It is unclear how these eff ects introduce bias in BBS data (Hu\u0134 o et al. 1995 , Keller and Fuller 1995 , Rotenberry and Knick 1995 .\nBias because of inadequacy in three adjustment factors.-The second assumption of the population estimation approach was that birds present but not counted during the BBS were accounted for by one or more of the adjustment factors. As noted by Link and Sauer (1998:261) , \"BBS sampling cannot guarantee either a census or a known fi xed area of sampling.\" Any connection of the BBS index to a population size must account for these uncertainties; the most important issue faced by the panel was the credibility of the assumptions implicit in the T\u044e\u044f\u0459\u0452 4. Examples of time-of-day adjustment factors used in deriving population estimates from North American Breeding Bird Survey data. modeled corrections proposed by Rosenberg and Blancher (2005) . Many uncertainties exist in these correction factors, and we describe a variety of issues that could infl uence the quality and precision of these corrections. We also identify the importance of estimating precision of both the corrections and resulting population sizes.\nThe fi rst adjustment factor was a \"pair\" adjustment factor. Ostensibly, the pair adjustment multiplied the index (average number of birds per route in the 1990s by geopolitical region) by two, on the assumption that only one member of a pair was detected on a BBS route. This adjustment factor does not account for unpaired, and largely uncounted, \"fl oater\" birds. Kenwood and Paxton (2001) , for instance, suspected that as many as 36% of the Southwestern Willow Flycatchers (Empidonax traillii extimus) at their Arizona study site were unpaired fl oaters. Also, nocturnal and crepuscular species, early-and late-season breeders, quiet species, and temporary immigrants are poorly counted by the BBS (Robbins et al. 1989 , O'Connor et al. 2000 and, thus, may not be accounted for by multiplication by two. Although it is a species not well covered by the BBS, estimates for the Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus), for instance, suggested that as many as 40-50% of the birds in a population were nonterritorial fl oaters (Rohner 1997). Unfortunately, the relationship of perceptible birds to undetectable birds in BBS results is generally unknown; the pair adjustment may be conservative (i.e., result in an underestimate) for some species, but also may overestimate overly conspicuous species and those species in which individuals of both sexes vocalize.\nThe second adjustment factor was intended to address species-specifi c detection probabilities by assigning each species to one of fi ve detection-distance categories (80, 125, 200, 400, and 800 m) and, in doing so, transform the index of relative abundance into a density estimate. The PIF proportionality ratio refl ects a speciesspecifi c probability of detection based in part on distance between a bird and the observer. The eff ect of a detection-distance adjustment factor is to reduce or increase the eff ective area to which the index is applied. Because the BBS collects relative rather than absolute abundance data, a crucial assumption in this approach is that this index is directly proportional to population size. The panel did not evaluate specifi c detection distances for individual species but suggested that this adjustment may be the most important and, coincidentally, the most uncertain of the adjustment factors. For instance, a 200-m detection distance, in eff ect, quadruples the population estimate, compared with a detection distance of 400 m. For species whose detection distance was 800 m (i.e., vultures and some hawks: 1.8% of species), the reverse occurs, and their estimates were reduced to onequarter by this adjustment factor. For 62% of the species (n = 243 species), their population size estimate was increased by 4\u00d7 over the index; 20.4% (n = 80) had their estimate increased 10.24\u00d7, and 4.8% (n = 19) of the species had their estimate increased 25\u00d7. Estimates for 11% (n = 43) of the species incurred no change from the species-specifi c detection-distance adjustments.\nSeveral elements can potentially infl uence the validity of the detection-distance adjustment. The literature on factors infl uencing detection distances is extensive (e.g., Buckland et al. 2001) . Eff ective detection distances undoubtedly vary not only by species but also by habitat, time of day, time of year, calling rate, song volume, and observer (O'Connor et al. 2000 , Thompson 2002 ). For the PIF estimates, a single estimate of detection distance for each species was posited; no a\u0134 empt was made to accommodate variation associated with these variables. The BBS protocol a\u0134 empts to standardize conditions under which counts are made. Despite this constancy imposed by protocols, detection distances are not likely to be constant (Nichols et al. 2000 , Rosenstock et al. 2002 , Norvell et al. 2003 . Variation in detection distance may lead to over-or underestimating population sizes (Buckland et al. 2001) . Unfortunately, few empirical data exist for appropriate estimation of detection distances from BBS data. It would be useful to directly incorporate the uncertainty associated with these distances into the precision of the population estimates.\nThe third adjustment factor, a time-of-day adjustment, was used to accommodate time-ofday variation in detectability when the route is surveyed. This adjustment factor was estimated for each species by polynomial fi ts to tallies of stop counts, where the fi rst stop represents the earliest count and the 50th stop represents the latest count. Fi\u0134 ing a polynomial to these stopspecifi c counts smooths the pa\u0134 ern in counts. One concern, however, in using polynomials is that they may be particularly ill-fi \u0134 ed at their [Auk, Vol. 123 extremes because of a paucity of data to anchor the ends of the fi \u0134 ed line. Thus, fi ts for species whose peaks in abundance occur early (e.g., nocturnal birds) or late may not be properly measured. Maxima drawn from these potentially poorly fi \u0134 ed polynomials may therefore be inadequately assessed (Fig. 1) . This, in turn, would infl uence the maximum count:mean count ratio. Some species (n = 14, strigiform and caprimulgiform species) are especially infl uenced by this time-of-day adjustment factor, having their estimate of abundance infl ated by between 3.0\u00d7 and 22.3\u00d7 (Table 4) . As with other sources of variation in detection, it would F\u0456\u0454. 1. On the assumption that stop number is a surrogate for time of day, sixth-order polynomials were drawn to mean stop-specific counts across all routes to identify a purported maximum. In the extreme case for Whip-poor-will, the observed maximum count was 285, whereas the predicted maximum from the polynomial fit (at stop 1) was 245. The predicted maximum for Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) was 1,006. Figures were redrawn from P. J. Blancher and K. V. Rosenberg (unpubl. data). be useful to directly incorporate uncertainty in estimation of the rates in the population estimate.\nOther considerations.-Means for the counts in the 1990s may be based on results from 1 to 10 years. Means derived from only a few years are intrinsically less precise than means based on more years. They may not be representative of the mean conditions within the decade because they may be aff ected, for instance, by droughts or extremely wet conditions. An additional concern is that baseline observer competence may be changing over time (Link and Sauer 1998), a factor that can be accommodated in more sophisticated analyses (Link and Sauer 2002) .\nThere is also concern regarding the methodology used to extrapolate counts from prior decades for insuffi ciently sampled areas in boreal Canada. Habitat bias may be important in the boreal zone, given that most BBS routes are located in the southern portion of this large zone."}, {"section_title": "W\u0455\u044e\u0461 A\u0450\u0461\u0456\u045c\u045b\u0460 C\u044e\u045b B\u0452 T\u044e\u0458\u0452\u045b \u0461\u045c I\u045a\u045d\u045f\u045c\u0463\u0452 \u0461\u0455\u0452 D\u044e\u0461\u044e \u045c\u045f A\u045b\u044e\u0459\u0466\u0460\u0452\u0460 \u045c\u045b W\u0455\u0456\u0450\u0455 \u0461\u0455\u0452 PIF P\u045c\u045d\u0462\u0459\u044e\u0461\u0456\u045c\u045b E\u0460\u0461\u0456\u045a\u044e\u0461\u0452\u0460 W\u0452\u045f\u0452 B\u044e\u0460\u0452\u0451?", "text": "Recommendations for the short term.-First, because it is unclear how robust the estimates are to the many assumptions implicit in the procedure, we suggest that a simulation exercise be used to document consequences of variation in the assumptions. A sensitivity analysis would identify those parameters of the model (i.e., index values and adjustment factors) that are most infl uential with respect to error or variability in the assumed input. The adjustment factor for detection distance has the potential for exerting the greatest eff ect on population size estimates. All estimates should be accompanied by estimates of precision. Sensitivity analysis could identify credible bounds for the population estimates, which to date are expressed only qualitatively.\nThe Rosenberg and Blancher approach is based on adjustments of mean counts. Alternatively, more sophisticated model-based approaches explicitly incorporating known sources of variability could be used to be\u0134 er incorporate uncertainty in the estimates. For instance, hierarchical modeling approaches allow for direct estimation of route-specifi c abundances that are adjusted for observer and population-change eff ects (e.g., Link and Sauer 2002), spatial eff ects (Thogmartin et al. 2004) , and the detectability adjustments used in the Rosenberg and Blancher (2005) population estimates. For instance, for geopolitical regions not sampled by BBS routes, the model-based solution incorporating spatial correlation in counts may be a useful means of estimating expected counts for areas in which they are unknown.\nThe present scheme for population estimation from BBS data is limited by uncertainty in the magnitude and precision of the adjustments for detection. Without empirical data on detection rates, estimates will always be subject to criticism. Thus, the panel encourages experimental studies to develop approaches for estimating detectability in the BBS. Until such estimates become available, the panel recommends that ongoing eff orts to refi ne the estimates be initiated, including a comprehensive survey of literature and of current research to identify available information about speciesspecifi c detection distances and the eff ects on detectability of habitat, sex, time of day, time of year, observer, and other factors. Of particular concern is the identifi cation of specifi c gaps in our knowledge regarding species-and covariate-specifi c detection-distance categories. The number of species for which detection distances are available is small but growing. Detection distances acquired from the literature, even if they do not account for bias because of roadsides, may be be\u0134 er than the current fi velevel detection distances. Collecting data on detection is the best way to improve our understanding of species-, space-, and time-specifi c variation in rates. As noted below, systematic collection of these data in the BBS and other surveys is a long-term strategy for enhancing the quality of the population size estimates.\nThe validity of the pair adjustment used in the population estimation approach undoubtedly varies among species, refl ecting diff erences in mating strategy, behavior, and habitat. The panel recommends evaluation and study of the pair adjustment factor. Given the paucity of current data, studies based on surveys of marked populations may be the only way to obtain reliable estimates of pair adjustments.\nUse of polynomial regression for identifying maximum counts for the time-of-day adjustment should be evaluated against alternative means, such as simple observed maximum, an [Auk, Vol. 123 average of the top several counts, loess smoothing (Cleveland and Devlin 1988), or more sophisticated approaches such as maximumlikelihood estimation of the maxima.\nAdditional features that could infl uence counts should be considered in the analysis. In particular, several authors have suggested that interactions between calling rates and population density can invalidate indices to abundance (e.g., McShea and Rappole 1997, Penteriani 2003) . Additional review of literature for cue production studies would be worthwhile. These cue production studies may be particularly relevant to understanding how well polynomial regression predicts peak calling in nocturnal or crepuscular birds.\nBecause the pair adjustment may not overcome errors in the time-of-day or time-of-year adjustment, we recommend disentangling the pair adjustment from adjustment factors that may be imposed for those species that are nocturnal or crespuscular, early or late breeders, or have an unknown fl oater population. One obvious adjustment would be to evaluate BBS counts with regard to how they vary seasonally, so as to calibrate the estimates for early-or late-season breeders. Modeling of rangewide progressions of peak song periods and studies of how detectability changes as a function of peak song period would prove informative to these calibrations.\nEstimates of population sizes for each of the three terrestrial ecozones in Arctic Canada should be interpreted with caution. Although the methodology used by PIF for estimating population size of landbirds in the Arctic makes use of most of the data that are available for the region, we suggest that the estimates based on those data are particularly prone to bias, because BBC and Checklist sites are not selected randomly and tend to be in areas of high bird densities. The assumption that Checklist-BBC estimates are comparable to BBS estimates likely does not hold. Also, we suggest that the total amount of land useable by birds should be used as the area for which estimates of populations are made, given that large areas in the high Arctic are covered by unsuitable glaciers or are otherwise devoid of vegetation.\nRecommendations for the long term.-Much of the uncertainty associated with the approach outlined by Rosenberg and Blancher (2005) is a result of using the data for a purpose for which they were not intended. The BBS was not originally envisioned to provide continental estimates of population sizes but rather to monitor trends in populations. To fully address these uncertainties, it will be necessary to update the population estimates as new information regarding detection rates and other factors becomes available from experimental studies. Also, concerns about the representativeness of roadside habitats and of data from outside the BBS survey area can be addressed only with additional survey information and continued modeling.\nInformation on detection of birds along routes.-Statistical procedures such as distance sampling (Buckland et al. 2001) , double observer methods (Nichols et al. 2000) , and replicate counting methods (Royle and Nichols 2003) permit direct estimation of detection rates from point counts. Direct application of these approaches to the BBS and other surveys would provide data on time-of-day eff ects, habitat specifi city, and eff ective detection distances, and would allow direct estimation of many of the parameters that are presently unknown or poorly estimated in the Rosenberg and Blancher modeling exercise. The panel suggests that fi eld investigators be encouraged to routinely collect this information. Experimental studies of such approaches along BBS routes would be useful. Additional studies focusing on groups of species of particular interest that have large temporal correction factors, such as strigiforms and caprimulgiforms, are needed.\nDevelopment of surveys in northern regions.-Population estimates are most questionable when they are based on extremely limited samples or on detection-nondetection data sources, such as checklists. Given the paucity of data for birds in Arctic Canada and concern that global climate change may be most pronounced at northern latitudes (McCarthy et al. 2001) , development of surveys that provide information on bird populations would be useful in documenting both present values and future changes in this important region.\nBe\u0134 er integration of survey and habitat data.-Development of statistical models is an essential component of future development of population estimates. Population estimates will be most useful for conservation planning if they are directly related to habitat acquisition and other management goals. Many studies are using BBS data to develop models associating bird populations with habitat and other environmental features (e.g., Thogmartin et al. 2004) , and more use of these models in bird conservation planning may help resolve several of the issues associated with population estimation. For example, nonrepresentativeness of roadside habitats can be addressed either by collection of data in nonroadside habitats or by modeling bird habitat associations using existing data and using the models to predict abundances in off -road habitats. Models can then be used to guide future data-collection eff orts, and the additional data (for example, counts made away from roadsides) can be used to improve models. These modeling eff orts require appropriate geographic information on habitats, other environmental features that infl uence bird populations, and BBS data.\nModels can allow for controlling of population change in the estimation of abundance. One obvious limitation of species-specifi c population estimates as they are currently made is that populations are assumed to be static. Sauer et al. (2004) , however, indicated that 38% of the Neotropical migrant species surveyed in the BBS during 1980-2003 declined and 18% increased. Because bird populations are not static and, in fact, many are in decline, the panel recommends devising a population estimation scheme that incorporates temporal trends in abundance. Various hierarchical modeling approaches are promising for their ability to estimate population trends (Link and Sauer 2002) .\nModels also permit a common currency for translating population sizes across spatial scales and for comparing species. The most obvious currency is habitat-specifi c estimates of density for each species. In the long term, habitat-based models estimating population size for each state-province-territory \u00d7 Bird Conservation Region unit would be valuable. These habitatbased models may be able to identify limiting factors and could be used to set habitat-specifi c numerical population objectives. Further, incorporating habitat-based models with estimates of trend may allow future projections of population size in response to proposed management of habitat.\nExtrapolation beyond the United States and Canada.-The fourth assumption of the population estimation approach is that densities of birds are similar in North America and beyond.\nThis assumption deserves considerable scrutiny, because diff erences in density for species existing primarily outside the United States and Canada may cause huge errors in the estimated global population size for a species. Much greater investigation into densities of North American species whose ranges overlap boreal Russia and Latin America is needed. The panel suggests that extrapolation to areas outside North America is particularly dangerous and not clearly relevant to PIF goals.\nH\u045c\u0464 S\u0455\u045c\u0462\u0459\u0451 \u0461\u0455\u0452 PIF P\u045c\u045d\u0462\u0459\u044e\u0461\u0456\u045c\u045b E\u0460\u0461\u0456\u045a\u044e\u0461\u0452\u0460 \u044f\u0452 I\u045b\u0461\u0452\u045f\u045d\u045f\u0452\u0461\u0452\u0451?\nIn Rich et al. (2004) , current bird populations are estimated using the procedures critiqued in this paper, but goals are o\u011e en framed in terms of estimation of population trends. At the scale of bird conservation regions, management options are usually defi ned in terms of acquisition and restoration of habitats, and predicted increases in populations are based on models predicting numbers of birds as a function of added habitat. However, these numbers are not directly comparable to either the estimated trends or the habitat goals defi ned by bird conservation initiatives. We view this lack of a connection of population estimates, trend, and habitat goals as a fl aw in the system. As noted above, opportunities exist to develop models that directly associate management options, trend estimates, and population estimates, and we suggest that these approaches be considered for future analyses.\nUncertainty in population estimates makes comparisons between species, especially for the purposes of prioritization, problematic. Further, this uncertainty in population size adds to uncertainties associated with determining whether species have reached a particular conservation target as outlined in the North American Landbird Conservation Plan. Documenting the extent of variation associated with the population estimates will enhance the value of the estimates, and most of our recommendations refl ect our concern that interpretation of the present quantities is complicated by the present lack of variance estimates. Interpretation of the estimates must also be sensitive to temporal variation in bird numbers. Bird populations are dynamic, and successive estimates must refl ect the temporal components of population change. [Auk, Vol. 123 In summary, the panel applauds P. J. Blancher and K. V. Rosenberg for their progress with the diffi cult task of estimating the population sizes of North American landbirds. As they noted, signifi cant uncertainties still exist with the estimates, and interpretations of the estimates should involve a careful consideration of their limitations. The panel recommends a program of evaluation of the present uncertainties, combined with experimental and theoretical work, to be\u0134 er integrate population estimates with bird conservation and management."}]
