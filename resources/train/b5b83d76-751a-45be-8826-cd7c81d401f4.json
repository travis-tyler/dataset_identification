[{"section_title": "20", "text": "The first case of the novel coronavirus was reported on December 30, 2019, in Wuhan city, 21\nHubei province, P.R. China [1] . Swift actions were taken by the Centre for Disease Control and 22\nPrevention (CDC), Chinese health authorities, and researchers. The World Health Organization 23 (WHO) temporarily named this pathogen 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [2] . On January 24 10, 2020, the first whole-genome sequence of 2019-nCoV was released, which helped 25 researchers to quickly identify the virus in patients using reverse-transcription polymerase chain 26 reaction (RT-PCR) methods [3] . On January 21, the first article related to 2019-nCoV was 27 published, which revealed that 2019-nCoV belongs to the beta-coronavirus group, sharing 28 ancestry with bat coronavirus HKU9-1, similar to SARS-coronaviruses, and despite sequence 29 diversity its spike protein interacts strongly with the human ACE2 receptor [1] . On January 30, Coronaviruses are single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses that possess large viral RNA 42 genomes [5] . Recent studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 has a similar genomic organization to 43 other beta-coronaviruses, consisting of a 5'-untranslated region (UTR), a replicase complex 44 (orf1ab) encoding non-structural proteins (nsps), a spike protein (S) gene, envelope protein (E) 45 gene, a membrane protein (M) gene, a nucleocapsid protein (N) gene, 3'-UTR, and several 46 unidentified non-structural open reading frames [3] . Although SARS-CoV-2 is classified into the 47 beta-coronaviruses group, it is diverse from MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Recent studies 48 highlighted that SARS-CoV-2 genes share <80% nucleotide identity and 89.10% nucleotide 49 similarity with SARS-CoV genes [6, 7] . Usually, beta-coronaviruses produce a ~800 kDa 50 polypeptide upon transcription of the genome. This polypeptide is proteolytically cleaved to 51 generate various proteins. The proteolytic processing is mediated by papain-like protease (PL pro ) 52 and 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro ). The 3CL pro cleaves the polyprotein at 11 distinct sites 53 to generate various non-structural proteins that are important for viral replication [8]. 3CL pro play 54 a critical role in the replication of virus particles and unlike structural/accessory protein-encoding 55 genes, it is located at the 3' end which exhibits excessive variability. Therefore, it is a potential 56 target for anti-coronaviruses inhibitors screening [9]. Structure-based activity analyses and high-57 throughput studies have identified potential inhibitors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 3CL pro 58\n[10-12]. Medicinal plants, especially those employed in traditional Chinese medicine, have 59 attracted significant attention because they include bioactive compounds that could be used to 60 develop formal drugs against several diseases with no or minimal side-effects [13] . Therefore, 61 the present study was conducted to obtain structural insight into the SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro and to 62 discover potent anti-COVID-19 natural compounds. Whole-genome sequences of all available SARS-CoV-2 isolates available till January 31, 2020, 67\nwere downloaded from GISAID database (accession numbers and details are given in Table S1 ) 68 "}, {"section_title": "Sequence analyses 76", "text": "In order to identify similar sequences and key/conserved residues, and to infer phylogeny, 77 multiple sequence alignment of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro followed by phylogenetic tree analyses 78 were performed using T-Coffee [15] and the alignment figure was generated using ESPript3 79 "}, {"section_title": "Structural analyses 83", "text": "To probe the molecular architecture of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro , comparative homology modelling 84 was performed using Modeller v9.11 [17] . To select closely-related templates for modelling, 85 PSI-BLAST was performed against all known structures in the protein databank (PDB) [18] . 86 Chimera v1.8. 1 [19] and PyMOL educational version [20] were used for initial quality 87 estimation, energy minimisation, mutation analyses, and image processing. "}, {"section_title": "Sequence and structural analyses 108", "text": "Multiple sequence alignment results revealed that 3CL pro was conserved, with 100% identity 109 among all SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Next, the SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro protein sequence was 110 compared with its closest homologs (Bat-CoV, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Human-CoV and 111\nBovine-CoV). The results revealed that SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro clustered with bat SARS-like 112 coronaviruses and sharing 99.02% sequence identity (Fig. 1A) . Furthermore, it shares 96.08%, 113 87.00%, 90.00% and 90.00% sequence identity with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Human-CoV and 114\nBovine-CoV homologs, respectively (Fig. 1B) . These finding were consistent with an initial 115 study reporting that SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV, and shares a 116 common ancestor with bat coronaviruses [1, 3, 31] . Analysis of physicochemical parameters 117 revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro polypeptide is 306 amino acids long with a molecular 118 weight of 33,796.64 Da and a GRAVY score of -0.019, categorising the protein as a stable, 119 hydrophilic molecule capable of establishing hydrogen bonds (Table 1) . 120 considerably lower (Fig. S3) . These results indicated that the 12-point mutations identified at 161 previous step may disrupt important hydrogen bonds and alter the receptor binding site, thereby 162 affecting its ability to bind with the SARS-CoV inhibitor. 163 Therefore, it was essential to discover novel compounds that may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro 164 and serve as potential anti-COVID-19 drug compounds. We developed a library from our 165 previously published studies that contains numerous natural compounds possessing potential 166\nanti-viral activities and screened it against the SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro homology model. Recent 167 drug repurposing studies proposed few drugs that target SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro and suggested that 168 they could be used to treat COVID-19. Herein, we selected the best of these (Nelfinavir, 169\nPrulifloxacin and Colistin) from three different drug repurposing studies [36, 37] and docked 170 them as controls in the present study (Fig. S4 ). Our analyses identified nine novel non-toxic, 171 druggable natural compounds that are predicted to bind with the receptor binding site and 172 catalytic dyad (Cys-145 and His-41) of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro ( Table 2 ; Fig. S5 ).

Despite significant overall similarity with the 211 SARS-CoV 3CL pro structure, the SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro substrate binding site had some key 212 differences, which highlighted the need for rapid drug discovery to address the alarming 213 Postdoctoral research platform grant of Guangxi University.
