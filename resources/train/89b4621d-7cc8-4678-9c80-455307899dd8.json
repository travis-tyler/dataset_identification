[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In December 2019, clusters of pneumonia cases caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) were identified at the Wuhan, Hubei province in China [21, 25] after almost hundred years of the 1918 Spanish flu [59] . Soon after the emergence of the novel beta coronavirus, World Health Organization (WHO) characterized this contagious disease as a pandemic in March due to its rapid spread within and outside the highly mobile population of China supported by densely populated location of sea-food market and time of advent [51] with an exponential increase in the incidence rate (IR) and case-fatality rate (CFR) [41] . As of September 29, 2020, a total of 33,732,181 confirmed cases and 1,009,512 deaths have been reported worldwide [5] .\nResearchers are facing unprecedented challenges during this global pandemic to forecast future real-time cases with traditional mathematical, statistical and machine learning-based forecasting tools [17, 31, 33, 61, 65] . Studies in March with simple yet powerful forecasting methods like exponential smoothing model predicted cases ten days ahead, with large confidence intervals, that despite the positive bias, had reasonable forecast error [46] . Previously used linear and exponential model forecasts for better preparation regarding hospital beds, ICU admission estimation, resource allocation, emergency funding,and proposing strong containment measures were conducted [19] that projected about 869 ICU and 14542 ICU admissions in Italy for March 20, 2020. ICU admissions and mechanical ventilation use for critically ill patients reached its peak shattering the health system of Lombardy, Italy, by March-end [20] . Health-care workers had to go through the immense mental stress left with a formidable choice of prioritizing young and healthy adults over elderly for allocation of life support, especially unwanted ignoring of those who are extremely unlikely to survive [16, 52] . Real estimates of mortality with 14-day delay demonstrated underestimating the COVID-19 outbreak and indicated a grave future with a global CFR of 5.7% in March [4] . The contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation efforts have a differential effect on the mortality due to COVID-19 among countries. Even though it seems that the CFR of COVID-19 is less compared to SARS (10%) and MERS (36%), there are concerns about it being eventually returning as the seasonal flu, causing a second wave or future pandemic [45, 48] . Thus, real-time nowcasting and forecasting with foretelling predictions are required to reach a statistically validated conjecture in this current health crisis. Some of the impacting leading-edge research concerning real-time projections of COVID-19 confirmed cases, recovered cases, and mortality using statistical, epidemiological and machine learning models are given in Table 1 . However, forecasting COVID-19 pandemics is harder and this is primarily due to the following major factors [29] :\n\u2022 Very less amount of data is available; \u2022 Less understanding of the factors that contribute to it; \u2022 Model accuracy is constrained by our knowledge of the virus. With an emerging disease such as COVID-19, many biologic features of transmission are hard to measure and remain unknown. \u2022 Another source of uncertainty, affecting all models, is that we don't know how many people are, or have been, infected. \u2022 We are certainly missing a substantial number of cases due to virologic testing, so models fitted to confirmed cases are likely to be highly uncertain [23] . Time series forecasting models work by taking a series of historical observations and extrapolating the patterns into the future. These are great when the data are accurate, the future is similar to the past. There are essentially two general approaches to forecasting a time series: (a) generating forecasts from a single model; and (b) combining forecasts from many models (Hybrid experts). In classical time series forecasting, the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is used predominantly for forecasting linear time series [6] , which has a significant strong assumption of linearity in the system and homoscedastic error distribution; typically without sudden jumps and bursts. Individual models such as ARIMA, Wavelet ARIMA (WBF) [14] , generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) [15] and Theta method [2, 28] are inadequate to model such situations. Usage of non-linear time series techniques in infectious disease modeling have successfully demonstrated the success of artificial neural networks (ANN) and autoregressive neural networks (ARNN) [8, 34, 38, 63] . There are also a vast literature available on the hybrid models motivated by the seminal work of Bates & Granger [3] and followed by a plethora of empirical applications showing that combination forecasts are often superior to their individual counterparts. The idea of hybridizing time series models are by no means new -see for example [3, 9, 11, 13, 30, 63] . Most recently, some promising hybrid models combining linear and nonlinear time series models are proposed for COVID-19 [10, 11] and dengue [9] forecasting and performed well for predicting these epidemics.\nMotivated by this, this study considers the time series data sets of coronavirus confirmed cases which show non-linearity, non-stationary and non-Gaussian patterns, making decisions based on a discrete model critical and unreliable. Another difficulty in COVID-19 data from the modeling aspect is the unavailability of sufficient data points, which generates biased predictions and estimates, which can be well maneuvered by neural nets [42] . Most of the relevant studies focused on the outbreak's short-term and long-term forecasts of reported confirmed cases have a broad range of fluctuations, wide confidence intervals, poorly reported data/model specifics, and predictive performance being too optimistic the models are becoming unreliable [62] . Hybridization of two or more models is the most common solution [40] for optimizing forecasting performance, and efficacious with unknown complete data characteristics [32] . The importance of hybrid methodology with a fusion of linear and non-linear forecasting models, becomes evident in tackling such dynamic/non-linear time series and its inbuilt time-changing variance, complex autocorrelation structure [11, 44] . With growing expectations of advanced parsimonious hybrid forecasting methods accompanied by precise accuracy and more accurate forecasts, the main objectives of this study are:\n\u2022 To propose a simple and computationally efficient hybrid forecasting model which generates short-term and long-term out-of-sample forecasts for eight profoundly affected countries (United States of America (USA), India, Brazil, Russia, South Africa, Mexico, Spain, and Iran). \u2022 To compare the suggested method with traditional discrete and hybrid forecasting models with finer accuracy. \u2022 To prove the model's stationarity and ergodicity properties from statistician's point of view. \u2022 To recommend policy-making decisions, resource allocation based on these forecasts. \u2022 To discuss the merits and future challenges that has to be addressed while working with the proposal for epidemiological forecasting.\nTherefore, this study proposes a novel hybrid Theta autoregressive neural network model (TARNN) model combining Theta and ARNN models that can capture complex COVID-19 data structures. The linearity is controlled by the Theta method in the initial phase, while the non-linear trend of the COVID-19 data sets is adjusted by the ARNN model using residual values obtained from the base Theta model. The proposed model has easy interpretability, robust predictability and can adapt seasonality indices. Desirable statistical properties like asymptotic stationarity and ergodicity of the proposed TARNN model are explored. Through experimental evaluation, we have shown the excellent performance of the proposed hybrid model for the COVID-19 pandemics forecasting for eight different countries' data sets.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the detailed formulation of the proposed hybrid TARNN model. The ergodicity and stationarity of the proposed hybrid model are discussed in Section 3. In Section 4, we discuss the countrywise COVID-19 confirmed case data sets, preliminary of data analysis, performance evaluation metrics, and the experimental results. The discussions about the results and practical implications are given in Section 5. Finally, we conclude the paper with a direction for future research in Section 6."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "This study proposes a novel hybrid model based on Theta and ARNN models to forecast the confirmed cases of COVID-19 for eight profoundly affected countries.

The method decomposes the original data into two or more lines, called theta lines, and extrapolates them using forecasting models. Finally, the predictions are combined to obtain the final forecasts. The theta lines can be estimated by simply modifying the 'curvatures' of the original time series. This change is obtained from a coefficient, called \u03b8 coefficient, which is directly applied to the second differences of the time series:\nwhere Y \" data = Y t \u22122Y t\u22121 +Y t\u22122 at time t for t = 3, 4, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n and {Y 1 , Y 2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Y n } denote the observed univariate time series. In practice, coefficient \u03b8 can be considered as a transformation parameter which creates a series of the same mean and slope with that of the original data but having different variances. Now, Eqn. (1) is a second-order difference equation and has solution of the following form [28] :\nwhere a \u03b8 and b \u03b8 are constants and t = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n. Thus, Y new (\u03b8) is equivalent to a linear function of Y t with a linear trend added. The values of a \u03b8 and b \u03b8 are computed 5 All rights reserved.

Also, the prediction intervals and likelihood-based estimation of the parameters can be obtained based on a state space model which is demonstrated in [28] . The generalized version of the Theta method is suitable for for automatic forecasting of time series [55] ."}, {"section_title": "ARNN Model", "text": "Artificial Neural Network-based forecasting methods received increasing interest in various applied domains in late 1990s. A wide variety of neural nets are popularly used for supervised classification, prediction and nonlinear time series forecasting [64] . The architecture of a simple feedforward neural network can be described as a network of neurons arranged in input layer, hidden layer, and output layer in a prescribed order. Each layer passes the information to the next layer using weights that are obtained using a learning algorithm [18] . ARNN model is a modification to the simple ANN model especially designed for prediction problems of time series data sets [18] . ARNN model uses a pre-specified number of lagged values of the time series as inputs and number of hidden neurons in its architecture is also fixed [26] . ARNN(p, k) model uses p lagged inputs of the time series data in a one hidden layered feedforward neural network with k hidden units in the hidden layer. Let x denotes a p-lagged inputs and f is a neural network of the following architecture:\nwhere c 0 , a j , w j are connecting weights, b j are p-dimensional weight vector and \u03c6 is a bounded nonlinear sigmoidal function (e.g., logistic squasher function or tangent hyperbolic activation function). These Weights are trained using a gradient descent backpropagation [53] . Standard ANN faces the dilemma to choose the number of hidden neurons in the hidden layer and optimal choice is unknown. But for ARNN model, we adopt the formula k = [(p + 1)/2] for non-seasonal time series data where p is the number of lagged inputs in an autoregressive model [26] ."}, {"section_title": "Proposed TARNN Model", "text": "In this section, we describe the propose hybrid model based on Theta method and ARNN model and we name it TARNN model.

Now, even if the relationship is of product type, in the log-log scale it becomes additive. Hence, without loss of generality, we may assume the relationship to be additive and expect errors (additive) of a forecasting model to be random shocks. But, this is violated when there are complex correlation structures in the time series data and less amount of knowledge is available about the data generating process. A simple example is the daily confirmed cases of the COVID-19 cases for various countries where very little is known about the structural properties of the current pandemic. Thus, we need two-stage modeling approach to formulate this complex time series problem. The proposed TARNN model is a hybrid model based on additive error re-modeling approach. The hybrid TARNN approach consists of three basic steps:\n\u2022 In first step of the TARNN model, the Theta method is applied to the time series data to model the linear components of given time series data set. \u2022 Theta model generates in-sample forecasts and the error series is calculated.\n\u2022 In the next phase, the residuals (additive errors) generated by the Theta method are re-modeled using a nonlinear ARNN model. Finally, both the forecasts obtained from the Theta and ARNN models are combined together to get the final forecasts for the given time series.\nThe mathematical formulation of the proposed hybrid TARNN model (Z t ) is as follows:\nwhere L t is the linear part and N t is the nonlinear part of the hybrid model. We can estimate both L t and N t from the available time series data. LetL t be the forecast value of the Theta model at time t and t represent the error residuals at time t, obtained from the Theta model. Then, we write\nThese left-out residuals are further modeled by ARNN model and can be represented as follows:\nwhere f is a nonlinear function and the modeling is done by the ARNN model as defined in Eqn.

Thus, the proposed TARNN model can be considered as an error re-modeling approach. This is important because due to model mis-specification and disturbances in the pandemic rate time series, the linear Theta model may fail to generate white noise behavior for the forecast residuals.

The ergodicity and stationarity is of particular importance from a statistician's point of view in time series analysis since for such processes a single realization displays the whole probability of the data generating process. We use several previous results on nonlinear time series and Markov chains to find sufficient conditions for which the overall process is ergodic and stationary [7, 12, 58] . To start, we write the underlying stochastic model of the Theta method using the state space approach. We initialize the model by setting Y 1 = l 1 and then for t = 2, 3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ; and drift term b, let\nwhere { t } is assumed to follow Gaussian white noise with mean zero and variance \u03c3 2 and \u03b1 is the smoothing parameter for the simple exponential smoothing (SES) model.

Also, Y t can be written in the following form:\nThe above is an ARIMA(0,1,1) process with drift term [28] . The left-out residuals of Theta model is further modeled by ARNN process. We consider the ARNN process generated by the additive noise of the ARIMA(0,1,1) process with drift.

Then, we say {z t } is asymptotically stationary [36] . To establish the ergodicity of TARNN processes, we need the concept of irreducibility and aperiodicity. Hence, it is possible that the Markov chain returns to given sets only at specific time points for an aperiodic Markov chain. For most general time series models, irreducibility and aperiodicity cannot be assumed automatically. But for a TARNN process, these conditions can be checked. In general, it is sufficient to assume the distribution of the noise process to be an absolutely continuous component with respect to Lebesgue measure and the support of the probability density function (PDF) is sufficiently large."}, {"section_title": "Main Results", "text": "It is clear from the above discussion that if the Markov chain is geometrically ergodic then its distribution will converge to \u03c0 and the corresponding time series will be called asymptotically stationary, see also [58] . Lemma 3.1 states that the state space of the Markov chain cannot be reduced depending on the starting point. Proof. Since the support of the PDF of \u03b5 t is the whole real line, that is, the PDF is positive everywhere in R, then we can say that {z t } is \u03d5-irreducible by using [12] . In our case, every non-null p-dimensional hypercube can be reached in p steps with positive probability (and hence every non-null Borel set A). A necessary and sufficient condition for {z t } to be aperiodic is to have a set A and positive integer n such that P n (z, A) > 0 and P n+1 (z, A) > 0 for all z \u2208 A [58] . In this case, this is true for all n due to consideration of the unbounded additive noise.\nThe theorem below states the necessary condition for geometric ergodicity of a Markov chain. This can be obtained using the decomposition technique and ergodicity of stochastic difference equations [12] .\nTheorem 3.2. Suppose {z t } is defined as in (6) and (7), F be a compact set that can be decomposed as F = F h + F d , and the following conditions hold: (i) F h (.) is continuous and homogeneous and F d (.) is bounded; (ii) E|\u03b5 t | < \u221e and probability distribution function of \u03b5 t is positive everywhere in R; then {z t } is geometrically ergodic.\nProof. {z t } satisfies the following equation:\nLet F h be continuous and homogeneous, viz., F h (cz) = cF h (z) for all c > 0, z t \u2208 R p , and F d is bounded. Let the origin, O, be a fixed point of F h . It is important to note that \u03b5 t satisfies the condition (ii) in Theorem 3.2. We are going to show that the existence of a continuous Lyapunov function, V , in a neighbourhood of the origin which will ensure the geometric ergodicity of (7).\nTo start with we let W \u2286 R p , the closure of W by W and its boundary by W . We also let V be defined over the closure of the unit ball. We let p 0 = inf z =1 V (z), where \u00b7 denote the Euclidean norm. Also, let G be the maximal connected component of {z : V (z) < p0 2 } that contains the origin. Then we have F (G) \u2282 G. Let g(z) = inf{r \u2265 0, z \u2208 rG}, z \u2208 R p , where rG = {rz, z \u2208 G}. Then g(z) is well defined and it can easily be checked that g has the following properties:\n(1) g(cz) = cg(z), for all c > 0.\n(2) There exists 0 < c < C < \u221e such that c z \u2264 g(z) \u2264 C z .\n(3) z/g(z) \u2208 G.

(7), \u03b5 t satisfies E|\u03b5 t | < \u221e. Let A \u2208 B and z \u2208 R p , we define P (z, A) be the transition probability function as:\nThus, it holds that g(y)P (z, dy)\nHere |\u03b2(z)| < B < \u221e for all z and \u03b2(z) \u2192 0 as z \u2192 \u221e.

Using Theorem 4 of [60] , we can conclude that {z t } is geometric ergodic.\nThe next theorem gives the main result for asymptotic stationary of the TARNN model. (6) and (7), respectively. Then if f is a nonlinear neural network as defined in (4), then {z t } is geometrically ergodic and {\u03b5 t } is asymptotically stationary.\nProof. The noise process \u03b5 t satisfies E|\u03b5 t | < \u221e by assumption (e.g., Gaussian noise). It is also important to note that neural network activation functions, more precisely logistics or tan-hyperbolic activation functions, are continuous compact functions and have bounded range. Thus {z t } satisfies all the criteria to be geometrically ergodic and using Theorem (3.2), one can write that for the ARNN process with F h \u2261 0 and F d \u2261 F .

Further, model residuals of these eight countries were trained using ARNN (12, 6) ARNN (20, 10) , ARNN (9, 5) , ARNN (7, 4) , ARNN (7, 4) , ARNN (14, 8) , ARNN (11, 6) and ARNN(3,2) models with an average of 20 networks for all eight datasets, each of which is a 12-6-1, 20-10-1, 9-5-1, 7-4-1, 7-4-1, 14-8-1, 11-6-1 and 3-2-1 networks with 85, 221, 56, 37, 37, 129, 79 and 11 weights and with 492095, 33990, 40429, 196628, 59296, 646.9, 18603 and 102346 estimated \u03c3 2 , respectively. Finally, the predicted results of both Theta and ARNN models are added together to obtain the estimated forecasts of the proposed TARNN model. In a similar way, we applied hybrid WBF-ARIMA model, hybrid WBF-GARCH model, hybrid ARIMA-ARNN models over eight COVID-19 confirmed case datasets for comparison purposes.\nRoot mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) were utilized to evaluate the predictive performance of the models [11] . Availability of data points is limited, thus implementation of the advanced deep learning techniques will result in over-fitting and biased estimates [22] . Actual vs. predicted values of well-performed model are plotted in Figure 5 . As the Theta model is fitted on the residual time series, predictions are generated for the next ten (July 31 2020 to August 09 2020) and fifty (July 31 2020 to September 18 2020) time steps respectively. The real-time short-term forecasts using ARIMA, Theta, ARNN and hybrid ARIMA-ARNN and the proposed TARNN model are shown in Table 6 and the real-time long-term forecasts are illustrated in Table 7 .\nWe compared our proposed TARNN model with traditional single models (ARIMA, GARCH, Theta, ARNN) along with hybrid WBF-ARIMA model, hybrid WBF-GARCH model and the experimental results are reported in Table 3 . The performance of the proposed hybrid Theta-ARNN (TARNN) model is superior as compared to all the traditional individual and hybrid models on average. In comparison to other hybrid models, six out of eight data sets of COVID-19 confirmed cases, our proposed TARNN model outperformed all the hybrid and traditional individual models in the significant edge. The theoretically proven asymptotic stationarity of the proposed hybrid model also suggests that the model cannot have a growing variance over time. The consistency and adequacy in experimental results empirically approves the same. Thus, the efficacy of the proposed methodology of the proposed hybrid model is experimentally validated.\nAll the results can be effortlessly updated with the help of R-shiny application as new data becomes available.

Real-time out of sample forecasts (50 days ahead) of COVID-19 confirmed cases for different forecasting models for USA, Brazil, India, Russia, South Africa, Mexico, Spain and Iran "}, {"section_title": "Discussions", "text": "In this study, we proposed a novel hybrid Theta-ARNN (TARNN) model using residual modelling approach that performs considerably well for confirmed cases of COVID-19 forecasting for the countries that includes the ones with the highest number of cases USA, followed by India, Brazil, Russia. The proposed TARNN model filters linearity using the Theta model and can better explain the linear, nonlinear and non-stationary tendencies present in the selected COVID-19 data sets as compared to the traditional single and hybrid models. It also yields better forecast accuracy than various traditional single and hybrid models like ARIMA, GARCH, Theta, ARNN, WBF-ARIMA, WBF-GARCH and ARIMA-ARNN for six out of eight countries which are USA, India, Russia, Spain and Iran. The proposal will be useful in decision and policy makings for government officials and policymakers to allocate adequate health care resources for the coming days in responding to the crisis. Time series of epidemics can oscillate heavily due to various epidemiological factors and these fluctuations are challenging to be captured adequately for precise forecasting. This newly-developed model can still predict with better accuracy provided the conditions of asymptotic stationarity of hybrid model are satisfied. This method can be used to update real-time forecasts as more data becomes available. The study covering multiple countries can be utilized without geographical borders, and reflect the impact of of social distancing, wearing masks, lock down, shutdown, quarantine and sanitizing properly measures implemented by authorities. Both the short-term and long-term out of sample forecasts show oscillatory behaviour with upward trend and don't show any stiff decay sooner except Iran. All the seven different countries except Spain are going to face unlike uplifts in the number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 pandemic. Followed by the both shortterm and long-term out of sample forecasts reported in this paper, the lockdown and shutdown periods can be adjusted accordingly to handle the uncertain and vulnerable situations of COVID-19 pandemic. The newly-developed Theta-ARNN (TARNN) can efficiently predict COVID-19 cases, compared to traditional single and hybrid models.\nPrevalent techniques in literature were unable to completely capture the nonlinear behavior of stochastic time series containing inherent random shock component. This new method have significant theoretical (established ergodicity and stationarity of the proposed TARNN process) as well as practical implications. Authorities and health care can modify their planning in stockpile and hospital-beds depending on these forecasts of the COVID-19 pandemic."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Future Challenges", "text": "This work developed a novel hybrid Theta-ARNN (TARNN) to predict the subsequent COVID-19 outbreaks accurately and respond to pandemics more efficiently. Our proposed model is useful for nowcasting and forecasting of COVID-19 and the model can be further improved for multivariate time series set up when one get data sets on exogenous variables that impact on COVID-19 daily cases. Many parameters associated with COVID-19 transmission are still poorly understood. The resulting model uncertainty is not always calculated or reported in a standardized way. Once we can incorporate these variables, we can improve our estimates and update the TARNN model accordingly.\nSince purely statistical approaches don't account for how transmission occurs, they are generally not well suited for long-term predictions about epidemiological dynamics (such as when the peak will occur and whether resurgence will happen) or for inference about intervention efficacy. Most forecasting models therefore limit their projections to one week or a few weeks ahead. Also, the problem of using confirmed cases to fit models is further complicated by the fact that the fraction of cases that are confirmed is spatially heterogeneous and time-varying. Amid enormous uncertainty about the future of the COVID-19 pandemic, the proposed TARNN model yields quantitative projections that policymakers may need in the short term to allocate resources or plan interventions. To conclude this model can further be extended for similar non-linear and non-Gaussian forecasting problems arising in other applied domains.\nAll rights reserved.
