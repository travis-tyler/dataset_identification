[{"section_title": "", "text": "In 2016, there were 620,489 students enrolled in S&E graduate programs in the United States, with 75% enrolled as full-time students. Fifty-eight percent of those enrolled in S&E graduate programs were men, and 61% were U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Female enrollment in S&E graduate programs grew to 261,575 in 2016, with 32% of those being temporary visa holders (table 1). Overall S&E graduate enrollment of U.S. citizens and permanent residents decreased 0.8% between 2015 and 2016. The GSS collects data on race and ethnicity only for U.S. citizens and permanent residents. Among U.S. citizens and permanent residents, S&E graduate enrollment for Hispanics or Latinos increased 4.7% between 2015 and 2016, continuing a pattern of growth that started in 2008. Among the non-Hispanic subgroups, the number of Asian S&E graduate students and the number of S&E graduate students reporting more than one race showed continued growth, up 2.6% and 4.8%, respectively, between 2015 and 2016. The S&E graduate enrollment for the remaining race and ethnicity categories all declined in 2016, with American Indian or Alaska Native as well as Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander showing the largest percent decrease between 2015 and 2016 (-7.6% and -7.8%, respectively) (table 1)."}, {"section_title": "Graduate Enrollment, by S&E Field", "text": "In 2016, 73% of the 620,489 S&E graduate students were enrolled in science fields and the remainder were enrolled in engineering fields. Graduate enrollment in five of the nine science fields declined from 2015 to 2016, with psychology experiencing the largest decline at -4.3%, followed by earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences (-2.8%), social sciences (-2.4%), agricultural sciences (-1.8%), and biological sciences (-1.2%). Computer sciences graduate enrollment increased for the fifth straight year in 2016, experiencing 7.5% growth from 2015 and 21.0% growth since 2014. The remaining science fields also showed graduate enrollment growth between 2015 and 2016, with mathematics and statistics increasing by 6.1%, followed by other sciences (5.3%) and physical sciences (0.3%) (table 2). Graduate enrollment in engineering declined for the first time since 2011 to 168,443 students in 2016, down 0.5% from 2015. This decrease was mostly due to decreased enrollment in two of the historically larger engineering fields: electrical engineering  (-5.4%) and civil engineering (-1.9%). Decreased graduate enrollment in industrial and manufacturing engineering (-0.5%) added to the overall decline (table 2)."}, {"section_title": "Postdoctoral Appointees in SEH Fields", "text": "In 2016, a total of 64,712 postdoctoral appointees (postdocs) were conducting research in science, engineering, and health (SEH) fields at U.S. academic institutions and their affiliated research centers and hospitals. The total number of SEH postdocs increased by 1.3% from 2015. This was mainly due to an increase in the number of health postdocs (2.2%) and an increase in the number of U.S. citizen and permanent resident S&E postdocs (3.1%) who constitute the minority (44.2%) of the total S&E postdocs (table 3). The number of S&E postdocs experienced a 1.0% increase from 2015 to 2016 to a total of 45,737. In 2016, the number of S&E postdocs increased for both men (1.1%) and women (0.7%), but the share of female S&E postdocs remains at its historical high, hovering at or near 36%, which began in 2011 (table 3). Within S&E fields, the largest percent increases from 2015 to 2016 in the number of S&E postdocs were for other engineering (22.4%), multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary studies (12.7%), and other sciences (8.6%)."}, {"section_title": "Nonfaculty Researchers in SEH Fields", "text": "The total number of doctorate-holding nonfaculty researchers (NFRs) in SEH fields grew 8.6% between 2014 and 2016, increasing 1.8% between 2015 and 2016 to 25,747. 2 In 2016, biological sciences employed the largest share of SEH NFRs at 27.4%, followed by health (25.8%) and engineering (12.3%). Men hold a larger share of NFRs in the science fields and in engineering (60.7% and 77.3%, respectively), whereas men made up only 49.9% of the NFRs in health fields (table 4).

This 2014 frame update added over the previous frame a total of 15,848 SEH graduate students, an increase of 2.4%; 1,214 SEH postdocs, an increase of 1.9%; and 416 SEH NFRs, an increase of 1.8%. Because of the survey frame update, data comparisons across years should be made with caution. This is especially true for counts; however, proportions or shares are typically robust enough to allow for such comparisons. In this report, the data comparisons between 2014 and earlier years use the \"2014old\" data, and those between 2014 and 2016 use the \"2014new\" data. The effect of the frame update can be evaluated by using the \"2014old\" and \"2014new\" data. For more information on the survey frame update, see the special report Assessing the Impact of Frame Changes on Trend Data from the Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering. 4 In 2011, the GSS field taxonomy was updated to conform to the 2010 CIP. The impact on overall GSS counts because of this change was minimal, as described in appendix A, \"Technical Notes\" in Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering: Fall 2011. 5 "}]
