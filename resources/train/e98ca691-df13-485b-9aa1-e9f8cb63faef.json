Establishing reliable indicators of the current state of school crime and safety across the nation and regularly updating and monitoring these indicators are important in ensuring the safety of our nation's students. This is the aim of Indicators of School Crime and Safety. x In 2013, approximately 3 percent of students ages 12-18 reported being victimized at school during the previous 6 months. Two percent of students reported theft, 1 percent reported violent victimization, and less than one-half of 1 percent reported serious violent victimization.

Any instance of crime or violence at school not only affects the individuals involved but also may disrupt the educational process and affect bystanders, the school itself, and the surrounding community (Brookmeyer, Fanti, and Henrich 2006;Goldstein, Young, and Boyd 2008). For both students and teachers, victimization at school can have lasting effects. In addition to experiencing loneliness, depression, and adjustment difficulties (Crick and Bigbee 1998;Crick and Grotpeter 1996;Nansel et al. 2001;Prinstein, Boergers, and Vernberg 2001;Storch et al. 2003), victimized children are more prone to truancy (Ringwalt, Ennett, and Johnson 2003), poor academic performance (MacMillan and Hagan 2004;Wei and Williams 2004), dropping out of school (Beauvais et al. 1996;MacMillan and Hagan 2004), and violent behaviors (Nansel et al. 2003). For teachers, incidents of victimization may lead to professional disenchantment and even departure from the profession altogether (Karcher 2002;Smith and Smith 2006). For parents, school staff, and policymakers to effectively address school crime, they need an accurate understanding of the extent, nature, and context of the problem. However, it is difficult to gauge the scope of crime and violence in schools given the large amount of attention devoted to isolated incidents of extreme school violence. Measuring progress toward safer schools requires establishing good indicators of the current state of school crime and safety across the nation and regularly updating and monitoring these indicators; this is the aim of Indicators of School Crime and Safety."}, {"section_title": "Purpose and Organization of This Report", "text": "Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2014 is the seventeenth in a series of reports produced since 1998 by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) that present the most recent data available on school crime and student safety. Although the data presented in this report are the most recent data available at the time of publication, the data do not cover the most recent two or more school years. The report is not intended to be an exhaustive compilation of school crime and safety information, nor does it attempt to explore reasons for crime and violence in schools. Rather, it is designed to provide a brief summary of information from an array of data sources and to make data on national school crime and safety accessible to policymakers, educators, parents, and the general public. Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2014 is organized into sections that delineate specific concerns to readers, starting with a description of the most serious violent crimes. The sections cover violent deaths; nonfatal student and teacher victimization; school environment; fights, weapons, and illegal substances; fear and avoidance; discipline, safety, and security measures, and campus safety and security. Each section contains a set of indicators that, taken together, aim to describe a distinct aspect of school crime and safety. Where available, data on crimes that occur outside of school grounds are offered as a point of comparison. 1 Supplemental tables for each indicator provide more detailed breakouts and standard errors for estimates. A glossary of terms and a reference section appear at the end of the report. This edition of the report contains updated data for sixteen indicators: violent deaths at school and away from school (Indicator 1), incidence of victimization at school and away from school (Indicator 2), prevalence of victimization at school (Indicator 3), threats and injuries with weapons on school property (Indicator 4), students' reports of gangs at school (Indicator 8), students' reports of illegal drug availability on school property (Indicator 9), students' reports of being called hate-related words and seeing hate-related graffiti (Indicator 10), bullying at school and cyber-bullying anywhere (Indicator 11), physical fights on school property and anywhere (Indicator 13), students carrying weapons on school property and anywhere and students' access to firearms (Indicator 14), students' use of alcohol on school property and anywhere (Indicator 15), students' use of marijuana on school property and anywhere (Indicator 16 ), students' perceptions of personal safety at school and away from school (Indicator 17), students' reports of avoiding school activities or classes or specific places in school (Indicator 18), students' reports of safety and security measures observed at school (Indicator 21), and criminal incidents at postsecondary institutions (Indicator 22). In addition, this year's report introduces a new indicator on hate crime incidents at postsecondary institutions (Indicator 23). Also included in this year's report are references to publications relevant to each indicator that the reader may want to consult for additional information or analyses. These references can be found in the \"For more information\" sidebars at the bottom of each indicator. The combination of multiple, independent sources of data provides a broad perspective on school crime and safety that could not be achieved through any single source of information. However, readers should be cautious when comparing data from different sources. While every effort has been made to keep key definitions consistent across indicators, differences in sampling procedures, populations, time periods, and question phrasing can all affect the comparability of results. For example, both Indicators 20 and 21 report data on selected security and safety measures used in schools. Indicator 20 uses data collected from a schools and staffing survey administered to public and private school principals about safety and security practices used in their schools for the 2011-12 school year, as well as from a survey of public school principals about safety and security practices used in their schools during the 2009-10 school year. The schools range from primary through high schools. Indicator 21, however, uses data collected from 12through 18-year-old students residing in a sample of households. These students were asked whether they observed selected safety and security measures in their school in 2013, but they may not have known whether, in fact, the security measure was present. In addition, different indicators contain various approaches to the analysis of school crime data and, therefore, will show different perspectives on school crime. For example, both Indicators 2 and 3 report data on theft and violent victimization at school based on the National Crime Victimization Survey and the School Crime Supplement to that survey, respectively. While Indicator 2 examines the number of incidents of victimization, Indicator 3 examines the percentage or prevalence of students who reported victimization. Table A provides a summary of some of the variations in the design and coverage of sample surveys used in this report. Several indicators in this report are based on selfreported survey data. Readers should note that limitations inherent to self-reported data may affect estimates (Addington 2005;Cantor and Lynch 2000). First, unless an interview is \"bounded\" or a reference period is established, estimates may include events that exceed the scope of the specified reference period. This factor may artificially increase reported incidents because respondents may recall events outside of the given reference period. Second, many of the surveys rely on the respondent to \"self-determine\" a condition. This factor allows the respondent to define a situation based upon his or her own interpretation of whether the incident was a crime or not. On the other hand, the same situation may not necessarily be interpreted in the same way by a bystander or the perceived offender. Third, victim surveys tend to emphasize crime events as incidents that take place at one point in time. However, victims can often experience a state of victimization in which they are threatened or victimized regularly or repeatedly. Finally, respondents may recall an event inaccurately. For instance, people may forget the event entirely or recall the specifics of the episode incorrectly. These and other factors may affect the precision of the estimates based on these surveys. Data trends are discussed in this report when possible. Where trends are not discussed, either the data are not available in earlier surveys or the wording of the survey question changed from year to year, eliminating the ability to discuss any trend. Where data from samples are reported, as is the case with most of the indicators in this report, the standard error is calculated for each estimate provided in order to determine the \"margin of error\" for these estimates. The standard errors of the estimates for different subpopulations in an indicator can vary considerably and should be taken into account when making comparisons. With the exception of Indicator 2, in this report, in cases where the standard error was between 30 and 50 percent of the associated estimate, the estimates were noted with a \"!\" symbol (Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between 30 and Introduction 4 a high ratio of standard error to estimate so the reader should use caution when interpreting such data. These estimates are still discussed, however, when statistically significant differences are found despite large standard errors. The comparisons in the text have been tested for statistical significance to ensure that the differences are larger than might be expected due to sampling variation. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons cited in the report are statistically significant at the .05 level. Several test procedures were used, depending upon the type of data being analyzed and the nature of the comparison being tested. The primary test procedure used in this report was Student's t statistic, which tests the difference between two sample estimates. The t test formula was not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Linear trend tests were used to examine changes in percentages over a range of values such as time or age. Linear trends tests allow one to examine whether, for example, the percentage of students who reported using drugs increased (or decreased) over time or whether the percentage of students who reported being physically attacked in school increased (or decreased) with age. When differences among percentages were examined relative to a variable with ordinal categories (such as grade), analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for a linear relationship between the two variables.

Victims of school-associated violent deaths include not only students and staff members, but also others who are not students or staff members, such as parents. Between July 1, 2011 and June 30, 2012, there were a total of 45 school-associated violent deaths in elementary and secondary schools in the United States (figure 1.1 and table 1.1). Of the 45 student, staff, and nonstudent school-associated violent deaths occurring during this time span, there were 26 homicides, 14 suicides, and 5 legal interventions. Data for school-associated violent deaths for the 2011-12 school year are preliminary until interviews with law enforcement personnel have been completed. Data on violent deaths occurring away from school were included in order to compare them to data on violent deaths occurring at school. The most recent data available for total suicides of school-age youth (ages 5-18; referred to as youth in the remainder of the indicator) are for the 2011 calendar year; the most recent data available for total homicides of youth are for the 2011-12 school year. 4 During the 2011-12 school year, there were 1,199 homicides of youth (figure 1.2 and table 1.1). During the 2011 calendar year, there were 1,568 suicides of youth. During the 2011-12 school year, there were 15 homicides and 5 suicides of school-age youth at school (figure 1.1 and table 1.1). When instances of homicide and suicide of school-age youth at school were combined, there was approximately 1 homicide or suicide for each 2.7 million students enrolled. 5 The percentage of youth homicides occurring at school remained at less than 2 percent of the total number of youth homicides over all available survey years, even though the absolute number of homicides of schoolage youth at school varied to some degree across the years (figure 1.1 and table 1.1). Between 1992-93 and 2011-12, from 1 to 10 school-age youth committed suicide at school each year, with no consistent pattern of increase or decrease in the number of suicides. The percentage of youth suicides occurring at school remained at less than 1 percent of the total number of youth suicides over all available survey years.

The 2013 violent victimization rates were 37 per 1,000 students at school and 15 per 1,000 students away from school. This difference was driven primarily by higher rates of simple assault at school. In 6 2013, data from the National Crime Victimization Survey showed that students ages 12-18 experienced more victimizations at school than away from school. 7 Students ages 12-18 experienced about 1,420,900 nonfatal victimizations (theft 8 and violent victimization 9 ) at school, compared with about 778,500 nonfatal victimizations away from school (table 2.1). These figures represent total crime victimization rates of 55 victimizations per 1,000 students at school and 30 per 1,000 students away from school. For most of the years between 1992 and 2008 and in 2012, the rate of theft at school was higher than the rate of theft away from school among students ages 12-18 (figure 2.1). There were no measurable differences between the rates of theft at school and away from school in 2009, 2010, 2011, or 2013. At school, the rate of theft was lower in 2013 (18 thefts per 1,000 students) than in 2012 (24 thefts per 1,000 students). The rate of theft away from school was not measurably different between 2012 and 2013. In 2013, the rate of theft away from school was 16 per 1,000 students. Between 1992 and 2000, the rate of violent victimization per 1,000 students at school was either lower than the rate away from school or not measurably different than the rate away from school.

Theft does not include robbery, which involves the threat or use of force and is classified as a violent crime. 9 \"Violent victimization\" includes serious violent crimes and simple assault. students at school has generally been higher than the rate away from school or not measurably different than the rate away from school. In 2013, the rate of violent victimization at school (37 per 1,000 students) was greater than the rate of violent victimization away from school (15 per 1,000 students). This difference was driven primarily by higher rates of simple assault 10 at school (33 per 1,000 students) than away from school that year (9 per 1,000). The rate of serious violent victimization 11 against students ages 12-18 was generally lower at school than away from school in most survey years between 1992 and 2008. There were no measurable differences in the rates at school and away from school between 2009 and 2013. Between 1992 and 2013, the total victimization rates for students ages 12-18 generally declined both at and away from school (figure 2.1). The total victimization rate against students ages 12-18 at school declined 70 percent from 181 victimizations per 1,000 students in 1992 to 55 victimizations per 1,000 students in 2013. Away from school, the rate of total victimization declined 83 percent from 173 victimizations per 1,000 students to 30 victimizations per 1,000.

At school, there was no measurable difference between the rates of serious violent victimization for students ages 12-18 in 2012 and in 2013. There was also no measurable difference between 2012 and 2013 in the rates of serious violent victimizations away from school for students ages 12-18. In 2013, students experienced about 5 serious violent victimizations per 1,000 students at school and 6 victimizations per 1,000 students away from school. This pattern also held for thefts, violent victimizations, and serious violent victimizations between 1992 and 2013. Thefts at school declined from a rate of 114 per 1,000 students to 18 per 1,000, and the rate of theft away from school decreased from 79 thefts per 1,000 students to 16 per 1,000. The rate of violent victimization at school declined overall from 68 victimizations per 1,000 students in 1992 to 37 per 1,000 in 2013; however, this rate increased between 2010 and 2013 (from 17 to 37 per 1,000 students). Away from school, the rate of violent victimization declined from 94 victimizations per 1,000 students in 1992 to 15 victimizations per 1,000 students in 2013.

The victimization rates for students in 2013 varied according to student characteristics. The total victimization rate at school was greater for students ages 12-14 (67 per 1,000 students) than for students ages 15-18 (44 per 1,000 students; table 2.2 and figure 2.2). This difference was due primarily to the higher rate of violent victimization at school for younger students (52 per 1,000 students ages 12- 14) compared with older students (24 per 1,000 students ages [15][16][17][18]. No measurable differences were detected between age groups in the rates of theft victimization at school or in the rates of total victimization, theft, and violent victimization away from school in 2013. In 2013, there were no measurable differences between the rates of total victimization, theft, and violence at school for males and females. There were also no measurable differences between the rates of total victimization, theft, and violence away from school for males and females in 2013. In 2013, the rate of nonfatal victimization for males was 62 victimizations per 1,000 students at school and the nonfatal victimization rate for females was 47 victimizations per 1,000 students at school (figure 2.3). Away from school, the nonfatal victimization rate for males was 29 victimizations per 1,000 students, and the nonfatal victimization rate for females was 31 victimizations per 1,000 students. The rate of violent victimization for males at school was 43 victimizations per 1,000 students, and the violent victimization rate for females at school was 31 victimizations per 1,000 students. Away from school, the violent victimization rate for males was 13 victimizations per 1,000 students, and the violent victimization rate for females was 16 victimizations per 1,000 students. Students residing in rural areas had lower rates of nonfatal victimization at school than students residing in urban and suburban areas. Nonfatal victimization rates at school were 32 per 1,000 students in rural areas, compared with 57 per 1,000 students in urban areas and 60 per 1,000 students in suburban areas. Students residing in rural areas also had a lower rate of theft victimization away from school (11 per 1,000 students) compared to students residing in urban areas (20 per 1,000 students).

The School Crime Supplement (SCS) to the National Crime Victimization Survey collects data on bullying 29 and cyber-bullying 30 by asking students ages 12-18 if they had been bullied at school 31 and cyber-bullied anywhere during the school year. Students were also asked about the types and frequencies of bullying and cyber-bullying they had been subjected to, as well as whether an adult at school 32 had been notified of the incidents. Cyberbullying is distinct from bullying at school; however, bullying at school might be a pertinent context to understand cyber-bullying anywhere. In the SCS, survey items on cyber-bullying anywhere were asked separately from survey items on bullying at school. In a different survey, the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), students in grades 9-12 were asked if they had been bullied on school property 33 or electronically bullied during the previous 12 months. In addition to collecting data at the national level, the YRBS also collects data at the state level. Readers should take note of the differing data sources and terminology. On the SCS in 2013, about 22 percent of students ages 12-18 reported being bullied at school during the school year (figure 11.1 and table 11.1).

Of those students who reported being pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on at school, about 21 percent reported injury as a result of the incident. Additionally, about 4 percent of all students reported being excluded from activities on purpose, 4 percent reported being threatened with harm, 2 percent reported that others tried to make them do things they did not want to do, and 2 percent reported that their property was destroyed by others on purpose. In 2013, a higher percentage of females than of males ages 12-18 reported being bullied at school during the school year (24 vs. 19 percent). Also, higher percentages of females than of males reported that they were made fun of, called names, or insulted (15 vs. 13 percent); were the subject of rumors (17 vs. 10 percent); and were excluded from activities on purpose (5 vs. 4 percent). In contrast, a higher percentage of males (7 percent) than of females (5 percent) reported being pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on.

In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public school principals were asked to provide the number of violent incidents, 18 serious violent incidents, 19 thefts of items valued at $10 or greater without personal confrontation, and other incidents 20 that occurred at their school. 21 Public school principals were also asked to provide the number of incidents they reported to the police. This indicator presents the percentage of public schools that recorded one or more of these specified crimes, the total number of these crimes recorded, and the rate of crimes per 1,000 students. These data are also presented for crimes that were reported to the police. In all survey years the percentage of public schools that recorded incidents of crime was between 85 and 86 percent, with the exception of school year 2003-04. In 2003-04, the percentage of public schools that recorded incidents of crime was 89 percent.

During the 2009-10 school year, 85 percent of public schools recorded that one or more of these incidents of violence, theft, or other crimes had taken place, amounting to an estimated 1.9 million crimes (figure 6.1 and table 6.1). This figure translates to a rate of approximately 40 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled in 2009-10. During the same year, 60 percent of schools reported one of the specified crimes to the police, amounting to about 689,000 crimes-or 15 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled. In 2009-10, a greater percentage of schools recorded an incident of crime than reported an incident of crime to the police. This pattern held true for violent crimes, serious violent crimes, thefts, and other crimes. Seventy-four percent of schools recorded one or more violent incidents of crime (a rate of 25 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled), 16 percent recorded one or more serious violent incidents (a rate of 1 crime per 1,000 students enrolled), 44 percent recorded one or more thefts (a rate of 5 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled), and 68 percent recorded one or more other incidents (a rate of 9 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled).

For example, by school level, primary schools recorded lower percentages of these types of crimes than middle schools and high schools: 64 percent of primary schools recorded violent incidents of crime compared with 91 percent each of middle schools and high schools (figure 6.2 and table 6.2). A lower percentage of primary schools recorded serious violent incidents of crime (13 percent) than middle or high schools (19 and 28 percent, respectively), a lower percentage of primary schools recorded incidents of theft (26 percent) than middle or high schools (65 and 83 percent, respectively), and a lower percentage of primary schools recorded other incidents (57 percent) than middle or high schools (82 and 92 percent, respectively). A similar pattern was observed for public schools that reported such incidents of violent crime, serious violent crime, theft, and other incidents to the police. The percentages of primary schools that reported incidents of these types of crime to the police were lower than for middle schools and high schools (figure  6.2 and table 6.3). Data on the number of crimes recorded and reported by schools in 2009-10 were categorized by frequency range as well. For example, 26 percent of schools  recorded zero violent crimes, and 19 percent of schools  recorded 20 or more violent crimes (figure 6.3 and  table 6.4). Sixty percent of schools did not report a violent crime to the police, while 5 percent of schools reported 20 or more violent crimes to the police. With regard to serious violent crimes, 84 percent of schools did not record a serious violent crime, and 2 percent of schools recorded 10 or more such crimes. Ninety percent of schools did not report a serious violent crime to the police, and 1 percent of schools reported 10 or more serious violent crimes to the police (table 6.5). The number of crimes recorded by schools by frequency range varied by school characteristics. A larger percentage of city schools recorded 20 or more violent incidents in 2009-10 than suburban schools or rural schools (table 6.4). In 2009-10, this amounts to about 25 percent of city schools recording 20 or more violent incidents, compared with 19 percent of suburban schools and 14 percent of rural schools.  1 \"Violent incidents\" include rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attack or fight with or without a weapon, threat of physical attack with or without a weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon. 2 \"Serious violent incidents\" include rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attack or fight with a weapon, threat of physical attack with a weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon.

The percentage of students who reported carrying weapons anywhere was lower in 2013 (18 percent) than in 1993 (22 percent) or 1995 (20 percent). There were no measurable differences between the 2011 and 2013 percentages of students who reported carrying a weapon either anywhere or on school property during the previous 30 days. In every survey year from 1993 to 2013, a higher percentage of male students than of female students reported that they had carried a weapon, both anywhere and on school property. In 2013, for example, 28 percent of male students reported carrying a weapon anywhere, compared with 8 percent of female students. In addition, 8 percent of male students reported carrying a weapon on school property, compared with 3 percent of female students. In 2013, the percentage of White students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere in the previous 30 days (21 percent) was higher than the percentages of Hispanic students (16 percent), Pacific Islander and Black students (13 percent each), and Asian students (9 percent) who reported doing so (figure 14.2 and table 14.1). In addition, higher percentages of students of Two or more races (19 percent) and Hispanic students than of Black students and Asian students reported carrying a weapon anywhere during the period. The percentage of American Indian/Alaska Native students (18 percent) who reported carrying a weapon anywhere was also higher than the percentage of Asian students. With respect to students reporting that they carried a weapon on school property during the previous 30 days, a higher percentage of White students (6 percent) than of Black students (4 percent) reported that they had carried a weapon during the previous 30 days."}, {"section_title": "Indicator 14 continued on page 64.", "text": "This indicator has been updated to include 2013 data.

There were no measurable differences by grade in the percentages of students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere or on school property at least 1 day during the previous 30 days in 2013: About 18 percent of students at each of grade levels 9 through 12 reported carrying a weapon anywhere during the previous 30 days, and 5 percent each of 9th-, 10th-, and 12th-graders and 6 percent of 11th-graders reported carrying a weapon on school property. However, a higher percentage of 12th-graders (11 percent) than of 9th-and 10th-graders (8 percent each) reported carrying a weapon anywhere on 6 or more days during the previous 30 days (table 14.2). In 2013, state-level data on percentages of public school students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere were available for 34 states (table 14.3). Among these states, the percentages of students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere ranged from 10 percent in New Jersey and Hawaii to 29 percent in Wyoming. There were also 34 states that had 2013 data available on the percentages of students reporting that they carried a weapon on school property during the previous 30 days; the percentages ranged from 3 percent in New Jersey, Delaware, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, and Nevada to 10 percent in Montana, Wyoming, and Vermont. The majority of states had ratios between 1.0 and 10.0 firearm possession incidents per 100,000 students from 2008-09 to 2012-13. During the 2012-13 school year, eight states and the District of Columbia had ratios of firearm possession incidents per 100,000 students that were at or below 1.0. The eight states were: Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Jersey, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and West Virginia. All of these states, with the exception of West Virginia, had ratios of firearm incidents per 100,000 students that were at or below 1.0 in the 2011-12 school year as well. During the 2012-13 school year, three states had ratios above 10.0: Arkansas, Missouri, and Wyoming. However, only one of these states, Arkansas, also had a ratio above 10.0 during the 2011-12 school year. During 2011-12, Utah was the only other state with a ratio above 10.0 firearm possession incidents per 100,000 students. Information about students' access to firearms can put student reports of carrying a gun anywhere and on school property into context. In the SCS survey, students were asked if they could have gotten a loaded gun without adult permission, either at school or away from school, during the current school year. In 2013, about 4 percent of students ages 12-18 reported having access to a loaded gun without adult permission, either at school or away from school, during the current school year (figure 14.3 and table 14.4). The percentage of 12-to 18-year-old students reporting that they had access to a loaded gun without adult permission decreased from 7 percent in 2007 (the first year of data collection for this item) to 4 percent in 2013. There was no measurable difference between the percentages who reported having such access to a loaded gun between 2011 and 2013. In every survey year from 2007 to 2011, a higher percentage of male students than of female students ages 12-18 reported having access to a loaded gun without adult permission. However, there was no measurable difference between the percentages of male and female students who reported having such access to a loaded gun in 2013. The percentage of male students who reported having access to a loaded gun without adult permission was lower in 2013 than in 2011 (4 vs. 6 percent). The percentages of female students who reported having such access to a loaded gun were not measurably different between these two years. In 2013, higher percentages of 10th-, 11th-, and 12th-graders reported having access to a loaded gun without adult permission than did 7th-and 8th-graders. About 5 percent of 10th-graders and 6 percent each of 11th-and 12th-graders reported having access to a loaded gun without adult supervision, compared with 2 percent each of 7thand 8th-graders. The percentage of 11th-graders reporting that they had access to a gun without adult supervision was also higher than the percentage of 9th-graders reporting such access (3 percent). Reported incidents involving students who brought or possessed firearms at school are also important to examine. As part of the EDFacts data collection, state education agencies report the number of incidents involving students who brought or possessed firearms at school. State education agencies compile these data based on incidents that were reported by their schools and school districts. During the 2012-13 school year, there were 1,556 reported firearm possession incidents at school in the United States (table 14.5). The total number of incidents varied widely across states, due in large part to the differing populations at the state level. Therefore, the ratio of firearm possession incidents per 100,000 students can provide a more comparable indication of the frequency of these incidents across states. During the 2012-13 school year, the ratio of firearm possession incidents per 100,000 students in the United States was 3.1.

In 2013, the percentage of students who reported consuming alcohol increased with grade level. About 47 percent of 12th-graders reported consuming alcohol on at least 1 day during the previous 30 days (figure 15.3 and table 15.1). This percentage was higher than the percentages for 9th-graders (24 percent), 10th-graders (31 percent), and 11th-graders (39 percent).

The percentage of Black students who reported consuming alcohol at least 1 day was lower than the percentages reported by White students, Hispanic students, and students of Two or more races. In 2013, state-level data on the percentages of students who reported consuming alcohol were available for 41 states (table 15.3).

The student offenses were physical attacks or fights; distribution, possession, or use of alcohol; distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs; use or possession of a firearm or explosive device; and use or possession of a weapon other than a firearm or explosive device. During the 2009-10 school year, 39 percent of public schools (32,300 schools) took at least one serious disciplinary action-including suspensions lasting 5 days or more, removals with no services for the remainder of the school year (i.e., expulsions), and transfers to specialized schools-for specific offenses (table 19.1). Out of all offenses reported, physical attacks or fights prompted the largest percentage of schools (29 percent) to respond with at least one serious disciplinary action (figure 19.1 and table 19.1). In response to other offenses by students, 20 percent of schools reported that they took disciplinary action for the distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs; 13 percent took action for the use or possession of a weapon other than a firearm or explosive device; 9 percent did so for the distribution, possession, or use of alcohol; and 3 percent did so for the use or possession of a firearm or explosive device. No linear trends were detected in the percentages of schools that took at least one serious disciplinary action for any of the reported offenses over time between 2003-04 and 2009-10, although the percentage of schools taking at least one serious disciplinary action for physical attacks or fights declined between 1999-2000 (35 percent) and 2009-10 (29 percent). During the 2009-10 school year, the percentage of public schools that took serious disciplinary actions increased with school level. A higher percentage of high schools (83 percent) took at least one serious disciplinary action than did middle schools (67 percent) and primary schools (18 percent). Combined schools (schools that provide instruction at both elementary and secondary grades) took at least one serious disciplinary action at a higher percentage (49 percent) than primary schools, but at a lower percentage than either middle schools or high schools. This pattern by school level was generally observed for disciplinary actions taken in response to specific offenses as well. For example, 66 percent of high schools took serious disciplinary actions in response to distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs, compared with 37 percent of middle schools, 23 percent of combined schools, and 2 percent of primary schools. A total of 433,800 serious disciplinary actions were taken by public schools during the 2009-10 school year for specific offenses. Most of these reported disciplinary actions were taken in response to physical attacks or fights (265,100 actions). The number of disciplinary actions taken in response to the use or possession of a firearm or explosive device (5,800 actions) was smaller than for other offenses reported. Of the serious disciplinary actions taken during the 2009-10 school year, 74 percent were suspensions for 5 days or more, 20 percent were transfers to specialized schools, and 6 percent were removals with no services for the remainder of the school year.

In the 2009-10 school year, 43 percent of schools reported the presence of one or more security staff at their school at least once a week during the school year. Schools use a variety of practices and procedures to promote the safety of students and staff. In the Schools and Staffing Survey, principals of public and private schools were asked about their schools' use of safety and security measures and procedures. Certain practices, such as locking or monitoring doors or gates, are intended to limit or control access to school campuses, while others, such as the use of metal detectors and security cameras, are intended to monitor or restrict students' and visitors' behavior on campus. Another measure of safety and security, collected in the School Survey on Crime and Safety, is the presence of full-time and part-time security staff in public schools during the school year. In the 2011-12 school year, 88 percent of public schools reported that they controlled access to school buildings by locking or monitoring doors during school hours (table 20.1). Other safety and security measures frequently reported by public schools included the use of security cameras to monitor the school (64 percent) and the enforcement of a strict dress code (49 percent; figure 20.1). In addition, 44 percent of public schools reported that they controlled access to school grounds by locking or monitoring gates during school hours, 24 percent reported the use of random dog sniffs to check for drugs, and 19 percent required that students wear uniforms. In general, higher percentages of public than of private schools reported the use of various safety and security measures in the 2011-12 school year (table 20.1). For example, higher percentages of public than of private schools reported the use of security cameras (64 vs. 41 percent) and random dog sniffs to check for drugs (24 vs. 4 percent). Higher percentages of public than of private schools also reported the following measures: controlling access to school buildings during school hours; requiring that students wear badges or picture IDs; requiring that book bags be clear or banning them from school; conducting metal detector checks on students (including both random and daily checks); and conducting random sweeps for contraband. 45 However, higher percentages of private than of public schools enforced a strict dress code (71 vs. 49 percent) and required that students wear uniforms (57 vs. 19 percent).  In the 2011-12 school year, higher percentages of public secondary schools or combined schools than of elementary schools reported using the following safety and security measures: enforcing a strict dress code; requiring that students wear badges or picture IDs; requiring that book bags be clear or banning them from school; conducting metal detector checks on students (including both random and daily checks); using random dog sniffs to check for drugs; conducting random sweeps for contraband; 46 and using security cameras to monitor the school (table  20.2). For example, among public schools, 81 percent of secondary schools, 72 percent of combined schools, and 58 percent of elementary schools reported the use of security cameras to monitor the school (table 20.1). In addition, the percentage of public secondary schools who reported using random dog sniffs for drugs (57 percent) was higher than the percentages of combined schools (41 percent) and elementary schools (11 percent) with such a procedure in place. However, lower percentages of public secondary schools (84 percent) and combined schools (83 percent) than of elementary schools (90 percent) reported controlling access to buildings during school hours. Also, the percentage of public secondary schools who reported requiring that students wear uniforms (12 percent) was lower than the percentages of elementary schools (20 percent) and combined schools (30 percent) with such a requirement. The use of safety and security measures in the 2011-12 school year also varied by public school locale (table 20.2). Higher percentages of public city schools than of public schools in suburban, town, and rural areas reported the following measures: controlling access to school grounds during school hours; requiring that students wear uniforms; enforcing a strict dress code; requiring that students 46 For example, drugs or weapons. Does not include dog sniffs. wear badges or picture IDs; and conducting metal detector checks on students (including both random and daily checks). For example, 55 percent of public city schools reported controlling access to school grounds, compared with 46 percent of suburban schools and 37 percent each of public schools in towns and rural areas. However, public city schools had the lowest reported percentage of schools with security cameras (59 percent of city schools vs. between 65 and 67 percent of rural, suburban, and town schools). In addition, higher percentages of public town and rural schools than of city and suburban schools reported the use of random dog sniffs for drugs and random sweeps for contraband. Many safety and security measures tended to be more prevalent in high-poverty public schools (where 76 percent or more of students are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch) than in low-poverty schools (where 25 percent or less of students are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch) during the 2011-12 school year (table 20.2). Higher percentages of highpoverty public schools than of low-poverty schools reported controlling access to school grounds during school hours; requiring that students wear uniforms; enforcing a strict dress code; requiring that students wear badges or picture IDs; requiring that book bags be clear or banning them from school; conducting metal detector checks on students (including both random and daily checks); and conducting sweeps for contraband. 46 For instance, 64 percent of high-poverty public schools reported enforcing a strict dress code, compared with 38 percent of lowpoverty schools. Also, 47 percent of high-poverty public schools reported requiring school uniforms, compared to 6 percent of low-poverty public schools. Indicator 20 continued on page 90.  The percentages of public schools reporting the use of various safety and security measures in 2011-12 tended to be higher or not measurably different from the percentages reported in 2003-04 (figure 20.2 and  table 20.1). For example, the percentage of public schools reporting that they required that students wear uniforms increased from 13 to 19 percent between the 2003-04 and 2011-12 school years. Public schools' reported use of security cameras to monitor the school increased from 2003-04 (32 percent) to 2011-12 (64 percent). Also, the percentage of public schools reporting that they controlled access to buildings during school hours was higher in 2011-12 than in 2003-04 (88 vs. 82 percent). A similar pattern was observed for controlled access to grounds during school hours (44 percent in 2011-12 vs. 39 percent in 2003-04). In the 2009-10 school year, 43 percent of public schools reported the presence of one or more security guards, security personnel, School Resource Officers, or sworn law enforcement officers at their school at least once a week during the school year (table  20.3). 47 The percentage of public schools reporting the presence of security staff did not measurably differ between 2005-06 (42 percent) and 2009-10 (43 percent); however, the percentage of public schools reporting the presence of security staff was higher in 2007-08 (46 percent) than in either 2005-06 or 2009-10. Twenty-nine percent of public schools reported having at least one full-time employed security staff who was present at least once a week, and 14 percent of public schools reported having only part-time staff. A lower percentage of public schools reported full-time security staff at their school in 2005-06 (27 percent) than in 2007-08 (30 percent), while there were no measurable differences between each of these percentages and the percentage reported in 2009-10 (29 percent). No measurable differences were found across years for the percentages of public schools reporting part-time only security staff. About 28 percent of public primary schools reported the presence of one or more security staff at their school at least once a week in 2009-10. The percentage of public primary schools reporting security staff was lower than the percentages of middle schools and high schools reporting the presence of security staff (66 and 76 percent, respectively) but was not measurably different from the percentage of combined schools reporting the presence of security staff. A higher percentage of public high schools (62 percent) than of primary (16 percent), combined (24 percent), or middle schools (46 percent) reported having full-time security staff (table 20.3). Differences in the presence of security staff were also found by other school characteristics. For example, the percentage of public city schools that reported the presence of one or more security staff at least once a week during the 2009-10 school year (51 percent) was higher than the percentages of town schools (39 percent) and rural schools (35 percent). The percentage of public suburban schools reporting the presence of security staff (45 percent) was also higher than the percentage of rural schools. Public schools were also asked to report whether any of their security staff routinely carried a firearm at school. 48 In 2009-10, some 28 percent of all public schools reported the presence of security staff routinely carrying a firearm (table 20.3). The percentage of public schools reporting security staff routinely carrying firearms was higher in 2007-08 (34 percent) than in either 2005-06 (31 percent) or 2009-10 (28 percent); there was no measurable difference between 2005-06 and 2009-10. Twelve percent of public primary schools, 25 percent of combined schools, 51 percent of middle schools, and 63 percent of high schools reported the presence of one or more security staff at their schools routinely carrying firearms during the 2009-10 school year."}, {"section_title": "Students' Reports of Safety and Security Measures Observed at School", "text": "Indicator 21 In the School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12-18 were asked whether their schools used certain security measures. 49 Security measures include metal detectors, locker checks, security cameras, security guards or assigned police officers, adults supervising hallways, badges or picture identification for students, a written code of student conduct, locked entrance or exit doors during the day, and a requirement that visitors sign in. In 2013, nearly all students ages 12-18 reported that they observed the use of at least one of the selected security measures at their schools (figure 21.1 and table 21.1). In 2013, most students ages 12-18 reported that their schools had a written code of student conduct and a requirement that visitors sign in (96 percent each). Approximately 90 percent of students reported the presence of school staff (other than security guards or assigned police officers) or other adults supervising the hallway, 77 percent reported the use of one or more security cameras at their schools, and 76 percent reported locked entrance or exit doors during the day. About 70 percent of students reported the presence of security guards and/or assigned police officers, 52 percent reported locker checks, and 26 percent reported that students were required to wear badges or picture identification at their schools. Eleven percent of students reported the use of metal detectors at their schools, representing the least observed of the selected safety and security measures. The percentage of students who reported locked entrance or exit doors during the day increased In 2013, about 77 percent of students ages 12-18 reported observing one or more security cameras to monitor the school during the day at their schools, and 76 percent of students reported observing locked entrance or exit doors during the day. between the two most recent survey years, as well as over the past 14 years. Specifically, 76 percent of students reported observing locked entrance or exit doors during the day in 2013, representing an increase from 65 percent in 2011, as well as an overall increase from 38 percent in 1999. The percentage of students who reported the presence of school staff (other than security guards or assigned police officers) or other adults supervising the hallway also was higher in 2013 (90 percent) than in 2011 (89 percent) and in 1999 (85 percent). The percentage of students who reported the presence of metal detectors at school increased from 1999 to 2013 (from 9 to 11 percent), as did the percentage of students who reported the presence of security guards and/or assigned police officers (from 54 to 70 percent) and the percentage of students who reported a requirement that visitors sign in (from 87 to 96 percent). Beginning in 2001, students were asked whether they observed the use of security cameras at school and whether they were required to wear badges or picture identification. From 2001 to 2013, the percentage of students who reported the use of one or more security cameras at school increased from 39 to 77 percent, and the percentage of students who reported that they were required to wear badges or picture identification increased from 21 to 26 percent. No measurable differences were found between the two most recent survey years (2011 and 2013) in the percentages of students reporting these safety and security measures.

There was also a decrease in the number of on-campus crimes reported per 10,000 full-time-equivalent students, from 20.0 in 2011 to 19.4 in 2012. Since 1990, postsecondary institutions participating in Title IV federal student financial aid programs have been required to comply with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, known as the Clery Act. The Clery Act requires institutions to give timely warnings about crimes to students and staff; to publicly report campus crime and safety policies; and to collect, report, and disseminate campus crime data. Since 1999, data on campus safety and security have been reported by institutions through the Campus Safety and Security Survey. These reports include on-campus criminal offenses and arrests involving students, faculty, staff, and the general public. Reports on referrals for disciplinary action primarily deal with persons associated formally with the institution (i.e., students, faculty, and other staff). In 2012, there were 29,500 criminal incidents against persons and property on campus at public and private 2-year and 4-year postsecondary institutions that were reported to police and security agencies, representing a 4 percent decrease from 2011 (30,700; table 22.1). There was also a decrease in the number of on-campus crimes per 10,000 full-time-equivalent (FTE) students, from 20.0 in 2011 to 19.4 in 2012 (table 22.2). Among the various types of on-campus crimes reported in 2012, there were 18,100 burglaries, constituting 61 percent of all criminal incidents (table 22.1 and figure 22.1). Other commonly reported crimes included forcible sex offenses (3,900 incidents, or 13 percent of crimes) and motor vehicle theft (3,000 incidents, or 10 percent of crimes). In addition, 2,400 aggravated assaults and 1,400 robberies were reported. These estimates translate to 11.9 burglaries, 2.6 forcible sex offenses, 2.0 motor vehicle thefts, 1.6 aggravated assaults, and 0.9 robberies per 10,000 FTE students (table 22.2). Eleven murders occurred on college campuses in 2012, fewer than the 16 that occurred in 2011. Looking at on-campus crime patterns over a longer period, the overall number of crimes reported between 2001 and 2012 decreased by 29 percent (table 22.1). Although the number of reported on-campus crimes increased by 7 percent between 2001 and 2006 (from 41,600 to 44,500), the number of crimes decreased by 34 percent (to 29,500) between 2006 and 2012. The number of on-campus crimes reported in 2012 was lower than in 2001 for every category except forcible sex offenses. The number of reported forcible sex crimes on campus increased from 2,200 in 2001 to 3,900 in 2012 (a 77 percent increase). More recently, the number of reported forcible sex crimes increased from 3,400 in 2011 to 3,900 in 2012 (a 15 percent increase). Increases in FTE college enrollment between 2001 and 2012 as well as changes in the number of crimes affected the number of on-campus crimes per 10,000 FTE students (see Digest of Education Statistics 2014 for details about college enrollment). Overall, the number of on-campus crimes per 10,000 students was lower in 2012 (19.4 per 10,000) than in 2001 (35.6 per 10,000; table 22.2). Between 2001 and 2006, enrollment increased by a larger percentage than the number of crimes, which resulted in the number of on-campus crimes per 10,000 students in 2006 (33.3) actually being lower than in 2001 (35.6). Between 2006 and 2012, the number of reported on-campus crimes decreased, enrollment increased, and the number of on-campus crimes per 10,000 students decreased from 33.3 to 19.4. The rates per 10,000 students for all types of reported on-campus crimes other than forcible sex offenses were lower in 2012 than in 2001. In the case of forcible sex offenses, the rate was higher in 2012 (2.6 per 10,000 students) than in 2001 (1.9 per 10,000 students).   2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Number of crimes per 10,000 FTE students In 2012, the number of crimes committed on college campuses differed by type of institution, though to some extent this reflects the enrollment size of the sectors and the presence of student residence halls. For example, more crimes were committed at institutions with residence halls than at institutions without residence halls (table 22.2). Crimes involving students on campus after normal class hours, such as those occurring in residence halls, are included in campus crime reports, while crimes involving students off campus are not. At public 4-year institutions in 2012, some 50 percent of the 14,200 on-campus crimes occurred in residence halls; at nonprofit 4-year institutions, 61 percent of the 10,700 on-campus crimes occurred in residence halls (table 22.1). Burglaries constituted the majority of the reported crimes at both types of institutions."}, {"section_title": "Indicator 23", "text": "Hate Crime Incidents at Postsecondary Criminal Incidents at Postsecondary Institutions"}, {"section_title": "Indicator 22 continued on page 98.", "text": "Although data for different types of institutions are difficult to compare directly because of the differing structures of student services and campus arrangements, there were decreases in the numbers of on-campus crimes at most types of institutions between 2006 and 2012. At public 4-year institutions, the number of on-campus crimes decreased from a high of 20,600 in 2006 to 14,200 in 2012. Also, the number of on-campus crimes per 10,000 students decreased from 35.5 to 21.1 during this period (table 22.2). Similarly, at nonprofit 4-year institutions, the number of crimes decreased from 16,900 in 2006 to 10,700 in 2012, and the number of crimes per 10,000 students decreased from 57.7 to 32.5. At public 2-year institutions, which generally do not have residence halls, the number of crimes decreased from 5,700 to 3,800 between 2006 and 2012, and the number of crimes per 10,000 students decreased from 15.4 to 9.4. As part of the Clery Act, institutions are required to report the number of arrests made for illegal weapons possession and drug and liquor law violations on college campuses. In contrast to the decreases in reported on-campus crimes, the total number of arrests for illegal weapons possession and drug and liquor law violations increased from 40,300 in 2001 to 51,400 in 2012, although the 2012 figure was down from 54,400 in 2011 (table 22.1 and figure 22.2). While the number of arrests for weapons possession was 4 percent lower in 2012 than in 2001 (1,000 vs. 1,100), there were increases over the period in the larger categories of arrests for drug and liquor law violations. Arrests for drug law violations increased by 76 percent during this period, reaching 20,800, and arrests for liquor law violations rose by 8 percent, reaching 29,500. Some of the increases in arrests may be associated with increases in student enrollment during this period. The number of arrests for drug law violations per 10,000 students increased from 10.2 to 13.7 (table 22.2); however, the number of arrests per 10,000 students for liquor law violations was lower in 2012 (19.4) than in 2001 (23.5). There were some differences among institution types in the patterns of on-campus arrests made for illegal weapons possession and drug and liquor law violations. At public 4-year institutions, the number of on-campus arrests per 10,000 students was higher in 2012 than in 2001 (62.5 vs. 60.1). In contrast, there was a decrease in the number of on-campus arrests per 10,000 students at nonprofit 4-year institutions (from 24.5 to 16.8). The number of oncampus arrests per 10,000 students at public 2-year institutions in 2012 was 8.7, which was higher than in 2001 (7.8) but lower than in 2006 (10.9). In addition to reporting on-campus arrests, institutions report referrals for disciplinary action for cases involving illegal weapons possession, drug law violations, and liquor law violations. Disciplinary action counts only include incidents for which there was a referral for institutional disciplinary action, but no arrest. In 2012, there were 248,900 referrals for disciplinary action for cases involving weapons, drugs, and liquor law violations, with most of the referrals (90 percent) involving violations in residence halls. The largest number of disciplinary referrals (193,500) involved liquor law violations (table 22.1). Indicator 22 continued on page 100.  2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009  Similar to the number of on-campus arrests for drug and liquor law violations, the number of disciplinary referrals for these incidents has increased. The number of referrals for drug law violations rose by 126 percent, from 23,900 in 2001 to 54,000 in 2012 (figure 22.3). The number of referrals for liquor law violations rose by 49 percent, from 130,000 to 193,500. The number of referrals for illegal weapons possession was lower in 2012 (1,400) than in 2006 (1,900), but it was slightly higher than the number of such referrals in 2001 (1,300). Some of these increases may be associated with there being more students on college campuses; however, there were also increases in the number of disciplinary actions per 10,000 students, as the number of disciplinary actions rose faster than enrollment. The number of referrals for drug law violations increased from 20.5 per 10,000 students in 2001 to 35.6 per 10,000 students in 2012 (table 22.2). Also, the number of referrals for liquor law violations per 10,000 students was higher in 2012 (127.4) than in 2001 (111.3). In contrast, the number of referrals per 10,000 students for illegal weapons possession was lower in 2012 (0.9) than in 2001 (1.1). Both public 4-year and nonprofit 4-year institutions had increases in disciplinary referrals between 2001 and 2012. At public 4-year institutions, the number of referrals for disciplinary action involving illegal weapons, drug law violations, and liquor law violations increased from 153.1 per 10,000 students in 2001 to 192.2 in 2012. At nonprofit 4-year institutions, the number of referrals for these types of incidents rose from 275.5 per 10,000 students to 334.3 per 10,000 students. In both 2001 and 2011, more than threequarters of these referrals for disciplinary action at public 4-year and nonprofit 4-year institutions were for liquor law violations.  Indicator 23 continued on page 104. In 2012, there were 791 criminal incidents classified as hate crimes that occurred on the campuses of public and private 2-year and 4-year postsecondary institutions which were reported to police and security agencies (table 23.1). The most common type of hate crime reported by institutions was destruction, damage, and vandalism (412 incidents), followed by intimidation (261 incidents), simple assault (79 incidents), aggravated assault (14 incidents), larceny (11 incidents), robbery (5 incidents), burglary (5 incidents), and forcible sex offenses (4 incidents). For several other types of on-campus crimesnamely, murder, negligent manslaughter, non-forcible sex offenses, motor vehicle theft, and arson-there were no incidents classified as hate crimes.  1 Willfully or maliciously destroying, damaging, defacing, or otherwise injuring real or personal property without the consent of the owner or the person having custody or control of it. 2 Placing another person in reasonable fear of bodily harm through the use of threatening words and/or other conduct, but without displaying a weapon or subjecting the victim to actual physical attack. 3 A physical attack by one person upon another where neither the offender displays a weapon, nor the victim suffers obvious severe or aggravated bodily injury involving apparent broken bones, loss of teeth, possible internal injury, severe laceration, or loss of consciousness. 4 Attack upon a person for the purpose of inflicting severe or aggravated bodily injury. 5 The unlawful taking, carrying, leading, or riding away of property from the possession of another. 6 Taking or attempting to take anything of value using actual or threatened force or violence. 7 Unlawful entry of a structure to commit a felony or theft. 8 Any sexual act directed against another person forcibly and/or against that person's will. NOTE: Data are for degree-granting institutions, which are institutions that grant associate's or higher degrees and participate in Title IV federal financial aid programs. Some institutions that report Clery Act data-specifically, non-degree-granting institutions and institutions outside of the 50 states and the District of Columbia-are excluded. A hate crime is a criminal offense that is motivated, in whole or in part, by the perpetrator's bias against a group of people based on their race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender, or disability. Includes on-campus incidents involving students, staff, and on-campus guests. Excludes off-campus crimes and arrests even if they involve college students or staff.

Similar frequencies of bias were associated with vandalism, intimidation, and simple assault in 2011. Race was the category of bias most frequently associated with the three most common hate crimes: 46 percent of vandalisms, 39 percent of intimidations, and 33 percent of simple assaults. Also similar to 2012, sexual orientation was the second most frequently reported category of bias for these three types of hate crimes in 2011: 28 percent of vandalisms, 32 percent of intimidations, and 24 percent of simple assaults. Aggravated assault was the fourth most commonly reported hate crime in both 2011 and 2012. In 2012, out of the 14 total aggravated assaults reported, most crimes were associated with race (6 incidents; 43 percent), followed by sexual orientation (5 incidents; 36 percent) and religion, gender, and disability (1 incident each; 7 percent each). While the number of hate crimes reported in 2012 was highest at 4-year public and 4-year private nonprofit postsecondary institutions (334 and 300 total incidents, respectively), these institutions also enroll the largest numbers of students. Public 2-year institutions, which also enroll a large number of students, had the third highest number of reported hate crimes (137 incidents). The frequency of crimes and the most commonly reported categories of bias were similar across all types of postsecondary institutions.  1 A school-associated violent death is defined as \"a homicide, suicide, or legal intervention (involving a law enforcement officer), in which the fatal injury occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school in the United States,\" while the victim was on the way to or from regular sessions at school, or while the victim was attending or traveling to or from an official school-sponsored event. 2 \"At school\" includes on school property, on the way to or from regular sessions at school, and while attending or traveling to or from a school-sponsored event.

SOURCE: U.S.   SAVD uses a four-step process to identify and collect data on school-associated violent deaths. Cases are initially identified through a search of the LexisNexis newspaper and media database. Then law enforcement officials are contacted to confirm the details of the case and to determine if the event meets the case definition. Once a case is confirmed, a law enforcement official and a school official are interviewed regarding details about the school, event, victim(s), and offender(s). A copy of the full law enforcement report is also sought for each case. The information obtained on schools includes school demographics, attendance/absentee rates, suspensions/expulsions and mobility, school history of weapon-carrying incidents, security measures, violence prevention activities, school response to the event, and school policies about weapon carrying. Event information includes the location of injury, the context of injury (while classes were being held, during break, etc.), motives for injury, method of injury, and school and community events happening around the time period. Information obtained on victim(s) and offender(s) includes demographics, circumstances of the event (date/time, alcohol or drug use, number of persons involved), types and origins of weapons, criminal history, psychological risk factors, school-related problems, extracurricular activities, and family history, including structure and stressors. One hundred and five school-associated violent deaths were identified from July 1, 1992, to June 30, 1994(Kachur et al. 1996. A more recent report from this data collection identified 253 school-associated violent deaths between July 1, 1994, and June 30, 1999(Anderson et al. 2001. Other publications from this study have described how the number of events change during the school year (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2001), the source of the firearms used in these events (Reza et al. 2003), and suicides that were associated with schools (Kauffman et al. 2004). The most recent publication describes trends in school-associated homicide from July 1, 1992, to June 30, 2006(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2008. The interviews conducted on cases between July 1, 1994, and June 30, 1999, achieved a response rate of 97 percent for police officials and 78 percent for school officials. For several reasons, all data for years from 1999 to the present are flagged as preliminary. For some recent data, the interviews with school and law enforcement officials to verify case details have not been completed. The details learned during the interviews can occasionally change the classification of a case. Also, new cases may be identified because of the expansion of the scope of the media files used for case identification. Sometimes other cases not identified during earlier data years using the independent case finding efforts (which focus on nonmedia sources of information) will be discovered. Also, other cases may occasionally be identified while the law enforcement and school interviews are being conducted to verify known cases.

These reports provide incident-level information on criminal homicides, including situation type (e.g., number of victims, number of offenders, and whether offenders are known); the age, sex, and race of victims and offenders; weapon used; circumstances of the incident; and the relationship of the victim to the offender. The data are provided monthly to the FBI by local law enforcement agencies participating in the UCR program. The data include murders and nonnegligent manslaughters in the United States from January 1980 to December 2012; that is, negligent manslaughters and justifiable homicides have been eliminated from the data. Based on law enforcement agency reports, the FBI estimates that 625,919 murders (including nonnegligent manslaughters) were committed from 1980 to 2011. Agencies provided detailed information on 590,954 of these homicide victims. SHR estimates in this report have been revised from those in previously published reports. About 90 percent of homicides are included in the SHR program. However, adjustments can be made to the weights to correct for missing victim reports. Estimates from the SHR program used in this report were generated by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). The SHR data were weighted to compensate for the average annual 10 percent of homicides that were not reported to the SHR. The development of the set of annual weights is a three-step process. Each year the FBI's annual Crime in the United States report presents a national estimate of murder victims in the United States and estimates of the number of murder victims in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The first-stage weight uses the FBI's annual estimates of murder victims in each state and the number of murder victims from that state found in the annual SHR database. Specifically, the first-stage weight for victims in state S in year Y is FBI's estimate of murder victims in state S (year Y) Number of murder victims in the SHR file from state S (year Y) For complete reporting states, this first-stage weight is equal to 1. For partial reporting states, this weight is greater than 1. For states with a first-stage weight greater than 2-that is, the state reported SHR data for less than half of the FBI's estimated number of murder victims in the state-the first-stage weight is set to 1. The second-stage weight uses the FBI's annual national estimates of murder victims in the United States and the sum of the first-stage weights for each state. The second-stage weight for victims in all states in year Y is FBI estimate of murder victims in the United States (year Y) Sum of the first-stage weights of all states (year Y) NCVS estimates reported in Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2013 and beyond may differ from those in previous published reports. This is because a small number of victimizations, referred to as series victimizations, are included in this report using a new counting strategy. High-frequency repeat victimizations, or series victimizations, are six or more similar but separate victimizations that occur with such frequency that the victim is unable to recall each individual event or describe each event in detail. As part of ongoing research efforts associated with the redesign of the NCVS, BJS investigated ways to include high-frequency repeat victimizations, or series victimizations, in estimates of criminal victimization. Including series victimizations results in more accurate estimates of victimization. BJS has decided to include series victimizations using the victim's estimates of the number of times the victimization occurred over the past 6 months, capping the number of victimizations within each series at a maximum of 10. This strategy for counting series victimizations balances the desire to estimate national rates and account for the experiences of persons who have been subjected to repeat victimizations against the desire to minimize the estimation errors that can occur when repeat victimizations are reported. Including series victimizations in national rates results in rather large increases in the level of violent victimization; however, trends in violence are generally similar regardless of whether series victimizations are included. For more information on the new counting strategy and supporting research, see Methods for Counting High Frequency Repeat Victimizations in the National Crime Victimization Survey at http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/ content/pub/pdf/mchfrv.pdf. Readers should note that in 2003, in accordance with changes to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget's standards for the classification of federal data on race and ethnicity, the NCVS item on race/ ethnicity was modified. A question on Hispanic origin is now followed by a new question about race. The new question about race allows the respondent to choose more than one race and delineates Asian as a separate category from Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. An analysis conducted by the Demographic Surveys Division at the U.S. Census Bureau showed that the new race question had very little impact on the aggregate racial distribution of NCVS respondents, with one exception: There was a 1.6 percentage point decrease in the percentage of respondents who reported themselves as White. Due to changes in race/ ethnicity categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be made with caution. The number of NCVS-eligible households in the sample in 2013 was about 107,400. Households were selected using a stratified, multistage cluster design. In the first stage, the primary sampling units (PSUs), consisting of counties or groups of counties, were selected. In the second stage, smaller areas, called Enumeration Districts (EDs), were selected from each sampled PSU. Finally, from selected EDs, clusters of four households, called segments, were selected for interview. At each stage, the selection was done proportionate to population size in order to create a selfweighting sample. The final sample was augmented to account for households constructed after the decennial Census. Within each sampled household, the U.S. Census Bureau interviewer attempts to interview all household members age 12 and older to determine whether they had been victimized by the measured crimes during the 6 months preceding the interview. The first NCVS interview with a housing unit is conducted in person. Subsequent interviews are conducted by telephone, if possible. About 80,000 persons age 12 and older are interviewed every 6 months. Households remain in the sample for 3 years and are interviewed seven times at 6-month intervals. Since the survey's inception, the initial interview at each sample unit has been used only to bound future interviews to establish a time frame to avoid duplication of crimes uncovered in these subsequent interviews. Beginning in 2006, data from the initial interview have been adjusted to account for the effects of bounding and have been included in the survey estimates. After a household has been interviewed its seventh time, it is replaced by a new sample household. In 2013, the household response rate was about 84 percent, and the completion rate for persons within households was about 88 percent. Weights were developed to permit estimates for the There were changes in the sample design and survey methodology in the 2006 National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) that may have affected survey estimates. Caution should be used when comparing 2006 estimates to estimates of other years. Data from 2007 onward are comparable to earlier years. Analyses of the 2007 estimates indicate that the program changes made in 2006 had relatively small effects on NCVS estimates. For more information on the 2006 NCVS data, see Criminal Victimization, 2006 at http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv06. pdf, the technical notes at http://www.bjs.gov/content/ pub/pdf/cv06tn.pdf, and Criminal Victimization, 2007 at http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv07.pdf. response rate of less than 85 percent be evaluated for the potential magnitude of unit nonresponse bias before the data or any analysis using the data may be released (U.S. Department of Education 2003). Due to the low unit response rate in 2005,2007,2009,2011, and 2013, a unit nonresponse bias analysis was done. Unit response rates indicate how many sampled units have completed interviews. Because interviews with students could only be completed after households had responded to the NCVS, the unit completion rate for the SCS reflects both the household interview completion rate and the student interview completion rate. Nonresponse can greatly affect the strength and application of survey data by leading to an increase in variance as a result of a reduction in the actual size of the sample and can produce bias if the nonrespondents have characteristics of interest that are different from the respondents. In order for response bias to occur, respondents must have different response rates and responses to particular survey variables. The magnitude of unit nonresponse bias is determined by the response rate and the differences between respondents and nonrespondents on key survey variables. Although the bias analysis cannot measure response bias since the SCS is a sample survey and it is not known how the population would have responded, the SCS sampling frame has four key student or school characteristic variables for which data are known for respondents and nonrespondents: sex, race/ethnicity, household income, and urbanicity, all of which are associated with student victimization. To the extent that there are differential responses by respondents in these groups, nonresponse bias is a concern. In 2005, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of bias for the race, household income, and urbanicity variables. White (non-Hispanic) and Other (non-Hispanic) respondents had higher response rates than Black (non-Hispanic) and Hispanic respondents. Respondents from households with an income of $35,000-$49,999 and $50,000 or more had higher response rates than those from households with incomes of less than $7,500, $7,500-$14,999, $15,000-$24,999 and $25,000-$34,999. Respondents who live in urban areas had lower response rates than those who live in rural or suburban areas. Although the extent of nonresponse bias cannot be determined, weighting adjustments, which corrected for differential response rates, should have reduced the problem. In 2007, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of bias by the race/ethnicity and household income variables. Hispanic respondents had lower response rates than other races/ethnicities. Respondents from households with an income of $25,000 or more had higher response rates than those from households with incomes of less than $25,000. However, when responding students are compared to the eligible NCVS sample, there were no measurable differences between the responding students and the eligible students, suggesting that the nonresponse bias has little impact on the overall estimates. In 2009, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of potential bias for the race/ethnicity and urbanicity variables. White students and students of other races/ethnicities had higher response rates than did Black and Hispanic respondents. Respondents from households located in rural areas had higher response rates than those from households located in urban areas. However, when responding students are compared to the eligible NCVS sample, there were no measurable differences between the responding students and the eligible students, suggesting that the nonresponse bias has little impact on the overall estimates. In 2011, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of potential bias for the age variable. Respondents 12 to 17 years old had higher response rates than did 18-year-old respondents in the NCVS and SCS interviews. Weighting the data adjusts for unequal selection probabilities and for the effects of nonresponse. The weighting adjustments that correct for differential response rates are created by region, age, race, and sex, and should have reduced the effect of nonresponse. In 2013, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of potential bias for the age, region, and Hispanic origin variable in the NCVS interview response. Within the SCS portion of the data, only the age and region variables showed significant unit nonresponse bias. Further analysis indicated only the age 14 and the west region categories showed positive response biases that were significantly different from some of the other categories within the age and region variables. Based on the analysis, nonresponse bias seems to have little impact on the SCS results. Response rates for most SCS survey items in all survey years were high-typically over 97 percent of all eligible respondents, meaning there is little potential for item nonresponse bias for most items in the survey. Weights were developed to compensate for differential probabilities of selection and nonresponse. The weighted data permit inferences about the eligible student population who were enrolled in schools in all SCS data years.

The YRBSS focuses on priority health-risk behaviors established during youth that result in the most significant mortality, morbidity, disability, and social problems during both youth and adulthood. The YRBSS includes a national school-based Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) as well as surveys conducted in states and large urban school districts. This report uses 1993uses , 1995uses , 1997uses , 1999uses , 2001uses , 2003uses , 2005uses , 2007uses , 2009uses , 2011uses , and 2013 The national YRBS uses a three-stage cluster sampling design to produce a nationally representative sample of students in grades 9-12 in the United States. The target population consisted of all public and private school students in grades 9-12 in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The first-stage sampling frame included selecting primary sampling units (PSUs) from strata formed on the basis of urbanization and the relative percentage of Black and Hispanic students in the PSU. These PSUs are either counties; subareas of large counties; or groups of smaller, adjacent counties. At the second stage, schools were selected with probability proportional to school enrollment size. The final stage of sampling consisted of randomly selecting, in each chosen school and in each of grades 9-12, one or two classrooms from either a required subject, such as English or social studies, or a required period, such as homeroom or second period. All students in selected classes were eligible to participate. In surveys conducted before 2013, three strategies were used to oversample Black and Hispanic students: (1) larger sampling rates were used to select PSUs that are in high-Black and high-Hispanic strata; (2) a modified measure of size was used that increased the probability of selecting schools with a disproportionately high minority enrollment; and (3) two classes per grade, rather than one, were selected in schools with a high percentage of combined Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, or American Indian/Alaska Native enrollment. In 2013, only selection of two classes per grade was needed to achieve an adequate precision with minimum variance. Approximately 16,300 students participated in the 1993 survey, 10,900 students participated in the 1995 survey, 16,300 students participated in the 1997 survey, 15,300 students participated in the 1999 survey, 13,600 students participated in the 2001 survey, 15,200 students participated in the 2003 survey, 13,900 students participated in the 2005 survey, 14,000 students participated in the 2007 survey, 16,400 students participated in the 2009 survey, 15,400 participated in the 2011 survey, and 13,600 participated in the 2013 survey. The overall response rate was 70 percent for the 1993 survey, 60 percent for the 1995 survey, 69 percent for the 1997 survey, 66 percent for the 1999 survey, 63 percent for the 2001 survey, 67 percent for the 2003 survey, 67 percent for the 2005 survey, 68 percent for the 2007 survey, 71 percent for the 2009 survey, 71 percent for the 2011 survey, and 68 percent for the 2013 survey. NCES standards call for response rates of 85 percent or better for cross-sectional surveys, and bias analyses are required by NCES when that percentage is not achieved. For YRBS data, a full nonresponse bias analysis has not been done because the data necessary to do the analysis are not available. The weights were developed to adjust for nonresponse and the oversampling of Black and Hispanic students in the sample. The final weights were constructed so that only weighted proportions of students (not weighted counts of students) in each grade matched national population projections. State-level data were downloaded from the Youth Online: Comprehensive Results web page (http:// nccd.cdc.gov/YouthOnline/). Each state and district school-based YRBS employs a two-stage, cluster sample design to produce representative samples of students in grades 9-12 in their jurisdiction. All except a few state samples, and all district samples, include only public schools, and each district sample includes only schools in the funded school district (e.g., San Diego Unified School District) rather than in the entire city (e.g., greater San Diego area). In the first sampling stage in all except a few states and districts, schools are selected with probability proportional to school enrollment size. In the second sampling stage, intact classes of a required subject or intact classes during a required period (e.g., second period) are selected randomly. All students in sampled classes are eligible to participate. Certain states and districts modify these procedures to meet their individual needs. For example, in a given state or district, all schools, rather than a sample of schools, might be selected to participate. State and local surveys that have a scientifically selected sample, appropriate documentation, and an overall response rate greater than or equal to 60 percent are weighted. The overall response rate reflects the school response rate multiplied by the student response rate. These three criteria are used to ensure that the data from those surveys can be considered representative of students in grades 9-12 in that jurisdiction. A weight is applied to each record to adjust for student nonresponse and the distribution of students by grade, sex, and race/ ethnicity in each jurisdiction. Therefore, weighted estimates are representative of all students in grades 9-12 attending schools in each jurisdiction. Surveys that do not have an overall response rate of greater than or equal to 60 percent and that do not have appropriate documentation are not weighted and are not included in this report. In 2013, a total of 42 states and 21 districts had weighted data. Not all of the districts were contained in the 42 states. For example, California was not one of the 42 states that obtained weighted data but it contained several districts that did. For more information on the location of the districts, please see http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/yrbs/participation. htm. In sites with weighted data, the student sample sizes for the state and district YRBS ranged from 1,107 to 53,785. School response rates ranged from 70 to 100 percent, student response rates ranged from 60 to 94 percent, and overall response rates ranged from 60 to 87 percent. Readers should note that reports of these data published by the CDC and in this report do not include percentages where the denominator includes less than 100 unweighted cases. In 1999, in accordance with changes to the Office of Management and Budget's standards for the classification of federal data on race and ethnicity, the YRBS item on race/ethnicity was modified. The version of the race and ethnicity question used in 1993, 1995, and 1997 version used in 1999, 2001, 2003, and in the 2005, 2007, and 2009 2007,2009,2011, and 2013 surveys, race/ethnicity was computed from two questions: (1) \"Are you Hispanic or Latino?\" (response options were \"yes\" and \"no\"), and (2) \"What is your race?\" (response options were \"American Indian or Alaska Native,\" \"Asian,\" \"Black or African American,\" \"Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,\" or \"White\"). For the second question, students could select more than one response option. For this report, students were classified as \"Hispanic\" if they answered \"yes\" to the first question, regardless of how they answered the second question. Students who answered \"no\" to the first question and selected more than one race/ethnicity in the second category were classified as \"More than one race.\" Students who answered \"no\" to the first question and selected only one race/ethnicity were classified as that race/ethnicity. Race/ethnicity was classified as missing for students who did not answer the first question and for students who answered \"no\" to the first question but did not answer the second question. CDC has conducted two studies to understand the effect of changing the race/ethnicity item on the YRBS. Brener, Kann, and McManus (2003) found that allowing students to select more than one response to a single race/ethnicity question on the YRBS had only a minimal effect on reported race/ ethnicity among high school students. Eaton, Brener, Kann, and Pittman (2007) found that self-reported race/ethnicity was similar regardless of whether the single-question or a two-question format was used.

Data reported by districts, schools, principals, and teachers provide a variety of statistics on the condition of education in the United States that may be used by policy makers and the general public. The SASS system covers a wide range of topics, including teacher demand, teacher and principal characteristics, teachers' and principals' perceptions of school climate and problems in their schools, teacher and principal compensation, district hiring and retention practices, general conditions in schools, and basic characteristics of the student population. SASS data are collected through a mail questionnaire with telephone and in-person field follow-up. SASS has been conducted by the Census Bureau for NCES since the first administration of the survey, which was conducted during the 1987-88 school year. Subsequent SASS administrations were conducted in 1990-91, 1993-94, 1999-2000, 2003-04, 2007-08, and 2011-12. SASS is designed to produce national, regional, and state estimates for public elementary and secondary schools, school districts, principals, teachers, and school library media centers; and national and regional estimates for public charter schools, as well as principals, teachers, and school library media centers within these schools. For private schools, the sample supports national, regional, and affiliation estimates for schools, principals, and teachers. From its inception, SASS has had four core components: school questionnaires, teacher questionnaires, principal questionnaires, and school district (prior to 1999-2000, \"teacher demand and shortage\") questionnaires. A fifth component, school library media center questionnaires, was introduced in the 1993-94 administration and has been included in every subsequent administration of SASS. School library data were also collected in the 1990-91 administration of the survey through the school and principal questionnaires. School questionnaires used in SASS include the Public and Private School Questionnaires; teacher questionnaires include the Public and Private School Teacher Questionnaires; principal questionnaires include the Public and Private School Principal (or School Administrator) Questionnaires, and school district questionnaires include the School District (or Teacher Demand and Shortage) Questionnaires. Although the four core questionnaires and the school library media questionnaires have remained relatively stable over the various administrations of SASS, the survey has changed to accommodate emerging issues in elementary and secondary education. Some items have been added, some have been deleted, and some questionnaire items have been reworded. During the 1990-91 SASS cycle, NCES worked with the Office of Indian Education to add an Indian School Questionnaire to SASS, and it remained a part of SASS through 2007-08. The Indian School Questionnaire explores the same school-level issues that the Public and Private School Questionnaires explore, allowing comparisons among the three types of schools. The 1990The -91, 1993The -94, 1999The -2000The -04, and 2007 administrations of SASS obtained data on Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) schools (schools funded or operated by the BIE), but the 2011-12 administration did not obtain BIE data. SASS estimates for all survey years presented in this report exclude BIE schools, and as a result, estimates in this report may differ from those in previously published reports. School library media center questionnaires were administered in public, private, and BIE schools as part of the 1993-94 and 1999-2000 SASS. During the 2003-04 administration of SASS, only library media centers in public schools were surveyed, and in 2007-08 library media centers in public schools and BIE and BIE-funded schools were surveyed. The 2011-12 survey collected data only on school library media centers in traditional public schools and in public charter schools. School library questions focused on facilities, services and policies, staffing, technology, information literacy, collections and expenditures, and media equipment. New or revised topics included access to online licensed databases, resource availability, and additional elements on information literacy. The Student Records and Library Media Specialist/Librarian Questionnaires were administered only in 1993-94. As part of the 1999-2000 SASS, the Charter School Questionnaire was sent to the universe of charter schools in operation in 1998-99. In 2003-04 and in subsequent administrations of SASS, charter schools were included in the public school sample as opposed to being sent a separate questionnaire. Another change in the 2003-04 administration of SASS was a revised data collection procedure using a primary in-person contact within the school intended to reduce the field follow-up phase. The SASS teacher surveys collect information on the characteristics of teachers, such as their age, race/ ethnicity, years of teaching experience, average number of hours per week spent on teaching activities, base salary, average class size, and highest degree earned. These teacher-reported data may be combined with related information on their school's characteristics, such as school type (e.g., public traditional, public charter, Catholic, private other religious, and private nonsectarian), community type, and school enrollment size. The teacher questionnaires also ask for information on teacher opinions regarding the school and teaching environment. In 1993-94, about 53,000 public school teachers and 10,400 private school teachers were sampled. In 1999-2000, about 56,300 public school teachers, 4,400 public charter school teachers, and 10,800 private school teachers were sampled. In 2003-04, about 52,500 public school teachers and 10,000 private school teachers were sampled. In 2007-08, about 48,400 public school teachers and 8,200 private school teachers were sampled. In 2011-12, about 51,100 public school teachers and 7,100 private school teachers were sampled. Weighted overall response rates in 2011-12 were 61.8 percent for public school teachers and 50.1 percent for private school teachers. The SASS principal surveys focus on such topics as age, race/ethnicity, sex, average annual salary, years of experience, highest degree attained, perceived influence on decisions made at the school, and hours spent per week on all school activities. These data on principals can be placed in the context of other SASS data, such as the type of the principal's school (e.g., public traditional, public charter, Catholic, other religious, or nonsectarian), enrollment, and percentage of students eligible for free or reduced price lunch. In 2003-04, about 10,200 public school principals were sampled, and in 2007-08, about 9,800 public school principals were sampled. In 2011-12, about 11,000 public school principals and 3,000 private school principals were sampled. Weighted response rates in 2011-12 for public school principals and private school principals were 72.7 percent and 64.7 percent, respectively. The SASS 2011-12 sample of schools was confined to the 50 states and the District of Columbia and excludes the other jurisdictions, the Department of Defense overseas schools, the BIE schools, and schools that do not offer teacher-provided classroom instruction in grades 1-12 or the ungraded equivalent. The SASS 2011-12 sample included 10,250 traditional public schools, 750 public charter schools, and 3,000 private schools. The public school sample for the 2011-12 SASS was based on an adjusted public school universe file from the 2009-10 Common Core of Data (CCD), a database of all the nation's public school districts and public schools. The private school sample for the 2011-12 SASS was selected from the 2009-10 Private School Universe Survey (PSS), as updated for the 2011-12 PSS. This update collected membership lists from private school associations and religious denominations, as well as private school lists from state education departments. The 2011-12 SASS private school frame was further augmented by the inclusion of additional schools that were identified through the 2009-10 PSS area frame data collection. Additional resources available regarding SASS include the methodology report Quality Profile for SASS, Rounds 1-3: 1987-1995 "}, {"section_title": "School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS)", "text": "The School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS) is managed by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) on behalf of the U.S. Department of Education. SSOCS collects extensive crime and safety data from principals and school administrators of U.S. public schools. Data from this collection can be used to examine the relationship between school characteristics and violent and serious violent crimes in primary schools, middle schools, high schools, and combined schools. In addition, data from SSOCS can be used to assess what crime prevention programs, practices, and policies are used by schools. SSOCS has been conducted in school years 1999-2000, 2003-04, 2005-06, 2007-08, and 2009-10. SSOCS was developed by NCES and is funded by the Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools of the U.S. Department of Education. The 2009-10 SSOCS (SSOCS: 2010) was conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. Data collection began on February 24, 2010, when questionnaire packets were mailed to sampled schools, and continued through June 11, 2010. A total of 2,648 public schools submitted usable and referred for disciplinary action for an offense, only the arrest is counted. Arrest is defined to include persons processed by arrest, citation, or summons, including those arrested and released without formal charges being placed. Referral for disciplinary action is defined to include persons referred to any official who initiates a disciplinary action of which a record is kept and which may result in the imposition of a sanction. Referrals may or may not involve the police or other law enforcement agencies. All criminal offenses and arrests may include students, faculty, staff, and the general public. These offenses may or may not involve students that are enrolled in the institution. Referrals primarily deal with persons associated formally with the institution (i.e., students, faculty, staff). Campus security and police statistics do not necessarily reflect the total amount or even the nature of crime on campus. Rather, they reflect incidents that have been reported and recorded by campus security and/ or local police. The process of reporting and recording alleged criminal incidents involve some well-known social filters and steps beginning with the victim. First, the victim or some other party must recognize that a possible crime has occurred and report the event. The event must then be recorded, and if it is recorded, the nature and type of offense must be classified. This classification may differ from the initial report due to the collection of additional evidence, interviews with witnesses, or through officer discretion. Also, the date an incident is reported may be much later than the date of the actual incident. For example, a victim may not realize something was stolen until much later, or a victim of violence may wait a number of days to report a crime. Other factors are related to the probability that an incident is reported, including the severity of the event, the victim's confidence and prior experience with the police or security agency, or influence from third parties (e.g., friends and family knowledgeable about the incident). Finally the reader should be mindful that these figures represent alleged criminal offenses reported to campus security and/or local police within a given year, and they do not necessarily reflect prosecutions or convictions for crime.

All data in EDFacts are organized into \"data groups\" and reported to ED using defined file specifications. Depending on the data group, state education agencies may submit aggregate counts for the state as a whole or detailed counts for individual schools or school districts. EDFacts does not collect studentlevel records. The entities that are required to report EDFacts data vary by data group but may include the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Department of Defense (DoD) dependents schools, the Bureau of Indian Education, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. More information about EDFacts file specifications and data groups can be found at http:// www.ed.gov/EDFacts. EDFacts is a universe collection and is not subject to sampling error, but nonsampling errors such as nonresponse and inaccurate reporting may occur. The U.S. Department of Education attempts to minimize nonsampling errors by training data submission coordinators and reviewing the quality of state data submissions. However, anomalies may still be present in the data. Differences in state data collection systems may limit the comparability of EDFacts data across states and across time. To build EDFacts files, state education agencies rely on data that were reported by their schools and school districts. The systems used to collect these data are evolving rapidly and differ from state to state. For example, there is a large shift in California's firearm incident data between 2010-11 and 2011-12. California cited a new student data system that more accurately collects firearm incident data as the reason for the magnitude of the difference. In some cases, EDFacts data may not align with data reported on state education agency websites. States may update their websites on different schedules than those they use to report to ED. Further, ED may use methods to protect the privacy of individuals represented within the data that could be different from the methods used by an individual state. EDFacts firearm incidents data are collected in data group 601 within file 094. EDFacts collects this data group on behalf of the Office of Safe and Healthy Students in the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education. The definition for this data group is \"The number of incidents involving students who brought or possessed firearms at school.\" The reporting period is the entire school year. Data group 601 collects separate counts for incidents involving handguns, rifles/shotguns, other firearms, and multiple weapon types. The counts reported here exclude the \"other firearms\" category. For more information about this data group, please see file specification 094 for the relevant school year, available at http://www2.ed.gov/ about/inits/ed/edfacts/file-specifications.html.

Both types of error affect the estimates presented in this report. Several sources can contribute to nonsampling errors. For example, members of the population of interest are inadvertently excluded from the sampling frame; sampled members refuse to answer some of the survey questions (item nonresponse) or all of the survey questions (questionnaire nonresponse); mistakes are made during data editing, coding, or entry; the responses that respondents provide differ from the \"true\" responses; or measurement instruments such as tests or questionnaires fail to measure the characteristics they are intended to measure. Although nonsampling errors due to questionnaire and item nonresponse can be reduced somewhat by the adjustment of sample weights and imputation procedures, correcting nonsampling errors or gauging the effects of these errors is usually difficult. Sampling errors occur because observations are made on samples rather than on entire populations. Surveys of population universes are not subject to sampling errors. Estimates based on a sample will differ somewhat from those that would have been obtained by a complete census of the relevant population using the same survey instruments, instructions, and procedures. The standard error of a statistic is a measure of the variation due to sampling; it indicates the precision of the statistic obtained in a particular sample. In addition, the standard errors for two sample statistics can be used to estimate the precision of the difference between the two statistics and to help determine whether the difference based on the sample is large enough so that it represents the population difference. Most of the data used in this report were obtained from complex sampling designs rather than a simple random design. The features of complex sampling require different techniques to calculate standard errors than are used for data collected using a simple random sampling. Therefore, calculation of standard errors requires procedures that are markedly different from the ones used when the data are from a simple random sample. The Taylor series approximation technique or the balanced repeated replication (BRR) method was used to estimate most of the statistics and their standard errors in this report. Standard error calculation for data from the School Crime Supplement was based on the Taylor series approximation method using PSU and strata variables available from each dataset. For statistics based on all years of NCVS data, standard errors were derived from a formula developed by the U.S. Census Bureau, which consists of three generalized variance function (gvf) constant parameters that represent the curve fitted to the individual standard errors calculated using the Jackknife Repeated Replication technique. The coefficient of variation (C V ) represents the ratio of the standard error to the mean. As an attribute of a distribution, the C V is an important measure of the reliability and accuracy of an estimate. With the exception of Indicator 2, the C V was calculated for all estimates in this report, and in cases where the C V was between 30 and 50 percent the estimates were noted with a ! symbol (interpret data with caution). In Indicator 2, the \"!\" symbol cautions the reader that estimates marked indicate that the reported statistic was based on fewer than 10 cases. With the exception of Indicator 2, in cases where the C V was 50 percent or greater, the estimate was determined not to meet reporting standards and was suppressed."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Procedures", "text": "The comparisons in the text have been tested for statistical significance to ensure that the differences are larger than might be expected due to sampling variation.
