As a type of dementia, it is a neurological dysfunction that is irreversible, neurodegenerative, and progressive, causing memory loss and a decline in cognitive function. AD usually occurs in older people and is considered to be a complex disease driven by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. More than 5 million Americans suffer from AD, and it is ranked as the sixth leading cause of death in the USA [1] .\nThe Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a longitudinal multisite study that started in 2004 to understand the onset, progression, and etiology of AD. One of the ADNI objectives is to identify associa-\nThe data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni. loni.usc.edu).

Neuroimaging studies such as the ADNI feature multivariate data sets, typically composed of large numbers of genotypes and phenotypes. For example, the data set in the study by Szefer et al. [3] consisted of 75,181 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes and 56 brain phenotypes derived from MRI scans.\nTo measure the association between multivariate data sets, many different correlation coefficients have been introduced. One of the most popular is the RV coefficient, which measures the linear association between two data sets by estimating the population vector correlation coefficient \u03c1 V [4] . When both data sets consist of a single variable, RV is the squared Pearson correlation coefficient and \u03c1 V is the squared population correlation coefficient.\nIn the study by Szefer et al. [3] , the RV coefficient is used to summarize the multivariate association between brain phenotypes and SNPs in AD linkage regions. The authors performed a test of the null hypothesis \u03c1 V = 0 versus the alternative hypothesis \u03c1 V > 0, and they rejected the null hypothesis. In a post hoc investigation, they decomposed the RV coefficient into contributions from each SNP and plotted the result [3; Fig. 5] . A sample contribution plot using the methods described in section 2.1 of this paper is given in Figure 1 . The plot suggests that the association between the multivariate data matrices of explanatory and response variables is driven by the 30th and 70th explanatory variables.\nIn this report we investigate the properties of the contribution plot in terms of an underlying linear model, and discuss estimation of the components of the plot when the correlation signal may be sparse. The contribution plot is applied to simulated data sets and to genetic and brain imaging data from the ADNI study."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The Contribution Plot", "text": "In this section, we define the RV coefficient and its population counterpart, the multivariate correlation coefficient \u03c1 V , following Josse and Holmes [4] . Our intended use of the RV coefficient is to investigate correlations between matrices of genetic marker genotypes and brain phenotypes, and our descriptions will be in those terms, though the methods apply in any multivariate setting. We decompose \u03c1 V into contributions from each genetic marker, and study the form of such contributions under a multivariate linear model for brain phenotypes given genomic data. Finally, we discuss shrinkage estimation of the contributions that may be useful when the correlation signal is sparse. By sparse we mean few nonzero pairwise correlations between genotypes and phenotypes.\nLet X = (X 1 , \u2026 , X p ) denote a random vector of p explanatory variables and Y = (Y 1 , \u2026 , Y q ) denote a random vector of q response variables. A measure of population correlation between X and Y [5] is\nwhere cov() denotes population covariance. The coefficient \u03c1 V may be viewed as an extension of the squared population correlation to the multivariate setting. Suppose we have n independent and identically distributed realizations of X and Y, arranged row-wise as data matrices X(n \u00d7 p) and Y(n \u00d7 q), respectively.

From equation 2, the contribution of the k-th genetic marker to the RV coefficient is proportional to\nThe notation \u0108 k reflects the fact that the contribution of genetic marker k to the RV coefficient is an estimate of a corresponding contribution to \u03c1 V (X, Y):\nThe covariances that compose C k can be derived under a linear model for the association between X and Y. Such a model is consistent with the RV coefficient measuring the linear relationship between two multidimensional data sets. In fact,\nshows that C k depends on not only the regression coefficients, but also the variance of X k and the covariances between X k and the other components of X. Some simplification of the contributions is obtained by scaling each X k by its standard deviation, so that the variance terms become one and covariances become correlations. Letting X* and Y* denote the standardized variables, the contribution of genetic marker k to \u03c1 V (X*, Y*) is\nwhere \u03b2* kl is the coefficient of the standardized X* k in the regression of the standardized Y* l on X*. Thus, genetic marker k makes a nonzero contribution to \u03c1 V (X*, Y*) if it is directly associated with one or more Y l (i.e., \u03b2 kl \u2260 0 for one or more l) or if it is correlated with one or more X k \u2032 that is/are directly associated with one or more Y l (i.e., there is a k\u2032 such that cor(X k , X k \u2032) \u2260 0 and an l such that \u03b2 k \u2032 l \u2260 0). Interestingly, a genetic marker's indirect associations with phenotypes do not play a role in determining its contribution; we return to this point in the analyses of the simulated data. We now turn to estimation of the contributions to the RV coefficient. The contribution from the k-th genetic marker is\n\u00e5 \uf043 a sum of squared sample correlations. Our studies of simulated data (section 3.1) suggest that when the correlation signal is sparse, in the sense that there are few truly non-zero correlations, and the sample size is modest compared to the number of phenotypes, sampling error in estimates of truly zero correlations can obscure the signal of the truly non-zero correlations. A solution is to raise the squared correlations to a power, \u03b1; i.e., we consider the contributions\nRaising correlations to powers larger than 2 has the effect of differentially shrinking all estimates toward zero, with estimates near zero shrunken more than those near 1. Independently, Xu et al. [7] arrived at the same modified RV coefficient in the context of testing the null hypothesis H 0 : \u03c1 V (X*, Y*) = 0 versus the alternative hypothesis\nIn their sum-of-powered-correlations test, SPC(\u03b1), they employed RV(X*, Y*|\u03b1) as a test statistic and assessed its significance with a Monte Carlo permutation test. They also suggested an adaptive test (aSPC), in which the test statistic is a minimum p value for the SPC(\u03b1) test over a grid of powers. Though testing is not the focus of this project, we make use of their minimum-p-value idea to select a power \u03b1 for the contribution plot. In particular, our contribution plot is of contributions \u0108* k (\u03b1 m ) for the power \u03b1 m that minimizes the p value of the test based on RV(X*, Y*|\u03b1), for values of \u03b1 on a grid.

The spike above the permutationbased threshold is a strong signal of a linear association that comes from SNP rs16871157 within the NEDD9 gene on chromosome 6.\nWe can further decompose the contribution of rs16871157 by brain region. The results are shown in Figure 7, where the y axis represents the individual sample correlation to the power of 8 between rs16871157 and the 56 brain regions. Comparing the two panels of the figure, we see that the correlations in the right hemisphere are stronger than those in the left hemisphere, but that the patterns of association are very similar. Overall, it appears that rs16871157 is associated with measures of cortical thickness, particularly in the temporal lobe of the brain (phenotype MeanTemp).\nScatterplots of adjusted MeanTemp and MeanLatTemp thickness by rs16871157 genotypes are shown in Figure 8 for both the left and the right hemisphere. In both hemispheres, the distribution of adjusted cortical thickness in CN subjects with the variant allele at rs16871157 is shifted towards negative values compared to the distribution in CN subjects with two copies of the wild-type allele, which is centered at zero.
