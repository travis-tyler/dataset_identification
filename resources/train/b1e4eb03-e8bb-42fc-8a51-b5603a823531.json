Over the last twenty years the racial disparity in mortality has continued to increase. The difference between the two groups was first recorded in 1981 when medical advances in breast cancer treatment dramatically increased breast cancer survivability disproportionately for White women (Brawley 471, Ries 1998). The federal Healthy People 2010 initiative established the goal of eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in six major areas, including cancer.

The essential message of this report was that the health of the individual cannot be separated from the health of the larger community and from the health of the state and the nation. The term disparities can be defined in a number of ways. The IOM study defined disparities as racial or ethnic differences in healthcare that were not due to access-related factors or clinical needs, preferences, and appropriateness of intervention (IOM 2003 p.32). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) applied a different definition of how it measures disparities for the purpose of monitoring the Healthy People 2010 objectives. The principal measure of disparity was a relative measure, the percent difference. The difference was measured from the \"best\" or most favorable group rate, which was not always the rate for White, Non-Hispanics. The CDC expressed difference measured for indicators in terms of adverse outcomes not favorable outcomes. For example, the percent of people without health insurance rather than the percent with health insurance (Keppel 20 February 2004). Last, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) used a broader definition of disparities: In the absence of consensus on the definition of disparities, this report [The National Healthcare Disparities Report] will focus on presenting the facts. Where we find variation among populations, this variation will simply be described as a \"difference.\" By allowing the data to speak for themselves, there is no implication that these differences result in adverse health outcomes or imply moral error or prejudice in any way (DHHS 2003 p.11-12). Racial disparities in healthcare can be seen on a myriad of levels including ethical, public health, justice, economic and is indicative of flaws in the overall quality of healthcare. Policymakers and healthcare providers alike must recognize that disparities exist and hamper efforts to improve social justice and national quality of life. The United States is poised to become populated by close to 50% of what is currently considered minority group members by 2050 (U.S. Bureau of the Census 2000). In 2001, African-Americans had a 33% higher risk of dying from all types of cancer than non-Hispanic, Whites. Shavers and Brown ( Figure 1) developed a framework in order to conceptualize the potential barriers to the receipt of optimal cancer treatment. The framework was constructed around structural, provider and patient related factors that can negatively influence an individuals treatment options for all types of cancer.   , which appropriated $900 million over 10 years to provide treatment for women diagnosed with cancer via the NBCCEDP. As a social equalizer, NBCCEDP has the ability to qualify indigent and otherwise uninsured women for breast cancer treatment via state administered Medicaid programs. As of 2002 was available in every state and five tribal areas except Oklahoma (CDC 2003). Another program, the Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) of 1992 sought to regulate the quality of mammography equipment, but failed to assure the accuracy of interpretation or the effectiveness of postscreening follow-up. (Bickell 2002). However, these programs do nothing to guarantee or measure the effectiveness or appropriateness of breast cancer treatment. Figure 2 presents a timeline of major health policy initiatives that sought to increase access to and monitor quality of care in breast cancer screening and treatment.  Figure 2.

Because of the later stage at which breast cancer is typically diagnosed in Black women, the five-year survival rate for Black women remains significantly lower than for White women (75% vs. 88%) (American Cancer Society 2003)."}, {"section_title": "Breast Conserving Surgery", "text": "Numerous prospective, randomized clinical trials in the United States and in Europe during the 1980's demonstrated that survival after BCS was equal to survival after mastectomy (Fisher 1989, Blichart-Toft 1988, Veronesi 1981, Sarrazin 1989, Licter 1992, Van Dongen 1992. This strong evidence led a 1990 National Institutes of Health consensus panel to determine that breast conservation treatment is an appropriate method of primary therapy for the majority of women with localized breast cancer (NIH 1992). Breast Conserving Treatment (BCT) is defined as the excision of the primary tumor and adjacent breast tissue followed by radiation therapy. Breast Conserving Treatment is not an option for every case of breast carcinoma. However, the National Cancer Data Base issued a report in 1994 that concluded that up to 75% of diagnosed cases of breast cancer can be considered localized, thus eligible for BCT (Osteen 1994). Based on the guidelines released in 1992 by an interdisciplinary group which consisted of represented the American College of Surgeons (ACoS), American College of Radiology (ACR), the College of American Pathologists (CAP), and the Society of Surgical Oncology, there are only four absolute exclusion factors against the use of Breast Conserving Therapy. The four contraindications are listed below: \u2022 Patient in the first or second trimester pregnancy \u2022 History of therapeutic irradiation to the breast region \u2022 Multiple primary tumors in separate quadrants of the breast \u2022 Extensive indeterminate or malignant-appearing calcifications throughout the breast (Winchester 1992). Considering that Black women have a significantly worse prognosis from breast   carcinoma compared to White women, even when stage at diagnosis is equivalent, it is worthwhile then to analyze racial differences in the treatment of women with early stage breast cancer as a measure of quality of care (Joslyn 2002, Roetzheim 2000. That there was no recorded difference in breast cancer survivability before 1981 led to the hypothesis in many research articles that advances in breast cancer treatment were only benefiting one segment of the population (the primarily White, upper and middle classes) leaving less adequate care for poor and minority women (Diehr 1989, Boyer-Chammard 1999, Breen 1999. Health care for medically underserved populations remains a high priority for the U.S. government. Particular interest has been paid to cancer care because it is both common and expensive, and requires a complex interaction between patients, providers and the health care system (Hewitt 1999)."}, {"section_title": "Need for the Study", "text": "Breast cancer is firmly entrenched on the national cancer research agenda because of its enormous impact on society (Jones 2002, NCI 2001.

Also, the study demonstrates the effect of other health system and patient related factors such as insurance provider and rural versus urban residence, to the appropriate use of cancer therapy in order to present an up-to-date and accurate picture of the quality of breast cancer care for women in the state of Florida."}, {"section_title": "Review of the Literature", "text": "In the 13 years since the NIH report, there continues to be an underused of BCT as a less radical alternative to mastectomy for treatment of local stage breast cancer despite increases in the detection. The average BCS rate for the United States remains very low with only 40-50% of eligible patients undergoing the less invasive procedure (Morrow 2001, Lazovich 1999. Mastectomy rather than BCS remains the primary surgical approach to treating local breast cancer in many geographic regions. Patient advocacy groups, researchers, clinicians and policymakers consistently argue that BCS plus radiation is superior for most women because it is less invasive, preserves the breast, and post-surgical psychological adjustment is less difficult (Lantz 2002). Considering that Black women have a significantly worse prognosis from breast carcinoma compared to White women, even when stage at diagnosis is equivalent, it is worthwhile then to analyze racial differences in the treatment of women with early stage breast cancer as a measure of quality of care (Joslyn 2002, Roetzheim 2000."}, {"section_title": "Use of Breast Conserving Surgery", "text": "Overall studies of breast cancer surgery using race/ethnicity as a predictive variable have produced conflicting results. Several studies from the 1990's reported that breast cancer treatment differed between African-American women and White women but there is wide variation among researchers as to the perceived cause of the difference. National data from the early 1990's show that Black women were less likely to undergo BCS than white women (Muss 1992). Nattinger and associates and Johantgen and associates found that surgical treatment varied even after adjusting for breast cancer stage at diagnosis (Nattinger 1992, Johantgen 1995. More recently articles by Newman and associates and Velanovich and associates demonstrate that Black women continue to be less likely than White women to undergo BCS. However, the latter two studies focused on a limited population within the same urban area (Newman 1999, Velanovich 1999. Also, the Carolina Breast Cancer Study from 1995 through 2000 showed that fewer Black women received BCS than White women (Dunmore 2000). On the other side of the spectrum, in 2002 Joslyn released a study that analyzed SEER program data from 1988-1998 which found that Black women were slightly more likely the receive BCS than White women, but the differences were not clinically significant; however, greater than one-third of the Black women were premenopausal compared with fewer than one-fourth of White women (Joslyn 2002). Other studies showed that after adjusting for sociodemographic information that race was not a significant indicator of type of surgery used to treat breast cancer. Using data from the Although BCS had become the most common form of breast cancer surgical treatment, they found that in Florida non-whites were more likely to be treated by low volume surgeons who were more likely to perform mastectomies; whereas White women and privately insured women were more likely to receive BCS (Luther 2001). However, this study grouped all non-white cases into one category which can bias study results toward the null in that non-white Hispanic, Native American, and Asian racial and ethnic groups tend to vary widely from Black women in their cancer outcomes and sociodemographic factors (Bradley 2002). In another Florida-based breast cancer study using data from 1994, Roetzheim and associates found there was no racial differences in the use of BCS although insurance type varied greatly by race/ethnicity. Black women constituted 6.9% of the study population yet had a higher risk of being covered by Medicaid (6.6% for Black v. 1.8% for White women) or to be uninsured (10.0% for Non-White women v. 3.6% for White women) (Roetzheim 2000)."}, {"section_title": "Use of Radiation Therapy", "text": "Similar to the divergent findings for the use of breast conserving surgery, research conducted on the use of radiation therapy has produced equivocal results.  (Joslyn 2002). Additionally, there are access issues created by distance to radiation facilities that may serve as barriers to appropriate use of radiation therapy for post-breast conserving surgery cases. The availability of transportation and the relative convenience of such facilities may also account for slower rates of adoption of breast conserving therapy versus modified radical mastectomy for early stage breast cancer (Nattinger 2001). Nattinger's study found that women living more than 15 miles from a hospital with a radiotherapy center had a significantly reduced likelihood of undergoing BCT (OR .52, CI 0.46-0.58). Parviz and associates used geocoding software to examine the effect of distance from home to therapy site on initial surgical treatment and found that there was no statistically significant difference in BCT rates when looking at distance as a 13 continuous variable. However, statistical significance existed when cases were categorized dichotomously based on greater than or less than 40 miles from the radiation therapy center. Weaknesses of the Parviz study include that it was conducted on a small sample size treated by the same team of surgeons at the same teaching facility (Parviz 2003). In a U.S. wide study conducted in 2002, Gilligan found that there was greater use of breast conserving surgery and radiation therapy in urban areas compared to rural areas (Gilligan 2002)."}, {"section_title": "Study Contribution to the Literature", "text": "The state of Florida presents itself as the ideal setting in which to undertake this study. Florida has the highest crude incidence rate of cancer in the nation with a 14,000,000 population residing in 67 counties. Two hundred forty-seven hospitals report over 120,000 cases annually, which when unduplicated, translate into approximately 80,000 newly diagnosed cases per year (FCDS 2003 This study will contribute to the vast body of breast cancer research by providing an up-to-date picture of the breast cancer treatment differences or lack of differences between Black and White women in Florida for both surgical options and the appropriate use of radiation therapy post-breast conserving surgery. Also, this study will differ from other studies by adjusting for and evaluating the influence of rural versus urban residence in the use of surgical option and radiation therapy by employing the new continuum developed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA 2003)."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "Limitations are factors outside of the researcher's control that can affect the outcome of the study. Several limitations exist within this study design. The choice to conduct secondary data analysis is beneficial in many ways (economic cost, scope of sample size) but can hinder a researcher in terms of limiting the ability to select variables to be included in multivariate modeling. There is a necessary gap between the type of data the researcher would like to collect for inclusion in the study and the information that is available in the pre-existing dataset (Iezzoni 2003, Nachmias & Nachmias 1998. Additionally, the use of the Florida Cancer Data System tumor registry information inherently imposes several limitations. The registry only includes cancer cases treated within Florida and may limit the generalizability of findings to other states or regions of the country. When using a coded data source the issue of reliability revolves around how accurately and completely the coded information from the medical records was abstracted. Last, the validity of using cancer registry data for evaluating quality of cancer care has not been well studied. Malin and associates compared medical records, the \"gold standard,\" to California Cancer Registry data and found that the validity of registry data varied across the settings of care. As cancer care moved from the in-patient setting the capture of data decreased as follows: surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and hormonal therapy. Thus, although registry data may be valid for use in studying surgery and radiation therapy, it is not equally valid for studying the use of chemotherapy and the 15 prescription of adjuvant therapy (like Tamoxifen) which are more likely to take place in an ambulatory setting or physician's office (Malin 2002). identifying information will be used in the conduct of this study."}, {"section_title": "Hypotheses", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Approach", "text": "First univariate analysis describing the characteristics of the population was conducted. This included unadjusted mean values of continuous variables and frequency analysis of categorical variables. The results of the univariate analysis are given in tables in the Results chapter. Next, bivariate analysis was conducted to describe the relationship between the predictor variable of interest, Race, and each of the covariates. Next, two separate, multivariate logistic regression models were developed. Logistic regression is typically used to model dichotomous dependent variables and performs well when compared to more complex modeling approaches (Feinstein, Wells and Walter 1990, Selker 1995, Iezzoni 2003). The first model dealt with the outcome/dependent variable of type of surgery and race, and the second model evaluated the recommended use of radiation therapy and race. A description of the variables used in the study is provided below. In developing the models an iterative process of determining which of the covariates are useful to the explanation of the dependent variable was followed. Model fit statistics were used and interaction terms were evaluated for inclusion. All models were developed first to determine unadjusted odds ratios and, next, refined to determine adjusted odds ratios. Also, to remain consistent with the literature, the conventional, nominal levels for alpha, p-value less than or equal to 0.05, and ninety-five percent confidence intervals were developed in order to determine statistical significance of study results. These results are presented in the next chapter using a variety of tables.

Additional inclusion and exclusion criteria are detailed below. Gender. Men and women differ chromosomally, anatomically, physiologically, hormonally and reproductively. Socioeconomic circumstances influence the lives of the two genders differently (Iezzoni 2003). Breast cancer is 100 times more likely to occur in women than in men, yet each year in the United States about 400 men die of breast cancer (0.22 percent of all cancer deaths). Because of the small size of men's breasts and location of the primary tumor is most frequently in the center of the breast, modified radical and radical mastectomy are the most common surgical options for men. Because of the differences in surgical treatment (outcome variable) and because male breast cancer is a rare disease, men are excluded from the study (Elk 2003). Additionally, subjects coded as \"Intersexed,\" \"Transgendered\" or \"Unknown\" are also excluded from the sample. Thus, only subjects coded as \"Female\" will be included in the data set to be analyzed for the study. Stage of disease. The disease to be studied exclusively in this study is breast cancer. The initial data set to be examined will be all breast cancer cases within the FCDS for 2001 (coded as C50.0-C50.9). Iezzoni writes that research targeting one particular disease will not need to adjust for the presence of the disease but rather for the disease specific severity (Iezzoni 2003). Recent long-term randomized clinical trials have reaffirmed that breast conserving surgery is appropriate for women with local stage breast cancer (Fisher 1995, Veronesi 1995. Rather than recording American Joint Commission on Cancer staging information, the FCDS reports SEER Summary Stage information listed in Table 1.  (FCDS-DAM 2003). For the purpose of answering Hypotheses #1 and #2, only women with Local stage breast cancer, which includes lymph node-negative findings will be included in the analysis (Farrow 1992, Roetzheim 2000, Richardson 2004."}, {"section_title": "Missing Values", "text": "Cases with missing variables will not be included in analysis because such missing variables may produce biased results. This common approach for dealing with subject records in a data file that are incomplete is called complete-subject analysis. However, there is the potential to lose statistical power should a significant number of any variable be missing from the data set or be more likely to be missing from one category. Thus, there may be the need to re-evaluate the inclusion of cases with missing information (Rothman 1998). If there are differences in the pattern of missing variables, Tabachnick and Fidell recommend five methods of dealing with the variables: 1) delete the cases or variable; 2) estimate the missing data using a mean value; 3) use a missing data correlation matrix; 4) treat missing data as data; and 5) repeat analyses with and without missing data (Tabachnick 1989 Appendix H 2003). The surgical codes are divided into two possible groups (0/1) as previously described. Although the FCDS includes categories for \"No Surgery,\" \"Surgery, Not Otherwise Specified,\" and \"Unknown,\" cases with those entries in the Primary Surgery Summary field of the database will be excluded from this study. Radiation Therapy. Radiation Therapy will be collapsed into a dichotomous variable. The FCDS defines Radiation Therapy as listed below in Table 2. For the purpose of this study radiation will be broken down into two categories: No radiation (consisting of code 0) and any type of radiation received or planned (Codes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8). Subjects whose radiation treatment status is unknown (codes 7 and 9) will not be included in the analysis (Bradley 2002)."}, {"section_title": "Predictor Variable of Interest", "text": "Race. Race will be defined as a dichotomous, categorical variable with the case's race being defined as White or Black. Other racial/ethnic groups such as Asian, Native American and Hispanic are excluded from this study because they vary widely in their cancer outcomes, and combining such disparate groups into the study can lead to biased results (Bradley 2001). A broad-based population outcomes study by Studnicki, et al., set in one county in Florida concluded that there are research constraints in the limited number of ethnically identified indicators and, especially for Hispanics, problems in the accuracy and consistency of the assignment to racial categories and subsequent reporting (Studnicki 2004). Also, subjects who are self-identified as \"Multiracial\" in the FCDS data set will be excluded from the study.  (Elk 2003). In the study of breast cancer disparities age plays a significant role because black women younger than 40 have slightly higher rates of breast cancer diagnosis than white women in the same age group (Elk 2003)."}, {"section_title": "Covariates", "text": "Age by itself is a continuous variable and in the descriptive analysis of the data will at first be evaluated as such using univariate analysis; however, for the purpose of responding to the hypotheses, Age will become a categorical variable, stratified into four age groups depending on age at time of diagnosis. Subjects with missing or incomplete age will be categorized as \"Unknown\" and excluded from the study. Because of findings by Farrow and Ballard-Barbash that stress age as an indicator for declining use of radio therapy post-breast conserving surgery, age as a variable will be evaluated categorically to best present the difference across strata (Farrow 1992, Ballard-Barbash 1996. The subjects will be categorized into the following groups as listed in Table 3. Using ten-year age groups produces a large number of categories so that the observations are stretched over too many categories and patterns may not be easily discerned in the resulting cross tabulation. For the later, 65+ age group (used in studies that relate pre-, during and post-menopausal status to breast cancer), Rothman says that a category with \"no upper limit allows for a considerable range of variability within which the desired homogeneity of exposure or risk may not be achieved\" (206). Thus, the creation of the 80+ group will bring to light the experience of the increasing number of \"oldest old.\" One study shows that although elderly cancer patients often receive less aggressive treatment, they spend more time discussing limitations of treatments with their physicians (Iezzoni 2003, Rose 2000. Payer. Primary payer of health care for breast cancer treatment is considered an imported independent variable by many researchers. In the case of BCS versus Primary payer is a categorical variable. The FCDS database includes a multitude of categories which will be divided into five categories as shown in Table 4. because previous studies have found that women in these groups share numerous demographic characteristics as privately insured women. These characteristics include age, race, and stage at diagnosis (Richardson 2004). Rurality. The FCDS includes the case's county of residence and zip code of residence at the time of diagnosis. Luther and Studnicki found that residing in a rural rather than an urban area was significantly associated with the use of mastectomy over BCS (Luther 2001). As shown in the review of the literature section, studies by Nattinger and Parviz have evaluated the effect of rurality in terms of distance to a treatment center for radiation therapy (Nattinger 2001, Parviz 2003. The rurality measure to be employed in this project is adapted from the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural-Urban Continuum Codes which were produced by the Economic Research Service. The application of a continuum rather than a dichotomous break down of Urban versus Rural will enable isomorphic comparisons across categories. All nine of the categories of rural-urban do not apply to the state of Florida. Some adaptation of the Rural-Urban Continuum codes is necessary in order to maintain the statistical power of this study. One area that was changed was a collapsing of the last two categories that apply to Florida because of small sample size within the last stratum (Levels 6 and 8).

The USDA codes as they apply to Florida's sixty-seven counties are listed in Table 6. In order to create a more parsimonious measure of rurality and to increase the statistical power of the categories during analysis, it becomes necessary to further group the counties in Florida into the following categories described in Table 7. Cases that fall into the Unknown category are excluded from further study because they fail to contribute to the overall picture of disparities in breast cancer surgical treatment and radiation therapy use in the state of Florida. Marital status. Although much has been written on the impact of marital status on the increased use of breast cancer screening and stage of diagnosis (Miller 2002, Mandelblatt 1991, Suarez 1994, Roetzheim 1999, little has been written on the effects of marital status and the appropriate use of breast conserving surgery and radiation therapy. Marital status is used to represent a degree of social support available to the case. This project will evaluate the impact of marital status on the dependent variables. Information in the FCDS provides for four possible categories as described in Table 8.  -Nachmias 1996). Respondents who are \"living together\" with an opposite sex or same sex partner or an elderly parent who lives with an adult child do not fit accurately into this scheme, yet might exhibit the same level of social support as subjects in the \"Married\" category."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Overview", "text": "This chapter presents the results of the data analysis conducted for the study.

First, the univariate analysis presents descriptive statistics for the entire population. Next, the bivariate analysis shows the relationship between the predictor variable of interest, Race, when evaluated according to each of the covariates. Next information is presented about the iterative processes for determining which of the covariates are most useful in the explanation of the dependent variable, BCS use, and the unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (OR's) are given as well as the 95% Confidence Intervals.

The process is illustrated in Figure 2. Each record in the FCDS dataset represents one tumor. The data reduction process began by identifying tumors exclusively identified as being breast cancer (C50.0-C50.9), which consisted of 20,969 tumors (Box A). Next, 172 tumor records were removed because of a gender identity other than female, leaving 20,797 (Box B). There were no tumors occurring in the same person that were coded as female in one record and some other gender in another record. With respect to ethnicity, there were 2,393 tumors identified as belonging to Hispanics, and they were removed (Box C), leaving 18,404. Next, there were 283 tumors identified as belonging to individuals with a race other than Black or White, and they were removed, leaving 18,121 (Box D). Seven (7) tumors were removed for discrepant race entries (i.e., tumors on the same person reported the person as Black in one record, and White in another), leaving 18,114 (Box E). To limit tumors to those with local state breast cancer, 9,238 were removed, leaving 8,876 (Box F). Those coded as not falling into either the BCS or Mastectomy group were removed (n=217), leaving 8,659 (Box G). In the case of multiple tumor surgeries for the same individual coded for BCS and Mastectomy, the BCS records were removed (n=117), as Mastectomy would be the most definitive surgical option. This exclusion left 8,542 tumors (Box H). With respect to Radiation Therapy (RT), when there were multiple tumors on the same patient, only the most recent record would theoretically report RT because as the individual moved through the continuum of cancer care, Radiation Therapy would be among the last steps registered in the FCDS. In this case, tumors reporting treatment with RT were kept, and the others removed (n=510), leaving 8,032 (Box J). In the case multiple tumor records for the same individual reporting a different age for the individual, the row with the earliest age of diagnosis was retained (n = 8,017, Box K), and the rest removed (n=15). To conduct the planned analysis, it was necessary to reduce the data set to one tumor per person. To accomplish this, tumors on individuals who still had more than one tumor represented in the data set were evaluated for missing data. Those with the most missing data were removed (n=53), and 7,964 records were retained (Box L). As the planned analysis involved an evaluation of the impact of insurance type, those with multiple tumors reporting inconsistent insurance were removed (n=81), leaving 7,883 (Box M). Finally, for those individuals still representing multiple tumors in the data set, tumors were randomly removed (n=487) so that each individual contributed 1 tumor to the data set (n=7,396, Box N). Because the analysis is limited to individuals in Florida, individuals coded as outside the state were removed (n=217), leaving a final data set of 7,179 individuals representing one tumor each (Box P).  and 423 (6%) in Non Metro.   visually presents the variation between Black and White cases in a series of histograms for each of the covariates.      In order to better explain the relationship between the covariates and the outcome, Breast Conserving Surgery, all covariates were included in an iterative process of testing for interaction terms. None of the attempts proved to be statistically significant. The results of the modeling process can be seen in Appendix C.    Table 17 summarizes the univariate descriptive information for the study population who had breast conserving surgery and were otherwise eligible for inclusion in the study based on the previously discussed criteria. The total number of cases included in this portion of the study was 4,763. All of these cases underwent breast conserving surgery for treatment of localized breast cancer. Of those cases, 43 percent (2,066) had radiation therapy, 56 percent (2,678) reported no radiation therapy, and 3 percent (19) were unknown for radiation therapy status. Cases reporting unknown status will be excluded from further portions of this study. The same table shows the exact numbers and proportions of women in the total population for each covariate further stratified by the outcome variable. The racial distribution shows that Black cases constituted 6 percent of the BCS population (286 Black v. 4,477 White). For Age groups, each age category continues to increase with the exception of the Very Old category. Table 17 also shows the mean age 64.98 and standard deviation, 13.24 years, for the population included in this analysis. The age range for the study was 21-100 years.   Unknown. In the initial version of the USDA Rural-Urban Continuum 2,784 (58%) of the population lived in a Metro area larger than 1 million people; 1,480 (31%) lived in a Metro area with 250K-1 million people; 258 (5 %) lived in a Metro area with less than 250K. For Non Metro populations, 164 (3%) lived in a Non Metro area with greater than or equal to 20K; 65 cases (1 %) lived in Non Metro areas with between 2.5-20,000; 9 cases of were in areas with less than 2,500 and 3 cases fell into the Unknown/Out of State category and were eliminated from further analysis. The Collapsed Rural-Urban categorical breakdown used in analysis is as follows: 2,784 (58%) in Metro areas; 1,738 (36%) in Small Metro areas; and 238 (5%) in Non Metro. In terms of Radiation Therapy Use, which is the Outcome variable for this hypothesis, Table 17 shows that of the 4,763 total cases, 2,066 (43%) had \"Yes\" for Radiation Therapy in the FCDS data set and 2,678 (56%) had \"No\" for Radiation Therapy. There were 19 cases (0%) that were Unknown for Radiation Therapy Use and were excluded from further statistical analysis. Descriptive Statistics, Bivariate. Table 18 provides a more in-depth overview of the breast conserving surgery population in the study by detailing the number of cases and the appropriate percentages when evaluating the relationship between the predictor variable of interest, Race, according to each of the covariates. White cases constituted 4,477 of the total 4,763 cases used in this portion of the study, or 94 percent. There were with 81 and 80 cases respectively or an even 28% of the population for each category. There was no statistical significance in terms of placement in the Young age category between Black and White cases (OR: 2.39, 95% CI: 1.9808-3.0282). Table 19 presents a more detailed look at differences in Race according to Age.          (Morrow 2003). A better measure of quality of care, however difficult to obtain, might be to study the degree to which women are being fully informed of their surgical treatment options and the degree to which they are involved in the treatment decision-making process."}, {"section_title": "Radiation Therapy Hypothesis", "text": "Hypothesis Two asked if Black women in Florida were statistically significantly less likely than White women to receive radiation therapy after breast conserving surgery. Based on results presented in the previous chapter, again the answer is no. The results of statistical analysis of the relationship between Black and Radiation Therapy use are not significant. The Odds Ratio is 0.9170 and the 95% Confidence Interval has a range of 0.7190-1.170. Consistent with the literature, age, insurance status, rural residence and marital status were significant contributors in the explanation of radiation therapy use. There were differences between the Black and White categories. When all contributory covariates were included in modeling, Black race alone was not necessary as an explanatory variable in the outcome, receipt of Radiation Therapy. However, the true number of post-breast conserving surgery cases that actually received radiation therapy remains unknown. As Shavers, Richardson and Button reported, there is a drop-off in reporting of cancer care across the continuum of treatment such that in this study only 43% of cases received radiation therapy. Du reported that SEER data under recorded radiation therapy use by 26% (Du 1999). According to FCDS statistical analyst and data base manager, Jackie Button, all Radiation Therapy that is recorded is listed under one facility number, usually that of the hospital (Button 2004). Additionally, radiation treatment facilities are listed by the Florida Cancer Data System in a separate Facility Layout that does not match to the Cancer File Layout. Thus, not only is there no mandatory reporting of radiation therapy receipt, in the event that treatment is recorded it has no match to patient records, making impossible the ability to geocode or to otherwise calculate distance from residence of the patient to treatment facility. Our findings are consistent with the literature, Black women on Medicaid were more likely to receive radiation therapy than those women not insured by Medicaid (Bradley 2002). In order to determine if the statistically significant interaction term between Black and Medicaid for receipt of radiation therapy post-breast conserving surgery was an artifact of the manner in which data is collected, a separate analysis was run that compared Metro to a collapsed Small Metro and Non Metro populations. There was no statistically significant difference in the results, which reaffirms that Black women on Medicaid have the highest rate of radiation therapy use."}, {"section_title": "Implications and Recommendations", "text": "While this study adds to the knowledge of the relationship between race and breast conserving surgery and radiation therapy use for localized breast cancer, a number of limitations should be acknowledged. Consistent with most of the studies in the literature, this study presented analysis based on observational rather than experimental data. The use of the FCDS dataset made it impossible to fully account for differences in patient characteristics that may have effected selection into the various categories of covariates. Another of the usual limitations is geographic scope which may be acceptable because the region covered is large in elderly population size and important with respect to the evolution of geriatric health care. Last, co-morbidity data that may have been counter indications to the use of breast conserving surgery and radiation therapy were absent so that an unknown number of patients may have been otherwise ineligible for inclusion in the study. An impressive array of organizations fund Breast Cancer research on a myriad of levels. On the national level the leader is the National Cancer Institute followed by the With breast cancer firmly entrenched on the national research agenda, the policies that enable poor and underserved women to access screening and treatment should be subjected to further research so that further policy recommendations can be made based on Aday's principles of effectiveness, efficiency and equity (Aday 2004). Should the NBCCEDP be successfully evaluated as achieving its healthcare system objective, then further policy ideas could be generated to expand screening and treatment services to other diseases such as colon cancer or prostate cancer. Although those policy recommendations may not be received or acted upon immediately, the ideas could circulate as research generated alternatives in Kingdon's policy primeval soup where in they can await the confluence of the streams and the opening of a policy window . However, in the absence of further health services research pertaining to the expected percentages of appropriate use of breast conserving surgery and radiation therapy, it would be unwise to dictate a policy standard such as a HEDIS measure. The findings in this study have important implications for policy makers, clinicians and researchers that call for and could aid in additional initiatives and studies to provide improved understanding of the quality of breast cancer treatment in Florida.
