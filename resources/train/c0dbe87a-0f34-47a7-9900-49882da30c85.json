It has been affecting an increasing number of aging populations and has now become a public health crisis due to no validated disease modifying treatment. Genetic factors have been widely acknowledged to play a major role in sporadic late onset AD (LOAD). Large-scale twin studies estimated the heritability of AD to be 60-80% [1] . Substantial effort has been dedicated to genome wide association studies (GWASs) in search of AD risk genes. In addition to e4 allele in APOE, many other risk variants have been discovered to be involved in AD etiology and many of them are later replicated in other studies, e.g., BIN1, CLU, CRI, PICALM, and CD33 [2] [3] [4] [5] . Despite such significant progress, our knowledge about the functions of these risk variants is still very limited. There is a big gap between genetic factors and disease manifestation. How these risk genetic variation leads to the functional impairment in the transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolic levels, and ultimately phenotypic alterations are largely unknown. Therefore, the translation of GWAS findings into targetable mechanisms related to the disease pathogenesis remains a challenge [6] .\nConverging evidence suggests a key role of cholesterol metabolism in AD. The plasma cholesterol levels in AD are found to be 10% higher than in healthy controls [7] . APOE, the top risk gene of AD, is a major regulator of cholesterol metabolism in both peripheral blood and central nervous system [8] . Many other top AD susceptibility loci identified in large scale GWASs are also involved in the cholesterol metabolism (e.g., APOC1, BIN1, CLU, PICALM, ABCA7, and SORL1) [1, 9, 10] . Bile acids (BAs), a structurally related group of metabolites derived from cholesterol, have been suggested in recent metabolic studies as potential age-related factors associated with AD [11, 12] . BAs are known to be synthesized in the liver and are further chemically modified by the gut microbiota in the distal small intestine and colon. Recent studies in animal models suggest a role for gut microbiome in motor deficit, neuroinflammation [13, 14] , cortical beta-amyloid plaque and AD pathogenesis [15] . In addition, there is increasing evidence for the notion that bile acids and the proteins involved in their synthesis are also present in the brain [16] [17] [18] . The enzyme that plays a key role in bile acid synthesis, CYP27A1, was found to be expressed in the brain and leads to neurological disorders when mutated [19] . In a recent AD study, Nho et. al. found altered bile acid levels in mild cognitive impairment and AD patients [9] . While all of studies suggest potential connections between genetic and bile acid markers, the functional mechanism through which the genetic factors exert effect on the downstream bile acids and ultimately the brain phenotypes is less explored.\nIn this paper, we hypothesize the cascade of effect of genetic variation on gene expression levels, bile acids concentration, and ultimately brain imaging phenotypes during the development of AD.\nIntegrating genomic and metabolomic data with heterogeneous biological networks, our analysis is focused on the genes directly interacting with AD-altered bile acids and their functional regulators. We examined the additive and epistasis effects of all the SNPs located in those candidate genes on AD-related brain imaging phenotypes and identified 85 AD risk SNPs, where some genes are differentially expressed in AD compared to cognitively normal controls from gene expression analysis in an independent cohort. Taken together, our results revealed that functional biological paths connecting across multi-omics layers can be potentially disrupted by genetic variation in AD. Compared to traditional studies, our novel approach provide additional values to AD research by enabling the discovery of functionally connected markers, and will help provide novel insight into the underlying disease mechanism."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study samples", "text": "Structural MRI and GWAS genotype data analyzed in the present report were obtained from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort.

The interactions were included only if they have 1) direction information (e.g., activation or inhabitation) because we are interested in the upstream genetic regulators of bile acids and 2) confidence scores greater than 0.7 if they are predicted.\nSecond, we downloaded metabolic reactions from RECON [31, 32] . It is now the most comprehensive human metabolic reconstruction available to us, which details all known metabolic reactions occurring in human. All reactions in RECON were curator-validated. We extracted the gene-reaction and metabolite-reaction relationships from their raw data and combined into a metabolic network involving genes, metabolites and reactions. For each reaction, there is one input metabolite, one output metabolite and one or more coding genes for enzymes, receptors or transporters. Finally, we integrated the functional interaction network with the metabolic network based on Entrez ID to generate an integrative network characterizing multiple layers of regulation relationships.

The bile acids that could not be automatically matched to existing database entries were manually annotated. We went through the literatures for their synonyms and searched PubChem, KEGG and CHEBI websites for detailed structure information to confirm and cross-reference the IDs. For bile acids with at least one identifier, we mapped them to the integrated network and extracted a list of candidate genes including enzymes, receptors and transporters directly related to them. The candidate gene set was further expanded by including their upstream genetic interactors (i.e., functional regulators in the REACTOME protein interaction network)."}, {"section_title": "Targeted genetic association analysis", "text": "We extracted a set of SNPs from all candidate genes within \u00b150 kb of each gene boundary and tested their association with 20 AD-related brain imaging phenotypes using a linear regression model in Plink [33] . Age, gender, education, MRI field strength, intracranial volume (ICV) and presence/absence of APOE \u03b54 allele were used as covariates. Given that both SNPs and brain imaging phenotypes are highly correlated, we estimated the number of linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks as and the number of independent phenotypes as . The number of independent association tests is calculated as * . On top of this, we applied the Bonferroni Correction procedure for multiple comparison adjustment.\nLinear regression models were used to examine the association between each pair of SNPs and brain imaging phenotypes. The number of LD blocks is estimated as = 157 and 20 brain imaging phenotypes is found to fall into 3 blocks ( = 3) ( Fig. 3) . After correcting for the estimated number of independent test, our association analysis identified 29 SNPs as significantly associated with left entorhinal cortex thickness and right precuneus volume (Fig. 4 ). More specifically, these SNPs include rs116159950, rs117327561, rs141853576 in NR1H4 belonging to distinct LD blocks, and 26 SNPs from the same LD block of ACOT7. To better understand the function of these two genes, we further examined their connection with AD risk genes [3] in the functional interaction network using Cytoscape Reactome FI plugin (Fig. 5 ). While ACOT7 is located in the downstream of AD risk genes, NR1H4 is predicted to interact with APOE through the linker gene ESR1. According to our integrated network (Fig. 2) , NR1H4 regulates SLC10A2, ABCB11, and ABCC2, which mediate the synthesis of CDCA and/or GDCA, two bile acids associated to AD [27] .

For these 4 bile acids, we extracted genes directly interacting with them, as enzymes, receptors or transporters, and also indirect genetic interactors, which connect to the bile acids through a linker gene. In total, we identified 23 candidate genes related to four AD-altered bile acids, including 14 direct interactors and 9 indirect ones (Fig. 2) .\nBased on the reference genome, 4,964 SNPs, belonging to 157 LD blocks, were identified within \u00b150kb from the boundary of these candidate genes.

We estimated the number of independent interaction tests as ( \u22121) 2 * = 36,738. After Bonferroni correction, 5,337 SNP pairs were found to be significant (See Supplementary File S1).\nThese are 85 unique SNPs in nine genes, including ACOT7, EP300, ACOT8, NCOA1, RARA, SLC10A1, NR1H4, SLCO1A2, and ABCC2. Significant interactions were observed in the right inferior parietal, right inferior temporal, right mid temporal, right precuneus, right superior temporal, right temporal pole regions. Shown in Fig. 6 is the distribution of significant interactions across brain phenotypes. The majority of the significant genetic interactions was found in the temporal cortex region. The interaction between rs76524143 (NCOA1) and rs8036602 (EP300), showed the lowest p value (3.59E-08) after multiple testing correction.\nTo better understand the function of the genes hosting these SNPs, we further examined the connection between these genes and AD risk genes [3] in the functional interaction network using Cytoscape Reactome FI plugin (Fig. 7) . All 9 genes are closely connected with AD risk genes. In particular, EP300 shows as a hub in the functional interaction network, regulating 14 AD risk genes directly or indirectly through linker genes. According to our integrated network (Fig 2) , EP300 functionally regulates ABCC2 gene, which mediates the synthesis of bile acid CDCA.

Out of 10 genes, we identified 4 as significantly differentially expressed in the temporal cortex region after multiple testing correction. A summary of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was presented in Table 3 . "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this study we explored the potential cascade effect of genetic variations on the downstream genes, bile acids and AD quantitative traits. Results from this study revealed a set of heterogeneous AD markers, forming functional biological pathways that cut through multi-omics layers from genome to transcriptome and phenome. For example, as shown in the epistasis results, the upstream regulators, nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group H member 4 (NR1H4) and histone acetyltransferase p300 (EP300) both harbor SNPs significantly associated with the thickness of temporal cortex regions. In temporal cortex, transcription factor NR1H4 and its direct binding targets ATP binding cassette subfamily C member 2 (ABCC2), which directly mediate the level of CDCA, were both found differentially expressed in AD patients (Fig. 8) . The results of this study were further supported by the reported role of NR1H4/FXR (Farnesoid X receptors) in cholesterol homeostasis. NR1H4/FXR is commonly expressed in the liver, intestine and kidneys. It was reported that FXR agonists, such as bile acids and their derivatives, were found to be useful in metabolic syndrome therapies. Later, Huang et al identified functional FXR in brain neurons. Their result provided evidence of the presence of FXR mRNA and protein in the freshly isolated human brain cortex and hippocampal regions, and also potential transcriptional activity of FXR [36] . NR1H4 has been suggested as a potential therapeutic target to slow down AD progression using potent FXR agonists. Studies show that inhibition of FXR signaling help reduce the severity of neurological disorders allied with over accumulation of bile acids [37, 38] .\nEP300 gene encodes the enzyme histone acetyltransferase p300 or E1A-associated protein p300, also known as EP300 or P300. This enzyme functions as histone acetyltransferase that regulates transcription of genes via chromatin remodeling. Findings from multiple studies have suggested the potential of P300 to act as a biomarker for dementia assessment and monitoring AD. Metaanalysis of P300 amplitude and latency reveals useful information about the early stages of AD [39, 40] . The brain regions typically affected in AD, such as frontal cortex parietal cortex and hippocampus, generate P300 wave. It was also strongly associated with cognitive variables, which are impaired in AD as well [41] . In addition, P300 is one of the top candidate master regulators effecting the transcriptional signature of AD progression. The activity of P300 acetyltrasferase was found to be upregulated in AD brain tissue. Acetylation homeostasis dysregulation, one of the possible reasons for neurotoxicity, is mediated by P300 through hyperacetylation of its substrates p53 and histone3 proteins, which are significantly increased in AD brain tissue [42] .\nABCC2/MRP2, regulated by both NR1H4 and EP300, are responsible for the transportation of bile acids. Findings from existing studies suggest that ABC transporters are involved in amyloid \u03b2 accumulation in aging brain and have a potential to serve as futuristic targets in AD therapy [43, 44] . A recent microarray study on AD and brain aging suggested that the regulator of ABCC2, EP300, as a Ca 2+ dependent incipient AD regulating gene [45] and altered Ca 2+ signaling was suspected to have a role in AD [46] .\nACOT7, also known as brain acyl-CoA hydrolase, was previously shown to be enriched in the brain [47, 48] . It is an important regulator in neurometabolism and protects neurons against the damaging effects of fatty acid excess [49] . Loss of ACOT7 expression results in multiple defects in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism in the brain. It is suggested as vital regulatory point in neuronal fatty acid homeostasis. An improved understanding of ACOT7 is beneficial to protect against neurotoxicity owing to the fact that neurological disorders arise from metabolic dysfunction (i.e., lipid metabolism dysregulation). Furthermore, ACOT7 was found to be significantly upregulated in the late stage of AD [50] ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In this study, we performed an integrative analysis of genotype, bile acids and brain imaging phenotype data by leveraging the functional interactions between proteins and bile acids as priori.\nWe identified several AD risk genetic variation, whose downstream genes and bile acids are found to be altered in AD or associated with AD. Taken together, this suggests several trans-omic biological paths disrupted during the development of AD, due to the cascade effect of genetic variation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that analyzed multi-omics data from different layers and generated functional biological paths as potential system biomarkers for AD."}]
