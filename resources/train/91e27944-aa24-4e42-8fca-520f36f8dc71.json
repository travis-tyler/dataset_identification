[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Introduction: Amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) has been investigated as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic drug target. Recent studies found that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b2 fluctuates over time, including as a diurnal pattern, and increases in absolute concentration with serial collection. It is currently unknown what effect differences in CSF collection methodology have on A\u03b2 variability. In this study, we sought to determine the effect of different collection methodologies on the stability of CSF A\u03b2 concentrations over time. Methods: Grouped analysis of CSF A\u03b2 levels from multiple industry and academic groups collected by either lumbar puncture (n=83) or indwelling lumbar catheter (n=178). Participants were either placebo or untreated subjects from clinical drug trials or observational studies. Participants had CSF collected by lumbar puncture or lumbar catheter for quantitation of A\u03b2 concentration by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Data from all sponsors was converted to percent of the mean for A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 for comparison. Repeated measures analysis of variance was performed to assess for factors affecting the linear rise of A\u03b2 concentrations over time. Results: Analysis of studies collecting CSF via lumbar catheter revealed tremendous inter-subject variability of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 as well as an A\u03b2 diurnal pattern in all of the sponsors' studies. In contrast, A\u03b2 concentrations from CSF samples collected at two time points by lumbar puncture showed no significant differences. Repeated measures analysis of variance found that only time and draw frequency were significantly associated with the slope of linear rise in A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 concentrations during the first 6 hours of collection. Conclusions: Based on our findings, we recommend minimizing the frequency of CSF draws in studies measuring A\u03b2 levels and keeping the frequency standardized between experimental groups. The A\u03b2 diurnal pattern was noted in all sponsors' studies and was not an artifact of study design. Averaging A\u03b2 concentrations at each time point is recommended to minimize the effect of individual variability. Indwelling lumbar catheters are an invaluable research tool for following changes in CSF A\u03b2 over 24-48 hours, but factors affecting A\u03b2 concentration such as linear rise and diurnal variation need to be accounted for in planning study designs."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by degeneration of neurons and their synapses leading to progressive cognitive impairment. In the United States, AD is estimated to be the third leading cause of death [1] and to have a financial burden on society comparable with heart disease and cancer [2] . The hallmark of AD at the microscopic level is an overabundance in the brain of extracellular plaques formed by abnormally folded amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of tau. The amyloid hypothesis proposes that the deposition of A\u03b2 in the brain is a key first step in AD pathogenesis that precedes the onset of clinical symptoms by many years [3, 4] . Therefore, A\u03b2 has been investigated both as a diagnostic biomarker for amyloid deposition, measured by imaging (e.g. positron emission tomography imaging with Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB-PET)) or A\u03b242 concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [5] , and as a potential therapeutic target [6, 7] .\nPrevious studies measured A\u03b2 concentrations before and after amyloid deposition to understand potential changes in A\u03b2 metabolism during AD pathogenesis. In these studies, CSF was collected from individuals infrequently via lumbar puncture, generally limited to the beginning and the end of the study. The importance of understanding A\u03b2 metabolism for pharmacologic modeling during trials of investigational compounds led to clinical studies collecting CSF samples repeatedly over 24-48 hours via an indwelling lumbar catheter. A number of these studies have demonstrated considerable intra-subject variability in the levels of CSF A\u03b2 [8, 9] and have also shown a diurnal fluctuation in CSF A\u03b2 that follows the sleep-wake cycle [10] . This diurnal oscillation has also been noted in plasma [11] . The frequency and amount of CSF collected vary greatly in studies employing indwelling catheters. Differences in CSF collection methods could be a factor contributing to the observed variability of A\u03b2 levels. For instance, a recent study found that CSF sampling frequencies and/or sampling volume contributes to intra-subject variability in CSF A\u03b2 levels [12] . Further, sampling hourly via a lumbar catheter has been reported to result in a progressive linear rise in A\u03b2 concentrations. The cause of the A\u03b2 linear rise is unknown but is suspected to be due to changes in CSF flow [10] .\nUnderstanding how different collection methodologies affect the stability of CSF A\u03b2 levels over time is of paramount importance for the design of clinical trials, where these biomarkers would be utilized to study pharmacodynamic activity, and ultimately may determine whether A\u03b2 has utility in a diagnostic fashion. Several investigational compounds that target A\u03b2 are currently in clinical trials [13] . In many cases, particularly in phase I and early phase II trials, the levels of A\u03b2 in CSF are monitored to assess target engagement. Both lumbar punctures and lumbar catheters are used during clinical trials to collect CSF. For instance, both plasma and CSF A\u03b2 levels were monitored in volunteers following treatment with a gamma-secretase inhibitor [14, 15] . In these studies, the levels of plasma A\u03b2 were reduced in a doseresponsive manner, but no significant decreases were observed in the levels of CSF A\u03b2. In addition, a recent study examined the levels of CSF A\u03b2 in AD subjects receiving bapinuzimab, an antibody that targets A\u03b2. No changes in the levels of CSF A\u03b2 from baseline were observed following treatment, although there was a decrease in the levels of CSF tau [16] . In contrast, subjects treated with solanezumab, a selective antibody that targets soluble A\u03b2, demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in total CSF levels of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 [17] . This increase may be due to downstream effects on A\u03b2 plaque dissolution. All of these studies collected CSF via lumbar puncture. Lumbar catheters have also been used for serial CSF sampling, such as when tracking changes in A\u03b2 kinetics (i.e. production and clearance) using stable isotope labeling kinetics [18] . As more therapies targeting A\u03b2 advance into clinical trials, it is expected that the use of A\u03b2 and other CSF biomarkers will increase substantially [19] .\nTo identify the most relevant factors that may contribute to intra-subject variability in CSF A\u03b2 levels, and as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) consortia, we shared data from multiple clinical studies on CSF A\u03b2 measurements from placebo or untreated subjects and conducted a meta-analysis to identify factors that may result in changes in CSF A\u03b2 levels. The combined dataset is the largest collection of participants with serial CSF sampling via a lumbar catheter (n = 178). Our results suggest that the slope of the linear rise in CSF A\u03b2 levels is dependent on the sampling frequency, but does not affect the hourly variability manifesting as an A\u03b2 diurnal pattern. The results from this study will help guide clinical trial design, and provide insight into the relative stability of proteins associated with AD in CSF."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": "Each of the following pharmaceutical research companies or academic research centers contributed the CSF results for A\u03b2 isoform x-40 and x-42 concentrations from assays developed commercially or within the research centers: Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS, New York, NY, USA), AbbVie Inc.

All subjects were screened to be in good general health and without neurologic disease. A lumbar catheter was placed immediately before CSF sample collection started. The subjects were encouraged to stay in bed, and were allowed free choice of when to sleep throughout the study. Each study was conducted on a different group of subjects and each with a different CSF sampling procedure. There were no subject drop-outs or refusals. In Study A1, six healthy young men (25-47 years old) participated, and 5 ml CSF and 4 ml blood were collected from each subject at 0 (6:00 a.m.), 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 22 , and 26 hours. In Study A2, five healthy older men, two healthy older women (61-74 years old), and 15 subjects diagnosed with AD (58-83 years old) participated. Seven milliliters of CSF and 10 ml blood were collected from each subject at 0 (5:30 a.m.), 1, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 hours. In Study A3, eight healthy young men (24-45 years old) participated and were divided into two groups.

To avoid inter-plate variation, all samples from each subject were measured together in duplicates on the same plate, and all of the samples from the same study were measured on the same day. To avoid bias due to intra-plate variation, all samples from each subject were randomized on the plate. The means of the intra-plate CVs for the duplicate samples including a control human CSF sample were <10 %. The means of the inter-plate CVs for the control human CSF sample were <10 %.

SAS 9.2 was used to analyze the data from the model specified above. During the analysis we appropriately choose a covariance structure. The unequal size of the response vector led us to select the SAS option \"KenwardRoger\" as a method for denominator degree of freedom. The interaction effect and the corresponding main effects came out as highly significant for both A\u03b2 isoforms. The normality assumption was also verified through residual plots."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Washington University data", "text": "The data consisted of 392 observations from 57 subjects. The A\u03b2 levels for the first 6 hours were used for the analysis. Both of the response variables (A\u03b240 and A\u03b242) were log-transformed to obtain sufficient symmetry in their distribution. Two age groups were created, based on whether a subject was under or over 65 years of age. Owing to the data being longitudinal I, a linear mixed model was most appropriate for analysis. The subjects were used as the block under repeated statement of mixed procedure of SAS to account for the correlation of the observations from the same subjects.

Average percent of the mean for A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 was calculated at each time point for all of each sponsor's participants. Owing to variability in study designs within individual sponsors, the number of samples collected at each time point is unequal.

Both A\u03b242 and A\u03b240 concentrations exhibited marked variability as a function of time ( Figs. 1 and 2) . A gradual upward drift was generally noted for both analytes and the observed increases did not return to baseline at 24 hours or even after extended sampling for as long as 36 hours.\nA distinctly different pattern was observed in one serial CSF sampling study characterized by a sharp increase in A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 concentrations immediately after initiation of sample collection and followed by a rapidly achieved plateau that was sustained through the remaining sample collection (Figs. 1e and 2e ). In this one study, a bacterial filter was incorporated into the sample collection device and was shown to interact with CSF A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 concentrations recovered from the sample matrix during the first 6 hours of collection, as reported previously [31] . As a result of this methodological difference, data from this one study (Radboud University Medical Center) were not included in all subsequent data analyses.\nPrevious work has shown that A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 concentrations vary with the sleep-wake cycle [10] . Cosinor analysis was used to compare circadian patterns of CSF A\u03b2 dynamics from all of the studies with serial CSF sampling. The sleep-wake cycle was not monitored in these participants and could not be incorporated into the analysis. There were two sponsors with a large number of participants who underwent similar clinical trial designs in terms of frequency of CSF draws. The seven Merck studies (M1-M7) involved 38 participants (mean age 44.2 years, SD 11.2). The second study from Washington University included 57 subjects (mean age 60.7 years, SD 19). In both studies, CSF draws were taken approximately every 1-2 hours for 24-36 hours. Fig. 3 shows the simultaneous fit of the linear rise and cosine transformation to the mean-adjusted group average (percent of mean) data for the Merck and Washington University studies. Both A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 showed significant cosinor fits for both studies compared with a straight line (p <0.0001 for all analytes). Further, the 95 % confidence intervals for amplitude do not cross zero for both sets of studies (Fig. 3) . The slope of the linear rise is also similar for both A\u03b240 and A\u03b242. The amplitude of the Merck studies is higher than that seen in the Washington University data, a difference possibly attributable to an overall younger population. Finally, the amplitude peaks occurred at approximately 20:00-21:00 p.m. in both studies and for both A\u03b240 and A\u03b242.\nWe also performed cosinor analysis on the meanadjusted group average (percent of mean) data from three additional sponsors: AbbVie, BMS, and Lilly (Fig. 4) . Despite variability in study design, numbers of participants, and sampling at each time point, studies from all sponsors showed a cosine fit for A\u03b240 concentrations and all but AbbVie studies showed a cosine fit for A\u03b242 concentrations. Peak amplitude showed greater variability in these three studies and occurred at different times of day, although the time was the same for A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 within each study sponsor. AbbVie studies had similar peak times for both A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 compared with the Merck and Washington University studies (21:00-22:00 p.m.). Both the Lilly and BMS studies had earlier peak times. For the Lilly studies, this may be due to an overall earlier start time: the Lilly studies began CSF collection as early as 02:00 a.m. and had a peak time of 16:00 p.m. for both A\u03b240 and A\u03b242. An earlier start time, however, does not account for the BMS studies that began CSF collection at 06:00 a.m. and had a peak time of 13:00-14:00 p.m. Differences in participant sleep-wake activity are unknown for all studies; therefore we cannot account for changes in sleep-wake patterns between studies that may correlate with differences in peak times. BMS was found to have the highest amplitude and slope for A\u03b240 and A\u03b242, but also had the youngest participants (mean age 31.6 years, SD 6.5) compared with Merck, Washington University, AbbVie (mean age 55.8 years, SD 17. "}, {"section_title": "Linear rise in A\u03b2 concentration", "text": "Statistical analysis was performed to identify factors that were significantly associated with the change in increasing linear trend for both A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 over time. We analyzed the slope of the A\u03b2 increase over the first 6 hours relative to the number of CSF draws made during that time period. Since the studies differed in duration, only the first 6 hours were used in the analysis. The increase appeared to be the most dramatic during this time period. Factors such as age group, gender, ethnicity, frequency of draws, sponsor, and time were analyzed. For this analysis, subjects were divided into three age groups defined as \"young\" (<30 years old), \"medium\" (between the ages of 30 and 50), and \"old\" (50 years and older). Similarly, the number of draws within the first 6 hours were also categorized into three levels (groups 1, 2 and 3): group 1 had three draws or less in the first 6 hours, group 2 had greater than three but less than seven draws in the first 6 hours, and group 3 subjects had seven draws or more within the first 6 hours.\nOf these factors, only the frequency of the CSF draw, time, and the interaction of draw frequency and time were significant ( Table 3 ). The repeated-measures analysis (or linear mixed model), described in Materials and methods, showed that the interaction effects of the number of draws relative to time were significant for both A\u03b240 and A\u03b242. We further obtained the estimates of the slope of time within each draw group. All of the estimates were positively associated with the frequency of CSF draws. Further analysis revealed that the slope over time for draw groups 3 differed significantly from zero ( Table 4 ), indicating that more frequent CSF draws resulted in a larger slope. Several factors were not known for the majority of the studies, most importantly amyloid status and sleep parameters that may affect the slope of the linear rise.\nAge was not a significant factor for the combined data. In the industry studies, however, only 15 out of the 107 subjects (minus the RUMC data) were older than 65 years. In contrast, 36 out of 57 subjects in the Washington University dataset were older than 65 years. Analysis of this dataset alone showed a trend towards an effect of age on the rise in A\u03b2 levels in the first 6 hours. Younger subjects showed a greater change in A\u03b242 levels over time relative to older subjects (p = 0.02); however, for A\u03b240 there was no significant difference between the age groups in terms of the change in A\u03b2 levels in the first 6 hours (p value = 0.17). Again, this difference between age groups and A\u03b2 isoforms may be due to amyloid deposition, a factor not included in this analysis."}, {"section_title": "Lumbar puncture findings", "text": "For untreated or placebo-treated subjects enrolled in four separate clinical studies, intra-subject variability for CSF A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 collected by lumbar puncture were generally stable on comparison between baseline and endpoint sampling scheduled approximately 2 weeks apart. Occasionally, individuals exhibited notable shifts from baseline (increase or decrease); however, the majority of subjects exhibited stable results. Within individual studies, lumbar punctures were performed at approximately the same time of day. Overall, no significance difference between the endpoint and baseline for A\u03b242 and A\u03b240 was observed (p = 0.54 and p = 0.14 respectively) (Fig. 5a,b) . In addition, A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 results for individual samples were highly correlated (r = 0.8; p <0.001)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We examined CSF A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 concentrations across multiple studies from four different companies and two academic institutions. While a tremendous amount of inter-individual variability existed, a general pattern of rapidly increasing concentrations of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 in the first 12 hours of a study was found across all subjects in all indwelling lumbar catheter studies; in some cases, A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 reached levels as high as 200 % from the initial baseline draw. In most of the subjects, the slope of the linear rise decreased after the first 24 hours, but the levels did not return to baseline by 24 hours. Our results suggest that the use of indwelling catheters to collect multiple CSF samples results in an upward drift in the levels of both A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 relative to the initial draw. In contrast, the levels of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 did not change significantly from baseline to second draw when samples were taken by lumbar puncture performed at a similar time of the day 2 weeks apart.\nThe tremendous inter-subject variability of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 seen over time could influence the results of AD prevention studies that target A\u03b2. Averaging A\u03b2 concentrations at each time point is recommended to minimize the effect of individual variability and distinguish effects between experimental groups. We further recommend managing this variability by calculating the area under the curve using pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models. For example, a previous study of a gamma-secretase inhibitor was able to show relatively small effects on A\u03b2 in CSF collected via indwelling lumbar catheters using this technique [18] .\nA circadian rhythm is a cyclic oscillation intrinsic to many biologic processes, such as body temperature and hormone levels, and is typically studied using cosinor analysis to fit a cosine transformation with a 24-hour period. A\u03b2 concentrations have been found to fluctuate over time in several studies collecting CSF via a lumbar catheter [8, 9] . Further, a previous study correlated fluctuating CSF A\u03b2 levels to the sleep-wake cycle (i.e. a diurnal pattern) in healthy young normal control subjects and older adults more than 60 years old with and without amyloid deposition [10] . In that study, younger controls demonstrated much higher amplitude of A\u03b2 oscillation as compared with amyloid-positive or amyloid-negative older adults.\nDespite heterogeneity in the frequency of CSF collection in this study, we found evidence in data from all sponsors for a diurnal pattern of both A\u03b240 and A\u03b242. The only exception was the AbbVie data for A\u03b242 which showed a mesor-to-peak amplitude of 4.29 % with 95 % confidence intervals that do not cross zero (0.71-7.87) suggesting a cosinor fit, but only a trend toward a difference with a straight line was noted (p = 0.06). This discrepancy is attributable to both the scatter of the data points in the first and last 6 hours of sampling due to CSF collection occurring at slightly different times of day across the AbbVie studies and a limited sampling time of 24 hours, the shortest period among all of the sponsors. Prior work analyzed a smaller group of subjects from the AbbVie studies (n = 21 compared with n = 36 in our analysis) and reported that intra-subject variability was related to sampling frequency and/or sampling volume [12] . We suspect a diurnal oscillation was not seen in this prior work because each study was analyzed separately (n = 6-8/study) and not as a larger pooled analysis.\nCosinor parameters, such as amplitude, differed across all studies. A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 showed similar oscillations within study sponsor, but not between all study sponsors. The peak-to-trough amplitude fluctuations of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 varied between sponsors from approximately 8.52 to 14.02 % per 24 hours. The peak time of A\u03b2 levels also varied between study sponsors. For example, both the Merck and Washington University datasets were found to have A\u03b2 levels peak at roughly 13-14 hours after the collection was started (which is equivalent t\u00f5 20:00-21:00 p.m.). BMS, however, peaked earlier for both A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 at approximately 8 hours after collection started (14:00 p.m.). In contrast, A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 peaked at approximately 14 hours after collection started in the Lilly studies (16:00 p.m.) and at approximately 16-17 hours after collection started in the AbbVie studies (21:00-22:00 p.m.).\nThese discrepancies in the amplitudes and peak time of CSF A\u03b2 fluctuation are possibly due to differences in participant ages, sample collection schedules, analytic techniques used between sites, participant stress levels, participant amyloid status, and differences in sleep-wake activity between participants in the different groups. Our findings suggest that the A\u03b2 diurnal pattern is not a timekeeper that directly interacts with the circadian clock, but is dependent on human processes with a diurnal patternsuch as changes in neuronal activity with the sleep-wake cycle as described previously [10, 33] -and may be modifiable [34] . The timing and amount of participant sleep as well as light exposure were not monitored in these studies; therefore we cannot test our hypothesis that differences in sleep-wake activity accounts for the inter-study difference in A\u03b2 oscillation. However, the finding of an A\u03b2 diurnal pattern for both A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 despite study heterogeneity and other confounders strongly suggests that this oscillation is due to an intrinsic human biological process rather than an artifact of experimental design.\nSince the studies enrolled subjects of different demographics and different protocols were employed for CSF collection across the studies, statistical analysis was conducted to identify factors that were associated with the rise in A\u03b2 levels. Factors such as age, gender, clinical sponsor, and frequency of CSF draws were all analyzed. In the industry-sponsored studies, where considerable variability existed in the CSF collection designs, the frequency of CSF draws was significantly associated with the A\u03b2 rise. The results indicated that performing more than seven CSF draws in the first 6 hours of the study had a large effect on the rise in CSF A\u03b2, while the rise in CSF A\u03b2 was largely not evident in studies that collected six or less draws in the first 6 hours. This finding is similar to previous reports from AbbVie that sampling frequency was a factor in the A\u03b2 linear rise [12] . Several of the same studies sponsored by AbbVie are included in this analysis, but our study includes additional industry and academic sponsors and shows the same effect. The A\u03b2 linear rise is not a diurnal effect and is most probably a consequence of frequent CSF draws via an indwelling lumbar catheter leading to a shift in the rostrocaudal dynamics in CSF. A recent study showed that levels of A\u03b2 were higher in CSF collected from the cisterna in patients suffering from trigeminal neuralgia relative to CSF from lumbar draws taken from patients suffering from tension-type headaches [35] . Potentially, frequent CSF draws from the lumbar region could result in an increase in the flow of CSF from the cisterna to the lumbar region, where A\u03b2 levels may be higher. The volume of CSF collected may also be involved, although we could not address this question because all but one study (Study M3, n = 6; Table 2 ) collected 6-8 ml/draw. Factors that affect the concentration of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 may also be involved in the linear rise. For instance, previous work has shown attenuation in the linear rise of A\u03b242 in amyloidpositive individuals [10] . Studies that involve different CSF collection protocols and labeling of CSF A\u03b2 may help to address this question [36] .\nThe studies conducted at Washington University in St Louis enrolled subjects in different age groups. In these studies, there was a trend towards age being a significant factor for the rise in CSF A\u03b2 levels, with younger subjects showing significantly higher increases relative to older subjects for A\u03b242. Previous studies examining age and the rise in CSF A\u03b2 levels did not show an effect in amyloid-negative subjects [10] . However, in that study, the rise in A\u03b2 was calculated over a 24-hour period, rather than the first 6 hours. In addition, subjects that were amyloid-positive did display smaller increases in CSF A\u03b2 levels over time."}, {"section_title": "Implications for future clinical trial design", "text": "The issue concerning whether or not significant fluctuations in CSF A\u03b2 concentrations occur owing to CSF collection methodology is of paramount importance for the design of clinical trials where these biomarkers would be utilized to study pharmacodynamic activity, and ultimately may determine whether these biomarkers have utility in a diagnostic fashion. Further, the use of a filter system in the sampling setup employed by RUMC illustrates that the selection of sampling materials and the configuration of those materials on the recovery of A\u03b2 species from CSF pulled through catheter systems needs to be carefully evaluated. Overall, our analysis has identified that frequency of CSF draws and age are factors that contribute to the linear rise in A\u03b2 levels. The A\u03b2 diurnal pattern, in contrast, is suggested to be an intrinsic process that occurs independent of CSF collection methodology. These findings are important for the design of studies of A\u03b2. For instance, a recent trial investigated whether sleep deprivation resulted in an increase in CSF A\u03b2 concentration [34] . The study did show an increase in the A\u03b242 concentration in the sleep-deprived group compared with the normal sleep control group, but A\u03b240 did not show the same pattern as A\u03b242. This is in contrast to our results that show A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 oscillating together. The sleep-deprived group had an additional four CSF collection time points between hours 5 and 13 that complicate the study interpretation because differences in CSF collection may account for the rise in CSF A\u03b242 concentration and discordance with A\u03b240, although additional analyses of total protein showed that there was no effect of the differential sampling on CSF protein concentration between the two groups. From our analysis, it is recommended that the frequency of CSF draws should kept to no more than 1/hour with a volume of 6-8 ml in order to minimize changes in CSF A\u03b2 with frequent draws, particularly in the first 6 hours of collection; also, it is critical that a standard draw frequency be utilized across all study groups. Our data are not sufficient to determine whether these are the optimal CSF draw volume and frequency to control for the linear rise. Further, the linear rise needs to be accounted for during analysis of A\u03b2 levels in CSF collected by indwelling lumbar catheters either by fitting both a cosine function and linear rise simultaneously as we have done, or by subtracting out the linear rise before cosinor analysis as reported previously [10] ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Indwelling lumbar catheters are an invaluable research tool for following changes in CSF A\u03b2 over 24-48 hours, but factors affecting A\u03b2 concentration such as linear rise and diurnal variation need to be accounted for in planning study designs."}, {"section_title": "Additional file", "text": "Additional file 1: Figure S1 .
