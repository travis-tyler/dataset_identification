Dunkel et al. (2015) validated their version of the SLH CAQ template by showing that young adults whose CAQ profiles correlated more strongly with it were also characterized by reproductive behaviors indicative of a slow LHS (e.g. later age at sexual debut). As described in detail in section 2.1.4, published analyses (McCrae, Costa, & Busch, 1986 ) provide a means to score any CAQ profile on each of the FFM dimensions. The relationships, across individuals, between (1) the correlation between each individual's CAQ profile and the SLH CAQ template (hereafter, CAQ-based slow LHS) and (2) the individual's CAQ-generated score on each FFM dimension, permit inferences about the relationships between the FFM dimensions and Life History Speed. Scores on Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, and Emotional Stability are expected to be higher in individuals scoring higher in CAQ-based slow LHS. If Extraversion and Openness are mixed dimensions with respect to LHS (Del Giudice, 2012 , 2014a , then they will be weakly related or unrelated to CAQ-based slow LHS. Analogous analyses using individual CAQ items that load on Extraversion and Openness can shed light on whether different facets of those traits are differentially related to LHS. Are Extraversion-loading items tapping interpersonal warmth (as distinct from assertiveness or excitement-seeking), and Openness items tapping intellect (as distinct from imagination), more likely to be positively associated with CAQ-based slow LHS?\nAs a second approach, in one of two studies I assess the relationships among (1) LHS and personality dimension measures derived from the CAQ (described above), (2) a self-report LHS measure (the Arizona Life History Battery [ALHB]: Figueredo, 2007) , and (3) a self-report personality inventory based on the HEXACO personality model (Ashton & Lee, 2001 .\nReasons for measuring the HEXACO dimensions rather than the FFM dimensions are described by Manson (2015) and are beyond the scope of this paper. The analyses reported in the present study afford tests of the validity of the three CAQ-measured FFM dimensions that have HEXACO counterparts: Extraversion, Openness, and Conscientiousness. HEXACO Agreeableness and Emotionality represent an alternative rotation of the personality space covered in the FFM by Agreeableness and Neuroticism (Ashton & Lee, 2001 Lee, , 2007 , so these two FFM dimensions cannot be validated by self-report in the present study. The self-report data also permit tests of the relationships between each HEXACO Extraversion and Openness facet and both the ALHB and CAQ-based slow LHS.\nFinally, the self-report data enable the second goal of the proposed study, which is a preliminary attempt to examine the convergent validity of the ALHB and the SLH CAQ template as measures of Life History Strategy. How strongly associated are ALHB scores and CAQbased slow LHS, and how is their relationship mediated by personality dimensions?\nWhen an item loaded on two or more factors, it was scored only for the factor on which it had the highest loading. To maintain consistency with McCrae et al's (1986) presentation, I scored individuals with respect to Neuroticism (the inverse of Emotional Stability).\nI carried out multiple regression analyses in which CAQ-based slow LHS was the dependent variable, and unit-weighted scores on the five FFM dimensions were the predictor variables. I planned to conduct mediation analyses to assess each CAQ-generated FFM dimension's mediating effect on the relationship between the ALHB-derived K-Factor and CAQbased slow LHS. However, this relationship failed to attain statistical significance ( Table 1) . As an alternative, I improvised analytical procedures, described in Section 2.2.6, to assess the influences of Extraversion, Openness and Conscientiousness on the relationship between the two LHS measures.\nreliabilities of the measures were acceptable (>.67), with the exception of CAQ-generated\nOpenness. Removing three CAQ items from the scale (007, \"Favors conservative values\"; 041, \"Makes moral judgments\"; and 062, \"Rebellious and nonconforming\") increased alpha from .33\nto .57. Correlations of both the original and reliability-adjusted versions of Openness with the other measures are shown. Notably, ALHB scores were not significantly related to CAQ-based LHS (p = .11) or to any of the CAQ-generated FFM scores except for Neuroticism (negatively).\nAmong the HEXACO dimensions, ALHB was positively correlated with Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness. Note that, in contrast, the zero-order correlation between CAQ-based slow LHS and CAQ-based Extraversion showed a non-significant trend (p = .07) toward a negative association.\n\nAt the level of FFM factors' relationships to LHS, results from the two studies did not differ greatly (Tables 2 and 7 ). This finding is noteworthy because, although both samples consisted of young adults residing in the United States, they differed in important respects. The Study 1 participants were university students, a slight majority of whom were Asian or AsianAmerican, and almost all of whom were born in the mid-1990s. In contrast, Block and Block However, at the level of individual CAQ items (Tables 3-4) , results from the two studies differed somewhat, as discussed below, although they were significantly similar overall. The differences might result from differences between the two studies' assessment methods or populations. With respect to assessment methods, for peer raters using only audio recordings as stimuli (Study 1), participants' spontaneous verbal behavior presumably had greater relative (1986) , showed poor inter-item reliability. The three items responsible for this (007, \"Favors conservative values\"; 041, \"Makes moral judgments\"; and 062, \"Rebellious and nonconforming\") were the items driving the negative relationship between CAQ-based Openness and CAQ-based slow LHS; when they were removed from the Openness scale, this relationship\n\nvanished. Interestingly, items 007 and 041 are also, like talkativeness, items that might be perceived differently by Study 1 raters than by Study 2 raters. In Study 2, the inter-item reliability of Openness was the lowest of the FFM dimensions, but still acceptably high, as is generally found in FFM self-report inventories (Viswesvaran & Ones, 2000) . Second, in Study 1, individuals pursuing a slower LH were less influenced by social pressures (item 063), whereas the opposite was true in Study 2. This might reflect differences between the social pressures faced by college students and those faced by the more heterogeneous and slightly older population from which the Study 2 participants were drawn. In general, however, the observed patterns support Del Giudice's (2012, 2014a) hypothesis about the relationships of the various Openness facets to LHS.\nIn contrast, the Study 1 participants' scores on the self-report HEXACO Extraversion and Openness facet scores (Table 5) Surprisingly, the ALHB and CAQ-based slow LHS (i.e. the correlation between an individual's CAQ profile and the SLH CAQ template) were not significantly correlated, despite being derived from the same theoretical conceptualization of Life History Speed variation as a source of individual differences (Dunkel et al., 2015; Figueredo et al., 2004 Figueredo et al., , 2007 Sherman et al., 2013) . This result might reflect differences between the perspectives of self-report (the ALHB) and other-rating (the CAQ-based slow LHS scores). In a series of studies, Dunkel et al. (2016) found somewhat higher, though still modest (r = .16-.27), correlations between self-report LH instruments and CAQ-based peer-ratings of LHS when raters' only information about target individuals consisted of brief videotaped conversations or transcripts of answers to questions about major life events. Additionally, it is possible that peculiarities of my Audio Sampling participant sample are responsible for the non-significant relationship between ALHB and CAQbased slow LHS in the present study. Further research is necessary to explore the convergent validity of these two measures. However, the different relationships between personality dimensions and the variation shared by the two LHS instruments suggest that they measure\nconstructs that overlap only partially. Controlling for Conscientiousness attenuated the correlation between them almost completely, whereas controlling for Extraversion increased the correlation. Some CAQ items that load positively on Extraversion were negatively related to CAQ-based slow LHS, while some CAQ items that load negatively on Extraversion were positively related to CAQ-based slow LHS (Table 3 ). In contrast, many of the ALHB items tap high-Extraversion content, whereas few to none of them tap low-Extraversion content.\nSpecifically, the ALHB's Friends Contact and Support, Family Contact and Support, and\nAltruism scales partly tap variation in the enjoyment of social situations, while the Insight, Planning, and Control scale partly taps a propensity toward positive affect.\nAlthough this study did not construct measures of the General Factor of Personality (Musek, 2007) \nAlthough beyond the scope of this paper, analyses of relationships between LHS and the Big Two, based on CAQ ratings, would be illuminating. More generally, additional research is needed to determine both the broader and the narrower personality dimensions, as well as individual differences outside the realm of personality, that fit within the nomological network surrounding psychometric assessments of human LHS (Figueredo et al., 2014) .\nOne limitation of this study is that the Study 1 participants did not provide any data on biometric LH variables such as age at puberty (Copping, Campbell, & Muncer, 2014 ; but see Figueredo et al., 2015) . A second limitation is that, although the CAQ has been adapted (Dunkel et al., 2015; Sherman et al., 2013) to measure an evolutionary construct, Life History strategy, the instrument itself originated in psychodynamically oriented psychiatry (Block, 1978) .\nUnsurprisingly, the content of many of the items is tangential to evolutionary questions, whereas several behavioral domains central to evolutionary social science (e.g. kin bias) are absent from the CAQ item set. The Q-sort method, in general, is a more powerful psychometric tool than the more commonly used Likert-based instruments (Block, 1978; Sherman, Nave, & Funder, 2010) .\nA personality Q-set based explicitly on evolutionary concepts would be a valuable contribution.\n\nPositively loading items A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T Table 4 Correlations from both studies between Openness-loading items and participants' CAQ profiles' correlations with the SLH template (CAQ-based Slow LHS).\n"}, {"section_title": "Study 1", "text": "Study 1 used periodic brief audio recordings from participants' daily lives as the basis for constructing CAQ profiles.

These included the Arizona Life History Battery (ALHB: Figueredo, 2007 ) and the HEXACO-60 (Ashton & Lee, 2009 ). The ALHB is a 199-item self-report instrument consisting of eight scales drawn from various original sources (Barrera, Sandler, & Ramsay, 1981; Brennan, Clark, & Shaver, 1998; Brim et al., 2000) .

The eighth ALHB scale, the Mini-K, contains 20 items tapping general features of all seven LHS facets. The eight indicators converge on a single multivariate latent construct, the K-Factor (Gladden et al., 2009; Wenner, Bianchi, Figueredo, Rushton, & Jacobs, 2013) , which can be estimated as the mean of the z-scores of the seven scales excluding the Mini-K (Figueredo, 2007) . Because the sample was drawn from an undergraduate population, I deleted from analyses the 8 items of the Altruism Toward Children subscale.\nIn the HEXACO-60 (Ashton & Lee, 2009) Unconventionality. I calculated each facet score as the mean score across its constituent nonmissing items. Each dimension score was then calculated as the mean across its four facet scores, and standardized.\nfrom \"1 = extremely uncharacteristic\" to \"9 = extremely characteristic\" with category 5 labeled as \"neither characteristic nor uncharacteristic.\" The number of items per category is pre-set, such that the two most extreme categories each contain five items, categories farther from the extremes contain progressively more items, and category 5 contains the most items (18). Thus, raters are constrained to arrange the items in a quasi-normal distribution.\nTwenty-four raters, ignorant of the study's hypotheses, were trained in the use of the CAQ and were instructed to generate CAQ profiles of participants based on their audio clips and hourly event diaries. To standardize the protocol, raters were instructed to listen to each audio clip no more than three times (if necessary to understand unclear speech) and not to listen again to any clip after listening to the entire set of each participant's clips. Raters were not permitted to generate a CAQ profile if they recognized the voice of a participant or any of a participant's interlocutors. The mean number of CAQ profiles generated per rater was 11.0 (SD = 7.4). My initial goal was to obtain three profiles for every participant. However, 13 of the 92 participants spoke languages other than English in >4 audio clips, necessitating the recruitment of raters fluent in those languages (Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, Korean, Vietnamese and Armenian).\nThus, 84 participants were described by three raters, five participants by two raters, and three participants by one rater. For each participant, a profile was constructed by averaging the placement of each of the 100 CAQ items across the raters who described that participant.\ncorrelating at r = .86 (Dunkel et al., 2015) . In both versions of the SLH CAQ template, the most characteristic items include \"Genuinely dependable person,\" \"Warmth, capacity for close relationships,\" \"Protective of those close to her/him,\" \"Moralistic,\" and \"Favors conservative values.\" The items most uncharacteristic of a slow LHS (i.e. most characteristic of a fast LHS)\ninclude \"Unpredictable in behavior/attitudes,\" \"Guileful, deceitful and manipulative,\" \"Rebellious, nonconforming,\" \"Unable to delay gratification,\" and \"Keeps people at a distance.\"\nThe correlation between each participant's CAQ profile and the SLH CAQ template from Sherman et al. (2013) was calculated and then transformed using the Fisher r-to-z transformation.\nThis will be referred to as a participant's CAQ-based slow LHS score.\nBased on data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (Shock et al., 1984) , McCrae et al. (1986) describe a factor analysis of CAQ self-ratings and expert interview-based CAQ ratings that yielded five factors corresponding to the FFM dimensions. These factors demonstrated convergent and discriminative validity with respect to self-, peer-, and spouseratings using FFM-based instruments. Seventy-eight of the 100 CAQ items loaded on at least one of the five factors, 18 items loaded on two or more factors, and one item loaded on three factors. I used McCrae et al's (1986) factor loadings, and followed their method of calculating, for each CAQ profile, a unit-weighted score for each FFM dimension. This calculation consisted of adding the placements (ranging from \"1 = extremely uncharacteristic\" to \"9 = extremely characteristic\") of the CAQ items that loaded on each FFM factor at >.30, and subtracting the placements of the CAQ items that loaded on that factor at <-.30. As examples, the items with the highest and lowest loadings, respectively, on Extraversion were \"Is a talkative individual\" and \"Emotionally bland; flattened affect.\" The items with the highest and lowest loadings, respectively, on Openness were \"Values intellectual matters\" and \"Favors conservative values\"\n\nafter excluding, from the CAQ profiles, all the items that load on Openness, and .14 after excluding only the items that comprised reliability-adjusted CAQ Openness (see Section 2.2.1).\nPositively loading items A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Table 6 Study 2: correlations among California Q-Sort (CAQ) generated unit-weighted FFM scores and CAQ-based Slow LHS (n = 102). \n"}, {"section_title": "California adult Q-sort (CAQ) rating", "text": "The California Adult Q-Sort, or Q-Set (CAQ: Block, 1978) , modified for use by nonprofessionals by Bem and Funder (1978) consists of 100 statements describing a broad range of personality features, e.g. \"Is sociable, gregarious; emphasizes being with others\" and \"Feels a lack of meaning in life.\" Raters are required to sort each item into one of nine categories ranging A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T"}, {"section_title": "Analysis", "text": "One use of the CAQ is to compare (i.e. correlate) participants' CAQ profiles to a template designed to represent a psychological construct, e.g. primary psychopathy (Reise & Oliver, 1994) .
