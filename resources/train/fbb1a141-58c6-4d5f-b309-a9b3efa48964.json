[{"section_title": "", "text": "After the data are segregated by land ownership arrangement and solvency class, the resulting distribution of farm operations is analyzed. The study then investigates how the distribution of farms among the classification categories would change if annual government payments are subtracted from net farm income. To accomplish this, government payments are first subtracted from net farm income to create a new net farm income; then each farm was assigned a new solvency class based on the new net farm income. After the new data were compiled, a comparison was done between data that include government payments and data that do not include government payments. The study found that the absence of farm subsidies did not have a large effect on structural and financial characteristics of farms in 1996farms in and 2003farms in . Specifically, in 1996 if government payment had not been distributed in Iowa, 9.5 percent of farms in solvency class I (positive net farm income and debt-to-asset ratio less than 0.40) would have IV shifted to solvency class II (negative net fann income and debt-to-asset ratio of below 0.40). In Tennessee, in 2003, a similar shift would have occurred to only 1 % of fanns in solvency class I. However, in 2000, the year in the study in which the largest amount of subsidies was distributed, the absence of them affected the distribution of farms by structural and financial characteristics dramatically. In many cases, especially in Iowa, the subsidies represented the difference in negative and positive net farm. incomes. For instance, a 28% shift from solvency class I to solvency class II would have taken place in Iowa. In conclusion, the study shows that although farm subsidies may not be a major factor in the financial health of the farm sector in some years; in other years the payments are crucial to the financial well being of the businesses that make up the industry. The study makes no judgments concerning the use of farm subsidies; it merely depicts the structure and financial characteristics of farms in Iowa and Tennessee in their presence and absence.

The federal government has provided monetary aid to the sector since the 1930s. The distribution of agriculturalsubsidies has been a highly contentious issue recently, and the issue has become so prevalent that it surfaces in the mainstream media on a regular basis. \u2022 Critics have even gone as far as attributing terrorism as partially the result of U. S. farm subsidies keeping world prices down, which in turn makes farmers in third world countries so miserably poor that they feel terrorism is the only way to have their message heard (Thurow and Kilman 2002). On the other side, some believe that subsidy programs are the very reason the industry has been so successful, citing that subsidies control price fluctuations, which allow room for the innovative risk taking that has allowed technology in the industry to soar (Boulding 1983). This study is not designed to justify the use nor the historical impact of United States government subsidies; rather it assumes that government payments are already in place and attempts to reveal their role in farm incomes and solvencies."}, {"section_title": "Problem and Obiectives", "text": "In order to better understand the role of government payments in American agriculture, it is necessary to first understand the methods by which they are distributed, and then to understand the relationship of payments to farms. The next section discusses the various types of subsidies currently in place. The remainder of the study attempts to gain insight regarding the relationship between farm financial vulnerability and agricultural subsidies. In order to accomplish this, a classification system of farms is developed that considers the characteristics of farms that are affected by the government 1 subsidies, and then measure the changes that would take place if government payments were eliminated. Most government subsidies to agriculture are awarded to producers on the basis of current prices, and/or what and how much they produce either currently or historically. By design, payments to producers are generally derived from nationallyiuniform, predetermined formulas, and their variation is due to current prices and units of production,\u2022sometimes adjusted regionally. These payments do not take into account other measures that may \u2022 be determining factors of the operators' financial health, such as solvency or net farm income. Understanding how these characteristics are affected by subsidies will provide a better understanding of the role of the subsidies in farm enterprises. The goal of this study is to better understand the role of government subsidies in the farm sector in Iowa and Tennessee., Three objectives are identified to meet this goal. First, developing a classification system that considers structural characteristics and economic indicators is necessary. Second, an analysis of farm structure and subsidy distribution based on the new classification system will depict farm characteristics associated with the classification. Third, a comparison is made between farm \u2022 distribution, by financial and structural characteristics, in the presence and absence of subsidies."}, {"section_title": "Discussion of Subsidies", "text": "Currently, government subsidies in the United States are distributed according to several conditions. These conditions generally include product produced, market prices, current and/or historical production, and the amount of land taken out of production. The payments are authorized, funded, and distributed through several federal programs. These programs include (but are not limited to) marketing assistanc\ufffd loans, loan . deficiency payments, production flexibility contracts, direct payments, countercyclical payment payments, emergency and supplemental assistance payments, Conservation Reserve program payments, and Conservation Security Program payments. Marketing assistance loans are distributed by the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), an entity within the United States Department of Agriculture. These loans are considered \"nonrecourse\", and available to producers of com, cotton, wheat, soybeans, rice, grain sorghum, oats, barley, and peanuts. Producers of these crops can take out \u2022 \u2022 loans, using their harvested crops as collateral, provided that the crops are stored in a government approved facility. The amount of the loan is based on a per unit loan rate established nationally either annually, or by the preceding farm bill, depending on the crop. The 2002 farm bill set loan rates for all program crops for the years 2002-2007. The life of the loan in most cases is nine months, and a stipulation exists that requires the product to be stored in a government approved facility. Marketing assistance loans can be satisfied in one of three ways. The first is to repay the loan at any time prior to maturity including applicable, accrued interest, which is one percent higher than the rate that treasury secured the loan to the CCC. The second way to repay the loan is to repay it at the alternative loan rate. The alternative loan rate is related to the posted county price for com, soybeans, wheat, oats, grain sorghum, oats and barley, and the prevailing world price for rice and upland cotton. County prices are posted daily and world prices weekly. If the alternative loan rate. is lower than the national loan rate, the farmer can elect to repay the loan at the alternative rate, in which case interest on the original loan is voided. In such cases, the difference between the initial loan repayment including interest accrued and the alternative rate is called a marketing loru,i \u2022 gain. The third alternative to satisfy a . market assistance loan is to simply forfeit the commodity held as collateral at loan maturity. As with the second option, interest is waived upon forfeiture in this instance. This alternative is the embodiment of the term nonrecourse, as there is no penalty associated with forfeiture of the collateral. Loan deficiency payments are underpinned by the same ideology as marketing assistance loans, except the producer does not have to enter into a loan with the government to realize them. These payments are calculated by taking the difference between the annual loan rate and the posted county price when the former is higher. Loan deficiency payments can be taken any time; and as the county price is posted daily, there is risk associated. Crops used for loan deficiency payments immediately become ineligible for marketing assistance loans. Both marketing assistance loans and loan deficiency payments are subject to limitations of $75,000 per crop per year; and the three entity rule is in effect which stipulates that no single farmer can receive more than one full payment from one crop and two half payments for additional crops. Production flexibility contracts were introduced in 1996 in the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996. The resulting payments are decoupled from production in that they are autonomous of what is produced; rather, they consider the land on which the eligible crop was produced in the past. Eligible crops included com, wheat, upland cotton, rice, grain sorghum, barley, and oats. In order to receive these payments, producers entered into contracts with the government in 1996. The land historically used to produce eligible crops determined base acreage. Upon determination of base acreage, the government agreed to pay the farmer a sum equal to the product of the associated payment rate for the commodity, payment yield, and 85% of the base acreage. Production flexibility payments were paid in every . year of the contract irrespective of production decisions or market conditions. In 2002, The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act altered and renamed production flexibility contracts. The new name is direct payments, and their scope was broadened to include soybe\ufffds, peanuts, and previously excluded oilseeds. These payments are calculated in the same manner as production flexibility contracts, with updated payment rates and the opportunity for farmers to update base acreage and program yield, under certain conditions. The year 2002 also saw the introduction of counter cyclical payments. These payments are aimed at adjusting support levels for producers based on current market conditions, and employ target pricing. Countercyclical payments are calculated by several variables, only one of which is fixed (target price). To find the countercyclical payment rate, both the commodity price and the national loan rate are considered. Whichever of these is higher is added to the previously calculated direct payment rate for the associated commodity. This number is then subtracted from the target price to determine the payment rate. After the payment rate is calculated, the countercyclical payment can be derived as the product of 85% of the base acreage, the payment yield for the commodity, and the payment rate for the commodity. Countercyclical payments are not issued every year. Only when market prices are sufficiently low do the payments become effective. Emergency and supplemental payments are another form of direct payments, but they are issued for different reasons. These reasons include offsetting financial strain caused by low prices, natural disasters, and severe weather that affects yields and prices. These payments are considered ad hoc and are authorized and implemented by Congress. Although these payments are considered ad hoc, they have become common since 1998, being paid in every year for a multitude of reasons and to far mers producing a variety of    Over the past eight years, the largest share of direct government farm payments has gone to commercial farms, as they are defined by ERS. Commercial farms are part of a secondary classification that was also developed by ERS. the majority of production, and the payments they do receive contribute the least of all to corresponding net farm income. Are these farms less reliant on the payments? With available data, it is difficult to observe much about these farms other than the fact that they account for most of the production in the country, they receive the greatest share of the subsidies, and that most of these far ms receive them  The authors note in 1944 that \"what is particularly needed is a segregation of farms into a few simple, distinct, and clearly recognizable classes, and a tabulation for each of these classes of such data as are needed for recognizing and understanding the problems relating to them\" (Benedict et al. 1944.). In order to do this, the authors felt that the parameters of the classification should differentiate by interests, behavior, and structure, depending on current conditions. Benedict et al. go on to foil the traditional idea of the \"average American farm\" _ by stating that the diversity of the sector and conditions under which it operates make the idea naive\ufffd They contend that national, omnibus farm programs tend to give some fanns undue advantages, while leaving others without the aid that they need. The authors assimilate this approach to a shotgun technique that never meets intended goals. The authors also recognize that there is no set group of measurements that can be used to identify and classify farms, and that any system of classification must be left to discretion; and the measurements used should be chosen to meet the intended goal. While they understand this, the authors note that \"some sort of compromise must therefore be made between the ideal of a highly detailed and realistic grouping and the very broad classifications which are now so generally used in public discussion\" (Benedict et al. 1944, 698-99). In their classification system, Benedict et al. use a system of breaking points to identify natural groups of farms. The measurement used by the authors is gross value of products. They identify five groups in their system that include: 1) Large-scale farms and plantations; 2) Family-commercial farms; 3) Part time farms; 4) Residential farms; and 5) Small scale farm s. This study laid the ground work for many future studies, and even the segregate farms based on the operating fami lies' reliance on them. This system included two major categories: commercial and noncommercial (Welsch and \u2022 Moore 1965). In the first essay, Hurley notes that \"classification has helped by grouping farms; without this grouping, most persons would be using averages in order to describe the \u2022 United States agriculture,\" however, \"in the era of the specializ.ation for agricultural production, the classification of farms by type may indicate more fundamental differences between groups of farms than the classification by economic class\" (Hurley 1965(Hurley , 1567. Welsch and Moore (1965) state that a major problem with the Census classification is that the economic classes of farms are too heterog . eneous to be able to ' trace any given target group over time. Although both papers agree that some sort of classification system is needed for American agriculture, they also indicate that traditional measurements have strengths and weaknesses, \ufffd further discussed later in the data section of this chapter. In 1974, the Census excluded the economic classification of farms from its reporting. Stanton (1984) states that this was due to the great technological advances in agriculture during the period, the volatility of prices, and the unresolved debate regarding parameters of classification. However, he too suggests that without a classification system, the layman would not comprehend the farm unit structural differences in the sector when looking at reported data. The next major recognized study on farm classification was conducted by Breimyer in 1978. This classification segregated farms into six unique categories: 1) smaller .than family size; 2) family size-open market; 3) larger than family size-open market; 4) cooperative; 5) contractually integrated; and 6) large corporations (Breimyer 1978). In the same year, the Congressional Budget Office introduced in their reporting another classification system that included part-time farmers (farms whose operator worked off farm more than 200 days per year), small scale farms (sales less than $20,000), family farms (those employing less than 1.5 people per year fr \ufffd m outside the family), larger than family farms (non-industrialized farms that employed more than 1.5 \u2022 gross product or sales citing that a gross value of either of these things fails to recognize efficiency of the farm. Their papers discuss alternative measurements and their usefulness. In addition to the common criticism of gross values, Hurley also points out that gross values do not account for amount of production consumed on farm, and that gross production only \u2022 considers one year that could easily have been affected by abnormalities in weather, prices, or yields. Welsch and Moore (1965) Hurley (1965) suggests that net farm income could be used, but the difficulty in collecting the data due to farmers' and data collectors' comprehension levels of the concept of net income, would be too much to overcome, especially when complex owner operator agreements exist throughout the sector. He also denounces acreage as a measure due to quality and land value divergences. The data collection problems are not unique to the United States. In the past decade, there has arisen a demand for congruent data among countries. As Boisvert notes, \"since the effects of domestic farm policy reform in many developed nations will likely resonate through the international markets for agricultural products ... it is imperative that countries agree on the common data needed to effect international comparisons\" (Boisvert 2002, 1-2). He also notes that the United States has the best data bank for agriculture in the world. that reveals the percentage of total value of production for the two categories are 8 .5%"}, {"section_title": "Lastly, a study conducted by", "text": "and 58.7% respectively.

Nevertheless, the latter five figures are often omitted by advocacy groups that decry current farm policy. The sec\ufffdnd shortcoming is partially related to the first. Wise warns against using . aggregate averages of farm income when analyzing farm households' financial health. Chapter ill: Data and Methods"}, {"section_title": "Available Sources", "text": "In order to derive a new classification system. for American farms, it will be necessary to evaluate currently operating farms and their characteristics. The best data available are a series of surveys conducted each year by the ERS and National Agriculture Statistics Service, the Agricultural Resource Management Survey. These data are used in this study. The survey is completed in three phases. Phase one is conducted in the summer of the reference year and is used as a screening tool to verify selected operations' operating status. If the farms are involved in production of target commodities for the given year, then they may be selected for inclusion in phase two, which is conducted in the fall and winter of the reference year. Phase two is similar to the previously used Cropping Practices Survey. This phase gathers data involving production practices and input use at the individual production unit level. Phase three is conducted in the spring following the reference year, and inquires about costs and returns, financial structure, and household variables ( e.g. number of family members employed by the fa rm, percentage of household income from the farm, etc. Phase three data are confidential, and attaining them requires completion of a project agreement, a memorandum of understanding among the researcher and their institution, ERS, and NASS, and an agreement of confidentiality among the afo rementioned parties. Even after these documents and agreements have been completed and satisfied, the data can only , be accessed in a state NASS office, and none of it can be taken off premises. Only approved summaries of the raw data are eligible_ for off premise use. Gaining access to this data was the largest stumbling block and learning experience associated wi\":1 the project. However, after multiple telephone conversations, email exchanges, and personal meetings, the data were accessed in the Tennessee state office, where it had\u2022 been made available by the National Agriculture Statistics Service's national headquarters. Another source of data that could be used is the Census of Agriculture, conducted by the National Agricultural Statistics Service. The census is a valuable resource for the type of data that will be used in the study. However, it is only administered once every five years. More critically for the purposes addressed here, these data are also reported only at the county level. 1bis study requires data from individual farm units, and therefore ARMS data are more appropriate. Using data aggregated to the county level would compromise the ability to reveal how individual farm s are affected by government subsidies."}, {"section_title": "Geographic Focus", "text": "The use of every state in the study would be the preferred method, but this would be too time consuming, as the study is very data intensive. This research is meant to provide a framework that future study can use to investigate other and larger sections of the country. Therefore, this study focuses on phase three ARMS data for two states: Iowa \u2022 and Tennessee. There are several reasons the two states are considered. Iowa is a state that traditionally produces program crops (i.e.\u2022 row crops) while Tennessee is a state where production is more diverse. Using these two contrasting states (production and practice and geographic location \ufffdonsidered) will depict cross sections of aggregate production. Another reason that Iowa and Tennessee were chosen is because the study is a joint project between the Agricultural Policy Analysis Center at the University of Tennessee and the Beginning Farmer Center at Iowa State University."}, {"section_title": "Data Employed", "text": "In order to investigate the role of government payments, the study employs several traditional means of measurement, with a few variations. Also, three focus years 1996, 2000, and 2003. The year 1996 was chosen because among the yearly data available, it was the year in which aggregate government payments was the lowest, at $7 .  Solvency classes were examined as they depict the financial situation of the fann across three variables and two time horizons. Net farm income is a reflection of the financial situation in a single year, while the debt to asset ratio is a better measure of an -operation's long run financial situation. Both variables that make up the solvency class criteria were examined separately and individually as well in order to more thoroughly examine them. However, these examinations were carried out after farms were segregated. Although the criteria for each solvency class are distinctive, their range is broad. For example, it is important in solvency class II to know exactly how deficient these farms are in net income. Knowing specific values for net farm income and debts to assets enables the study to compare them individually against government payments. The third classification variable chosen is the ratio of owned to rented land farmed by the operator, termed tenure in this analysis . . Upon segregating farms into solvency classes by tenure, the study investigated several other variables for differing reasons. Total value of government payments was chosen as it is central to the study. The\u2022 ultimate goal is to examine farm businesses' dependence on them. Total government payments associated with farms in the focus years were taken as they reflect the total for all programs for which a farm has qualified and been a participant. Because operators may choose which programs to take advantage of in any given year, disaggregating government payments may not capture the whole picture for a given farm. By using total government payments, the likelihood of including all payments received by each farm is increased. Value of crops produced was also examined as it is highly correlated with government payments due to the fact that most payments are calculated by incorporating crop production on some level, be it current or historical. Value of livestock produced was investigated to recognize other enterprises that the farms may be involved in. Acres operated is another variable considered by classification. Total debt was also examined separately from debt to asset ratio. Farm net worth was also considered. Finally, off farm income was chosen. It was chosen as a me3:sure of farm household financial health, but from other sources. Total household off farm income was used for years 1996 and 2000, but off farm income of the primary operator only was used for 2003, as this was the only year in the study that off farm income was separated in this manner. These variables cover a wide range of characteristics for farm businesses. Although they each have inherent strengths and weaknesses, they were chosen as the best fit for the study. Individually, they dissect farm operations satisfactorily for the study; and in concert, they provide a suitable overall picture of structural characteristics of agricultural enterprises, whether or not they play a large role in determining farm dependence on subsidies. Descriptive statistics for each variable in each year and state are available in Appendix A. It is important to note that immediately after the variables of interest were chosen, each observation was replicated in accordance with its expansion factor. This was necessary to reflect the true distribution of farms in each year and state, and omission of this step would invalidate any succeeding analysis. Table 3 denotes the number of expanded observations for each year and state."}, {"section_title": "Conceptual Framework", "text": "The premise of the study is to examine the reliance of farms on government payments in Iowa and Tennessee. To achieve this, the data must be segregated in a manner that ensures that all farms are accounted for only once and no farms are excluded. This is most easily accomplished through the isolated consideration of one variable of measurement. Upon selection of the primary variable of differentiation, the study employs Breimeyer' s idea of modal groups. By choosing only one variable as the initial criterion for segregation, the possibility of any single observation being omitted or counted more than once is eliminated. Afterward, each of the modal groups can be further inspected and segregated by other variables into groups that are homogeneous within and heterogeneous across groups. When this is completed, investigation of the groups will result in the ability to make justifiable statement concerning the reliance of farms in Iowa and Tennessee on government payments."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "To begrin the investigation, a series of trial and error was employed to ascertain the best variable to use for the primary segregation. The first variable of separation chosen was acres operated. The break points for the acreage modal groups entailed those farms operating less than 50 acres, farms operating 51-99 acres, farms operating 100-149 acres, farms operating 150-249 acres, farms operating 250-499 acres, farins operating 500-999 acres, and farms operating 1000 or more acres. This approach was quickly dismissed as it masked the fact that some farms re_ alize negative net farm incomes, even after government payments are accounted for. It is important to the study to highlight farms with negative net farm incomes. These farms are important to the study as they provide understanding of vulnerability. Farms with negative net income are represented_ in solvency classes II and IV, as shown in Appendix B. No business can continue operation indefinitely with negative net income, and farms that face this year after year must eventually leave the industry. The second : approach involved a two step process. The first step was to heed Wise's advice and make an attempt to exclude farms that would skew an otherwise judicious examination. This involved the inclusion of farms on the condition that they produced more than $1000 in crop receipts. After this was done, the remaining farms were segregated by solvency class. Separating farms this way ensured that those earning negative net farm income would surface. Next, each of the solvency groups was sorted by tenure. This was done to highlight the relationship of owned -land to financial health. The tenure groups were separated by quartile. "}, {"section_title": "Chapter III: Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Classification System", "text": "Before reporting the results of the analysis, it is important to note the distribution of various characteristics of farms by the classification system. By concentrating only on those operations that produce more than $1,000 in crops it becomes clear that Iowa retains a much higher percentage of total farms than Tennessee. Table 4 depicts aggregate numbers for both states across years, and the number of observations retained when farms producing less than $1,000 in crop are excluded. Table 4 reinforces the idea that the two states' agricultural sectors are very different. Iowa farms are _more concentrated in crop production ( over the three years, an average of almost two-thirds of the farms produce more than $1,000 in crops); whereas in Tennessee, the distribution is much different (averaging less thanone-quarter of farms producing more than $1,000 in crop production). Because the study focuses on government payment .reliance associated with crop production, reflecting the current distribution criteria, farms that do not produce more than $1,000 in crops are omitted \u2022 because they would skew the data, especially in Tennessee. By dividing the data by solvency classes, one observes that most farms fall into solvency class one (i.e. have positive net farm income and a debt to asset ratio of less than 0.40). Figures 7-9 show the distribution of farms by solvency class for each year and state.    Figure 10.

Viewed this way it is observed that no real trend exists between value of government payments and percentage of land owned by the operator. However, in 2000, for those farm s whose operators owned less than 50% of the land operated, government payments were the difference between positive and negative net farm income (Figures 18-23). Also, concerning land ownership in the two states, operators in Iowa tend to own a much smaller portion of the land they operate (Figure 24). Also, the study found that the value of crops produced is inversely proportionate to the percentage of operated land owned by the operator (Figure 25).   $45,000 --------------.  $40, 000 ------------i  $35,000 +--------,  $30 , 000 +------,  I!? $25,000  .!! $20 ,000 ----0 $15, 000 ---c $10 , 000  $5,000  $0  -$5,000 +-------------I  -$10 I 000 -+-----,-----,--- +--,J-'---,-------,-11-- 8 0 --.---------------------------- 1996,2000,2003 It appears in Tennessee, in each year, by land ownership ru:rangement, that irrespective of government payments, those farm s that own between 25% and 50% of the land operated have net farm incomes that are significantly higher than all other categories. The best explanation found for this trend is that this category in Tennessee encompassed a much smaller number of expanded farm s, and that at least one of those farm s, unexpanded realized significantly high net income in each year, which would have skewed the resulting average net farm income in the years."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Vulnerability Concerning Government Payments", "text": "After subtracting government payments from net farm income and reassigning observations to solvency classes, not much changed. However, when noticeable changes did occur, they were significant. By the nature of the manipulation, the only thing that could result would be shifts between solvency classes one and. two or between solvency classes three and four. This is due to the fact that the transformation only affected net fann income, which makes up only half the criteria for solvency class determination, the other half being debt-to-asset ratio, which was assumed to remain constant.

By using solvency classes, it was possible to highlight farms with negative net incomes, and also consider solvency, which is a measure that accounts for decisions made over a multi-year time horizon. These measures were chosen because they encompass both long term and short term decision making practices of farm operators. Net farm income reflects short term decision maki ng , as it changes every year due to, among other things, variable costs, and planting decisions. Solvency is an indicator that includes considerations for long term investments, both as debts and assets. Including only those far ms that produce more than $1,000 in crops in the study was a large determinant, as it omitted a much higher percentage of farms in Tennessee. However, since most government subsidies are distributed to those farms that produce program crops, inclusion of farms that do not have significant crop production would have presented problems when the means of the variables of interest were calculated. This would have been most apparent in Tennessee, as retention rates in the state were under thirty percent in every year, whereas in Iowa, omission of those fanns excluded only between 41 % and 27% in any given year. Also, the study reinforced the initial idea that the firms that make up the agricultural sectors in Iowa and Tennessee are structurally different. Consideration of the descriptive statistics for the variables of interest in the two states show that, on average, Iowa farms operate more acreage and produce more crops. As a result, the average amount of government payments received by operators in Iowa is higher than Tennessee m every year. Again, this is because most subsidies are tied to production of program crops. Overall, the study found that the maj ority of fanns in Iowa and Tennessee have debt-to-asset ratios below 0.40. These farms make up solvency classes I and II. Of those farms that represent solvency classes I and II, the majority of those fanns have positive net farm incomes (solvency class I). By investigating farms by solvency class, it was found that for farms in Iowa, government payments play a larger role in financial health of the farm than in Tennessee, and that, depending on the year, government payments were the difference in many farms' ability to realize positive incomes. This was the most prevalent in 2000. In other years, however, government payments made up a significant portion of net farm income, and depending on the fi nancial situation of farms in a given state and year, the absence of government payments affected considerably the number of farms identified as financially solvent. Also, absence of government payments shifted a significant number of farms from what is labeled as marginally solvent (solvency class III) to financially vulnerable (solvency class IV), which are the farms that have debt-to-asset ratios of above 0.40 for both classes. This shift represents a change from \u2022 positive to negative net fann income. Although negative ne: t farm income in a year will not drive an operator out of business, the combination of negative net fann income and high debt-to-asset ratio is a situation that a fanner must consider when m \ufffd ng long term decisions. It would be impossible for any enterprise to continue operation for an extended period under these circumstances. This .is important knowledge as it reveals that government subsides to the fann sector do affect the financial health and vulnerability o [ farm enterprises and that the subsidies do not represent a mere added profit to the balance sheet of the most profitable farms. This research was designed to be the beginning of a larger body of work concerning government payments and their distribution. As debates for the 2007 farm bill ( and legislation beyond) continue, any information concerning subsidies' contribution and distribution is valuable. This study will be helpful in showing just how government payments affect farm incomes based on solvency classes and ownership/operation arrangements in two states that have very different agricultural industries. Also, the development of this classification system may provide a tool with which to better understand farm subsidies' role in financial characteristics on an aggregate level."}, {"section_title": "Limitations of the Study", "text": "Although this study uses data that are meant to represent the agricultural sector in the United States, it is important to recognize that no two farm enterprises are the same. This presents problems when aggregating the data to any extent. What was found in the data across all years and states is that the variance of all variables was extremely high. This presents problems when performing analysis. However, that is the nature of the \u2022 data, and the variance represents the diversity of the sector. There is no justifiable way to adjust for the variance in the data without skewing the results, so the data were unadjusted. Also, by design, the ARMS data only focuses on selected commodities each year. By focusing on a limited set of commodities each year, the likelihood of reporting . data that is truly representative of all farm s is diminished. This is because farms that produce similar commodities are likely to have similar cost and return structures, depending on their size. Although the data presented limitations to the study, they are prepared with great care to be as representative as possible. ERS and NASS collect as much data as resources allow in every year, and utilize sophisticated statistical measures to ensure that the data are expanded properly to be representative of all farm operations in the United States. However, the survey used to collect the data only included between 275 and 304 unexpanded farm s in any given year and state. Although efforts are applied to make these data representative of all farm s in the given state, by expanding approximately 300 far ms to 90,000, each fa rm represents, on average, 300 farms. As a result, some of the observations in a given category of classification represented a significant percentage of the whole category; and movement between categories as a result of modifying net farm income in some cases may over emphasize the effect. ARMS data were the best available for the purposes of the study, but due to expansion issues, the extent to which the study presents a true representation of the sector in each state is questionable. Lastly, the study did not incorporate rental rates for those far ms that did not own all the land they operated. Although direct payments are set before the growing season in any given year,.they are only one element affecting farm income in a given year. Many of the factors that affect income are revealed throughout and after the growing season, such as_ input prices, weather, and market prices. \u2022 The year 2000 emphasizes the caution farmers should exercise when calculating expected returns a priori, and making decisions based on those expectations. Although data used in this study preclude any explicit exploration of the effects of \u2022 land rental rates, other studies have shown that there is a correlation between the rental price of a given parcel of land and its associated direct payment (ERS 2005d, Roberts 2004). Because the direct payment for land is known before the land is leased, the owner of the land is able to consider it when determining the price per acre to the lessee, and realize economic rent. This practice _ drives the rental price of the land up, and therefore diminishes the ultimate profit for the operator on the land, irrespective of other subsidy programs by which the operator may receive benefits."}, {"section_title": "Policy Implications", "text": "As future agricultural policy is discussed for the United States, it is important for policy makers understand the role of government payments in the financial and structural characteristics of farm enterprises. By showing explicitly the relationship of government payments and net farm income and solvency class of farms in Iowa and Tennessee, this study will aid in that endeavor. Current federal agricultural subsidies are designed to support farmers' incomes. One consideration that should be recognized is that ownership of farmland is an important factor in assessing commodity policy, and that ownership arrangements affect the amount of support that an operator receives. As some subsidies can be calculated before the tractor arrives to till the field, if the operator does not own the land he/she operates, there is a good chance that at least a portion of the subsidies he/she will receive will be transferred to the land owner. Decoupled payments should be scrutinized as many times, absentee landlords receive support based only on the fact that they own the land farmed. Also, adjusting loan rates only when farm bills are developed (roughly every five years) is a long time horizon. As agriculture continues to become \u2022 a global industry, there are an increasing number of issues that can affect annual prices of commodities. There may be merit in considering more frequent loan rate adjustments to reflect changing market conditions in a timely manner."}, {"section_title": "Recommendations For Future Work", "text": "Since the inception of this study, it has been considered a building block for a more broad understanding of the interaction of government payments in the farm sector. This small piece of literature explores only one facet of the influence of payments on farm enterprises: net farm income. The ultimate goal of the series of studies is to understand how government payments affect farm operations on a requisite level that includes all aspects\u2022 of the operation. Several possibilities exist for future work regarding this study. Initially, the study could be expanded to consider every state. As this study shows, the face of agriculture varies widely from state to state. To better understand the role of government payments on an aggregate level, it would be useful to replicate the study for every state. Another possibility would be to examine rental arrangements for those enterprises that do not m\ufffd all the land involved in production. Because government payments can influence rental rates, it would be valuable to know exactly how much operators pay to lease the land they operate. This would not be an easy task, if even possible; as there are many different types of rental arrangements and there is no requirement to report to anyone a particular arrangement between owner and operator. Another possibility for future work could include simulations. By design, this study did not account for the fact that government payments affect decision making for operators of farms. If it were possible to simulate decision making concerning enterprise mix and other structural characteristics associated with the absence of government payments then it would shed better light on a broader range of the effects of government payment abolishment. Due to the time constraints of this study, however, this was not possible in this research. Lastly, related to the aforementioned recommendation, it would be valuable to reassess debt-to-asset ratios in the absence of government payments. However, since this ratio is affected by government payments (through decision making), it is difficult to judge augmented debt-to-asset ratios within the confines of this study. Because the study looked only at the change in net farm income, debt-to-asset ratios were held constant. By running a simulation, changes in decision making concerning debt loads and asset investment could be considered. "}]
