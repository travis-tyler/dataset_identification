[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The alkenone paleotemperature proxy is one of the most widely used methods for estimating sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in paleoceanography. The proxy is based on the relative unsaturation of long-chain (C 37 ) ketone lipids (alkenones) produced by haptophyte algae like Emiliana huxleyi (Brassell et al., 1986;Marlowe et al., 1984;Volkman et al., 1980). Unsaturation decreases with increasing temperature, consistent with a homeoviscous adaptation, although alkenones are presumed to be energy storage molecules and not membrane lipids (Epstein et al., 2001). Haptophytes produce alkenones with 37, 38, and 39 carbons and all demonstrably change in response to water temperature, but the C 37 group is traditionally targeted for paleoceanographic applications. The relative unsaturation of these compounds is represented mathematically by the U K 37 and U K \u2032 37 indices: (1) Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology"}, {"section_title": "10.1002/2017PA003201", "text": "In the past 30 years, the alkenone paleothermometer has been repeatedly calibrated, validated, and examined for sensitivity to nonthermal effects such as light and nutrient stress (Prahl et al., 2003), degradation (Hoefs et al., 1998;Prahl, De Lange et al., 1989), and lateral advection (Mollenhauer et al., 2003;R\u00fchlemann & Butzin, 2006). Although these secondary influences on U K \u2032 37 are nonnegligible in some locations, they are difficult to detect on a global scale (Herbert, 2001;2003). Importantly, the sensitivity of U K \u2032 37 to temperature has been confirmed by laboratory culturing of Emiliana huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa oceanica, the dominant producers of alkenones in the modern ocean (Conte et al., 1998;Prahl & Wakeham, 1987;Prahl et al., 1988;Sawada et al., 1996;Volkman et al., 1995). Although some strain-dependent differences exist, these experiments generally indicate a U K \u2032 37 sensitivity close to the empirical values derived from regressing core-top U K \u2032 37 against observed SSTs (Herbert, 2001;M\u00fcller et al., 1998;Sikes et al., 1991). This agreement confirms that the alkenone paleothermometer is a robust indicator for SSTs or very near-surface (upper mixed layer) ocean temperatures. In spite of decades of research, unanswered questions regarding calibration of the alkenone paleothermometer remain and may pose serious issues for estimation in certain regions or time periods. One concern is the relatively recent appearance of E. huxleyi in the fossil record (\u223c290 ka, Raffi et al., 2006;Thierstein et al., 1977), which dominates alkenone production in the modern ocean. Likewise, the second-most important producer, G. oceanica, only appears in the Pliocene (present at 3.5 Ma, abundant at 1.7 Ma, Raffi et al., 2006, Samtleben, 1980. Prior to the evolution of G. oceanica, alkenones are still abundant in sediments but were presumably produced by now-extinct relatives (Marlowe et al., 1990). Therefore, temperature estimation before the mid-Pliocene necessarily relies on the assumption that the U K \u2032 37 sensitivity to seawater temperature is the same as today. However, a similar assumption must be made for nonextant species of planktic foraminifera (Zachos et al., 1994), so this is a common and particularly intractable problem in paleoceanography that is not unique to U K \u2032 37 . More tractable problems regarding U K \u2032 37 calibration include the seasonality of production and the potential for nonlinear temperature sensitivity at the low and high ends of the calibration range. Sediment trap studies demonstrate that alkenone production varies strongly throughout the annual cycle in most regions, with factors such as temperature, nutrients, stratification, and competition regulating the timing of haptophyte blooms (Rosell-Mel\u00e9 & Prahl, 2013). In the subtropics and midlatitudes, production is typically skewed toward spring, following nutrient entrainment from late winter and spring mixing (Prahl et al., 1993;Richey & Tierney, 2016). In the high latitudes, blooms occur during summer or fall as light availability and competition with other phytoplankton play a role (Rosell-Mel\u00e9 & Prahl, 2013;Seki et al., 2007;Sikes et al., 2005;Thomsen et al., 1998). In the Mediterranean, production occurs throughout the fall and spring and is low during the warm, stratified summer season (Ternois et al., 1996). It is still unclear how, or whether, seasonal bias in production affects sedimentary U K \u2032 37 , which is typically calibrated to mean annual temperatures. Some sediment trap studies note that core-top sediments below the trap site appear to reflect annual SST in spite of seasonal variability, suggesting that there is some attenuation and averaging of the seasonal signals occurring during the export process (e.g., M\u00fcller & Fischer, 2001). Mean annual SST also appears to be a defensible choice for calibrating existing core-top data sets (Conte et al., 2006;M\u00fcller et al., 1998) suggesting that seasonal bias may not be large enough to affect alkenone signatures on a global scale. On the other hand, close investigation of residual patterns that emerge after calibrating to mean annual SST suggests that U K \u2032 37 -based estimates may be seasonally biased in some regions, in particular, the high latitudes (Prahl et al., 2010;Rosell-Mel\u00e9 & Prahl, 2013). The linearity of the U K \u2032 37 response to SST is also an unresolved issue. Prahl et al. (1988) cultured E. huxleyi at five temperatures and found that a constant slope (0.034 U K \u2032 37 units per degrees Celsius) described the relationship between U K \u2032 37 and temperature from 8 \u2218 C to 25 \u2218 C well. However, a study of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the Southern Ocean indicated that the response of unsaturation to temperature is nonlinear at cold temperatures (Sikes & Volkman, 1993). A later culturing study of multiple strains of haptophytes observed slope attenuation below 12 \u2218 C and above 24 \u2218 C, suggesting that the temperature sensitivity of U K \u2032 37 follows a sigmoidal curve (Conte et al., 1998). Further support for slope attenuation at low and high temperatures comes from an SPM study in the North Atlantic (Sicre et al., 2002) and sediment trap studies in warm waters (Go\u00f1i et al., 2001;Richey & Tierney, 2016), which observed clear reductions in the sensitivity of U K \u2032 37 to SST at temperatures below 6 \u2218 C and above 24 \u2218 C, respectively. As is the case with seasonality of production, it is unclear how much these observations of nonlinearity affect the global calibration of U K \u2032 37 . Existing core-top calibrations have found that a constant slope fits the data sufficiently (Conte et al., 2006;M\u00fcller et al., 1998;Sikes et al., 1991), and some argue that \"warm end\" attenuation is small and/or not statistically significant 10.1002/2017PA003201 (Kienast et al., 2012;Pelejero & Grimalt, 1997). However, Conte et al. (2006) proposed a nonlinear calibration for a global U K \u2032 37 SPM data set, and Sonzogni et al. (1997) proposed a reduced slope (0.023) for U K \u2032 37 calibration in the tropical Indian Ocean. In what follows, we first reexamine the alkenone paleothermometer with an extended and updated core-top data set, with an emphasis on resolving issues regarding seasonality and nonlinearity. Next, we introduce a Bayesian U K \u2032 37 calibration model that addresses attenuation at high SSTs and provides a probabilistic method for propagating uncertainties in the U K \u2032 37 calibration through to paleoclimatic reconstruction-an aspect critical for multiproxy inference, model-data comparisons, and data assimilation (e.g., Annan & Hargreaves, 2013;Steiger & Hakim, 2016;Tingley et al., 2012). We then assess the performance of this new calibration by applying it to published U K \u2032 37 records and comparing results with previous calibrations as well as independent proxies for SST. Finally, we discuss how our new U K \u2032 37 calibration affects paleoceanographic interpretations, particularly in the tropical oceans.\nIn this IPWP compilation, U K \u2032 37 and Mg/Ca-18 O are represented equally, making the comparison between these two proxy systems especially apt. BAYSPLINE U K \u2032 37 estimates show greater variance than those derived from Mg/Ca-18 O (Figure 9b), both because the U K \u2032 37 sites span a greater range of apparent temperatures, and the uncertainties in the BAYSPLINE calibration are larger at the warm end. On the other hand, the Mg/Ca-18 O regression does not fully propagate uncertainties, so the confidence intervals are likely too small. The LGM TEX 86 estimate is also more constrained than that of U K \u2032 37 (Figure 9b), but this is because there are only five TEX 86 sites available (Figure 9a and see Table S1). This LGM exercise demonstrates that BAYSPLINE produces similar temperature estimates in the tropics as other geochemical proxies. In contrast, the M\u00fcller et al. (1998) calibration predicts a cooling that does not overlap with the TEX 86 estimates at all and has a low probability (10%) of being consistent with the Mg/Ca-18 O estimates (Figure 9b). This highlights the fact that the most widely used U K \u2032 37 calibrations (M\u00fcller et al., 1998;Prahl et al., 1988) underestimate tropical temperature anomalies by about 40%.

We also analyzed U K \u2032 37 in 132 additional core tops to increase spatial coverage. The complete core-top data set is available as a Data Set S1 in the supporting information. The laboratory methodology for the new analyses is described in the subsequent subsection. In total, our compilation contains 1,344 core tops distributed across the modern ocean ( Figure 1). U K \u2032 37 values in the core-top data set span 0.033-1, covering nearly all of the possible range (0-1). A U K \u2032 37 value of 1 indicates that the C 37\u22363 compound is undetectable via conventional gas chromatographic techniques and therefore is assigned a peak area of zero. Some have argued that U K \u2032 37 values of 1 be excluded from calibration exercises because there is both technical and interpretive ambiguity in the assignment of a value of zero to C 37\u22363 (Pelejero & Calvo, 2003). However, our opinion is that these values must be retained, because they represent a source of user error and interpretation that we seek to capture in our assessment of error variance. Practically speaking, there are only 19 values in our data set with U K \u2032 37 =1, and so their inclusion has a negligible impact on our results (inferred regression coefficients differ by a maximum of 5%). To calibrate the U K \u2032 37 data, we use instrumental SST observations from the 0.25 \u2218 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) gridded product, based on a combination of ship, buoy, and satellite (advanced very high resolution radiometer) observations (Banzon et al., 2016). This product provides daily SSTs from 1981 to present. We chose OISST due to its superior coverage near the coastlines, where many of the U K \u2032 37 core tops are found (Figure 1). Our results are not sensitive to this choice of SST product; regression coefficients and predicted SSTs using the 1 \u2218 World Ocean Atlas 13 data product (Locarnini et al., 2013) are virtually identical (not shown). For our purposes, we use the mean 37 values versus observed sea surface temperature (Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature, Banzon et al., 2016). Red points denote new data generated as a part of this study (N = 132). annual and monthly climatologies of the OISST product. Estimated standard errors for the OISST climatologies are small (fractions of a degree) so are not explicitly included in our analysis. SST and U K \u2032 37 observations are paired using minimum chordal distances (after Tierney & Tingley, 2014). The U K \u2032 37 data sample a wide range of modern SSTs from \u22120.4 to 29.6 \u2218 C (Figure 1). Prior to calculating any correlations or regressions, paired U K \u2032 37 -SST values from the anomalous Brazil-Malvinas and Arctic regions were removed (see sections 3 and 4 below) and U K \u2032 37 values from the same OISST grid point were averaged to avoid spatial overrepresentation. This results in an effective core top N = 1137."}, {"section_title": "Analytical Methods for New U K \u2032", "text": "37 Core Tops We sampled 1-2 cm of sedimentary material from the top (e.g., 0-1 and 0-2) or, if upper sediments were unavailable, the near top (in most cases, upper 10 cm) of 132 sediment cores stored at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Seafloor Samples Repository. The 123 of 132 of these cores were box cores, multicores, or gravity cores, ensuring that the uppermost sediment is most likely recent (e.g., late Holocene) in age. Many of these sediments were subject to investigation in other core-top-based studies, verifying their utility for modern calibration study (e.g., Dekens et al., 2002;Lear et al., 2002). The remaining 10 samples were piston cores, where loss of the uppermost sediment due to the coring process is likely. To mitigate the possibility of sampling old (in particular, glacial) sediments, we specifically targeted piston cores that had confirmed Holocene sediments from previous investigations in the published literature. Thus, we are confident that our core-top sediments are at least Holocene in age, during which time temperature variations were minimal relative to the range of the calibration data set (i.e., on the order of a couple of degrees). It should be noted that the problem of \"ambiguous modernity\" afflicts the entire core-top U K \u2032 37 data set and that we do not have specific information regarding the age of each core top. This uncertainty undoubtedly contributes to the error variance of the calibration. Sediment samples were freeze-dried and homogenized, and then \u223c5-10 g of material was extracted with an accelerated solvent extraction 350 system at a temperature of 100 \u2218 C and maximum pressure of 10,342 kPa. If necessary, the resulting total lipid extracts (TLEs) were run through a short column of sodium sulfate to remove any interstitial seawater released during the extraction process. TLEs were then evaporated to dryness and purified using two column chromatography steps. First, neutral, acid, and polar fractions were separated over LC-NH 2 gel using dichloromethane:isopropanol (2:1), 4% acetic acid in dichloromethane, and methanol as the respective eluents. Next, the neutral and polar fractions were recombined, then further purified over 5% deactivated silica gel using hexane, dichloromethane, and methanol as eluents. The dichloromethane fraction, containing the alkenones, was redissolved in ethyl acetate in preparation for analysis by gas chromatography. Alkenones were detected and quantified on a Trace 1310 gas chromatograph equipped with a DB-1 column (60 m \u00d7 0.32 mm \u00d7 0.1 \u03bcm) and a programmable temperature vaporization (PTV) injector. The PTV was operated in splitless mode (splitless time: 3 min) with a program of: 60 \u2218 C (held 0.1 min) to 325 \u2218 C at 5 \u2218 C/s, and a ramped pressure from 14.5 psi to 33.6 psi. The gas chromatograph oven program (total runtime: 70 min) was: 60 \u2218 C (held 2 min) to 270 \u2218 C at 30 \u2218 C/min, then to 310 \u2218 C at 1 \u2218 C/min (hold 1 min), then to 325 \u2218 C at 10 \u2218 C/min (hold 18.50 min). Alkenones were identified via comparison of retention times to internal laboratory standards.  Figure 2.

The precision (1 ) of the U K \u2032 37 values was 0.002 units based on repeat measurements of a laboratory sediment standard."}, {"section_title": "Data Exploration: Residual Trends, Seasonality, and Nonlinearity", "text": "To investigate spatially varying trends in the U K \u2032 37 -temperature response, we applied the linear culture calibration of Prahl et al. (1988) (U K \u2032 37 = 0.034 \u22c5 T + 0.039, with T = mean annual SST), to the calibration data set and examined the residuals. We choose this calibration as our baseline for comparison because it (1) is \"theoretical\" in the sense that is based on controlled laboratory cultures, (2) was explicitly recommended for paleoceanographic application by the alkenone community in 2000 (Prahl et al., 2000), and (3) is not significantly different from the core-top-based calibration of M\u00fcller et al. (1998), which is commonly applied to U K \u2032 37 data. Thus, we can consider areas of large residual values as regions where U K \u2032 37 behavior deviates from this theoretical expectation. In the current data set, there are three areas with very large (\u223c5 \u2218 C) residuals: the Nordic Seas, the Labrador Sea, and a small zone at the confluence of the Brazil and Malvinas currents ( Figure 2). Previous studies have identified these regions as problematic for alkenone paleothermometry (Bendle & Rosell-Mel\u00e9, 2004;Benthien & M\u00fcller, 2000;Conte et al., 2006;Filippova et al., 2016;R\u00fchlemann & Butzin, 2006). The anomalously low U K \u2032 37 values in the Brazil-Malvinas region are attributed to lateral advection of alkenones generated in the cold waters south of the front (Benthien & M\u00fcller, 2000;Conte et al., 2006;R\u00fchlemann & Butzin, 2006). Likewise, the anomalously high U K \u2032 37 values found in the Nordic and Labrador Seas are located near frontal SST boundaries and thus could indicate lateral advection of alkenones from warmer waters to the south (Bendle & Rosell-Mel\u00e9, 2004). However, the absolute U K \u2032 37 values at some of these locations are similar to those found in subtropical waters (\u223c0.5-0.7), indicating either very far field advection or that another process is influencing alkenone unsaturation. Filippova et al. (2016) observed that although sea ice intensity is not correlated with U K \u2032 37 residuals in the high-latitude North Atlantic, nearly all of the samples with higher U K \u2032 37 values than expected are from locations with some sea ice cover. Indeed, we find that the most positive residuals in the Norwegian and Labrador Seas generally, although not exclusively, fall within areas with at least 5% annual ice cover ( Figure 2a) and that there is a significant correlation between U K \u2032 37 residuals and the percentage of annual sea ice cover (Spearman's = 0.52, p < 0.0001). This suggests an unknown ecophysiological impact on alkenone unsaturation in areas with seasonal sea ice. residuals (observed U K \u2032 37 -predicted U K \u2032 37 , converted to temperature units by dividing by the slope) when applying the Prahl et al.

In doing so, we preclude the application of the alkenone paleothermometer in these regions. Although alternate alkenone indices show some promise in the Nordic Seas (Bendle & Rosell-Mel\u00e9, 2004;Rosell-Mel\u00e9, 1998), our concern here is with U K \u2032 37 , which interestingly, like the other lipid-based paleothermometer TEX 86 , fails to reflect temperatures in the cold, high-latitude Arctic (Ho et al., 2014;Kim et al., 2010;Tierney & Tingley, 2014). As with TEX 86 , U K \u2032 37 performs adequately in the cold Southern Ocean, suggesting that this is not a thermal limitation of the proxy but rather the presence of confounding influences in the Arctic region. With the data from the Brazil-Malvinas confluence and Arctic regions removed, global residuals calculated from the Prahl et al. (1988) calibration are much more uniform, but there are still regions and temperatures for which distinct patterns can be observed (Figure 3). In particular, both the North Atlantic and North Pacific regions have positive residuals, resulting in a significant negative correlation between residual U K \u2032 37 and temperature between \u223c7 and 10 \u2218 C (Figure 3b). It is also clear that core tops in the Mediterranean and Black Sea have consistently lower U K \u2032 37 than expected ( Figure 3c). U K \u2032 37 in the southeast Pacific is anomalously high  37 core tops in the North Atlantic (area north of 48 \u2218 N excluding the Labrador and North Seas); North Pacific (area north of 45 \u2218 N in the western region and 52.5 \u2218 N in the eastern region), and Mediterranean (including the Black Sea), respectively.

Other data from the core-top data set are plotted in gray, and the black line denotes the Prahl et al. (1988) regression. (Figure 3c). Finally, while not visually apparent in the spatial distribution of residuals (Figure 3c), there is a strong negative correlation between residual U K \u2032 37 and SST above 24 \u2218 C (Figure 3b). The residual patterns in the northern latitudes and the Mediterranean may be expressions of a seasonal influence on core-top U K \u2032 37 . These regions experience a large range of SSTs through the annual cycle (4-14 \u2218 C), and haptophyte blooms tend to be seasonally restricted (Rosell-Mel\u00e9 & Prahl, 2013;Seki et al., 2007;Ternois et al., 1997;Thomsen et al., 1998). Thus, the potential for a seasonal bias in sedimentary U K \u2032 37 is high. To empirically assess seasonal bias in these areas, we investigated month-by-month correlations between regional U K \u2032 37 and SSTs (Figures 4a-4c). For all three regions, there is a clear seasonal pattern in correlation, with a low probability that maximum and minimum correlation values are the same (Figures 4a-4c). For the North Atlantic and North Pacific, the data suggest that core-top U K \u2032 37 best reflects SSTs from August-October and June-August, respectively (Figures 4a and 4b). This empirical finding largely agrees with sediment trap evidence of alkenone production patterns in these regions, which indicate maximum flux during summer and fall (Rosell-Mel\u00e9 & Prahl, 2013;Seki et al., 2007;Thomsen et al., 1998). The Mediterranean U K \u2032 37 data have high correlations with November-May SSTs (Figure 4c), in agreement with sediment trap data that indicate maximum alkenone flux in fall and spring (Ternois et al., 1997). However, changes in the depth of production may also be a factor; in a study of upper water column SPM from the northwestern Mediterranean, Ternois et al. (1996) observed maximum alkenone concentrations from 20 to 50 m during fall and spring but from 50 to 70 m during the summer months, which is at or just below the shallow thermocline. A cooler summer signal combined with a upper mixed layer signal from the winter months would result in lower-than-expected sedimentary U K \u2032 37 . To investigate whether calibration to deeper-water temperatures could explain the Mediterranean U K \u2032 37 distributions, we compared U K \u2032 37 values to mean annual temperatures from different depths, derived from the World Ocean Atlas 2013 product (Locarnini et al., 2013). We found that maximum correlations occurred when U K \u2032 37 was regressed against temperatures from 65 to 100 m depth (not shown); however, the value ( = 0.68) was not statistically different from the correlation with SSTs ( = 0.56, p = 0.53). Therefore, from an empirical perspective winter-spring production is the best explanation for the negative U K \u2032 37 residuals in the Mediterranean. The southeast Pacific core-top data also show consistently high U K \u2032 37 residuals ( Figure 3c); however, the authors of the study from which these data derive suspect preferential degradation of the C 37\u22363 in this region (leading to artifically high U K \u2032 37 ), as alkenone concentrations are low and there is independent biomarker evidence for extensive sedimentary organic matter degradation (Jaeschke et al., 2017). Our analysis supports a nonseasonal origin for a U K \u2032 37 bias in this region, as we do not observe increases in correlation by month or season (not shown). We also note the large negative residuals in the North Pacific (Figure 3c). This feature is also likely to have a sedimentary, rather than seasonal origin: sedimentation rates are very low at this location (on the order of millimeters per kiloannum), and thus, glacial (cooler) alkenones could have been mixed into the core-top samples. The negative trend in residuals above \u223c24 \u2218 C suggests a nonlinear response of U K \u2032 37 to temperature above this threshold. As discussed in section 1, nonlinearity at the high end of the U K \u2032 37 calibration has long been suspected and is evident in water column and sediment trap studies (Go\u00f1i et al., 2001;Richey & Tierney, 2016;Sikes & Volkman, 1993). To more directly assess whether the global core-top data set shows evidence of slope attenuation, we conducted piecewise regression in 5 \u2218 C bins spanning 3-30 \u2218 C (data between 0 and 3 \u2218 C were excluded due to the low number of core-top samples). In agreement with the pattern in the residuals, slope attenuation is visually apparent above 24 \u2218 C (Figure 5a). While the slope remains within uncertainty of the Prahl culture expectation between 3 and 23 \u2218 C, it drops sharply at higher temperatures, reaching a 25% reduction around 25 \u2218 and 50% reduction around 27 \u2218 (Figure 5b). This slope reduction is statistically significant (p < 0.05) from 24 \u2218 upward. Large N at the high end of the calibration range gives confidence in the regression coefficients and confirms that this attenuation is not an artifact of data availability (Figure 5b). Interestingly, we find no evidence of significant slope attenuation at the low end of the calibration, in spite of the fact that reduced sensitivity may be expected from culture results (Conte et al., 1998) as well as analyses of SPM (Conte et al., 2006;Sikes & Volkman, 1993). However, there are a limited number of core tops available between 0 and 5 \u2218 (outside of the \"sea ice zone,\" N = 34) leading to large uncertainty in determination of the regression coefficients in our lowest bin of 3-8 \u2218 (Figure 5b). Thus, it is possible that current sampling of cold water locations is not sufficient to detect slope attenuation.\n10.1002/2017PA003201  Figure 7. Example applications of BAYSPLINE to U K \u2032 37 data from (a) the Gulf of Aden (Tierney et al., 2016) and (b) the Gulf of Alaska (Praetorius et al., 2015). Blue lines represent results given different prior standard deviations. Light blue error bars represent 1 uncertainties for a prior standard deviation of 10 \u2218 C. Solid black line shows sea surface temperatures (SSTs) inferred from the Prahl et al. (1988) calibration, and dotted black line shows SSTs inferred from the Sonzogni et al. (1997) calibration (Gulf of Aden only). Yellow dot and orange dot with error bars represent the median and 1 range of modern mean annual and July-August SSTs, respectively, at each core location. One of the advantages of BAYSPLINE is that the calibration error is propagated into the calculation of SSTs and changes dynamically depending on the slope of the spline curve. In the Gulf of Aden example, the 1 error on the warm Late Holocene estimates is 3.2 \u2218 C, whereas the error during the cooler LGM is 2.4 \u2218 C. These errors are larger than those associated with previous calibrations, but realistic considering that they account for slope attenuation, uncertainties in regression parameter estimation, and the variance in global core-top data. When we apply BAYSPLINE to data from the Gulf of Alaska (Praetorius et al., 2015), the 1 error drops accordingly (to 1.4 \u2218 C) as the slope increases to 0.034 (Figure 7b). In addition, there is virtually no sensitivity to the prior standard deviation choice at the low-to middle-range values of U K \u2032 37 found at this site, unless it is set to a quantity far lower than the standard deviation of the time series (e.g., 2 \u2218 C; not shown). The low error and insensitivity to the prior indicate a dominance of the regression model likelihood whenever U K \u2032 37 is below a value of \u223c0.86 (roughly equivalent to 24 \u2218 C). The Gulf of Alaska sits within the zone of the North Pacific in  Figure 8. BAYSPLINE-U K \u2032 37 winter sea surface temperatures (SSTs) (with 1 error bars) from two cores from the Tyrrhenian Sea (Mediterranean) (Cacho et al., 2001). Orange dot with error bar represents the median and 1 range of modern November-May SSTs at the location of these cores. BP = before present. which U K \u2032 37 preferentially records summer temperatures ( Figure 4) and BAYSPLINE is set to explicitly predict June-August SSTs. Modern summer SSTs are slightly higher than the median predictions by BAYSPLINE as well as Prahl et al. (1988), but they overlap with BAYSPLINE within uncertainty ( Figure 7b). BAYSPLINE inference of June-August SSTs for the Gulf of Alaska site is consistent with the original interpretation of the authors, in which they note that core tops from the region clearly show a summer temperature bias (Praetorius et al., 2015). Overall, these Late Quaternary examples demonstrate that BAYSPLINE produces reasonable results. Given U K \u2032 37 values below \u223c0.86, there is little sensitivity to the prior as the likelihood of the regression model dominates, and predictions are more or less comparable to those of previous linear calibrations. For U K \u2032 37 values above 0.86, the decreasing sensitivity to SST modeled by BAYSPLINE results in larger uncertainties and a greater reliance on the prior. However, it is important to note that even at the most extreme U K \u2032 37 values (\u223c0.99) median SSTs vary by no more than 1-1.5 \u2218 C. Thus, inference of SSTs from very high values of U K \u2032 37 is possible, albeit with large uncertainties. For example, the maximal U K \u2032 37 value of 1 predicts SSTs ranging from 27 to 39 \u2218 C (90% confidence interval) with a prior standard deviation of 10 \u2218 . This inference includes temperatures that may exceed the thermal tolerance for haptophyte algae, although the capacity for growth at high temperatures varies widely between studied strains (Conte et al., 1998), and we cannot know the maximum temperature 37 box shows the median cooling using the M\u00fcller et al. (1998) calibration. The number of sites in each box is listed below the proxy labels. tolerance of extinct coccolithophorids. Brassell (2014) noted that triunsaturated alkenones are present, albeit in very low abundance, at low-latitude sites during the middle Eocene, when independent indicators such as TEX 86 indicate tropical SSTs of \u223c33 \u2218 (Pearson et al., 2007), but are absent in the early Eocene when temperatures were presumably warmer. This may justify the use of a smaller prior standard deviation for very high values of U K \u2032 37 , although, as noted in the Gulf of Aden example above, this can artificially restrict the range of the predicted values."}, {"section_title": "BAYSPLINE: A New Calibration Model", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Statistical Approach", "text": "Our analysis of the core-top data set demonstrates that U K \u2032 37 is seasonally biased in the northern high latitudes and the Mediterranean and that U K \u2032 37 sensitivity to temperature decreases substantially above 24 \u2218 C. A calibration model must therefore accommodate these observations. To resolve the seasonality issue, we simply match core-top U K \u2032 37 within the regions identified in Figure 3c to seasonal temperatures inferred from our 10.1002/2017PA003201 correlations (Figure 4). This corresponds to August-October SSTs for the North Atlantic, June-August SSTs for the North Pacific, and November-May SSTs for the Mediterranean. In doing so, we make explicit in the model that temperatures inferred for these regions will correspond to a seasonal, and not annual, average. The slope attenuation at the high end of the U K \u2032 37 -SST relationship calls for a model that is flexible enough to account for nonlinearities. We experimented with sigmoidal functions, including logistic curves and Richard's curves, but these failed to adequately fit the data, resulting in further trends in the residuals (not shown). We therefore chose to use B (Basis)-splines to model the U K \u2032 37 -SST relationship. B-splines have an advantageous property in that they can be linearly combined to form a spline curve (piecewise polynomial function) that can accommodate both the relatively linear relationship between U K \u2032 37 and SST below 24 \u2218 C, as well as the nonlinear slope attenuation above that point. The B-spline function transforms the SST data (x) such that where n is the order of the spline, i is the number of basis splines, i is the coefficient for each basis spline, and B i,n (x) is the spline evaluation of SSTs for each basis spline of order n. Knots define the breakpoints between which different basis spline functions are used, and the functions are continuous and differentiable between and at the knots. To guard against overfitting, our approach to order and knot selection is conservative; we seek the minimum order and number of knots to preserve linearity at lower temperatures (which the data support; Figure 5b) while eliminating the residual trend at the warm end of the calibration. We found that a low-order (n = 3) spline with three knots, one at the lowest and highest SSTs observed in the calibration data set and a third placed near the start of the attenuation (knots = [\u22120.4 23.6 29.6]), contains the minimum number of regression coefficients (four) sufficient to meet these stipulations. Greater complexity, that is, higher-order splines and additional knots, offered no benefits in terms of fit, while reduced complexity failed to adequately account for the nonlinearity at high SSTs. Since our spline transformation is simply a linear combination of B-splines, the regression model conveniently becomes a multiple linear regression: where Y is the N\u00d71 vector of U K \u2032 37 observations, {B(X)} is the N\u00d7M design matrix, with each column composed of one of the basis functions evaluated at the SST values, is the M \u00d7 1 vector of the B-spline coefficients, and is the N \u00d7 1 vector of residual errors, approximated as a Normal distribution with a mean of 0 and variance 2 (multiplied by the identity matrix I). To infer the coefficients and variance 2 from the core-top data set, we use Bayesian inference (Gelman et al., 2003). The advantage of Bayesian inference is that uncertainties for each of our model parameters can be estimated in an ensemble-based way. The model parameter uncertainties may then be propagated when the calibration is applied to predict SSTs from downcore U K \u2032 37 values. Generally speaking, Bayes' rule states that the posterior probability of an event is contingent upon both the likelihood and prior knowledge about event. For our application, this is written as follows: The conditional probability on the left-hand side is what we would like to estimate: the posterior probability distribution of the regression parameters and 2 , given the calibration data and the model. This posterior is proportional to the quantity on the right-hand side: the likelihood of the U K \u2032 37 observations given the spline-transformed SST values and the regression parameters (p(Y| {B(X)} , , 2 )), times a prior probability distribution p( , 2 ). The priors represent \"prior knowledge\" on the parameters of interest (the regression coefficients and the error variance 2 ); for example, one could build in restrictions on the direction or magnitude of the parameters if it were appropriate for the system. In our case, we would like the core-top calibration data (expressed within the likelihood) to dominate the posterior, so we set our priors to be relatively \"uninformative,\" that is, with a large standard deviation. The means for the prior distributions are derived from an ordinary least squares estimate (see Appendix A). As the model combines a B-spline fit with Bayesian inference, we call it \"BAYSPLINE.\" To infer the posterior, we calculate conditional posteriors and use a Gibbs sampler (Gelman et al., 2003) (see Appendix A for details)."}, {"section_title": "10.1002/2017PA003201 BAYSPLINE models U K \u2032", "text": "37 as a function of the B-spline-transformed SSTs. In order to use BAYSPLINE for paleoclimate prediction-that is, predict SSTs from U K \u2032 37 -we must invert the model relationship, which requires another application of Bayes' rule. The posterior distribution of SSTs (X new ) is estimated from the likelihood of the U K \u2032 37 values (Y new ) given the calibration model, times a prior distribution of SSTs: Note that the uncertainties in the calibration model parameters ( , 2 ) are propagated through to the calculation of the posterior SSTs. A prior distribution of SSTs p(X new ) is also required here for Bayesian closure. For computational convenience, we choose a Normal prior with the mean value drawn from the median Prahl et al. (1988) approximation of SST from the target U K \u2032 37 data (P m = median ) and a standard deviation that is user defined. We recommend using a conservative value such as 10 \u2218 C; however, the user could, for example, restrict the probability of unrealistically high or low SSTs if they have prior geological knowledge to motivate that decision. This flexibility is one of the advantages of the Bayesian approach. Due to the spline transformation, the posterior distribution does not have an analytic solution, so to carry out this inference we make use of the Metropolis algorithm (Gelman et al., 2003). See Appendix A for computational details. Figure 6 shows the BAYSPLINE model and its residual patterns. Although localized areas of elevated residuals are still present, the high latitudes and Mediterranean no longer exhibit a consistent pattern (Figure 6c) and there are no significant trends in the residuals (Figure 6b). The slope attenuation at warm SSTs is well described by BAYSPLINE; the trend evident in Figure 3b is absent (Figure 6b). The slope of BAYSPLINE is indistinguishable from that of Prahl et al. (1988) and other previous global calibrations below 23.4 \u2218 C (0.034; see Table 1); above this point, it declines steadily to a minimum of 0.011 at the highest temperature in the calibration data set (29.4 \u2218 C). The average standard (1 ) error ( \u221a 2 ) of the BAYSPLINE model is 0.049 U K \u2032 37 units, which translates to 1.4 \u2218 C below 23.4 \u2218 C and climbs to a maximum of 4.4 \u2218 C for temperatures above that point ( Table 1). The increase in error at high temperatures is expected, as the slope, and therefore the sensitivity of U K \u2032 37 to temperature change, declines. The error of the BAYSPLINE calibration is higher than the Prahl et al. (1988) regression, but the latter was based on only five data points from a culture experiment and does not sample core-top variance (Table 1). BAYSPLINE's error in the linear part of the spline is generally comparable to other global, core-top calibrations (Conte et al., 2006;M\u00fcller et al., 1998) who have 1 errors between 1 and 1.5 \u2218 C (Table 1)."}, {"section_title": "Model Results", "text": "To compare the predictive performance of BAYSPLINE with previous U K \u2032 37 calibrations, we apply the model to representative Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 19-23 ka) to present time series that together span a wide range of U K \u2032 37 values ( Figure 7). We test different prior standard deviations to assess the impact of this choice-which is user defined-on model results. Data from the Gulf of Aden (Tierney et al., 2016) traverse the warmer end of the calibration and demonstrate the effect that BAYSPLINE's treatment of slope attenuation has on inference. At this site, the Prahl et al. (1988) regression predicts Holocene SSTs that are slightly cooler than modern values (Figure 7a), and a relatively small LGM cooling of \u22121.8 \u2218 C. The Sonzogni et al. (1997) regression, which was developed for application in the tropical Indian Ocean and has a lower slope (0.023) predicts SSTs close to modern values during the Holocene and a more generous glacial cooling of \u22122.6 \u2218 C (Figure 7a). With a narrow prior standard deviation of 5 \u2218 C, BAYSPLINE produces a similar cooling (\u22122.5 \u2218 C), only with slightly warmer median temperatures (Figure 7a). With more generous priors, BAYSPLINE predicts temperatures during the Holocene (\u223c29-30 \u2218 C) that are on average warmer than modern SSTs (but overlap within uncertainties) and a greater magnitude of glacial cooling (\u22122.9 to \u22123.5 \u2218 C; Figure 7a). Although glacial SSTs inferred by BAYSPLINE vary little given different prior standard deviations, there is a larger spread (\u223c1 \u2218 C) during the Holocene period (Figure 7a). This reflects increased sensitivity to the prior as the U K \u2032 37 values (0.97-0.99) approach the limit of the proxy. At these high values, the slope is low (\u223c0.015 or less), there is greater uncertainty in its determination, the likelihood of SSTs becomes expanded, and therefore the Bayesian inference relies more heavily on the relatively uninformative prior. Arguably, some constraint from the prior is needed to exclude SST values that are clearly unrealistic, for example, 40-50 \u2218 C. However, a prior that is too narrow (5 \u2218 C in this case) artificially restricts the glacial-interglacial range. A balance is struck with a prior standard deviation of 10 \u2218 C, under which extreme temperatures (>40 \u2218 C) have an appropriately low probability (<5%). With this prior assumption, median LGM cooling at the Gulf of Aden site is \u22123.2 \u2218 , a magnitude that is in good agreement with independent, Mg/Ca-based estimates from the Arabian Sea region (Dahl & Oppo, 2006;Saraswat et al., 2013;Tierney et al., 2016).

As BAYSPLINE is nonlinear, residuals are plotted in U K \u2032 37 units; however, a U K \u2032 37 error of 0.2 is roughly 6 \u2218 such that the color map is comparable with that of Figure 3.  Conte et al. (2006) refer to the core-top calibration in that study."}, {"section_title": "Implications for Paleoclimatic Interpretations", "text": "Three features distinguish BAYSPLINE from previous U K \u2032 37 calibrations: (1) explicit calibration of North Pacific, North Atlantic, and Mediterranean data to seasonal temperatures; (2) modeling of slope attenuation at high SSTs; and (3) propagation of errors in the regression model parameters and error variance, which allows for robust statistical assessment of inferred SSTs. All three of these features have an impact on paleoclimate interpretations derived from U K \u2032 37 data. Inference of seasonal temperatures in the target regions identified here is largely consistent with the intuition of researchers pursuing U K \u2032 37 -based climate reconstruction in these areas (e.g., Emeis et al., 2000;Haug et al., 2005;Praetorius et al., 2015). Calibration to a seasonal average thus simplifies interpretation and clarifies the appropriate season for comparison with climate model output. For example, Rosell-Mel\u00e9 et al. (2004) noted that U K \u2032"}, {"section_title": "37", "text": "data from the Mediterranean region show a very large cooling during the LGM (\u22127 to \u221210 \u2218 C), compared to other data at similar latitudes. Interpreted as a mean annual signal, the magnitude of this cooling is excessive when compared to model simulations (Rosell-Mel\u00e9 et al., 2004). Interpreted as a winter signal, the magnitude is reasonable, considering that pollen data from southern Europe show that LGM cooling was more pronounced in winter (Peyron et al., 1998). Application of BAYSPLINE to U K \u2032 37 data from the Tyrrhenian Sea (Cacho et al., 2001) demonstrates that Holocene values are in good agreement with modern winter SSTs, supporting a seasonal interpretation for these data, and indicate a wintertime LGM cooling of \u223c \u22126 to \u22127 \u2218 C ( Figure 8). BAYSPLINE's treatment of the slope attenuation is critical for the interpretation of U K \u2032 37 data from tropical locations, where traditional linear calibrations will underestimate the magnitude of SST change. To illustrate this, we investigate the magnitude of cooling during the LGM in the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP), using multiple SST proxies from 77 sites (data from Bard et al., 1997;Budziak, 2001;Dahl & Oppo, 2006;de Garidel-Thoron et al., 2007;Gebregiorgis et al., 2016;Gibbons et al., 2014;Huguet et al., 2006;Kudrass et al., 2001;Mohtadi et al., 2010Mohtadi et al., , 2014Palmer & Pearson, 2003;Pelejero et al., 1999;Rippert et al., 2015;Romahn et al., 2014;Saraswat et al., 2013;Schulte & M\u00fcller, 2001;Shintani et al., 2008Shintani et al., , 2011Sonzogni et al., 1998;Stott et al., 2007;Tierney et al., 2016;Waelbroeck et al., 2009;Xu et al., 2008Xu et al., , 2010Yamamoto et al., 2013). See the supporting information for details concerning the data compilation, which uses methodology from Bemis et al. (1998), Bronk Ramsey (1995, 2008, Tierney et al. (2016), Holloway et al. (2016), Khider et al. (2015), Regenberg et al. (2014), Reimer et al. (2013), Tierney and Tingley (2015). Application of the M\u00fcller et al. (1998) calibration to the U K \u2032 37 data from the IPWP suggests an average LGM cooling of only \u22121.6 \u2218 C (Figure 9). This value is much smaller than estimates based on paired Mg/Ca-18 O measurements of planktic foraminifera (\u22122.7 \u2218 C using the calibration of Tierney et al., 2016; see the supporting information for details) and TEX 86 (\u22122.9 \u2218 C using the latest BAYSPAR SST calibration, Tierney & Tingley, 2015) from the same region and in some cases, from the same locations (Figure 9). Applying BAYSPLINE to the U K \u2032 37 data reconciles this apparent difference, bringing the median estimate to \u22122.7 \u2218 C (Figure 9b). BAYSPLINE also facilitates a probabilistic approach to categorizing the magnitude of cooling in the IPWP; for example, we can state, based on the U K \u2032 37 data, that there is a 94% probability that mean IPWP cooling exceeded \u22122 \u2218 , but only a 10% probability that it exceeded \u22124 \u2218 . 37 and TEX 86 data from (a) the eastern equatorial Pacific (Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) 850, Zhang et al., 2014) and (b) the South China Sea (ODP 1143, Li et al., 2011O'Brien et al., 2014;Zhang et al., 2014). Blue line shows median inferred SSTs from BAYSPLINE, light blue error bars represent 1 uncertainties for a prior standard deviation of 10 \u2218 C, orange line shows median inferred SSTs from BAYSPAR (Tierney & Tingley, 2015), and dark gray line shows inferred sea surface temperatures from the M\u00fcller et al. (1998) calibration.\ndata form a large portion of the available tropical SST proxy data spanning the LGM, or more broadly speaking, the Late Quaternary, BAYSPLINE will impact multiproxy syntheses (e.g., Shakun & Carlson, 2010;Waelbroeck et al., 2009) and analyses derived from such products, such as estimates of Earth climate sensitivity (Hargreaves et al., 2012;Schmittner et al., 2011). BAYSPLINE also modifies interpretations of SSTs during past warm climate regimes. For example, there is an ongoing debate regarding the magnitude of warming across the tropical Pacific during the late Miocene and Pliocene that has largely fallen on proxy lines (Brierley et al., 2015;O'Brien et al., 2014;Ravelo et al., 2014;Zhang et al., 2014). In particular, the TEX 86 paleothermometer records larger-magnitude changes than both U K \u2032 37 and Mg/Ca, leading to speculation that it is capturing deeper-water temperatures (Ravelo et al., 2014). However, the tropical Pacific sites in question contain high U K \u2032 37 values, such that linear calibrations likely underestimate variability. Applying BAYSPLINE to two of these key sites (Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) 850 in the eastern equatorial Pacific and ODP 1143 in the South China Sea) demonstrates that our new calibration produces substantially better agreement with the TEX 86 estimates (Figure 10). At ODP 850, the magnitude of cooling between the Miocene (12-6 Ma) and the latest Pleistocene data (0.5-0 Ma) from BAYSPLINE (\u22126.7 \u00b1 1.6 \u2218 C, 1 ) agrees within uncertainty with the TEX 86 -estimated change (\u22126.9 \u00b1 0.9 \u2218 C, 1 ), whereas the cooling estimated from M\u00fcller et al. (1998) is only \u22124.9 \u2218 C (Figure 10a). At Site ODP 1143, application of BAYSPLINE produces dramatically different results as U K \u2032 37 values approach saturation during the Pliocene (4-2.6 Ma in Figure 10b). Here the magnitude of cooling between the Pliocene data (4-2.6 Ma) and the latest Pleistocene data (0-0.5 Ma) estimated by BAYSPLINE (\u22123.5 \u00b1 0.8 \u2218 C, 1 ) is actually larger than the TEX 86 value (\u22122.4 \u00b1 0.2, 1 ). In contrast, the M\u00fcller et al. (1998)-estimated cooling is only \u22121.9 \u2218 C and yields SSTs that are 2 \u2218 cooler than the TEX 86 predictions in the Pliocene (Figure 10b). The magnitude of TEX 86 and U K \u2032\n-inferred glacial-interglacial variability is also in better agreement when BAYSPLINE is used (Figure 10b). Overall, this example shows that perceived differences between U K \u2032 37 and TEX 86 in the warm Miocene and Pliocene may be simply due to underestimation of U K \u2032 37 -SST changes by linear calibrations, and conversely, TEX 86 can act as a reasonable tracer for SSTs in the right setting. This said, there are still locations where TEX 86 arguably records shallow thermocline variability and U K \u2032 37 and TEX 86 patterns diverge substantially (dos Santos et al., 2010;Tierney et al., 2016)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Our reexamination of core-top U K \u2032 37 demonstrates that seasonal production and slope attenuation at high temperatures are fundamental features of the data that must be explicitly accounted for to avoid calibration bias. We do not detect slope attenuation at cold temperatures, but this could be due to undersampling of 10.1002/2017PA003201 the high-latitude oceans, in particular, the Southern Ocean. We propose as a solution a Bayesian calibration for U K \u2032 37 based on B-splines (BAYSPLINE) that accommodates these features. Through application to example time series, we show that BAYSPLINE produces reasonable estimates of SSTs and improves inference in the tropical oceans. In addition to its treatment of seasonality and slope attenuation, BAYSPLINE offers an advantage in that it produces ensemble-based results that capture the uncertainty in the core-top regression. These ensembles provide meaningful uncertainty bounds and can be used for statistical reasoning. Given that U K \u2032 37 measurements comprise a substantial portion of late Cenozoic paleotemperature data, application of BAYSPLINE will enhance and improve our ability to identify the fundamental mechanisms driving climatic change in the recent geologic past. The prior means for the B-spline coefficients ( 0 ) were derived from an ordinary least squares estimate. The prior standard deviation for the B-spline coefficients ( 2 0 ) and for 2 (a 0 , b 0 ) was set to large values to keep the priors relatively uninformative, such that the core-top data are largely responsible for informing the model (see Figure S1). Multiplying the prior and the likelihood and solving for the full conditional posteriors (Gelman et al., 2003) yields Inference of the posterior then proceeds by specifying an initial value for one of the unknown parameters and using a Gibbs sampler (Gelman et al., 2003) to sequentially draw from the full conditionals in turn. We ensured monotonicity in the spline via rejection sampling (Gelman et al., 2003). We ran five separate chains of 5,000 draws each, discarding the first 200 draws of each chain as burn-in. TheR statistic (Gelman et al., 2003) indicated that convergence was achieved under these conditions (R =1.000 for all parameters), at which point the chains were concatenated and then thinned by a factor of 16 to remove serial correlation. The resulting posteriors for and 2 consist of 1,500 draws. Figure S1 shows the prior and posterior distributions and demonstrates that the data effectively constrain each regression parameter. For prediction of SSTs from U K \u2032 37 , we invert the BAYSPLINE model using another application of Bayes' rule: Due to the B-spline transformation, posterior distribution does not have an analytic solution. Thus, we use the Metropolis algorithm (Gelman et al., 2003) to calculate the posterior. For each round of sampling, a proposal of SST values is drawn from a normal jumping distribution, and its posterior probability is evaluated against an initial SST starting distribution. The proposal is either accepted or rejected, and the chain continues until convergence is reached. The U K \u2032 37 observations are treated as independent; that is, the proposal evaluation process is separate for each data point in the time series. During Metropolis sampling, we extrapolate the spline function linearly beyond its lower and upper limits of \u22120.4 \u2218 C and 29.6 \u2218 C, respectively, to allow for prediction of temperatures outside the range of modern SST values. The Metropolis sampling mixes across uncertainties 10.1002/2017PA003201 in the posterior model parameters by running parallel chains of N = 500 to sample every third paired posterior draw of and 2 (for a total M chains = 500). The first half of each chain (N = 250) is discarded as burn-in. The standard deviation of the jumping distribution (J ) was set to yield an acceptance rate between 40 and 50%, in line with the recommendations of Gelman et al. (2003). These settings result in adequate convergence (R = 1.008-1.08) while minimizing computational time (about 25-40 s on an average desktop computer). Mixing results across all 1,500 posterior samples and increasing the length of the chains by an order of magnitude (N = 5, 000), respectively, afforded no substantial improvement in convergence.
