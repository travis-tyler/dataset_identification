Individuals categorized as having SNAP are positive for AD-associated neurodegeneration biomarkers but negative for \u03b2-amyloid biomarkers (as measured using amyloid PET or CSF). They are often designated as A\u03b2\u2212N+. All studies investigating the SNAP concept have consistently demonstrated that, compared with A\u03b2+N+ individuals, those who are A\u03b2\u2212N+ possess significantly lower frequencies of apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 (OMIM 107741.0016) carriers. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] In CN individuals, as well as those with MCI and AD, APOE \u03b54 carrier status has been associated with neurodegeneration in the AD signature regions: inferior temporal, lateral parietal, and posterior cingulated and precuneus regions. 12, 13 This association suggests that, because of the relatively low prevalence of APOE \u03b54, individuals with SNAP might have less advanced AD signature neurodegeneration than do A\u03b2+N+ individuals, who possess a relatively high prevalence of APOE \u03b54 carriers. There are, however, conflicting results claiming that neurodegeneration may be more, less, or similarly advanced in A\u03b2\u2212N+ individuals than in A\u03b2+N+ individuals. 4, 8, 14 Frequency of APOE \u03b52 (OMIM 107741.0001) positivity is presumably associated with lower cerebral A\u03b2 retention, 15 and its link with cerebral neurodegeneration has so far not been examined in SNAP, to our knowledge. We investigated the extent of changes of whole-brain glucose metabolism, gray matter volume, and concentrations of t-tau and p-tau 181p in CSF to capture differences in the severity of neurodegeneration between various A\u03b2\u2212N+ subgroups and their A\u03b2+ counterparts. Results were associated with the individuals' APOE \u03b52 and APOE \u03b54 carrier status, focusing on the question of whether the genetics of those who are A\u03b2\u2212N+ may drive their patterns of neurodegeneration.

The findings did not depend on the imaging biomarker modality used to define AD-specific patterns of neurodegeneration and were similarly detectable in those classified by glucose metabolism and HV.

In patients with SNAP, better preserved temporoparietal metabolism and a higher volume of lateral temporal lobe gray matter in the presence of more severe HV atrophy may indicate decelerated neurodegeneration (tau) spread outside the medial temporal lobe in the absence of \u03b2-amyloid. 22 Lower CSF levels of tau and better sustained glucose metabolism in patients with SNAP support the commonalities between those biomarkers. 23 A recent imaging study in various AD phenotypes using 18 F-AV-1451 as a PET ligand to detect tau in vivo confirms substantial overlap between greater tau tracer retention and reduced cortical glucose metabolism. 24 Presumably, in A\u03b2\u2212N+ compared with A\u03b2+N+ patients with MCI, lower levels of CSF tau in the presence of comparable HV loss may denote SNAP as a non-AD state. 1, 25 As has been demonstrated in exemplary autopsy cases, medial temporal lobe atrophy in patients with SNAP could be associated with hippocampal sclerosis, TDP43 pathologic conditions, or argyrophilic grain disease. 10 This finding overall suggests a nonspecificity of neurodegeneration biomarkers, which could indicate a slightly different mix of non-AD conditions, such as cumulative ischemia, developmental factors, corticobasal degeneration, or primary progressive aphasia, especially in case of \u03b2-amyloid negativity. [26] [27] [28] [29] We found that patients with MCI and SNAP were not more likely to have vascular risk factors or white matter hyperintensity than were A\u03b2+N+ patients with MCI (which is also a replication of a previous finding in ADNI 14 ) , making an association between neurodegeneration from SNAP and cerebrovascular disease unlikely. On a voxelwise level, patterns of less severe neurodegeneration were comparable between subtypes of MCI with SNAP, whether they were selected through FDG meta-ROI hypometabolism or HV atrophy or whether they revealed an overlap on the 2 biomarker abnormalities. In other words, compared with their A\u03b2+ counterparts, A\u03b2\u2212FDG+ individuals displayed the same patterns of gray matter volume differences as did A\u03b2\u2212HV+ patients with SNAP, who in turn showed comparable glucose metabolism patterns as A\u03b2\u2212FDG+ patients with MCI.

[33] [34] [35] The constellation of differing frequencies of APOE isoforms in A\u03b2\u2212N+ patients with MCI seems thus to substantially account for the \u03b2-amyloid negativity in patients with SNAP. Moreover, A\u03b2\u2212 and APOE \u03b54 negativity in the presence of APOE \u03b52 could be a powerful combination contributing to the deceleration of longitudinal cognitive decline in MCI with SNAP.

Nevertheless, in MCI with SNAP, the link between APOE \u03b54 negativity and less severe neurodegeneration associated with AD is probably also associated with the patients' \u03b2-amyloid negativity. In other words, less severe AD-signature neurodegeneration in MCI with SNAP most likely results from both independent and related effects of low APOE \u03b54 carrier frequencies and A\u03b2 negativity.
