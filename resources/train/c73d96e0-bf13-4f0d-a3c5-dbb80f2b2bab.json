[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Research in Context\nAuthors reviewed relevant literature using PubMed and Google Scholar. Key studies that generated and validated polygenic risk scores (PRS) for clinical and pathologic AD were cited. PRS scores have been increasingly used in the literature but clinical utility continues to be questioned.\nIn the current research landscape concerning PRS clinical utility in the AD space, there is room for model improvement and our hypothesis was that a PRS with integrated risk for AD biomarkers could yield a better model for cognitive decline.\nThis study serves as proof-of-concept that encourages future study of integrated PRS across disease markers and utility in taking an A/T/N (amyloidosis, tauopathy and neurodegeneration) focused approach to genetic risk for cognitive decline and AD. Abstract INTRODUCTION: We developed a novel polygenic risk score (PRS) based on the A/T/N (amyloid plaques (A), phosphorylated tau tangles (T), and neurodegeneration (N)) framework and compared a PRS based on clinical AD diagnosis to assess which was a better predictor of cognitive decline. METHODS: We used summary statistics from genome wide association studies of cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b242) and phosphorylated-tau (ptau181), left hippocampal volume (LHIPV), and late-onset AD dementia to calculate PRS for 1181 participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Individual PRS were averaged to generate a composite A/T/N PRS. We assessed the association of PRS with baseline and longitudinal cognitive composites of executive function and memory. RESULTS: The A/T/N PRS showed superior predictive performance on AD biomarkers and executive function decline compared to the clinical AD PRS. DISCUSSION: Results suggest that integration of genetic risk across AD biomarkers may improve prediction of disease progression. Boldface indicates P < 0.05. *P<1.25E-03 Bonferroni threshold.

By 2025, it is expected that 7.1 million people will be affected [1] , highlighting the urgency for progress in AD-focused research. AD is highly heritable, with as much as 79% shared heritable risk reported in twin studies [2] , although the genetic architecture is complex including notable polygenicity. Phenotypically, AD includes a long prodrome in which neuropathology begins to accumulate decades before cognitive symptoms can be detected [3, 4] . For that reason, early detection is critical to prevent progression of the disease [5, 6] . A combined screening approach that integrates biomarker, genomic, and clinical information will likely be required to optimize early identification and prevention of AD progression [7, 8] .\nPolygenic risk scores (PRS) represent a tool for early AD risk detection; however, studies that used PRS to predict AD case/control status reported predictive accuracy (AUCmax) of less than 83% [9] [10] [11] [12] , and the clinical utility of PRS beyond the APOE locus have been questioned [12, 13] . A wealth of genetic data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have become available in recent years [14] , and incorporation of additional genetic data may represent a strategy to improve PRS predictive ability. In 2010, the largest GWAS of AD involved ~16,000 participants [15] , compared to the recently completed AD GWAS that included ~600,000 participants [16] . This increase in GWAS data have enabled an increase in the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) used to calculate AD genetic risk scores. Some of the first PRS studies used as few as 5 SNPs to calculate AD risk, compared to 205,068\nSNPs in a more recent study [17] . Despite the progress made in genomic studies of AD, PRS continue to show limited power, and innovative analytical strategies from novel perspectives are required if PRS are going to attain clinical utility. Improvement for PRS may come from GWAS of AD endophenotypes which focus on neuropathological features of the disease. In fact, in vivo biomarkers of AD neuropathology have become a central feature used to identify cognitively normal individuals who are at the greatest risk of cognitive decline [4, 18] . Additionally, the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association released a research framework for AD in which the pathological accumulation of amyloid plaques (A), neurofibrillary tangles composed of tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N) are recommended to be included in diagnostic categories of AD used for research [19] . While this A/T/N framework has emerged in studies of preclinical disease, it has not been integrated into PRS for AD despite the availability of GWAS summary statistics for autopsy and in vivo measures of A/T/N [20, 21] . Indeed, a previous study suggested that shared genetic drivers for hippocampal volume (a marker of neurodegeneration) and AD may exist [22] . Thus, integrating the common and independent genetic drivers of clinical AD and A/T/N could produce models with higher predictive capacity for cognitive decline in late life.\nWe set out to determine how PRS for CSF biomarkers of AD (amyloid and ptau181), hippocampal volume, and clinical AD relate to biomarkers of AD and longitudinal cognitive performance. We then developed a novel composite PRS using the A/T/N framework to integrate genetic risk for AD biomarkers, hippocampal volume, and clinical AD diagnosis into a single score (A/T/N PRS). We compared the predictive capabilities of the A/T/N score to a PRS score for clinical AD and hypothesized that the A/T/N PRS would serve as a more predictive genetic risk profile compared to a PRS for clinical AD alone."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Participants were drawn from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database (ADNI; adni.loni.usc.edu) launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership.

Not surprisingly, the CSF A\u03b242 PRS was negatively associated with measured CSF A\u03b242 levels, indicating a higher CSF A\u03b242 PRS is associated with higher brain A\u03b242 burden. The CSF A\u03b242 PRS model explained 4.6% of the variance in CSF A\u03b242 levels (Supplemental Table 2 , p=4.1E-06). The association remained significant after removing the APOE region (p=6.5E-04, R 2 =0.035) and when restricting the sample to cognitively normal and MCI individuals (p=3.7E-05, R 2 =0.045). Notably, the A/T/N score was the best predictor of CSF A\u03b242, with the model explaining 7.6% of the variance (Supplemental Figure 1, p=6 .8E-12) and this score was predictive of CSF A\u03b242 in normal cognition controls (p=1.1E-03, R 2 =0.076).\nCSF Ptau PRS showed a significant positive association with CSF ptau181 concentrations (Supplemental Table 3 , R 2 =0.038, p=0.003), however this association did not meet the Bonferroni threshold for all 40 models tested. This association remained significant after excluding the APOE region (p=0.01, R 2 =0.046) and after exclusion of AD participants (p=1.1E-03, R 2 =0.059). Again, the A/T/N PRS showed the strongest association with CSF ptau181 concentrations compared to other scores, where a higher A/T/N PRS was associated with higher CSF ptau levels (p=8.3E-06, R 2 =0.051).\nWe also validated the hippocampal volume PRS, whereby a higher PRS for left hippocampal volume was associated with greater left hippocampal volume at baseline and the model explained 22.2% of variance in the LHIPV data (Supplemental Table 4 , p=8.9E-04).\nNotably, this association was significant after excluding the APOE region. The PRS for clinical AD (calculated using a subset of the original IGAP data), and CSF A\u03b242 PRS were also significantly associated with baseline left hippocampal volume. The clinical AD PRS score showed the strongest association and accounted for the highest variance in this outcome (R 2 =0.223, p=3.0E-04), although all PRS had similar effect sizes (R 2 ranging from 0.215 to 0.223).\nAs expected, the clinical AD PRS showed the strongest association with AD diagnosis (Supplemental Table 5 , p=7.4E-08, R 2 =0.111) and remained significant after exclusion of the APOE region (p=1.3E-03, R 2 =0.079).

These associations were not significant after exclusion of the APOE region but remained significant after exclusion of AD participants. It is noteworthy that the CSF A\u03b242 PRS model also showed a nominal association with baseline executive function (p=0.04).\nThe clinical AD and A/T/N PRS were associated with baseline memory performance ( Figure 3 ; A/T/N p=0.048, R 2 =0.093; Clinical AD p=6.8E-05, R 2 =0.102), and remained significant after excluding AD participants from the analysis.

The A/T/N PRS also performed comparably to the clinical AD PRS on baseline cognitive measures (memory, executive function) and longitudinal memory performance.\nTogether, our findings suggest that utilizing the A/T/N framework by combining genetic risk for AD with genetic risk for AD biomarkers yields a better fitting prediction model, particularly in the earliest stages of disease.\nAs more GWAS data for AD endophenotypes have become available, it was important that we validate whether PRS for A/T/N are truly predictive of biomarkers in this independent dataset. All PRS were validated for their respective outcomes, and importantly, we found that combining PRS across A/T/N provided a more robust predictor of the individual AD biomarkers.\nIt could be the case that genetic variants with small effects have functional impact across biomarkers, positioning a composite A/T/N score to capture more genetic overlap between biomarkers and amplify relevant signals for associations. As sample sizes continue to increase in genetic studies of amyloid, tau, and hippocampal atrophy in late-life, it is quite likely that the sensitivity of these PRS will continue to improve. Currently, the scores appear to provide a small boost in sensitivity to early deposition of pathology.\nSimilarly, the A/T/N PRS appeared to provide more sensitivity to risk of executive function decline, particularly when including participants across the clinical spectrum of AD. In contrast, the clinical AD PRS appeared to perform comparably to the A/T/N score in predicting memory performance, suggesting that the current polygenic predictors of clinical AD may be particularly sensitive to memory dysfunction. Given that many of the cohorts included in the AD GWAS studies come from memory clinics across the country, it is not surprising to see such robust associations with memory performance. However, when the APOE region is excluded the A/T/N score remains significantly associated with memory decline while the clinical AD score does not, suggesting that the A/T/N score may provide genetic prediction above and beyond the APOE region in the context of memory decline. However, the clinical utility of the additional sensitivity provided by the A/T/N PRS in non-memory domains remains to be determined.\nIt is notable that the associations we observed with biomarkers of neuropathology and longitudinal cognitive decline explained variance above and beyond APOE, which has been a limitation of previous PRS analyses [42] . Certainly, APOE is a critical genetic component in AD, but AD remains a complex polygenic trait including many genetic effects with small effect sizes.\nPooling across these small effects does appear to provide a score that shows more robust associations than reliance on the top genetic signal alone.\nPrevious work has shown that the clinical AD PRS derived from IGAP summary statistics was predictive of bilateral hippocampal volume in a Brazilian youth cohort [43] , aligning with the clinical AD PRS association with left hippocampal volume demonstrated in this study. Together, these results may suggest that genetic drivers of hippocampal volume are influential throughout life. This association also fits with previous literature which reported a PRS for late-onset AD was associated with hippocampal function, as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) [44] . Few studies to date have tested PRS associations with late life cognitive change, and results have been mixed [45, 46] .\nA strength of our chosen validation set was the wealth of clinical and genetic data including more than 1,100 participants. However, the GWAS summary statistics and the present analyses were sampled from highly-educated, Non-Hispanic White populations and generalizability of findings to more diverse groups is limited. PRS analyses can capture the common genetic risk for disease, however other disease contributors such as rare variants, gene-gene and gene-environment interactions may not be as accurately modeled. Larger sample sizes for GWAS of endophenotypes in particular would improve power of PRS models.\nIn their current form, PRS models of CSF biomarkers explain a small portion of the variance, suggesting substantial gains could be reached as sample sizes grow.\nOverall, this study suggests an integration of genetic components in the A/T/N framework can be used to explain a greater percentage of variability in longitudinal cognition data compared to previously published genetic risk scores for late-onset clinical AD. Importantly, the calculated A/T/N PRS was significantly associated with longitudinal cognition in the absence of the APOE region, suggesting a greater degree of genetic risk for cognitive decline can be captured above and beyond APOE. Future PRS development should employ endophenotypespecific approaches to predict cognitive trajectories. "}]
