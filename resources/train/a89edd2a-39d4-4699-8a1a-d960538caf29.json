[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases in elderly and the incidence of this disease is increasing with older ages. One of the hallmarks of AD is the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques (A\u03b2) in human brains. Most of prior brain imaging researchers used the clinical symptom based diagnosis without the confirmation of imaging or fluid A\u03b2 information. In this work, we study hippocampus morphometry on a cohort consisting of A\u03b2 positive AD (N = 151) and matched A\u03b2 negative cognitively unimpaired subjects (N = 271) with A\u03b2 positivity determined via florbetapir PET. The brain images are obtained from publicly available Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We compute our surface multivariate morphometry statistics from segmented hippocampus structure in structural MR images. With these features, we find statistically significant difference by using Hotelling's T 2 tests. Meanwhile, we apply a patch-based analysis of sparse coding system for binary group classification and achieve an accuracy rate of 90.48%. Our results demonstrate that our surface multivariate morphometry statistics (MMS) perform better than traditional hippocampal volume measures in classification and it may be applied as a potential biomarker for distinguishing dementia due to AD from age matched normal aging individuals."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "With the population living longer than ever before, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is now a major public health concern with the number of affected patients expected to triple, reaching 13.8 million by the year 2050 in the U.S. alone. One of the hallmarks of AD is the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques (A\u03b2) in human brains and a positive A\u03b2 reading is now accepted as 'dementia due to AD' together with the presence of clinical symptoms. Moreover, preclinical AD is now viewed as a gradual process before the onset of the clinical symptoms and yet with the A\u03b2 positivity which is viewed\nThe research was supported in part by NIH (R21AG049216, RF1AG051710, R01EB025032, U54EB020403, R01AG031581 and P30AG19610) and NSF (DMS-1413417 and IIS-1421165).\nas precursor of anatomical abnormality such as atrophy and functional changes such as hypometabolism/hypoperfusion. Current therapeutic failures in patients with dementia due to AD might reflect intervention that is too late, or targets that are secondary effects and less relevant to disease initiation and early progression [1] .\nIt is commonly agreed that an effective presymptomatic diagnosis and treatment of AD could have enormous public health benefits. Brain imaging has the potential to provide valid diagnostic biomarkers of preclinical stage as well as symptomatic AD. Owing to its close relationship between neurodegeneration and cognition, atrophy measured by structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) has been shown to detect and track characteristic and progressive measurements of hippocampal, regional gray matter, and whole brain atrophy in clinical and late preclinical stages of AD. While a variety of research has been devoted to studies on the group difference or personal diagnosis with sMRI analysis, limited research has been conducted on those A\u03b2 positive AD patients and A\u03b2 negative cognitively unimpaired subjects. The knowledge gained from this type of research will enrich our understanding on the relationship between brain atrophy and AD pathology and thus benefit assessing disease burden, progression and effects of treatments.\nIn this paper, we propose to apply surface-based subcortical morphometry analysis to a cohort consisting of patients with dementia due to AD (defined A\u03b2 positive and the presence of clinical symptoms) and A\u03b2 negative cognitively unimpaired subjects (not individuals at preclinical stage of AD). Most of the researchers, who work on subcortical morphometric studies, used volume as the measurement of atrophy [2, 3] but recent research shows that the surface of the subcortical structure may provide more valuable information than the volume [4, 5] . There are many surface morphometry measures, such as radial distances (RD, distance between each surface points to its medical center) [4] , local area differences [6] , spherical harmonic analysis [7] and Gaussian random fields [8] . Surface tensor-based morphometry (TBM) [9] is an intrinsic surfacer statistic that examines spatial derivatives of the deformation maps that register brains to a common template and construct morphological tensor maps. We recently proposed a multivariate TBM (mTBM) Fig. 1 . System pipeline. The first part in the blue bar shows the hippocampus segment. The second part in the orange bar represents MMS on each surface point. The last part in the green bar is the study of group difference and classification.\n[10] and later further combined RD and mTBM into surface multivariate morphometry statistics (MMS) [11] .\nIn this context, we adopt surface MMS of hippocampi as imaging biomarkers and design two different experiments for validation. The first experiment is to calculate the group difference between A\u03b2+ AD and A\u03b2-NL and the second experiment to classify these two groups. We hypothesize that our work may provide improved statistical power than traditional hippocampal volume or surface area measures. We achieve satisfying results that support MMS may be used as a valid biomarker of pathology-confirmed AD patients. Fig. 1 is the diagram of the system pipeline. We detail our system design in the following subsections."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Hippocampus Segment", "text": "We segmented the hippocampus from MRI scans by using FSL package [12] . Firstly, all the images were registered to a standard space (MNI152). Then, we used FIRST to extract subcortical structures and generate a binary image with different labels for each structure [13] .\nWith the binary image, we could acquire the hippocampus structures and then constructed triangular meshes by marching cubes algorithm [14, 15] . To overcome the noise caused by the image scanning and the effects of partial volume, we built a smoothing method with two steps, \"progressive meshed\" and Loop subdivision, which can also preserve the features. Fig. 2 shows that the smoothed meshes have betterrestored shape."}, {"section_title": "Surface Multivariate Morphometry Statistics", "text": "Surface multivariate morphometry statistics (MMS) consists of two different features, multivariate tensor-based morphometry (mTBM) and radial distance (RD). To calculate the surface MMS, we need to finish the following two steps. First of all, a nonlinear surface registration method, fluid registration, was used to map the individual hippocampal surface to a standard template surface. After that, we computed the local surface deformation to get mTBM as well as RD.\nWe proposed a surface registration method, surface fluid registration, by combining conformal mapping and image fluid registration. We treated the hippocampal surface as a cylinder, of which both the top and bottom have a hole and we cut one boundary across the surface that links the two holes [11] . This allowed us to map the hippocampal surface to a 2D rectangular surface. Finally, the hippocampal surface was registered to a standard surface by constrained harmonic maps. For two surfaces, S 1 and S 2 , their harmonic mapping \u03be is like following:\n\u03be 1 and \u03be 2 are conformal parameterizations, which map S 1 and S 2 to the rectangular surface, R 2 . We can accordingly obtain a map \u03c4 from surface\nAfter registration, we computed the multivariate morphometry statistics. The first feature is called multivariate tensor-based morphometry (mTBM), which is a 3 \u00d7 1 feature vector, a \"Log-Euclidean metric\" [16] on the set of deformation tensors S. The deformation tensor is defined as S = (J T J) 1/2 , where J is the Jacobian matrix. Suppose \u03c4 = S 1 \u21d2 S 2 is a map from surface S 1 to S 2 and x and y are two faces isometrically embedded on plane R 2 . We can approximate the derivate map d\u03c4 from the face on surface\n, where x i and y i are the planar coordinates of vertices. Then we calculated the Jacobian matrix for derivative map as\nThe second feature is the radial distance [4, 17] , which is represented as the shortest distance from each surface vertex to the medical axis of a tube-shape surface."}, {"section_title": "Group Difference Study", "text": "We calculated the group difference between the two groups of subjects by using Hotelling's T 2 test. Statistical results were corrected for multiple comparisons using the permutation test [10] . Firstly, with two groups of 4-dimensional vectors, P i , i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , m and N j , j = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n, we computed their Mahalanobis distance, \nwhereP andN are the mean and \u03a3 is the combined covariance matrix of two groups. Secondly, we randomly divided the subjects into two different groups, of which the true group has the same number of subjects, and recomputed the group difference on each point on the surface. The procedure was repeated for 10,000 times and got 10,000 permutation values on each vertex. Then the uncorrected p value on each surface was calculated by the ratio of the number of permutation values greater than the true group t value to the total permutation times. To show the result, we built a form, p-map. By giving a pre-defined statistical threshold, p < 0.05, we could define a new feature which is the number of the surface vertex with an uncorrected p value lower than the threshold. We could treat the feature as the real effect in the true experiment. By comparing the features derived from the random groupings, we acquired a ratio stood for the fraction of the time an effect of similar magnitude to the real effect occurs in the random assignments. This ratio provided the map a global-level significance, which is also a corrected significance."}, {"section_title": "Classification study", "text": "Since the feature dimension is much larger than the number of subjects during a classification algorithm based on 3D images or surface-based features, in this paper, we used dictionary learning and sparse coding to reduce the dimension before prediction. dictionary learning has been widely used in processing image as it can construct the natural image patches accurately [5] . Stochastic Coordinate Coding (SCC) [18] was adopted when constructing the dictionary since it can accelerate the computation speed.\nWith a finite training set of signals, P = (p 1 , p 2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , p m ), in R x\u00d7m image patches, where each patches p i \u2208 R x , i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , m and x is the dimension of image patch, we tried to optimize the empirical cost function,\nD \u2208 R x\u00d7m is the dictionary, of which each column represents a basis vector, and l(p i , D) is the loss function that measures whether D could represent the signal p well.\nSupposed we have n atoms, d j \u2208 R p , j = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n, where n is much smaller than m but larger than p and p i could be represented as p i = n j=1 q i,j d j . Then, we converted the p-dimensional vector p i to an n-dimensional vector q i = (q i,1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , q i,n ), which means the learned feature vector q i is a sparse vector. Therefore, we applied the idea of sparse patch features into the optimization problem for each patch p i . where \u03c3 is the regularization parameter, \u00b7 is the standard Euclidean norm and\nx\u00d7n is the dictionary. The first part of the equation measures the degree of the image patches' goodness and the second is the sparsity of the learned feature q i . The columns d i is constrained by \nHere, D is the dictionary and Q is the sparse code. When neither D or Q is fixed, it will require a lot of time to solve the other one. Thus, we choose the SCC algorithm. which can dramatically reduce the computational cost of the sparse coding while keeping a comparable performance."}, {"section_title": "EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Description", "text": "The data we used in the experiment were downloaded from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) project [2] . From the given form, we get 422 subjects (Table  1) , which includes 151 A\u03b2 positive AD subjects and 271 A\u03b2 negative normal (NL) ones. The A\u03b2 positivity was determined using mean-cortical SUVR (standard uptake value ratio) with cerebellum as reference region. The threshold of 1.18 was determined by comparing the mean-cortical SUVR of neuropathologically confirmed A\u03b2 positive AD patients with age matched cognitively unimpaired individuals. All the high-resolution MRI scans were acquired from ADNI 1, ADNI GO and ANDI 2. In the following text, we use the terms AD, A\u03b2+ AD and A\u03b2 positive AD, or NL, A\u03b2-NL, and A\u03b2 negative NL, interchangeably.

They were then converted to meshes and further smoothed by a feature-preserved method. We registered hippocampal surface with surface fluid registration and computed a set of the multivariate statistics (MMS), i.e., mTBM (3\u00d71 vector) and RD (1\u00d71 vector), on each mesh vertex.\nWith MMS, we computed Mahalanobis distance to measure the group difference. The p-map (bottom row in Fig. 3 ), shows the group difference computed by the Hotelling's T 2 test and corrected by the multiple comparisons with a 10000-time permutation test. We set the threshold as p <0.05 and the global differences, of which the p-values are less than 0.0001, are significant on both sides of the hippocampi. We also made permutation test on left hippocampal volume and hippocampal surface area measures. The top row in Fig. 3 shows their distributions and their p-values are also lower than 0.0001, which means the features of hippocampal volume and area are equally effective with MMS for group difference study."}, {"section_title": "Classification Result", "text": "We also processed a classification method to prove the significant difference between AD and NL. After we generated the feature mesh that contains a (4\u00d71 vector) on each vertex, we extracted the surface feature by randomly collecting small image patches on hippocampal surfaces. These image patches are 10 windows that overlapped to each other. As for the vertices that located the overlapped area, we averaged their counterparts from the centered patches. We can consider the procedure as applying a high-pass filter to the hippocampus mesh, which leads to the result that the geometrical structures are kept in the centered mesh and some low frequencies are eliminated. In this way, we convert the features of the whole mesh into 1008 patches. Then the dictionary was initialized by selection random patches. We learned the dictionary and sparse codes by SCC and use a batch size of 1 to train the model for 10 epochs. Finally, max-pooling method [19] was applied to reduce the features to a reasonable size.\nWith these dimension-reduced MMS features, we adopted a weak classifier, Adaboost, to discriminate subjects into two groups, AD and NL. In order to estimate classification accuracy, we employed 10-fold leave-one-out cross validation method. To indicate the number of correct class labels, we built a contingency We also compared our work with two other features, hippocampal volume and surface area. Each of them is a 2 \u00d7 1 vector per subject, which were both classified by SVM classifier [20] with a linear kernel. Fig. 4 shows the result comparison. It shows that the classification accuracy of our features, MMS, reached 90.48%, which is better than the ones on volume (80.09%) and area (78.44%). Our work achieved relatively good sensitivity (91.67%), specificity (88.89%), and negative predictive value (88.89%). Finally, we compared the results with the ground truth and computed the receiver operation characteristic (ROC) curves (Fig. 5) . It shows that the area under the curve (AUC) of our work is 0.9213, which is also higher than those of volume (0.8927) and area (0.8742). Although more studies are warranted, our results show MMS achieved superior results than hippocampal volume/area measures in the pathology-confirmed AD classification research."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "We employed a surface-based subcortical morphometry analysis on a cohort consisting of A\u03b2+ AD and A\u03b2-cognitively unimpaired subjects and the two aforementioned experiment results demonstrated our surface MMS can be applied as a potential biomarker for pathology-confirmed AD analysis.
