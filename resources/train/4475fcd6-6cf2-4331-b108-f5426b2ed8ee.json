[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Despite recent discovery in GWAS of genomic variants associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), its underlying biological mechanisms are still elusive. Discovery of novel AD-associated genetic variants, particularly in coding regions and from APOE \u03b5 4 non-carriers, may provide more insights into the understanding of the pathology of AD. In this study, we carried out exome-wide association analysis of age-of-onset of AD with ~20,000 subjects, and placed more emphasis on APOE \u03b5 4 non-carriers. Using Cox mixed-effects models, we find that age-of-onset shows a stronger genetic signal than AD case-control status, capturing many known variants with stronger significance, and also revealing three new variants. We identified two novel rare variants, rs56201815, a synonymous variant in ERN1, from the analysis of APOE \u03b5 4 noncarriers, and a missense variant rs144292455 in TACR3. In addition, we detected rs12373123, a common missense variant in SPPL2C in the MAPT region, associated with age-of-onset of AD in APOE \u03b5 4 non-carriers. In an attempt to unravel their regulatory and biological functions, we found that the minor allele of rs56201815 was associated with lower average FDG uptake across five brain regions in ADNI. Our eQTL analyses based on 6198 gene expression samples from ROSMAP and GTEx revealed that the minor allele of rs56201815 was associated with elevated expression of ERN1, a key gene triggering unfolded protein response (UPR), in multiple brain regions, including posterior cingulate cortex and nucleus accumbens. Our cell type-specific eQTL analysis of based on ~80,000 single nuclei in prefrontal cortex revealed that the protective minor allele of rs12373123 significantly increased expression of GRN in microglia, and was associated with MAPT expression in astrocytes. These findings provide novel evidence supporting the hypothesis of the potential involvement of the UPR to ER stress in the pathological pathway of AD, and also provide more insights into underlying regulatory mechanisms behind the pleiotropic effects of rs12373123 in multiple degenerative diseases including AD and Parkinson's disease."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Late-onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder accounting for 50-70% of all dementia cases in elder population (Winblad et al., 2016) . Amyloid \u03b2 -peptide (A\u03b2) was the primary component found in the neuritic plaques of AD patient brain, and multiple mutations in the APP gene and its related genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) promoting A\u03b2 production have been identified in familial (early onset) AD (Goate et al., 1991; Levy-Lahad et al., 1995; Mullan et al., 1992; Rogaev et al., 1995; Sherrington et al., 1995) . These observations support a causal role of A\u03b2 deposition in the etiology of AD. Familial AD is, however, much rarer than sporadic AD, which is highly prevalent after age 65. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a large number of genetic variants associated with the risk of late onset AD (Guerreiro et al., 2013; Harold et al., 2009; Hollingworth et al., 2011; Jansen et al., 2019; Jonsson et al., 2013; Lambert et al., 2013; Naj et al., 2011) , most of which are located in genes exclusively expressed in microglia (e.g., TREM2). These insights suggest involvement of microglia in the pathology of AD.\nDespite recent progress in understanding the biological mechanisms underlying AD, the cellular and molecular activities and causation in late onset AD of most common variants discovered in GWAS, including those in APOE, remain unclear. Functional links between most of these AD related loci and genes are still to be determined although some microglia-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in e.g., CD33, and the MS4A gene cluster, are shown to be mediated through TREM2 (Deming et al., 2019; Griciuc et al., 2019) . The functional mechanisms of TREM2 in A\u03b2 uptake by microglia are also complicated, and contradictory biological consequences are observed in mouse models (see e.g., (Gratuze et al., 2018) for a review on this topic). Moreover, adding up the APOE variant and other nine identified top SNPs accounts for a small portion (5%) of variation of age-of-onset (Raghavan and Tosto, 2017) , suggesting that missing genetic mechanisms contribute to this complex disease. We expect that discovery of additional AD associated genetic variants will provide more insights into the understanding of the AD pathology.\nanalyses were performed using Cox mixed effects models implemented in the coxmeg R package (He and Kulminski, 2019) . We built a genetic relatedness matrix (GRM) using the ADSP WES data to correct for relatedness of the subjects. We found that the genomic inflation was well controlled in all three analyses (\u03bb=1.04, 1.09, and 1.06) (Fig. S1 ).\nExome-wide analysis of age-of-onset of AD in the discovery phase\nIn the first analysis (using all subjects without the adjustment for APOE \u03b5 4), we detected four independent signals passing the exome-wide threshold (p=5e-07) (Fig. 1A , Table S2 , Model 1). The most significant SNP was the APOE \u03b5 4-coding variant rs429358, having a hazard ratio (HR) of 4.37 (p=3.729e-508). The p-value is much more significant than that reported in the largest meta-analysis so far based on AD status (p=5.79e-276) (Jansen et al., 2019) . This finding confirms previous findings (Blacker et al., 1997; Naj et al., 2014; Sando et al., 2008) that APOE \u03b5 4 is not only associated with AD status, but also substantially decreases its age at onset ( Fig. 2A) . The three signals outside the APOE region are rs75932628 (the R47H mutation) in TREM2 (HR=2.72, p=2.04e-16), rs7982 in CLU (HR=0.887, p=5.98e-08), and rs2405442 in PILRA (HR=0.88, p=7.67e-08) (Fig. 1A , Table S2 , Model 1). Beneficial association of the missense variant rs7982 in CLU was not reported in the previous study of AD status using the same ADSP sample (Bis et al., 2018) . We observed that the minor allele carriers of rs7982 had lower hazards consistently across a wide age interval (Fig. 2B) . Although the R47H mutation in TREM2 and rs2405442 in PILRA were identified in the previous analysis (Bis et al., 2018) , our analysis increased significance for the R47H mutation (p=2.04e-16 vs. 4.8e-12). In addition, we observed well-known AD-associated SNPs among the top hits, including rs12453 in MS4A6A (p=7.08e-06), rs2296160 in CR1 (p=9.05e-06), and rs592297 in PICALM (p=5.25e-05) (Table  S2 , Model 1).\nIn the second analysis (using all subjects with the adjustment for APOE \u03b5 4), we identified seven independent significant SNPs (p<5e-07) (Fig. 1B , Table S2 , Model 2) including three aforementioned variants in TREM2, CLU and PILRA. Four additional variants include rs144292455 in TACR3 on 4q24 (HR=5.53, p=5.39e-07, MAC=17), rs111033333 in USH2A 1q41 (HR=4.58, p=2.74e-07, MAC=19), rs199533 in NSF on 17q21.31 (HR=0.87, p=3.95e-07, minor allele frequency (MAF)=20.2%), and rs61981931 in CDKL1 14q21.3 (HR=0.77, p=4.57e-07, MAF=4.9%). The SNP rs199533 in NSF was previously reported in (Bis et al., 2018 ), but did not reach the genome-wide significance in a follow-up meta-analysis incorporating replication studies (Bis et al., 2018) . The other three variants are novel. This analysis also identified three variants in CST9 and STAG3 genes at suggestive level of significance p<5e-06 (Table 1) .\nIn the third analysis (using only APOE \u03b5 4 non-carriers), we identified four independent significant SNPs (p<5e-07) (Fig. 1C , Table S2 , Model 3) including the R47H mutation in TREM2 (HR=2.87, p=7.90e-14), rs144292455 in TACR3 (HR=4.22, p=2.22e-07) and rs111033333 in USH2A (HR=4.89, p=4.25e-08) found in the second analysis. One novel SNP was the rare variant rs56201815 in ERN1 within 17q23.3 locus (HR=4.22, p=7.21e-08, MAC=29). The HRs of the minor allele of these SNPs were substantial and comparable to that of APOE, which is not surprising because rare coding variants tend to show more significant biological effects, and the MAF of these SNPs in the ADSP sample is merely ~0.1%, much lower than the R47H mutation in TREM2. In addition, nine SNPs attaining p<5e-06 were identified (Table 1) .\nWe found that the p-values of the newly identified SNPs from the Cox models were much more significant, particularly for the rare variants, than those from a logistic model using the same ADSP sample and covariates (Fig. 1D) , explaining why these SNPs were not detected in the previous study. To examine whether the Cox model generally can increase power for detecting genetic variants associated with AD, we compared the p-values of well-established AD-related coding-variants in the ADSP WES data between the two models. We found that the Cox model produced more significant p-values for almost all SNPs except for the two SNPs in MS4A6A (Fig. 1D )."}, {"section_title": "Replication analyses confirm SNPs in ERN1, TACR3 and the MAPT region", "text": "The variants in TREM2, CLU and PILRA, identified using the full sample in our first analysis, were reported by previous larger studies (Jansen et al., 2019; Jonsson et al., 2013; Lambert et al., 2013) . Accordingly, we focus on replication of the novel findings identified in the analyses conditional on APOE \u03b5 4, and using the \u03b5 4-free sample. We attempted to replicate associations of 13 candidate SNPs with a p-value <5e-06 in at least one model in the discovery phase (Table  1) . These SNPs included six common variants (MAF5%) and six rare variants (MAF<1%). We further included rs2732703, an intronic variant of ARL17B in the MAPT region reported to be associated with AD in a previous study of APOE \u03b5 4 non-carriers (Jun et al., 2016) . This SNP is in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) with our identified coding variants rs199533 (r 2 =0.90) in NSF and rs12373123 (r 2 =0.93) in SPPL2C. We examined these SNPs in non-Hispanic white populations of LOADFS (3473 subjects, 43.4% cases, imputed genotypes), CHS (3262 subjects, 6.2% cases, imputed genotypes), GenADA (1588 subjects, 50% cases, imputed genotypes), and the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) cohort (1195 subjects, 45% cases, whole genome sequencing (WGS) genotypes) (Table  S1 ). We removed from the ROSMAP WGS cohort ~400 subjects, who were already included in the ADSP sample, resulting in 681 non-Hispanic whites. We did not exclude from LOADFS and CHS those subjects overlapping in ADSP as their proportion was small (475 for LOADFS and 834 for CHS) ( Table S6 ). The coxmeg R package (He and Kulminski, 2019) was used to analyze the LOADFS data set with a GRM estimated from a genotype array, and the coxph function in the survival R package (Therneau and Lumley, 2015) was used to analyze the CHS, GenADA and ROSMAP data sets.\nMeta-analysis of the results from the conditional model adjusted for APOE \u03b5 4 showed an improved p-value of 5.20e-09 for rs144292455 in TACR3 (MAF=0.093% in ADSP) compared to the ADSP sample alone (p=5.39e-08). This SNP had a p-value of 6.3e-03 when a logistic model instead of Cox model was fitted, which might be a reason for not identifying this SNP by the previous case-control study of ADSP (Bis et al., 2018) . The other SNPs did not reach the exome-wide significance of 5e-07 in the meta-analysis (Table 1) . Rs144292455 is a coding variant of TACR3 resulting in a premature stop codon and thus a shortened transcript. The minor allele of rs144292455 increased the risk of AD in ADSP (17 carriers, 16 cases), ROSMAP (2 carriers, 1 case), LOADFS (9 subjects with a dosage>0.5) and GenADA (1 subject with a dosage>0.5), while no imputed carriers were observed in CHS (Table S7 ). The vast majority of the minor allele carriers in ADSP (16 of 17; 3 of 16 carry also APOE \u03b5 4 allele) had AD with an average age-of-onset of 71.03 (Fig. 2C ). This age was substantially younger than the average age-of-onset of 75.4 years based on all AD cases. Two carriers in ROSMAP were both APOE \u03b5 4 non-carriers and the AD case carried APOE \u03b5 2/\u03b54 genotype.\nIn the analysis using APOE \u03b5 4 non-carriers, three SNPs (rs56201815, rs144292455, and rs12373123) showed smaller exome-wide significant meta-analysis p-values (p<5e-07) compared to those from the ADSP sample alone. Association for rs111033333 remained at the exome-wide significance. Replication of rare variant rs111033333 was, however, less reliable as no minor allele carriers were observed in ROSMAP, LOADFS, or CHS. The novel ADassociated SNP rs56201815 (meta-analysis p=4.88e-11) is a synonymous variant in ERN1. rs12373123, a missense variant of SPPL2C (Table 1) , is located in a large LD block spanning the MAPT region and it is in complete LD with multiple synonymous, nonsense or missense variants in CRHR1 and MAPT. In APOE \u03b5 4 non-carriers, the hazards of AD were consistently lower in the carriers of the minor allele of rs12373123 after age 70 (Fig. 2D ). It had a more significant p-value (meta-analysis p=4.76e-07) than the previously reported SNP rs2732703 (meta-analysis p=5.17e-06) and rs199533 (meta-analysis p=6.73e-07), suggesting that this SNP might be more correlated with the true causal variant for AD in this region. The minor allele of rs12373123 was consistently associated with decreased risk of AD in all studies except for LOADFS.\nMinor allele of rs56201815 in ERN1 increases the risk of AD Among the aforementioned replicated SNPs, rs56201815 in ERN1 yielded the most significant meta-analysis p-value, and its minor allele (G) (MAF=0.15% in a non-Finnish European sample (Lek et al., 2016) ) increased the risk of AD consistently across all studies and independently of the APOE \u03b5 4 allele. The HRs were nominally significant in LOADFS (p=1.97e-02) and CHS (p=6.66e-03). In GenADA, no carriers of the minor allele were observed. We analyzed the minor allele carriers in these studies in more detail. Twenty-seven (16 males) rs56201815-G carriers in ADSP (a total of 29 carriers in which two were excluded from the analyses because they transformed from control to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) during the follow-up in ADSP, and their AD status was unknown) were sampled from 11 cohorts including ACT, ADC, CHAP, MAYO, MIA, MIR, ROSMAP, VAN, ERF, FHS, and RS ( Table 2 ). The genotypes of these rs56201815-G carriers passed the quality control and had high sequencing depth. Of them, 23 subjects were diagnosed with AD and their average age-of-onset (73.5 years) was lower than the average age-of-onset (75.4 years) of all AD cases in ADSP (Fig. 2E) . Interestingly, three of the four rs56201815-G carriers in the control group carried APOE \u03b5 4 allele that explained why this SNP was only identified in the analysis of APOE \u03b5 4 non-carriers. Indeed, we observed that rs56201815-G had a stronger effect on the risk of AD in APOE \u03b5 4 non-carriers (Fig. 2F , Table  S2 ). In the ROSMAP WGS cohort (after excluding the duplicated subjects examined in the ADSP sample), we observed three rs56201815-G carriers, including one APOE \u03b5 4 carrier ( Table 2) . Two of the three carriers were diagnosed with AD, which, albeit from a small sample size, is much higher than the incidence of 36.7% in the non-carriers. The genotypes of all carriers had high sequencing quality. In the LOADFS cohort, we observed seven subjects with a dosage of rs56201815-G higher than 0.5 (Table 2 ). One individual was followed up until age 59 which is too young to be a useful subject for study of AD. Four out of the remaining six carriers had both AD and dementia, including three family members who were all diagnosed with AD (Table 2 ). This incidence (66.7%) was higher than that in non-carriers (43%). In the CHS cohort, we observed three subjects with a dosage of rs56201815-G higher than 0.5 (Table 2) , one of whom (33.3%) had AD during the follow-up, higher than the incidence (6.16%) in non-carriers.\nThe ADNI project was not included in the replication analysis because age-of-onset of AD was not available. Moreover, the vast majority of the ADNI WGS sample (738 subjects) was MCI or control subjects, and AD cases accounted for merely 5.8%. Instead, we investigated the association between rs56201815 and average FDG-PET intensity, one of the most accurate biomarkers to predict conversion from MCI to AD and to distinguish between control, early MCI (EMCI), late MCI (LMCI) and AD subjects (Caminiti et al., 2018; Landau et al., 2010 Landau et al., , 2011 Nozadi et al., 2018; Shivamurthy et al., 2014) , across five brain regions of interest (ROIs) (left/right angular gyrus, bilateral posterior cingulate gyrus, and left/right inferior temporal gyrus). We observed that the average FDG uptake of the five rs56201815-G carriers (two LMCI subjects, one EMCI subject, and two controls) adjusted for within-subject variability, age at measurement, sex, and diagnosis groups (control, EMCI, LMCI and AD) was significantly lower than that of the homozygous subjects (Fig. 3A) , suggesting that the rs56201815-G carriers had lower cerebral glucose metabolism and will more likely convert to advanced stages. rs56201815 is synonymous variant and brain-specific eQTL of ERN1 As rs56201815 in ERN1 was the most significant SNP identified from the discovery and replication phases, we next sought to examine its biological and regulatory functions. rs56201815 is a synonymous coding variant, indicating that it unlikely alters amino acid sequence of ERN1. However, rs56201815 is located in a CTCF binding site, an open chromatin region in multiple cell types and an evolutionarily conserved region (Fig. 3B ). Moreover, a recent mouse study reports that inhibition of ERN1 expression reduces amyloid precursor protein (APP) in cortical and hippocampal areas, and restores the learning and memory capacity of AD mice (Duran-Aniotz et al., 2017) . We therefore hypothesized that rs56201815 is a cis-eQTL of ERN1 in brain, and the detrimental effect of rs56201815 on AD is mediated by upregulating the expression of ERN1. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of rs56201815 on the expression of ERN1 using RNA-seq data in ROSMAP and GTEx, and microarray data in ADNI.\nWe collected 2213 RNA-seq samples from 838 subjects in the ROSMAP cohort in three brain regions including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and anterior caudate nucleus, among which four subjects were rs56201815-G carriers. Our differential expression (DE) analysis revealed that the minor allele of rs56201815 was significantly associated with increased expression of ERN1 (log(fold-change (FC))=0.204, p=0.0285) in PCC (Fig. 3C) . We then analyzed a WGS data set of 838 healthy subjects from the GTEx project. The WGS data included two rs56201815-G carriers. One of them had RNA-seq data in nine brain tissues including amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), hypothalamus, caudate, nucleus accumbens, putamen, cerebellar hemisphere, cerebellum and spinal cord. Despite the small sample size, our DE analyses indicated that rs56201815 was a potential eQTL of ERN1 in several regions in cerebrum, particularly nucleus accumbens (log(FC)=1.28, p=1e-4), and putamen (log(FC)=0.734, p=0.05) (Fig. 3D ). In line with the result from the ROSMAP data in PCC, rs56201815-G was correlated, albeit not significant (log(FC)=0.35, p=0.437), with the expression in ACC, leading to a significant meta-analysis p-value of 0.0213 for cingulate cortex. In almost all regions in cerebrum, the rs56201815-G carrier had uniformly higher expression of ERN1 than the average (Fig. 3D, Fig. S4A ).\nWe then investigated the effects of rs56201815 on ERN1 expression in other brain regions, and in four non-brain tissues including sigmoid colon, lung, spleen and whole blood. The RNA-seq data in sigmoid colon had two rs56201815-G carriers, and one rs56201815-G carrier was available in the other tissues. The DE results showed no evidence of association between rs56201815 and the gene expression in any of these tissues (Fig. S4A ). As the number of rs56201815-G carriers in the GTEx project is small, we further analyzed a peripheral whole blood sample from the ADNI project, comprising 733 subjects having both a WGS dataset and a microarray gene expression dataset, three of whom were rs56201815-G carriers with high sequencing quality. Our DE analyses of two probes in ERN1 showed that the minor allele rs56201815-G was not associated with either probe (Fig. S4B ).\nThese results suggested that rs56201815 was associated with elevated expression of ERN1 in cerebral regions (most predominantly in PCC and several regions in basal ganglia), but not likely in other tissues. To examine whether its regulatory effects in the brain are mediated by change of chromatin activity, we further carried out association analyses of epigenetic markers including DNA methylation and histone modifications in PFC. We collected an Illumina 450k array DNA methylation data set of 721 subjects (four rs56201815-G carriers) from a ROSMAP sample (De Jager et al., 2014 . Among 11 probes located in the region of ERN1, we found no evidence of significant association after adjustment for multiple testing (Table S3 ). The most significant probe (chr17:62134117), also the probe closest to rs56201815, was located in an enhancer with a p-value of 0.012. For histone modifications, we interrogated histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) peaks using a ChIP-seq data set of 632 subjects (four rs56201815-G carriers) from a ROSMAP sample (De Jager et al., 2018; Klein et al., 2019) . We conducted differential analyses of 26,384 broad peaks adjusted for fraction of reads in peaks (FRiPs), GC bias, and 10 remove unwanted variation (RUV) components. No significant association was found among nine broad peaks within a \u00b1200kb flanking region of ERN1 after adjustment of multiple testing although eight peaks showed slightly increased intensity in the carriers (Table  S4 ). The most significant association was in an enhancer at chr17:62,337,374-62,342,372 with a p-value of 0.043.\nPrevious studies show that rs12373123 is a cis-eQTL of multiple nearby genes (e.g., MAPT, CRHR1, and LRRC37A) in multiple tissues including brain (Gibbs et al., 2010; GTEx Consortium et al., 2017; Jun et al., 2016; Zou et al., 2012) , and shows chromatin interactions with these genes (Fig. 4A ). But it is not clear which cell type and genes mediate its effect on AD. We then explored the regulatory effects of rs12373123 at a cell-type level using a singlenucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) dataset. Cell type-specific analysis can also reduce potential confounding effects originated from unobserved heterogeneous cell type proportion across subjects in the tissue-level analysis, and therefore produces more accurate and refined estimates. We performed cell type-specific eQTL analyses using 44 subjects having both genotype data (39 subjects from WGS and 5 subjects from a SNP array) and snRNA-seq data from ~80,000 cells in PFC from a ROSMAP sample. We classified cells into excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) based on previous clustering results (Mathys et al., 2019) . We then aggregated cells within each cell type and each subject.\nIn each cell type, we interrogated 11 protein coding genes (10 genes within a \u00b1500kb flanking region and GRN, a nearby gene linked to frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTD), a type of dementia). The cell type-specific eQTL analyses revealed that one or more copies of rs12373123-C were significantly associated with elevated expression of ARL17B in all six brain cell types (p<1e-11) (Fig. 4B , Table S5 ). rs12373123 was also an eQTL of LRRC37A3, KANSL1, and CRHR1 in all cell types except for microglia (Fig. S2 , Table S5 ). The protective allele rs12373123-C was associated with elevated MAPT expression in astrocytes (p=0.01) while a decreasing trend in OPCs (p=0.09) (Fig. 4B , Table S5 ). We further found that rs12373123-C, particularly its homozygous protective genotype, was significantly associated with increased expression of GRN in microglia (p=3.65e-06) (Fig. 4B, Table S5 ), which is a protective gene against dementia and is important for lysosome homeostasis in the brain (Arrant et al., 2017; Holler et al., 2017) .\nWe also assessed the cell type-specific association between rs56201815 and the expression of ERN1. We observed that ERN1 was ubiquitously expressed in all brain cell types, most abundantly in microglia, followed by astrocytes and OPCs. As there was only one rs56201815-G carrier among the 39 WGS subjects, and, unfortunately, its total sequencing depth was much lower than that of the other subjects (~10% of the average library size), we investigated three major abundant cell types (excitatory neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes), for which the carrier had a library size > 50,000. We observed that rs56201815-G was slightly correlated with increased expression of ERN1 in excitatory neurons, but not significant (Fig. S3) .\nGene-set analysis identifies astrocyte, microglia and amyloid beta related pathways\nAs aggregating signals within a gene can often increase the statistical power, in particular, for detecting rare coding variants, we carried out gene-based analyses using the summary statistics of all examined SNPs estimated from the ADSP sample. Our gene-based analyses using MAGMA (de Leeuw et al., 2015) showed that TREM2 was the most significant gene associated with AD in all individuals (p=1.65e-9) and in APOE \u03b5 4 non-carriers (p=2.57e-10) (Fig.  S5A) , consistent with previous results (Bis et al., 2018) . Indeed, all six exonic SNPs (rs2234256, rs2234255, rs2234253, rs142232675, rs143332484, rs75932628) in TREM2 were at least nominally associated with AD (Table S2 ). Its significance in APOE \u03b5 4 non-carriers was higher, suggesting that the effects of TREM2 on AD were independent of APOE. In addition, multiple genes in the MAPT region including MAPT, KANSL1, NSF, and SPPL2C were significantly (p<3.5e-06) associated with the risk of AD in both analyses (Fig. S5B) . We also observed that CLU, TACR3, NAV2 and FAM186B were among the top associated genes.\nOur gene-set analysis using FUMA (Watanabe et al., 2017) based on the summary statistics from the exome-wide association analysis conditional on APOE \u03b5 4 detected one Gene Ontology (GO) gene set (positive regulation of astrocyte activation) associated with AD (Bonferroni adjusted p<0.05) (Fig. 5A ). Other top enriched gene sets included antigen processing and presentation via MHC class II, amyloid beta clearance and formation, response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and microglia activation (Fig. 5A) . Consistently, the gene sets related to astrocytes, microglia and amyloid beta were also among the top in the gene-set analysis using APOE \u03b5 4 non-carriers (Fig. 5B) . Our cell type association analysis using FUMA (Watanabe et al., 2019) showed that microglia was associated with AD among nine major cell types in the brain (p<0.05) in the analysis of APOE \u03b5 4 non-carriers (Fig. 5D ). No cell type was associated with AD based on the summary statistics from the association analysis conditional on APOE \u03b5 4 (Fig. 5C )."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this study, we interrogated association between 108,509 exome-wide SNPs and age-of-onset of late onset AD using Cox models with a sample consisting of ~20,000 AD patients and controls. We also attempted to identify SNPs contributing to earlier onset in APOE \u03b5 4 noncarriers alone. Most of these SNPs are rare variants. Our results not only confirm previously reported AD-related SNPs with much higher significance, but also reveal novel genetic variants associated with age-of-onset of AD, particularly in APOE \u03b5 4 non-carriers.\nOne of our major findings is a synonymous rare variant, rs56201815, in ERN1 (also known as IRE1). Our results showed that the minor allele of this SNP was associated with dramatically higher risk of AD, particularly in APOE \u03b5 4 non-carriers. Its huge effect size, unanimously replicated in three other cohorts, is not surprising as its MAF in the population is only ~10% of the rare variant rs75932628 in TREM2 according to ExAC (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/). ERN1 encodes a key protein, containing a serine/threonine-protein kinase domain and a ribonuclease (RNase) domain, involved in unfolded protein response (UPR) to ER stress by activating its downstream target XBP1 (Calfon et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2002) . Interestingly, a recent experimental study shows that proportion of activated ERN1 in postmortem brain tissue is associated with Braak stage of advanced AD patients (Duran-Aniotz et al., 2017) .\nDeactivation of the RNase domain of ERN1 in neurons reduces all hallmarks of AD including amyloid beta load, cognitive impairment, and astrogliosis in 5xFAD mice (Duran-Aniotz et al., 2017) . Moreover, ablation of eIF2\u03b1 kinase PERK, one of the three major UPR genes, also prevents defects in synaptic plasticity and spatial memory in AD mice (Ma et al., 2013) . Our findings show that the minor allele of rs56201815, increasing mRNA expression of ERN1 in multiple brain regions, also significantly increases the risk of AD, which corroborate these experimental results, and provide more evidence that responses to ER stress are probably involved in the causal pathway of AD.\nAging is the most important risk factor for late onset AD, indicating that certain risk factors during aging process might be implicated and required in the pathogenesis of AD. The UPR is one of the mechanisms disrupted during aging, resulting in augmented susceptibility to ER stress and accumulation of unfolded protein (Naidoo et al., 2008) . Previous studies show that aging leads to deficits in the systems involved in the defense against unfolded proteins in rat hippocampus (Paz Gavil\u00e1n et al., 2006) . Persistent ER stress in the central nervous system during aging can initiate apoptosis of neurons, and can trigger innate immune response in microglia (Sprenkle et al., 2017; Zhang and Kaufman, 2008) . Combined with the fact that many AD-related genes identified by GWAS are expressed exclusively in microglia, our findings indicate that the interaction between the UPR and innate immune system might play a critical role in biological mechanisms underlying AD.\nAs rs56201815, the variant rs12373123 in the MAPT region was also identified in APOE \u03b5 4 noncarriers. The minor allele of rs12373123 was associated with reduced susceptibility to AD in ADSP, ROSMAP, CHS, and GenADA. This SNP is located in an LD block spanning >400kb, and is in high LD with a large number of SNPs including multiple missense variants in MAPT, SPPL2C, CRHR1 and KANSL1. Previous GWAS show that rs12373123 and two nearby missense SNPs (rs12185268 and rs12373124) in complete LD with rs12373123 exhibit pleiotropic associations with numerous diseases and traits including intracranial volume (Ikram et al., 2012) , corticobasal degeneration (Kouri et al., 2015) , PD (Do et al., 2011; Hamza et al., 2010; Lill et al., 2012; Pankratz et al., 2012) , primary biliary cirrhosis (Liu et al., 2012) , red blood cell count (van der Harst et al., 2012) , and androgenetic alopecia . On the other hand, the major allele, more predisposed to degenerative diseases, is significantly associated with increased bone mineral density (Estrada et al., 2012; Morris et al., 2019) . Because SNPs contributing to age-related degenerative diseases are generally not subject to evolutionary selection (Kulminski, 2013; Nesse et al., 2012) , its major allele is probably selected by evolution due to its beneficial effect on bone mineral density. The results of our age-of-onset analyses indicate that this pleiotropic region might also be implicated in late onset AD, especially in APOE \u03b5 4 non-carriers. Our cell type-specific analyses reveal that rs12373123 is a cis-eQTL in different brain cells of multiple critical genes implicated in PD and FTD (e.g., MAPT and GRN), elucidating the regulatory mechanisms underlying its pleiotropy. Due to the involvement of tau protein in the etiology of AD and PD, the effect of rs12373123 on these diseases might be mediated by MAPT. Indeed, rs12373123 is in high LD with multiple missense SNPs (e.g., rs62056781 and rs74496580) in MAPT, and we found in the snRNA-seq data that rs12373123 is also an eQTL of MAPT in astrocytes. Our finding also suggests that the effects of rs12373123 can be mediated by increasing the expression of GRN in microglia, which is a key gene protective against FTD.\nIn addition, our results demonstrated strong advantages in statistical power of using a Cox model for age-of-onset traits than a logistic model for binary outcomes in the study of AD. The power gain in terms of p-values is evident for many well-known AD related SNPs in e.g., TREM2 and CLU, which all achieved more significant p-values than a previous study using the same cohort (Bis et al., 2018) . Despite a smaller sample size, the p-value of APOE \u03b5 4 in our analysis is much more significant than a recent large-scale meta-analysis of AD status (Jansen et al., 2019 ) and a previous analysis using a linear model of log-transformed age-of-onset (Naj et al., 2014) . Moreover, our age-of-onset analysis using a Cox model showed promising results in terms of statistical power for identifying rare variants compared to a logistic regression. An advantage of a Cox model over Poisson regression or logistic regression is that it implicitly accounts for age-varying hazards, a characteristic in many age-related diseases, e.g., AD (Hebert et al., 1995) . Our results in AD suggest that Cox models can have a power advantage for exploring rare variant association in other age-related diseases.\nAlthough our identified SNPs were validated in multiple independent cohorts, we acknowledge some limitations. The definitions and criteria of diagnosis of AD can vary across these cohorts. AD has certain similarity in the clinical and biological manifestation to other common neurodegenerative diseases such as FTD, which makes the clinical diagnosis of AD more complicated. In addition, two of our findings rs56201815 in ERN1 and rs144292455 in TACR3 are rare variants (MAF=~0.13% and ~0.09%), which had lower imputation quality compared to a common variant, especially for rs144292455. Most of our GWAS replication cohorts had moderate imputation quality for rs56201815. Although these SNPs showed solid associations in our meta-analyses, as the sample size of our WGS replication cohort is small, more GWAS studies using large-scale WGS or WES data are preferable to further validate these identified associations.\nIn conclusion, we identified three novel SNPs in ERN1, TACR3, and SPPL2C/MAPT-AS1 that exhibit strong associations with age-of-onset of AD. We also explored their regulatory consequences at tissue and single-cell levels in brain. These findings support the hypothesis of potential involvement of the UPR to ER stress and tau protein in the pathological pathway of AD, contributing to the understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying AD. Our findings are useful for guiding follow-up studies, and provide more insight into the molecular mechanisms and implication of the relevant genes in AD."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Phenotypes in age-of-onset GWAS", "text": "A total of 10,913 European-American participants used in the discovery phase of the exomewide age-of-onset association analyses of AD were collected from the ADSP project. These subjects were sampled from 24 cohorts, among which >3000 subjects were sampled from the ADC project (Table S6 ). The AD status of individuals used in the analyses was defined by clinical assessment based on NINCDS-ADRDA criteria of AD. All controls were cognitively normal individuals aged 60+. Details about study design and sample selection were described in (Beecham et al., 2017) . The AD status variable in the ADSP dataset was constructed based on information on prevalent and incident AD status from the updated dataset (Version 7 with release date on June 09, 2016) if available. Otherwise, information on prevalent and incident AD status as given in Version 5 (release data on July 13, 2015) was used. More specifically, a subject was treated as AD if either prevalent or incident AD status during the ADSP follow-up was observed. The age-of-onset variable was based on the same datasets as the AD status. In both versions (Version 5 and 7), all data for age-of-onset, which we received from dbGaP, were censored by age 90.\nFour cohorts (ROSMAP, LOADFS, CHS, GenADA) were included in the replication phase of the age-of-onset GWAS. To be consistent with the AD status in ADSP, AD status in ROSMAP was based on the clinical diagnosis of AD at the last visit. For AD cases, the age at first Alzheimer's dementia diagnosis variable was used as age-of-onset, which was also censored by age 90 if it was 90+. For controls, age-of-onset was calculated as age at the last visit or age at death if age at the last visit was not available. In LOADFS, some subjects had missing information about the age-of-onset of AD. For these subjects, we treated them as censored and set its age-of-onset as the age at the recruitment. In CHS and GenADA, the AD status and age-of-onset variables in phenotype files provided in dbGaP were used.\nGenotyping, Imputation, and Quality Control WES genotypes of bi-allelic SNPs mapped to hg19 from 10,913 ADSP participants were called using the quality-controlled Atlas-only pipeline at Baylor College of Medicine (We did not use the data from the GATK pipeline at the Broad institute due to known quality issues (https://www.niagads.org/adsp/data-notices)). More details about the production of the WES data in ADSP can be found in (Bis et al., 2018) . Variants with missing rate > 2% or MAC < 10 were excluded from the age-of-onset association analyses. After the filtering, 108,509 and 110591 variants remained in the analysis using all subjects and APOE \u03b5 4 non-carriers, respectively. VCF files of recalibrated WGS data from 1196 participants in ROSMAP were downloaded from the synapse website (https://www.synapse.org/). A total of 681 subjects were included in the replication phase after removing 16 discordant WGS samples, 17 duplicates and 477 subjects overlapping the ADSP sample. Genotyping of 3043 participants in CHS was performed using a HumanOmni1-Quad Illumina array. Genotyping of 3456 non-hispanic Caucasian participants in NIA-LOADFS was performed using a Human610-Quad Illumina array (~600K SNPs). Genotyping of 1588 non-hispanic Caucasian participants in GenADA was performed using two Affymetrix 250K arrays (a total of ~500K SNPs). More information about these cohorts can be found in (Gottdiener et al., 2000; Li et al., 2008; Wijsman et al., 2011) .

A dense GRM was first estimated from the original WES data based on the GCTA model (Yang et al., 2011) implemented in the SNPRelate R package (Zheng et al., 2012) . In the discovery phase of ADSP, we built a sparse GRM by setting any entry below 0.03 to zero. We evaluated five top PCs (PC1 to PC5) calculated from the dense GRM, and included the only significant PC2 in the analyses. We first estimated a variance component in the null model, which was then used to estimated HRs and p-values for all SNPs. We performed two analyses, (a) including all subjects with PC2, sex and the number of copies of APOE \u03b5 4 included as covariates, (b) including only APOE \u03b5 4 non-carriers with PC2 and sex included as covariates. We found that the estimated variance component was zero in the analysis (b), suggesting no evidence of random effects, and therefore we instead used a simple Cox model. The threshold to declare significant associations was calculated as 0.05 divided by the total number of tested SNPs. For comparison with analysis of AD status, we performed association analysis by fitting a logistic regression using the glm R function adjusting for the same covariates with the same sample.\nWe performed age-of-onset association analyses in LOADFS, CHS, ROSMAP, and GenADA for the top SNPs passing the suggestive threshold (p<5e-06) in the discovery phase. The same model and estimation procedures as in ADSP were used in LOADFS, which is also a familybased cohort. In LOADFS, the GRM was estimated from the genotype array data. The association analyses were conducted in the other three cohorts (i.e., CHS, ROSMAP and GenADA) using a Cox model implemented in the survival R package (Therneau and Lumley, 2015) because these cohorts consisted of unrelated subjects.

The cell type association analysis was also performed using FUMA (Watanabe et al., 2019) following the SNP2GENE procedure.
