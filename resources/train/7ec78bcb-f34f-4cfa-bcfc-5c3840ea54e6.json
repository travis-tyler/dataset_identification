[{"section_title": "", "text": "The study analyzed data on more than 8,000 firstand second-grade students in 110 schools in 12 districts in 10 states. In each of the participating school districts, schools were randomly assigned to use one of the four curricula. A random sample of approximately 10 students per classroom was included in the analysis. The study measured the relative effects of the four curricula by comparing end-of-year test scores on a nationally normed math assessment developed for the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten (ECLS-K) for first graders and on a similar assessment adapted for this study for second graders."}, {"section_title": "Features of the Four Elementary School Math Curricula Examined", "text": "Investigations in Number, Data, and Space: a student-centered approach that focuses on student understanding rather than specific problem-solving procedures Math Expressions: a blend of student-centered and teacher-directed approaches that emphasizes learning concepts through direct instruction and real-world examples Saxon Math: a teacher-directed approach that relies on scripted lessons and daily student practice and that focuses on teaching students procedures and strategies for problem solving Scott Foresman-Addison Wesley Mathematics: an approach that combines teacher-directed instruction with differentiated student activities and allows teachers to select relevant and appropriate materials, including manipulatives  (NCEE 2009-4052). The WWC rated that study in an earlier quick review (it can be found at: http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/ publications/quickreviews/QRReport.aspx?QRID=117). The study that is the subject of the current quick review examines (1) first-grade effects during the first year of curriculum implementation among all 109 study schools (both cohort-one and cohort-two schools combined), and (2) examines second-grade effects during the first year of curriculum implementation among the 71 cohort-two schools. 3 Absence of conflict of interest: This study was conducted by staff from Mathematica Policy Research, which also operates the WWC. For this reason, no staff from this organization participated in the review of the study. Quick reviews examine evidence published in a study (supplemented, if necessary, by information from author queries) to assess whether that study's design meets WWC evidence standards. Quick reviews rely on the effect sizes and significance levels reported by study authors. The WWC rating applies only to the summarized results, and not necessarily to all results presented in the study. (continued)"}]
