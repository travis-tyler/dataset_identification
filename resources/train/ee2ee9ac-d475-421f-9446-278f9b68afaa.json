[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Validated patient-reported outcome measures are potentially useful in clinical trials to supplement and confirm objective measures of physical function. Depression is a common comorbidity in MS, though its impact on patients rating of their abilities remains unknown. Methods: The Cleveland Clinic Mellen Center Knowledge Program (KP) database contains patient-reported (PR) and clinician-measured (CM) outcomes collected at every office visit in an IRB-approved database. Here, we include all definite MS patients with specified KP measures collected at a single visit from 11/2008 to 7/2012. Included KP measures are the PR Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) a validated depression measure in MS (0(none)-27(severe)) and the PR Multiple Sclerosis Performance Scales (MSPS) a measure of physical disability (0 (no problem)-41(unable)). The CM Timed-25 Foot Walk (T25FW) is cut off at 60 seconds. Bivariate and multivariate associations were estimated using regression (covaried for patient age, race, and sex). Results: 3507 MS patients are analyzed. In our cohort mean(SD) age=45.7(11.7), 73.5 % female, 84.2 % Caucasian, 69.4 % RRMS, MSPS=11.1(6.3), disease duration=11.6(9.8) years, T25FW=8.1(9.8) sec, dominant 9HPT=24.4(11.2) sec, PHQ-9=6.97(6.2) with 28.7 % indicating moderate or worse depression.

The Epilepsy Study Consortium reviewed seizure classifications and seizure diary descriptions for a once-aday trial of pregabalin for adult subjects with treatment resistant partial onset seizures enrolled in a multinational investigational study sponsored by Pfizer, Inc. The Consortium also reviewed diagnostic information to confirm the diagnosis of focal epilepsy. Methods: Sites were required to submit Seizure Identification and Diagnostic Review Forms (SIF/DRF) immediately following Visit 1. Each form contained a detailed description of the subject's seizures and classification. The site also completed a diagnostic review form, including neuroimaging and EEG reports. Discrepancies were followed up by one of the Consortiums reviewers until resolved. Subject randomization was only permitted after approval. Processes were also implemented to ensure consistency between the subject diaries and the seizure classifications. In addition, the seizures entered into the electronic case report forms (eCRF) were compared to the seizure classifications approved by the Consortium. If a seizure had not been approved by the Consortium, an eCRF query was issued asking the site to either complete a Seizure Identification Form with a description, or explain why the seizure type was entered into the database. Results: A total of 365 SIF and DRFs were reviewed. Four subjects did not meet entry criteria based on our review (4/365, 1 %). Of 325 randomized subjects, 324 seizure diaries were reviewed. Fifteen subjects had at least one misclassified seizure on the SIF and Seizure Diary (15/324, 5 %). Eight subjects had seizures that were correctly classified on the SIF but were misclassified on the diary (8/324, 2 %). Four of these subjects had two misclassified seizures. Based on our eCRF review, we instructed data management to query 15 of the 324 subjects (15/324, 5 %) . This revealed 257 data entry errors. Sites confirmed that these entries were entered incorrectly. Seventy two subjects had information entered incorrectly in one of the following: SIF, diary or eCRF (72/324, 22 %). A number of seizure diaries had the following issues: (1) descriptions in the seizure diary did not match what was approved in the SIF; (2) descriptions of seizure types that the subject did not have were provided; (3) seizure keys differed from visit to visit; (4) seizures that the subject experienced were omitted in error on the seizure key; (5) the letter was circled on the seizure key indicating the subject had that seizure type, however a description was not provided. Conclusions: Data errors in clinical trials can be avoided using specialists to provide an expert review. This can be performed in real time, without delaying subject enrollment. Even with our review of the SIF/DRF, seizure diaries and eCRF entries, the study still showed a high placebo rate of 35.8 percent, suggesting that further steps may be necessary to reduce study noise. Keith A Wesnes, PhD, Bracket, Swinburne University Background and Objectives: The seminal discovery that the human dentate gyrus (DG) retains its ability to generate neurons throughout life has raised the possibility of developing therapies to protect or promote such neurogenesis as it deteriorates due to ageing, insult and disease. The DG plays a crucial role in associative memory, and the degenerative changes which compromise neurogenesis in the DG are believed to contribute to memory disturbances in normal ageing and the early stages of AD. Pattern separation has been demonstrated to be under the control of the DG, and fMRI studies have identified the DG to be highly and selectively active when humans perform difficult visual object pattern separation tasks. The CDR System picture recognition task assesses visual object pattern separation, and in over 3000 healthy individuals (18 to 87 yrs) selective and marked age-related decline was seen in the difficult discriminations involving the DG. Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment were also selectively inferior on this discrimination compared to controls. This task thus offers the opportunity to assess DG activity in clinical trials. The aims of the present investigation were to examine various clinical conditions for evidence from this task of compromised DG activity, and thus potentially compromised neurogenesis. Methods: Various clinical populations who had performed the CDR System picture recognition task were examined for evidence of selectively compromised ability to make difficult discriminations. The conditions evaluated were late life depression, Huntington's disease, chronic pain, Parkinson's disease, oncology, schizophrenia, stroke, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and dementia with Lewy Bodies. Results and Discussion: Evidence of impaired neurogenesis was identified in many but not all of the clinical populations. Where it was identified, it was often consistent with preclinical data showing impaired DG neurogenesis. The task could therefore be a useful tool to evaluate the efficacy of novel compounds intended to promote, maintain or restore neurogenesis. Importantly the task could additionally serve as a non-invasive biomarker for compounds which may influence the DG. Results and discussion: The ADNI cohort showed no evidence of consistent or statistically reliable decline on any of the neuropsychological tests, in fact, 7 measures showed significant improvements, some lasting up to 5 years (effect sizes from 0.27 to 0.72). In contrast, most other assessments used in ADNI showed yearly declines, including cortical thickness and hippocampal volume. In contrast, the reference sample showed significant and consistent yearly patterns of decline on all automated tests (effect sizes from 0.5 to 1.8). The tests used in ADNI showed excellent test-retest reliability, which is thus not a sufficient criterion for test selection in such research. This analysis suggests that the nonautomated neuropsychological tests used in ADNI are unfit for the purpose of assessing change when used repeatedly in long term trials involving non-or mildly impaired cohorts. Preclinical Alzheimer's trials require sensitive and reliable instruments to capture the potential opportunity for therapies to slow the rate of cognitive decline. Tests designed specifically for repeated use in clinical trials when properly constructed can provide one solution."}, {"section_title": "A Review of 186 Clinical Trials Reporting Cognition Enhancement Using a Single Computerized System Designed Specifically for Clinical Neuroscience", "text": "Keith A. Wesnes, PhD, Bracket, Swinburne University Introduction: As human longevity steadily grows in more fortunate world regions; cognition enhancement has become a 'hot topic' and is currently arousing intense public and scientific debate. While definitions vary, cognition enhancement can be defined as improved ability to perform tasks involving mental ability; either by Abstracts from the ASENT 15th Annual Meeting counteracting impairment, or by producing improvement above existing levels. The principal and arguably only direct and objective measure of cognitive ability involves the use of tasks that demand mental efficiency. This paper concerns a computerized test system designed by the author which had its roots in a PhD project at Reading University (UK) which began in 1972 to determine whether the brain reticular cholinergic systems were involved in the control of human attention. It rapidly became evident that to detect subtle cognitive improvements in healthy students, automated procedures that captured cognitive reaction times as well as accuracy were essential. The early laboratory computers of the 1970s offered the first solutions, while portable laboratory microcomputers allowed cognitive testing to migrate from the laboratory to diverse clinical settings and even patients home in the early 1980s. One emerging question is whether diverse CNS disorders each require their own tailored cognitive test battery, or whether a single system covering a range of domains will be suitable for use across a range of CNS and other disorders. Methods: The system which emerged from this early research and upon which this presentation is based, the CDR System, has been used in almost 1400 trials worldwide. The core tests cover attention, information processing, working memory, executive control, and various aspects of verbal and non-verbal episodic memory. The core tests have remained constant over the last 29 years and have been supplemented with others. The public domain studies in which the system has identified cognition enhancement are reviewed in this paper. Three major domains are evaluated (1) Attention/information processing, (2) Working memory/executive control, and (3) Episodic memory. For each study the Tables indicate whether or not the domain was assessed, and if so whether significant improvement was identified, or significant impairment, or no reliable change. Results: The paper summarizes public domain data from 186 clinical trials conducted from 1975 to the present; 146 peer-reviewed papers; 28 published and 3 unpublished abstracts; 7 studies with negative results. The trials involve data from 5,765 healthy volunteers (age 5 to 90 years) and 8,185 patients from 33 different clinical conditions. The interventions include pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, natural products, everyday drugs including those of abuse, various surgical procedures and even classroom ventilation. Conclusions: To the author's knowledge, this is the largest database ever assembled of cognitive enhancement identified with a single test or test system. The answer to the question of whether a single system can be used in a diverse range of conditions to detect cognition enhancement appears to be a positive one. Further work will include the identification of the relative effect sizes of the various improvements in all of the studies."}, {"section_title": "Necdin Prevents Loss of Dopaminergic Neurons in Experimental Parkinson's Disease", "text": "Hideki Mochizuki MD, PhD, Toru Yasuda, Department of Neurology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine; Kazuaki Yoshikawa, Laboratory of Regulation of Neuronal Development, Institute for Protein Research, Osaka University; Yoshikuni Mizuno, Division of Neuroregenerative Medicine, Kitasato University School of Medicine Aberrant cell cycle events have been associated with neurodegenerative conditions in humans. These changes can be linked to neuronal cell death. This study was designed to assess neuronal protection provided by necdin, a potent suppressor of mitosis expressed predominantly in mature neurons. We exploited necdin-deficient mutant mice, recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vector-mediated gene transduction, and a wellvalidated and reproducible model of neurodegeneration, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2,3,6-tetrahydropyridie (MPTP)-induced dopaminergic (DA) neurodegeneration model of Parkinson's disease. Necdin ablation exacerbated DA neuronal cell loss induced by rAAV-mediated \u00b1-synuclein overexpression and MPTP treatment. In contrast, rAAV-mediated necdin overexpression almost completely abrogated MPTP-induced DA cell death. Our results indicate that necdin plays an important role in promoting the survival of DA neurons and suggest that this factor may be an excellent target for the development of efficacious neuroprotective therapies for patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases."}, {"section_title": "Altered Striatal Activity as a Therapeutic Target in Parkinson's Disease", "text": "Arun Singh, PhD, Lisa F. Potts, PhD, Klaus Mewes, PhD, Robert Gross MD, Mahlon R. DeLong, MD, Stella M. Papa, MD, Emory University School of Medicine\nThe loss of striatal dopaminergic modulation in Parkinson's disease (PD) presumably leads to abnormal discharges of striatal output neurons (medium spiny neurons, MSNs). To examine the MSN firing in PD, we analyzed data obtained during electrophysiologic mapping for DBS treatment in PD patients, along with dystonia and essential tremor (ET) patients for comparison. Strict criteria were applied for MSN classification. The mean firing rate of MSNs was significantly higher in PD (32\u00b19 Hz) than in dystonia (9.5\u00b14 Hz) and ET (<3 Hz). In PD, a larger fraction of striatal neurons also exhibited burst activity. These findings are aligned with previous data from parkinsonian monkeys, challenging the classic functional model of PD. The role of glutamatergic hyperactivity in these striatal changes suggests that manipulating the glutamate signaling is critical for improved responses to dopamine replacement. The less increased frequencies in dystonia highlight the relevance of specifically high MSN activity to PD, but also suggest that there may be grounds for the frequently alluded Dystonia-PD continuum. The very low firing rates in ET resemble MSN activity in normal monkeys, suggesting a parallel with normal humans. These findings demonstrate profound alterations of the MSN discharge in patients with PD, and point to the importance of investigating its molecular basis to develop function-restorative therapies."}, {"section_title": "Pregnancy Outcomes Following OnabotulinumtoxinA Exposure", "text": "Huiying Yang, MD, Ph.D, Jane Q. Li, MD, Department of Neurology, University of California, Irvine; Mitchell F. Brin, MD, Allergan, Inc. Department of Neurology, University of California, Irvine\nBackground: OnabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX\u00ae/BOTOX\u00ae Cosmetic) is a pregnancy category C pharmaceutical product in the United States FDA Pharmaceutical Pregnancy Categories. OnabotulinumtoxinA has been marketed globally for a variety of indications for >20 years, during which onabotulinumtoxinA pregnancy exposures have been reported. Two previous publications reported a total of 20 onabotulinumtoxinA-exposed pregnancies, of which one suffered a miscarriage and another had an elected abortion and no report of fetal malformations (Morgan JC, et al. J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2006; 77:117-119. Newman WJ, et al. Mov Disord 2004; 19:1384-5.) . The present study aimed to evaluate pregnancy outcomes following onabotulinumtoxinA exposure using a larger database. Methods: The Allergan global drug safety database, which in addition to adverse events reported to Allergan or observed in clinical trials, also contains spontaneous and clinical trial reports of pregnancy when onabotulinumtoxinA was either administered before or during pregnancy, was used to evaluate pregnancy outcomes. The database includes both prospective (pregnancy exposure reported before the outcome is known) and retrospective (the outcome was already known when the case was reported) pregnancy cases. The estimation of prevalence of pregnancy outcomes was limited to prospectively reported cases only, in order to minimize reporting bias. Results: We identified 466 pregnancies associated with maternal onabotulinumtoxinA exposure (Jan 1990 -Dec 2011 ; 198 out of the 466 had known pregnancy outcomes. Among these 198, the most frequently reported indications for which subjects were being treated with onabotulinumtoxinA were cosmetic (77, 38.9 %), hyperhidrosis (38, 19.2 %), and headache (21, 10.6 %). Of 136 with known dose information, 29.4 % received <50 U, 14.7 % 50-<100 U, 37.5 % 100-< 200 U, and 18.4 % received >200 U. Conclusion: Based on this review of reported pregnancies during 22 years of onabotulinumtoxinA utilization, the prevalence of abnormal pregnancy outcomes in mothers exposed to onabotulinumtoxinA-before or during pregnancy is consistent with background rates in the general population. We continue to collect outcome data on pregnancies from ongoing developmental and post-approval programs as well as from spontaneous adverse event reporting. Background: Connective tissue disorders are characterized by pain, inflammation, joint stiffness and degenerations, etc that pose major health problems to people of all ages, sex and professions. Drugs and physiatric treatments are due choices that relieve these conditions but in most cases, their adverse effects are repulsive and uncomfortable to the patients. The need to innovate a topical therapy that would minimize the discomforts and maximize healing effects is obviously necessary. Sciemed S4AC is a liquid formulary blend of Nimbin, Nimbidin and Azadirachtin chemical extracts, with natural minerals as diluents, designed topically for the management of neuralgia and rheumatic conditions. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety application of Sciemed S4AC topical on connective tissue disorders & human subjects. Method: 100 candidates were recruited, divided into 5 groups namely Control, Drug, Physical, S4AC & Combined. 20 candidates in each group. Candidates were medically examined and found qualified for this study. Ethical guidelines were followed. Control group was placed on placebo b.i.d, Anti-inflammatory drug, Ibuprofen 400 mg b.i.d were given to the drug and combined groups, massage therapy twice daily were given to the physical and combined groups, Sciemed S4AC was applied by subjecting S4AC group to soak their whole body into the warm liquid of S4AC or apply the liquidified S4AC bandage over their ailing part of the body twice daily. All therapies and placebo were administered twice daily for 90 days of a batch study. Result: All groups showed improvements except the control. S4AC group showed instant relief while the combined group showed significant long lasting improvements. Objectives: To improve the value, quality, speed, and efficiency of phase 2 trials, the NINDS supported NeuroNEXT network was created in the fall of 2011. NeuroNEXT offers an innovative infrastructure for collaboration with academia, private foundations and industry. Background: The NeuroNEXT Network consists of a Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC grant awarded to Massachusetts General Hospital), a Data Coordinating Center (DCC grant awarded to The University of Iowa) and 25 Clinical Study Sites (CSS). The Network is designed to facilitate, from initial conception through final analysis, clinical trials for neurological disorders in adult and pediatric populations by creating infrastructure that provides expert methodological, organizational and logistical support. Processes that have the potential to dramatically increase the quality and efficiency of multicenter clinical trials include the establishment of Protocol Working Groups made up of experienced trialists, a Central Institutional Review Board (CIRB), master contracts and a designated coordinator at each CSS to promote efficiency. Collaboration with academia, private foundations, and patient advocacy groups is promoted to improve and enhance recruitment and retention methods. Education, training, resources and mentorship to clinical investigators and research staff are also provided to create expert clinical trialists who are well trained to lead and conduct NeuroNEXT trials. Collaboration with industry is promoted to encourage industry engagement in the development of new neurological therapeutics. Design/Methods: The Network has created a CIRB and executed Master CIRB Authorization (Reliance) and Master Clinical Trial Agreements with all 25 CSS. Public and private websites and an Electronic Data Capture System have been developed. Protocol Working Groups (PWGs) have been established for all approved proposals to provide investigators with scientific, protocol and statistical design support and grant development assistance. All proposals undergo feasibility review by the NeuroNEXT Executive Committee. Those proposals greater than $500,000/year in direct costs also undergo internal NINDS review. Results: Since inception, a CIRB has been instituted and Master CIRB Reliance Agreements (average time from completion of site negotiation to execution: 25 days, range 1-43 days) and Master Clinical Trial Agreements (average time to execution: 50 days, range 4-168 days) have been executed with all 25 CSS. Since October 2011, 82 proposals have been submitted, 27 PWGs have been formed and 9 grants have been submitted. An additional 4 grants are anticipated to be submitted in April 2013. The proposals submitted cover 19 categories of neurological disorders consisting of adult, pediatric, biomarker, drug, device and rare/orphan disease studies that include 5 industry, 10 SBIR (small business) and 69 academic trials. The first NeuroNEXT study received CIRB approval and notification of the Notice of Grant Award on 8/16/2012. Time from initial protocol submission to CIRB approval was 55 days including the 2-week site review period. Time from final protocol submission to CIRB approval was 9 days. The average time from individual site submission to CIRB approval was 12 days, range 1-44 days. The Investigator Meeting was held on 9/6/2012-9/7/2012, the first site was activated by 11/14/2012 and enrolled the first subject on 12/14/2012. 11/15 sites were activated by 1/7/2013. Site activation required each site evaluator to complete training and intra-rater reliability testing. Conclusion: The NeuroNEXT Network has successfully created and implemented systems, programs and processes that enable academia, private foundations, industry and investigators to partner to promote greater quality and efficiency in NINDS clinical trials. Introduction: Malignant infarction is characterized by the formation of cerebral edema, and decompressive craniectomy (DC) is the only proven therapy. The NC (Ca-ATP) channel, regulated by the SUR1 receptor, is blocked by the sulfonylurea drug glyburide, which attenuates brain water content in preclinical models of large stroke. A phase I study has been safely completed. We assessed the hypothesis that a pilot study of RP-1127 (Glyburide for Injection) in patients at high risk for malignant infarction was safe and feasible. Methods: The objective of this four-center prospective, open label, phase IIa trial was to assess the safety and feasibility of treating severe anterior circulation ischemic stroke patients with RP-1127, whether or not treated with IV rtPA. The study enrolled patients with a baseline MRI DWI lesion between 82 cm3 and 210 cm3, age 18-80 years, and time from symptom onset to drug infusion of d 10 hours. Patients received a RP-1127 bolus followed by continuous infusion for 72 hours.\nResults: Recruitment of 10 patients was completed within 9.6 months. The mean initial DWI lesion volume was 102\u00b1 23 cm3. There were no serious adverse events related to the drug. The incidence of malignant edema was 20 %, compared to 88 % in a prospective observational study with DWI e82 cm3. Further, 8/10 patients did not require any bolus osmotherapy or DC. The mean increase in ipsilateral hemisphere volume was 50\u00b133 cm3 compared to historical controls of 71.5\u00b127 cm3. The proportion of 30 day mRS d 4 was 90 % compared to 23.8 % (at 12 months) in control patients from a pooled analysis of DC trials. Conclusions: These findings suggest that a Phase II trial for patients at risk of malignant infarction is feasible and will provide important insights into the safety and potential efficacy of RP-1127."}, {"section_title": "Delivering therapy to target: improving odds for successful drug development", "text": "Raghu Raghavan, PhD, Therartaxis Ensuring delivery of a therapeutic agent to diseased tissue at concentrations sufficient to heal or kill cells is a critical component of the drug development process. Delivery outside the target area should also be minimized to reduce damage to other cells. In the first part of this talk we discuss the direct delivery of biologic agents into brain tissue and the failures of drug trials in brain cancer and Parkinsons disease in which we and others have shown that inadequate delivery alone could be sufficient to explain the failures. We outline the problems facing direct delivery of agents to brain, as well as to solid tumors such as prostate cancer. We also point out, based on our simulations and observations, that the systemic delivery of chemotherapeutics for brain cancer faces similar issues. We then discuss the needed advances to ensure proper delivery to intended sites which we and others are developing. In order to achieve optimum therapeutic benefit targeted delivery of therapies must take into account both (i) the molecular characteristics of therapeutic agents, and (ii) the physiological characteristics of the tissue. These sets of properties may be considered a matrix with many entries. We believe that quantitative as well as \"real-time\" imaging, customized simulations using data from that imaging, and device designs that optimize the drug-device combination for each entry in the matrix can significantly enhance both patient benefit and drug development. We will present the matrix and select two examples from our research for detailed study to show how combined imaging, modeling, and device design can be used to obtain desired dose patterns. We conclude by demonstrating how these methods generalize to other cases and how a workflow for therapeutic delivery using these methods can speed up therapeutic development and improve patient therapy."}, {"section_title": "FPO1 to Treat Cough Via a Combination of Peripheral and CNS Effects", "text": "James Vornov, MD, PhD, Cerecor, Inc.\nCough is the most common presenting symptom in patients seeking primary medical care. Chronic cough is defined as a cough that persists for >8 weeks; it is frequently associated with interstitial lung disease, asthma, GERD, and upper airway diseases (e.g., allergic rhinitis). Treating these underlying conditions can lead to clinical improvement, but often the cause is either indeterminate (idiopathic cough) or not fully responsive to available treatment. In these circumstances, antitussives are needed to limit psychosocial and somatic sequelae, such as sleep deprivation, depression, incontinence, vomiting, and rib fractures. Chronic cough carries a significant socioeconomic burden and has an estimated prevalence of~10 % worldwide. Despite advances in the treatment of its underlying causes, cough remains a condition for which symptomatic treatments are ineffective. There are no safe and effective antitussives currently available and virtually no promising candidates undergoing development at this time. The mainstays of symptomatic antitussive therapy, dextromethorphan (DXM) and codeine, were introduced 50 years ago, are no better than placebo in the majority of clinical efficacy studies, and have high abuse potential. Codeine is an opiate. DXM is an NMDA receptor antagonist and sigma receptor agonist with sedative and hallucinogenic properties that are dose-limiting. Studies in the guinea pig citric acid model of cough have demonstrated that the sensitivity of the cough reflex is under CNS control and that centrally acting receptor blockade of systems involved in central modulation of pain pathways exert antitussive effects. A human proof of concept study in the capsaicin-induced model of cough showed reduction in sensitivity in healthy volunteers as well as in subjects with cough hypersensitivy following an upper respiratory infection. Based on these results, Cerecor is currently conducting a Phase II trial with a novel product, FP01 to treat cough via a combination of peripheral and CNS effects. In this placebocontrolled, double blind 2 week cross-over study, a validated cough counting system serves as the primary endpoint.

Salinas, MD, MSc, StemCells, Inc.\nThe potential of regenerative medicine is based on administering healthy cells into defective tissues in order to correct the pathophysiological processes in given diseases. The cellbased experimental therapies under development include the use of embryonic, induced pluripotent (iPS), or adult (tissue-derived) stem cells. We report in this presentation the significant advances achieved using adult human central nervous system stem cells (HuCNS-SC\u00ae), proprietary self-renewing, multi-potent adult stem cells purified, expanded and banked from donated human brain tissue. These cells, isolated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) targeting high plasma membrane expression of CD133 and negative to low expression of CD24, are expanded to produce working cell banks that are eventually cryopreserved before becoming a final product for human trials. Preclinical proof of concept studies with HuCNS-SC cells have been reported in several animal models including traumatic spinal cord injury, Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis, hypomyelinating disorders, cerebral ischemia, retinal degeneration and Alzheimers disease. In those in vivo experiments, xenogeneic HuCNS-SC cells were able to engraft, migrate, and differentiate preferentially into neurons, astrocytes or oligodendrocytes. More importantly, those studies demonstrated the cells reparative functional potential. Based on the substantial preclinical evidence, four phase I clinical studies in different neurological indications were initiated with the aim to: 1) assess the safety, feasibility and tolerability of the transplanted cells, surgical administration and transient immunosuppression, and 2) measure signs of functional activity. Phase I studies in Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis and Pelizaeus Merzbacher Disease have been completed and two Phase I/II studies in traumatic spinal cord injury and dry age-related macular degeneration, respectively, are currently ongoing. To date, a total of 16 patients have undergone HuCNS-SC transplantation.

This specificity and association with the critical antigen presentation mechanism offers the promise of good efficacy as shown in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) models in DR2 transgenic mice, but with significant safety advantages compared newer disease-modifying agents that affect T-cell migration, deplete immune cells in general, or alter cytokine profiles.

PV-267 had no significant effect on T cell responses mediated by other MHC class II molecules including HLA-DR1, -DR4, or DR9. Importantly, PV-267 did not induce nonspecific immune activation of human PBMC.

Krafft, PhD, Acumen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nSoluble A oligomers inhibit synaptic function, trigger early memory deficits and initiate neurodegeneration. These non-fibrillar assemblies are now recognized as key culprits in Alzheimers disease (AD), and represent a highly attractive intervention target for Alzheimer's disease. Here we report on ACU-193, a promising new drug candidate that exhibits high selectivity for soluble A oligomers and potent capability to block their synaptotoxicity. ACU-193 is a humanized, affinity matured IgG2 monoclonal antibody, engineered to minimize cellular effector functions and immunogenicity. ACU-193 binds soluble A oligomers with low nanomolar affinity, exhibits >500-fold selectivity for soluble A oligomers versus A monomer and fibrillar A , and does not exhibit cross-reactive binding to other proteins. In cultured hippocampal neurons, ACU-193 potently blocks synaptic binding of soluble A oligomers, and its efficacy is not affected by the presence of excess A monomer. In vivo ACU-193 target engagement and behavioral efficacy were demonstrated by administration to Tg-AD mice, which afforded dosedependent complex formation with soluble A oligomers in brain tissue, reduction in plaque deposition, and significantly reduced abnormal nocturnal hyperactivity. In mice, rat, dog, and monkey, ACU-193 showed linear, dose-dependent pharmacokinetics, bio-distribution and brain penetration typical of other CNS-directed antibody drugs. Exploratory animal toxicity studies of ACU-193 revealed an overall excellent safety profile. Highyielding, stable cell lines have been established for efficient production. Human dosing is expected to deliver brain levels of ACU-193 >200-fold higher than measured soluble A oligomer levels in AD CSF. Thus, ACU-193 is expected improve synaptic and cognitive function in AD patients. Biomarker assays to measure the drug-target complex and levels of soluble A oligomers in CSF have been developed to support clinical studies of ACU-193. These assays should allow patient selection and stratification and serve as a companion diagnostic. ACU-193 is expected to deliver acute behavioral benefits and chronic disease modification benefits. Clinical develop plans reflect the availability of biomarker assays and the expectation that behavioral efficacy is achieved relatively quickly. It is anticipated that initial evidence for efficacy will be obtained in a Phase Ib study of relatively short duration and low cost. The neuropeptide galanin and its associated receptors play an important role in controlling neuronal excitability. Systemically active galanin analogs, therefore, represent potential first-in-class therapies for the treatment of pain, epilepsy and other neurological disorders. We previously described prototype galanin-based analogs that were metabolically stable, systemically bioavailable, and penetrated the blood-brain-barrier (Bulaj et al., J.Med Chem. 2008) . The initial lead compound, NAX-5055, displayed potent activity following i.v., i.p. or s.c. administration in rodent models of epilepsy and pain (White et al., Neurotherapeutics 2009 , Bialer et al. Epilepsy Res. 2010 ). Furthermore, we described a rational approach to engineering systemically bioavailable galanin analogs that can discriminate between galanin receptors-1 and -2 (Robertson et al., J. Med Chem. 2010 ). This approach resulted in a new series of galanin receptor-2 preferring analogs with improved safety and efficacy profiles. Galanin receptor-2 preferring analogs are potently active in the mouse 6 Hz and corneal kindled seizure models. More recently we reported on a strategy for developing modified neuropeptide analogs that act on the peripheral nervous system and avoid brain penetration (Zhang et al., Mol Pharm. 2013 ). Both peripheral acting and CNS penetrating galanin receptor-2 based analogs are active in mouse models of persistent and inflammatory pain and the rat partial sciatic nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain. These results demonstrate that through rational design we can produce metabolically stable galanin analogs that act on the central and/or peripheral nervous systems and alter their preference for galanin receptor-1 versus galanin receptor-2. Ongoing studies will further define the efficacy and safety profile of these galanin receptor-2 preferring lead compounds for the treatment of pain and pharmacoresistant partial seizures. The selective block of N-type calcium channels has been shown in both animal models and human clinical trials to be highly efficacious in alleviating several types of chronic and neuropathic pain. Genetically altered mice null for the \u00b11 2 N-type channel gene exhibited marked decreases in chronic and inflammatory pain responses and generally showed normal acute nociceptive responses. Z160 is a selective N-type calcium channel blocker with preferential binding to the inactivated state. Z160 consequently demonstrated use-dependent block of N-type channels, with significantly greater potency at higher stimulation frequencies similar to the action potential firing rate typical of neurons processing pain signals. After oral administration in the Chung and Chronic Constriction Injury rodent models of neuropathic pain, Z160 demonstrated dosedependent reduction of thermal hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia at levels comparable to morphine, \u00c9-conotoxin and gabapentin with no motor effects as measured by rotarod performance. An early oral formulation of Z160 was characterized by poor bioavailability especially under fasting conditions. A new formulation was developed with improved bioavailability and reduced food effect. Z160 was well tolerated in single and multiple dose studies in healthy subjects without evidence of sedation. Z160 is in Phase II clinical trials in lumbosacral radicular pain and postherpetic neuralgia.

Romach, MSC*, MD, FRCPC, *INC ALO-02 is a combination oxycodone/naltrexone capsule in development for chronic pain. The capsule consists of pellets with extended-release oxycodone surrounding a sequestered core of the opioid antagonist naltrexone. ALO-02 is being developed for treatment of chronic pain with oxycodone and possibly mitigates misuse and abuse by the inclusion of naltrexone. . Misuse or abuse of ALO-02 by tampering, crushing or chewing the pellets would cause the rapid release and absorption of both oxycodone and naltrexone and dampen the euphoric effects of oxycodone. The development program consists of two preliminary studies to determine the appropriate ratio of naltrexone to oxycodone and subsequent studies with the selected ratio including Phase I studies, a longterm safety study, an efficacy study in patients with lowback pain, and three studies examining abuse potential by the oral, nasal, and intravenous routes. Determining the correct percentage of naltrexone is key a decision for this compound. The two dose-ratio studies assessed the impact of coadministration of oxycodone with naltrexone percentages of 4-24 % in non-opioid dependent subjects with histories of recreational opioid use. In the two studies, Drug Liking VAS was a primary endpoint measured as peak effect (E max ) on a 100 point bipolar scale (i.e. like/dislike) over 24 hours. In both studies, 60 mg oral oxycodone was compared to the various ratios of oxycodone/naltrexone. The first study tested oxycodone/naltrexone ratios of 4-20 % while the second study tested ratios of 12-24 %. The combination of oxycodone with 12 % naltrexone provided acceptable and consistent reduction in Drug Liking compared to oxycodone alone across the two studies. Consistent reductions were noted with other endpoints (Drug High, Overall Drug Liking, Subjective Drug Value) with the 12 % oxycodone/naltrexone ratio which was chosen as the ratio for further development. Aicardi Gouti\u00e8res Syndrome (AGS) is a devastating, progressive pediatric neurologic disorder of the innate immune system for which there is currently no effective treatment. This inherited encephalopathy affects newborn infants and children usually resulting in severe mental and physical handicaps. AGS is now understood to be caused by mutations in a series of genes encoding a series of nucleases and similar proteins, which result in the accumulation of immune stimulatory nucleic acids within the cell. There is subsequent downstream activation of interferon mediated immune pathways, with devastating effects to the brain and skin. We present exciting preliminary data to explain the pathogenesis of AGS, specifically increases in interferon induced genes in AGS patients versus controls, elevations in cytokine panels and CSF and blood cell immunophenotyping. These findings have profound implications for new strategies for treatment. Specifically, widely used and safe therapies targeting cellular reverse transcription machinery, such as antiretroviral therapy, may be of significant clinical benefit in reducing disease progression in patients with AGS. Treatment with antiretrovirals offers the exciting possibility of a safe, approved treatment that may abrogate disease activity at its source, ie decrease the presence of immune stimulatory DNA within the cell. Additionally, disease specific increases in interferon signaling genes and specific circulating immune cells suggest that disease pathways could be further interrupted using modulation of interferon pathways. These data suggest that in rare disease, identification of a underlying molecular etiology and mechanism of disease can lead to possible therapeutic approaches using the existing pharmacologic arsenals available to neurologists, offering hope in other orphan disorders.
