[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "US research universities are heavily populated by postdoctoral fellows. Indeed, by the National Science Foundation (NSF)'s count there were approximately 30 000 postdoctoral appointees in science and engineering at US universities in the fall of 2001. 1 Only ten years earlier, the number of postdocs stood at slightly less than 23 000. Eleven universities currently have 500 or more postdoctorates on campus working in the fields of science and engineering. Harvard University heads the list with 1596, followed by the University of California, Berkeley (819), the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (808) and the University of Colorado (796). In terms of the distribution, the top ten universities host almost 25 percent of all postdoctorates in science and engineering and the top 20 host almost 40 percent. 2 Because postdocs are usually recruited by research faculty and funded through research grants going directly to the faculty principal investigator, university administrators have traditionally paid little attention to their presence and, when asked, often have had difficulty in identifying the postdoctoral population working on their campus. 3 However, as the number of postdocs has increased and their job prospects for an independent research career have declined, the level of their professional dissatisfaction has grown and universities have begun to realize that the complex set of issues related to postdocs can no longer be ignored. A statistic that communicates in part the emerging tension on campuses surrounding postdocs is that there are currently 50 known active postdoc associations on campuses, including those of Stanford, Yale, Johns Hopkins, the University of Illinois and the University of Chicago. The postdoc position has a long tradition in the United States, especially for certain science and engineering fields. In such fields, for new PhDs with an interest in pursuing an academic career at a research university, the postdoctoral position has become almost a necessary condition given that departments, when making tenure-track hires at the rank of assistant professor, generally direct their searches to the postdoctoral pool instead of those who have just received their doctoral degree. For example, for decades the typical career path of a research life scientist in the United States has involved obtaining a postdoctoral position upon the receipt of a PhD. As of April 1995, approximately two-thirds of the tenured or tenure-track faculty in biology who have received their doctoral training in the US have held at least one postdoctoral position after obtaining their doctoral degree. 4 Two dimensions of postdoctoral training have changed over the years, however, leading to a dramatic increase in the number of postdocs populating university campuses. One involves the increasing number of new PhDs taking a first postdoc position, including individuals who received their doctoral training abroad as well as individuals from fields that traditionally did not include postdoc work as a component of training. The other involves a lengthening of the duration of individuals' postdoc experience. In earlier years, individuals typically stayed in a postdoctoral position for only two years. This no longer is the case. For example, 35 percent of life science PhDs observed in 1999 were in postdoctoral positions three to four years after graduation, compared to 12 percent in 1977; 20 percent held postdoctoral positions five to six years later, compared to 5 percent in 1977. 5 In this paper, we examine factors contributing to both of these trends. In Section 2 we present some summary data collected by the NSF on all postdoctoral appointments in science and engineering fields. These data are for all postdoctorates in these fields including those who received their doctoral degrees abroad. In Section 3 we estimate the propensity of new PhDs to take a postdoctoral position. In Section 4 we examine factors that affect the duration of postdoctoral experience by estimating a model of postdoctoral duration for individuals who have held one or more postdoctoral positions. We are particularly interested in how these outcomes relate to the academic labor market for scientists and engineers, as well as the availability of research funding. Due to data availability, the analysis in Sections 3 and 4 is limited to individuals who received their PhDs in the United States."}, {"section_title": "The US postdoctorate population", "text": "In this section, we present some summary statistics on the postdoctorate population in the doctorate-granting institutions) in the US and outlying areas. The purpose of the GSS survey is to obtain the number and characteristics of graduate science and engineering students and postdoctorates in US institutions. Data items for the survey are collected at the academic-department level. For postdocs, the survey collects information on postdoctoral trainees regardless of where their degree was awarded. Table 1 presents the number of postdocs from 1987-2001 by broad field category. 6 We see that the number of postdoc positions in science has grown dramatically in the period 1987-2001, increasing by almost 60 percent. During this period, the number of postdocs in engineering has more than doubled. By contrast, the number of postdocs in the biological sciences, which started the period with a very large base, has grown by slightly more than 60 percent. One factor that has contributed to the rise in the postdoc population relates to the increasing propensity to hire postdocs from those who have received their PhD training abroad. Although NSF does not collect data by country of doctorate, in recent years it has collected data by citizenship status. In 2001, 59.7 percent of all postdoctorate appointees in the US were temporary visa holders, up from 53.6 percent in 1998. 7 "}, {"section_title": "The propensity to take a postdoctoral position", "text": "We draw on data from the annual Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) to estimate the propensity of a newly minted PhD from a US institution to accept a postdoctoral position upon graduation. The SED is the census of all PhDs awarded in the United States and is conducted by the NSF and administered by academic institutions at or near the time individuals receive their PhDs. For what types of employer will you be working within the next year? The response rate of the SED is high, with more than 90 percent replying to the survey instrument each year. For the 2001 survey, the response rate was approximately 92 percent. We limit our study to those trained in one of ten broad fields in science and engineering for the period 1981 to 1999 who indicate that they do not plan to be in a foreign country after graduation. These ten broad fields are agriculture, physics, astronomy, chemistry, computer science, earth science/oceanography, engineering, mathematics, health/medical and biology. In our sample, approximately 64 percent of the respondents indicate that they have made definite plans for work or future study at the time they complete the questionnaire. Another 26 percent indicate that they are negotiating with a specific organization, or more than one; seeking appointment but have no specific organization in mind at this time; and other. Together these activities are referred to as \"seeking.\" The plans of the remaining 9 percent are not known. We distinguish, where possible, between those taking a postdoctoral appointment at an academic institution and those taking a postdoctoral position in another sector, such as industry or government. The distinction can be made clearly only for those with definite plans since many of those \"seeking\" do not indicate the sector where they are new PhDs with definite plans to take a postdoctoral appointment, 70 percent were headed to academe; the other 30 percent were headed to another sector. Here we examine the propensity to take a postdoctoral position for those who have definite plans as well as for the larger group of individuals that includes those seeking a position. We define individuals to have definite plans if they are returning to or continuing in pre-doctoral employment or if they have signed a contract or made a definite commitment. The \"seeking\" group includes individuals who are negotiating with a specific organization, or more than one; seeking appointment but have no specific organization in mind at this time; and other. We define a postdoctoral appointment to be a postdoctoral fellowship, a postdoctoral research associateship, a traineeship or \"other study, internship, residency.\" The independent variables in the model are defined in Table 2; means and standard deviations are also presented. In the model, we control for demographic characteristics such as age and gender, citizenship status, marital status, number of dependents and field of doctoral study. We also include variables to indicate whether the respondent worked full time or part time during the last year in graduate school, and whether the respondent attended a top-ten graduate program in the field. Table 2 shows that for most variables, the means for the \"definite\" group and the combined group of the \"definite\" and the \"seeking\" are similar. One notable difference is that a higher proportion of those with definite plans are US citizens. The coefficients for the logit equation, estimating the odds that an individual has definite plans to take a postdoctoral position, are presented in Table 3 as well as the standard errors. For ease of exposition we present not only the actual logit coefficients but also the more easily interpreted odds-ratio. By way of example, for a dummy variable such as female, a value of 1.0 of the odds-ratio indicates that the odds of the event in question occurring are the same for women as for men, the benchmark. An odds ratio greater than 1.0 (for example 1.5), tells us that the odds of the event in question occurring for women are 1.5 times those for men or 50 percent higher for women than for men. 8 The results are presented for the \"definite\" group as well as for the \"definite and seeking\" group. The findings are fairly straightforward. We see that relative to biologists (the benchmark), PhDs in all the other nine fields are less likely to take a postdoctoral position. Results for the \"definite and seeking\" group show that the field with the lowest likelihood of taking a postdoctoral position, other things equal, is computer science with an odds ratio of 0.049. This suggests that computer science PhDs are about 5 percent as likely to take a postdoctoral position as PhDs in biology. Other than biology, the field with the highest likelihood is astronomy with an odds ratio of 0.78, indicating astronomy PhDs are 78 percent as likely to take a postdoctoral position as biology PhDs. Where the individual trains matters as well. In seven of the ten fields, those graduating from a top-ten program in their field are more likely to take a postdoctoral position than those who did not train at a top-ten program. 9 But exceptions occur: for example, graduates from top-ten programs in engineering are significantly less likely to take a postdoctoral position-an indication, no doubt, of the strength of the market in engineering during this period, especially outside the academic sector. Personal attributes affect the likelihood of taking a postdoc. Ceteris paribus, older individuals are less likely to accept postdoctoral positions, 10 as are married individuals. The probability of being a postdoc is also negatively related to the number of dependents (other than spouse) that the individual has. These results are consistent with the theory that postdoctoral training is seen as an investment in additional human capital. Thus, individuals who have shorter horizons or capital constraints are less likely to opt for the investment. Our results also indicate that what the individual did during the last year in graduate school is also important. Not surprisingly, those who worked full time are considerably less likely to take a postdoc position; those who had a fellowship are considerably more likely to take a postdoc position. Citizenship status also matters, as does the country of undergraduate training. We consistently find that US citizens or permanent residents are less likely to take a postdoctoral position compared to those who have temporary visas (the benchmark). A likely reason that individuals on temporary visas may be more likely to take a postdoctoral position than those who are not temporary residents is that in many cases postdoctoral positions are classified as training positions, which allow such individuals to remain in the United States after receiving their PhD. We also find that those who received their bachelor's degree in the United States, other things being equal, are less likely to take a postdoctoral position. The results also indicate that the odds of taking a postdoctorate position are consistently higher for those who received their PhD degree after 1981, the benchmark year. Beginning in 1983 the year coefficients are positive and highly significant. The odds ratios show a consistent increase over time through 1994, with a significant dip in the years 1996-1999. By way of example, individuals who got their PhD degree in 1994 were 2.3 times as likely to take a postdoctoral position as those who received their degree in 1981, while those who got their degree in 1998 were only 1.35 times as likely. This could be related to the overall job market boom in the mid-to late 1990s. Table 4 reports similar results, but this time the period is restricted to 1981-1995 so that we can distinguish those taking a postdoc in academe from the larger group. The sample is restricted to those with definite plans. Prior to discussing the academic results, we note that when the dependent variable remains indicative of a postdoctoral position regardless of sector, the results for this abbreviated period of time (1981-1995) remain fairly consistent with the above findings for the extended period of time (1981)(1982)(1983)(1984)(1985)(1986)(1987)(1988)(1989)(1990)(1991)(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999). The only exception is that the fellowship variable is no longer significant. The results are fairly similar when we focus on those taking a postdoc position in academe rather than those taking a postdoctoral position regardless of sector. The only major difference is that those coming from top physics programs are no longer more likely to take a postdoc than their peers from non-top-ten programs. We also find that there is no significant difference between the probability of taking a postdoc in the years 1990 and 1991 and the benchmark year 1981. We have no clear explanation related to this finding. One objective of this research is to determine the degree to which the probability of taking a postdoctoral position relates to the job market (especially the job market in academe) for newly minted scientists and engineers. Measures of the strength of the job market are notoriously difficult to construct. For example, information on academic job vacancies is not readily available. Here we use two alternative measures of the job market. One is supply-oriented and controls for the number of PhDs minted each year by field. The other is demand-oriented, and controls for the total current fund revenue for all private and public institutions to proxy the demand for PhDs by academe. We find the probability of taking a postdoc to be negatively and significantly (at the 1 percent level) related to the percent change in current fund revenue. This is true regardless of whether we focus on the population of \"definite and seeking\" or simply the population that has definite plans. It also holds when, for the latter group, we examine the probability of holding an academic postdoctoral position, rather than a postdoc regardless of sector. For the more inclusive time period, 1981-1999, we use the percent change in total current fund revenue for public institutions as a measure of demand for PhDs by academe. Again, we find a negative and highly significant relationship between the demand measure and the probability of taking a postdoctoral position. Both the cohort and current fund revenue results are consistent with the hypothesis that young scientists and engineers seek postdoctoral positions in reaction to unfavorable job prospects in the traditional (academic) sector. For the more abbreviated period, 1981-1995, we also examine the joint impact of the supply and demand variables at the field level. The cohort results for this joint model are fairly comparable to those reported in Table 5 for all postdocs; there are fewer instances where the cohort variable is significant in the academic postdoc equations. The demand variable is significant with the expected sign in the fields of earth science and oceanography and agriculture for both the postdoc and academic postdoc equations. We also examine the impact that changes in the NIH budget have had on the probability of taking a postdoc position for the period 1981-1999 for PhDs in biology. We measure changes both in constant and current dollars. 12 We find the probability of taking a postdoctoral position to be negatively and significantly (at the 1 percent level) related to the percentage change in current dollars. We find the relationship to be insignificant when percentage change is measured in constant dollars. The counterintuitive result for current dollars may reflect changes occurring at the end of the 1990s when the postdoc frenzy had begun to decline as individuals began to choose alternative career paths, and is consistent with our findings that the odds of taking a postdoc dipped in the years after 1995. When we restrict the period to 1981-1995, we find the probability of taking a postdoc to be positively and significantly (at the 1 percent level) related to the percentage change in the NIH budget, as measured in constant dollars. We find the coefficient on percentage change in current dollars to be insignificant. By way of summary, our results clearly suggest that several factors contributed to the dramatic increase in postdoctoral positions that occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They include (1) the increasing proportion of temporary residents in the graduate population; (2) the increasing proportion of degrees being awarded in biology; 3 "}, {"section_title": "The duration of postdoctoral experience", "text": "As we mentioned earlier, in addition to more PhDs taking a postdoc position, the length of individuals' postdoc experience has also increased over the years. In this section, we first document the trends in the length of individuals' postdoc experience. We then estimate a model to examine various factors that contribute to these trends. The data used in this section are drawn from the Survey of Doctorate Recipients   As with Section 3, we focus on ten broad field categories. The postdocs in these ten fields represent over 80 percent of all postdocs in the sample. Of these fields, biology postdocs make up more than half (55.7 percent) of all postdocs, followed by chemistry (12.0 percent), engineering (9.7 percent) and physics (8.5 percent). Table 6 provides the summary statistics of these explanatory variables for the postdoc sample as well as for the full sample. Table 6 shows that, compared to the full sample, individuals in the postdoc sample received their first PhD degree about a year earlier than those in the full sample. A much higher proportion of the postdoc sample is in biology (55.7 percent) than in the full sample (33.8 percent). In addition, a slightly higher proportion of the postdoc sample consists of temporary visa holders. These statistics are consistent with what we found in the propensity model in Section 3. Table 6 also shows that in the postdoc sample, 67. those who receive pension benefits stay on a postdoc position 9.3 more months than those who do not have pension benefits. Those who receive health insurance stay on 2.7 more months than those who do not receive health insurance. The results also show that most PhD year dummy variables (1979 to 1990) are positive and statistically significant (the benchmark is 1975). This suggests that the length of postdoc experience has been rising during the period between 1979 and 1990. The 1995 SDR postdoc module includes questions on the reasons for taking the postdoc positions. One in eight respondents state that they took the most recent postdoc because other jobs were not available. Although this is clearly a highly subjective measure of labor market conditions, in the absence of other measures we include it in the analysis. We find that those who report \"bad jobs\" as the reason for having taken the most recent postdoc position hold the position 2.7 months longer than those who do not report this as the reason. We also estimate a duration model of postdoc length. 13 The duration model allows us to include all postdocs in the analysis while taking into account the fact that some individuals were still on a postdoc position at the time of the 1995 survey (rightcensored). In the duration model, the dependent variable is the log of the postdoc length. Results are reported in Columns 1 and 2 in Table 8. To put these results in perspective, we also estimate our OLS model using the log of postdoc length as the dependent variable for the time period 1975-1990 and report the results in Columns 3 and 4. These results show that estimates from the duration model are very similar to those from the OLS model, further confirming that our OLS results are robust."}, {"section_title": "Concluding remarks", "text": "US research universities have become increasingly populated by postdoctoral fellows. During the 1990s, for example, the proportion of PhDs on US campuses who were postdocs increased by over 16 percent. This increase is a mixed blessing for research universities. On the one hand, postdocs receive training and contribute to the research productivity of the university. On the other hand, the growing number of postdocs on campuses, coupled with their poor job prospects, has led to considerable dissatisfaction among postdocs. This in turn creates morale problems for laboratories. It can also have negative spillover effects for undergraduates pondering a career in science or engineering. Here we have examined factors contributing to this increase, paying particular attention to the propensity of individuals to take a postdoc and the amount of time individuals spend in postdoc positions. We find that the increased propensity to take a postdoctoral position can be attributed to a change in the mix of doctoral students, particularly to the increased proportion of PhDs being awarded in the life sciences and the increased proportion of temporary residents in the graduate population. The increased propensity to take a postdoc position also relates to adverse job market conditions experienced by PhDs during the period. We find that increased duration can be explained by some of the same factors. These include the increasing proportion of temporary residents in the graduate population and the increased number of degrees being awarded in the life sciences. Adverse job market conditions also appear to play a role, although we have a subjective measure of the state of the market. We also find the duration of the postdoc experience to be positively related to the provision of pension and health benefits. In recent years, as the proportion of the campus community that are postdocs has grown, university administrators have begun to address many of the complex issues related to postdocs. These include length of tenure in position, pay and fringe benefits. It is now becoming somewhat common, for example, for universities to limit tenure in a postdoctoral position to five years, and many universities now provide the fringe benefits that historically were not provided to postdocs. These are fixes that can be made at the university level. The major issue of job market prospects, however, is outside the scope of the local university. Our work suggests that during the late 1990s, when the economy heated up, the propensity to take a postdoc declined. Universities have little direct impact on short-term economic growth. But, they do have the ability to influence the way in which national research funds are distributed and committed. One possible \"fix\" to the postdoc situation is to use federal funds increasingly to support career positions of research scientists. Gerbi and Garrison (2004) recommend that universities \"look beyond the current scheme of graduate students and postdoctorals to staff the academic research laboratory,\" recognizing the importance of the research scientist's position and rewarding research scientists with salaries that make the position an \"honorable career.\"   Model 1975-1990PhD Cohorts 1975-1990  053 For the duration model, the total number of observations is 5006 (4698 non-censored). For the OLS model, the number of observation is 5008. "}]
