[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective, and Bipolar disorders share behavioral and phenomenological traits, intermediate phenotypes, and some associated genetic loci with pleiotropic effects. Volumetric abnormalities in brain structures are among the intermediate phenotypes consistently reported associated with these disorders. In order to examine the genetic underpinnings of these structural brain modifications, we performed genome-wide association analyses (GWAS) on 60 quantitative structural brain MRI phenotypes in a sample of 777 subjects (483 cases and 294 controls pooled together). Genotyping was performed with the Illumina PsychChip microarray, followed by imputation to the 1000 genomes multiethnic reference panel. Enlargement of the Temporal Horns of Lateral Ventricles (THLV) is associated with an intronic SNP of the gene NRXN1 (rs12467877, P = 6.76E-10), which accounts for 4.5% of the variance in size. Enlarged THLV is associated with psychosis in this sample, and with reduction of the hippocampus and enlargement of the choroid plexus and caudate. Eight other suggestively significant associations (P < 5.5E-8) were identified with THLV and 5 other brain structures. Although rare deletions of NRXN1 have been previously associated with psychosis, this is the first report of a common SNP variant of NRXN1 associated with enlargement of the THLV in psychosis."}, {"section_title": "Translational Psychiatry", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A R T I C L E", "text": "O p e n A c c e s s NRXN1 is associated with enlargement of the temporal horns of the lateral ventricles in psychosis "}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "There is ample evidence of partially overlapping brain morphology abnormalities in schizophrenia (SZ), schizoaffective disorder (SAD), and bipolar disorder (BD) [1] [2] [3] . These disorders also have a shared set of genetic loci associated with them which can generate diverse disease phenotypes (pleiotropism), and a partially shared polygenic diathesis 4, 5 , as well as shared behavioral features, including psychosis in some BD patients. Although large samples of patients with psychotic mental disorders and controls have undergone GWAS, the phenotypes in these studies have been mostly restricted to diagnostic categories 4, 6 , and most studies of intermediate phenotypes associated with psychosis reported are based on smaller samples [7] [8] [9] [10] . Gottesman proposed the term endophenotype for sub-phenotypes observable in patients that might prove more tractable to genetic analysis 11, 12 , and independently Gershon et al. 13, 14 proposed a similar idea. Following these concepts, the Bipolar and Schizophrenia Network for Intermediate Phenotypes study (B-SNIP) collected multiple phenotypes on each studied individual, aimed to identify biomarkers of psychosis and their genetic correlations, which can help elucidate mechanisms of the disorders, and lead to improved classifications and personalized treatment 15 . Previous neuroimaging studies found enlargement of the ventricular system in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia 16, 17 , and the temporal (inferior) horns of the lateral ventricles (THLV) were also reported enlarged in patients with these disorders 18 . Here we present genome-wide association analyses of brain imaging in 777 B-SNIP patients with psychosis and healthy controls. Although this sample size is smaller than current large case-control studies, the power to detect associations using quantitative phenotypes is higher than with dichotomous traits, and pooling ill subjects with normal controls to analyze quantitative traits has the advantage of a wider range in the observed phenotypes, which translates into higher power to detect genetic associations 19 . As noted by Dahl et al."}, {"section_title": "20", "text": ", deep phenotyping with simultaneous genome-wide analyses can serve as a discovery tool for previously unsuspected relationships of phenotypic traits with each other, and with shared molecular events. In this study we found a significant association between the THLV volume and a common intronic SNP of the gene Neurexin 1 (NRXN1). NRXN1 is known to be involved in brain development and function. These facts support the potential role of this common variant of NRXN1 in psychosis."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "The Bipolar and Schizophrenia Network for Intermediate Phenotypes (B-SNIP) studies individuals with schizophrenia (SZ), schizoaffective disorder (SAD), bipolar disorder with psychosis (BD), and healthy controls. Data were collected between 2008 and 2012 at six study sites in the USA, with IRB approval at each participating institution. Details of phenotype collection are described in Tamminga el al. 21, 22 , including standardization of phenotyping methods across all the collaborating sites. Here we present genome-wide association analyses of structural brain MRI data from 59 brain volumes plus the whole brain gray matter density, studied in 483 cases (169 BD, 127 SAD, and 187 SZ) and 294 healthy controls. Sample demographics are shown in Table 1 . A total of 60 quantitative traits (listed in Supplementary Material) from these 777 cases and controls pooled together are analyzed here as phenotypes in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Diagnostic categories were not used as phenotypes or as covariates in GWAS, except for post-hoc analyses to check on phenotypic associations with case-control status in this dataset, and whether our top SNP was associated with disease. The rationale to pool cases and controls is that in the study of quantitative traits when the phenotype is associated with disease there will be greater phenotypic variation and thus more power to detect association. These associations could help to explain part of the shared pathophysiology of these disorders. Including each diagnostic category as a covariate would ignore the genetic intercorrelation of the diagnoses, and detract from estimates of genetic associations with the tested phenotypes."}, {"section_title": "Phenotypes: Image processing", "text": "Structural T1-weighted 3D magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) scans were acquired at six sites: Boston (3.0 T, GE Signa), Detroit (3.0 T, Siemens Allegra), Baltimore (3.0 T, Siemens Trio trim), Hartford (3.0 T, Siemens Allegra), Dallas (3.0 T, Philips) and Chicago (3.0 T, GE Signa).

The scans went through first-level auto-reconstruction to undergo registration in standard space, motion correction and skull striping. Trained raters edited the images to remove dura, sinuses and blood vessels that could interfere with segmentation. Scans were run through second and third level auto-reconstruction to segment gray-white matter, reviewed by two independent raters and removed if motion interfered with segmentation.

Enlargement of THLV was correlated in our sample with volume reduction of the hippocampus and with enlargement of the choroid plexus and caudate (Table 3) ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Enlarged ventricular volumes have been among the most consistent anatomical alterations found in SZ and BD, first reported by Johnstone in schizophrenia more than forty years ago 47 . This has been confirmed in SZ and BD patients compared with healthy controls in large studies by the ENIGMA consortium, and the heritability of the volume of lateral ventricles was calculated to be 0.54 by Kremen et al. 48 . The temporal horn of the lateral ventricle traverses the temporal lobe in a lateral-anterior direction, bordering the caudate, putamen, amygdala, choroid plexus, and hippocampus. Increased ventricular volumes observed in schizophrenia have been attributed to volume reduction of surrounding gray matter structures 49, 50 , which is confirmed in this study. Enlargement of choroid plexus in this sample was also associated with cognitive and structural connectivity problems in cases, published by Lizano et al. 51 . The UK Biobank has published structural MRI GWAS results that contain SNP associations with the temporal horn 52 , which did not replicate our significant finding (UK biobank result for rs12467877 P = 0.095). Non-replication of our finding in the UK Biobank sample may be due to a negligible proportion of psychotic patients in their dataset. GWAS analysis of THLV in our controls (only) also gave a non-significant association for rs12467877 (P = 0.07).

This gene is highly intolerant to loss of function mutations, as described by the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC), with a probability of Loss of function Intolerance, pLI = 1 (https://decipher.sanger.ac.uk/genes). Structural copy number variants (CNVs) disrupting NRXN1 are associated with a wide spectrum of brain disorders including schizophrenia, autism, and developmental disorders [55] [56] [57] . The UK Brain Expression Consortium (http://www. braineac.org/) 41 has reported expression data for NRXN1 related to rs12467877, with no significant evidence for affecting expression (see Suppl. Material, page 10). The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project (http://gtexportal.org) also does not report functional associations for rs12467877. Functional analyses using FUMA identified this and other suggestively associated SNPs to be related to the expression of other genes, such as PPP1R21 and GSG1L (Suppl. Material), which are highly expressed in brain during development and adulthood.\nThree other genes suggestively associated with THLV are SPATA16, MAP9 and GSG1L. SPATA16 is involved in spermatogenesis and structural variants of this gene have been associated with globozoospermia 58 . MAP9 (also known as ASAP) is a gene encoding a microtubule associated protein highly expressed in brain and thyroid (https://gtexportal.org) 59 . The germ cell-specific gene 1-like protein (GSG1L) is a component of the AMPA receptor complex, a glutamate transmembrane receptor in the CNS, highly expressed in nucleus accumbens and basal ganglia, that has been associated with synaptic plasticity, mathematical ability, and creative activities in music [60] [61] [62] . Functional analysis of the GSG1L suggestively associated SNPs identified additional eQTLs (See Supplementary Material). This is the first report of a common SNP variant of NRXN1 associated with enlargement of THLV volume in psychosis, and this volume is correlated with reduction of the hippocampus and enlargement of the caudate and choroid plexus. The association p-value 6.76E-10 is significant after multiple test correction, but further research with a larger sample of cases and controls will be needed to confirm these results. Although the role of this common NRXN1 SNP in psychosis is indirect, this study adds evidence to the role of NRXN1 in psychosis, which was originally implied by rare CNVs of this gene."}]
