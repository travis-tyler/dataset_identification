[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "IMPORTANCE Accumulating data suggest that elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurofilament light (NfL) and neurogranin (Ng) levels are associated with cognitive decline and may be useful markers of neurodegeneration. However, to our knowledge, previous studies have not assessed these CSF markers in the community, evaluated them with regards to risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or compared their prognostic value with CSF total tau (T-tau) or phosphorylated tau (P-tau).\nOBJECTIVE To determine (1) whether CSF NfL and Ng levels were associated with risk of MCI, (2) the effect size of these markers compared with CSF T-tau or P-tau for risk of MCI, and (3) whether CSF amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b242) modified these associations.\nThe analyses included 648 participants without cognitive impairment who were enrolled into the prospective population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging between January 2004 and December 2015 with available CSF data and at least 1 follow-up visit. Participants were followed up for a median of 3.8 years (interquartile range, 2.6-5.4 years). The CSF NfL and Ng levels were measured using an in-house sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The CSF A\u03b242, T-tau, and P-tau levels were measured with automated electrochemiluminescence immunoassays. Cox proportional hazards models, with age as the timescale, were used to assess the association between CSF NfL, Ng, A\u03b242, T-tau, or P-tau with risk of MCI after adjusting for sex, education, apolipoprotein E genotype, and the Charlson comorbidity index. To examine CSF A\u03b242 as an effect modifier, it was categorized into tertiles; the bottom tertile was defined as having elevated brain amyloid.\nRESULTS At baseline, the median age of the 648 participants without cognitive impairment was 72.3 years (range, 50.7-95.3 years) and 366 (56.5%) were men; 96 (14.8%) developed incident MCI. Compared with the bottom quartile, the top quartile of CSF NfL was associated with a 3.1-fold increased risk of MCI (hazard ratio, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.36-7.18) in multivariate models. Neither CSF T-tau, P-tau, nor Ng was associated with risk of MCI. There was no interaction between A\u03b242 and CSF NfL for risk of MCI.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Elevated CSF NfL levels but not CSF T-tau, P-tau or Ng are a risk factor for MCI in a community population and are independent of brain amyloid."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "A lzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and tau pathologies, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline. 1 Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)\nA\u03b242, total tau (T-tau), and phosphorylated tau (P-tau) are established diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers for AD. 2 More recently, 2 promising biomarkers for neurodegeneration, neurofilament light protein (NfL) and neurogranin (Ng), have emerged. 3 Neurofilament light protein functions to determine the axonal caliber, which is crucial for morphological integrity and conduction velocity. 4, 5 Therefore, NfL is a putative marker of subcortical large-caliber axonal degeneration and has recently been highlighted for its potential as a biomarker of AD progression. 6 In contrast, Ng is a postsynaptic protein that is enriched in dendritic spines and therefore could be a potential biomarker for detecting synaptic dysfunction and/or loss in AD. 7 Recent studies have reported that elevated CSF NfL 8, 9 and/or Ng [8] [9] [10] levels are associated with a greater risk of progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD dementia or with cognitive decline.

We used Cox proportional hazard regression models to determine whether the baseline CSF markers, continuous and in quartiles, were associated with risk of MCI among CU participants. Age was used as the timescale. Participants were followed up until a diagnosis of MCI/dementia, death, or last follow-up visit. The event date for those who developed MCI or dementia was defined as the midpoint between a participant's last visit defined as CU and first visit defined as MCI or dementia. Four participants went from a diagnosis of CU at one visit to a diagnosis of dementia at a subsequent visit. The analyses were repeated including and excluding these participants and the results remained the same. Thus, they were included in the final models.

To determine whether a combination of elevated CSF NfL and T-tau levels was more strongly associated with MCI risk compared with either alone, we developed a categorical variable with NfL only in the highest quartile, T-tau only in the highest quartile, NfL and T-tau in the highest quartile, and neither NfL nor T-tau in the highest quartile. We then used Cox proportional hazard models to assess the association between this variable and MCI risk. We also examined whether there was an interaction between CSF A\u03b242 and CSF NfL or Ng for risk of MCI.

Elevated CSF NfL levels were strongly associated with risk of MCI. There were no associations between CSF Ng, T-tau, or P-tau and risk of MCI. The combination of elevated CSF NfL and T-tau levels for risk of MCI was not better than CSF NfL alone. As expected, low CSF A\u03b242 levels were associated with an increased risk of MCI. However, the associations between CSF NfL and risk for MCI were independent of CSF A\u03b242. Collectively, these results suggest that in a community-based sample of CU participants, CSF NfL is more strongly associated with risk of MCI compared with other CSF markers of neurodegeneration (eg, T-tau and Ng). Two previous studies that used ADNI data reported that elevated CSF NfL levels were associated with a faster cognitive decline among patients with MCI. 6, 8 Another study based on the Swedish Dementia Registry showed that higher CSF NfL levels were associated with a shorter survival among patients with AD dementia, 24 again suggesting that CSF NfL is a marker of clinical progression in symptomatic patients. Our results extend this finding earlier in the clinical disease spectrum by showing that high CSF NfL levels are also strongly associated with risk of MCI in a community-based study of CU participants. Our findings are also consistent with ADNI results suggesting that CSF NfL was associated with cortical and subcortical brain atrophy, 6,9 which should translate into cognitive progression. Low CSF A\u03b242 levels were associated with risk for MCI, which has been shown before in participants with preclinical AD stage 1 National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer Association criteria.\n25, 26 The association between elevated CSF NfL levels and MCI was independent of CSF A\u03b242. Thus, CSF NfL is a risk factor for cognitive impairment for those on the AD pathway (with low CSF A\u03b242 levels) and for those who are not. Our results are also consistent with studies that have shown that elevated CSF NfL levels reflect neurodegeneration in AD 6, 9, 24 and in many other neurological diseases. 24 Thus, CSF NfL is a nonspecific marker of neurodegeneration.\nWhen we compared elevated CSF NfL levels with T-tau and P-tau, NfL was associated with risk of MCI whereas CSF T-tau and P-tau were not. In addition, CSF NfL was the best fit model. In fact, there were no associations between T-tau or P-tau and risk of MCI, a finding that contradicts previous studies. 26, 27 A potential explanation for the lack of an association could be the population-based study design in contrast to including CU clinical patients or at-risk populations because of a significant family history. Further, the combination of elevated CSF T-tau and NfL levels was not better than NfL alone for predicting risk of MCI. These findings suggest that CSF NfL is a stronger predictor of cognitive deterioration than T-tau in a population-based sample of CU participants. In addition, our results support the hypothesis that CSF NfL and CSF T-tau convey divergent information regarding neurodegeneration. Cerebrospinal fluid NfL is a measure of axonal injury, whereas CSF T-tau probably reflects the temporal course and severity of neuronal injury at a given point."}, {"section_title": "28-30", "text": "We did not find any associations between CSF Ng and risk for MCI. This parallels findings from the memory clinicbased Amsterdam Dementia Cohort, in which Ng did not predict progression from CU to MCI but did predict progression from MCI to AD dementia. 10 Another recent study conducted in ADNI showed that elevated Ng levels were associated with cognitive decline in participants with MCI but not among CU participants. 31 These findings, together with our finding that CSF Ng was not associated with risk for MCI, suggest that CSF Ng levels may be elevated later in the disease process after cognitive symptoms become apparent. Notably, we found a strong correlation between CSF Ng and T-tau and P-tau, which has been described previously. 8 This strong correlation may explain the lack of association between CSF Ng and risk for MCI because we also found that CSF T-tau and P-Tau were not associated with risk of MCI."}, {"section_title": "Strengths and Limitations", "text": "The strengths of this study include the community-based population and the large number of CU participants. However, there are some limitations. First, we could not differentiate between cognitive subtypes of MCI because the subgroups were quite small. Second, all CSF markers were measured at 1 point. Thus, we could not incorporate time-varying measures and the association between intraindividual change in these markers and cognition could not be assessed. Third, when examining CSF A\u03b242 as an effect modifier, we considered the lowest tertile as indicative of elevated brain amyloid levels. It is possible that the subtle effects of emerging A\u03b2 pathology in participants with slightly higher CSF A\u03b242 levels (ie, in the second tertile) have been overlooked."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Taken together, our findings suggest that CSF NfL is a valuable biomarker of early neurodegeneration but not specific for AD pathobiology.
