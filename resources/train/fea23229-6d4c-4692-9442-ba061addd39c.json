[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "T HERE is a decrease in maximal urine concentrating ability during normal aging in humans ( 1 -3 ). This physiological response to aging was clearly demonstrated in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging ( 1 ). Rowe and colleagues measured maximal urine concentrating ability in healthy individuals in three age groups: 20 -39, 40 -59, and 60 -79 years . When compared with the two younger age groups, individuals aged 60 -79 years had approximately a 20% reduction in maximal urine osmolality, a 50% decrease in the ability to conserve solute, and a 100% increase in minimal urine fl ow rate ( 1 ). Aged individuals do have a diminished thirst response, but the relationship between vasopressin (also named antidiuretic hormone) secretion and plasma osmolality is preserved and may even be enhanced ( 3 ). The change in urine concentrating ability could not be explained by a decrease in glomerular fi ltration rate ( 1 ). Thus, neither an abnormality in vasopressin secretion nor a reduction in renal function (as measured by glomerular fi ltration rate) appears to be the mechanism that explains the decrease in urine concentrating ability during aging in people or Wag/Rij rats ( 1 , 3 , 4 ).\nA challenge in the fi eld is distinguishing between normal aging and superimposed pathologies. Kidney function deteriorates at very different rates with aging in humans ( 1 ). In rats, there are strain (rather than environment) dependent changes with the F344/BN and Wag/Rij rats showing minimal, F344 showing moderate, and Sprague Dawley showing marked age-dependent loss of GFR and structural damage. These strain differences make it diffi cult to know which animal model best mimics human aging.\nThe cloning of many of the key kidney medullary water channel (aquaporins) and solute (sodium and urea) transmechanism, and the type 2 vasopressin receptor, have resulted in studies into the molecular mechanisms underlying the reduction in urine concentrating ability that occurs during aging (reviewed in [ 5 -7 ]). Understanding the agingrelated changes that occur in vasopressin levels, adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) production, and the abundances of the key transport proteins involved in urine concentration may also be relevant to understanding the pathophysiology of nocturnal polyuria ( 8 -10 ).\nThe region of the kidney that is responsible for the generation of concentrated or dilute urine is the medulla ( Figure 1 ). To produce concentrated urine, a hypertonic medullary interstitium must be generated by the nephron segments located in the loops of Henle , and the collecting duct must be permeable to water (reviewed in [ 11 ] ). To generate a hypertonic medullary interstitium, a small osmotic gradient is generated at each level of the medulla and then magnifi ed down its length by countercurrent multiplication. In the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (in the outer medulla) , the NKCC2/BSC1 cotransporter actively reabsorbs Na + , K + , and Cl \u2212 across the apical membrane , the K + that is reabsorbed is secreted back into the lumen via the K + secretory channel ROMK , resulting in net NaCl reabsorption.\nIn contrast to the outer medulla, NaCl is passively reabsorbed in the inner medulla across the thin ascending limb of the loop of Henle (reviewed in [ 11 ] Urine concentrating ability is reduced during normal aging in people and rats. The abundance of many of the key transport proteins that contribute to urine concentrating ability is reduced in the kidney medulla of aged rats.

NaCl reabsorption exceeds urea secretion in the thin ascending limb as it has a higher permeability to NaCl than urea, thereby resulting in dilution of the thin ascending limb luminal fl uid as it ascends toward the outer medulla.\nNaCl reabsorption in both ascending limb portions of the loop of Henle results in both a hypertonic medullary interstitium and delivery of a dilute fl uid (relative to plasma) to the distal tubule because both ascending limb segments are water impermeable. In the absence of vasopressin, the collecting duct is impermeable to water resulting in excretion of this dilute fl uid as dilute urine. However, in the presence of vasopressin, the collecting duct becomes highly permeable to water, and if a hypertonic medulla is present, water is reabsorbed resulting in excretion of a concentrated urine (reviewed in [ 11 ] ).\nThe region of the kidney that is responsible for the generation of concentrated or dilute urine is the medulla ( Figure 1 ).

The decrease in vasopressin-dependent cAMP production could contribute to the reduced urine concentrating ability in aging. However, inner medullary cAMP content is similar in 10 -and 30 -month -old Wag/ Rij rats, both under control conditions and following 2 days of water deprivation ( 22 ) . The lack of change in inner medullary cAMP content was surprising as plasma vasopressin was signifi cantly higher in both the 10 -and 30 -month -old water deprived Wag/Rij rats ( 22 ) .

The V 1 receptor is involved in increasing systemic blood pressure and has two subtypes: V 1a and V 1b (also called The primary mechanism by which vasopressin rapidly regulates water reabsorption in the collecting duct is by regulating the accumulation of AQP2 in the apical plasma membrane (reviewed in [ 11 , 15 , 16 , 23 ] ). Vasopressin regulation involves both AQP2 phosphorylation at serines 256, 261, 264, and 269 ( 24 -27 ) and regulated traffi cking of AQP2 between subapical vesicles and the apical plasma membrane (reviewed in [ 5 , 23 ] ). Wade and colleagues ( 28 ) originally proposed the \" membrane shuttle hypothesis \" in 1979, at a time when water channels had not been cloned or identifi ed. They proposed that the (putative) water channels were stored in subapical vesicles and inserted into the apical plasma membrane in response to vasopressin. After AQP2 was cloned, the \" membrane shuttle hypothesis \" was confi rmed experimentally by Knepper and colleagues ( 7 ) in rat inner medullary collecting ducts (reviewed in [ 5 , 23 ] ). The water that is reabsorbed through AQP2 exits the collecting duct principal cells through AQP3 and AQP4. When vasopressin stimulation ends, water reabsorption is stopped by endocytosing AQP2 back into the cell, where it is recycled into endosomes until the next stimulation by vasopressin (reviewed in [ 11 , 15 , 16 ] ).\nElderly individuals are often prescribed medications that can interfere with vasopressin release, vasopressin function, or affect the regulation of aquaporins (reviewed in [ 29 ] ). This can result in an increased incidence of either hyponatremia or hypernatreia in elderly individuals. The reader is referred to a recent review for a detailed discussion of this topic ( 29 ) .\nSeveral studies show that the abundance of some of the aquaporin proteins is reduced in the aged Wag/Rij rat kidney ( 18 , 22 , 30 ) , which could contribute to the reduction in concentrating ability during aging. These studies show that AQP2 protein abundance is reduced in 24 -to 30 -monthold rats (which are very old rats), when compared with 10 -month-old rats, in both the inner and outer medulla, in both Wag/Rij and F344/BN rats ( 17 , 18 , 22 , 30 ) . The abundance of AQP2 that is phosphorylated at serine 256 is also markedly reduced in the older Wag/Rij rats ( 22 , 30 ) ; phosphorylation of serines 261, 264, and 269 has not been studied to date. AQP3 protein abundance is also reduced in the inner medulla of 30 -month-old rats, compared with 10 -month-old rats, but not in the outer medulla ( 18 , 30 ) . Transepithelial water reabsorption across the collecting duct of aged rats is likely to be reduced by the reductions in AQP2 and AQP3 protein abundances. These changes appear to be specifi c for AQP2 and AQP3 because neither AQP4 nor AQP1 protein abundances differ between 10 -and 30 -monthold Wag/Rij and Sprague Dawley rats ( 18 , 29 , 31 ) . This is consistent with AQP1 and AQP4 being constitutively expressed, whereas AQP2 and AQP3 gene expression is regulated by vasopressin.\nThe preceding studies pertain to rats receiving food and water ad libitum, that is euvolemic rats. Because elderly individuals are more susceptible to dehydration than younger ones, an important clinical issue is the response of aged people to dehydration. To model this situation in rats, we compared the ability of 30 -month-old rats to respond to 3 days of water restriction, as compared with the response of 4 -month-old F344/BNF1 rats ( 32 ); 4 -month-old rats are young adult animals ( Figure 2 ). Both the 4 -and 30 -month-old F344/BNF1 rats lost 8% of their body weight and had similar increases in hematocrit, but only the older rats became signifi cantly hypernatremic (serum sodium > 160 mEq/ L ) ( 32 ) . Urine osmolality and AQP2 protein abundance increased signifi cantly in the 4 -month-old rats but not in the 30 -month-old F344/BN F1 and Sprague Dawley rats ( 17 , 32 , 33 ) . Somewhat surprisingly, AQP2 protein abundance did not increase in dehydrated 15 -month-old F344/ BNF1 rats, similar to the response in the 30 -month-old rats ( 33 ) . AQP2 mRNA abundance also increased in dehydrated 2 -month-old rats but not in dehydrated 7 -month-old Sprague Dawley rats ( 19 ) . Thus, the age at which concentrating ability is lost in rats may be signifi cantly younger than 24 -30 months and emphasizes the need to study animals at several ages in order to understand the physiology of aging.\nIn contrast to the preceding fi ndings, another study using a different strain of rats found that 2 days of water deprivation signifi cantly increased total AQP2 and phosphoserine 256-AQP2 protein abundances in both 10 -and 30 -monthold Wag/Rij rats ( 22 ) . In this study, AQP2 mRNA abundance was increased in the outer medulla of the 30 -month-old rats, compared with the 10 -month -old rats, but was unchanged in the inner medulla ( 22 ) . This study concluded that AQP2 is downregulated by a posttranscriptional mechanism in aging, but water deprivation eliminates this downregulation ( 22 ) . The different fi ndings in studies that employ rats of different ages and/or strains makes it diffi cult to extrapolate these fi ndings to humans. Nitric at ( 21 ) .

After AQP2 was cloned, the \" membrane shuttle hypothesis \" was confi rmed experimentally by Knepper and colleagues ( 7 ) in rat inner medullary collecting ducts (reviewed in [ 5 , 23 ] ). The water that is reabsorbed through AQP2 exits the collecting duct principal cells through AQP3 and AQP4. When vasopressin stimulation ends, water reabsorption is stopped by endocytosing AQP2 back into the cell, where it is recycled into endosomes until the next stimulation by vasopressin (reviewed in [ 11 , 15 , 16 ] ).\nElderly individuals are often prescribed medications that can interfere with vasopressin release, vasopressin function, or affect the regulation of aquaporins (reviewed in [ 29 ] ). This can result in an increased incidence of either hyponatremia or hypernatreia in elderly individuals. The reader is referred to a recent review for a detailed discussion of this topic ( 29 ) .\nSeveral studies show that the abundance of some of the aquaporin proteins is reduced in the aged Wag/Rij rat kidney ( 18 , 22 , 30 ) , which could contribute to the reduction in con-10 -month-old rats, in both the inner and outer medulla, in both Wag/Rij and F344/BN rats ( 17 , 18 , 22 , 30 ) . The abundance of AQP2 that is phosphorylated at serine 256 is also markedly reduced in the older Wag/Rij rats ( 22 , 30 ) ; phosphorylation of serines 261, 264, and 269 has not been studied to date. AQP3 protein abundance is also reduced in the inner medulla of 30 -month-old rats, compared with 10 -month-old rats, but not in the outer medulla ( 18 , 30 ) . Transepithelial water reabsorption across the collecting duct of aged rats is likely to be reduced by the reductions in AQP2 and AQP3 protein abundances. These changes appear to be specifi c for AQP2 and AQP3 because neither AQP4 nor AQP1 protein abundances differ between 10 -and 30 -monthold Wag/Rij and Sprague Dawley rats ( 18 , 29 , 31 ) . This is consistent with AQP1 and AQP4 being constitutively expressed, whereas AQP2 and AQP3 gene expression is regulated by vasopressin.\nThe preceding studies pertain to rats receiving food and water ad libitum, that is euvolemic rats. Because elderly individuals are more susceptible to dehydration than younger ones, an important clinical issue is the response of aged people to dehydration. To model this situation in rats, we compared the ability of 30 -month-old rats to respond to 3 days of water restriction, as compared with the response of 4 -month-old F344/BNF1 rats ( 32 ); 4 -month-old rats are young adult animals ( Figure 2 ). Both the 4 -and 30 -month-old F344/BNF1 rats lost 8% of their body weight and had similar increases in hematocrit, but only the older rats became signifi cantly hypernatremic (serum sodium > 160 mEq/ L ) ( 32 ) . Urine osmolality and AQP2 protein abundance increased signifi cantly in the 4 -month-old rats but not in the 30 -month-old F344/BN F1 and Sprague Dawley rats ( 17 , 32 , 33 ) . Somewhat surprisingly, AQP2 protein abundance did not increase in dehydrated 15 -month-old F344/ BNF1 rats, similar to the response in the 30 -month-old rats ( 33 ) . AQP2 mRNA abundance also increased in dehydrated 2 -month-old rats but not in dehydrated 7 -month-old Sprague Dawley rats ( 19 ) . Thus, the age at which concentrating ability is lost in rats may be signifi cantly younger than 24 -30 months and emphasizes the need to study animals at several ages in order to understand the physiology of aging.\nIn contrast to the preceding fi ndings, another study using a different strain of rats found that 2 days of water deprivation signifi cantly increased total AQP2 and phosphoserine 256-AQP2 protein abundances in both 10 -and 30 -monthold Wag/Rij rats ( 22 ) . In this study, AQP2 mRNA abundance was increased in the outer medulla of the 30 -month-old rats, compared with the 10 -month -old rats, but was unchanged in the inner medulla ( 22 ) .

The reduced levels of UT-A1 and UT-A3 proteins will decrease urea reabsorption and inner medullary interstitial urea accumulation, thereby reducing the hyperosmolality of the inner medulla and urine concentrating ability. Thus, reductions in UT-A1 and UT-A3 protein abundances, along with reductions in water channel and sodium transporter protein abundances (discussed earlier ), likely contribute to the reduced urine concentrating ability in the aged rats. Changes in glucocorticoid levels may be a mechanism that contributes to the decrease in UT-A1 abundance in aged rats. Older ( 30-month-old) rats have elevated plasma corticosterone levels as compared with 10 -month-old Wag/Rij rats ( 35 ) . Glucocorticoids decrease UT-A1 transcription, mRNA abundance, and protein abundance ( 50 , 51 ) . These fi ndings suggest the possibility that increased glucocorticoid levels in aged rats may contribute to the reduction in UT-A1 protein, but this has not been tested experimentally.\nUT-B protein is expressed in the descending vasa recta and on erythrocytes. A reduction in UT-B would reduce urine concentrating ability by decreasing intrarenal urea recycling and/or reducing the effi ciency of countercurrent exchange. People who lack the Kidd blood group antigen, which is also UT-B, and knockout mice lacking UT-B are unable to concentrate their urine to normal levels ( 52 , 53 ) . Thus, UT-B protein expression in the descending vasa recta and/or on erythrocytes is necessary to produce maximally concentrated urine ( 52 , 54 -56 ) .\nUT-B protein abundance is signifi cantly reduced in aged Wag/Rij rats ( 30 , 49 ) , and administration of supraphysiological amounts of dDAVP increases it ( 35 ). Thus, the reduced level of UT-B protein is another factor that may contribute to reduced urine concentrating ability in aged rats and possibly humans."}, {"section_title": "SANDS 4", "text": "oxide synthase activity decreases AQP2 protein abundance and apical plasma membrane traffi cking in the inner medullary collecting duct in response to hemorrhage in Sprague Dawley rats ( 34 ) .

Many of the key proteins that contribute to urine concentrating ability, specifi cally the V 2 receptor, AQP2, serine 256-phosphorylated AQP2, AQP3, NKCC2/BSC1, UT-A1, and UT-B, are reduced in the kidney medulla of aged rats. The reductions in the abundances of these proteins, and their reduced response to water restriction or administration of a supraphysiologic dose of dDAVP, may contribute to the reduced ability of aged rats to concentrate their urine and conserve water. If similar mechanisms occur in human kidneys, it would provide a molecular explanation for the reduced concentrating ability in aging and may provide opportunities for novel therapeutic approaches to improve urine concentrating ability and/or nocturnal polyuria."}, {"section_title": "F unding", "text": "This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grants R01-DK41707 , R01-DK89828 , and R21-DK91147 ."}]
