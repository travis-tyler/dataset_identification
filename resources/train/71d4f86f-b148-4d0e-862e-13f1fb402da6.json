[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: A disease severity index (SI) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been proposed that summarizes MRIderived structural measures into a single score using multivariate data analysis. Objectives: To longitudinally evaluate the use of the SI to monitor disease progression and predict future progression to AD in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Further, to investigate the association between longitudinal change in the SI and cognitive impairment, Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype as well as the levels of cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta 1-42 (A\u03b2) peptide. Methods: The dataset included 195 AD, 145 MCI and 228 control subjects with annual follow-up for three years, where 70 MCI subjects progressed to AD (MCI-p). For each subject the SI was generated at baseline and followups using 55 regional cortical thickness and subcortical volumes measures that extracted by the FreeSurfer longitudinal stream. Results: MCI-p subjects had a faster increase of the SI over time (p < 0.001). A higher SI at baseline in MCI-p was related to progression to AD at earlier follow-ups (p < 0.001) and worse cognitive impairment (p < 0.001). AD-like MCI patients with the APOE \u03b54 allele and abnormal A\u03b2 levels had a faster increase of the SI, independently (p = 0.003 and p = 0.004). Conclusions: Longitudinal changes in the SI reflect structural brain changes and can identify MCI patients at risk of progression to AD. Disease-related brain structural changes are influenced independently by APOE genotype and amyloid pathology. The SI has the potential to be used as a sensitive tool to predict future dementia, monitor disease progression as well as an outcome measure for clinical trials."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is a neurodegenerative disorder that is clinically characterized by gradual loss of cognitive functions. While the definitive AD diagnosis requires postmortem autopsy-confirmed existence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain tissue (Khachaturian, 1985; Markesbery, 1997) , the diagnosis of possible or probable AD is based on clinical signs and symptoms. However, the new diagnostic criteria recommend that the clinical diagnosis should be supported by the use of biomarkers from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (McKhann et al., 2011) . The disease onset is estimated to be a decade or more before clinical appearance (Jack et al., 2013; Jack et al., 2010a) . Therefore, at the time of diagnosis, irreversible brain damage has already occurred. An early and accurate diagnosis of AD will be extremely important when diseasemodifying treatments exist. Unfortunately, at the moment, only symptomatic treatments are available.\nMild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate condition between normal cognition and dementia that involves noticeable decline in cognitive abilities. MCI often represents a prodromal form of dementia, conferring a significantly higher risk of converting to AD (Gauthier et al., 2006) . However, MCI is a heterogeneous condition, i.e. not all MCI subjects develop dementia even after several years of follow-up. Therefore, studying MCI is useful because it offers opportunities for relatively early diagnosis of AD by identifying MCI patients at risk of developing AD.\nThere is still a need to validate existing biomarkers for early detection of the disease and investigate new diagnostic tools. MRI has been widely studied in clinical trials for early detection of AD and MCI. Cognitive impairment in AD and MCI subjects is associated with neuron loss and progressive cerebral atrophy (Serrano-Pozo et al., 2011) . Advanced image processing and data analysis techniques provide tools to detect these structural changes in MRI and extract disease-related information (Falahati et al., 2014) . Atrophy of medial temporal structures, particularly in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex is consistent findings in AD (Morra et al., 2009) . However, atrophy of medial temporal structures or ventricular enlargement is not specific to AD. The absence of atrophy does not exclude a diagnosis of AD either. Measures of single structures are probably insufficient for accurate AD diagnosis. It has previously been shown that a combination of different structural measures is more accurate for distinguishing AD from cognitively normal (CN) subjects and predicting future conversion from MCI to AD (Kloppel et al., 2008; Westman et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2011) . Recently, we proposed a methodology using multivariate analysis of automated MRI-derived structural measures (global and regional thickness and volumes) to generate a disease severity index (SI) (Aguilar et al., 2014; Spulber et al., 2013) . The SI summarizes the patterns of structural brain changes as a single score for each individual subject, based on the observed patterns in AD and CN subjects. The methodology has been evaluated in the AddNeuroMed (large European multi-center study) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle flagship study of aging (AIBL) cohorts (Ferreira et al., 2017; Mangialasche et al., 2013; Westman et al., 2011) .\nThe present study builds on our previous work to generate the SI, but we have made several methodological improvements. Longitudinal image processing in FreeSurfer is employed for the first time to generate regional volume and thickness measures. This reduces the inter-individual variability and increases the accuracy of the extracted structural measures (Reuter et al., 2012) . By improving the input features for multivariate analysis, we can study changes in the patterns of atrophy, investigate disease progression and evaluate the performance of the SI more accurately. We have added age correction (Falahati et al., 2016) to further improve the accuracy of the SI. This has not previously been applied longitudinally. We have only described longitudinal changes in the SI once before in a small sample of MCI subject with short follow-up time (one year). In the present study we have a much larger sample size and subjects are followed-up for three years (baseline, 12-, 24-and 36month) . To have a sufficient follow-up time is important to evaluate small change as well as study the relationship between the SI to cognition and APOE genotype. Finally, changes in the SI have not previously been investigated in relation to amyloid burden in the brain as well as how sensitive it is to predict and monitor time to conversion to AD."}, {"section_title": "Material and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "A total of 568 subjects (AD = 195, MCI = 145, CN = 228) were included in the current study. For AD, follow-up data were available up to 24 months. All MCI and 129 CN subjects had a 36 months follow-up. Out of 145 MCI subjects, 70 subjects progressed from MCI to AD (MCIp) and 75 subjects remained stable or returned to normal cognition (MCI-s) within the 36 months follow-up period. Besides, during the 36 months period, 11 CN subjects progressed to MCI or AD. The demographics of participants are given in Table 1 .\nThe dataset used was obtained from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), private pharmaceutical companies and non-profit organizations (Mueller et al., 2005) . The primary goal of ADNI is to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessments can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. The Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center and University of California -San Francisco.

MCI diagnosis required a MMSE score between 24 and 30; memory complaints; normal activities of daily living; total CDR score of 0.5; and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) score of \u2264 5. The inclusion criteria for control participants were a MMSE score between 24 and 30; total CDR score of 0; and GDS score \u2264 5. No significant neurological or psychiatric illness, no significant unstable systemic illness or organ failure, and no history of alcohol or substance abuse or dependence were required for all three groups.

(2010) ."}, {"section_title": "MRI data acquisition", "text": "1.5T MRI data was collected from a variety of MR-systems with protocols optimized for each type of scanner. The MRI protocol included a high resolution sagittal 3D T1-weighted MPRAGE volume (voxel size 1.1 \u00d7 1.1 \u00d7 1.2 mm 3 ) acquired using a custom pulse sequence specifically designed for the ADNI study to ensure compatibility across scanners (Jack et al., 2008a) ."}, {"section_title": "Longitudinal MRI processing", "text": "MRI scans were automatically processed with the FreeSurfer pipeline (version 5.3.0), http://freesurfer.net/. The Freesurfer longitudinal stream (Reuter et al., 2012) was used to extract regional cortical thickness and subcortical volumetric measures. The longitudinal processing pipeline includes three steps. Initially all baseline and follow-up time points were cross-sectionally processed with the default workflow. Then an unbiased within-subject template volume (Reuter and Fischl, 2011) was created from all time points using inverse consistent registration (Reuter et al., 2010) . Afterwards, all time points were longitudinally processed. In the latter step, the unbiased template was used as initial guess of several segmentation and reconstruction steps for processing each time point. Since segmentation and parcellation procedures are highly sensitive to algorithm initialization, using the unbiased template reduces the random variation in the processing procedure and increases reliability and robustness of the overall longitudinal analysis (Reuter et al., 2012) .\nFinally, for each time point 55 MRI measures including 34 regional cortical thickness measures and 21 regional subcortical volumes were extracted. Both cortical and subcortical regions are involved in AD and the combination of the two has previously been shown to give the best results for discriminating between AD and CN as well as predicting future conversion to AD from MCI (Lerch et al., 2008; Li et al., 2012; Westman et al., 2013) . Measures from the left and right sides of the brain were averaged. All subcortical volumetric measures from each subject were normalized by the subject's intracranial volume (Voevodskaya et al., 2014) , which was estimated based on an affine transform in FreeSurfer. Cortical thickness measures were not normalized and were used in their raw form . Data was processed through the hive database system (theHiveDB) ."}, {"section_title": "APOE genotyping and CSF A\u03b2", "text": "APOE genotyping was performed at screening using DNA obtained from subjects peripheral blood samples (Saykin et al., 2010) .

The details of the measurement method are provided elsewhere (Shaw et al., 2009) .

Briefly, the age-related structural changes are estimated as a linear association between each MRI-derived variable and age at baseline, in the CN group only. The age correction is based only on the CN group to remove age related changes, while keep the changes related to disease. Then, the age-related changes were detrended from all individuals by subtracting the estimated linear trend. Afterwards, pre-processing was performed on the unbiased age corrected MRI data using mean-centering and unit variance scaling in order to transform the data into a suitable form (Eriksson et al., 2013) . In addition, all data (including CN, MCI and AD subjects) was tested using a scatter plot of the first and second PCA components and Hotelling's T-squared elliptical range with 95% and 99% confidence intervals, to reveal the homogeneity, check whether data was normally distributed and detect outlier samples.\nOrthogonal projection to latent structures (OPLS) (Bylesj\u00f6 et al., 2006; Trygg and Wold, 2002) , a supervised multivariate data analysis method was used to classify AD patients and CN individuals as well as to predict progression in the MCI patients. The OPLS method is an extension to the projection to latent structures (PLS) method (Wold et al., 1984) . PLS has been developed for the purpose of modelling complex data based on the assumption that there are latent variables that generate the observed data. PLS extracts these latent variables by maximizing the covariance between two sets of data, descriptor and response variables. In OPLS, the systematic variation in descriptor data is separated into two blocks, predictive variation correlated to response data and non-predictive variation orthogonal to response data. This separation improves the model transparency and reduces the model complexity. For the two-class discriminant problem OPLS has an advantage over PLS that provides only one single predictive component (first component) and the other orthogonal components (if any) are not important for class separation. Accordingly, one single loading vector describes the class discriminating variables. The OPLS model generates an index (the SI) for each subject which is the estimated value of the response variable. The generated index is a scalar value in the range of \u2212 1 to 2, which is close to one for AD subjects and close to zero for CN subjects.\nIn this work, the extracted data from baseline AD and CN scans is used to train an OPLS model. The performance of the OPLS model was quantified by the goodness of fit (R 2 ) and the goodness of prediction (Q 2 ) parameters (Eriksson et al., 2013) . R 2 shows how well the model fits the training data and Q 2 shows how reliable the model predicts new data. In addition the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (Metz, 1978) and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) were used as a performance metric of the classification model.\nFollowing the training phase, the trained model is used to predict the rest of the scans (i.e. baseline and follow-up MCI scans as well as follow-up AD and CN scans). Correspondingly, a SI is assigned to each predicted subject, where a SI close to 1 displays a pattern similar to AD (AD-like) and a SI close to 0 displays a pattern similar to CN (CN-like). We used the distribution of the baseline SI of CN subjects (in the training model) to calculate the cut-off for labeling subjects as AD-like or CN-like. A Gaussian distribution model fitted to baseline SI of nonprogressive CN subject (excluding 11 subjects who progressed to MCI or AD within 36 months follow-up). The cut-off was through this procedure set to 0.372 (mean SI of CN subjects = 0.172 + one standard deviation = 0.2). We based the calculation of the cut-off on a previous study for determining deviation from normality to define cognitive impairment (Busse et al., 2006) . The authors reported that the criteria based on a 1 SD cut-off to define MCI lead to the highest relative predictive power for the development of dementia (Busse et al., 2006) .\nVertex analysis using the FreeSurfer software was performed to compare cortical thickness between AD-like and CN-like MCI subjects. In this approach a general linear model is fitted at each vertex, where the dependent variable is cortical thickness and diagnostic group is the independent variable. In order to correct for multiple comparisons, Monte Carlo Null-Z simulations were used with a cluster-forming threshold of p < 0.05 (two-sided).\nMixed ANOVA/ANCOVA with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons were conducted to study time effect, group effect and time \u00d7 group interaction on longitudinal SI changes. A Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied when the assumption of sphericity was violated. All mixed ANOVA analyses were adjusted for age and gender as covariates. The results of tests are reported in terms of F-statistic as: F (df-variable, df-error) = F-value, p-value. Linear regression analyses were conducted to study the associations between the SI and MMSE as well as their changes. The MMSE score as the dependent variable and the SI, baseline age and gender as independent variables were included in the regression models. To compare regression models, the interaction of the SI and predicted diagnosis were included in the model. Linear regression results were reported as: standardized coefficient, p-value."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Initially, an OPLS model was trained with baseline CN and AD scans. The trained model resulted in cross validated classification accuracy = 87.2%, sensitivity = 91.3% and specificity = 83.8%. The classification model resulted in R 2 = 0.887 and Q 2 = 0.609. Fig. 1A shows the histograms of the baseline SI for CN and AD subjects. Fig. 1B shows the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the trained model, with the area under ROC curve of 0.95.\nThe trained model was used to assign a SI to each MCI subject at baseline and follow-up time points as well as follow-up time points of CN and AD subjects. Fig. 1C shows the boxplot of the SI at different time points and diagnoses. As expected, the average SI was the highest in AD subjects followed by MCI and then CN subjects. Fig. 2A shows the variables of importance for AD vs. CN classification model. The most influential measures in class separation were structures in medial temporal lobe such as hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and amygdala. The cortical thickness map of AD-like and CN-like MCI subjects from vertex analysis (Fig. 2B) showed that AD-like MCI subjects had reduced thickness in entorhinal cortex, fusiform, temporal pole as well as superior-, middle-, and inferior-temporal gyrus. Table 2 summarizes the number of correctly predicted MCI-p subjects at different time points. Using the baseline SI, 95.7% of the MCI-p subjects that progressed during the first year of follow-up were correctly identified as AD-like, 78.1% of subjects who progressed during the second year and 60% of the subjects that progressed during the third year (totally 56 out of 70, i.e. 80%). Using the baseline SI, 43 MCIs subjects (57.3%) were predicted as CN-like and 32 as AD-like (42.7%). Based on 3 years follow-up diagnosis, the baseline SI resulted in an accuracy = 68.3%, sensitivity = 80% and specificity = 57.3% for prediction of progression from MCI to AD.\nA mixed ANOVA was conducted to compare changes in the SI in MCI-p and MCI-s subjects over 36 months. A significant time \u00d7 group interaction was observed (F (2,294) = 39.5, p < 0.001) where the SI of MCI-p subjects increased faster compared to MCI-s (Fig. 3A) . Further, MCI-p and MCI-s subjects were stratified by the predicted patterns of atrophy (i.e. AD-like and CN-like) using the baseline SI. Within both the AD-like and CN-like group, significant time \u00d7 group interactions were observed (F (2,168) = 14.9, p < 0.001 and F (2,120) = 4.9, p = 0.006, respectively) where the SI increased faster in MCI-p subjects compared to MCI-s, independently of MCI subjects being AD-like or CN-like ( Fig. 3B) .

The mixed ANOVA showed a significant time \u00d7 group interaction (F (8,287) = 10.7, p < 0.001). Bonferroni corrected post hoc tests showed that the SI of subjects who progressed at month-12 were significantly higher than subjects who progressed at month-36 and MCI-s with an AD-like pattern (p = 0.026 and p = 0.032, respectively). Interestingly, no significant differences were observed between subjects who progressed at month-24, subjects who progressed at month-36 and MCI-s with an AD-like pattern. The SI of MCI-s subjects with CN-like pattern was significantly lower than the rest of the subjects (p < 0.001). Fig. 3C shows the average SI of MCI-p subjects that progressed within the first, second and third year of follow-up.\nIn the next step the association between the SI and cognitive performance (thorough MMSE score) was studied in MCI subjects. At baseline, a significant association (\u03b2 = \u22120.325, p = 0.001) was observed. The associations became stronger at follow-up, where the strongest association was seen at month-36 (\u03b2 = \u22120.605, p < 0.001) followed by month-24 (\u03b2 = \u2212 0.561, p < 0.001) and month-12 (\u03b2 = \u22120.507, p < 0.001). Moreover, the association between the changes in the SI and in MMSE over 36 months was calculated which resulted in an even stronger association (\u03b2 = \u2212 0.663, p-value < 0.001). Further, the association between MMSE change and SI change over 36 months was compared between MCI subjects with AD-like and CN-like pattern (Fig. 4) , where a significant difference (pvalue = 0.001) was observed between regression coefficients of subjects with AD-like patterns (\u03b2 = \u22120.631, p-value < 0.001) and subjects with CN-like patterns (\u03b2 = \u22120.206, p-value = 0.221).

This was investigated in two separate mixed ANCOVAs since the reduced size of some of the subgroups did not allow testing for a triple interaction, i.e. time \u00d7 APOE group \u00d7 A\u03b2 group. The mixed ANCOVA showed a significant time \u00d7 APOE group interaction (F (2,156) = 5.1, p = 0.006, adjusted for A\u03b2 group as covariate), where the SI increased faster over time in \u03b54 + compared to \u03b54 \u2212 (Fig. 5A ). Likewise, a significant time \u00d7 A\u03b2 group interaction was found (F (2,156) = 3.9, p = 0.021, adjusted for APOE group) where A\u03b2 + subjects had a faster increase of the SI compared to A\u03b2 \u2212 subjects (Fig. 5B) .\nNext, the MCI subjects were divided into AD-like and CN-like and analogous mixed ANOVA were performed to evaluate the effect of APOE and A\u03b2 within each group.

The proposed method for generating the SI summarizes multiple MRI-derived structural measures of the brain in a single score. The multivariate OPLS model that generates the SI is trained using AD and CN subjects. Therefore, the model captures the most discriminative patterns of AD and CN subjects. Based on the SI, the MCI subjects can be divided into AD-like or CN-like. In the CN-like group, the dominant structural patterns are close to the structural patterns of CN subjects i.e. less atrophied structures and smaller ventricles. On the other hand, the AD-like group expresses structural patterns similar to AD, i.e. greater atrophy in medial temporal structures as Fig. 3.

B) The average SI of MCI-p and MCI-s subjects stratified by the predicted patterns (AD-like and CN-like). Within both AD-like and CN-like groups, the SI was higher and increased faster in MCI-p subjects (p < 0.001 and p = 0.006, respectively). C) The average SI of MCI-p stratified by time of conversion. The average SI of subjects who progressed at month-12 was significantly higher than the average of those who progressed at month-36 (p = 0.026). There was no significant difference between MCI-p that progressed at month-24 and those who progressed at month-36.

In this work the SI was studied longitudinally. The average SI was higher in AD subjects compared to MCI and CN subjects.\nThe results in this study show that in AD and MCI subjects the average SI increased over time, but in CN subjects, it remained stable. This is in line with previous cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that reported increased rates of regional and whole brain atrophy in MCI and AD subjects (Jack et al., 2004; Leung et al., 2013; Schuff et al., 2012; Sluimer et al., 2009; Spulber et al., 2012) . A higher average SI was also observed in MCI-p subjects compared to MCI-s subjects, which is in line with previous findings of higher rates of atrophy in progressive MCI subjects (Desikan et al., 2008; Jack et al., 2004; Jack et al., 2008b; Orellana et al., 2016) . The most influential variables in the classification model of AD and CN subjects were measures of structures in medial temporal lobe. Results from the cortical thickness map from vertex analysis showed significant cortical thinning of similar regions in ADlike MCI subjects compared to CN-like MCI subjects.\nThe accuracy of AD versus CN classification in this work was in the level of the reported accuracies in previous studies using ADNI cohort (between 80% and 90% (Falahati et al., 2014) ), though higher classification accuracies are also reported (Liu et al., 2013b; Wee et al., 2013; Westman et al., 2013; Wolz et al., 2011) . Compared to a recent study (Hu et al., 2016) that used a very similar longitudinal dataset, we obtained a higher classification accuracy (87.2% compared to 84.1%). The baseline SI showed a high sensitivity, 80% over a period of 3 years (95.7% within the first year) for prediction of progression from MCI to AD. The sensitivity of detecting progressive MCI individuals using baseline SI is higher in the present study compared to the sensitivities (65%-75%) which have been reported in previous studies (Liu et al., 2013b; Wee et al., 2013; Wolz et al., 2011) . The accuracy for predicting conversion from MCI to AD was at the same level of these studies. Fig. 5 .

B) The SI increased faster in A\u03b2 + subjects compared to A\u03b2 \u2212 subjects (p = 0.021). C) Within AD-like subjects, the \u03b54 + group had a greater increase of the SI compared to the \u03b54 \u2212 group (p = 0.003), but there is no significant difference within CN-like subjects. D) Within AD-like subjects, A\u03b2 + had a greater increase of the SI compared to the A\u03b2 \u2212 group (p = 0.004), but there was no significant difference within CN-like subjects. CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; SI, disease severity index; AD, Alzheimer's disease; CN, cognitively normal subjects; MCI, mild cognitive impairment, Error bars show 95% confidence intervals. However, 3 years is relatively short follow-up time for MCI subjects. A longer follow-up time is needed for reporting more accurate prediction rates, particularly for MCI-s subjects.\nCompared to our previous work, we used a lower cut-off which is calculated based on the distribution of the SI in CN subjects (cutoff = 0.372 instead of a strict arbitrary cut-off of 0.5). Since the current cut-off is based on normal variation in a group of healthy controls, the cut-off has better clinical applicability and should facilitate the use of the SI as diagnostic tool. On the contrary, the previously used cut-off of 0.5 is dependent on variation within the AD. Variation within AD is most likely to be larger than in normal healthy individuals. We know from previous work that AD is a very heterogeneous disorder and several subtypes have been defined with different patterns of atrophy (Ferreira et al., 2015; Lam et al., 2013; Noh et al., 2014; Pereira et al., 2014) . Naturally, part of the variation in CN subjects is due to normal aging, which is reduced by applying age correction. Further, with the current cut-off we increase the sensitivity to 91.3% for classifying AD subjects, which is in line with a previous study showing that around 10% of diagnosed AD subjects show no atrophy compared to controls (Byun et al., 2015) . With the current cut-off we can also classify 80% of the MCI converters at baseline correctly. This number increases the closer it gets to time of conversion to dementia. This supports the notion that structural changes measured by MRI are a good progression marker rather than a staging marker since they are so closely related to cognitive function (Jack et al., 2013) . Further, 43% of the stable MCI subjects have an AD-like pattern of atrophy. Although a yearly conversion rate of 10-15% from MCI to dementia is usually mentioned in the literature (Farias et al., 2009 ), this figure ranges widely between studies (4-36%) (Bennett et al., 2002) . Taking this into account, our stable MCI subjects with an AD-like pattern of atrophy will likely convert to dementia in the future. This is further supported by the fact the MCI-s subjects with an AD-like pattern had a very similar baseline SI and SI progression as the MCI-p subjects whom converted at month 36. However, we cannot confirm this with the current data and a longer follow-up is needed. Finally, 57% of the stable MCI subject had a CNlike pattern (30% of the total sample). These subjects could potentially represent subjects that will never develop dementia (Bennett et al., 2002) .\nThe relation between brain structures and cognitive performance in AD has previously been investigated and positive correlations between MMSE scores and cortical and subcortical volumes and negative correlations with the volume of the ventricles have been reported (Ferrarini et al., 2008; Fjell et al., 2009; Orellana et al., 2016) . In this study, we observed strong negative correlations between the SI (as a summary of structural measures) and MMSE score in MCI subjects at baseline and follow-up. In addition, a strong correlation was observed between the change of the SI and the change of MMSE scores during 36 months. This is in line with previous reports on the associations of brain atrophy rates and ventricular enlargement with MMSE changes (Evans et al., 2010; Orellana et al., 2016; Yao et al., 2012) . The regression coefficient was larger in AD-like MCI subjects compared to CNlike subjects, which might indicate a higher risk of developing AD in AD-like MCI subjects (Sluimer et al., 2008) .\nAPOE genotype is the main genetic risk factor in sporadic AD. APOE \u03b54 carriers have an increased risk of developing AD compared to \u03b53 and \u03b52 carriers (Chartier-Harlin et al., 1994) . The effect of APOE \u03b54 on atrophy rates in AD and MCI subjects has been studied and increased atrophy rates were reported in different brain structures particularly in the medial temporal lobe and hippocampus (Goni et al., 2013; Li et al., 2016; Soldan et al., 2015; Wahlund et al., 1999) . In this work, a significant higher average SI and a faster increase of the SI was observed in \u03b54 + MCI subjects compared to \u03b54 \u2212 MCI subjects. Since the measures of medial temporal lobe structures are given greater weights in generating the SI, this result intensify the previous findings that \u03b54 allele drives atrophy to the medial-temporal lobe (Manning et al., 2014) . However, this result might also indicate that the presence of the \u03b54 allele affects other brain areas. Interestingly, within AD-like MCI subjects a faster increase of SI in \u03b54 + subjects compared to \u03b54 \u2212 subjects was observed, but not in CN-like MCI subjects. This suggests that the presence of the \u03b54 allele accelerates atrophy in subjects with positive disease biomarkers (Khan et al., 2017) .\nThe longitudinal changes of the SI were also studied in relation to CSF A\u03b2 levels. AD is associated with deposition of A\u03b2 in the brain, which is reflected by low concentration of the A\u03b2 peptide in the CSF (Portelius et al., 2010) . Low CSF A\u03b2 levels are also associated with an increased risk of progressing from MCI to AD (Hansson et al., 2006; Herukka et al., 2005; Jack et al., 2010b) . Our results show an increased rate of atrophy in A\u03b2 + subjects compared to A\u03b2 \u2212 subjects, which is compatible with a previous study that reported a significant correlation between lower A\u03b2 levels and lower brain volume as well as larger ventricular volume in progressive MCI subjects (Wahlund and Blennow, 2003) . Moreover, a faster increase of the SI was observed in AD-like A\u03b2 + subjects, suggesting that the abnormal A\u03b2 levels can accelerate brain atrophy. This result is analogous to the above findings about ADlike \u03b54 + subjects. APOE genotype has a strong role in A\u03b2 metabolism where altered APOE alleles affect the A\u03b2 deposition differently (Castellano et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2013a) . Because of limited number of subjects with A\u03b2 \u2212 and \u03b54 + we could not test for an interaction between amyloid pathology and APOE genotype. Alternatively, APOE genotype and A\u03b2 group were included as covariates in the mixed ANCOVA. These results suggest that disease-related structural brain changes are influenced independently by APOE genotype and amyloid pathology. However, unlike APOE genotype, the A\u03b2 levels are variable and the baseline levels here may become abnormal in the future. Further investigations on the association between longitudinal changes in CSF biomarkers and the SI are necessary.\nAdditionally, the effect of APOE and CSF A\u03b2 on SI was examined in 129 CN subjects with 36 months follow-up. Although similar trends were visible, the effects of APOE and A\u03b2 on the SI were not statistically significant. This is compatible with previous studies that reported no significant association of APOE and A\u03b2 with hippocampal loss in CN subjects (Khan et al., 2014; Schuff et al., 2009) . Future studies with longer follow-up time and larger sample sizes could be beneficial to assess the effect of APOE and A\u03b2 on the SI in CN subjects.\nIn this study, the SI is evaluated using a series of MRI scans that are processed longitudinally. An advantage of the longitudinal processing pipeline compared to cross sectional analysis is the increased reliability and robustness of the overall image processing analysis (Reuter et al., 2012) . Consequently, the extracted MRI measures, the multivariate model and finally the generated SI are more reliable. Moreover, a longitudinal SI reflects changes in brain structures over a period of time, not only at a single time point. This provides information on disease dynamics rather than static information, which helps to monitor progression in MCI subjects as well as finding diversities in this group. This study is conducted in the ADNI cohort, which is a highly selective cohort. Therefore, these results should be validated in other cohorts, preferably in non-selected clinical data."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The SI and its longitudinal changes show great potential for identifying MCI patients at risk of progressing to AD. Progressive MCI patients evidenced a greater SI and a faster increase of the SI. The SI was not only different between progressive and stable MCI, but we could also clearly see differences in the index within the progressive group. The value of the SI was significantly higher and the rate of decline was faster depending on at which time point subjects converted. This is important for prognosis and inclusion in clinical trials. A greater SI in MCI patients was also as expected associated with worse cognitive impairment. Further, MCI patients carrying the APOE \u03b54 allele and abnormal CSF A\u03b2 levels had greater SI and faster rate of atrophy. Our results suggest that disease-related brain structural changes are modulated independently by APOE genotype and amyloid pathology. Therefore, the SI has a great potential to be employed in clinical trials as an inclusion criteria, monitoring disease progression or a simplified outcome. Ultimately, we believe that the SI has the potential to be implemented in clinical setup to aid early diagnosis and predict MCI progression to AD.\nSupplementary data to this article can be found online at http://dx. doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2017.08.014."}]
