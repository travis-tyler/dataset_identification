[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract To examine how maternal and paternal pregnancy wantedness and couple concordance regarding pregnancy wantedness predict children's social-emotional development in kindergarten. We used data from nationally representative US sample from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Birth Cohort. Exposures of interest were maternal and paternal pregnancy wantedness, and couple concordance regarding pregnancy wantedness. Children's social-emotional development was evaluated by the child's kindergarten teacher using an adapted version of the Preschool and Kindergarten Behavior Scales. We examined bivariate associations between pregnancy wantedness and key socio-demographic variables in relation to children's social-emotional development. Multiple linear regression was used to assess the relationship between each pregnancy wantedness predictor and children's social-emotional development scores. Items related to child concentration and attention appeared to be the components driving almost all the associations with socialemotional development. Maternal report of unwanted pregnancy, resident father's report of mistimed pregnancy, and discordance of parental pregnancy wantedness (specifically when the mother wanted but the father did not want the pregnancy) predicted lower children's socialemotional development scores. Results suggest that maternal unwanted pregnancy and couple discordance in pregnancy wantedness were associated with poorer socialemotional development, especially in the area of concentration and attention, in kindergarten."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The estimated prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems among children living in the United States ranges from approximately 2 to 7 % among certain subpopulations [1, 2] . Children in single-parent households and low-income families have higher rates of socialemotional and behavioral problems compared to other children [1] . Poor social and emotional development in early childhood is a risk factor for adverse health and continued social-emotional difficulties in adolescence and adulthood, including psychosocial problems, such as depression and loneliness, substance abuse, and adult criminality [3] [4] [5] [6] . Children with serious emotional and behavioral problems are more likely to receive special education and use mental health services than children without emotional and behavioral problems, resulting in significant costs to society [7] .\nPregnancy wantedness and intentions have been linked to parental prenatal and postnatal behaviors that have the potential to have long-term effects on their children. Unintended and unwanted pregnancies have been associated with underutilized prenatal care [8] [9] [10] , low birth weight and preterm births [11] [12] [13] , reduced breastfeeding practices [14, 15] , and decreased support among fathers [16] , all of which could have an impact on child development. Research examining the relationship between parental pregnancy intentions and later child developmental outcomes has been limited [17] [18] [19] [20] . Especially little is known about the link between concordance between couple's pregnancy intentions and child developmental outcomes [10, 15] . Therefore, we examined how maternal and paternal pregnancy wantedness and couple concordance regarding pregnancy wantedness predict children's social-emotional development among kindergarten-aged children in the United States."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Design and Sample", "text": "We used data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Birth Cohort (ECLS-B) 9-month parent surveys collected by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), US Department of Education to assess pregnancy wantedness of the mother, resident father, and of the couple jointly, in relation to children's social-emotional development as assessed by kindergarten teachers.\nStarting in 2001, the ECLS-B followed children from infancy through kindergarten, at four points in time: 9 months, 2 years of age, 4 years of age, and kindergarten in 2006 and 2007. Children who had not yet started kindergarten in 2006 and those children who repeated kindergarten were included in the 2007 wave of data collection. Data were collected on maternal and paternal (both resident and non-resident) characteristics and behaviors and children's cognitive, physical, social-emotional, psychomotor, and physical development from birth through kindergarten. These data were obtained through birth certificates, direct child assessments, and selfadministered and computer-assisted personal interviews with mother and fathers or other caregivers [21] .\nThe ECLS-B is a longitudinal study with a nationally representative sample of more than 10,000 children in the United States. Only children with completed teacher assessments on the social-emotional development scale (4,650 children) were included in analyses. The main reasons for not having a completed teacher assessment were that the child was not in kindergarten, the child was home schooled, non-response from teachers, or the parent did not provide consent [21] . Regarding the analysis of maternal and paternal pregnancy wantedness, of the 4,650 total teacher's assessments on individual children, there were 500 and 850 missing maternal and paternal questionnaires, respectively. There were also 50 and 1,200 missing maternal and resident father's pregnancy wantedness item responses, respectively, leaving a final analytic sample of 4,100 mothers and children and 2,600 fathers and children in our study. The couple level analyses were restricted to children with a completed teacher assessment and both maternal and paternal questionnaires with the pregnancy wantedness item responses included, which resulted in an analytic sample of 1,150 (see Fig. 1 )."}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Children's Social-Emotional Development", "text": "The outcome variable used in our analyses was children's social-emotional development. It was assessed using a twenty-one-item scale included in the teacher questionnaire that was administered to kindergarten teachers in 2006 and 2007 about the social and emotional behaviors of their students. Scale items were from the Preschool and Kindergarten Behavior Scales-Second Edition [22] along with other items constructed specifically for the ECLS-B. These items assessed social-emotional behaviors of children as observed by their teachers; for example, whether the child is accepted and liked by other children, makes friends easily, pays attention well, and shares with others. Response categories ranged from 0 (never) to 4 (very often). Items that referred to negative behaviors, such as whether the child is restless and fidgety or has outbursts or tantrums, were reverse coded so that higher scores represented more positive social-emotional skills. Children's social-emotional development score was constructed by taking the average of all items actually reported and ranged from 0 to 4. The scale had high reliability in this sample; the Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.93."}, {"section_title": "Pregnancy Wantedness", "text": "The main predictor in the analysis was pregnancy wantedness, which we evaluated for the mothers, resident fathers, and in terms of the concordance between the two. Pregnancy wantedness was measured using a series of survey items administered at 9 months postpartum. Participants were asked, ''Before you [your partner] became pregnant with your baby, had you or your baby's father [mother] stopped using all methods of birth control?'' Participants who responded ''Yes'' or ''Never used birth control'' were then asked, ''Why were you or your baby's father [mother] not using any birth control?'' Response categories included ''wanted to get pregnant'' among other reasons. Participants who responded that they ''wanted to get pregnant'' were then asked, ''Did you become pregnant sooner than you wanted, later than you wanted, or about the right time?'' All other participants, regardless of whether they had stopped using birth control were asked, ''At the time you [your partner] became pregnant with your baby, did you yourself actually want to have a baby at some time?'' followed by the question on the timing of the pregnancy. We used three categories for assessing pregnancy wantedness in separate analyses for both mother and resident father analyses: ''wanted'', ''mistimed'', and ''unwanted.'' For mothers, a pregnancy was defined as ''wanted'' if (1) she responded that she wanted to get pregnant when asked why she and her baby's father were not using any birth control OR (2) ''yes'' or ''probably yes'' that she herself actually wanted to have a baby at some time at the time that she became pregnant AND ''yes'' that she became pregnant at about the right time. A pregnancy was defined as ''mistimed'' if the mother responded that she wanted or probably wanted to have a baby at some time but became pregnant sooner or later than she wanted. A pregnancy was defined as ''unwanted'' if the mother responded that she did not want or probably did not want to have a(nother) baby at some time.\nThe same three categories were used to assess resident father's pregnancy wantedness, using the two items included in the resident father questionnaire. For resident fathers, a pregnancy was defined as ''wanted'' if the resident father responded that, at the time that his spouse/ partner became pregnant with the child he 'wanted his spouse/partner to have a(nother) baby at some time' OR if he responded that his spouse/partner became pregnant at about the right time. A pregnancy was defined as ''mistimed'' if the father responded that he wanted his spouse/ partner to have a(nother) baby at some time but that she became pregnant sooner or later than he wanted. A pregnancy was defined as ''unwanted'' if the resident father responded that he did not want his spouse/partner to have a(nother) baby at some time.\nTo assess couple pregnancy wantedness, four categories were constructed using the maternal pregnancy wantedness and resident father pregnancy wantedness variables described above: ''mother and father wanted'', ''mother wanted, father did not want'', ''mother did not want, father wanted'', and ''mother and father did not want.'' Because we were interested in couple discordance in terms of pregnancy wantedness, responses of mistimed pregnancy were not included in the couplelevel variable.

Sample weights were applied to account for stratification, clustering, and unit non-response. In addition, we conducted an exploratory factor analysis with all socialemotional development scale items with promax rotation to allow correlation among factors.

There was a weak inverse association between mothers' report of mistimed pregnancies and children's social-emotional developmental score in unadjusted models, however significance was lost after adjustment for covariates.

These subscales are consistent with the dimensions of social-emotional development reported in the literature [1] . Mothers', fathers', and couples' pregnancy wantedness was significantly associated with children's concentration and attention in the unadjusted and adjusted models. After adjusting for maternal socio-demographic characteristics, children born to mothers who reported an unwanted pregnancy had significantly lower scores in the domain of concentration and attention compared to children born to mothers who reported wanting the pregnancy (see Table 5 ). Children born to mothers who reported the pregnancy as unwanted also had lower scores in the conduct dimension of social-emotional development (Adjusted b = -0.15; 95 % CI -0.27, -0.03) (Data not shown). Regarding the resident father adjusted and unadjusted subanalyses, individual sub-scales for children's social-emotional development revealed that children born to resident fathers who reported their pregnancy as unwanted or mistimed had lower concentration and attention scores than children born to resident fathers who reported wanting the pregnancy (see Table 5 ). In the couple-level sub-analyses, discordance in couple pregnancy wantedness, specifically when the mother reported wanting the pregnancy and the resident father reported not wanting the pregnancy, was significantly associated with lower scores in concentration and attention (see Table 5 ).

Children born to mothers reporting having not wanted the pregnancy had lower social-emotional development scores in kindergarten than those born to mothers who wanted the pregnancy. Children born to fathers who reported that the pregnancy was mistimed also had poorer social-emotional development outcomes compared to children born to fathers who reported wanting the pregnancy. Couple discordance in pregnancy intention, in which the mother wanted and father did not want the pregnancy, was associated with lower social-emotional development scores of children. Our finding that pregnancies unwanted by the mother are associated with poorer social-emotional development in children is in accordance with previous research [23, 24] . A study conducted in Prague examining the longterm effects of children born to women who were denied abortion showed higher maladaptation scores in children at age 9 along with continued less favorable social and emotional adaptation into adulthood [24] . Using data from the US National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, Joyce et al. [23] showed that youth between the ages of 14 and 21 years born to mothers who reported unwanted pregnancy had more problem behaviors than those youth born to mothers who reported intending to get pregnant. Although some of the items from their measure, the Behavior Problems Index, are represented in the Preschool and Kindergarten Behavior Scales used in our study, our measure of children's social-emotional development has the advantage of being an independent measure based on teacher report of social-emotional development in children within the school setting.\nBarber et al. [25] demonstrated that experiencing an unwanted pregnancy was associated with reduced time and attention that mothers give their young children. Other studies have also reported disturbances in the mother-child relationship due to an unwanted pregnancy [21] . Given that maternal unwanted pregnancy has been found to be associated with maternal depressive symptoms [26] [27] [28] , one explanation for these results is that the depressive symptoms that may result from unwanted childbearing could impact maternal childrearing behaviors.\nRegarding pregnancy wantedness of fathers, we found mistimed pregnancy to be associated with poorer children's social-emotional development. Previously paternal pregnancy wantedness has been shown to be associated with toddlers' mental proficiency and attachment security, mediated by father engagement and mother-father relationship conflict [18] . Although we were surprised to find paternal reports of mistimed pregnancy but not unwanted pregnancy to be associated with lower social-emotional development scores compared to scores of children from wanted pregnancies, one possibility is that this may be attributable to misclassification of paternal pregnancy wantedness due to social desirability. Some fathers may have reported a pregnancy as being mistimed even though they did not want to have a child or another child. In our analysis of couple concordance of pregnancy wantedness, we found an inverse relationship between discordancy in parental pregnancy wantedness and children's social-emotional development scores, specifically when the mother reported wanting the pregnancy and the father reported not wanting the pregnancy. This is in contrast to prior research that has reported little influence of father's pregnancy intentions when there is discordance in pregnancy intentions between parents on the risk of adverse health and developmental outcomes for infants [15] . Interestingly, we did not find unwanted pregnancy reported by both parents to be associated with lower children's social-emotional developmental scores compared to children of parents who both reported wanting the pregnancy. This suggests that discordance in pregnancy wantedness among couples may be an indicator of marital conflict between the mother and the father, which has been associated with poor child development [25] . There is evidence that interventions that address relationship conflict among couples can have a positive impact on child development, including children's social-emotional competence [29, 30] . Kirkland et al. [29] evaluated the impact of a 6-week education program focused on couple and coparenting dynamics and relationship quality on married and unmarried Head Start parents and children. Parents who participated in the relationship education program reported lower levels of co-parenting disagreements and better child social competence and emotional wellbeing compared to parents who did not receive the intervention [29] . Another study found long-lasting 10-year positive effects of a prekindergarten intervention that involved 16 weeks of couples group meetings focused on marital satisfaction and children's adaptation [30] .\nOne limitation of our study was the incomplete data on the main predictor and outcome for some children, especially for fathers. However, given that we are likely to have data missing from children most at risk for having poor social-emotional development scores, their non-inclusion would have resulted in an attenuation of the associations observed. It is also possible that there was some misclassification of pregnancy wantedness due to recall and social desirability. Because the ECLS-B did not survey parents prior to the pregnancy or birth of the child, we had to rely on retrospective accounts. It is possible that parents' reports may have changed over time due to parenting and co-parenting satisfaction and competence, perceptions of marital relationship, and paternal involvement in parenting. Due to the large amounts of missing data and loss to follow-up of non-resident fathers, our analyses were restricted to resident fathers, making it possible that our results are only generalizable to this subset of fathers. Nonetheless, we were able to examine the relationship between parental pregnancy wanted and children's social-emotional development using a nationally representative sample of US two-headed households. This study contributes to a limited body of research as this study sought to fill this gap in our knowledge by examining pregnancy wantedness of the mother, resident father, and of the couple jointly, in relation to children's social-emotional development. To our knowledge, no studies have looked at couple concordance in pregnancy wantedness in relation to children's socialemotional development.\nWe found maternal unwanted pregnancy to be associated with poorer children's social-emotional development in kindergarten. Discordancy in pregnancy wantedness among couples was also adversely associated with children's socialemotional development, particularly in the case that the mother felt that she wanted the pregnancy but that the father did not. Although recall of pregnancy intentions at 9 months postpartum is only a proxy for pregnancy intentions prior to the birth, to the degree that it does reflect actual intentions, this study suggests that mothers' having not wanted the pregnancy and parents with discordant intentions appear to pose a higher risk for poorer child social-emotional development. Given that mothers' retrospective perceptions of pregnancy wantedness are important for child social-emotional development, information about wantedness even gathered in the postpartum period could be used by healthcare personnel to screen for families with children at higher risk. Counseling on the individual, family, or couples' level, may be beneficial. More research is needed to understand mechanisms leading to perceived unwanted pregnancy and discordance in pregnancy intentions in relation to child social-emotional development, and to concentration and attention in particular."}]
