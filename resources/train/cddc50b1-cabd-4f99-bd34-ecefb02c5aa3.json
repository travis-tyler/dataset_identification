Therefore, biomarkers are urgently needed that can be applied in large-scale screening programs to accurately identify individuals with early AD dementia or memoryimpaired older adults at risk of future cognitive decline and associated disability. Established biomarkers including the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins: total-Tau (tTau), phosphorylated-Tau (pTau) 181 , and Amyloid-b (Ab) 1-42 , 1 as well as structural or functional imaging studies 2 show acceptable sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of early AD; furthermore, CSF and imaging research has identified some interesting new marker candidates such as CSF soluble amyloid precursor proteins 3 and amyloid imaging. 4 However, these technology-intensive and costintensive or invasive methods are not suitable for largescale screening programs. As lumbar puncture is a relatively safe procedure that is well tolerated in most instances, 5 it still is an invasive procedure, which restricts its use to a limited number of indications. Hence, biomarkers need to be developed that can be obtained with relative ease from peripheral body fluids to replace or assist CSF biomarkers.\nBlood plasma is an easily accessible body fluid that can be accessed with minimal discomfort to the patient, which facilitates the sampling of large cohorts and serial sampling. The plasma proteome holds great promise for the discovery of biomarkers for a range of diseases since it is in contact and molecular exchange with every organ and tissue including the brain and therefore reflects many physiological and pathophysiological changes. 6 Importantly, for an AD biomarker, the brain uses signaling proteins found in blood to control many body functions, and central and peripheral inflammatory and immune mechanisms are linked to AD. 7 Changes in these signaling proteins associated with AD are likely to cause a disease-specific phenotype in blood. 8 The present study aimed to detect changes due to AD in a comprehensive panel of plasma proteins and to explore whether the results of previous studies are replicable."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Design and Sample", "text": "The data used in this study were obtained from the Alzheimer's Neuroimaging Initiative database (ADNI; see Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/ WAD/A46 for further details).

Information from clinical follow-up visits 6 to 60 months after the baseline assessment was also available for the MCI group.\nThe study was approved by the institutional review boards of all participating centers and written informed consent was obtained from all participants or authorized representatives after extensive description of the ADNI according to the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki.

A 190-analyte multiplex immunoassay panel, referred to as the human discovery map, was developed for the Luminex xMAP platform (Luminex Corp., Austin, TX) by Rules-Based Medicine (RBM Inc., Austin, TX). This assay was designed to contain proteins previously associated with cancer, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders, and inflammation; in addition, plasma proteins believed to be involved in ADassociated cell signaling were included. 8 The analysis of plasma samples on the human discovery map was conducted centrally at the facilities of RBM. The detailed quality control procedures and results are available from the ADNI Web site (http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI). Data of 146 analytes that had passed the strict ADNI quality control were used for the present study (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/ WAD/A46 for a complete listing).\nBaseline CSF samples were obtained from the study participants and analyzed at the ADNI biomarker core laboratory at University of Pennsylvania; the detailed sampling methods have been described previously. 9 The CSF concentrations of Ab 1-42 , tTau, and pTau 181 were measured using the multiplex xMAP Luminex platform with Innogenetics immunoassay kit-based reagents (INNO-BIA AlzBio 3; Ghent, Belgium)."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, v19.0 (IBM corp., Somers, NY) and R-Software, v2.13.0 with the Q-Value package (http://genomics.princeton.edu/ storeylab/qvalue/). 10 Of the 146 RBM analytes, 39 analytes that had passed quality control were excluded from the present analyses because they had >1% missing data, resulting in a final set of 107 plasma proteins. Before the actual statistical analyses, all 107 plasma analytes were assessed for normal distribution within each diagnostic group using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. The false discovery rate, 11 which controls the expected proportion of incorrectly rejected null hypotheses (type I errors), was used to account for the issue of multiple comparisons, that is, results at q < 0.05 were regarded significant.\nA cross-validation study design was used to identify the significant plasma proteins, which is a common procedure in clinical proteomics. 12, 13 The current study population was randomly divided into 1 training sample and 1 test sample including 60% (N CON = 34; N AD dementia = 62) and 40% (N CON = 24; N AD dementia = 47) of the population, respectively. In the training sample, the independent Student t test or the Mann-Whitney U test was used, as appropriate, to compare the RBM analyte concentrations between the CON and AD dementia groups. Subsequently, the significant proteins were used as independent variables in a logistic regression (LR) analysis with stepwise forward variable selection with diagnostic status as the dependent variable (CON vs. AD dementia), followed by a receiveroperating characteristic curve analysis. The same LR model with subsequent receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis was then applied to the validation sample to confirm the results of the test sample. To compare the accuracy of the new plasma biomarkers with established AD markers, the concentrations of Ab 1-42 , tTau, and pTau 181 were tested in a separate LR model in the test sample. Nonparametric correlations (the Spearman rank coefficient) were calculated in the entire study sample to explore the associations between each individual pair of significant blood biomarkers and between the blood and the CSF markers. In addition, Cox proportional hazard models were applied to assess the ability of baseline biomarker levels to predict the progression from MCI to AD dementia. Data of MCI patients who did not progress to the AD dementia stage during a 5-year follow-up period were statistically censored at the date of the last assessment."}, {"section_title": "Pathway Analysis", "text": "The computational gene network prediction tool Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, v8.5 (Ingenuity System, Redwood City, CA) was used to analyze the biological connections of the significant plasma proteins among each other and their probable relation to AD pathology.

In the training set, a total of 7 analyzed plasma proteins showed significant differences after false discovery rate correction in the comparison between the CON group and the AD dementia group, including a-1-microglobulin (A1M; q = 0.03), apolipoprotein E (ApoE; q = 0.03), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP; q = 0.04), betacellulin (BTC; q = 0.02), Eotaxin-3 (q = 0.02), interleukin-16 (IL-16; q = 0.03), and serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT; q = 0.02). These 7 analytes were therefore used as predictors in the subsequent stepwise LR models, in which 5 of these 7 proteins contributed significantly to the differentiation of CON versus AD dementia in the training sample, including A1M (P < 0.01), ApoE (P = 0.001), BNP (P < 0.01), IL-16 (P = 0.0001), and SGOT (P = 0.02). The LR model including the 5 significant proteins (LR Plasma ) had a sensitivity of 87.10% and a specificity of 79.41%. Applied to the validation sample, the LR Plasma model showed comparable results with a sensitivity of 89.36% and a specificity of 79.17%. In comparison, the regression model restricted to the established CSF biomarkers Ab 1-42 , tTau, and pTau 181 (LR CSF ) resulted in a sensitivity of 97.78% and a specificity of 91.30% for the differentiation between CON and AD dementia in the test sample ( Table 2) .\nDuring a maximum of 5-year follow-up, 163 patients with MCI progressed to AD dementia (mean follow-up time 2.77 \u00b1 1.00 y), whereas 217 remained in the MCI stage (mean follow-up time 2.50 \u00b1 1.10 y). In the Cox regression model with stepwise forward variable selection entering the 5 identified plasma proteins as predictors, only ApoE was significant with lower concentrations in the progressive MCI group (hazard ratio 0.34; P = 0.01).\nThe correlation analysis revealed significant associations between the individual blood biomarkers, as well as between the blood and CSF markers. Significant results were found for correlations between A1M with BNP (r = 0.31, P < 0.001) and IL-16 (r = 0.24, P = 0.001), as well as BNP with SGOT (r = \u00c00.18, P = 0.02). Ab 1-42 was correlated with all of the tested blood biomarkers (A1M: r = \u00c00.23, P < 0.01; ApoE: r = 0.43, P < 0.001; BNP: r = \u00c0 0.21, P < 0.01; IL-16: r = 0.25, P = 0.001; SGOT: r = 0.26, P = 0.001). Furthermore, tTau was correlated with A1M (r = 0.29, P < 0.01) and IL-16 (r = \u00c00.25, P = 0.01), and pTau was correlated with A1M (r = 0.24, P < 0.01), ApoE (r = \u00c0 0.20, P = 0.01), BNP (r = 0.17, P = 0.03), and IL-16 (r = \u00c0 0.24, P < 0.01).\nTo further understand the biological relevance of the tested biomarkers for AD, the potential signaling pathway within the final 5 RBM analytes and APP as well as tau was explored using the computational gene network prediction tool Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. This analysis identified a regulatory network connecting 4 signaling genes related to 4 plasma proteins (A1M, ApoE, BNP, and IL-16) with APP and tau (Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links. lww.com/WAD/A46), which had a significant likelihood score of 17.\nRegarding the comparison of the present results with the findings of previous proteomic studies, 30 of 79 previously described plasma proteins were also available in ADNI; only ApoE was significant both in the present and in one previous report. 14 In addition, 11 of 17 plasma proteins with significant concentration differences between AD dementia and physiological aging in at least 2 previous studies could be tested in the present analysis. However, none of these 11 proteins contributed to the differentiation between the AD dementia and CON groups in the ADNI cohort (results not shown). "}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "A blood-based biomarker panel for the early identification of AD is highly desirable because of a number of considerations. The present study reports data from the ADNI including a set of 107 plasma analytes; we found a plasma proteomic signature of the early clinical stages of AD that offered a degree of diagnostic accuracy close to the established CSF biomarkers. However, the missing overlap with the results of previously published comparable studies dampens our enthusiasm.\nGiven that AD is a biologically complex neurodegenerative disease, which is unlikely to be caused by a single pathogenic event (or cascade of events), the finding of a panel of plasma biomarkers characterizing AD rather than a single marker was an expected result. 26 The present study addressed a central shortcoming of the available AD biomarkers, namely the need for less-invasive procedures for ascertainment. Ab 1-42 and tTau/pTau 181 in CSF are important components of the clinical diagnostic process of AD 27 ; however, none of them is exclusive for AD dementia. 1, [28] [29] [30] Another potential limitation of these established CSF markers is that they only mirror 2, albeit central, aspects of the multifactorial nature of AD. Therefore, a more comprehensive set of markers covering different aspects of the disease is likely to contribute relevant information that may improve diagnostic performance. In addition to these biological considerations, practical issues related to CSF sampling hinder the wider use of biomarkers in CSF. In the present study, a set of 5 plasma proteins was found that significantly differed between the early clinical stages of AD and physiological aging. A regulatory network analysis showed that 4 of these markers, A1M, ApoE, BNP, and IL-16 were closely linked to APP and tau signaling; this finding was also supported by the additional correlation analyses. ApoE shows strong genetic association with AD. 31 IL-16 is a chemoattractant for certain immune cells, and its upregulation has been observed in various cerebral pathologies 32, 33 including AD. 34 BNP is a circulating hormone that has been related to dementia, partly in conjunction with cardiovascular disease. 35 A1M is a ubiquitous plasma and tissue protein that acts as a heme scavenger and thereby protects against reactive oxidative stress, 36 potentially preventing Ab aggregation. 37 Biological functions related to this network include cellular death, lipid metabolism, and molecular transport, all functions that are involved in neurodegeneration and AD pathogenesis. 38 In addition to this regulatory network, SGOT was also found to be altered in AD in the present study. SGOT is a biomarker of peripheral inflammation such as in hepatitis, 39 muscle damage, 40 and myocardial infarction 41 ; SGOT is also an important enzyme in amino acid metabolism and a common clinical measure for liver function. 42 Altered enzyme activity of SGOT in AD prefrontal cortex has been reported before. 43 A previous study of our group suggested that SGOT levels in CSF might improve the diagnosis of AD dementia in combination with tau. 44 The relationship between AD and peripheral inflammation is not yet clear 45 and further research is warranted to elucidate this association. To sum up these considerations, the biomarker panel in our present study includes proteins in blood that seem to reflect the heterogenous pathomechanisms of AD.\nCompared with 2 previous analyses of the ADNI data set, 46, 47 using different statistical approaches from the one applied in the present study, an overlap between significant blood proteins was only found for ApoE, which was also significant in a number of other previous studies. In our present study, ApoE contributed both to the differentiation between AD dementia and physiological aging and to the prediction of cognitive decline in MCI. The lacking prediction of cognitive decline in MCI by the other markers may possibly be explained by changing protein concentrations with disease progression. ApoE is a small transport protein highly expressed in liver and brain. In brain, ApoE is well known as an amyloid chaperone protein associated with AD neuropathology. 48 It may have a role in preventing Ab oligomerization and amyloidogenesis, and ApoE protein concentration in blood correlates with brain amyloid burden in cognitively normal individuals. 26 However, reports on ApoE blood concentrations in AD dementia are conflicting, showing unchanged, 49 increased, 50 or decreased levels, 51,52 the latter being in line with our present findings. Decreased plasma ApoE levels may contribute to a disrupted cerebral lipid metabolism. In addition, lower peripheral ApoE levels may also reduce the efficiency of Ab peptide clearance. 48 It is important to note that, although APOE genotype is a well-established risk factor for AD, the association between the APOE variations and the blood ApoE protein levels is less clear. 53 The large number of discovery phase proteomic studies is in contrast to the limited number of validation studies, which highlights the challenges of replication. 54, 55 Problems may arise from different experimental designs and analytical methods, as well as heterogenous cohorts. 56 However, the diagnostic relevance of findings without replication is highly questionable. In the present work, the combination of 5 plasma proteins resulted in a reasonably good differentiation between patients with AD dementia and healthy control subjects, but 4 of these proteins had not been reported before. Furthermore, only ApoE was identified in one of 2 previous analyses of the ADNI data set using different statistical approaches. 47, 57 In summary, the present findings not only indicate that the blood proteome is a promising source for reliable AD biomarkers but also indicate that replicable findings are crucial.\nLimitations of our study include the lack of histopathologic confirmation of AD diagnoses; however, the validity of the clinical diagnoses at specialized centers has repeatedly been confirmed by autopsy series. 58 The ADNI cohort may not truly represent the whole population with AD, and future studies will have to show whether comprehensive biomarker panels are also able to distinguish between certain AD subtypes, for example, those with a relevant vascular or inflammatory component. Most importantly, future studies will need to replicate our findings and also to relate the plasma biomarker panel to core pathologic features of AD, such as magnetic resonance imaging hippocampal atrophy or in vivo amyloid burden using positron emission tomography. Even though a comprehensive set of blood proteins was selected according to a hypothesis-driven approach, other involved proteins might have been missed. The cross-validation approach used in our study is widely applied in discovery phase clinical proteomic studies. However, findings without replication in truly independent cohorts have to be handled carefully. Discrimination of patients and controls using the set of proteins identified in the present study is likely to be less accurate in independent cohorts.\nTo conclude, our study presents a further piece of evidence for the existence of a specific blood-based proteomic profile of AD, which may be of interest for diagnostic purposes. However, more research is urgently needed to identify reliable blood-based biomarkers, and our study also highlights the dire need for replication of discovery phase findings. Peripheral markers of disease identified in proteomic or genomic studies are influenced by a number of internal and external factors such as sex, 59 age, concomitant diseases, 60 and medications. 61 Future research will have to carefully adjust for these nuisance factors."}]
