[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "In December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), called coronavirus disease 2019 , believed to have originated in Wuhan, China, emerged and spread rapidly across more than 30 countries worldwide, resulting in a pandemic (World Health Organization, 2020b) . COVID-19 presents with several severe symptoms, such as fever over 37.5\u00b0C, dry cough, severe dyspnea, and pneumonia (Anderson and Reiter, 2020; Wang et al., 2020) . In addition, some patients have severe cardiovascular and permanent lung damage. COVID-19 is transmitted when droplets from an infected person penetrate the respiratory tract or mucous membrane of the eyes, nose, or mouth of another person. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30th January 2020, and, then, on 11th March 2020 COVID-19 was declared a \"pandemic\" (World Health Organization, 2020a) . has been widely transmitted in the community compared to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which emerged in 2003, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which emerged in 2012 (Zheng et al., 2020) . Genome sequence analysis demonstrated that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 belong to the beta-coronavirus genus (Chen et al., 2020c; Munster et al., 2020) . There are only 380 amino acid substitutions that distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-like coronaviruses. Twenty-seven of these substitution mutations have been observed in genes encoding viral spike protein (S), although most differences were found in non-structural protein-coding genes. The viral spike protein is essential for cell receptor binding, cell entry, and viral infection. Studies suggest that the lower pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 compared to that of SARS-CoV is correlated to differences their genomic sequences (Benvenuto et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020a) . The pathogenesis and structure of SARS-CoV-2 were also analyzed in several previous studies (Gao et al., 2020; Mousavizadeh and Ghasemi, 2020; ul Qamar et al., 2020) . However, research regarding molecular mechanisms and therapeutics is still required.\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNA, 20-22 nucleotides in length. The seed region in miRNAs, approximately six nucleotides long, recognizes and binds to the complementary binding site of the target mRNA 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) to regulate its expression. Numerous studies suggest that miRNAs play an important role in diverse biological processes, such as cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, oncogenesis, viral replication, and pathogenesis (Bartel, 2004; Cheng et al., 2005; Trobaugh and Klimstra, 2017; Zhang et al., 2007) . miRNAs regulate several diseases, such as cancers, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, by regulating the expression of target genes (Barwari et al., 2016; Cao et al., 2020; Chakraborty et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2020d; Liang and Li, 2020; Reddy, 2015) . Moreover, recent studies have identified the association of miRNAs with antiviral effects by targeting both the 3'UTR and coding region of the viral genome (Gambardella et al., 2020; Guterres et al., 2020; Ivashchenko et al., 2020; Song et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2012) . One study identified several miRNAs that interact with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes (Ivashchenko et al., 2020) . Another study suggested that the virulence of COVID-19 in elderly patients is correlated with the types and abundances of host cellular miRNAs (Fulzele et al., 2020) . Based on these previous studies (Hooykaas et al., 2016; Jopling et al., 2005; Trobaugh and Klimstra, 2017) , we analyzed miRNAs binding to the sequences of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we investigated miRNAs binding to receptor proteins, including ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), ADAM17 (ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17), and TMPRSS2 (type II transmembrane serine proteases), that are important for the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 into host cells. In this study, bioinformatic and evolutionary analyses of SARS-CoV-2 were performed, and the expression of miRNAs was also confirmed. Our findings suggest that specific miRNAs may potentially be diagnostic biomarkers for COVID-19 and present new therapeutic insights regarding COVID-19."}, {"section_title": "Ethical statement", "text": "Experiments with the Male golden Syrian hamsters were carried out in accordance with the guidelines and regulations approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Jeonbuk National University (No. CBNU 2020-56) ."}, {"section_title": "Cell culture and virus", "text": "African green monkey kidney clone E6 (Vero-E6) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, MEM non-essential amino acids, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 100 Units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Hyclone, USA).

These analyses could provide further understanding on correlation between relative miRNA expressions and virus infection. SARS-CoV-2 has a typical genomic structure, similar to those of other beta coronaviruses. Its genome contains 14 open reading frames (ORFs), encoding 27 proteins. ORF1 and ORF2 in the 50-terminal region of the SARS-CoV-2 genome encode 15 non-structural proteins crucial for virus replication (Malik et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020a) . SARS-CoV-2 consists of three structural proteins encoded by the 30-terminal region of the genome, the spike (S), envelope (E), and membrane (M) proteins, which form the viral envelope, and the nucleocapsid proteins, which includes the single-stranded RNA virus genome. Through genomic analysis, SARS-CoV-2 was found to have the same human membrane receptor as SARS-CoV, ACE2 (Wan et al., 2020) . The viral spike protein mediates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 by binding to ACE2 (Das et al., 2020) . ACE2, an ectoenzyme, is anchored to the plasma membrane of cells in the lower respiratory tract, heart, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract (Imai et al., 2010) . Host cell-receptor binding is facilitated via the viral spike protein, processed by the type II transmembrane serine protease, TMPRSS2. The processed spike protein interacts with the extracellular domain of ACE2, forming a complex that is subsequently internalized with the help of clathrin (Chen et al., 2020b; Gro\u00df et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2020) . ADAM17, a transmembrane proteinase, cleaves the extracellular juxta-membrane region of ACE2. The ectodomain is catalytically activated and then released into the extracellular milieu through a process referred to as \"shedding\" (Wang et al., 2008) . Some studies suggested that ACE2 shedding might be related to SARS-CoV entry into cells and replication (Haga et al., 2008; . One study suggested that ADAM17-dependent ACE2 shedding promotes lung pathogenesis by reducing the expression level of the ACE2, which is known to prevent lung injury associated with SARS-CoV infection (Heurich et al., 2014) . Our research found that the number of miRNAs that bind to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were different. The number of miRNA binding to SARS-CoV-2 genome was much more than to the other two viruses ( Table  1) . The difference of the binding number between the three viral genomes may suggest the possibility of the SARS-CoV-2 evolution, gaining its own specific traits over time. Infection of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is transmitted through unciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes, and then cause several symptoms such as fever, dry cough, respiratory failure, and severe complications including pneumonia and kidney failure (Ashour et al., 2020; Drosten et al., 2003; Li et al., 2003; Zaki et al., 2012) . In case of the SARS-CoV-2, it causes similar symptoms with the two viruses, but induces even severe cardiovascular damage and permanent lung damage (Anderson and Reiter, 2020; Chen et al., 2020a; Pedersen and Ho, 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020) .\nIn accordance with the analysis of receptor affinity, SARS-CoV-2 has higher binding affinity to ACE2 than the 2003 strain of SARS-CoV (Wan et al., 2020) . Compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has a higher infectiousness and a lower mortality rate, resulting in a rapid transmission rate. Genetic analyses using the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from infected patients demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 has 88% sequence similarity to bat SARSr-CoV, 79% similarity to SARS-CoV, and only 50% to MERS-CoV (Lu et al., 2020) . According to the WHO report, the reproductive number (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 is 2 to 2.5, higher than those of SARS-CoV (1.7-1.9) and MERS-CoV (< 1) (Chen, 2020; Wu et al., 2020b) . R0 indicates the average number of people who would catch the disease from one infected person in a population without previous disease records and represents the potential of disease spread (Delamater et al., 2019) . Consistent with a recent, large descriptive study, the mortality rate of COVID-19 (2.3%) is lower than that of SARS (9.5%) and MERS (34.4%) (Chen, 2020; Munster et al., 2020; Epidemiology Working Group for NCIP Epidemic Response and Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020) . These studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has more evolutionary suitable traits to infection compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Our bioinformatic study identified there were much more miRNA binding sites in SARS-CoV-2 genome than other two viruses. We assumed that increasing of binding sites in viral genome could contribute to enhanced evolutionary traits through more sophisticated epigenetic controls.\nMany studies have shown that miRNAs have a strong relationship with the pathogens (Abdel-Mohsen et al., 2014; Aqeilan et al., 2010; Pineau et al., 2010; Small et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2018) . In case of the viral infection, miRNAs could response in two conflicting ways; As an assistant of the virus to avoid host immune responses or as a protector of the host to fight against the virus. These regulations were may accomplished by directly bind to the viral genome or because of the gene regulation targeted by miRNAs (Ho et al., 2016; Piedade and Azevedo-Pereira, 2016; Scheel et al., 2016; Trobaugh and Klimstra, 2017) . From the bioinformatic analysis in our study, 13 miRNAs were chosen as candidate key regulators of SARS-CoV-2 infection. As a result, five miRNAs, hsa-miR-15b-5p, hsa-miR-195-5p, hsa-miR-221-3p, hsa-miR-140-3p, and hsa-miR-422a , showed significant differences in expression against to SARS-CoV-2 infection. hsa-miR-15b-5p and hsa-miR-195-5p are members of the miR-15 family, which have the similar binding regions for target sites. The miR-15 family is known to regulate cell proliferation by targeting cell cycle proteins, such as cyclin D3 (CCND3), cyclin E1 (CCNE1), and CDK6 (Linsley et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2008) . Furthermore, miR-15 family regulates apoptosis by targeting antiapoptotic gene Bcl-2 (Aqeilan et al., 2010; Bandi et al., 2009) . One study demonstrated that the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis is controlled by hsa-miR-15b-5p which targets extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) in rat PC12 cells. ERK1 is an essential component of the MAP kinase signaling pathway and regulates various cellular processes. Down-regulated ERK1 suppresses cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis (Luo et al., 2017; Wortzel and Seger, 2011; Zeng et al., 2005) . hsa-miR-195-5p is well studied in cardiovascular diseases. In accordance with research regarding hsa-miR-195-5p expression during cardiac hypertrophy, hsa-miR-195-5p is up-regulated, potentially leading to fatal dilated cardiomyopathy because of the down regulation of the anti-apoptotic factor, Bcl-2 (Small et al., 2010) . In our study, the expression of hsa-miR-15b-5p was down-regulated and that of hsa-miR-195-5p was the up-regulated after SARS-CoV-2 infection. According to the above-mentioned studies, down regulation of hsa-miR-15b-5p may enable SARS-CoV-2 to escape the host immune defense by inhibiting apoptosis and promote the proliferation of infected cells. On the contrary, up-regulated hsa-miR-195-5p promotes apoptosis by inducing cell cycle arrest and prevents excessive proliferation of the infected cells as the host immune response.\nThe expression of hsa-miR-221-3p and hsa-miR-140-3p was also confirmed in both normal and infected samples, as miRNAs that bind to ADAM17 and TMPRSS2, respectively, which are important to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In one study, the expression of the hsa-miR-221-3p during the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was analyzed. TANK Binding Kinase 1 (TBK1), the target gene of the hsa-miR-221-3p, encodes an important protein involved in interferon production and virus clearance (Pineau et al., 2010; Zhao, 2013) . At the initial stage of the HBV infection, known as the immune-tolerant phase, hsa-miR-221-3p is highly expressed. Thereafter, down regulation of TBK1 suppresses the innate immune response and promotes viral persistence by permitting HBV replication (Singh et al., 2018) . Based on this previous research, elevated hsa-miR-221-3p could be said to suppress the innate immune system and facilitate virus replication in the SARS-CoV-2 infected sample via similar molecular mechanisms as in HBV infection. Moreover, hsa-miR-140-3p is related to the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis by targeting the Bcl-2 gene, similarly to other members of the miR-15 family. A previous study revealed that decreased expression of hsa-miR140-3p and increased cell proliferation were observed in artery smooth muscle cells isolated from peripheral artery disease arteries (Zhu et al., 2018) . In our study, the down regulation of hsa-miR-140-3p may have supported virus infection by inhibiting apoptosis and promoting cell proliferation.\nWe also conducted expression analysis of the miRNAs derived from transposable elements (TE), which have the ability to move around the host genome and are involved in many biological processes (Casacuberta and Gonz\u00e1lez, 2013; McCue et al., 2012; Slotkin and Martienssen, 2007) . Moreover, TEs could generate new factors, and one of these factors is non-coding RNAs, including miRNAs (Piriyapongsa et al., 2007; Roberts et al., 2013; Smalheiser and Torvik, 2005) . Research regarding hsa-miR-307, derived from the long terminal repeat element of an endogenous retrovirus in olive flounder, provided insight about the enhancer activity of the miRNA (Lee et al., 2019) . miRNAs derived from TEs also have a strong relationship with human diseases (Jin and Lee, 2016; Lee et al., 2020; Murakami et al., 2006; Pinto et al., 2018) ; for instance, hsa-miR-422a is significantly down-regulated after IFN-\u03b1/ribavirin treatment in patients infected with HIV-1 (Abdel- Mohsen et al., 2014) . The study suggested that hsa-miR-422a targets genes associated with p53-dependent apoptosis, such as MLH1 and TP53 (Abdel-Mohsen et al., 2014; Yanamadala and Ljungman, 2003; Zhang et al., 1999) . We observed that hsa-miR-422a was down-regulated in the SARS-CoV-2-infected sample; thus, it could be assumed that hsa-miR-422a promotes the apoptosis of infected cells by in-ducing the host immune response. In conclusion, we suggest that multiple miRNAs are involved in the regulation of the human immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Above all, hsa-miR-15b-5p and hsa-miR-195-5p showed the most distinctive expression patterns compared to other miRNAs. This study suggests that specific miRNAs which directly bind to the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including hsa-miR-15b-5p and hsa-miR-195-5p could have important function in SARS-CoV-2 infection."}, {"section_title": "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS", "text": "W.R.K. and E.G.P. designed and performed all the experiments and wrote the manuscript, K.W.K., S.M.L., and B.K. provided the hamster samples, and H.S.K. commented on and revised the manuscript.
