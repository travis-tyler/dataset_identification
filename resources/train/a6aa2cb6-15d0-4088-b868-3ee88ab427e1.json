After the development of techni(ues to measure serum insulin (2) , the ability to study the possible role of gut hormones in controlling insulin secretion was greatly increased. In 1964 McIntyre et al. reported that the insulin response to oral glucose was greater than to glucose given intravenously (3) . This was confirmed by Perley and Kipnis (4) among others, and further studies suggested that this effect was produced by gastrointestinal hormone(s) (5, 6) . Although many studies have been conducted on the specific identity of such a hormonal mediator, the issue has remained open to investigation (7) . Recently, the isolation of gastric inhibitory\nThe Journal of Clinical Investigation Volume 62 July 1978 152-161 polypeptide (GIP)1 by Brown et al. (8) and the demonstration that infusion of this peptide augments glucosestimulated insulin release without itself being an insulin secretagogue (9) has raised speculation that this may be the gastrointestinal mediator of insulin release. In addition, increases in circulating levels of GIP after the ingestion of nutrients associated with insulin release, notably glucose (10) (11) (12) (13) and fat (14, 15) , provide further evidence for the association of GIP with insulin release.\nIn this study the glucose clamp technique (16, 17) has been adapted to determine the response of immunoreactive GIP (IR-GIP) to oral glucose, the effect of circulating glucose and insulin levels on GIP secretion, and the response of elevated GIP levels on insulin production. In essence, this technique allows the separation of the effects of circulating IR-GIP and of glucose levels on insulin secretion. Endogenous GIP secretion was stimulated by an oral glucose load under the following conditions: (a) after the establishment of steady-state hyperglycemia by the servo-controlled intravenous infusion of a glucose solution and (b) after the establishment of a hyperinsulinized state with the maintenance of euglycemia by a fixed insulin infusion and a servo-controlled glucose infusion. In both cases the ingestion of glucose was not permitted to change the established glycemic state but did result in secretion of GIP. Both the change in circulating level of GIP and its effect on insulin secretion can then be assessed in the absence of changes in the blood glucose level. Plasma IR-GIP and insulin (IRI) were measured during these conditions, and comparisons were made before and after the ingestion of a standard oral glucose dose."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Patient selection and preparation", "text": "78 studies were made on 77 ambulatory, healthy male volunteers. 54 subjects were community dwelling participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging.

Basically, conditions were created that required the infusion of a relatively large amount of glucose intravenously. Thus, when glucose is ingested, the desired blood glucose level can be maintained by appropriate reduction in the intravenous glucose infusion to compensate for the glucose absorbed via the gastrointestinal tract.\nIn all types of experiments the following procedure was used. An antecubital intravenous polyethylene catheter was inserted for infusion of glucose with or without insulin as described below. A second polyethylene catheter was inserted retrogradely into a dorsal hand or wrist vein, and the hand was enclosed in an insulated, grounded chamber warmed to 68\u00b0C to \"arterialize\" the venous blood obtained for all samples (19) . After allowing temperature equilibration, at least three control blood samples were obtained at 10-min intervals and immediately assayed for blood glucose.\nHeparinized blood samples were quickly centrifuged at 4\u00b0C; aliquot samples were frozen for subsequent insulin and GIP assay. In all experiments, samples for blood glucose, plasma IR-GIP, and plasma 1IR, were obtained every 2 min for 10 min, and then every 5 min for the duration of the study (2 h). The blood glucose was maintained at the preselected value for 120 min by a servocontrolled negative feedback system coupled to a variable speed infusion pump (Harvard Apparatus Co., Millis, Mass.) delivering a 20% glucose solution.\nHYPERGLYCEMIC STUDIES (n = 52) At 0 min, a logarithmically falling, priming inf'usion of' glucose was administered over a 12-min period to raise the blood glucose rapidly to a level of' 125 mg/dl above basal.\nStudies with oral glucose.

Fig. 1 shows the blood glucose, plasma insulin, plasma GIP, and glucose infusion curves in the 24 subjects who received hyperglycemic clamps with oral glucose at 1 h. Plasma IRI rose from a basal value of 7.9\u00b10.7 (mean\u00b1SEM) to a peak of 54.1\u00b13.9 AU/ml at 4 min in response to the hyperglycemia. After its fall to a nadir of 31.1\u00b12. 4 ,uU/ml at 20 min, the IRI rose steadily; the mean value for the 30-60-min period was 40.6\u00b13.1 uU/ml. After oral glucose at 60 min, the mean plasma IRI curve began to rise at 70 min, was clearly elevated at 75 min, and peaked at 170.5\u00b114.6 ,U/ml at 105 min. The mean plasma IRI for the 90-120-min period was 165.9\u00b1 12.5 ,uU/ml.\nThe anticipated 90-120-min IRI concentration, had oral glucose not been given, can be computed in these subjects from data obtained in a series of 28 hyperglycemic clamp studies in which oral glucose was not given. From these data, the relation between the 30-60-min and the 90-120-min IRI was computed:\nIRI9-120 = 11 + 1.40 (IR130_60). The coefficient of correlation (r) is 0.908. The coefficient of variation of the predicted 90-120-min value is 17.4%.\nThe mean predicted 90-120-min value for the 24 subjects is 67.2\u00b14.3 ,uU/ml. The mean difference between the predicted values and the actual IRI values achieved in the 24 subjects on the hyperglycemia + oral glucose protocol is 98.6\u00b110.1 ,uU/ml (P <0.001). Each of the 24 subjects had a higher 90-120-min IRI than predicted, the range being 6-216 ,U/ml. The ratio of actual to predicted insulin levels at 90-120 min is 2.50\u00b10. 16. After the initial priming infusion of glucose, the infusion rate remained quite constant from 12 to 60 min. Note that despite the glucose ingestion at 60 min, it was still necessary, on the average, to maintain the glucose infusion essentially unchanged for the next 30 min (from 60 to 90 min). In some subjects the glucose infusion had to be sharply reduced to compensate for the glucose influx from the gut; in others, the need for infused glucose actually increased in the 60-90-min period in response to the rise in insulin. After 90 min, the mean glucose infusion rate rose so that by the end of the 2-h infusion, the rate essentially doubled.\nThe mean basal plasma IR-GIP level was 305\u00b134 pg/ml. The basal GIP values reported in the literature are very variable. Mean values range from 85 to 410 pg/ml (10, 12, 13, (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) in normal subjects. Assay differences as well as differences in the populations sampled undoubtedly contribute to this variance.\nBasal IR-GIP levels did not change significantly during the intravenous glucose infusion (Table I) the 24 subjects did not differ significantly from the basal values, there was considerable fluctuation in the measured GIP values during these times in individual subjects. The magnitude of this variance can be appreciated from the CV of the 30-60-min GIP levels. The CV ranged from 0 to 82% and averaged 39+20% (SD). Thus, in an individual subject, it may not be possible to detect the exact moment of increase in GIP after glucose ingestion at 60 min. But one can have great confidence in the results from the entire group (Fig. 1) . Similar to the mean plasma insulin response, mean plasma IR-GIP began to rise at 70 min and was clearly elevated at 75 min. The highest mean GIP value occurred at 100 min, 752-+105 pg/ml. The range of the peak level (regardless of time) was 400-2,300 pg/ml, with a mean of 1,094+109 pg/ml. Each subject showed a higher mean GIP value at 90-120 min than at 0-60 min; the increases ranged from 56 to 1,130 pg/ml, with a mean of 392+60 pg/ml (P < 0.001).\nIt can be seen from the figure that the time course of the elevation in IR-GIP after oral glucose is nearly identical with the time course of the augmented insulin response after 60 min. We have also examined the relation between the plasma IR-GIP and IRI curves in the 24 individual subjects. Because of the fluctuations in IR-GIP levels as noted above, it is difficult to delineate with precision the time of the earliest increase in its concentration. Still, in 16 of the 24 subjects, the first detectable increases in both hormones occurred within +5 min of each other and in 22 of the 24 within +10 min. In the other two subjects, IR-GIP levels were below the assay detection limit during the 30-60-min time period so that increases in IR-GIP could have occurred well before we could detect it. These are the only two subjects who showed IRI increases well before IR-GIP levels could be detected. It is important that in none of the 24 subjects did IR-GIP levels begin to rise more than 10 min before IRI levels increased. Insulin infusion studies with euglycemia (n = 11). These studies were designed to examine the role of the prevailing blood glucose level on the insulinotropic effect of IR-GIP. Figs. 2 and 3 illustrate the results of five euglycemic clamp studies performed without oral glucose, and six studies in which glucose was ingested at 60 min. The exogenous insulin infusion in both groups resulted in plasma IRI elevations to nearly 400 AU/ml within 10 min, with a stable plateau of -300 ,U/ml reached by 30 min. The glucose infusion required to maintain euglycemia increased rapidly and approached a plateau by 60 min in those studies performed without oral glucose. In the six subjects who ingested glucose at 60 min, a sharp reduction in the intravenous glucose infusion was necessary to maintain euglycemia in the 2nd h, i.e., during glucose absorption (Fig. 2) . Plasma IR-GIP ( Fig. 3 and Table I significantly after oral glucose. The increases ranged from 133 to 1,255 pg/ml (90-120 minus 0-60 min); the mean increase was 678+181 pg/ml (P <0.02) under these conditions of euglycemia and hyperinsulinemia.\nInsulin infusion studies with hyperglycemia (n = 15).\nTo determine whether endogenous insulin release could be evoked by endogenous GIP during an exogenous insulin infusion, the blood glucose concentration was allowed to increase gradually after 60 min.

Of the seven subjects whose plateau glucose concentration after oral glucose ranged from 22 to 61 mg/dl above basal, the 90-120-min IRI values were considerably higher than the 30-60-min value in five of the subjects and averaged 74 \u00b1 19.2 ,uU/ml higher for the entire group of seven (P < 0.01). However, the 90-120-min IRI values in three subjects without glucose ingestion with plateaus of 27, 29, and 45 mg/dl above basal averaged only 24\u00b112.6 ,uU/ml above the 30-60-min value. To define further the threshold value of blood glucose at which GIP becomes an effective insulin secretagogue, five experiments were performed in which the plateau glucose concentration after oral glucose ranged from 9 to 18 mg/dl above the baseline. In this group, the 90-120-min IRI values averaged 23\u00b18. 4 ,U/ml greater than the mean values at 30-60 min; this value is not significantly different from the increase in insulin which occurred at 90-120 min in the five euglycemic studies in which oral glucose was not given (9\u00b19 ,U/ml) or in the six euglycemic subjects who did receive oral glucose (17\u00b16 ,uU/ml).\nGIP responses (Table 1 , Group C) were assayed in 10 of the 12 subjects who were given an insulin infusion for 2 h; this group received oral glucose at 1 h and hyperglycemia occurred during the 2nd h (see Methods). The mean basal value was the same as that of the six insulin infusion studies in which euglycemia was maintained. The GIP response to oral glucose was somewhat greater in the 10 subjects in whom mild or moderate hyperglycemia occurred, but this difference was not statistically significant.\nAll insulin infusion studies are summarized in Fig. 4 . The shaded area represents the insulin range (mean+2 SD) of those studies (n = 8, closed symbols) in which oral glucose was not administered. It can be seen that below a blood glucose elevation of 20 mg/dl above the basal level, insulin levels were not significantly augmented by GIP after oral glucose (n = 11, open symbols). When the blood glucose concentration was elevated by more than 20 mg/dl above basal, five of the seven subjects who received oral glucose (open circles) showed a plasma insulin increase."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "The search for the hormonal mediator of the socalled enteroinsular axis has long been the subject of investigation. In 1932, LaBarre (28) suggested that the name \"incretin\" be applied to that enteric hormone which augments glucose-stimulated insulin release. Although the investigation of the established gastrointestinal hormones cholecystokinin-pancreozymin, gastrin, and secretin, as well as other candidates has at times yielded suggestive support of their involvement (29) (30) (31) (32) , the identity of a single responsible hormone has remained unsettled. Physiological (endog-enous) release of the previously established hormones has not been clearly shown to be adequate to produce circulating levels at which insulin release can be demonstrated. Furthermore, when infused in amounts that do not exceed physiologic levels, they have not been shown to be insulinotropic.\nRecently, evidence has begun to appear which suggests that the 43 amino acid polypeptide, GIP, may be the enteric mediator in the enteroinsular axis. GIP has been isolated from the small bowel and the gastric antrum (33) , has been found in the duodenum and jejunum in highest concentration (22) , and has been localized to a specific small intestinal cell type (34) . Its release has been shown to be stimulated by oral glucose (10), oral fat (14) , and by a mixed meal (21) . Furthermore, infusion of purified GIP within a physiologic dose range has been shown to stimulate insulin release when administered with a concomitant infusion of glucose (9) .\nThe present study confirms that oral glucose results in prompt and significant elevations in IR-GIP. The experimental protocols used in this study examine the effect of oral glucose administration on plasma GIP levels under three conditions (Table I) : (A) in the presence of marked hyperglycemia and moderate endogenously-produced hyperinsulinemia; (B) in the presence of marked exogenously-produced hyperinsulinemia and euglycemia; and (C) in the presence of marked (exogenous) hyperinsulinemia and mild or moderate hyperglycemia. We cannot examine the effect of oral glucose on plasma GIP and still maintain both basal glucose and basal insulin levels. The lowest GIP responses occurred in condition (A) and the highest responses occurred in condition (C). The GIP responses, judged either by the 90-120-min levels or by the increment in the 90-120-min level over the 0-60-min level, are statistically significantly greater in condition (C) than (A), but (C) does not differ significantly from (B), nor does (B) differ significantly from (A). We cannot say from these studies alone whether marked hyperglycemia inhibits or marked hyperinsulinemia stimulates the gut cell response to oral glucose, but it is clear that hyperinsulinemia does not inhibit the response.\nOther studies have shown that experimental situations that cause elevation of both serum glucose and insulin tend to depress the response of the gut cell to oral fat or to a mixed meal (23, 24, 35, 36) . In two of the studies, the gut cell response to oral fat was studied in the presence and in the absence of an intravenous glucose infusion (23, 24) ; GIP concentrations were lower after IV glucose and its concomitant hyperinsulinemia in both studies.\nIn a third study (35) , an intravenous bolus of insulin also diminished the gut cell response to triglyceride, but the altered GIP response did not occur until the serum insulin concentration had returned to its basal value at which time hypoglycemia and hyperglucagonemia were present. In the fourth study (36) , a mixed test meal was administered to pancreatitis patients. The patients were divided into three groups on the basis of their insulin responses to the meal. The serum glucose levels varied inversely with the insulin responses. The group with intermediate insulin and glucose responses had a significantly greater GIP response than those with the lowest and the highest insulin and glucose responses. Our own results, in which the stimulus to GIP release was oral glucose rather than oral triglyceride or a mixed meal, show the lowest GIP response in the situation with marked hyperglycemia and only moderate hyperinsulinemia (Table I, [A] ). There have been no studies reported in which, when oral glucose is the stimulus to the gut cell, hyperinsulinemia has been shown to have a suppressive effect on GIP release.\nThe time course of the rise in plasma insulin after oral glucose during constant hyperglycemia is seen to follow the time course of the rise in IR-GIP almost identically (Fig. 1) . This time course can also be seen in Fig. 5 which may be considered as a dose-response curve. If the association of IR-GIP and IRI from 60 to 120 min is assumed to be a simple linear one, then the coefficient of correlation is computed to be 0.979. However, the curve appears to have the characteristics of a sigmoid relationship; further studies are required to define the association more definitively. The finding that the insulinotropic effect of ingested gltucose is absent during euglycemia is particularly intriguing in light of previous observations that fat ingestion, a potent stimuilus to GIP release (14) , is accompanied by either no insulin release (24, 37) or by a very small increase of about 4 AU/ml (15, 23, (38) (39) (40) , unless hyperglycemia is present. On the other hand, an insulinotropic effect of GIP independent of hyperglycemia has been reported in the dog (41) . However, the dose of GIP infused in this study produced serum GIP levels of -2,500-15,000 pg/ml. The demonstration of the requirement for glucose infusion for exogenous GIP to be insulinotropic in man (9) and the in vitro findings of the lack of an insulinotropic effect at low glucose concentrations in an isolated islet preparation (42) and isolated perfused pancreas (43) complement findings of the cturrent study in man, namely that endogenous GIP does not augment instulin release unless blood glucose levels are elevated by at least 20 mg/dl. Teleologically, such a threshold mechanism would appear appropriate to prevent the release of a potentially harmful quantity of insulin at a time when insufficient substrate concentration is present.\nThese studies do not rule out the possibility that one or more other as yet unidentified gastrointestinal hormones play a role in the mediation of the gastrointestinal phase of insulin secretion after glucose ingestion or that autonomic nervous system influences may contribute to this effect. The glucose clamp studies do show that in intact man there is a link between serum-endogenous GIP and insulin levels that is consistent with a growing literature in which other types of preparations and experimental protocols have been employed. That GIP is, at a minimum, a major component among the physiological stimuli to insulin secretion now appears to be definite."}]
