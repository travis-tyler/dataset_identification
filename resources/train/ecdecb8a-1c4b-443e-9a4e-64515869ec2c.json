[{"section_title": "", "text": "These changes in production technology have had farm-level impacts on resource allocation and the availability of farm operators for off-farm labor. Biotechnology, in a low commodity price scenario, was perceived to be a cost-reducing, yield-increasing measure by farmers, thus improving the financial performance of farmers (Fernandez-Cornejo, Dabercow and McBride, 2000). The rapid adoption of GM corn is seen as evidence of the perceived benefits of the technology outweighing the additional costs incurred. One externality resulting from the adoption of this new production technology in corn that has been largely ignored is the change in the availability of farm labor for other uses. The adoption of technology has been shown to increase farm efficiency (Goodwin & Mishra, 2004). The authors suggest that increased farm efficiency decreases the amount of hours spent off the farm. The phenomenon of diversification of income sources for farm households created by working off the farm has been observed in both developed and developing countries (Mishra, Morehart, El-Osta, Johnson and Hopkins, 2002;Chang and Mishra, 2008). Extensive literature has evolved that investigates the involvement of farm households in nonfarm labor markets. Mishra and Goodwin (1997) noted the importance of off-farm employment as a means of decreasing financial risks. Lamb (1996) observed that the decision of farm households to use an off-farm labor supply to mitigate the effects of production shocks leads to more efficient production choices (use of fertilizers) on the part of farmers. Fernandez-Cornejo, Chad and Mishra, (2005), studied the causal effects of farm households adopting new technologies on increased income through off-farm labor."}, {"section_title": "Literature Review", "text": "An abundance of literature has evolved to investigate the determinants of farm labor involvement in non-farm labor markets in the U.S. Yang (1997) studied the returns to education and the spillover effects of knowledge contributing to farming while participating in off-farm employment. Yang's research indicated that higher household schooling contributed to increased farm allocative efficiency and increased off-farm labor wages. Huffman (1980) considered education and agricultural research and extension as variables representing human capital which have efficiency effects on farm production, while changing the time allocated to farming. The changes in types of government payments (direct and indirect) since 1996 and their effects on off-farm labor supply have been studied in various papers. Ahearn, El-Osta and Dewbre (2006) provided evidence suggesting that policy changes with regards to payments since the 1996 FAIR act have not affected the availability of off-farm labor and that these payments increased the opportunity cost of price of leisure. They concluded that payments, irrespective of their nature, have a negative impact on the off-farm labor supply. The paper also showed evidence from Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) data that suggested that cash grain operations received payments and their operators were less likely to work off the farm. Various other studies have considered the effects of demographic factors on the availability of off-farm labor including age, household size, experience, and size of farms (Lass, Findeis & Hallberg, 1991;Huffman, 1980;Goodwin and Mishra, 2004;and Sumner, 1982). Numerous studies have analyzed the environmental, agronomic, and economic effects of adopting GM corn. Fernandez-Cornejo et al. (2001) studied the effects of GE corn and factors influencing its adoption; Fernandez-Cornejo and McBride (2000) suggested that adoption was highly correlated to net returns and change in yields of corn. Fernandez-Cornejo and Ingram (1998) estimated the effects of herbicide-tolerant corn adoption on yields, profits and herbicide use and concluded that lower herbicide use was significantly related to the adoption of new corn varieties. Marra, Pannell and Ghadim (2003) confirmed earlier studies that GM corn significantly decreased pesticide use while significantly increasing the net returns and average yields. This paper addresses two major objectives. First, it investigates the determinants of adoption of GM corn and second, it identifies the relationship between the number of hours worked off the farm and the adoption of new technology, specifically the share of acres planted of GM corn. An important component of our modeling method includes developing a two-stage left censored Tobit model, unlike a single Tobit equation, accounting for the endogeneity of the share of acres of GM corn planted in the U.S. Furthermore, the study tests for endogeneity using the Smith and Blundell (1986) test by testing for exogeneity of the share of GM acres planted in the off-farm labor equation. To better understand the intensity of the effect of adoption of the acres allocated to GM corn, this paper investigates the impact of this adoption on the number of hours worked off the farm for farmers who have already adopted and those who switched to these new varieties of corn using the McDonald and Moffitt (1980) decomposition."}, {"section_title": "Economic Model", "text": "The theoretical model is based on the labor supply model of low-income households developed by Snow et al. while modifying it for off-farm availability of agricultural labor and allowing for technology adoption. The farmer maximizes his utility based on consumption C, the decision of whether to incorporate technologies p (p=1 to accept new technologies), the human capital h, and other factors (including household characteristics). (1) Farmers maximize utility subject to constraints (2) C I S W = + + (Income Constraint), which requires that the consumption expenditure C equals the sum of farm income I, subsidies S, and off-farm income W. In this case,  Where X represent the quantity of farm inputs, F represents the quantity of on farm work, R is a vector of all other exogenous variables, and H is the human capital. Where L is the time allocated for leisure (Fernandez-Cornejo et al.), Off-farm wage W can be represented as Where K is the market value of on farm labor, T is the transportation costs, and w is the wage rate. Combining 2 through 6, we can write the income constraint as is the consumer's off-farm labor income conditional to the adoption of new technology. The decision to adopt GM corn is dictated by comparing the utilities between adopting and otherwise. Thus, let the indirect utility be defined as defining p* as the difference between the utility due to adopting the GM corn, Thus, the farmer chooses to adopt the new GM corn when the p* is positive. Thus, supply of off-farm labor H conditional to the adoption of GM corn is given by Hence, the model yields two-stage dependent off-farm labor supply equations, one pertaining to the farmers who choose to grow GM corn (p=1) and the other pertaining to farmers who do not adopt GM corn (p=0), while adoption p depends on other factors (equation 10)."}, {"section_title": "Econometric Model", "text": "The off-farm labor supply for farmers using GM corn and for those who do not plant GM corn are estimated. The labor supply and GM corn are treated as left-censored variables in our empirical specification. The resulting system is a simultaneous equation Tobit model of off-farm labor supply and adoption of GM corn. Because the censoring precludes unique or sensible solutions for the reduced forms, a condition must be imposed in a system of censored dependent variables (Heckman, 2001). The structural form of the model is given by where * y 2 is the off-farm labor supply, X 2 is a vector of exogenous variables determining * y 2 , * y 1 is the adoption of GM corn, X 1 is a vector of exogenous variables determining * y 1 , \u03b4 1 and \u03b4 2 are the vectors of parameters associated with the variables X 1 and X 2, \u03b2 1 and \u03b2 2 are scalar parameters, and \u03b5 1 and \u03b5 2 are distributed as bivariate normal random variables with correlation \u03c1. The random variables y 2 off-farm labor supply, and y 1 , adoption of GM corn, are thus the observed realizations of their latent counterparts, * y 2 and * y 1 (Amemiya, 1974). They are left censored at zero such that (14) y 1 = * y 1 if * y 1 > 0 and y 1 = 0 (Baum, 1999) and similarly for y 2. One can conclude that the model from equations 12 and 13 implies that the off-farm labor supply and adoption of GM corn are simultaneously determined. To avoid transmission of a possible misspecification of the equation determining off-farm labor, we use the two-stage estimation as proposed by Newey (1987). The model defined is estimated in two stages. In the first stage, equation 13 is estimated by Tobit. The reduced form coefficient estimates are then used to create an instrument, * y 1 , which is asymptotically uncorrelated with the error term in equation 12 (Greene) Under the alternative hypothesis, the suspected endogenous variables are expressed as linear projections of a set of instruments, and the residuals from the firststage regressions are added to the model. MacDonald and Moffitt (1980) proposed the use of the decomposition of the marginals in Tobit models to determine the changes in the probability of being above the limit and changes in the value of the dependent variable if it is already above the limit. We use this decomposition to understand the effects of changes in the second stage dependent variable (hours of off-farm work) due to the independent variables. To understand the effects of the independent coefficient on the dependent variable (in our case the time spent off the farm), the expectation of this y* (the unobserved latent variable) can be expressed as implying that the total change in the unconditional expected value of hours worked off the farm is decomposed into two intuitive parts. a) The change in the expected value of hours worked off the farm (y*) of those above zero, weighted by the probability of being above zero b) The change in the probability of being above zero, weighted by the conditional expected value of y* (McDonald & Moffitt, 1980). Considerable literature has evolved in the use of the simultaneous equation limited dependent variable model. Amemiya (1974) considers a model in which all endogenous variables are truncated to zero, revealing certain necessary restrictions on the model and suggesting a method of estimation using the indirect least squares method. Nelson and Olson (1978) proposed a two-stage least squares procedure for Tobit analysis proving that the estimates are asymptotically normal. More recent studies have applied these models for specifying effects on adoption of technologies including Blundell and Smith (1989) who compared estimates of marginal and marginal and new conditional maximum likelihood procedures. Goodwin and Mishra (2004) used the simultaneous equation framework to determine multiple job holdings and resulting effects on farming efficiency. McDonald and Moffitt (1980) suggested that decomposition of the marginal effects provided more substantive economic and policy implications. While many studies have considered the importance of off-farm labor and net income gains due to technology adoption, the off-farm labor supply changes that have resulted from these new technologies has hardly been explored. Smith (2002) notes that GM crops are management-saving and affect the off-farm labor supply, mainly due to the wage differential. The model developed in this paper considers the adoption of GM corn and the supply of off-farm labor jointly. Following MacDonald and Moffitt (1980), we decompose the total effect of a change in the dependent variable for those farmers who work off-farm, weighted by the probability of being farmers who work off-farm and the change in the probability of farmers who work off the farm weighted by the expected value of the dependent variable. Variables Table 2 provides a description of the variables and their mean values. For a better understanding, we discuss some of the explanatory variables in detail. The risk aversion (RISKAVERSION) measure is the ratio of crop insurance payment to the total farm operating expenditures as defined by Goodwin and Mishra (2004). We hypothesize that risk-averse farmers would adopt new proven technologies that increase productivity while guaranteeing a higher yield and therefore be positively correlated with a higher share of GM (SHGMACRES) acres on their farms. Higher costs of adoption may lead these risk-averse farmers to spend fewer hours off the farm (H_OFFOP) to protect their investments; hence, they may be more likely to work off the farm. Farmers who are partowners (POWNER) and lease more land (TENANT) tend to adopt new technologies that provide higher yield and, therefore, would show a positive relation to the share of GM acres planted. Government payments were disaggregated into three groups based on the type of payments: direct payments (decoupled, DIRECT), indirect payments (INDIRECT), and CRP payments (CRPPAYMENT). El-Osta, Mishra and Ahearn, (2005), suggest that since direct payments have only wealth effects while indirect and CRP payments have both wealth and substitution effects, there may be differences in the effect of these payments on off-farm labor considerations by farmers. Because the effects of direct payments may be different from other types of subsidy payments, we try to capture these effects in our off-farm labor supply model. Chang et al. (2008) suggest that CRP payments could affect savings, consumption, and income differently for different households based on their income and consumption distribution. Irrespective of any kind of payment, we expect that they have a significant negative impact on the number of hours worked off the farm. To better understand the intensity with which these payments affect the number of hours worked off the farm, we divide them into three categories as discussed above. Cash grain payments (CG) would positively affect the share of GM acres planted by the farmer. The cropping efficiency (CROP_EFF) factor was calculated as the ratio of gross cash farm income to total variable costs. Goodwin and Mishra (2004) suggest that the adoption of new technologies tends to increase cropping efficiency and, therefore, these two factors are positively correlated. Since corn is largely grown in the heartland and northern-crescent regions (as defined by ERS), we expect to see a significant positive impact on the share of acres planted under GM corn for these areas. The ARMS solicits education information by asking individuals to indicate which category (e.g., less than high school, high school, college, and graduate school) represents their educational achievement. We impute the years of education from these responses, assigning a level of education for each of the qualitative category (e.g., less than high school = 10 years; four-year college degree = 16 years). Literature (Lass, et. al., 1991;Fernandez-Cornejo et.al., 2005) suggests that, while age plays an important role in both adoption of new technologies (positively correlated) and the number of hours spent working off the farm (positively correlated), it tends to show a decline over longer periods of time. We capture the effect by adding the age-squared variable, which provides an intuitive way of calculating the age at which farmers tend to adopt fewer new technologies and also work off the farm. The off-farm work experience of the farm operator was believed to have an impact on the decision to work off the farm. Farmers with certain off-farm labor experience may show a higher tendency to work off the farm. Farmers with a higher household net worth would tend to allocate more time to leisure (Dewbre and Mishra, 2007), which would negatively affect the number of hours they work off the farm. The share of income from farming would have a negative effect on the hours spent off the farm by a farm operator."}, {"section_title": "The Data", "text": "The model is estimated using data obtained from the nationwide Agricultural ARMS uses a multi-phase sampling design and allows each sampled farm to represent a number of farms that are similar in the population, the number of which being the survey expansion factor (see Dubman, 2000 for more technical detail). The expansion factor, in turn, is defined as the inverse of the probability of the surveyed farm being selected. The survey collects data to measure the financial condition (farm income, expenses, assets, and debts) and operating characteristics of farm businesses, the cost of producing agricultural commodities, and the well-being of farm operator households. Operators associated with farm businesses representing agricultural production across the United States are the target population in the survey. A farm is defined as an establishment that sold or normally would have sold at least $1,000 of agricultural products (cash grains) during the year. Farms can be organized as sole proprietorships, partnerships, family corporations, nonfamily corporations, or cooperatives. Data are collected from one operator per farm, the senior farm operator, who makes most of the day-to-day management decisions. For the purpose of this study, operator households organized as nonfamily corporations or cooperatives and farms not growing cash grains were excluded. We selected farms that planted corn in 2005 and eliminated observations with missing data. Table 1 provides the definitions of the variables used in our analysis and the mean values. Since the ARMS data has a complex survey design and is cross-sectional, it raises the possibility that the error terms in both Tobit models are heteroscedastic. Accordingly, all standard errors were adjusted for heteroscedasticiy using the Huber-White sandwich robust variance estimator based on algorithms contained in STATA (see Huber, 1967;White, 1980). This type of adjustment for standard errors was used in the regression models in lieu of the Jackknife variance estimation method, which is a method suitable for estimation of standard errors when the dataset has a complex survey design (for further detail in the context of the ARMS, see Dubman, 2000) Empirical Results and Analysis: The two-stage simultaneous Tobit model estimates are presented in table 2. The joint significance for the independent variables included in the model are significant at the 1 percent level of significance. Table 2 shows that pseudo-R 2 indicating a good fit 2 is 0.27 for the adoption model and 0.12 for the hours worked off the farm model,. Table 2 also shows the robust standard errors and the t-statistics for the model. The coefficients and their p values merely suggest the direction of the coefficients and its significance. The share of acres planted under GM corn was positively and significantly affected by the mean productivity index of the county, the amount of cash grain payments, the risk averseness of the farmer, and the fact that a farm is located in the North Central and Heartland areas. This conforms to all earlier literature on adoption of new technologies (Dewbre and Mishra, 2007;. Fernandez-Cornejo, et.al., 2000;Fernandez-Cornejo, et.al., 2005;Yang, 1997). Cropping efficiency, number of acres of corn, age of the farmer, and the age-squared variable show no significant impact on the adoption of GM corn in our analysis. Interpreting the regression coefficients in the tobit model is complicated due to the presence of censoring (Tansel and Bircan, 2006). Since the regression coefficient would overestimate the effect on the dependent variable because a proportion of the sample is censored, marginal effects provide unbiased estimates as they take into account the probability of being in the nonlimit portion of the sample (Hobbs, 1997). The decomposition of the marginal effects of the two-stage Tobit model provides a richer and better understanding of the magnitude of the effect of the independent variables on the dependent variable, since coefficients from the Tobit model depict both changes in the probability of being above limit and changes in the value of the dependent variable if it is already above limit (McDonald & Moffitt, 1980). Following earlier literature we present the unconditional marginal effects and the marginal effects conditional on the dependent variable being positive for the two stages in Table 3 and 4 respectively. The tables also provides probability of being uncensored according to equation 15. . The effect of the share of acres planted with GM corn on the hours worked off the farm showed a negative significant influence. This suggests that an increased number of acres of GM corn decreases the farmer's willingness to work off the farm. This may be due to the extra care that farmers who invest in higher priced seeds take to protect their investments. Smith (2002) points to the fact that off-farm labor offsets efficient farming; therefore, adopting new technologies has a potentially negative impact on the off-farm labor supply. Our results show empirically that this is true for farmers who plant GM corn. The proportion of time worked off-farm by the farm operator or spouse was shown by Fernandez-Cornejo et al. (2001) to have a negative impact on the adoption of Bt. Corn -a genetically modified variety of corn. Our study substantiates this finding in the twostage simultaneous model for all GM corn varieties. The test for exogeneity as proposed by Smith and Blundell (1986) was conducted following Baum (1999) to test the endogeneity of acres planted under GM corn and the number of hours worked off the farm. Results from table 2 suggest that we reject the null hypothesis that the two variables are exogeneous and that GM corn should be considered endogenous in our two-stage Tobit model. The off-farm work experience and education show positive significant impacts on the number of hours worked off the farm by farm operators. Results from our model conforms to earlier literature suggesting that number of hours worked off the farm is affected by the share of income from farming (), all types of government payments (), net household worth (),age squared of the farm operator (), and risk aversion factor () have a negative significant impact on the hours worked off the farm, which conforms to earlier literature (Dewbre and Mishra, 2007;El-Osta, Mishra, and Ahearn, 2004;Huffman, 1980;Lamb, 1996;Lass D., 1991;Ahearn, et. al., 2006;Mishra and Goodwin, 1997;Sumner, 1982). Adoption of GM corn has a negative significant impact on the number of hours worked off the farm. This suggests that farmers adopting this new technology tend to work on the farm. Smith (2002) observed that off-farm work may hinder \"smart\" farming techniques and that capital intensive technology may scale dependent. Goodwin and Mishra (2004) showed an inverse relation to farm efficiency and hours worked off Farm operators' off-farm work experience (OPOWEXP) has a significant positive impact on the number of annual hours worked off the farm. This result is in agreement with all earlier studies on the effect of off-farm work experience on off-farm labor supply and off-farm income (Huffman, 1980;Lamb, 1996;Lass, 1991;and Mishra and Goodwin, 1997). Results indicate that an additional year of off-farm work experience increases the number of annual hours worked off the farm by 3 percent, while for those farmers who are already working, the increase is about 2.5 percent."}, {"section_title": "Concluding Remarks", "text": "Sustained corn price increases in the past four years coupled with an increase in demand for alternative use of corn has made it critical for policymakers to understand the factors affecting the adoption of genetically modified corn and GM crops in general. While the introduction of GM corn has been viewed as a time-saving technology, it may also be inducing farm operators to work off the farm; however, other factors, including the risk preference of farmers adopting this new technology and its cost intensiveness outweigh the increased number of hours farmers tend to work off the farm.  Smith (2002)."}, {"section_title": "Limitations and Future Research Directions", "text": "While the research has incorporated the share of farm income to control for the effects of large farms in the model for adoption of GM corn, an explicit 'large' farm has not been defined. As an ongoing research project we plan to address this limitation to our study. Further, to better understand the effects of a higher share of GM crops planted by farmers on the number of hours worked off the farm, we plan to extend this model to include GM cotton and soybean. To increase the robustness of our model we plan to use multiple year ARMS data (2004, 2005, and 2006) to test our current model and add year dummies to capture effects over these three years.     "}]
