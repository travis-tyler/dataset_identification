The differences were greatest between public school eighth graders and eighth graders in private, nonreligious schools. The pupil/teacher ratio of 16.4 in public schools was lower than the average ratio of 20.4 for all private schools. The pupil/teacher ratio for Catholic schools was 22.9, significantly higher than the ratio of 19.0 for other religious schools and 15.2 for private, nonreligious schools. The difference between the ratio of private, nonreligious schools and public schools was not statistically significant. Eighth graders in public schools rated the quality of their teachers lower than their counterparts in private schools. In public schools, 10.8 percent of the eighth graders gave their teachers a high rating, compared with 30.6 percent in Catholic schools, 60.0 percent in other religious schools, and 54.1 percent in private, nonreligious schools. Although there were few differences among types of schools in the amount of math, science, reading, or history required, private schools were much more likely than public schools to require computer education (37.2 percent of private schools versus 15.7 percent of public schools), art (57.4 percent versus 28.7 percent), music (87.8 percent versus 33.7 percent), ethics (44.4 percent versus 2.3 percent), and religion (89.6 percent versus 0.5 percent). Among both public and private schools, size of school was strongly associated with the percentage of schools offering various types of extracurricular activities and special programs. For example, large public schools were more likely than small public schools to offer fine arts, academic clubs, student council, school paper and yearbook, service clubs, and vocational clubs. They were also more likely to offer gifted and talented programs. In 50.4 percent of private schools versus 15.2 percent of public schools, administrators reported a high level of teacher engagementgood rapport between teachers and administrators, high teacher morale, and positive attitudes about students.

They have debated about school size, grade span, grade size, degree of departmentalization, class sin, curriculum, ability grouping, and discipline, among other issues. However, to date they have arrived at no clear consensus on most of these issues, and the Nation's schools providing instruction to students in the middle grades are a diverse lot.' The data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) provide researchers with a unique opportunity to describe the diversity of these schools in much detail. A national sample of 25,000 eighth graders, NELS:88 offers a rich source t... information on the schools these students attended, including 802 public schools, 105 Catholic schools, 68 other religious schools, and 60 private, nonreligious schools. Although some of the information about the schools was supplied by the students, most of the school data were reported by school administrators and are part of the administrator data file. Appendix A provides more information on NELS:88, the sample used for this report, and the procedures used to construct many of the variables that were included in this study. diffeivnt from one another, so that reporting aggregated data for private srhools as a single group blurs significant differences among these three types.2 The report is descriptive and does not include any multivariate analysis. Its findings will be familiar to readers who know schools and should suggest directions for future research and analysis. Additionally, the findings should be of inteitst to parents and the general public. 2Differences among types of schools explicitly cited in the text were found to be statistically significant at a level of 0.05 or lower. Additionally, when comparisons for more than one pair were made, significance was further tested with a stricter Bonferroni test (appendix B). Because of relatively small sample sizes for other religious and private, nonreligious schools, there were sometimes large standard errors associated with some estimates. Consequently, large differences in the means of different types of schools may not be statistically significant. Thus, the reader should use caution when making comparisons of means in the tables included in this report, but not explicitly discussed in the text. Appendix C includes standard errors and the unweighted sample size for all estimates reported in the tables, and the reader is encouraged to calculate tests when comparing estimates."}, {"section_title": "is 1.

The distribution of schools by institutional type, however, was quite different from the distribution of students. Thus, of the schools attended by eighth graders in 1988, 58.8 percent were public, 18.1 percent were Catholic, 19.5 percent were other religious, and 3.7 percent were private, nonreligious schools (figure 1.1, table 1.1).

For example, 70.9 percent of private, other religious schools had fewer than 250 students, compared with only 49.4 percent of Catholic schools. Private, nonreligious schools appeared to be larger, on the average, than both Catholic and other religious schools, but this difference was not statistically significant. Public schools with fewer than 250 students were located mainly in rural areas. While 34.8 percent of rural public schools had fewer than 250 students, only 2.3 percent of urban public schools serving eighth graders had fewer than 250 students (table 1.3). "}, {"section_title": "Grade Size", "text": "The size of the eighth grade class was much more likely to be small in private schools than in public schools.

The percentage of private schools with an eighth grade containing fewer than 21 students ranged from 32.8 pacent for Catholic schools to 77.9 percent for other religious schools. In contrast, 25.0 percent of the public schools had an eighth grade class with more than 200 students, while none of the Catholic and other religious schools had an eighth grade this large. Only 0.2 percent of the private, nonreligious schools had an eighth grade with more than 200 students (table 1.4). "}, {"section_title": "Grade Span", "text": "Public schools were more likely to locate 8th grade in a separate junior high school, middle school, or other intermediate school, while private schools kept 8th grade either with elementary schools or with schools that spanned kindergarten through 12th grade (table 1.6). For example, in 93.0 percent of Catholic schools and 69.0 percent of other religious schools, 8th grade was typically part of an elementary school, compared with only 20.2 percent of public schools; and in 77.6 percent of private nonreligious schools, 8th grade was part of a school spanning kindergarten or 1st grade through 12th grade, compared with 19.5 percent of public schools. Indeed, \"middle schools\" were almost exclusively public; in about 60 percent of public schools, eighth grade was part of a junior high school or other type of school spanning grades six, seven, eight, or nine, while only 2.7 percent of private schools were organized in this fashion. Public middie schools were much more prevalent in urban and suburban areas than in rural ones. More than three-quarters (78.2 percent) of the urban public schools serving eighth graders were middle schools, compared with 69.7 percent of suburban public schools and 47.4 perf:ent of rural public schools (table 1.7). Moreover, eighth grade was included in K-12 schools in 29.1 percent of rural public schools, compared with 14.2 percent of suburban public schools, and 2.1 percent of urban public schools.

Fifty-five percent of Catholic schools were departmentalized, and 43.9 percent were semi-departmentalized. All private, nonreligious schools were departmentalized. Almost one-third of the other religious schools were selfcontained, about one-third departmentalized, and slightly more than one-third semidepartmentalized. "}, {"section_title": "Urbanicity", "text": "Private schools were much more likely to be located in urban areas than were public schools. For example, 42.2 percent of Catholic schools, 38.4 percent of other religious schools, and 49.0 percent of private, nonreligious schools were urban, compared with only 13.9 percent of public schools (figure 1.2, table 1.9). In contrast, 52.6 percent of public schools were located in rural areas, compared with 7.9 percent of Catholic schools, and 23.0 percent of other religious schools. 3In \"self-contained schools,\" the same students are taught by one or more teachers for all or part of the day. In a \"departmentalized school,\" students are taught by different teachers for each subject. In a \"semidepartmentalized school,\" students are taught by different teachers for some of their subjects.   In summary, private schools attended by eighth graders were typically much smaller than public schools, more likely to be in urban areas, and spanned grades K-8 or K-12, rather than specializing in the middle grades. To some extent, private schools did not specialize in the middle grades simply because of their size; most were not large enough to do so. However, even among laiger Catholic schools, where specialization might have occurred more often, the dominant pattern was to include eighth grade in schools that spanned kindergarten through eighth grade rather than establish separate middle schools. In contrast, public schools were much more likely to specialize in the middle grades, except in rural areas where sparsity and the size of the school-age population required schools to serve a wider grade span."}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of Students by Type of School", "text": "The characteristics of the student body varied greatly by type of school.

Enrollment in 27.0 percent of public schools was more than 20 percent minority, compaied with 16.1 percent of private schools (table 2.1, figure 2.1). However, there were significant differences with respect to type of private school. The percentage of Catholic schools with more than 20 percent minority students, 22.3 percent, was not significantly different from that of public schools. However, the percentages of private, other religious schools and private, nonreligious schools with more than 20 percent minority students-11.0 percent and 12.5 percent, respectively-were significantly lower than those of public schools. Additionally, about 14.1 percent of both public and Catholic schools had student bodies that were more than 60 percent minority, a significantly larger percentage than the 1.4 percent of private, nonreligious schools. Although the percentage of private, other religious schools with more than 60 percent minority students, 6.2 percent, appeared lower than the percentages of public and Catholic schools, these differences were not statistically significant. Also, 76.0 percent of other religious schools enrolled no minority students, compared with 33.3 percent of Catholic schools and 25.5 percent of public schools. Public schools were much less likely to have no black students enrolled than private schools. Thus, 47.0 percent of public schools had no black students enrolled, compared with 69.4 percent of private schools. Although all three types of private schools appeared more likely than public schools to have no black students enrolled, the differences were statistically significant only for private, other religious schools where 81.8 percent of the schools had no blacks enrolled. Interestingly, however, 7.2 percent of private other religious schools had enrollments that were more than 50 percent black, about the same as the percentage of public schools, 9.7 percent, and Catholic schools, about 7 percent. Private, nonreligious schools were less likely than public schools to have enrollments that were more than 10 percent black; 24.4 percent of public schools had enrollments with more than 10 percent black students, compared with only 11.2 percent of private, nonreligious schools. Although private, nonreligious and other religious schools were less likely to enroll Hispanic students than public schools, there were no statistically significant difrerences between public and Catholic schools in this distribution by parentage of Hispanic students enrolled. In fact, 86.9 percent of other religious schools and 79.7 percent of private, nonreligious schools enrolled no Hispanic students, compared with 56.1 percent of Catholic schools and 51.6 percent of public schools (table 2.3). About the same percentage of public and Catholic schools, 15 percent, had an Hispanic enrollment of 11 percent or more.   "}, {"section_title": "Home Conditions", "text": "Public schools were much more likely than private schools to enroll students from single-parent families. In 40.8 percent of public schools, more than 25 percent of the students enrolled lived in single-parent families, compared with 14.6 percent of private schools (table 2.6). There was, however, considerable variation among types of private schools. For example, while 39.3 percent of private, other religious schools had no students from single-parent families enrolled, only 3.5 percent of Catholic schools had no children with single parents. Indeed, on this measure, no significant difference existed between Catholic and public schools, of which only 4.5 percent had no students with single parents. It appears that private, nonreligious schools were also more likely to have no students with single parents, but the differences between these schools and public and Catholic schools were not statistically significant. Among urban public schools, the percentage of schools with high concentrations of students from single-parent families was very high. For example, 39.6 percent of urban public schools enrolled 26 percent to 50 percent of their students from single-parent families; 33.7 percent of urban public schools enrolled more than half of their students from single-parent families (table 2.7). In contrast, only 19.3 percent of urban Catholic schools enrolled 26 percent to 50 percent of their students from single-parent families, and only 9.2 percent of urban Catholic schools enrolled more than half of their students from single-parent families.

In the public schools, 58.8 percent of the eighth graders planned to obtain a bachelor's degree or higher. Comparable percentages for all three types of private schools were significantly higher. In Catholic schools, 75.8 percent of eighth graders planned to obtain a bachelor's degree or higher, as did 77.0 percent of the eighth graders in other religious schools and 86.8 percent in private, nonreligious schools. Only 1.7 percent of the eighth graders in public schools and less than 0.5 percent in private schools said they planned to drop out of high school. On the average, graduate school figured prominently in the plans of 46.9 percent of the eighth graders in private, nonreligious schools, compared with 24.4 percent of students in other religious schools, 29.4 percent in Catholic schools, and 19.0 percent in public schools. A higher percentage of eighth graders in public schools (11.2 percent) planned to attend postsecondary vocational-technical schools than eighth graders in Catholic schools (5.9 percent) and private, nonreligious schools (3.5 percent). Interestingly, there were virtually no differences in the educational aspirations of eighth graders attending urban public schools versus those attending suburban or rural public schools. Only 2.0 percent of urban eighth graders planned to drop out, as did 1.3 percent of suburban eighth graders and 1.9 percent of rural students (table 2.10). About 86 percent of urban, suburban, and rural public school eighth graders all aspired to some postsecondary education. Although a somewhat lower percentage of urban students planned to finish college, 35.8 percent, than suburban eighth graders, 41.5 percent, the difference was not great. Moreover, about the same percentage of urban and suburban public school eighth graders aspired to graduate school. "}, {"section_title": "Test Scores", "text": "Psychological and achievement tests were administered to the eighth graders participating in NELS:88. The psychological tests sought to measure students' self-concept and locus of control. Students who scored high on the measure of self-concept were those who indicated that they agreed strongly with such statements as \"I feel good about myself;\" \"I feel I am a person of worth, the equal of other people;\" \"I am able to do things as well as most other people;\" and \"On the whole, I am satisfied with myself.\" Students who scored high on the measure of locus of control were those who strongly disagreed with such statements as \"In my life, good luck is more important than hard work for success;\" \"Every time I try to get ahead, something or somebody stops me;\" and \"My plans hardly ever work out, so planning only makes me unhappy.\" Overall, there was no statistically significant difference between public and private schools in the percentage of students receiving high scores on measures of self-concept. Although it appears that a higher percentage of Catholic school students, 38.3 percent, and students in private, nonreligious schools, 39.2 percent, scored higher on these indicators than did public school students, 33.9 percent (table 2.11), these differences were not statistically significant. On measures of locus of control, 32.4 percent of public school students obtained a high score, compared with 42.5 percent of private school students. The percentages of students with high scores on locus of control were greater in other religious schools than in Catholic schools, 45.9 percent compared with 39.5 percent. Although the percentage of students with high scoms in private, nonreligious schools (39.9 percent) also appeared higher than that of public schools, this difference was not statistically significant. On four tests of student achievement, eighth graders in private schools had average test scores that were higher than those of public school eighth graders. Overall, students in private schools scored higher than public school students on all four tests. In general, the differences were greatest between public school eighth graders and their peers in private, nonreligious schools. The smallest differences typically occurred between Catholic and public schools. Specifically, eighth graders in public schools had an average score of 49.7 in math versus 51.6 for eighth graders in Catholic schools, 49.6 in reading versus 53.3, 50.0 in science versus 51.5, and 49.7 in history versus 53.5 (table 2.12). Although test scores in private, nonreligious schools were higher on all four tests than scores in Catholic schools, these differences were not statistically significant. Test scores in urban public schools were significantly lower than those in suburban and rural public schools. Scores in urban public schools averaged between 45.5 and 46.3 on ters of math, reading, science, and history, compared with scores averaging between 49.8 and 50.9 in suburban and rural schools (table 2.13). In summary, there were major differences between public and private schools in the characteristics of the students they served. Generalizations, however, must be made with care, because public and private schools varied substantially. In some respects, Catholic schools resembled public schools more than they did other religious schools or private, nonreligious schools. About one-quarter of public and Catholic schools had enrollments that were more than 20 percent minority, with these schools tending to enroll black and Hispanic students in about the same proportions. Although Catholic schools enrolled much higher percentages of students from single-parent families than did other private schools, the percentages of students from single-parent families were even higher in public schools, especially in urban areas. In terms of students' future educational plans and scores on various tests, however, Catholic schools were more like other private schools. In fact, students in Catholic schools were much more likely than their counterparts in public schools to aspire to 4 years or more of postsecondary education. They also scored higher on tests of locus of control. Finally, students in Catholic schools also scored higher than those in public schools on achievement tests in math, reading, science, and history. 4 0"}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of the Learning Environment", "text": "Eighth graders were exposed to a variety of learning environments, which differed within and among types of schools.

A higher percentage of public schools (65.0 percent) had a school year of 180 days or more, compared with other religious schools (52.0 percent).

All iypes of schools averaged about 7 classes per day, with no statistically significant differences among types. Consequently, among schools the major difference in the length of the school day was the average length of each class rather than the number of classes offered daily. For instance, the average length of each class was 48.3 minutes in public schools, 45.3 minutes in Catholic schools, and 52.0 minutes in private, nonreligious schools. Average daily attendance was higher in Catholic schools (95.9 percent) and in private, other religious schoois (96.0 percent) than in public schools (93.8 percent), but there was no significant difference between public and private, nonreligious schools (94.0 percent). Among public schools, the average length of the school day was somewhat longer in rural schools, 6.6 hours, than in urban schools, 6.4 hours (table 3.4). Rural public schools also averaged more classes per day than urban public schools, 7.2 versus 6.9, and classes in rural schools were slightly longer on average, 49.1 minutes versus 47.6 minutes. Hence, the tendency for rural public schools to have shorter school years than urban schools may have been offset, at least in part, by longer days and more classes per day. Average daily attendance was higher in rural public schools (94.3 percent) and suburban public schools (94.0 percent) than in urban public schools (91.7 percent). However, average daily attendance in urban Catholic schools (95.7 percent) exceeded that of public schools in both urban and suburban locations.

In contrast, 38.0 percent of Catholic schools had pupil/teacher ratios greater than 25:1, compared with only 3.3 percent of public schools, and 18.5 percent of other religious schools. The average pupil/teacher ratio was 16.4 in public schools, 22.9 in Catholic schools, 19.0 in other religious schools, and 15.2 in private, nonreligious schools (table 3.5, figure 3.1). To some extent, the low pupil/teacher ratios for public schools reflect the fact that a much higher percentage of public schools than private schools were small and were located in rural areas. For example, although 35.8 percent of urban public schools had pupil/teacher ratios of less than 16:1, 54.9 pero.nt of rural public schools had such low ratios (table 3.6). Nevertheless, only 1.1 percent of urban Catholic schools had pupil/teacher ratios of less than 16:1.

Pupil/teacher ratios averaged 17.2 in urban public schools, 23.3 in urban Catholic schools, 17.0 in suburban public schools, and 15.7 in rural public schools.   The size of pupil/teacher ratios incteased as size of school increased, especially in the public sector.

Moreover, there was no significant difference between private schools with fewer than 250 students and those with 500 to 999 students. The average pupil/teacher ratio of private schools with 250 to 499 students, 23.5, was significantly higher than the ratio of schools with fewer than 250 students, 18.9; however, there was no significant difference between the ratio of schools with 500 to 999 students and schools with fewer than 250. In public schools, pupil/teacher ratios were lowest in all-white schools. In public schools with no minority students, the pupil/teacher ratio averaged 14.5, increasing to 16.8 in schools with some but less than 6 percent minorities, 17.1 in schools with 6 percent to 20 percent minorities, 16.7 in schwls with 21 percent to 60 percent minorities, and 17.2 in schools with more than 60 percent minorities (table 3.8). This relationship between pupil/teacher ratio and percentage minority may result simply from school size.

In public schools, 10.8 percent of the eighth graders gave their teachers a high rating, compared with 30.6 percent 5For an explanation of the construction of this composite measure of teacher quality, see Appendix A. in Catholic schools, 60.0 percent in other religious schools, and 54.1 percent in private, nonreligious schools. In summary, the learning environments of public and private schools varied considerably. On the average, public and Catholic schools operated more days per year than did other religious or private, nonreligious schools. In public schools, the school day was longer than in Catholic schools but shorter than the day in other religious or private, nonreligious schools. The average pupil/teacher ratio was much higher in Catholic schools than it was in public schools or other private schools. The percentage of minority faculty was about twice as great in public schools than in private schools. with private, nonreligious schools employing the fewest minority teachers. However, in all types of schools, the percentage of minority faculty on average was lower than that of minorities in the population at large. The percentage of teachers with graduate degrees was much higher in public schools than it was in Catholic or other religious schools, although private, nonreligious schools appear to have had the highest percentage of teachers with graduate degrees. In other religious and private, nonreligious schools, about five times as many students rated their teachers highly than did students in public schools, and almost three times as many students in Catholic schools than in public schools gave their teachers high marks."}, {"section_title": "School Policies and Programs", "text": "NELS:88 provides an interesting snapshot of policies and programs in schools serving eighth graders.

Higher percentages of Catholic and private, nonreligious schools required a full year of science and history than did public schools. Nevertheless, more than 90 percent of public schools required a full year in these subjects. Requirements in other subjects varied greatly. Computer education was required in 15.7 percent of the public schools, 49.9 percent of the Catholic schools, 23.4 percent of the other religious schools, and 40.5 percent of the private, nonreligious schools. Foreign language was required in about 15 percent of public, Catholic, and other religious schools, versus 60.0 percent of private, nonreligious schools. Sex education was required in 29.0 percent of Catholic schools, 20.4 percent of private, nonreligious schools, 11.3 percent of public schools, and 5.6 percent of other religious schools. Only 2.3 percent of the public schools required ethics, but this subject was required in 56.4 percent of the Catholic schools and 38.4 percent of other religious schools. All Catholic schools and 94.2 percent of the other religious schools required students to take religion courses, compared with 13.4 percent of the private, nonreligious schools and 0.5 percent of the public schools. In the public schools, school size appeared to affect some course requirements. For example, only 4.0 percent of schools with fewer than 250 students required a foreign language, while 22.7 percent of those with more than 1,000 students did so (table 4.2). Similarly, 79.3 peroait Gf the schools with fewer than 250 students required physical education, versus 93.4 percent of schools with more than 1,000 students, but this difference was not statistically significant. In other subjects, school size did not appear to be related to course requirements. For example, 16.0 percent of schools with fewer than 250 students required computer education, compared with 14.3 percent of schools with Incx than 1,000 students. Differences in the percentages of schools requiring art and music were also insignificant among schools of various sizes. "}, {"section_title": "Extracurricular Offerings", "text": "Generally, public schools were more likely to offer eighth graders extracurricular activities than were private schools. For example, 92.4 percent of public schools offered fine arts, versus 79.5 percent of private schools (table 4.3). Public schools were also more likely to provide academic clubs, student council, sports and cheerleading, and vocational clubs. The only extracurricular activities provided more often by private schools were religious clubs in the Catholic and other religious schools. It appears that these differences in offerings between public and private schools may have been heavily influenced by the private, other religious schools. With the exception of religious clubs and vocational clubs, other religious schools consistently provided lower percentages of extracurricular activities than did Catholic or private, nonreligious schools. These differences, however, were not always statistically significant. G:ven that the other religious schools tended to be smaller than the other types of private schools, the differences in the percentages of schools providing extracurricular activities may have been largely a function of size rather than any philosophical differences about the desirability of these activities. Indeed, differences in school size may account generally for the differences between public and private schools in extracurricular offerings. The figures in table 4.4 suggest that size does have a major influence on schools' provision of extracurricular offerings. With the exception of religious clubs and vocational clubs in private schools, the percentage of schools providing a particular extracurricular activity increased as the size of the school grew-a relationship that was equally true for both public and private schools. For example, 77.1 percent of public schools with fewer than 250 students provided fine arts, compared with more than 97.9 percent of public schools with 500 to 999 students (table 4.4). Among the smallest public schools, 64.8 percent had a school paper or yearbook, versus 88.9 percent of the public schools with more than 1,000 students. Larger schools were also much more likely to have academic clubs and student councils. In short, economies of scale appear to be strongly associated with providing extracurricular activities.6 Similarly, private schools with 500 to 999 6Extracurricular activities were also more likely to be available in public schools when students attended a middle school rather than an elementary or high school, and the percentage of schools offering extracurricular activities increased as the size of the eighth grade class grew.

"}, {"section_title": "Special Instructional Programs and Counseling", "text": "The schools serving eighth graders varied greatly in the kinds of special instructional programs they offered. For example, public schools were much more likely to offer students gifted and talented programs (GATE) than were private schools. While about twothirds of public schools provided some kind of GATE program, only 20.2 percent of Catholic schools, 12.7 percent of other religious schools, and 13.3 percent of private, nonreligious schools offered them (table 4.5). GATE programs were much more likely to be found in larger schools, both public and private, possibly suggesting that smaller schools were less likely to provide such programs because their enrollments were not large enough to justify the additional cost (table 4.6). 'f  Higher percentages of students in public schools were enrolled in special programs than in private schools. Public schools had significantly higher percentages of students than private schools enrolled in English as a Second Language (1.1 percent versus 0.1 percent) special education (7.3 percent versus 1.4 percent), GATE (5.9 percent versus 2.4 percent), job training (0.8 percent versus 0.1 percent), remedial math (7.2 percent versus 3.5 percent), and remedial English (10.4 percent versus 4.6 percent), as shown in table 4.7. Among public schools, the percentages of students enrolled in several special programs were higher in urban schools than in rural or suburban schools. In urban public schools, 2.8 percent of students were enrolled in bilingual education versus 0.8 percent of students in rural schools; 3.3 percent of urban students were enrolled in ESL versus 0.5 percent of rural students (table 4.8). The percentage of students in urban schools enrolled in remedial math and English was more than twice as great as the percentage in suburban schools and about three times as great as that in rural schools (figure 4.1). Independent counseling appeared to figure more prominently in public schools than in Catholic schools. That is, 39.4 percent of administrators of public schools reported that counselors had \"a lot\" of influence over student assignments to high school classes, compared with only 16.8 percent of Catholic schools (table 4.9). At the other extreme, 40.7 percent of Catholic schools reported that counselors had no influence on high school class assignments, compared with only 9.5 percent of the public schools. Counselors at private, nonreligious schools also appeared to have more influence on assignments to high school than did counselors in Catholic schools; however, these differences were not statistically significant. Counseling had less influence in the other religious schools than in public schools, and while it also appeared to have less influence in other religious than in private, nonreligious schools, this difference was not statistically significant. The influence of counselors also appeared to increase as school size grew, possibly because small schools were unable to provide independent counseling and relied instead on teachers. Although the difference was not statistically significant, 33.3 percent of the public schools with fewer than 250 students reported that counselors had \"a lot\" of influence over high school class assignments, versus 46.8 percent of schools with 1,000 students or more (table 4.10).7 Almost one-fifth of the public schools with fewer than 250 students said counselors had no influence, compared with only 2.2 percent of schools with more than 1,000 students, and this difference was statistically significant. A similar pattern prevailed for private schools.8 7The difference between schools with fewer than 250 students (33.3 percent) and those with more than 1,000 (46.8 percent) is not statistically significant when schools responded \"a lot,\" but is significant for schools that responded \"none.\" 8As with public schools, the difference was not statistically significant for schools responding \"a lot,\" but was statistically significant for schools responding \"none.\" "}, {"section_title": "Admissions Procedures and Other Policies", "text": "Most private schools used a formal application to determine admission, and most public schools based school assignment on geography. While 82.2 percent of Catholic schools, 85.2 percent of other religious schools, and 100.0 percent of private, nonreligious schools used a formal application to determine admissions, only 9.4 percent of public schools did so (table 4.11). Among the public schools, 27.2 percent did allow transfers to other schools within the district, and 6.1 percent took racial balance into consideration when assigning students to schools.9 9The percentage that took racial balance into consideration may seem low. Recall that there are a large number of rural, one-school districts in the sample, where there are no alternatives. More than 25 percent of the urban public schools took racial balance into consideration in assigning students to schools. In both public and private schools, the most common reason for retaining students in the eighth grade was failure of a required course. For example, 55.2 percent of public schools, 32.9 percent of Catholic schools, 58.7 percent of other religious schools, and 48.0 percent of private, nonreligious schools indicated that failure of a requiled course was grounds for retention (table 4.12). Some schools, however, based retention on failure of a specific test in reading, math, science, English, or history. Moreover, public schools were more lAely than private schools to use reading and math tests for determining retention. Thus, 18.3 percent of public schools relied on a reading test, compared with 9.5 percent of private schools; 17.1 percent of public schools retained students who failed a math test, versus 9.6 percent of private schools. More than one-half of all types of private schools and more than three-quarters of public schools reported having a \"no pass/no play\" policy. These policies require students to maintain a minimum grade-point average in order to participate in school activities such as athletics. In summary, virtually all schools serving eighth graders, whether public or private, required \"the basics.\" One year of math, reading, science, and history was typically a requirement of 85 percent or more of all types of schools in the sample. Beyond \"the basics,\" however, private schools tended to exert greater demands, especially for computer education, foreign languages, art, music, family-sex education, ethics, and religion. There were, nevertheless, significant differences in requirements among different types of private schools. For instance, foreign language was a requirement in about 60 percent of the private, nonreligious schools, compared with about 15 percent of the Catholic and other religious schools. With a few exceptions, public schools offered more extracurricular activities than private schoolq, although again significant differences were present among types of private schools. Sr A size was strongly associated with the provision of extracurricular activities in bo... public and private schools; as size increased, the percentage of schools offering a particular activity grew. Moreover, size appeared to be associated with the provision of special instructional programs and counseling in both public and private schools. With respect to school admissions policies, geography dominated in public schools, while all types of private schools required formal applications. Both public and private schools tended to rely primarily on failure of a required course as the basis for retention versus promotion, although at least 10 percent of the public and Catholic schools relied on test scores in reading, math, or English. About one-half of the private schools and about three-quarters of public schools had \"no pass/no play\" policies."}, {"section_title": "School Climate", "text": "School administrators reported a number of observations about the general climate in schools serving eighth graders.

Overall 50.4 percent of private school administrators reported a high level of teacher engagement, versus 15.2 percent of public school administrators. Engagement appeared to be highest in Catholic schools, where administrators in 58.8 percent of the schools reported high levels; 44.6 percent of the other religious schools and 40.1 percent of the private, nonreligious schools reported high levels (table 5.1). A scale was constructed to summarize the responses to the various questions on teacher engagement.1\u00b0 The average score of 4.0 in public schools was significantly lower than scores of 4.5 in Catholic schools and 4.4 in other religious schools. The publi_. school score also appeared to be lower than the score of 4.3 in private, nonreligious schools, but this difference was not statistically significant. 10For explanation of the construction of this and subsequent scales in this section, see Appendix A. The level of teacher engagement appeared to decline as the size of school increased. In public schools with fewer than 250 students, 22.3 percent of administrators reported a high level of teacher engagement, compared with 8.6 percent of schools with enrollments of 1,000 or more; however, this difference was not statistically significant (table 5.2). If the difference is real, how much of it is strictly a furiction of size is unclear, because many of the larger schools were also urban, where working conditions were often difficult. In urban public schools attended by eighth graders, only 6.9 percent of le administrators reported a high level of teacher engagement, compared with 13.0 percent in suburban schools, but this difference was not statistiully significant (table 5.3). However, the difference between the level of teacher engagement in urban schools, 6.9 percent, and rural schools, 18.7 percent, was significant. Multivariate analysis of the independent effects of size would, therefore, be useful.

This scale combined the responses of administrators to questions about tardiness, absenteeism, fighting, vandalism, drug use, and physical and verbal abuse.

In Catholic schools, 44.9 percent of the administrators reported high levels of good behavior by students, as did 58.0 percent of administrators in other religious schools (table 5.4). These percentages were significantly higher than the percentage of public school administrators reporting high levels of good behavior, 10.3 percent. The Catholic and other religious school percentages were also higher than those of private, nonreligious schools, but the difference between Catholic and private, nonreligious schools was not statistically significant.

The average score of 4.0 in public schools was lower than the score of 4.2 for private schools (table 5.6). While 23.9 percent of public school administrators reported a high level of emphasis on academics, 39.1 percent of private school administrators did so. Although greater percentages of administrators in all three types of private schools reported a higher level of emphasis on academics than did public school administrators, none of these differences were statistically significant.

By a large margin, private schools of all types were much more restrictive than public schools. For example, 60.3 percent of Catholic, 64.4 percent of other religious schools, and 51.3 percent of private, nonreligious schools had low scores, compared wit'i 19.1 percent of public schools (table 5.7).

Urban schools also appeared to be less restrictive than suburban schools, although the difference was not statistically significant. Urban public schools were substantially less restrictive than urban Catholic schools. Unrestrictiveness also tended to increase as school size increased. Among public schools, 45.0 percent of the schools with fewer than 250 students had low scores, indicating the most restrictions, compared with only 0.5 percent of schools with 1,000 students or more (table 5.9). The trend was not as strong among private schools, but as with public schools, unrestrictiveness tended to increase as size increased.

A scale similar to those discussed previously combined the answers to these questions, with a higher score indicating a more structured, disciplined environment. Overall, there was a higher level of discipline in private schools than in public schools, but this difference was attributable mainly to the influence of the Catholic and other religious schools. Religious schools were more structured and disciplined than public schools. Catholic schools had an average score of 4.7 on the combined scale, and other religious schools averaged 4.6; public schools averaged 4.4 (table 5.10).

"}, {"section_title": "63", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The data from NELS:88 underscore an apparent fact: in 1988, American eighth graders attended a variety of different types of schools. For most observers of American education, this fact is not news. Nevertheless, the data from NELS:88 provide an important reminder of the diverse conditions under which American children learn. The data also highlight some important underlying characteristics that are easily forgotten amidst the stereotypes that have grown up around American schools. Private schools attended by eighth graders were indeed different from public schools. Generally, in the private sector, schools were smaller, student achievement was higher, aspirations for higher education were greater, the curriculum was richer, the faculty were more engaged, and there were fewer problems with student behavior. In general, public schools served much higher proportions of minority students, those with limited English proficiency, and those from single-parent families. Public schools also were almost exclusively responsible for serving students in rural America and for coping with the difficulties of providing rich educational offerings in sparsely populated areas. On some important measures, however, the differences between public and certain types of private schools became blurred. Private schools were, in fact, a rather heterogeneous lot. Thus, many Catholic schools served proportions of minority students that were about as high as those in many public schools. Pupil/teacher ratios were significantly higher in Catholic schools than in public schools, and Catholic school teachers were less likely to have graduate degrees.11 Consequently, while Catholic schools may have enjoyed some of the benefits of selectivity typical of other private schools, they nevertheless often educated very different types of students, in larger classes, with teachers having less graduate education than those who taught in other private schools or, for that matter, in many public schools. Public schools were quite heterogeneous as well, and among the many differences that data from NELS:88 underscore were the contrasts between urban, suburban, and rural public schools. The data from NELS:88 indicate that there are serious problems in many urban middle schools. For instance, in one-third of the urban schools serving eighth graders, more than half of the students enrolled lived in single-parent families. In urban public schools, eighth graders consistently scored much lower than their counterparts in suburban and rural schools on tests of knowledge in reading, math, science, and history. The percentage of students in urban schools enrolled in remedial math and English was more than twice as great as the percentage in suburban schools and about three times as great as that in rural schools. In urban public schools serving eighth graders, the percentage of administrators reporting high teacher engagement was only 6.9 percent, compared with 18.7 percent in rural schools. About half of urban public schools reported significant problems with student behavior, compared with about one-fourth of suburban and rural public schools. Interestingly, despite these problems, eighth graders in urban public schools displayed not only a certain realism about their situation but also a cautious optimism. 11These are not necessarily new observations; they are consistent with those made by earlier comparisons of public and private high schools and reveal that some of the same patterns exist in schools attended by eighth giaders. See, for example, James S. Coleman and Thomas Hoffer, Public and Private High Schools: The Impact of Communities (New York: Basic Books, 1987). Although eighth graders in public schools generally rated the quality of their teachers much lower than did their peers in private schools, the marks students in urban public schools gave teachers differed only slightly from those given by students in suburban public schools. Conditions may have been tough in urban public schools, but urban eighth graders were no more inclined than students in other public schools to cite poor teaching as part of their predicament. Moreover, the educational aspirations of eighth graders in urban public schools were not much different from those of their counterparts in suburban or rural public schools. Only 2.0 percent of eighth graders in urban public schools actually planned to drop out of high schoola proportion that was not much different from the 1.3 percent of eighth graders in suburban schools or the 1.9 percent in rural schools. There was virtually no difference in the proportion of urban eighth graders aspiring to postsecondary education from that of suburban and rural eighth graders with the same goal. If the past is any indicator of the future, clearly much larger percentages of eighth graders attending urban schools will drop out, and far fewer will pursue or complete some form of postsecondary education. However, if these results are rereated for the eighth graders in the urban schools of NELS:88, these outcomes cannot be attributed to lower student aspirations. Eighth graders in urban public schools appear to have aspired to the same educational goals as eighth graders elsewhere. While on many measures eighth graders in rural schools appear to have fared better than those in urban schools, the data from NELS:88 raise some concerns that warrant closer scrutiny. In rural areas where sparse populations lead to relatively small school size, it appears that size may have negatively affected the quality of school offerings. For example, in small rural public schools, there were fewer requirements for eighth graders to take a foreign language, and physical education and extracurricular activities were more limited. In addition, counseling appeared to be less available in small schools. Small schools, however, are not located only in rural areas, and this issue of school size needs closer attention. The results reported here indicate that both public and private schools with fewer than 250 students were less able to provide a rich curriculum, a variety of extracurricular activities, special programs, and counseling. On the other hand, smaller schools also reported higher levels of faculty engagement and fewer problems with student discipline. A thorough analysis of the pros and cons of different sizes of schools, including an assessment of possible relationships to student achievement, could be quite valuable. In short, the patterns revealed in this report about the schools attended by eighth graders in NELS:88 provoke a number of interesting questions for future research. What can be discovered from NELS:88 about the widely divergent conditions under which eighth graders learned? Do any of these differences significantly affect students' future levels of achievement, staying in high school, choice of high school courses, matriculation at postsecondary institutions, success in the labor market, or a host of other social, educational, and labor market outcomes eqsociated with their future success or failure? These and other questions should stimulate interest in the data generated by NELS:88 for many years to come. Estimates in this report were based on the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 eighth graders (NELS:88). All data were drawn from the base-year survey, primarily from the administrator survey. A few variables were obtained from the student survey, which are noted below. All estimates for this sample were calculated using ADMWT, restricting the analysis to the 1,035 schools whose administrators participated in the administrator survey. (Students from 1,052 schools were surveyed in the base year of NELS:88.) For more information on the NELS:88 surveys, interested readers should consult Inge ls et aL, National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 Base Year: Student Component Data File Users' Manua/ (Chicago: National Opinion Research Center, 1989). Variables for the tables in Section 1, General School Characteristics, and in Section 2, Characteristics of Students by Type of School, were selected to describe basic school characteristics, mainly aspects of school structure: sector, urbanicity, school size, size of eighth grade class, grade span, and departmentalization. Each variable was taken directly from the administrator data file. A composite variable was created as a row variable from the sector and urbanicity variables to facilitate comparison between suburban public and private schools, as well a between urban public and private schools. Due to the small number of schools in the sample, some of the logically possible categories of the sectorurbanicity composite had to be collapsed into more general categories. In Section 2, all variables were taken from the administrator file except those in tables 2.9, 2.10, 2.11, 2.12, and 2.13. Thus, the estimates of percentages of minority students are the administrators' own estimates of student body characteristics. The variables in table 2.9 are the percentage of students at each school with particular postsecondary plans. These values were calculated from values for BYPSEPLN for students at each school, using the student weights (BYQWT). The variables for table 2.11 are the mean values for students from each school for the percentage in the top third of students at each school in self-concept and locus of control. Variables for tables 2.12 and 2.13 are school means of students' scores on a series of academic tests. (These tests and scales are described in the users' manual referenced above.) These means were calculated using the student weight (BYQWT). It should be noted that the variables in tables 2.9, 2.10, 2.11, 2.12, and 2.13 are based on student responses and therefore represent sample values for each school. Nearly all of the variables in Section 3, Characteristics of the Learning Environment, are taken from the administrator file. The only exceptions are the variables in table 3.12 for students' rating of teacher quality, which were taken from the student file. First, a scale was created for each student from five items concerning teacher quality (BYS59A, BYS59F, BYS59G, BYS59I, and BYS59.1). This scale was calculated by taking the mean value of valid items for each student. Next, the mean rating of teacher quality was calculated for all students at each school, using the student weights (BYQWT). This score provided the variable for mean student rating of teacher quality. The other variables concerning teacher quality were created by taking the schools with average student ratings that were high (in the top quartile), low (in the bottom quartile), or medium (from the 25th to the 75th percentile). The other composite variables created for Section 3 are the faculty ethnicity variables in table 3.9. These variables were created by NORC at MPR's request, since the data to create these percentages were not available in the public release data files. Each variable was created by dividing the number of teachers in a category at the school by the total number of teachers. All of the variables in Section 4, School Policies and Programs, were taken from the administrator file. Several composites were created for this section. In table 4.5, BYSC40 was used to create the row for no GATE program, when BYSC40 was equal to 2. In addition, many of the columns in Tables 4.3 and 4.4 are also taken from composite variables. The table below shows how variables in the administrator file were combined to make those for tables 4.3 and 4.4."}, {"section_title": "Extracurricular activities offered", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Source", "text": "Original category Consolidated categoty"}, {"section_title": "BYSC46A", "text": "Acad. honors soc. All variables in Section 5, School Climate, were taken from the administrator file. Each row represents the percentage of schools rating high (top quartile), medium (from the 25th to the 75th percentile), or low (bottom quartile) on a scale created by combining responses to several items the school administrators were asked. The table below shows the scales created and the input variables for each. For each scale, a factor and a reliability analysis showed the feasibility of combining the items into a scale. (The alpha statistic for each scale is shown in the * These items were reverse-coded for consistency of scaling. The NELS:88 sample used a complex, multistage sample design. Students were initially selected within schools grouped within strata. Sampling rates for schools within different strata varied, resulting in better data for policy purposes, but at a cost to statistical efficiency. Hence, simple random sample techniques for estimating standard errors frequently underestimate the true standard errors for some estimates. To overcome this problem, standard errors for all estimates in this report were calculated using Taylor residual techniques. To compare estimates for separate subgroups, or to understand the quality of the estimates, standard errors are needed. While the estimates based on 30 or fewer cases were suppressed, the computer automatically produced estimates for subgroups with 31 or more cases. Standard errors and unweighted N for all estimates included in this report may be found in Appendix C. The following table shows where a few key statistics and their standard errors are located. where P1 and P2 are the estimates to be compared, and sei and se2 are their corresponding standard errors. A hazard in reporting statistical tests for each comparison is that, when making multiple comparisons among categories of an independent variable (for example, different levels of income), the probability of a Type I error for these comparisons taken as a group is larger than that for a single comparison. When more than one difference between groups of related characteristics or \"families\" are tested for statistical significance, a standard must be applied that assures a level of significance for all of those comparisons taken together. In order to reduce the probability of Type I error in a set of multiple comparisons, the author of this report calculated Bonferroni intervals based on families of Student' s t tests. Families of tests were defined as pairwise tests comparing an outcome for two or more related categories of students. For example, a comparison among three types of private schools is a family of tests involving three possible pairs-1) Catholic with other religious schools, 2) Catholic with private, nonreligious schools, and 3) other religious schools with private, nonreligious schools. If, in addition, a comparison is made between public schools and each type of private school, there are six possible pairs. The width of a Bonferroni interval depends upon the number of comparisods of interest within a family. When only one pairwise comparison is made, the Bonferroni interval is the same as the confidence interval obtained from a Student' s t test. The more comparisons that are of inten st, the narrower the Bonferroni intervil and, thus, the greater the t statistic needed for each difference to guarantee a significance p .05 for all of the comparisons taken together.17 Comparisons were made in this report only when p 5 .05/k for a particular pairwise comparison, where that comparison was one of k tests within a family. This guarantees both that the individual comparison would have p .05 and that when k comparisons were made within a family of possible tests, the significance level of the comparisons would sum to p < .05.18 s 0                                           "}]
