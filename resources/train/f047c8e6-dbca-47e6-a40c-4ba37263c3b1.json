(Jencks and Peterson, 1991; Cook and Goss, 1996; and Duncan and Raudenbush, 1999 , provide reviews.) Many of the links occur when classmates act as role models, provide information, create norms, and enforce norms with peer pressure. Similarly, adults in a neighborhood can contribute to youths' success in and outside of school when they act as role models; provide information about schools, families, and careers; and create and enforce norms. In addition, advantaged neighborhoods typically have better infrastructure, such as school quality, due in part to parents' ability to spend time and money and in part to greater political power."}, {"section_title": "1", "text": "At the same time, some of the correlation is surely due to sorting, not causality.\nThat is, the presence of clusters of good role models is due to the choice of people who make good role models to live near each other.

Because we rely on average test scores as our measure of school and neighborhood quality, our procedure attributes to neighborhoods only the subset of attributes of a school or neighborhood that correlate with average test scores. This restrictive set of school and neighborhood attributes is not a problem as long as we focus on test scores as our outcome of interest.\nWe are concerned that family background is measured with error, so we observe an imperfect proxy for true family background FB i * , where:"}, {"section_title": "2.", "text": ".\nConceptually, correctly measuring school and neighborhood effects requires the history of the neighborhoods that a child has lived in (Hanushek, 1986) . But as is common in the literature, we measure school and neighborhood quality at a single point in time. Correspondingly, our cross-sectional estimates of the effects of schools and neighborhoods largely measure the role of a lifetime increase in neighborhood quality, not merely short-term changes.\nBecause of the difficulty in measuring family background (as in equation 2), the most convincing evidence that some of the disadvantages of a poor neighborhood are at least partly causal comes from experiments that moved a subset of disadvantaged families out of a ghetto neighborhood and into the suburbs. In the Gatreaux experiment, the Chicago Housing Authority provided rent vouchers that moved a number of central-city Chicago public housing residents into the suburbs or elsewhere in the central city (Rosenbaum, 1995) . Because the assignment of families to suburban or city apartments was almost completely random, the Gatreaux experience provided a natural experiment for understanding the gains from housing desegregation.\nThe children who moved to the suburbs had much better academic success than did those who stayed in the cities. When the children were approximately 18, those who had moved to the suburbs had one-fourth the high school dropout rate of their counterparts who had moved within the poor neighborhoods of Chicago (5 percent vs. 20 percent). Moreover, children who grew up in the suburbs were more than twice as likely to attend college.\nPreliminary evidence from similar experiments in other cities suggests that movement away from high-crime areas lowers youths' involvement in some juvenile crime and improves adults' health, reduces rates of crime victimization, and (in some studies) increases employment and earnings (Ludwig, Duncan, and Hirschfield, 1999; Ludwig, Duncan, and Pinkston, 2001; Katz et al., 2000) . At the same time, many of the estimated neighborhood effects are not statistically significant, and in some studies better neighborhoods predict worse outcomes. Moreover, these experimental populations are not representative of youths in general because they focus on the very poor and on households that have chosen to participate.\nThe anthropological literature on very disadvantaged neighborhoods also provides evidence that within-neighborhood correlations are at least partly causal. In the nation's worst neighborhoods, young men are more likely to consider gangs, not school, the dominant institution. In these settings, many students perceive that \"playing by the rules\" by working hard in school and staying out of trouble with the law does not pay; schools are often quite bad, and employment prospects even after graduating from high school are poor. Moreover, youths are more likely to be punished than rewarded by their peers for academic success. (Cook and Ludwig, 1998 , review the evidence for and against this claim.)"}, {"section_title": "The Standard Method", "text": "When experimental data are not available, it is necessary to estimate a specification similar to equation 1 with field data. One advantage our regression analyses based on a national sample have over experiments is that they cover a representative sample of Americans, not just those who are eligible for housing vouchers. A disadvantage is that the results are often biased because of measurement problems (equation 2).\nA typical study estimates a version of equation 1 while ignoring measurement error on family background:\nA number of analysts attempt to control for family background using measurable characteristics such as parental education and income. In many cases, substantial correlations with youths' educational attainment remain (that is, the estimate of effects of peers, b 1 , is large even after controlling for many observable features of the family. As the number of controls rises, the effect of the school or neighborhood typically declines and sometimes loses statistical significance (Brooks-Gunn, Duncan, and Aber, 1997) .\nWhile interesting, these cross-sectional analyses are unable to disentangle why youths' academic and social success are correlated within a neighborhood (Manski, 1995) . Coefficient estimates from equation 3 are subject to two important problems. First, because family background is measured with error, the coefficient b 2 is biased down.\nSecond, family background and school and neighborhood quality are positively correlated. Thus, mismeasurement of family background biases the coefficient on the average test scores upward. While acknowledging these important problems, a number of scholars have estimated versions of equation 3 (e.g., Gaviria and Raphael, 2001; BrooksGunn, Duncan, and Aber, 1997 ; many others have estimated versions in first-difference form).\nIn spite of these limitations, our first set of results follows this method, taking advantage of the uniquely rich measures of family background in the NELS dataset.\nThus, if the estimated effect of peers (b 1 ) diminishes substantially when we move from a standard set of controls to the richer set of measures, it is likely that continued improvements in measures of family background may eliminate the estimated effects of neighborhoods and schools."}, {"section_title": "Incremental Sorting between 8 th and 10 th Grade", "text": "To address the potential biases due to sorting, we need to examine how students are allocated to schools and neighborhoods. Most youths continue on from a junior high school to the main high school it feeds into. The families of some youths move between 8 th and 10 th grades, enrolling their children in new neighborhood schools. Some youths do not move with their classmates to a junior high's main high school even when their families remain in the same location because they enroll in a nearby private or specialized public high school. Still others may move from a private junior high to a nearby public school. The samples for our next analyses consist of youths who did not continue to the main high school fed by their junior high schools."}, {"section_title": "A first look at sorting", "text": "While the standard method described above looks for evidence of school effects, a complementary analysis examines the extent of sorting. Consider the extreme model where school rejects are solely due to sorting but there is some random error in the initial allocations of students to schools. In this case, when a child moves from school 1 to school 2 , the child and his or her family would already look like the students at school 2 . In contrast, consider the extreme circumstance where some families move randomly to other schools. In this instance, the child would be no more like his or her new classmates in school 2 than like his or her former classmates at school 1 .\nTo see whether the data approximate either of these extreme cases, we look at how much youths who do not attend their junior high school's main high school resemble students at their new school (Quality ActualHS ), and at how much they resemble the students in the school they would have attended if they had stayed with most of their classmates (Quality MainHS Tables A2 and A3, and standard errors are in parentheses.) This suggests that sorting is important, and below we incorporate this insight in a more formal approach."}, {"section_title": "Instrumental Variables Approach", "text": "More formally, when families move, we assume that parents consider the academic qualifications of their children in choosing a new home. In fact, a poor match between a youth's achievement and that of his or her classmates may help motivate some voluntary moves. We also assume that the quality of the student-school match contributes to the decision to start or stop paying for private school. At the same time, we assume that many factors that led to imperfect matches continue to hold; for example, parents with strong opinions about the importance of school quality will continue to hold those opinions.\nThese scenarios imply that, on average, youths who do not attend their neighborhood's main high school end up with a better match between their true family background and their high school quality than if they had continued on to the main high school. Thus, high school quality (Quality* HS ) is an average of true junior high quality and family background, as well as random shocks, v i :\nWe use this model of sorting between junior high and high school in the estimation strategy outlined below. Below we also discuss how the model is affected by changes in family characteristics (for example, if the parents divorce) or academic ability (as measured by test scores), as well as the quality of a student's high school.\nGiven the measurement problems that plague the estimation of equation 3, several researchers have searched for instrumental variables. The challenge here is to find a factor that is correlated with neighborhood quality, but is not correlated with the family background or unmeasured variables that affect the outcome measure. Although each of the instrumental variable studies has much to recommend it, none passes this stringent test completely convincingly.\nFor example, Evans and his co-authors (1992) have instrumented for neighborhood quality using metropolitan-level variables. Using the assumption that parents choose neighborhoods but not metropolitan areas, they have found no significant neighborhood effects. At the same time, the validity of their instruments is open to question. As Duncan and Raudenbush (2001) have noted, the procedures require that characteristics of the city and metropolitan area must not influence youths' success. In addition, the procedures may lead to biased results if families choose their metropolitan area in part on the basis of average school or neighborhood quality. Aaronson (1998) and Plotnick and Hoffman (1999) have used the difference in neighborhoods that sisters live in to identify the portion of neighborhood effects not due to omitted family characteristics. In some, but not all, specifications they have found that, in the PSID, a sister who spent more of her life living in a relatively advantaged neighborhood had a higher rate of high school graduation. The difficulty with this approach is that many families live in more than one neighborhood type while their children are adolescents. Moreover, families that move to quite different neighborhoods are often motivated by events such as divorce that have independent effects on youths' outcomes. Thus precision was often low, and results changed with modest changes in specification.\nLike Aaronson (1998) and Plotnick and Hoffman (1999) , we use information from school changers to distinguish the effects of family background from those of the neighborhood. Like these studies, our sample for identification includes only \"movers.\"\nIn our procedure, movers include both youths whose families change residence between junior high and high school and youths who do not attend the high school most of their junior high classmates attend.\nIn our instrumental variable approach, our identification strategy is the converse of Aaronson's (1998) and of Plotnick and Hoffman's (1999) . They use the fact that neighborhood location is partly causal (net of family background) to identify the true effect of location. We use the fact that high school quality is due partly to family background (net of junior high effects) to identify the true effect of family background.\nImportantly, we use information about the schools that youths do not yet attend; this implies that high school quality measures only family background, not the causal effect of schools and neighborhoods.\n3 In a related study, control for neighborhood fixed effects and look at average differences in youths' behavior over time;\nwe control for junior high school and neighborhood effects and look at individual changes in neighborhood and junior high surroundings.\nOur identification strategy uses the same source of identifying variation used by Gaviria and Raphael (2001) . Gaviria and Raphael (2001, table 5) find that youths who move to a new high school report smoking, using drugs, and other behaviors at roughly similar rates to students in the new high school. They interpret this result as mixed evidence of sorting (which they associate with a higher correlation for movers than for those who stay). In contrast, we read their evidence as consistent with substantial incremental sorting between junior high school and high school, in that youths not yet attending a high school already resemble those who will be their future peers. Throughout this paper, we study the influence of school-based interactions on a sample of junior high school students. In contrast, much of the literature on peer effects analyzes neighborhoods, often measured for convenience by census tracts. Schools are more natural units of analysis young teens spend many of their waking hours at school and much of their free time with peers who are also classmates. For example, Gaviria and Raphael (2001) document the importance of within-school friendships in the NELS dataset we study. To the extent that students who live near each other attend different schools, it is likely that their parents' priorities and their own capabilities and preferences are more similar to those of their classmates than to those of their neighbors. For example, a student at an elite private school probably has more in common with and is more influenced by his or her classmates than by neighbors. Moreover, his or her parents probably have more in common with his or her classmates' parents than with neighbors.\nBelow we refer to school and neighborhood effects interchangeably because school and neighborhood go together for the vast majority of the sample; thus our measures cannot distinguish the individual effects of the two sets of influences."}, {"section_title": "Identifying family background", "text": "While the previous three tests are intended to be interesting and descriptive, we now add more structure to the model. Under the assumptions we outline, our strategy will lead to consistent estimates of the causal effects of neighborhoods.\nBecause many youths move to a high school that fits their characteristics more closely than did their junior high's main high school (as in equation 5), high school quality is a potential instrument for family background. To see that our measure of high school quality, Quality HS , is an appropriate instrument, note that it correlates with our measure of family background (FB i ) on the assumption that students who do not attend the high school of their junior high peers partially sort themselves in the years between 8 th and 10 th grade (equation 5). That is, students who appeared advantaged relative to their junior high classmates on average attend above-average high schools. We will show that this correlation holds in the data.\nHigh school quality must also correlate with true family background (FB * i ) but not with measurement error on family background (u i ); that is, as is assumed in equation 5, we need sorting to reflect true family background, not merely the observable portion of it. This assumption is plausible, given the positive correlations of high school quality and observable family background that we report below.\nLess obviously, we need Quality HS to be uncorrelated with academic ability that is not due to school quality or family background (e i : equation 1). This assumption would not hold, for example, if high-achieving students (given their observable characteristics) were more frequently accepted into and given scholarships to selective high schools.\nWe performed two analyses that suggest this potential problem is not serious.\nFirst, we estimated the sorting equation 5 and included an estimate of e i (specifically, the residual from estimating equation 3 using our index of observable family background, FB i ). The coefficient on the residual was small and not significant. Second, we reran all analyses, dropping students who attend high schools that are most likely to be selective (specifically, private high schools that are not Catholic). This restriction never affected the results."}, {"section_title": "Catch-up at new schools", "text": "If the estimated effects of school quality are largely causal, then the test scores and other outcomes of a youth's move to a new school should quickly converge to the outcomes of the youths already there. Intuitively, if a student attends a somewhat better high school (in terms of academic achievement) and quickly attains the academic level of his or her new classmates, it appears that school effects are largely causal. We estimate the changes in test scores of students who do not attend the same high school attended by most of their junior high classmates: Hanushek and his colleagues (forthcoming) report a similar specification.\nConsistent with the theory we present here, they find significant catch-up among students who move to a new school of markedly higher or lower quality than their previous school. Their very large sample permits them to look at the effect of the changes in the test scores of peers (by using variation in classmates who move in addition to those who simply change schools). Moreover, they find convergence when new students arrive in an existing school, in that students who do not change schools have test scores that slowly converge with those of their new classmates.\nA youth's test scores could appear to converge with those of his or her new classmates regardless of the effects of peers and a new school if the move to a new school is due to a shock to the student's family. For example, if parental divorce leads to a job loss, then a family may move to a less advantaged neighborhood and a youth may not learn as much in high school; this correlation would not necessarily be due to the neighborhood change. Thus we rerun these results on families without a divorce or remarriage and control for changes in family income.\nThe tests in this section are based on the assumption that if schools and neighborhoods have a largely causal effect on a youth, then a youth moving to a new high school should rapidly begin to perform like the youths who are already there.\nWe first examine the sample of youths who do not attend their junior high school's main high school using the model in equation 6. We regress 12 th grade test scores on 8 th grade test scores, an index of the student's current high school characteristics, and an index of the main high school characteristics (the school attended by most former classmates).\nThe results are consistent with catch-up in test scores (Table 5) . If a youth's high school is two standard deviations better than his or her junior high, the youth typically gains about one-third of a standard deviation unit in test scores between 8 th and 12 th grades (P < .01).\nWe can perform a back-of-the-envelope calculation to compare these results with those in the first method. Assume the effect of school quality on test scores is linear with years of exposure to a better school and that the effect size is similar in all grades. Using these strong assumptions, we can compare this effect size with that of the first method in Table 3 , where we looked at the variation in school fixed effects while controlling for a rich set of family background variables. The results in Table 5 It is possible that the larger results in Texas are due to the younger age of that sample."}, {"section_title": "Case-control matching", "text": "It is possible that schools have different effects on youth with different ability and achievement levels (as measured by test scores). For example, a small high school might be best for the average child in a junior high, but might not have the enrichment or advanced courses that are important for the best students and that are only available at a large high school. To see if these factors are important, we match each youth with a student who has very similar academic achievement in 8 th grade.\nFor each child who left a junior high, we chose another child in that junior high with the closest test scores in eighth grade. We then ran the case-control regression controlling for which child moved away from the main high school (mover j ) fed by that junior high j: \nwhere X is the vector including family income, parental education, and so forth.

NELS was designed to provide trend data about critical transitions experienced by young people as they develop, attend school, and embark on their careers.\nThe base year (1988) survey was a multifaceted study with questionnaires for students, teachers, parents, and the school.\nSampling was first conducted at the school level and then at the student level within schools. The data were drawn from a sample of 1,000 schools (800 public schools and 200 private schools, including parochial institutions). The three follow-ups revisited (most of) the same sample of students in 1990, 1992, and 1994 ; that is, when the respondents were typically in the 10 th grade, in the 12 th grade, and roughly two years after high school graduation. We use data from the 1988 and 1990 surveys, and obtain a sample of approximately 14,000 students. After dropping students from junior high schools in which there were too few students, we use a sample of 11,939 for the analysis. [by choosing a specific high school]. Nevertheless, in the 1990 survey, the majority of students from each junior high attended a common high school. Many forces ranging from the transaction costs of selling a home to the costs of changing jobs for parents to the social disruption parents and children suffer lead most parents not to move during the years when the focal youth is in 8 th to 10 th grade, even if the family-school match is imperfect. Thus we restrict our sample to \"movers,\" those youths who did not attend the main high school.\nWe first identified junior high schools in which a plurality attended a single high school but at least one student attended a different high school. 5 We termed this high school the main high school. Drawn from these junior highs, our sample consists of the youths who did not attend the main high school. In addition, we dropped junior highs with fewer than eight students because we were not certain of being able to correctly identify the main and alternative high schools in this sample."}, {"section_title": "Socioeconomic status and family background:", "text": "In the construction of the index of family background, a number of variables are used that previous research has determined are important predictors of youths' educational attainment and behavior.

The set of variables includes occupational status (using Duncan's index), parental education, and family income. These variables are converted into z-scores with mean zero and standard deviation equal to one. When there are missing values for parental education because of a missing parent, these are given a z-score of 0, and categorical variables are included to note these missing values.

These variables proxy for how close-knit a family is and for the social capital available to the children. We also controlled for whether the mother was a teen when the student was born.

Controlling for the standard measures found in the census such as race and family income reduces that coefficient to 0.61 (Table 3 , col. 2). These additional controls raise the R 2 of the regression from 11 to 26 percent, which is large but leaves substantial variation in individual test scores unaccounted for.\nMany analysts have hypothesized that this residual variance is due to unobserved family background. The key question is whether additional measures of family background would make a difference. When we add 24 additional controls, the R 2 rises to 31 percent and the coefficient on peer test scores declines to .56. The rise in R 2 is statistically significant, while the decline in the point estimate on peer test scores is not.\nThe coefficient on peer test scores remains very large and highly statistically significant (t > 14, P < .001). Thus, unlike in several previous studies, better measures of family background do not drive the coefficient on peer effects toward zero or statistical insignificance.\nEven with much better controls for family background than most past researchers have been able to use, substantial variation across schools remains.

Mean reversion in test scores will then show the advantaged youth to have higher average test score gains. To reduce the importance of such advantages, we used a within-school propensity score matching method. In the appendix, we describe this propensity score matching method, which matches each mover with one youth who remained at the main high school, with matching based on the predicted probability of attending the better high school. Results were very similar to results from the case-control matching."}, {"section_title": "Robustness Tests", "text": "In this section, we briefly describe robustness checks on the results above."}, {"section_title": "Are results from movers representative?", "text": "An important concern when studying just the population of movers is that they might be quite different from the population of those who continued on to the main high school. For example, consider a population where 10 percent move every other year and 90 percent rarely move. For the frequent movers, current school characteristics are poor proxies for the schools and neighborhoods they have lived in their whole lives. For this group, more than for the geographically stable group, family background proxies for past peer effects. Thus, in equation 3, the estimated family background effect should be larger and the current school effect should be smaller for the frequent movers. Moreover, if we look at moves after 10th grade (for example, between 10th and 12th grade), those who moved between 8th and 10th grade will be far more likely to move than those who did not move in the previous two years (35 vs. 11 percent). Further, it is possible that those families that do not expect their children to be affected by a neighborhood may choose relatively disadvantaged neighborhoods (Duncan and Raudenbush, 1999) . If this is true for our sample of non-school changers, then our results would overstate the neighborhood effects on the typical youth.\nIn short, while selection bias remains a concern, the sample we analyze does not appear to self-select visibly in a way that would lead to unrepresentative coefficients. Not only are the family backgrounds similar among stayers and school changers, as discussed earlier; in addition, the effects of observed average junior high school test scores and family background in predicting test scores (equation 3) were similar for movers and stayers (Table 4 , cols. 1 and 2)."}, {"section_title": "Sampling error on test scores", "text": "Because the NELS samples roughly 25 students per junior high, these school means have sampling error. To address this problem, we used the mean from half the sample as an instrument for the mean from the other half. This instrumental variable technique does nothing to solve the causality problems related to mismeasured family background but should reduce mismeasurement of test scores and, thus, mismeasurement of the effects of school and neighborhood quality. With this technique the coefficient on school mean test scores increases by about 20-25%, but the pattern of the results is the same as reported in the rest of the paper."}, {"section_title": "Standard method", "text": "Instead of using a school's average test scores, we can use a fixed effect to capture school and neighborhood variation. Table 3 : richer measures of family background do not eliminate the between-school variation we observe. Solon and Page (1999) note that much of the estimated relationship between neighborhood and child outcomes is dependent on which metropolitan area one comes from. Their point estimates indicate that neighborhoods play a small role. At the same time, their estimates are not precise and cannot rule out rather large neighborhood effects.\nWe reran our results on equation 1 separately for rural and urban regions, and they were roughly unchanged. As a robustness check, we reran all results below (results available on request), omitting youths who moved from private Catholic junior high to a public high school; the results were unchanged.\nOne final concern is that some youths moved from private junior high schools to public high schools to take advantage of the public schools' larger size and, thus, higher number of advanced classes. For example, even if the mean test score of a public high school is the same as or lower than that of the corresponding private high school, if the public school is larger, its highest-scoring students may have even higher test scores than the private school's, as well as more advanced classes for this upper tail. Such sorting would call into doubt our one-dimensional metric of school quality, because students with different academic backgrounds might have very different experiences at one large high school. In contrast to this hypothesis, students were no more likely to move to a school that had more advanced placement (AP) classes."}, {"section_title": "Instrumental variables estimation", "text": "For the instrumental variables estimation, we restricted our sample to junior high schools with larger samples (10 or 12 per junior high), instead of using a cutoff point of 8. As noted above, we restricted the sample to students who did not attend selective high schools (specifically, we eliminated private schools unless they were Catholic). Again, the results were unchanged.\nThe junior high average test scores were from a sample of students, not from the student body as a whole. This sampling error can attenuate the bias of the coefficient on average test scores. Using the mean from half the sample to instrument for the mean test score from the other half can resolve the problem. When we implemented this correction for sampling error, the results were almost unchanged.\nA youth's test scores and his or her junior high's average test scores can be correlated by common measure bias. For example, a high-quality school may deemphasize skills measured with paper-and-pencil tests. In that case, both a student's scores and that of his or her peers will be misleadingly low (given family background), and the coefficient on average test scores in a junior high may be biased down. Working in the other direction, the average test score is from a sample within each school, and sampling error tends to cause a downward attenuation bias.\nIt is possible to solve both problems if we use characteristics of the junior high school (the proportion poor, with single-parent families, etc.) as instruments for average test scores. Unfortunately, using these instruments can introduce new biases if characteristics of the junior high correlate with unmeasured family background. In that case, the instruments will be imperfect, and a modest amount of failure of the assumptions of instrumental variable estimation can lead to large biases (Bound, Jaeger, and Baker, 1995) . In any case, the results were unchanged using a list of characteristics of the junior high school to instrument for average test scores.\nAs we described above, some school changes between 8 th and 10 th grades may be due to students' achievement in 8th grade, which, for example, allowed them to enroll in selective high schools. This selection of schools should be less important if family changes such as divorce or getting a new job led to the move. Perhaps due to our limited sample size of movers, results were not statistically distinguishable when we divided the sample by the distance of the move (same city vs. new city) or by the cause of the move (when we could identify divorce, job change, or job loss).\nWe repeated this analysis on a number of other youth outcomes, such as having behavioral problems reported by teachers or parents, and self-reported cigarette smoking and drug use. We found that the same methodology that we applied to test scores did not apply to any of these outcomes. While the coefficient on the school-wide average of each behavior was statistically significant, the coefficient on the index of family background was not. This result suggests that sorting is not important for these outcomes. These results support Gaviria and Raphael's (2001) interpretation of their finding that youths engaging in a number of undesirable behaviors in 10th grade tended to be enrolled in the same school. That is, if observable family background does not predict these behaviors, then unobserved family background probably has a weak relationship as well. Even though Gaviria and Raphael (2001) did not explicitly account for sorting based on family background, their results are not substantially biased."}, {"section_title": "Catch-up", "text": "We entered lagged test scores as a control variable in the regression and the results were unchanged. Because students who change schools score lower on standardized tests in the year after the move (as documented by Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin, 2001 ), we dropped families that moved in the twelve months prior to the second test administration. The results were unchanged."}, {"section_title": "Alternative measures of test scores", "text": "The tests above used the combined reading and math scores as a composite test score. We reran all tests on the reading and math subscores; the results were similar."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We have used three different measures of the role of schools and neighborhoods.\nEach is subject to biases typically because we can never identify all the forms of family background that might affect the school a youth attends. At the same time, the methods use quite different sources of identification and do not all suffer from that main bias.\nThus, together they provide a fairly convincing collage of evidence that schools and neighborhoods do, in fact, matter substantially for youths."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "Controlling for a good measure of family background, a one standard deviation increase in school test scores raises a student's test scores by 0.52 standard deviations (Table 4 , col. 2). To the extent that unmeasured family background is correlated with neighborhood quality, this estimate partly captures the effects of both. Thus the coefficient is likely to be biased upward. Importantly, most causal theories of neighborhood effects imply this bias is guaranteed to be present, because the true school effects are due largely to the sorting of families.\nOur first method asks whether better measures of family background would make a difference. The answer here is clear: Even with far more detailed information about the family than economists usually analyze, school effects are measured as having essentially the same magnitude as when only the standard controls are used.\nOur next test uses an identification strategy and instrument that allows a more precise estimate of family background than previous studies. The cost of this precision is the need for very strong structural assumptions. This technique implies that the causal effect of a one standard deviation increase in peer test scores is about 0.42 (Table 4 , col.\n3). On the one hand, this effect is substantially smaller than the 0.52 estimated in column 2. On the other hand, the estimate is substantively large and suggests neighborhoods do matter, if somewhat less than standard estimates indicate.\nOur final method asks whether youths who move to a better high school than most of their peers \"catch up\" with the academic achievement of their new high school peers.\nUsing both standard regression methods and matching techniques, we find substantial catch-up -our most direct evidence that schools and neighborhoods matter."}, {"section_title": "Implications", "text": "Many readers will already have made important decisions based on the intuition underlying these results. For example, many parents pay substantial amounts to live in neighborhoods with advantaged neighbors. Presumably, higher-cost real estate reflects the ideals of better schools, better peers, and better role models for their children. If the estimated neighborhood outcomes are completely noncausal, such amenities are valueless; that is, the children's expected achievements would be unchanged if they grew up in a much less advantaged neighborhood. Moreover, urban policies such as the Moving to Opportunity program focusing on deconcentrating the poor would not help poor youths (see the citations in Ludwig et al., 2001; and Katz et al., 2000, for descriptions of this program). (Manski, 1995) . Finally, schools can matter if school and parental policies and institutions are effective. Our estimated school effect captures the sum of these forces. It is left for future research to measure the importance of each channel and to identify cost-effective policies that will improve the lives of all youths. Notes: ** and * represent statistically significantly different from zero at the 1 and 5 percent levels. Standard errors are in parentheses. They are estimated taking into account the complex sampling structure of the data. The family background index is described in Table A1 .\nIn column 3, measures of (future) high school quality are used as instruments for family background. The first stage is presented in Table A2 in the appendix. The instruments are categorical variables that measure the proportion of the high school student body who receive a free lunch, are non-minority, are from a single-parent household, and speak English as a second language, and the proportion of the previous year's 12th grade class that dropped out, entered a four-year college, or entered a two-year college. Notes: ** and * represent statistically significantly different from zero at the 1 and 5 percent levels. Standard errors are in parentheses. The school quality indices are computed from school and family characteristics such as the proportion receiving a school lunch. Details are in Table A3 in the appendix. The sample in column 3 is movers (youth who did not attend their junior high school's main high school) and, for each mover, the youth in the same junior high with the most similar test scores. Table 5 . ** represents different from zero at the 1 percent level. * represents different from zero at the 5 percent level. Q This variable is measured on a 0-3 scale (0 = none, 1 = 0-10%, 2 = 11-50%, 3 = 51-100%). "}, {"section_title": "Appendix: Propensity Score Matching", "text": "Case-control matching captures much of the variation we are interested in; but it does not match for multiple factors, such as parental education and income, youth race and gender, and so forth. In a remarkable result, Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) show that matching on a single index they call the propensity score can achieve all the benefits of matching on all controls. The propensity score is constructed by estimating the probability that a particular youth receives the \"treatment\" -in this case, moving to the better high school (also see Dehejia and Wahba, 2002.) Heckman, Ichimura, and Todd (1997) emphasize the importance of matching within a geographic region to control for unobserved aspects of the labor market, while Levine and Painter (2002) emphasize the advantages of matching within a school to also capture unobserved aspects of the school and neighborhood. Thus, we follow the latter in matching within a junior high school.\nFor each youth who did not attend the main high school, we created a small sample consisting of that youth and all youth from that junior high who did attend the main high school. We merged all of these small samples. Thus, a youth who attended the main high school from a school that sent several youths to other high schools appears more than once in the larger sample. We then created a dummy equal to 1 if the youth attended the best high school in his sample; that is, if the mover went to a better high school, this dummy is 1 only for the mover. If the mover went to the worst high school, this dummy is one for everyone but the mover.\nIn this large sample we ran a conditional (fixed-effect) logit, with a separate fixed effect for each subsample predicting that student j is the one from junior high i who attends the better of the two (main or other) high schools (T ij = 1). Table A1. For each junior high, we then identified the youth who attended the main high school whose propensity score (that is, the predicted probability of being at the better high school) was closest to the propensity score of the youth who moved. We used this closest match as the control person for that mover. We then analyzed test score growth by the senior year of high school for each mover and each control from junior high i: where Better School j = 1 if student i was the one from school j to attend the better high school.\nTo keep the matches close in terms of test scores, we discard any mover who had no junior high classmate with less than a 0.1 gap in the predicted probability of attending the better high school. (Results were robust to several cutoffs.) As with case-control matching, four years later the student who ended up at the better high school had standardized test scores .09 higher (SE = .02, Table A5 , col. 1) than the control.\nOn average, the better of the two high schools had about .33 higher predicted test scores (our measure of high school quality estimated in Table A3 ). Thus, students who move to a new high school close about one-fourth of the gap in initial test scores between themselves and their new classmates. That ratio is also what we estimate if we replace the dummy variable for which student attended the better high school with the index of high school quality (Table A5 , col. 2).\nResults are robust to several variations in matching. The pace of convergence for students who moved to a better high school is also similar to that for students who moved to a worse high school. Notes: ** and * represent statistically significantly different from zero at the 1 and 5 percent levels. Variables marked (z) are z-scored to have a mean of zero and standard deviation of one. The dataset from this regression includes each student who did not attend the main high school and each student who did. The regression includes a fixed effect for each student who moved and the pool of students who continued from their junior high to the main high school."}]
