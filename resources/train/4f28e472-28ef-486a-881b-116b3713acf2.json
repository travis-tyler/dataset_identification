The microstrucutural changes observed in the WM of AD patients include axonal deterioration, Wallerian degeneration, loss of myelin density, loss of oligodendrocytes, microglia activation and vascualar degeneration [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] . Numerous studies have shown that changes in the WM 5 are an early event in the development of AD, happening in preclinical stages [3, 8, 9] . Changes in the microstructure of WM have even been reported before measurable hippocampal atrophy in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [10] and preclinical AD [11] . More recent evidence shows that chronic neuroinflammation also contributes to the process of neurodegeneration in AD and was recently observed in the WM of AD patients [12] . 10 Microglia-induced neuroinflamation in patients have been mostly studied using PET imaging ligands such as 11C-PK11195 [13] . However, to identify WM changes, diffusion MRI has been the modality of choice [14] . Studies, in the past decade, have identified various regions in the WM where the diffusion measures, mostly diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based measures such as fractional anisotropy and mean, axial, and radial diffusivities, correlate with symptoms of MCI and AD [15, 16, 15 17, 18, 19] . A more recent diffusion measure is the free water (FW) index, which measures the fraction of the diffusion signal explained by isotropically unconstrained water [20] , as estimated from a regularized bi-tensor model. In white matter, this measurement represents either FW in extracellular space around axons or FW contamination from cerebrospinal fluid in adjacent voxels. An elevated FW index in white matter has been suggested to indicate neuroinflammation [21] and has been 20 described in normal aging [22] and many neurological disorders such as schizophrenia [23, 24, 25] , Parkinson's disease [26] , and AD [27, 28, 29] .\nIn AD patients, an association between the widespread increased FW and poorer attention, executive functioning, visual construction, and motor performance was shown in [28, 29] . FWcorrected DTI measures are more sensitive to differentiate AD groups compared to standard DTI 25 measures [29] . In a longitudinal study, FW-corrected radial diffusivity, but not un-corrected radial 2 diffusivity, was higher in the WM of MCI patients who converted to AD compared to MCI patients who did not convert [27] . FW-corrected DTI measures also demonstrate greater sensitivity to associations between AD pathology and white matter microstructure compared to standard DTI measures [11] . 30 In this study, we developed a FW processing pipeline that uses a WM \"safe\" mask (W M safe ) without GM/CSF partial volume contamination and computed new and simple whole-brain FW measures based on this W M safe mask (including and excluding WMHs within the mask) for three different groups (cognitively normal, MCI and AD subjects), selected from the ADNIGO and ADNI2 databases. The prevalence and degree of WMHs is known to increase with age [30] and therefore 35 WMHs cannot be ignored in WM processing of aged groups. We show that our FW measures were significantly higher in MCI and AD groups compared to NC, but only when using a WM safe mask.\nWe also show, for the first time, that when WMHs are removed from the mask, the significant results remained, which demonstrates that FW measures are not just a byproduct of WMHs. All participants had good general health, good hearing and seeing abilities, no depression or bipolar condition, no history of alcohol or drug abuse and completed at least six grades of education. Also, NCs had no memory impairment and their clinical dementia rating (CDR) was 0. MCI subjects 50 included early and late MCI with impaired memory and a CDR of 0.5, while AD subjects met criteria for dementia and had a CDR between 0.5 and 1 [31] . Participants did not suffer from any neurological disorders other than MCI and AD such as brain tumor, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, or traumatic brain injury. Of the available modalities, we used the T1w, diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) scans. The DWI scans were acquired along 41 evenly distributed directions using a b-value of 1000 s/mm 2 with a 1.3 \u00d7 1.3 \u00d7 2.7 mm 3 spatial resolution. The T1w 65 and FLAIR scans were acquired at 1.2 \u00d7 1.05 \u00d7 1.05 and 0.85 \u00d7 0.85 \u00d7 5 mm 3 spatial resolution, respectively. Data was acquired at 58 different North-American locations."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "MRI data acquisition", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "MRI processing pipeline", "text": "The processing pipeline is illustrated in Figure 1 . At first, the T1w and DW images were denoised with a non-local means method robust to Rician noise [32], followed by an MRI bias field correction performed with ANTs N4 correction tool [33] . The brain mask (BM) was then processed and the skull was removed using the BEaST brain extraction software [34] . We referred to these methods as the preprocessing step in Figure 1 . Then, the T1w and FLAIR images were nonlinearly registered to the 1x1x1 up-sampled diffusion space with ANTs registration [33] . Tissue segmentation was then performed on the transformed T1w to obtain a binary map of the CSF, GM, and WM. This was done using ANTs Atropos [33] . In order to prevent any CSF contamination in regions susceptible to partial volume effect, a \"safe WM mask\" (W M safe ) was built by combining the following morphological operations on the CSF, WM, GM and brain binary masks:\nwhere R n is a 3D structuring element of radius n, \u2295 is the dilatation operator, is the erosion operator and \u2229 the intersection operator as illustrated in Figure 1 .

A log transformation was applied to the rFW and \u00b5FW metrics to improve normality of the distribution before analyses [39] . in the DWI images causing improbable values in metrics and one with an obviously incorrect T1 brain mask, leaving 226 subjects with usable data for the group analysis."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "As shown in Table 1 To represent the spatial differences in free water repartition between groups, every T1W image 110 already registered in diffusion space was non-linearly registered to the MNI152 space with the ANTs registration tool [33] .

These z-score volumes were averaged and thresholded at z \u2265 2 standard deviations to obtain binary group comparison volumes."}, {"section_title": "115", "text": "In both the NC vs AD and NC vs MCI comparisons, the voxels showing differences are mostly located in the corticospinal tract (CST) and bundles of the limbic system such as the cingulum and the fornix.

We also demonstrated that the use of a safe WM mask is critically important to prevent partial volume contamination that can perturb the overall results. Our new and simple FW measures 7 can be used to increase our understanding of the role of inflammation-associated edema in AD and 125 may aid in the differentiation of healthy subjects from MCI and AD patients. Significant results were also obtained when WMHs were removed from the WM mask, which demonstrate that FW metrics differences between group were not due to white matter lesions that can be seen on T2 FLAIR images as WMHs. In fact, a key observation of this study is that FW in MCI and AD subjects is globally distributed through the WM and is not specifically associated to WMHs or other regions 130 typically associated to cognition like the limbic system.\nNeither FW metrics could differentiate between MCI and AD subjects. This result could be attributed to the study design since measuring FW metrics in non-specific anatomical brain region such as the whole WM gives a very broad picture of the FW content in the brain, which may hide localized differences. Analyzing FW content along specific WM bundles would be expected to yield 135 more specific results. To do so, tractography would then be used to reconstruct the global WM architecture followed by an automated segmentation of several key WM bundles such as the fornix, cingulum, corpus callosum, and association tracts (arcuate fasciculus, uncinate, inferior longitudinal and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus). FW metrics would be analyzed along those bundles, as done in apparent fiber quantification (AFQ) [40] and tract-profiling [41] . Future work would also include 140 looking at how FW correlates with abeta and tau data available in ADNI to further support the hypothesis that FW is a good correlate measurement of neuroinflammation.\nHowever, FW metrics also have limitations, i.e. they are derived from a bi-tensor model, which is limited to representing a FW compartment and a single fiber population. However, it is estimated that 66 to 90 percent of brain WM voxels contain at least two fiber populations [27, 28] . In those 145 voxels, the estimated contribution of the FW compartment is incorrectly estimated, since some signal arising from the fiber populations not fitted to the single fiber tensor will be assigned to the FW compartment. To correct this bias, a FW model accounting for more than one fiber population would need to be used to better fit the signal. While a more sophisticated model would certainly better characterize the information contained in the non-free-water portion of the signal and give more 150 accurate free water indices, these models require multi-shell DWI acquisitions which are unavailable in ADN2 and ADNIGO."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This study demonstrates that after removing partial volume contamination as well as WMHs lesions, the free water content of healthy looking white matter differentiates MCI and AD groups 155 8 from healthy subjects. Our method is based on existing DTI-like diffusion data, is atlas free, requires no registration with a reference brain, no PET scan, no tractography, has few tunable parameters, and takes a few minutes only of computation. The method is a simple but powerful approach that may be used in the context of patient selection and stratification for novel treatments that are aimed at treating or preventing inflammation components of AD using legacy or standard diffusion MRI 160 data. The significant differences of our FW metrics between NC and MCI as well as NC and AD may demonstrate the potential of FW as a tool to study neuroinflammation. We intend to extend this work with analyses of FW metrics in specific white matter bundles and sections of bundles. Also, characterization over time of our new FW metrics in an MCI population could help differentiate those older adults who will remain relatively stable and those who will progress to AD, which has 165 utility for patient selection and stratification of subjects in preclinical stages of AD."}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This research has been evenly funded by Imeka Solution inc. and Pfizer inc.
