It represents a pressing public health problem and major research priority. Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, representing 60% to 80% of the cases (Reitz and Mayeux, 2014) . AD gradually affects multiple components long before any clinical diagnosis including brain atrophies, cognitive decline in various functions (memory, language, orientation in space and time, etc.) and loss of autonomy in the daily living activities. There is currently no cure for AD although many novel compounds are under development. Natural history of AD and its progression are still misunderstood; yet their understanding constitutes a crucial step for the assessment of compounds, and more generally AD research. Theoretical schemes have been proposed to understand the disease taken as a whole, highlighting the expected dynamic and multidimensional aspects (Jack et al., 2013 ). Jack's scheme, which is now central in AD research, hypothesizes a sequence of alterations: mainly the accumulation of proteins in the brain (amyloid-\u03b2 and tau proteins), the atrophy of brain regions (e.g., hippocampus) and finally clinical manifestations with cognitive and functional declines on which the diagnosis of dementia currently relies. However, because of its complexity, such theoretical scheme is very difficult to translate into a statistical model as it necessitates to combine the dynamic and multidimensional aspects, and to properly explore the temporal relationships between dimensions.\nThe dynamic aspect of AD has been apprehended mostly using the linear mixed model theory with models that analyzed one dimension according to time and covariates (Hall et al., 2000; Amieva et al., 2008; Donohue et al., 2014) . One difficulty is that the dimension of interest is usually not directly observed but measured by a series of outcomes; for instance, cognition is usually measured by a battery of neuropsychological tests. ProustLima et al. (2006 ProustLima et al. ( , 2013 considered latent process models which distinguish a structural model for analyzing the unobserved quantity over time and equations of observations for linking the unobserved quantity to the observed outcomes.\nTo account for the multidimensional aspect of AD and understand how dimensions are inter-related, many contributions explored pre-determined relationships by examining change over time of one biomarker (e.g., cognitive measure) according to another observed biomarker (e.g., hippocampal initial volume or change) and assumed the latter was ob-served without measurement error (e.g. Landau et al. (2011); Han et al. (2012) ). This approach quantifies temporal relationships but it relies on a specific a priori determined sequence and does not consider all biomarkers as stochastic processes, which limits the interpretation and may induce biases. Some authors also proposed to use bivariate mixed models to dynamically model two dimensions and account for their correlation through correlated random effects (e.g., (Mungas et al., 2005; Robitaille et al., 2012) ). However such models remain descriptive; they do not rely on asymmetric temporal relationships between processes and thus do no allow causal interpretations.\nTemporal asymmetric relationships between processes have usually been apprehended with Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN) (Song et al., 2009 ). This approach extends the concept of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) (Greenland, 2000) to the dynamic case by modelling constant or time-varying temporal relationships between successive states of a network of processes. However, firstly time is usually too grossly discretized so that spurious temporal associations might appear as showed by Aalen et al. (2016) . Second, the trajectories of processes are not modelled over time. Finally, DBN quantify the association between successive levels of processes while a dynamic view of causality would seek local dependence structures linking the network of processes to its infinitesimal change over time (Aalen and Frigessi, 2007) .\nLocal dependence structures can be naturally investigated with mechanistic models which are dynamic models relating a system of processes over time using differential equations. Proposed in HIV studies (Prague et al., 2017) or cancer studies (Desm\u00e9e et al., 2017) , they allowed retrieving causal associations between disease components. Yet mechanistic models are numerically very demanding so that their application to complex diseases such as AD is compromised. In addition they require precise biological knowledge which lacks for AD.\nThe objective of this work is to propose a statistical model that simultaneously describes the dynamics of multiple dimensions involved in Alzheimer's disease and assess their temporal relationships similarly as in a mechanistic model but with much less numerical complexity. We consider a system of latent processes, each one representing a latent dimension possibly observed through one or several longitudinal markers. In contrast with mechanistic models, we rely on a discrete-time framework and define a set of difference equations to model the change over time of the system according to the previous state of the system. In addition, we account for individual differences through subject-specific covariates and random effects. As discretization can distort the causal interpretations of temporal relationships compared to a model in continuous time, we specifically evaluate the impact of discretization on the temporal influence structure in a simulation study. The methodology is applied to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database to explore the temporal structure between cerebral, cognitive and functional dimensions at different stages of AD."}, {"section_title": "Motivating Data", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

Our model aims to be a dynamic causal model in the spirit of mechanistic models. We relied on discrete time with difference equations rather than continuous time with differential equations to largely reduce the numerical problems, notably with a closed-form likelihood.\nWe fundamentally explored in this work temporal influences between dynamic processes and the causal interpretation of these influences has to be done with caution. We relied on the dynamic approach to causality notably developed by Aalen and Frigessi (2007) , Arjas and Parner (2004) , Didelez (2008) , Commenges and G\u00e9gout-Petit (2009) . There is also a large literature in statistics on the potential outcomes formalism introduced by Rubin (2005) ; it is however not adapted for modeling dynamic relationships between non-directly observed factors, which is the aim in this paper so we do not discuss this approach further.\nFollowing the dynamic approach to causality, we chose to analyze the changes of processes (as seeking local dependence structures) and defined causal relationships in a structural model, that is at a latent process level rather than at an observation level. One major simplifying assumption in our approach was the time discretization. Fundamentally, causal relationships are to be explored at an infinitesimal level and thus, a causal model is to be defined in continuous time (Commenges and G\u00e9gout-Petit, 2009; Aalen et al., 2016) . To assess whether we could claim the same type of interpretation as mechanistic models, we thus assessed in a simulation study the impact of the discretization of the underlying time-continuous causal structure; we found that the type-I error rates of the temporal influence parameters were not altered by the use of a model in discrete time, provided the discretization step remained small in regards with the dynamics of the disease under study.

Columns refer to the group (controls CN, Subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairments MCI and subjects diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease dAD). Rows refer to the dimensions (cerebral anatomy, cognitive ability and functional autonomy). discretization step was between 2 and 6 months while the disease progresses over decades (Amieva et al., 2008; Jack et al., 2013) . In addition to the assessment that the absence of causal associations could be retrieved in the discretized time, we also provided in supplementary material analytic approximate relationships between transition matrices defined in two discretization steps or in continuous time and discrete time. These relationships quantify the associations between temporal influence structures; they remain however approximate as they were found under the assumption that the model structure did not differ substantially between the two discretization steps. This assumption deserves more attention in future work.\nWe acknowledge that despite our intention to provide a dynamic causal model, causal interpretation still has too be made cautiously as in any causal model since it is always subject to a correct specification of the system and of the statistical model.\nThe estimation we proposed relies on the assumption that missing data, both intermittent and monotone, are missing at random. This assumption is realistic in ADNI 1 which had a very short follow-up (3 years max). However, in applications with a longer followup, and notably in population-based cohorts, such assumption might become restrictive and it will be probably necessary to account for the occurrence of informative clinical events, such as dementia and death in our context. This will be possible by extending our model to a joint analysis of times to event but probably at the price of additional numerical complexities. In addition, in studies on chronic diseases with a long follow-up, it is reasonable to assume that the temporal influence structure may evolve with time. Our model can handle this as shown in the simulations where the temporal influence structure was modelled according to time using regression splines. We did not consider however time-dependent temporal influence structures in the application due to the short follow up. In addition, our objective was to contrast the influence structures between clinical stages, and as such we rather included stage-specific intensities of transition.\nThe model was primarily motivated by the study of the multiple alterations involved in the dementia process in the elderly. Indeed, dementia is characterized by very long and progressive alterations in different cerebral and clinical dimensions. However, although there is a global agreement on the relevant dimensions in AD, their relationships are still poorly understood and a confusion persists between alterations due to normal aging and alterations due to pathological aging leading to dementia. Thanks to the ADNI data which included subjects at different clinical stages of dementia, we were able to exhibit the global structure of dependence between cerebral, cognitive and functional domains in normal aging characterized as expected by the cerebral structure which explains a part of the cognitive and functional changes, and the functional and cognitive changes which have bidirectional relationships. We also found out that the main evolution in this structure due to the pathological process towards dementia (in subjects with mild cognitive impairment or diagnosed with AD) was on cognitive functioning with some effect of cognitive functioning on change in cerebral structure in addition to its effect on change in functional structure. Such backward influence of cognition on anatomic structure may appear counterintuitive from a biological point of view. Yet, some studies showed that interventions made on cognitive functioning (e.g., literacy at adulthood) could induce an improvement in cerebral structure (Carreiras et al., 2009; Boyke et al., 2008) . This application which gives a first insight on the possibilities of this dynamic model, could be now refined by targeting specific brain regions (separating for instance cortical thicknesses from hippocampal volume) and specific cognitive functions (separating for instance episodic memory from executive functioning).\nAs a conclusion, we proposed here a new methodology that may help identify temporal structures in multivariate longitudinal data. Although motivated and applied in dementia context, this approach has some potential to address unsolved questions in many other chronic diseases where multiple processes are in play, and or time-dependent exposures are to be assessed."}, {"section_title": "Appendix A: Relationships between model components under different discretization steps", "text": "For computational reasons, the latent processes in the structural model are assumed to evolve in discrete time with a constant step \u03b4 which may vary depending on the application.
