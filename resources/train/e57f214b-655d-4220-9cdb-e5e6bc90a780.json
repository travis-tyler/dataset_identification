With >1 billion overweight and 300 million obese persons worldwide, it is crucial to understand the implications of carrying this very common allele for the health of our aging population. FTO is highly expressed in the brain and elevated body mass index (BMI) is associated with brain atrophy, but it is unknown how the obesity-associated risk allele affects human brain structure. We therefore generated 3D maps of regional brain volume differences in 206 healthy elderly subjects scanned with MRI and genotyped as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We found a pattern of systematic brain volume deficits in carriers of the obesity-associated risk allele versus noncarriers. Relative to structure volumes in the mean template, FTO risk allele carriers versus noncarriers had an average brain volume difference of \u22488% in the frontal lobes and 12% in the occipital lobes-these regions also showed significant volume deficits in subjects with higher BMI. These brain differences were not attributable to differences in cholesterol levels, hypertension, or the volume of white matter hyperintensities; these Q:3 difference levels were not detectably higher in FTO risk allele carriers versus noncarriers. These brain maps reveal that a commonly carried susceptibility allele for obesity is associated with structural brain atrophy, with implications for the health of the elderly.\nAlzheimer's Q:4 Disease Neuroimaging Initiative | body mass index | brain structure O besity is a major public health concern; it is associated with increased risk for type 2 diabetes, hypertension, stroke, and coronary heart disease (1) . Currently, there are >1 billion overweight and 300 million obese persons worldwide (2) . The elderly population is particularly vulnerable-40% of men and 45% of women over age 70 suffer from either obesity or type 2 diabetes (3) . In addition to increasing one's risk for poor cardiovascular health, obesity is a risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) (4) .\nObesity-and the most common and simplest clinical measure of adiposity, body mass index (BMI)-are highly genetically influenced, with genetic factors explaining 50-90% of the variance in BMI, although environmental influences are also important (5) . Recently, the genetic bases of obesity and BMI were demonstrated to be in part due to variants within the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene in three large independent studies (6) (7) (8) . These studies were somewhat surprising as they discovered a risk allele for obesity that is highly prevalent in the general population. A commonly inherited single-basepair change at single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs9939609 is associated with an \u223c1.2-kg higher weight, on average, in adults, and an \u223c1-cm greater waist circumference. Carriers of two copies of the risk-conferring variant (18% of Europeans) had a 1.67-fold increased risk of obesity and weighed on average 3 kg more than those not carrying the risk gene (7) . This risk polymorphism (7) has population frequencies of 46% in Western and Central Europeans, 51% in Yorubans (West African natives), and 16% in Chinese individuals (9) ; the effect of the allele on obesity in those with non-European genetic backgrounds is not yet clear (10) . Interestingly, the effect of FTO on BMI may be mediated through impaired responsiveness to satiety (11) .\nFTO has highest expression in the brain in humans, specifically in the cerebral cortex (7) . Whether expression changes in the hypothalamus after food deprivation is controversial (12) (13) (14) . Although the function of the FTO gene is not completely understood, homozygous knockouts from a large region including this gene are not viable, show craniofacial abnormalities, and have abnormal left-right asymmetry and abnormally programmed cell death (15, 16) . Duplication of a chromosomal region including FTO in humans leads to obesity and mental retardation (17) , and a loss-of-function mutation produces microcephaly and structural Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (www.loni.ucla.edu\\ADNI).

FTO encodes the 2-oxoglutaratedependent nucleic acid demethylase protein that localizes to the nucleus and catalyzes demethylation (14) .\nObesity is associated with detectable structural differences in the brain in cognitively healthy elderly subjects (19) and in younger adults (20) (21) (22) . In 94 healthy elderly subjects, BMI, fasting plasma insulin (FPI), and type 2 diabetes were strongly linked with frontal, temporal, and subcortical atrophy (19) . Obese subjects (BMI \u2265 30 kg/m 2 ) showed greatest brain tissue deficits, particularly in the frontal lobes, anterior cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, and thalamus when compared to subjects with normal BMI (18.5-25 kg/m 2 ). Another study using voxel-based morphometry showed gray matter deficits in the frontal lobes and postcentral gyri but enlarged volumes in the orbitofrontal white matter (21) . Higher BMI was also associated with neuronal and myelin abnormalities in the frontal lobes, using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (20) . Studies of aging monkeys confirm the effect of diet on brain structure. A calorically restricted diet, without malnutrition, reduced brain atrophy in aging monkeys (23) .\nFTO is associated with consistent differences in BMI and is highly expressed in the brain, so here we sought to characterize the effect of carrying the FTO risk allele on human brain structure and determine whether these brain differences were consistent with those seen in people with higher BMI. We applied tensor-based morphometry (TBM), a relatively novel method (24) (25) (26) , to generate 3D maps of whole brain volumetric differences in 206 cognitively healthy elderly subjects scanned with MRI and genotyped as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We hypothesized that we would find brain regions with structural deficits in subjects who carry the obesity-associated risk allele, in regions where lower brain tissue volumes were strongly correlated with higher BMI\nThis study investigates a previously uncharacterized effect of an obesity-associated risk allele on brain structure.\nEmbargoed white matter burden (WMB) was regressed against brain structure after controlling for both age and sex ( Fig. S2 ). See SI Text for details about how WMB was assessed. Subjects with higher WMB had significantly lower regional brain volumes in the frontal lobe and the precuneus brain regions (FDR q = 0.05 level, critical uncorrected P = 0.0016). With every unit increase in WMB, there was an estimated 10 Q:12 % reduction in brain tissue ( Fig. S2 , red colors) in a localized region in the frontal lobe and the precuneus brain region. At the edge of the ventricles, a 15-20% increase in ventricular volume is also observed; this effect includes some nonventricular voxels at the interface between the ventricles and brain tissue, due to partial volume effects that arise from the limited spatial resolution of the deformation fields. Ventricular expansion is due to widespread atrophy of the surrounding brain tissue (24, 28) .\nConjunction Analysis. A conjunction analysis (29) was used to separately test the hypotheses that (i) the FTO risk allele and BMI affect brain volume at the same locations and (ii) FTO and WMB affect brain volume at the same locations. The null hypothesis was rejected in case i, so we can be reasonably confident that there is an effect of both the FTO risk allele and BMI on the voxels colored in Fig. 3 (FDR q = 0.05, critical uncorrected P = 5.007 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ). Even so, the null hypothesis was not rejected in case ii, using an FDR correction for multiple comparisons. As we did not detect a significant volume difference from both the FTO risk allele and WMB at the same voxels, it is fair to speculate that the FTO effect on the brain is not completely attributable to microvascular white matter damage.\nWhereas the conjunction analysis shows that a subset of the FTO-associated brain regions is consistent with a subset of the BMI-associated brain regions, an additional regression analysis was conducted to determine if there were statistically significant brain regions related to carrying at least one risk allele of the FTO gene, after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI. There were no significant brain regions associated with the risk allele, after FDR correction at 5%; however, unthresholded maps of the regression coefficients ( Fig. S4 Lower) are consistent with the equivalent thresholded maps ( Fig. S4 Upper) also displayed in Fig. 1 . Additionally, BMI was correlated with brain volume in the different genotype groups (Fig. S5 ). Subject demographics (Table S2 ) and unstandardized beta maps are presented for each genotype group (Fig. S5 , first and second rows). In the nonrisk group, BMI was not statistically associated with brain volume after FDR correction at 5% ( Fig. S5 , fourth row).\nEmbargoed average volumes seen in the general population (of carriers and noncarriers). Subjects with higher BMI also showed brain volume deficits in frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobe regions and in the brainstem and cerebellum-areas identified in past obesity studies, including our own in an independent, nonoverlapping sample (19) . Greater WMB was also associated with an \u223c10% brain volume deficit in the frontal lobes and precuneus, where the percentage units are expressed in terms of the average volumes seen in the general population (of carriers and noncarriers). Even so, WMB did not explain the effect of the FTO risk allele on brain atrophy. Intriguingly, WMB was not statistically higher in FTO risk allele carriers than in noncarriers, and the effects of WMB and the FTO risk allele on brain atrophy were in different regions.\nWe investigated the genetic contribution to brain structure from a tagging SNP to verified obesity-associated risk alleles and found deficits in largely the same brain regions where higher BMI is associated with lower tissue volumes. Volume deficits within the frontal lobes, which reached 8% here in FTO risk allele carriers ( Fig. 1) , have been associated with decreased executive functioning (30) . Further, individuals with obesity have generally poorer executive function than their healthy counterparts (31) (32) (33) .\nTemporal lobe atrophy was detected in subjects with higher BMI but not in subjects who carry the obesity-associated risk allele (Figs. 1-3). Other studies have found that midlife BMI is associated with temporal lobe atrophy 24 years later, suggesting that BMI is correlated with future differences in brain structure (34) . Temporal lobe structures, including the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, are among the earliest affected by neurofibrillary tangle pathology in Alzheimer's disease. FTO effects may either not target the temporal lobe or not be detectable in our sample due to the limited sample size. The obesity-associated risk allele may have different effects on brain structure in elderly versus younger groups; further studies are necessary to clarify this.\nThe occipital lobe volume deficits in subjects with greater BMI and those who carry one or more copies of the obesity-associated risk allele are clearly evident ( Figs. 1-3 ). BMI effects on occipital lobe tissue were found previously (19, 22, 34) . Studies of types 1 and 2 diabetes have also shown that diabetes is associated with greater brain atrophy. One study reported that patients with diabetic retinopathy, a complication of type 1 diabetes, showed reduced gray matter density in the inferior frontal gyrus and right occipital lobe when compared patients without retinopathy (35) . Patients with type 2 diabetes also had 3% less gray matter and \u223c17% increase in CSF in the parieto-occipital region (36) .\nFor the subjects examined in this study (Table 1) , neither hypertension nor cholesterol levels were statistically different on the basis of presence of the FTO risk allele; therefore, we do not have evidence to suggest FTO risk alleles increase the odds for some of the symptoms associated with metabolic syndrome; this Q:14 result counters the notion that the FTO risk allele might be merely a surrogate indicator of having symptoms often associated with metabolic syndrome. An important finding is that, between the two genetic groups of FTO carriers and noncarriers in our sample, there were no intergroup statistical differences in cholesterol, serum glucose levels, diabetes, or MRI-based measures of white matter burden. The FTO effects are not therefore merely reflecting some more fundamental difference in these parameters, at least when measured at the time of the scan. Even so, it cannot be ruled out that FTO may be associated with a different natural history of cholesterol or glucose levels in the past, even though such a relationship was not detectable at the time of the scan. As these factors are also related to mortality, given the old age of the participants studied here, we may have sampled a somewhat restricted range of natural histories for these risk factors. In conclusion, the FTO effects cannot be dismissed as reflecting the more conventionally studied risk factors assessed at the time of the scan, but FTO could be associated with these risk factors at other times throughout life or in other populations.\nPrevious studies relating the level of white matter hyperintensity (WMH) to cortical atrophy in healthy elderly subjects show gray matter reduction and ventricular expansion (37, 38) consistent with the WMB maps in Fig. S2 . DeCarli et al. also found that WMH volume was associated with increased ventricular volume, reduced brain volume, and reduced cognitive scores in healthy subjects (37) . Greater WMH volume was also associated with significantly lower frontal lobe metabolism, higher blood pressure, and lower scores on neuropsychological tests known to rely heavily on the frontal lobes. Although WMH The mean \u00b1 SD is shown for each measure; clinical measures are categorized by number of risk alleles at the obesity-associated tagging SNP and body mass index groups. ANOVAs, performed on each variable, show whether the mean clinical measure differed significantly across groups. \u03c7 2 tests were performed for categorical variables, where subscripts indicate the number of degrees of freedom. A nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA was used to assess measures that were not normally distributed [e.g., mini mental state examination (MMSE) scores]. White matter hyperintensity measures were log 10 transformed before statistical tests. F, females; M, males; NA, not analyzed.\nEmbargoed is known to be associated with a characteristic pattern of brain atrophy, this pattern is not consistent with that shown here to be associated with the presence of the FTO risk allele as determined through a conjunction analysis.\nThe mechanism behind this difference in brain structure from a single-base-pair change in the genome is not currently known, and it is not possible to say where the brain differences lie in the causal chain of factors that influence obesity. A strong hypothesis would be that BMI affects brain structure and that FTO exerts some additive detectable effect over and above whatever the BMI of the person happens to be. A weak hypothesis might be that BMI exerts an effect on brain structure and that FTO tracks this effect because is it associated with BMI. We made some efforts to see if we could detect any independent (additive) effect of FTO, above and beyond what is explainable by BMI, which FTO is known to affect. If FTO effects are not seen after adjustment for BMI ( Fig.  S4) , it is either because the effects are present but too small to be detected, given the high collinearity of BMI and FTO, or because FTO has a causal effect on BMI but no independent statistical effect on brain volume after adjusting for BMI.\nBMI had an independent effect on the brain, over and above what is explainable by FTO, because its effect was seen in separate groups of people with the same genotype ( Fig. S5 ; see Table S2 for subject demographics). Perhaps surprisingly, a strong effect of BMI was seen in carriers (with one or more FTO risk alleles), but it was not detected in noncarriers of the FTO allele ( Fig. S5 , unthresholded maps), even though the sample size for the noncarriers was larger (n = 78) than the homozygous at-risk group (n = 33) where BMI effects were still seen. Although the lack of a detectable effect of BMI in FTO noncarriers does not imply that it would not be present in a large sample, it cannot be ruled out that FTO status may influence the effect of BMI on the brain, which should be investigated when larger samples are available.\nHere we modeled the influence of previously identified risk alleles in the FTO gene on the brain, on the basis of a proxy, or tagging SNP, that is 98.8% accurate in predicting the verified risk alleles according to a similar population sample ( Fig. S1 ). Therefore, although we are not measuring the verified risk allele, we have an acceptable proxy to measure its effect on brain structure. The tagging SNP is very highly linked to the previously associated polymorphisms, so little would be gained by using imputation techniques to estimate the allele at the associated locus on the basis of the surrounding genotype data in this study.\nRecent studies have shown that physical activity and diet may provide promising outcomes for individuals who carry the obesityassociated risk allele (39) . A study of middle-aged individuals showed that a high-fat diet and low leisure-time physical activity might increase susceptibility for higher BMI in those carrying the FTO allele (39) . In another study of 704 healthy adults, weight increase attributable to the presence of the risk allele was numerically less, although not significantly less, in subjects who were physically active (40) . Another study showed that physical activity attenuated the genetic effect of carrying the obesity-associated risk allele on BMI and waist circumference (41) . Even in individuals who are genetically susceptible to obesity, physical activity can play a major role in controlling obesity and waist circumference.\nThe present finding has important implications for obesity research and for combating the progression of neurodegeneration.\nEmbargoed Conjunction Analysis. Conjunction analysis was conducted by creating a map composed of the maximum (least associated) P value at each voxel from both conditions of interest (29) . An FDR correction on the maximum P value (minimum statistic) map was used to correct for multiple comparisons (27) . Voxels surviving multiple comparisons are displayed in Fig. 3 .\nCDF Plots. CDF plots, based on the above correlation tests, were used to rank the proportion of significant voxels in association with SNP rs3751812, BMI, and WMB ( Fig. S3 ) (24, 25, 51 Please note that this is your opportunity to correct errors in your article prior to publication.

S1, except that the dependent variable y was a vector representing the determinant of the Jacobian matrix of deformation at a particular voxel (which measures the volume of that region relative to the mean template). The regression model was fitted at each voxel in the brain to determine the association of this risk allele to structure across the entire brain, after adjusting for any effects of age and sex. Fig. 1 (Upper) in the main text shows the P value of the \u03b2 1 parameter (expressing the FTO effect) in regions that survived the false discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons, and Fig. 1 (Lower) shows the value of \u03b2 1 in areas with a significant P value.\nBMI and Brain Structure. Associations between BMI and brain structure were again examined using a similar multiple regression model to Eq. S1, except that the dependent variable, y, was a vector representing the determinant of the Jacobian matrix of deformation at a particular voxel and the independent measure, x 1 , was a vector representing the BMI across subjects. The regression was conducted at each voxel in the brain to determine the association of BMI to structural differences, in the subject sample, across the entire brain. Fig. 2 (Upper) in the main text shows the P value of the \u03b2 1 parameter (expressing the BMI effect) in regions that survived the false discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons; Fig. 2 (Lower) shows the value of \u03b2 1 in areas with a significant P value.\nWhite Matter Burden and Brain Structure. Associations between white matter hyperintensity and brain structure were again evaluated with a similar statistical model to Eq. S1, except that the dependent variable, y, was a vector representing the determinant of the Jacobian matrix of deformation at a particular voxel and the independent measure, x 1 , was a vector representing the log 10 transform of the white matter hyperintensity Q:3 volume (in cubic centimeters) across subjects. The WMB measure is a single number for each subject, but its effect on brain volumes was assessed voxelwise. The regression was run at each voxel in the brain to determine the association of WMB to structure across the entire brain. Fig. S2 (Upper) shows the P value of the \u03b2 1 parameter (expressing the WMB effect) in regions that survived the false discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons; Fig. S2 (Lower) shows the value of \u03b2 1 in areas with a significant P value.\nGlucose by Risk Allele Interactions on Brain Structure. We also assessed whether there were any interactions between (i) glucose levels by (ii) the presence or absence of the FTO risk allele. The interactions assessed the effects of these two variables on brain structure, after controlling for age, sex, glucose levels, and risk allele effects according to the regression model\nwhere y is a vector representing the determinant of the Jacobian matrix of deformation at a particular voxel (a measure of regional brain volume), x 1 is a binary vector representing presence or absence of the risk allele of the FTO gene at the tagging SNP, x 2 is a vector representing the age of each subject, x 3 is a vector representing the sex of each subject, x 4 is a vector representing glucose levels across subjects, and x 1 x 4 represents a term that will fit if there is a significant interaction between glucose levels and risk allele status. This regression was conducted at each voxel across the brain, and it was found that the \u03b2 5 parameter (the interaction term) was not significantly different from zero in the brain when using an FDR correction for multiple comparisons.\nWMB by Risk Allele Interactions on Brain Structure. The statistical model used for this analysis was exactly the same as in Eq. S2 with the exception that x 4 represents a vector representing WMB levels across subjects, and x 1 x 4 represents the interaction between WMB levels and risk allele status. Similarly, this regression was conducted at each voxel across the brain, and it was found that the \u03b2 5 parameter was not significantly different from zero in the brain when using an FDR correction for multiple comparisons.\nInterpretation of Regression Coefficients and Volume Units. The regression coefficients reported in the main text show the size of the effect on brain structure (Figs. 1 and 2 and Figs. S2, S4, and S5). There are two equivalent representations of the regression coefficients. The percentages in the main text do represent the group differences in mean volume, but all of the group differences are denominated in units of volume relative to an unbiased standard brain template-a template specially constructed to be balanced, or unbiased, by including equal numbers of people from each genotype group ( Fig. 1 and Table S1 ). This\nvolume is not exactly the same as the percentage volume difference between carrier and noncarrier groups if one of those groups is used as a reference. For example, if the carriers were 10% smaller than the template and the noncarriers were 10% bigger, we report this as a 20% difference, although it could be considered a 22.2% difference (100 \u00d7 0.2/0.9), if the carriers were used as a reference, or an 18.2% difference (100 \u00d7 0.2/1.1) if the noncarriers were used as a reference. If one group were ill and the other healthy, we would tend to express deficits relative to the healthy group. But as all subjects here are healthy, we used the population mean as a reference to define the units of percentage for volume, so that would lead to the noncarriers being considered as having a volume excess. As such, the percentage units are quantified as a percentage of the size of structures in the mean template, rather than relative to the size of structures in the noncarrier group, but they do reflect differences between the two groups.\nTo avoid confusion, the color bar and figure legends in the main text specify units of \u0394Template Volume (mm 3 ). This Q:5 unit is convertible to a percentage difference if the population mean volume is considered as the reference. Each voxel has a volume of 1 mm 3 , and percentage volume reduction or excess relative to the template may be written in terms of the change in the template volume (i.e., a 5% reduction relative to the template would indicate a deficit of 0.05 mm 3 at that voxel). Similarly the regression coefficients for continuous variables such as BMI and WMB ( Fig. 2 and Figs. S2 and S5) represent the difference-as a proportion of the mean template volume-per unit of the continuous variable. The units of this regression slope are mm 3 per kg\u00b7m \u22122 , in the case of BMI, for example. However, neither representation is exactly the same as the percentage volume difference between the carrier and noncarrier groups, if one of those groups is chosen as a reference. If the volume differences are expressed relative to the noncarrier group (who have larger volumes), the percentage differences would be marginally smaller (as the reference value is higher). We used the unbiased template as a reference, rather than the noncarriers, as arguably all subjects are normal, so the noncarriers might be considered as having a higher volume than the healthy population mean and the carriers a lower volume.\nImage Correction Across Sites. Rigorous guidelines for standardizing MRI scans across study site and across time are detailed in ref. 8 . Briefly, images were calibrated with phantom-based geometric corrections to ensure consistency across scanners. Additional image corrections included (i) correction of geometric distortions due to gradient nonlinearity, (ii) adjustment for image intensity inhomogeneity due to B1 field nonuniformity using calibration scans, (iii) reducing residual intensity homogeneity, and (iv) geometric scaling according to a phantom scan acquired for each subject to adjust for scanner-and session-specific calibration errors. Each incoming image file was quality checked for\nEmbargoed medical abnormalities and image quality. Because of the extent of these corrections and that a large number of sites (58) acquired data, study center was not included as a covariate in these analyses. The scans used in this study were collected from 53 of the 58 sites.\nIn addition, the ADNI scanning protocol was developed after a rigorous preparatory phase in which we and others made sure that the scan volumes were reproducible and stable across repeated scanning, using the same volume quantification method as in this paper (9) . Even so, we did check if any one scanner vendor was overrepresented in the FTO allelic groups. The table below represents the breakdown of subjects by scanner vendor: As this was a multisite study, rigorous calibration and cross-site standardizations were performed to ensure the comparability and stability of the imaging measures; we checked if any one scanner vendor was overrepresented in the FTO allelic groups, and no differences were found in the scanner vendor used (\u03c7 2 2 = 1.42; P = 0.4916). \nEmbargoed Fig. S2 . (Upper) 3D maps show areas where regional brain volumes were significantly associated with log-transformed whole brain white matter hyperintensity Q:6 (WMH) volume (cubic centimeters) in healthy elderly subjects (n = 169). The log 10 of whole brain WMH volume is referred to as white matter burden (WMB). (Lower) In the significant areas, the regression coefficients (unstandardized beta values) are shown at each voxel. These represent the estimated degree of tissue excess or deficit at each voxel, for each log cubic centimeter increase in whole brain WMH volume, after statistically controlling for effects of age and sex on brain structure. Areas that are positively associated with WMB are shown in blue (tissue expansion mainly represented as CSF expansion found at the ventricle boundaries) and areas that are negatively associated with WMB are shown in red (volume deficits) (Lower). The majority of areas that are statistically significant are associated with a deficit in brain volume in those with greater WMB, which is as expected. All maps were significant after standard correction for multiple comparisons using FDR (q = 0.05; critical uncorrected P = 0.0016). Images are displayed in radiological convention (left side of the brain shown on the right) and are displayed over a study-specific brain image template (MDT). Fig. S3 . The cumulative distribution of P values observed for the maps of association created above. Brain structure is more strongly associated with BMI (green line; critical uncorrected P = 0.0202) than with the FTO tagging SNP, WMB (red line; critical uncorrected P = 0.0016), or rs3751812 (blue line; critical uncorrected P = 0.0013). Even so, both associations are significant, according to the FDR criterion. The black line represents a reference: The point where it intersects the green or blue lines, other than at the origin, represents a statistical threshold that can be applied to the map to control the false discovery rate at q = 0.05 (i.e., 5% of the suprathreshold voxels are expected to be false positives). Fig. S4 . Regression coefficient (unstandardized beta) maps for regional brain volume correlating with FTO, after adjusting for age and sex (Upper; same as Fig. 1 Upper) compared to unthresholded regression coefficient maps for regional brain volume correlating with FTO, after adjusting for age, sex, and BMI (Lower). Unthresholded maps are shown (Lower) as there were no significant regions after correcting at 5% FDR in the whole brain analysis after adjusting for age, sex, and BMI. This is perhaps to be expected as FTO influences BMI. Images are displayed in radiological convention (left side of the brain shown on the right) and are displayed over a study-specific brain image template (MDT). Fig. S5 . 3D maps show areas where regional brain volumes were significantly associated with BMI in subjects carrying two copies of the risk allele (n = 33; critical uncorrected P = 0.0022) (first row), subjects carrying a single copy of the risk allele (n = 95; critical uncorrected P = 0.0113) (second row), and subjects carrying at least one copy of the risk allele (n = 128, critical uncorrected P = 0.016) (third row). Intriguingly, volumes were not statistically associated with BMI, after FDR correction, in FTO noncarriers (fourth row, unthresholded maps). The regression coefficients (unstandardized beta values) are shown at each voxel. These coefficients Q:7 represent the estimated degree of tissue excess or deficit at each voxel, as a percentage, for each unit gain in body mass index, after statistically controlling for effects of age and sex, on brain structure. Images are displayed in radiological convention (left side of the brain shown on the right) and are displayed over a study-specific brain image template (MDT). Fig. S6 . 3D maps show areas where regional brain volumes were significantly associated with having one or more risk alleles of the FTO gene (n = 206; critical uncorrected P = 0.0015) (Upper) and BMI (n = 206; critical uncorrected P = 0.021) (Lower) based on a log 10 transformation of the Jacobian determinants. These maps are consistent with the significance maps based on the Jacobian determinants ( Figs. 1 and 2) . Fig. S7 . Effects of varying the sample size. Plots of the cumulative proportion of P values are shown for correlations between volume differences at each voxel in the whole brain and carrying the risk allele of the FTO gene as sample size (n) is reduced. In general, smaller sizes show lower critical P values than those computed from large sample sizes. The approximate minimal sample size needed to repeat the finding by randomly removing subjects from our sample was calculated to be 96. The mean \u00b1 SD is shown for each measure; clinical measures are categorized by number of risk alleles at the obesity-associated tagging SNP and body mass index groups. ANOVAs, performed on each variable, show whether the mean clinical measure differed significantly across groups. \u03c7 2 tests were performed for categorical variables, where subscripts indicate degrees of freedom. A nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA was used to assess measures that were not normally distributed (e.g., MMSE scores). White matter hyperintensity values were log 10 transformed before statistical tests. F, females; M, males; NA, not analyzed. The MDT was designed to be an unbiased representation of the sample. Equal numbers of subjects with risk and nonrisk genotypes were included, and equal numbers of men and women were included in the MDT group. There was no statistical difference in the age of the subjects used in the MDT relative to the other subjects in the sample (76.95 \u00b1 4.56 years vs. 75.95 \u00b1 5.08 years; t 204 = 1.143; P = 0.2542). Additionally, there was no statistical difference between the BMI of the subjects in the MDT and the BMI of the other subjects in the sample (26.21 \u00b1 3.90 kg/m 2 vs. 26.60 \u00b1 4.52 kg/m 2 ; t 204 = \u22120.503; P = 0.616)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Identification of the Risk Allele. Two SNPs, rs1421085 and rs17817449, have been previously identified as significantly and reliably associated with obesity (6) . The risk alleles for obesity are the C allele for rs1421085 and the G allele for rs17817449. Neither of these SNPs was directly genotyped in our sample; however, we were able to exploit the linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs to find a proxy, or tagging SNP, for these risk alleles. For more details and the LD plot, please see . Association Between BMI and FTO Genotype. After controlling for age and sex, we found an association between BMI and carrying at least one copy of the risk allele at the FTO tagging SNP (n = 206; \u03b2 = 1.480; P = 0.0185) in our population of cognitively healthy elderly subjects. This finding was in the direction expected from prior studies (risk allele genotype giving higher BMI). This result gives yet another replication, in an independent sample of subjects, that the FTO gene variants are indeed associated with BMI. Additionally, we found that education was not correlated with either BMI or the FTO genotype (see SI Text for more details).\nObesity-Associated Risk Alleles and Brain Structure. Structural brain differences in gray and white matter were statistically related to carrying at least one risk allele of the FTO gene ( Fig. 1 ; critical uncorrected P = 1.31 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ). We used a standard false discovery rate (FDR) correction (27) for multiple statistical comparisons across voxels of the brain, at the conventionally accepted level of q = 0.05. Significance Q:11 maps are shown ( Fig. 1 Upper) and the corresponding regression coefficient (unstandardized beta) maps are shown below them, representing the average volume difference of brain tissue deficit or excess relative to the template for those subjects carrying at least one copy of the obesity-associated risk allele, versus noncarriers. The regression coefficients can equivalently be interpreted as the average percentage of volume difference relative to the template between carriers and noncarriers upon a simple conversion (SI Text), and both representations are discussed. BMI and Brain Structure. As found in previous studies (19) , subjects with higher BMI had significantly lower regional brain volumes (FDR q = 0.05, critical uncorrected P = 0.0202) in many areas (Fig. 2 ). With every 1-unit increase in BMI, there was an associated 1-1.5% average brain tissue reduction (after statistically controlling for age and sex) in several broadly distributed frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobe regions. Atrophy was also detected in the brainstem and cerebellar regions.\nWhite Matter Burden and Brain Structure. To understand whether the FTO effect on brain structure was attributable to microvascular damage in the white matter, a measure of whole brain (Upper) 3D maps show areas where regional brain tissue volumes were significantly associated with carrying the risk allele at the obesity-associated tagging SNP, rs3751812, in healthy elderly subjects (n = 206). (Lower) In the significant areas, the regression coefficients (unstandardized beta values) are shown at each voxel. These values represent the estimated degree of tissue excess or deficit at each voxel (in cubic millimeters relative to the template) that is associated with the presence of the risk allele, after statistically controlling for effects of age and sex on brain structure. Images are in radiological convention (left side of the brain shown on the right) and are displayed over the MDT.

In a large sample of healthy elderly subjects scanned with brain MRI, we identified structural brain atrophy in carriers of the FTO risk allele. Those carrying at least one copy of the risk allele showed brain tissue deficits in the frontal and the occipital lobes, areas that are also associated with volume reductions in subjects with higher BMI.

Neuroimaging and genetic data were acquired from 818 subjects as part of the ADNI, a large 5-year study launched in 2004 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), private pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations (42, 43) . The goal of the ADNI study is to determine biological markers of Alzheimer's disease through neuroimaging, genetics, neuropsychological tests, and other measures to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness and lessen the time of clinical trials. Subjects were recruited from 58 sites in the United States. The study was conducted according to the Good Clinical Practice guidelines, the Declaration of Helsinki, and U.S. 21 Code of Federal Regulations Part 50, Protection of Human Subjects, and Part 56, Institutional Review Boards. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before protocol-specific procedures were performed. All data acquired as part of this study are publicly available (http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/).\nThe sample examined in this study consisted of a subsample of the entire ADNI cohort. Only Caucasian (non-Hispanic) cognitively healthy elderly subjects were included (n = 207). Caucasian subjects were selected to reduce population stratification effects (44) . One subject whose height was not recorded was excluded, as BMI could not be calculated. The sample analyzed in this study involved 206 subjects (Table 1) .\nDNA Isolation, SNP Genotyping Methods, and Genetic Analysis. For details about DNA isolation and SNP genotyping methods, please refer to SI Text. Genomewide genotype information was collected at 620,901 markers; however, this study deals only with one SNP, rs3751812. The allele on the forward strand is reported. This marker met quality criteria based on previous genomewide association studies (45) : genotype call rate >95%, nonsignificant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium P > 5.7 \u00d7 10 \u22127 , minor allele frequency >0.01, and a platform-specific recommended quality control score of >0.15. LD patterns with previously identified mutations in the general population were explored in the HapMap sample (9), using allele frequency information from a European population (CEU; http://www. hapmap.org/; Phase III/Release #2, Feb 09, NCBI b36 assembly).\nMRI Acquisition, Image Calibration, and Correction. All subjects were scanned at multiple ADNI sites according to a standardized protocol developed after a major effort to evaluate 3D T 1 -weighted sequences for morphometric analyses (46, 47) . High-resolution structural brain MRI scans were acquired using Q:15 1.5-and 3-Tesla (T) MRI scanners; however, because the majority of subjects were scanned at 1.5 T, and to avoid any potentially confounding effect of scanner field strength on tissue volume quantification (48), we restricted our analysis to 1.5-T MRI scans. See SI Text for scanner vendor information and image correction across sites.\nTensor-Based Morphometry (TBM) and 3D Jacobian Maps. Images were preprocessed according to standard protocol discussed previously (25) . A minimal deformation template (MDT) was created from the MRI scans of 40 cognitively healthy ADNI subjects (See Table S1 for subject demographics) to enable automated image registration and reduce statistical bias (24, 25) . All scans were nonlinearly aligned to the study-specific template so that they would all share a common coordinate system. The local expansion factor of the 3D elastic warping transform (26) , calculated as the determinant of the Jacobian matrix of the deformation, was plotted for each subject. These 3D expansion factor maps show relative volume differences between each individual and the common template, and reveal areas of structural volume deficits or expansions, relative to the population average. Additionally, log 10 transformations of the Jacobian determinant were computed and all regression analyses were run using the transformed data ( Fig. S6 ). Such a transformation can remove skewness in the Jacobian distribution, although the dependent variable is a logged volume rather than a true volume (49) .\nRegression of Structural Brain Differences with the Obesity-Associated Tagging SNP and with BMI. At each voxel, the relation of the Jacobian values (which represent brain tissue deficit or excess relative to the standard template) to the presence or absence of the risk allele of the SNP rs3751812 ( Fig. 1) , BMI (Fig. 2) , and WMB (Fig. S2) controlling for age and sex was tested using the general linear model. The significance maps were corrected for multiple comparisons using the FDR method (27) . The critical uncorrected P value is reported, which represents the highest P-value threshold for which the surviving voxels are expected to have no more than 5% false positives. The critical P-value threshold is generally larger for greater effect sizes in the map. Further details of the statistical models are found in SI Text. We estimated the minimal number of subjects (n = 96) needed to repeat the finding by successively removing subjects, at random but without bias, from our sample and calculating the critical P value for FDR threshold, until the results were no longer significant. This gives a rough estimate of how many subjects are needed to find the effect in an independent sample (on the premise that in very small samples, the FTO effect would not explain enough of the variance) as in prior studies (50) . A cumulative distribution function (CDF) plot displays the results from smaller sample sizes having lower critical P values than those computed from larger sample sizes (Fig. S7 )."}, {"section_title": "Ho et al.", "text": "PNAS Early Edition | 5 of 6"}, {"section_title": "NEUROSCIENCE", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "AUTHOR QUERIES", "text": "AUTHOR PLEASE ANSWER ALL QUERIES 1 Q: 10_Please verify that all supporting information (SI) citations are correct.

Using the HapMap as a template, we found a proxy in our sample for these SNPs of interest. Fig. S1 shows the LD (quantified using the r 2 statistic) using the Hap-Map data from a European sample (CEU) from HapMap data Phase III/Release 2, Feb 2009, NCBI b36 assembly. There are two SNPs in high LD with the associated risk marker, rs8050136 (r 2 = 0.936 to rs1421085; r 2 = 1 to rs17817449) and rs3751812 (r 2 = 0.958 to rs1421085; r 2 = 0.979 to rs17817449). Both of these tagging SNPs were linked to both verified risk SNPs and to each other, so we chose to use only one SNP, rs3751812, with the highest mean correlation (mean r 2 = 0.9875) to both verified risk SNPs. The initially identified FTO variant (rs9939609) (2) is also in high LD with the chosen tagging SNP (r 2 = 0.979; Fig. S1 ). At the tagging SNP, rs3751812, the risk allele is the T allele and the frequency in the population of those sampled was 16.02% (T/T), 46 .12% (T/G), and 37.86% (G/G). Subjects with one or two risk alleles were pooled into a single \"carriers\" group due to small sample size of subjects carrying two risk alleles (n = 33).\nDNA Isolation and SNP Genotyping Methods. DNA was isolated from B lymphocyte cells taken from blood (3) Correlation Between BMI and Years of Education. We wanted to investigate whether any association between BMI, the FTO risk allele, and brain structure was mediated by some other directly measurable variable, such as educational level. In a separate analysis of healthy elderly individuals from the Cardiovascular Health Study (5) , BMI was found to be weakly, but significantly correlated to the number of years of education completed (n = 256; r 2 = 0.024; P = 0.012). In the sample of 206 healthy subjects in ADNI, there was no relation between BMI and educational level, measured in years (n = 206; r 2 = 4.8 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ; P = 0.76). This Q:1 result may be because there is more variation in the educational level for the CHS Q:2 sample (\u03c3 2 = 17.91) than the ADNI sample (\u03c3 2 = 8.70); even so, educational level did not explain the effects of genotype detected here, nor was it associated with FTO genotype.\nWhite Matter Burden and Brain Structure. White matter hyperintensity (WMH) was assessed in the space of the MDT on the basis of the signal intensities of coregistered T 1 -, T 2 -, and PDweighted scans and on the basis of population statistics regarding the spatial distribution and neighborhood structure of white matter lesions throughout the brain (6) . The method provides white matter hyperintensity measures that agree strongly with FLAIR-based gold-standard measures. White matter burden (WMB) was defined as log 10 of the WMH volume in cubic centimeters. The log transform was used so the values fit better a normal distribution (Jarque-Bera test; P = 0.3294).\nCumulative Distribution Function (CDF) Plots. CDF plots, based on the above correlations, are shown in Fig. S3 . These plots can be used to visually rank the degree of statistical association between brain structure and any external parameter, such as genetic variation, BMI, or WMB. CDF plots that rise more sharply at the origin indicate variables that correlate more strongly with brain structure. Structural brain deficits were more strongly correlated with BMI (green curve) than with WMB (red curve) or the FTO tagging SNP, rs3751812 (blue curve). The black line represents a reference; the point where the black line intersects the other curves represents the statistical threshold that can be applied to the map to control the false discovery rate at 5%; in other words, when thresholded in this way, the statistical map is expected to contain only 5% false positive suprathreshold voxels. CDFs can be used in this way to rank the effects of covariates (7) where higher CDFs tend to indicate stronger effect sizes, on the basis of the definition that a more lenient FDR q-controlling critical P value reflects an improvement in the overall fit of the covariate in the map. Even so, this must be qualified because the maps from which the CDFs were created relate to entirely different brain regions and networks, as well as having stronger or weaker associations within those regions, so the highest CDF plot cannot be interpreted as finding the most powerful associations. Rather, it shows the proportion of P values at multiple statistical thresholds and presents a convenient way to compare the total extents of maps at multiple statistical thresholds (albeit conflating different regions).\nDescription of Statistical Models. Several different statistical models were used throughout the manuscript; these are explained in the next section.\nAssociation Between BMI and FTO Genotype. The association between BMI and FTO genotype was conducted using a standard multiple regression model, of the form\nwhere y is a vector whose components represent BMI for each subject, x 1 is a binary vector representing presence or absence of the risk allele of the FTO gene at the tagging SNP, x 2 is a vector representing the age of each subject, x 3 is a vector representing the sex of each subject, and \u03b5 is an error term. An ordinary leastsquares cost function was used to estimate each \u03b2 i parameter, and the significance and value of the relevant \u03b2 i parameter are reported in the main text.\nObesity-Associated Risk Alleles and Brain Structure.
