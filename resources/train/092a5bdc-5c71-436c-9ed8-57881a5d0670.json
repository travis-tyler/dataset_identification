Weiner, MD. It is an ongoing study with a public-private partnership in the United States and Canada that gathers and analyzes thousands of subjects' brain scans, genetic profiles, and biomarkers in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. The main goal of ADNI is to understand relationships among the clinical, cognitive, imaging, genetic and biochemical biomarker characteristics of the entire spectrum of Alzheimer's diseases (AD).\nUltimately, the hope is to achieve early detection of AD in preparation for early intervention of the disease progression, and also to help recruiting appropriate individuals in clinical trials.\nClinical outcomes for assessing one's cognitive function in ADNI are bounded scores from well-established neuropsychological tests, such as the Alzheimer's disease assessment scale (ADAS, Rosen et al., 1984; Kueper et al., 2018) , mini-mental state examination (Tombaugh and McIntyre, 1992) , and Rey auditory verbal learning test (Schmidt, 1996) . Distributions of these test scores from the ADNI cohort are typically heavy-tailed and skewed. As an example, Figure 1 presents histogram of the ADAS-cognition sub-scale scores, also referred to as ADAS-11, of subjects at month 12 who were diagnosed with late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) when they entered the ADNI Phase 1 study.\nIn order to effectively reveal the association between one's cognitive skill and potential influential biomarkers, we formulate parametric mode regression models tailored for heavytailed, skewed, and bounded response data, with efficient prediction as our goal of statistical inference besides identifying influential biomarkers for AD. Under the nonparametric framework, Wang et al. (2017) carried out mode regression analysis of ADNI data to predict cognitive impairment using neuroimaging data. They noted that mean regression analysis for studying the association between the cognitive assessment of an individual and the individual's neuroimaging features failed to yield scientifically meaningful results due to the heavy-tailed and skewed noise presented in data typically arising in this application. In ad- dition to biomedical applications, mode regression for association study has been routinely used in econometrics (Lee, 1989 (Lee, , 1993 Kemp and Silva, 2012; Damien et al., 2017) , astronomy (Bamford et al., 2008) , traffic engineering (Einbeck and Tutz, 2006) . Kemp and Silva (2012) argued that the mode is the most intuitive measure of central tendency for positively skewed data found in many econometric applications such as wages, prices, and expenditures.\nMore generally, the conditional mode serves as a more informative summary for associations between a response Y and covariates X than the conditional mean or median when the distribution of Y given X is heavy-tailed or skewed. When comparing with predictions based on conditional means or medians, predictions based on conditional modes can provide more meaningful estimated outcomes. Yao and Li (2014) showed that, when the interval width is fixed, a mode-based prediction interval tends to have a higher coverage probability than a mean-based prediction interval.\nMost existing works on mode regression involve nonparametric components (Yao and Li, 2014; Chen et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2013; Yang and Yang, 2014) . These nonparametric and semiparametric approaches are developed under the frequentist framework. A few developments under the Bayesian framework include Yu and Aristodemou (2012) and Damien et al. (2017) . Even though nonparametric methods and semiparametric methods can protect against misleading inference caused by inadequate parametric assumptions, often at the price of low statistical efficiency, it is not unreasonable to believe that an inference procedure may still provide reliable inference for the mode of a distribution even when certain aspects, such as tails, of the distribution are not well estimated by this procedure (Hall, 1992; Zhou and Huang, 2019) . Hence, with the potential gain in efficiency, parametric regression models can be useful in studying the association between a response and covariates via inferring the conditional mode.\nAssuming a unimodal conditional distribution for the response, we formulate in Section 2 two new classes of mode regression models for a bounded response. Bounded response data are ubiquitous in practice, with the ADAS-11 score as one example. Other examples include rates or proportions, such as a disease prevalence, the fraction of household income spent on food, and the proportion of food and hygienic waste in residential solid waste. Although, technically, one can often map a bounded response to a new response whose support is the entire real line, say, via a logit transformation for a rate response, and then carry out regression analysis on the new response, it is practically more appealing to directly study the association between the original response and covariates.\nFollowing the model formulation, we outline maximum likelihood estimation of parameters in these models in Section 2. In Section 3 we propose graphical and numerical diagnostics methods for detecting various sources of model misspecification when one draws inference based on an assumed model in the two proposed families. Section 4 presents simulation studies where we carry out mode regression analysis using these assumed models based on data generated from models that may or may not belong to the two families. In these simulation experiments, we report maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) for covariate effects, operating characteristics of the proposed diagnostics methods, and prediction intervals constructed based on the proposed mode regression models. In Section 5 we carry out mean and mode regression analysis for a data set from ADNI, and also for another data set from a geological study. Finally, we summarize contributions of this work and discuss follow-up research in Section 6.\n2 Two families of regression models and maximum likelihood estimation"}, {"section_title": "Regression models", "text": "Without loss of generality, we assume from now on that the response variable has support on [0, 1], since any other bounded support can be rescaled to the unit interval.

A larger m leads to a GBP distribution more concentrated around the mode with a smaller variance. Figure 2 depicts three GBP density functions, in comparison with three beta density functions that share the same mode and variance as the corresponding depicted GBP distributions. This figure shows the general pattern that, with the mode and variance fixed, a GBP density displays a sharper drop toward zero on both sides of the mode than that for a beta density.\nDirectly including the mode in the parameterization, as seen in the GBP family, makes it more convenient to draw inference for the mode. For this reason, we reparameterize the two shape parameters in the beta density function in (2.1) by setting \u03b1 1 = 1 + m\u03b8 and\nThis parameterization not only signifies the parameter of central interest, \u03b8, but also makes \u03b1 1 and \u03b1 2 larger than one, ensuring the existence of a unique mode.

Because the beta family is an exponential family, the corresponding likelihood function is concave, suggesting the existence of a unique MLE for \u2126. Furthermore, regularity conditions required for the MLE to be consistent and asymptotically normal can also be easily verified for this regression model.\nWhen a GBP mode model is assumed, by (2.2), the log-likelihood function is given by\nMaximizing GBP (\u2126; D) with respect to \u2126 yields the MLE for \u2126 under the GBP mode regression model.

The algorithm in supplementary Section S1 outlines the bootstrap procedure under the null stating that the true model is a GBP mode model. A similar bootstrap procedure is used to estimate the p-value of the test statistic when one assumes a beta mode model.\nEmpirical evidence from simulation studies suggest that this bootstrap procedure can estimate the tail of the null distribution of Q(\u03a9; D) well enough to preserve the right size of the proposed score tests. Besides how well one can estimate certain percentiles of a null distribution, operating characteristics of the score tests also depend on the extent of distortion on moment estimation when an inadequate model is assumed.

Denote these MLEs by\u03b8(x) and\u03bc(x), respectively, and denote byf e (e|x) the estimated pdf.

In particular, the dataset we consider consists of a cohort of 245 subjects who was diagnosed with LMCI when they entered the ADNI Phase 1 study and were followed up at least at both months 6 and 12.

Under each proposed mode regression model, we have developed model diagnostic tools to detect various forms of inadequate parametric assumptions.\nBesides allowing the mode to depend on covariates, one may consider covariate-dependent shape parameter m(X) to expand the class of mode regression models. A more flexible family of mode regression models can be formulated as mixtures of beta or GBP distributions, which will allow inclusion of multimodal distributions. When an assumed mode regression model approximates the underlying truth reasonably well, we expect more effective variable selection procedures based on these mode regression models when comparing with exist-ing non-/semi-parametric mean-/mode-based variable selection procedures. Hence, variable selection based on parametric mode regression models is an exciting direction of further exploration.\nThe family of GBP distributions is a rare distribution family that directly includes the mode in the parameterization, which makes it especially suitable for mode regression. If, unlike responses in our current study, the support of the response is unknown, then we have additional parameter(s) in the GBP density relating to the support, resulting in a nonregular model.
