TCs are the costliest natural disasters for the United States, historically causing both significant fatalities and economic damage (Pielke, 2007;Rappaport, 2014). While it is problematic to attribute any particular severe weather event to climate change, it can be productive to investigate the impact of climate change on the frequency and intensity of especially extreme weather events (Lackmann, 2014). A number of studies have been completed with the intention of investigating connections between climate and TCs (Gray, 1968;Gray, 1984;Emanuel, 1995a;Bove et al., 1998;Emanuel, 2005IPCC 2012IPCC , 2013Kozar et al., 2013;Lackmann, 2014, Melillo et al., 2014."}, {"section_title": "1.1: Downscaling to create long-term synthetic tropical cyclone data sets", "text": "Although the investigations above, as well as others, have made great strides towards identifying connections between climate patterns and TC activity in the Atlantic basin, such studies are rather limited in scope due to the brevity of the observational record, which spans only from approximately AD 1851 to the present (Kozar et al., 2013). In addition, Kozar et al. (2013) points out that there is some disagreement among scholars as to the reliability of the observational record. Because the observational record of TC activity in the Atlantic is short and potentially biased, it is difficult to accurately assess long-term trends in storm activity; thus, it is desirable to use an alternative approach in order to overcome these issues. Kozar et al. (2013) develops such an alternative approach, using a National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Climate System Model, version 1.4 (CSM 1.4) simulation, forced by natural and anthropogenic forcings, that spans the past millennium (AD 850-1999). Using monthly mean thermodynamic state variables from the simulation, including SST and vertical profiles of temperature and humidity, as well as daily mean values of interpolated 250 hPa and 850 hPa winds, a downscaling method is employed to generate a long-term TC data set within the context of the model simulation. Caveats related to the use of the NCAR CSM 1.4 in the Kozar et al. (2013) study include too much vertical wind shear in the Atlantic basin, cooler than expected North Atlantic SSTs, and a lack lower stratospheric cooling, as seen recently in the observational record. In spite of these issues with the model, the results of this study provide support for the use of paleohurricane records in analyzing longterm changes in TC activity, since synthetic TC landfalls align well with basin-wide TC counts on multidecadal timescales. In particular, Kozar et al. (2013) finds that correlations between counts of storms making landfall in the United States and basin-wide TC activity are significant at the p = 0.05 significance level or greater. The downscaling method used by Kozar et al. (2013), developed in Emanuel et al. (2006) and Emanuel et al. (2008), can be applied to other more recent state-of-the-art climate models to perform further analysis of TC activity in the Atlantic basin. In general, the downscaling method can use thermodynamic and kinematic statistics from any globally gridded data to produce large sets of synthetic TCs. Downscaling to create TC data sets involves three main steps: genesis of storms, generating tracks for storms, and intensification of storms."}, {"section_title": "1.1.1: Synthetic tropical cyclone genesis", "text": "In the downscaling method employed by Kozar et al. (2013), and to be used in my own work, TC genesis is accomplished by random seeding. That is seeds, or warm-core vortices with peak winds of 12 m/s and almost no mid-level humidity anomalies, are planted at all times and places throughout the Atlantic basin, without regard to SST, season, or other factors, such as latitude, with the exception that storms are not permitted to form equatorward of 2 degrees N (Emanuel et al., 2008). Thus, this downscaling method assumes that the probability of a suitable initiating disturbance is uniform in space and time. However, because of the low peak winds and humidity levels that characterize the seeds, seeds initially decay; they are only considered to have formed a TC if they develop winds of at least 21 m/s, or 40 kts. According to Emanuel et al.

Tracks are terminated in this downscaling method when any of the following occurs: (1) The maximum winds of the storm fall below 13 m/s, (2) the storm's track takes it outside of the latitude/longitude box defined by 4 and 50 degrees North, and 5 and 11 degrees West, or (3) After 30 days have passed.

The CHIPS model is a deterministic, coupled air-sea model that is phrased in angular momentum coordinates, and thus allows for high resolution of the inner-core region of each storm. Inputs for the CHIPS model include variables describing the global model's thermodynamic state-SST, atmospheric temperature profiles, and relative humidity profiles-wind shear, derived from the wind fields used as input for the \"beta and advection model\", and the global model's monthly mean entropy at the 600 hPa level. Using these inputs, the model produces a maximum wind speed and radius of maximum wind for every synthetic TC at each point along its given path (Emanuel et al., 2008)."}, {"section_title": "1.2: The use of downscaled synthetic tropical cyclone data sets in surge analysis", "text": "Large data sets of synthetic TCs generated by downscaling may be used not only to investigate the relationships between landfalling hurricanes and basin-wide TC activity, as in Kozar et al. (2013), but also to evaluate long-term variations and trends in coastal inundation caused by storm surges associated with TCs (Lin et al., 2010b;Kozar et al., 2013). Lin et al. (2010b) looks into the distributions of storm surge in the New York City (NYC) region, for 7555 synthetic storms based on post-1970 best track Atlantic hurricane data. Surge heights for the 7555 storms, which pass within 200 km of the Battery in NYC, are modeled using the Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model (Jelesnianski et al., 1992). For comparison, surge heights for the storms producing the 9 largest surge heights in the SLOSH model are also modeled using the advanced circulation, or ADCIRC, model (Luettich et al., 1992). The SLOSH and ADCIRC modelled surge heights compare well with one another. Lin et al. (2010b) finds that the distribution of surge heights for the NYC region exhibits a large, riskdetermining tail. This tail is modelled using a generalized Pareto distribution, and return periods of surge heights produced using the 7555 synthetic storms are consistent with previous studies. Using a similar technique,  takes this surge risk analysis for NYC a step farther.  uses the downscaling method described in Emanuel et al. (2006) and Emanuel et al. (2008)  show that changes in TC characteristics led to increases in the extremes of the types of storms that create the largest storm surge events for the NYC region. These results indicate that storm surge risk for NYC increased considerably over the past millennium, showing the impacts of climate change on coastal inundation, and emphasizing the need for risk management strategies in this region. Finally, we evaluate future projections of storm surge and flood heights in NYC through the year 2100 (MPI, CCSM4, and IPSL models), and through the year 2300 (IPSL model), in the context of our long-term historical analysis for the same region. Using an interdisciplinary approach that combines downscaled TC simulations, storm surge models, proxy SLR records, and various SLR projections, we find that mean flood heights are projected to increase by ~0.24 to ~0.97 meters across all three of our models through the year 2100; by 2300, mean flood heights could increase by as much as ~2.85-~4.99 meters, results that are significant at the 99% confidence level. We find that, although the overall flood heights at The Battery in NYC are likely to increase through 2100 due to rising relative sea levels, individual storm surge heights may actually decrease in at least some cases. Although any decreased flood risk resulting from potential decreases in storm surge heights would likely be over-shadowed by increases in flood heights due to rising relative sea levels, any such potential increases in storm surge heights would compound increased risk of coastal flooding in the region due to rising relative sea levels. Our results show that flood heights in NYC have already significantly increased during the past millennium, and are likely to continue increasing in coming centuries. The precise amount of increased flood risk will depend upon the rate and amount of relative sea level rise realized, as well as changes to TC characteristics and their resulting storm surge heights. These findings indicate the extreme need for adaptation strategies and risk management plans in the NYC region. "}, {"section_title": "2.1: Introduction", "text": "In a changing climate, the impact of tropical cyclones (TCs) on the United States Atlantic and Gulf Coasts will be affected both by how often these storms occur and how powerful these storms become. TCs are extremely costly natural disasters for the United States, historically causing both significant fatalities and economic damage (Pielke, Jr., 2007;Rappaport, 2014  , Emanuel, (2005), Mann et al. (2007), Knutson et al., (2010), Kozar et al., (2013), and Lackmann, A considerable amount of research has been conducted investigating connections between TC behavior and sea surface temperature (SST), or potential intensity (PI). Gray (1968) discusses the important influence of SST on the buoyancy of cumulus clouds, particularly in the main development region (MDR) of the North Atlantic and other basins. Further, Emanuel (1995a) indicates that SST may be related to a number of TC traits, including the timescale over which TCs develop, the ratio of a mature storm's outer scale to the radius of maximum winds, the maximum azimuthal wind speed of mature TCs, and the central pressure of mature storms. Emanuel (2005) discusses the idea that it is not only SST, but also air temperature that influences the strength and intensity of TCs. In particular, Emanuel states that PI, which depends on both SST and the entire temperature profile of the troposphere, is the most appropriate measure of the thermodynamic environment for a TC. It should be noted that the relationship between PI and SST is mostly indirect, and Emanuel and Sobel (2013) showed that the change in PI per unit change in SST depends strongly on the nature of the climate forcing. Additionally, Emanuel (2005) investigates the potential destructiveness of TCs and the possible losses such storms could inflict upon coastal regions of the United States. Emanuel (2005) defines the power dissipation index (PDI) as an index of the potential destruction that a TC or hurricane may cause: (1) In this equation, Vmax is the maximum sustained wind speed at 10m, and \u03c4 is the lifetime of the storm.  (Emanuel, 2005).  acknowledges the existence of a strong correlation between Atlantic TC PDI and MDR SST from 1946-2007 as well. However, their work points out that a similarly strong relationship exists between PDI and relative SST-that is, the Atlantic tropical SST relative to the global mean tropical SST, which bears a more direct relationship to PI than does absolute SST. Swanson (2008) also notes that variations in Atlantic TC activity depend strongly on relative SST. Variable warming in the Atlantic MDR relative to the global tropics is likely to result from natural multidecadal variability or anthropogenic aerosol forcing, but is less likely to be the result of greenhouse gas forcing Knutson et al., 2010) (though the latter rests on the models correctly reproducing forced changes in tropical Pacific ocean-atmosphere dynamics, something that has been questioned in the literature, e.g. most recently Steinman et al. (2015)). Thus, the correlation between the relative SST and PDI for the Atlantic basin may indicate that the recent increase in intensity of Atlantic TCs is the result of factors other than increases in concentrations of greenhouse gases Swanson, 2008;Knutson et al., 2010). In our work, we aim to further investigate the relationship between PDI as a measure of TC activity in the Atlantic basin and PDI and various ocean surface temperature metrics. It is also instructive to investigate how a changing climate could affect TC numbers. Using a data set of TCs downscaled from a National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Climate System Model, version 1.4 (CSM 1.4) simulation, which is forced by both natural and anthropogenic forcings and spans the past millennium (AD 850-1999), Kozar et al. (2013) find that the alignment of TC landfalls with basinwide TC activity on multidecadal time scales lends support for the use of paleohurricane records in analyzing long-term changes in TC activity. Here, we revisit that analysis using synthetic TC datasets downscaled from an assortment of simulations using state-of-the-art Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate models."}, {"section_title": "2.2: Methods", "text": "Although past investigations have made great strides towards identifying connections between climate patterns and TC activity in the Atlantic basin, such studies can be rather limited in scope due to the brevity of the observational record, which spans only from approximately AD 1851 to the present (Kozar et al., 2013). In addition, Kozar et al. (2013) point out that there is some disagreement in the literature about the reliability of the observational record. For example, Landsea (2007) argues for a potentially significant undercount bias in the observational record, particularly early in the observational record, due to the lack of observational data from satellites and other modern tools and data sources. Landsea et al. (2010) further expands on this idea, indicating that very short lived storms may have been unaccounted for early in the observational record. Additionally, Vecchi and Knutson (2008) find very mixed evidence for changes in Atlantic TC frequency during the twentieth century. Chang and Guo (2007) investigate the issue of long-term TC counts as well, but find that, although there may be a slight undercount bias prior to World War I, the number of TCs that may not be recorded is likely no greater than 10 storms per decade. Using a statistical model to relate annual frequency of TCs to climate state variables, Mann et al. (2007) reaches a similar conclusion as Chang and Guo (2007). Because the observational record of TC activity in the Atlantic is short and potentially biased, it is difficult to accurately assess low-frequency variability in storm activity; thus, it is desirable to turn to other means of assessing this variability. Using monthly mean thermodynamic state variables, including SST and vertical profiles of temperature and humidity, as well as daily mean values of interpolated 250 hPa and 850 hPa winds, Kozar et al. (2013) downscale a simulation from the NCAR CSM 1.4 model spanning the past millennium to generate a long-term synthetic TC data set consistant with a plausible long-term past climate scenario. Caveats related to the use of the NCAR CSM 1.4 in the Kozar et al. (2013) study include too much vertical wind shear in the Atlantic basin, cooler than expected North Atlantic SSTs, and a lack of lower stratospheric cooling, as seen recently in the observational record Vecchi et al., 2013). The downscaling method used by Kozar et al. (2013), developed in Emanuel et al. (2006) and Emanuel et al. (2008), is applied here to several of the more recent state-of-the-art CMIP5 models to perform further analysis of TC activity in the Atlantic basin. Downscaling to create TC datasets involves three main steps: genesis of storms, generating tracks for storms, and intensification of storms. These parts of the downscaling process are described in detail in Emanuel et al. (2006) and Emanuel et al. (2008). to analyze results from more than one model, we use the less-ideal monthly values of the wind fields from the CCSM4, IPSL, and MIROC models. In these cases, we allow winds to vary over the seasonal cycle, while fixing the variances and covariances at 1980 values. The choice of using 1980 values for fixed variances and covariances is arbitrary. Although it is preferable to have daily values of the 250 and 850 hPa wind fields for our downscaling process, we have investigated the sensitivity of the downscaling process to the use of monthly wind values, and find that results using monthly winds are reasonable, and similar to those produced using daily wind values. For example, consider the comparison of annual storm frequencies from the IPSL model in Figure 2.1. Here, we compare downscaled results for the annual number of TCs using daily wind values, denoted \"full winds\" (blue), and downscaled results for the annual number of storms using monthly winds with fixed variances (green) for the time period from AD 1850 -2005. As can be seen from the figure, the downscaled results from the two different methods track one another well. Results were similar for the CCSM4 and MIROC models, and suggest that it is reasonable to use monthly values of wind fields with fixed variances and co-variances for cases in which daily wind fields are not available. Finally, it is important to note a major caveat with respect to the MIROC model results, as values of SST from the MIROC model show an unexpected upward drift throughout the pre-anthropogenic era (AD 850 -1850). This problematic drift is a known issue with the last millennium run of the MIROC model (Bothe et al., 2013), and at this point is unresolved. Thus, we place little emphasis on results from the MIROC simulation at this time."}, {"section_title": "2.3: Results: PDI and Ocean Surface Temperature Metrics", "text": "As noted above, there have been a number of studies investigating the relationship between PDI and Atlantic SST. In particular, Emanuel (2005) indicates a strong direct relationship between PDI and Atlantic SST based on reanalysis data from 1950 -2005. Here, we compare PDI from storms in longterm (AD 850-2005) synthetic TC data sets to long-term records of SST from CMIP5 models. Although there are other important measures of TC destructiveness or power, such as size and strength of a storm, here we will focus on central intensity of storms, using PDI as a proxy for the power of each TC. Our goal is to establish whether or not a relationship between PDI and SST similar to what was found in Emanuel (2005) can be seen for spans of time greater than 56 years. In this work, we use SSTs, vertical ocean temperature profiles, and synthetic TCs downscaled from four CMIP5 models-MPI, CCSM4, IPSL, and MIROC. The MDR is defined to be the region bordered by 10 and 20 degrees north, and 20 and 85 degrees west (see Figure 2.2). In Figure 2.3, the smoothed time series of annually accumulated PDI from the synthetic TC data sets and the MDR SST from each of the models are shown. Here, and in subsequent discussion of smoothed data unless otherwise noted, the long-term data sets have been smoothed using a lowpass filter (Mann, 2008;Kozar et al., 2013) to emphasize timescales that are multidecadal or longer. The lowpass filter has a half-power cutoff at f = 0.025 cycles/year, equivalent to a 40 year period. Squared Pearson's Linear Correlation Coefficients (r 2 ) between smoothed MDR SST and PDI from each model are given in Table 2.1, for the full time series (AD 850-2005), the pre-anthropogenic era time series (AD 850-1800), and the anthropogenic era time series (AD 1800-2005). The degrees of freedom for the full smoothed time series is approximately N=29; thus r 2 values greater than 0.10 are significant at the p=0.05 level, and those greater than 0.18 are significant at the p=0.01 level. The degrees of freedom for the pre-anthropogenic smoothed time series is approximately N=24; thus r 2 values greater than 0.12 are significant at the p=0.05 level, and those greater than 0.22 are significant at the p=0.01 level. The degrees of freedom for the anthropogenic smoothed time series is approximately N=5; thus r 2 values greater than 0.57 are significant at the p=0.05 level, and those greater than 0.79 are significant at the p=0.01 level. Building on work from Emanuel (2005), Emanuel (2007) reports an r 2 value of 0.75 between smoothed MDR SST and PDI values in the Atlantic basin using observational and reanalysis data for the 56-year period from 1950-2005. Using CMIP5 model data over much longer time periods, we do not find nearly as strong of a relationship between MDR SST and PDI. This can be seen in both the time series plotted in Fig. 2.3, and their corresponding r 2 values given in Table 2.1. Only the r 2 values for the full and pre-anthropogenic time series from the IPSL model are significant at the p = 0.05 level. Even in these cases, only 15% (full time series) and 13% (pre-anthropogenic time series) of the variance in PDI values is explained by the relationship between PDI and MDR SST. Given that there is consensus among all four of our CMIP5 models that more than 80% of the variance in PDI values is unexplained by varying MDR SSTs, we choose to investigate the relationship between PDI and other surface temperature metrics from our models for the Atlantic basin. Thus, we consider the relationship between relative SST and PDI in the Atlantic basin. Here, relative SST is defined as: The smoothed time series of relative SST and annually accumulated PDI from the synthetic TC data sets for each of the models are shown in Figure 2.4. We find that, in some cases, r 2 values between relative SST and Atlantic PDI for the four models indicates a stronger relationship than the relationship between MDR SST and Atlantic PDI (Table 2.1). In the case of relative SST, r 2 values for both the full time series and pre-anthropogenic time series from both the CCSM4 and IPSL models are significant at the 99% level. Although these r 2 values indicate that more than 30% of the variance in PDI values may be related to varying relative SST, there is very little consensus across our models for the relative SST and Atlantic PDI relationship. Results from the MPI and MIROC models indicate almost no relationship between relative SST and Atlantic PDI (Table 2.1). Finally, we also consider the relationship between PDI and PI. As noted above, Emanuel et al. (2005) suggests that PI is the most appropriate measure of the thermodynamic environment for a TC; we are thus interested to see if we can find a relationship between PDI from our synthetic TCs and PI as calculated from the models. Here, PI is defined as in Emanuel (2007): where Vp is the potential maximum wind speed, or PI, Ck is the surface exchange coefficient for enthalpy, CD is the surface exchange coefficient for momentum, Ts is the SST, To is an entropy-weighted mean outflow temperature (Emanuel, 1986;Eq. (19)), k 0 * is the enthalpy of air in thermodynamic equilibrium with the ocean, and k is the specific enthalpy of air near the surface. Here the potential intensity has been calculated using the algorithm developed by Bister and Emanuel (2002). The smoothed time series of PI and annually accumulated PDI from the synthetic TC data sets for each of the models are shown in Figure 2.5. As with relationships between MDR SST and PDI, and relative SST and PDI, we find mixed results when considering the r 2 values associated with the relationships between PDI and PI on various time scales for our four models. We find that r 2 values between PDI and PI for the full time series are significant at the 95% level for the MPI, CCSM4, and IPSL models (Table 2.1); though, the most variance explained by any of these relationships is still only 17%. Additionally, we find significant relationships between PDI and PI for the CCSM4 and IPSL anthropogenic time series; however, results indicate almost no relationship between PDI and PI for the pre-anthropogenic time series (Table 2.1). The lack of consensus across our models towards any significant relationships between PDI and various Atlantic Ocean surface temperature metrics over long periods of time suggests the lack of a robust relationship between ocean temperature metrics and TC intensity in the Atlantic basin. However, we hypothesize that a stronger relationship between PDI and ocean temperature metrics may be evident on shorter time scales. Emanuel reports r 2 values between PDI and MDR SST for a time period of 56 years. For the purpose of comparing our results to Emanuel's findings, we now divide the  We can see from Figure 2.6 that, in general, R values found between PDI and MDR SST in our CMIP5 models are far lower than the R value found by Emanuel (2007). Additionally, there seems to be very little agreement between the R value reported in Emanuel (2007) and the R values from the CMIP5 models for the same time period. The variability in the R values for our four models, and their disagreement with the observed R value found in Emanuel (2007), highlights that fact that, as in all modelling work, our model results are likely affected by model biases, and are somewhat less reliable than observed data. In spite of this, however, we do note that the mean of the R value distribution for each model is greater than zero. Combined with the consensus from all four models that no significant relationship between MDR SST and PDI is evident on long time scales (Fig. 2.3, Table 2.1), the positive means of the R value distributions from all of our models suggest that, although it is weaker than expected, there is generally a positive correlation between PDI and MDR SST, but only for short time scales."}, {"section_title": "2.4: Results: TC Count Statistics", "text": "Investigating the changing intensities of TCs and the potential relationship of those intensities to climate variables is an issue of great importance, but it is also interesting to consider the TC frequency for a basin. The multiple long-term synthetic TC datasets at our disposal in this work provide an excellent tool for analyzing the relationship between basin-wide and landfalling TC counts for the Atlantic basin. Through our analysis of TC counts, we hope to gain further insight into the usefulness of paleohurricane records for analyzing long-term changes in TC activity within the Atlantic basin. We begin our investigation into the relationships between different subsamples of TC counts by considering the r 2 values that describe those relationships. Similar to the r 2 values that described the relationships between TCs and the environment in Table 2.1, Figure 2.7 displays the r 2 values that describe the relationships between various subsamples of smoothed TC count statistics for each model. The time series corresponding to each relationship in Figure 2.7 are shown in Figures 2.8 and 2.9. Here, a TC refers to a storm with winds of at least 40 kts; a hurricane refers to a storm with winds of at least 64 kts; and a major hurricane refers to a storm with winds of at least 96 kts. In Fig. 2.7, r 2 values greater than 0.10 are significant at the p = 0.05 level; r 2 values greater than 0.18 are significant at the p = 0.01 level. For every model, correlations between basin-wide TCs and total landfalling TCs, and basin-wide hurricanes and total landfalling hurricanes, are significant at the p = 0.05 level; all of these except for the correlation between basin-wide TCs and total landfalling TCs from the IPSL model are significant at the p = 0.01 level (Fig. 2.7). Correlations between basin-wide and total landfalling major hurricanes are significant at the p = 0.01 level for the CCSM4, IPSL, and MIROC models. To test the robustness of these relationships, we've run 10,000 bootstraps of each pair of data sets, and computed the r 2 values for each of the 10,000 random samples. The spread of these 10,000 r 2 values are illustrated by histograms in Fig. 2.7. As can be seen in the figure, the means of the bootstrapped r 2 values correspond to the actual r 2 values from our data; we thus conclude that the correlation between basin-wide and landfalling storms is robust. Weaker relationships exist between basin-wide TCs, hurricanes, and major hurricanes and their counterparts making landfall specifically in the United States (Fig. 2.7). We see that the correlations between basin-wide and U.S. landfalling storms across all categories of storms is significant at the p = 0.05 level for the CCSM4 model. For the IPSL model, the correlation between basin-wide and U.S. landfalling TCs is significant at the p = 0.05 level, while the correlation between basin-wide and U.S. landfalling hurricanes is significant at the p = 0.01 level. None of the correlations between basin-wide and U.S. landfalling storms are significant for the MPI or the MIROC models. The weaker correlations between basin-wide and U.S. landfalling storms as opposed to the correlations between basin-wide and total landfalling storms are not surprising, given that less of the Atlantic basin coastline is included in the former. However, we also note that there is quite a bit of variability in basin-wide and U.S. landfalling correlations among our four CMIP5 models. This variability across the models can be largely explained by different spatial biases found in the tracks of the synthetic TCs downscaled from each model. To illustrate spatial biases in TCs from our models, points of genesis for tracks from each of the models, as well as from observational data, are shown in Figure 2.10. "}, {"section_title": "2.5: Summary and Conclusions", "text": "Here we investigate correlations between TC intensity and ocean temperature metrics as well as correlations between basin-wide and landfalling TC counts from AD 850 -2005. Results from this study are, in some cases different than expected, and in other cases nearly as expected. Based on Emanuel (2005) and Emanuel (2007), we expected that we may be able to find a strong relationship between PDI and MDR SST for long-term synthetic TC datasets downscaled for the Atlantic basin from four different CMIP5 models. In reality, we found only a very weak, or in some cases, a non-existent direct relationship between PDI and MDR SST in our synthetic TC datasets for the past millennium. A similarly weak relationship between PDI and relative SST was found, and between PDI and PI. However, it is important to note that in our analysis of long-term relationships between PDI and ocean temperature metrics, we smoothed the data using a lowpass filter. If a direct relationship between PDI and ocean temperature metrics is only apparent for shorter timescales, our use of smoothed data for the past millennium simulations may contribute to the lack of a direct relationship between these variables on such timescales. Using a triangular filter (Emanuel et al., 2007) to analyze our synthetic TC datasets for shorter time periods of 56 years during the pre-anthropogenic era, we found that relationships between PDI and ocean temperature metrics in general, and PDI and MDR SST in particular, were still far weaker than the direct relationship between PDI and MDR SST found in Emanuel (2007) for a time period of identical length. However, using our model-derived synthetic TC datasets, we found that distributions of R values between PDI and ocean temperature metrics for running 56 year periods throughout the preanthropogenic era had positive means. Given the consensus of our four models about the lack of a strong direct relationship between PDI and MDR SST, but the overall positive mean of R value (Pearson Correlation) distributions for the pre-anthropogenic era, we conclude that a relationship between PDI and MDR SST may indeed exist, but it is likely a much weaker relationship than that found in Emanuel (2007). Complementing work by Kozar et al. (2013), our analysis of long-term basin-wide and landfalling TC count statistics provides additional support for the use of paleohurricane records in analyzing longterm basin-wide TC trends. We find significant correlations between basin-wide and landfalling TCs for nearly all categories of storms across all four of our models. Though affected by spatial biases in synthetic TC tracks from the CMIP5 models, we find that, for some models, significant correlations also exist between basin-wide and U.S. landfalling storms. Indications are that basin-wide storm activity is indeed directly related to landfalling storm counts; thus, we have increased confidence that paleohurricane records can be highly useful in analyzing long-term TC activity for the Atlantic basin (Donnelly, 2005;Scilepi and Donnelly , 2007;Woodruff et al., 2008;Mann et al., 2009;Park, 2012;Toomey et al., 2013). Unsurprisingly, a number of caveats related to downscaling apply to the work presented here. For example, although we required daily wind values for our downscaling method, we are here forced to interpolate based on monthly mean wind values from the model output for 3 of our 4 models. Additionally, the MIROC model used for one the downscaled synthetic TC datasets here has a clear and problematic drift in SST across the pre-anthropogenic era, causing us to place less emphasis on results from this model than others. Such imperfections in model data directly affect our downscaling process. Nevertheless, using the state-of-the-art CMIP5 last millennium climate model simulations, we are able to perform more comprehensive analyses of model-simulated climate/hurricane relationships than in previous studies. Our approach moreover provides a fruitful avenue for future research, whereby multimodel ensembles of long-term climate model simulations, combined with appropriate TC downscaling approaches, can lead to an increasingly improved understanding of the relationship between climate and TC activity."}, {"section_title": "2.6: Acknowledgements", "text": "The authors acknowledge funding for this study from NOAA Grant # 424-18 45GZ.

However, the observational record of tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic basin is too short (AD 1851present) to accurately assess long-term trends in storm activity. To overcome this limitation, we use proxy sea-level records, and downscale three CMIP5 models to generate large synthetic tropical cyclone data sets for the North Atlantic basin; driving climate conditions span from AD 850 to AD 2005. We compare pre-anthropogenic era (AD 850 -AD 1800) and anthropogenic era (AD 1970-AD 2005) stormsurge model results for New York City, exposing links between increased rates of sea-level rise and storm flood heights. We find that mean flood heights increased by ~1.24 m (due mainly to sea level rise) from ~AD 850 to the anthropogenic era, a result that is significant at the 99% confidence level. Additionally, changes in tropical cyclone characteristics have led to increases in the extremes of the types of storms that create the largest storm surges for New York City. As a result, flood risk has greatly increased for the region; for example, the 500 year return period for a ~2.25 m flood height during the pre-anthropogenic era has decreased to ~24.4 years in the anthropogenic era. Our results indicate the impacts of climate change on coastal inundation, and call for advanced risk management strategies."}, {"section_title": "3.2: Background", "text": "Tropical cyclones (TCs) and their associated storm surges are the costliest natural hazards to impact the U.S. Atlantic coast (Emanuel, 2005;Pielke, 2007;Rappaport, 2014). For example, Hurricane Sandy caused an estimated $50 billion of damage and destroyed at least 650,000 houses in 2012, largely because of flooding from a 3 -4 m storm surge and large waves (Blake et al., 2013). A storm surge is the anomalous rise of water above predicted astronomical tides, and its height is driven primarily by wind patterns, storm track, and coastal geomorphology forcing water onshore, with a smaller contribution from reduced atmospheric pressure allowing the ocean surface to rise. The financial cost and human impact of future storm surges will be controlled by the TC climate (frequency, intensity, size, duration, and location) and the rate of relative sea-level rise (RSLR), which is the base water level upon which storm surges occur (Tebaldi et al., 2012;. The flood height attained during a given storm is determined by combining storm surge, tides, and relative sea level. Therefore, as relative sea level rises through time, coastal inundation risk from storm surges rises as well. Thus, it is useful to conduct a long-term analysis of the impact of changing TC climates and RSLR on flood heights (Lackmann, 2015). The observational record of TCs in the North Atlantic Ocean basin spans AD 1851 to the present, but is too short (Kozar et al., 2013) and potentially unreliable (Landsea, 2007) to accurately assess longterm trends in TC frequency, intensity, and storm-surge height, particularly for the largest events and for locations which rarely experience landfalling TCs (e.g., Kozar et al., 2013;Landsea, 2007;Chang and Guo, 2007;Mann et al., 2007;Lin et al., 2014;Reed et al., 2015a). As an alternative to the observational record of TCs in the North Atlantic Ocean basin, Kozar et al., (2013), developed a long-term synthetic TC data set, downscaled from the NCAR CSM 1.4 model spanning the past millennium, which allows for more accurate assessment of low-frequency variability in TC activity over long periods of time. This process creates a long-term synthetic TC data set consistent with a reasonable past climate (Kozar et al., 2013;Reed et al., 2015a), and is described in detail in Emanuel et al., (2006) and Emanuel et al., (2008). Here we generate long-term synthetic TC data sets downscaled from the newer, state-of-the-art Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models. To perform our analysis, we use an interdisciplinary approach that combines TCs with simulated storm surges from a storm-surge model and proxy relative sea-level reconstructions of the last two millennia from southern New Jersey (Figure   3.1; . We examine changes in coastal flooding in New York City (NYC) using two time periods to provide a paleo-climate perspective of coastal flooding events such as Hurricane Sandy. We define the anthropogenic era to be a time period in which anthropogenic forcing can be assumed to be dominant (AD 1970(AD -2005; we choose the pre-anthropogenic era to be a time period in which anthropogenic forcing can be assumed to be minimal (AD 850 -1800). Our definition of the end of the time period for the pre-anthropogenic era is consistent with several different previous studies (Meinshausen et al., 2011;Taylor et al., 2012;IPCC, 2013)."}, {"section_title": "3.3: Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "3.3.1: Flood Heights in New York City", "text": "To estimate the effect of RSLR on flood heights in NYC since AD 850, we combined reconstructed relative sea level with the peak storm-surge height for each synthetic storm. The time series in Figure 3.1 shows RSLR during the last millennium from proxy reconstructions obtained from southern New Jersey (Figure 3.2), with sea-levels relative to the sea-level in AD 852 . The accelerated rate of RSLR during the anthropogenic time period (more than 6 times greater than that during the pre-anthropogenic time period) serves as motivation to compare the impacts of RSLR on flood heights during the anthropogenic era to the impacts of RSLR on flood heights during the preanthropogenic era for NYC. Relative sea-level for each year was determined using our relative sea-level time series, and was added to each of the simulated surge heights at The Battery for the storms from each of our three CMIP5 models (Figure 3.3). Non-linear interaction between RSLR and storm surge was shown to be very small for coastal areas of NYC using numerical modeling for a range of RSLR up to 1.8 m . Additionally, the effect of wave set-up for the region is expected to be small . Here we focus instead on the evolving variables of RSLR and storm surge. We assume that the influence of changing physiographic conditions is minimal during low rates of RSLR, and thus assumed a constant bathymetry and bed roughness during the last millennium (Irish et al., 2010;Woodruff et al., 2013). These intuitive results stress the increasing risk that coastal regions of the United States face due to the combination of RSLR and storm surges produced by TCs (Woodruff et al., 2013). This risk is amplified in NYC, where the rate of RSLR is greater than the global average due to contributions from regional-scale processes such as glacio-isostatic adjustment (GIA) (Peltier, 1996;Davis and Mitrovica, 1996;Miller et al., 2013). Regardless of uncertainty about the frequency, magnitudes, or tracks of future TCs, risk of coastal inundation for this region will increase as RSLR accelerates. However, it is possible that the risk of higher flood heights due to RSLR could be amplified or dampened by changing climatology of TCs and their resultant storm surges. To better understand this risk it is necessary to separate the effects of RSLR from changing storm-surge height, which results from the prevailing TC climatology."}, {"section_title": "3.3.2: Changing Storm-Surge Heights and Tropical Cyclone Characteristics from the Pre-anthropogenic Era to the Anthropogenic Era", "text": "To analyze the impact of changing TC characteristics on flood height, we now neglect the contribution of RSLR to flood height, focusing only on changing storm-surge heights. However, similar to  and Lin et al., (2010b), we find that the storm-surge height distributions yielded by our long-term synthetic TC data sets for NYC exhibit long tails. The large but rare events that make up these tails are an important component of determining and planning for the risk of coastal flooding in the NYC region since they are likely to result in the greatest impacts for a single TC event (Aerts et al., 2013). Thus, although the means of the pre-anthropogenic and anthropogenic era storm-surge height distributions are not statistically different from one another, it is possible that the frequency of extreme storm-surge events, and therefore the risk of coastal inundation, differs between the two time periods. To investigate differences in the tails of the storm-surge height distributions from the two time periods for each model, we created quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots, in which the quantiles of the normalized, pre-anthropogenic era storm-surge distribution are plotted against their counterparts from the normalized anthropogenic era storm-surge distribution for each model (Figure 3.5a-c). Storm-surge heights in the tails of the anthropogenic distributions are significantly higher than those in the tails of the pre-anthropogenic distributions for all three models (Fig. 3.5a-c). This indicates that the risk of extreme storm surges is greater in the anthropogenic era than in the pre-anthropogenic era for the NYC region. The possible reasons for the larger extreme storm surges in the anthropogenic era were explored using Q-Q plots for several characteristics of the synthetic TCs at the time-step for which each storm was closest to The Battery. Fig. 3.5d-f illustrates that tail values in the anthropogenic distributions of radius of maximum winds (RMW) for the synthetic TCs are larger in some of our models than their pre-anthropogenic counterparts. Additionally, Fig. 3.5g-l show that storms in the tails of the anthropogenic era distributions have lower minimum pressures and/or higher maximum winds than storms in the tails of the pre-anthropogenic era distributions in all three models. Furthermore, analysis of TC return periods by category illustrates that strong storms (category 3 or greater) tend to have shorter return periods in the anthropogenic era than in the pre-anthropogenic era for all of the models considered here, with the exception of category 5 storms in the IPSL model (Figure 3.6). The increase in the frequency of strong storms in NYC during the anthropogenic era corresponds to the increase in storm-surge heights during the same time period. For example, we find that for an average flood height of ~2.25 m, our models had a return period of approximately 500 years during the pre-anthropogenic era; the return period for this same flood height has been reduced to ~24.4 years in the anthropogenic era."}, {"section_title": "3.3.3: Types of Tropical Cyclones that produce flooding in New York City", "text": "Furthering our analysis of TC characteristics, we investigate the relationship between stormsurge heights and TC intensity and size. Extreme surges are often produced by intense storms with strong winds and low pressures. However, an increase in storm-surge heights may also be caused by an increase in the storms' RMW (although the intensity and RMW tend not to increase together for individual storms, as there tends to be an inverse relationship between these two quantities; (Chavas and Emanuel, 2014;Irish et al., 2008)). To further investigate how the storm surges vary with storm characteristics, we perform a principle component analysis (PCA) on the TC characteristics (RMW, storm minimum pressure, and storm maximum winds; Table 3.1) near The Battery that our work identified as likely having an impact on storm-surge heights. The PCA indicated that >96% of variance in surge heights across our two time periods and in all three models was described by two main types of storms. The first of the two storm types is characterized by large RMW, relatively low wind speeds, and non-extreme minimum pressures. We know from the observational record that large storms with relatively low intensity, such as those that have undergone extratropical transition, can induce large, long-lived surges at The Battery in NYC (Jones et al., 2003). Hurricane Sandy of 2012 is an example of this type of storm. When Sandy made landfall in southern New Jersey it had maximum winds of only ~70 kts, but was a very large (tropical-storm force winds extending about 870 nautical miles; (Blake et al., 2013)) and slow moving storm, capable of producing storm surge for an extended period of time in NYC (Brandon et al., 2014). The hazard posed by storms of this type is exaggerated, because their long-duration storm surges have an increased likelihood of overlapping with a high astronomical tide to produce correspondingly larger flood heights. The current great diurnal tidal range at The Battery is 1.54 m according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, indicating that the timing of a storm surge is a key control on the flood height attained during a TC event . Additionally, Lackmann (2015) indicated that changing thermodynamic conditions could ultimately contribute to stronger versions of large storms like Hurricane Sandy, further increasing the risk of coastal inundation from this type of storm. The second type of storm that contributes to significant variance in storm-surge heights at The Battery is characterized by smaller RMW, high wind speeds, and low pressures. These relatively intense storms also produce large surges (Weisberg and Zheng, 2006). The Hurricane of 1938 is a historic example of this type of storm impacting the region around NYC. At landfall, this TC was fast moving (~40 kts), had maximum sustained winds of ~105 kts, and a minimum pressure of ~941 mb (Landsea et al., 2014). The TC generated a flood height of 1.57 m at The Battery in NYC  and a peak flood height of more than 3 m in Long Island, New York (Donnelly et al., 2001)."}, {"section_title": "3.4: Conclusions", "text": "We adopted an interdisciplinary approach that uses proxy relative sea-level reconstructions, downscaled synthetic TC data sets, and storm-surge models to investigate the impacts of RSLR and TC characteristics on flood heights for NYC. Our results indicate that, compared to the pre-anthropogenic era, flood heights have increased during the anthropogenic era not only due to RSLR, but also due to changes in TC characteristics, leading to an increased risk of coastal inundation for NYC. When combining RSLR from our proxy sea-level record with storm surges generated by stormsurge models for our synthetic TCs, we see that flood heights at The Battery in NYC are significantly greater during the anthropogenic era than during the pre-anthropogenic era. We find greatly decreased return periods of flood heights across all three of our models when comparing the two time periods. The means of the anthropogenic flood height distributions are statistically greater than the means of the pre-anthropogenic flood height distributions by ~1.24 m at the 99% confidence level, due to RSLR. Additionally, we find an increased risk of higher surges during the anthropogenic era than during the pre-anthropogenic era for NYC even if RSLR is not considered. Though the means of the preanthropogenic and anthropogenic distributions of storm-surge heights are not statistically different from one another when RSLR is neglected, the storm-surge heights in the tails of the anthropogenic distributions are significantly greater than storm-surge heights in the tails of the pre-anthropogenic storm-surge distributions. Our study indicates that during the anthropogenic era, there are increases in the extremes of the types of storms that explain the majority of storm surge for NYC. First, when comparing our two time periods, there is an increase in storm RMW during the anthropogenic era in some of our models. While storms with large RMWs may not be particularly intense, they may produce winds capable of creating a storm surge at The Battery for extended periods of time. Additionally, we see more intense storms with a greater ability to produce high storm surges at The Battery in NYC during the anthropogenic era than during the pre-anthropogenic era. Our results indicate that storm-surge risk for NYC increased over the past millennium not only due to rising relative sea-levels, but also due to changes in TC characteristics, stressing the impacts of climate change on coastal inundation, and the necessity for risk management solutions in this highly populated region."}, {"section_title": "3.5: Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "3.5.1: Proxy Relative Sea-Level Records", "text": "We use an existing relative sea-level reconstruction from southern New Jersey  to describe the long-term baseline on which the simulated storm surges occur. The reconstruction was produced using foraminifera and bulk-sediment \u03b4 13 C values measured in cores of dated salt-marsh sediment from two sites located ~58 km apart (Cape May Courthouse and Leeds Point; Figure 3.2). The Cape May Courthouse record spans the period since ~AD 700 and the Leeds Point record spans the period from ~500 BC to ~AD 1600. Each reconstruction has a 2\u03c3 age uncertainty and a 1\u03c3 vertical uncertainty. The two reconstructions were combined to produce a single, regional relative sea-level record, which is what an observer at the coast would have experienced, and is the net outcome of multiple and simultaneous processes including GIA. A caveat of using this data set is that relative sea level differences between southern New Jersey and NYC may arise over decades to centuries because of spatial differences in the rate of GIA (Engelhart et al., 2011), the fingerprint of ice sheet melt (Mitrovica et al., 2011), and role of ocean currents including the strength and position of the Gulf Stream (Davis and Mitrovica, 1996;Yin and Goddard, 2013). Relative sea-level reconstructions produced from salt-marsh sediment do not preserve the seasonal to inter-annual variability that is evident in tide-gauge time series because biological sea-level indicators such as foraminifera and plants respond to longer lived trends and because the slices of sediment used in the reconstruction have a thickness (typically 1 cm) making them time averaged. Therefore, the proxy reconstruction records multi-decadal to centennial-scale relative sea-level trends. Seasonal and inter-annual sea-level fluctuations caused by temporary weather patterns (winds and pressure), coastal sea-surface temperatures and salinities, and ocean currents can produce fluctuations of up to ~0.3 m in addition to this trend, as evidenced by the size of annual-average relative sea level departures from the overall trend measured at The Battery tide gauge in NYC."}, {"section_title": "3.5.2: Synthetic Tropical Cyclone Data Sets", "text": "We apply the downscaling method developed in Emanuel et al., (2006), Emanuel et al., (2008), and Kozar et al., (2013) to three CMIP5 models: the MPI model, the CCSM4 model, and the IPSL model. The downscaling method used by Kozar et al., (2013) uses monthly mean thermodynamic state variables, including sea surface temperature and vertical profiles of temperature and humidity, as well as daily mean values of interpolated 250 hPa and 850 hPa winds to generate TCs and model their tracks and intensity (Emanuel et al., 2006;Emanuel et al., 2008;Kozar et al., 2013). Note that when modeling the intensity of downscaled TCs, RMW values are also calculated deterministically by the Coupled Hurricane Intensity Prediction System, or CHIPS model (Emanuel, 1989;Emanuel, 1995b;Emanuel et al., 2008). Our choice of models is dictated by the availability of the necessary thermodynamic and kinematic state variables from AD 850 -2005, although, for this time period, only the MPI model provides the daily wind fields required for our analysis. In the interest of considering results from more than one model, we use the less-desirable monthly values of the wind fields from the CCSM4 and IPSL models, in these cases fixing variances and covariances of winds at the arbitrarily chosen AD 1980 values, but allowing the winds to vary over the seasonal cycle (Reed et al., 2015a). A simple analysis revealed that long-term variations are well represented by the fixed covariance simulation (e.g., Fig. 1 in Reed et al., (2015a)). We require large numbers of TCs in order to perform a reliable statistical analysis of storm-surge heights. Therefore, we use a filter to generate about 10,000 storms for each model that pass within 250 km of the Battery in NYC (Fig. 3.2). Of these storms, approximately 5000 were generated in the preanthropogenic period and approximately 5000 were generated in the anthropogenic period. The overall event frequency is calculated from the ratio of the number of TC events simulated to the total number seeded. This ratio is multiplied by a universal calibration constant for each model, derived so as to produce the observed frequency of TCs during the late 20th century (Emanuel et al., 2008)."}, {"section_title": "3.5.3: Storm-Surge Modeling", "text": "We apply the Advanced Circulation (ADCIRC) model (Luettich et al., 1992) to simulate the storm surges induced by all synthetic storms.

It uses an unstructured grid with very fine resolution near the coast and much coarser resolution in the deep ocean.

The ADCIRC storm-surge modeling is driven by the storm surface wind and pressure fields. Given the characteristics (maximum wind speed, minimum central pressure, and RMW) of the synthetic storms, we estimate the surface wind and pressure fields along the storm track using parametric methods, similar to . In particular, the surface wind is estimated by fitting the wind velocity at the gradient height to an analytical hurricane wind profile (Emanuel and Rotunno, 2011), translating the gradient wind to the surface level with a velocity reduction factor (0.85) and an empirical formula for inflow angles (Bretschneider, 1972), and adding a fraction (0.55 at 20 degrees cyclonically) of the storm translation velocity to account for the asymmetry of the wind field induced by the surface background wind (Lin and Chavas, 2012).

Under a changing climate, the evolution of this risk depends not only on characteristics of tropical cyclones (TCs) and their resultant storm surges, but also on the rising sea levels upon which those storm surges occur (Reed et al., 2015a, Little et al., 2015. Using downscaled data from three Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 5 (CMIP5) global climate models and relative sea level reconstructions , Reed et al., (2015a) found that from the pre-anthropogenic era (850-1800 CE, prior to significant anthropogenic forcing on the climate) to the anthropogenic era (1970-2005 CE, a time period of dominant anthropogenic forcing on the climate), flood risk associated with storm surges from TCs in the New York City (NYC) region has greatly increased. As the climate continues to warm in coming centuries, and sea levels continue to rise, it is reasonable to expect that the coastal flood risk for NYC will continue to rise as well. At this time, we are likely committed to up to 2.3 m of additional sea level rise global mean (SLR) over the next two millennia (Levermann et al., 2013). In reality, this expected SLR may be greater, or occur more quickly than Levermann et al. (2013) predicts. Joughin et al. (2014) finds that the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) may already be underway, and could result in rapid global mean SLR of more than 1 mm per year anywhere between 200 and 900 years from the present. In another study, DeConto and Pollard (2016) find that, without changes to emissions, the collapse of portions of the AIS could produce more than 1 meter of sea-level rise by 2100, and more than 15 meters of sea-level rise by 2500. Additionally, storm characteristics may continue to change during and beyond the end of the next century . Considering this, as well as the increases in coastal flood risk that have already occurred for NYC over the past millennium (Reed et al., 2015a), an investigation of how flood risk associated with TCs may change for NYC in the coming centuries in the context of previous historical analyses will provide vital information necessary for NYC and surrounding communities to prepare and adapt for significant flooding events. Consistent with previous work, storm surge is defined here as the anomalous rise of water above predicted astronomical tide levels; flood height is defined as the combination of storm surge and relative sea level (RSL; Reed et al., 2015a). Storm surge height is primarily determined by a TC's wind patterns and track, coastal geomorphology, and, to some extent, the reduced atmospheric pressure associated with a storm. Storm surge heights are thus highly dependent upon the TCs that generate them, as they are significantly affected by TC characteristics, including intensity, size, duration, and location (Irish et al., 2008;Lin et al., 2010; "}, {"section_title": "4.2: Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "4.2.1: Changing Storm Characteristics", "text": "In a historical analysis, Reed et al. (2015a) found that between the pre-anthropogenic era and the anthropogenic era, storm surge heights increased at The Battery in NYC due to amplifications in two main types of storms: storms with large radii of maximum winds (RMWs; potentially large storms), and storms with strong winds and low pressures (intense storms). Thus, we begin our investigation into the future threat of TCs and coastal flooding in NYC by analyzing the ways in which we may expect storm surge heights to change in coming centuries, independent of projected SLR. Figure 1 shows the normalized distributions of storm surge heights for each of our three models (the MPI, CCSM4, and IPSL) for both the historical era (1970anthropogenic era in Reed et al., 2015a) and the future ( -2100. Additionally, the figure shows distributions storm surge heights for the IPSL model for both the anthropogenic era and the future, using a future simulation that extends beyond 2100 CE to 2300 CE. We find either very little or no change in the mean storm surge heights between the two time periods (CCSM4 model), or else slightly lower mean storm surge heights in the future distributions (MPI and IPSL models). However, since all of the distributions in fig. 1 have long, risk-determining tails, we further investigate changing storm surge heights by considering the quantiles of the distributions, which provide additional information about how tail values differ between the two time periods. Figure 2 shows QQ plots of storm surge heights, as well as each storm's RMW, minimum pressure, and maximum wind speed at the time when the storm is closest to The Battery. Quantiles from the historical era are plotted on the x-axes, and quantiles from the future eras are plotted on the y-axes. The figure illustrates that storm surge values in the tails of the historical era distributions tend to be larger than the corresponding values in the tails of the future distributions. However, in most cases, we also see decreasing pressures and increasing wind speeds in the tails of the distributions for the future compared to the historical era, signaling potentially more intense storms in the future; this apparent increase in intensity does not translate to a rise in storm surge. We hypothesize that rising storm intensities do not result in higher storm surges in our future TC and storm surge simulations due to a combination of decreasing RMW values and a shift in the tracks of storms that travel near the Battery in our future simulations. First, particularly in synthetic TCs from the MPI and CCSM4 models, we tend to see lower RMW values in the future than in the historical era. These smaller RMW values may be an indication of smaller storms, potentially driving the lower storm-surge heights in the future era in these cases. A principal component analysis (PCA) for this study supports this hypothesis, revealing that one of the two primary components influencing storm-surge variance in our models is characterized by storms with large RMW values, similar to PCA results presented in Reed et al., (2015a). The lower future storm surge heights driven by lower RMW values in this study are consistent with previous work investigating future storm surge and flooding in NYC . Using four CMIP3 models,  find mixed results when comparing future surge heights to historical surge heights in NYC. Although some models indicated increases in future storm tide (storm surge + astronomical tide), several of the models indicated decreases in future storm tides. As in this study, Lin et al., 2012, find increasing intensities of storms across all models to 2100; they hypothesize that a primary reason for the decreasing storm tide in many situations is that RMW values tend to decrease in these cases as intensity increases. Second, in our models, we appear to see a shift in the tracks and winds of storms that travel near The Battery in future simulations. This shift in tracks can be seen in Figure 3, which shows the multi-model mean of the difference in track densities from 2081-2100 CE compared to track densities from 1981-2000 CE. Fig. 3 indicates that synthetic storms generated for future simulations in our models tend to be steered off shore, often avoiding a direct hit on NYC and The Battery. Further, we find that mean winds from the storms at The Battery become slightly slower ( Figure   4b) and more westerly ( fig. 4c) with time, and that the minimum distance between our storms and The Battery tends to increase over time ( fig. 4d), lending support to the hypothesis that shifting storm tracks may be impacting surge heights. Though fig. 4 shows changes in wind characteristics and minimum distance between TCs and The Battery only for the IPSL model, we note that a similar, though less dramatic shift can also be seen in future simulations to 2100 in the MPI and CCSM4 models. It appears that a change in sea level pressure fields may be partially responsible for this changing TC behavior.  fig. 5a). These pressure differences intensify by the end of the 23 rd century in the IPSL model. This type of change in sea level pressure patterns would support an eastward shift in TC tracks, away from The Battery, providing a possible explanation for lower extreme storm surge heights in future compared to historical simulations. It should be noted that we are using a limited number of global climate models (GCMs) in this particular study. We use the subset of climate models used by Reed et al., (2015a) here to evaluate future changes to TC-related flood risk in NYC in the context of the historical analysis presented in Reed et al., (2015a). Thus, it should be noted that results presented here are specific to our subset of GCMs, and it is possible that an investigation using a different subset of GCMs could produce slightly different results. A full understanding of future changes to TC tracks and the influences behind any such changes requires further investigation using additional models and tools."}, {"section_title": "4.2.2: Changing Flood Heights", "text": "As we move towards the future, it is possible that shifting storm tracks and lower RMW values could spare NYC from increases in the most severe storm surge heights. Although some uncertainty remains about the behavior of future TCs and their resultant storm-surge heights, sea levels are expected to continue rising for at least the next several centuries, likely off-setting any potential decreases in storm-surge heights (Fig. 2), and compounding growing flood risk associated with any potential increases in storm-surge heights that could occur without a shift in storm tracks. Thus, we now turn our attention to the ways in which we may expect flood heights in NYC to change in coming centuries. Though it is generally accepted that we can expect sea levels to continue to rise over the next several centuries, the actual magnitude of SLR we may expect at both global and regional scales remains somewhat uncertain (Haigh et al., 2014,;Horton et al., 2014;Church et al., 2013 (IPCC AR5); Kopp et al., 2014;Nicholls and Cazenave, 2010;Greenbaum et al., 2015;Levermann et al.

Figure 7 shows distributions of future flood heights at The Battery in NYC for the MPI, CCSM4, and IPSL models. In order to view these results in the context of the historical analysis presented in Reed et al., (2015a), future sea level from our SLR projections (Kopp et al., 2014;DeConto and Pollard, 2016) for each year was determined relative to a pre-anthropogenic era baseline (Reed et al., 2015a;, and was then added to each of the simulated storm surge heights for each of the "}, {"section_title": "4.3: Conclusions", "text": "Using an interdisciplinary approach that combines downscaled TC simulations, storm surge models, proxy SLR records, and various SLR projections, we expect significantly increasing risk of coastal flooding associated with TCs in NYC in the coming centuries due to rising sea levels.

By 2300, mean flood heights could increase by as much as ~1.26-~5.57 meters. These results are significant at the 99% confidence level. Our results indicate that, although the overall flood heights associated with TCs at The Battery in NYC are likely to increase significantly in coming centuries, NYC may be spared from increases to the most extreme storm surge heights, largely due to both decreasing RMW values in some models, as well as an easterly shift in storm tracks that can be seen to varying degrees across all models considered in this study. This shift in storm tracks is supported by both measurements of TC wind characteristics near The Battery, and measurements of minimum storm distance from The Battery. Additional work is needed to fully explain the reasons for the shift in TC storm tracks in future simulations; however, it appears that a change in sea level pressure patterns in future climate simulations may be a contributing factor. Our simulated TC results suggest that, in coming centuries, NYC may actually experience decreases in the most extreme storm surge heights; however, overall flood heights (storm surge combined with sea level) will continue to increase due to rising relative sea levels, greatly increasing the "}, {"section_title": "4.4: Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "4.4.1: Future Sea Level Rise Projections", "text": "To describe the future sea levels upon which simulated storm surge events occur, we use 10,000 Monte Carlo samples to describe SLR projections for the NYC region in Kopp et. al., (2014) for both the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 climate scenarios.

Specifically, results of this work highlight connections between basin-wide and landfalling TC activity, as well as connections between storm intensities and ocean temperature metrics, using longer time scales and a greater variety of climate models than have been previously used in the exploration of such relationships. Additionally, this work provides useful tools to improve our understanding the changing risk of coastal inundation in NYC as a result of SLR and changing TC characteristics in a changing climate. Results from our investigation of correlations between TC intensity and ocean temperature metrics as well as correlations between basin-wide and landfalling TC counts from AD 850 -2005 are in some cases different than expected, and in other cases nearly as expected. Although, based on previous work (Emanuel, 2005;Emanuel, 2007) we expected that we would be able to find a strong relationship between PDI and MDR SST for long-term synthetic TC datasets downscaled for the Atlantic basin from four different CMIP5 models, we found only a very feeble to nonexistent direct relationship between PDI and MDR SST in our basin-wide synthetic TC datasets for the past millennium. We found similarly weak relationships between PDI and other ocean temperature metrics, such as PDI and relative SST, and PDI and PI. However, if a direct relationship between PDI and ocean temperature metrics is only apparent for shorter timescales, as our work seems to indicate, our use of smoothed data for the past millennium simulations may contribute to the lack of a direct relationship between these variables on such timescales. To investigate this possibility, we use a triangular filter as in Emanuel et al., (2007) to analyze our synthetic TC datasets for shorter time periods of 56 years during the pre-anthropogenic era. In doing so, we found that a relationship between PDI and MDR SST may indeed exist, but that relationships between PDI and ocean temperature metrics in general, and PDI and MDR SST in particular, are still far weaker in our model data than those reported in previous work using observational data (Emanuel, 2007). In addition to an investigation of long-term relationships between PDI and ocean temperature metrics, our analysis of long-term basin-wide and landfalling TC count statistics finds significant correlations between basin-wide and landfalling TCs for nearly all categories of storms across all four of our models providing additional support for the use of paleohurricane records in analyzing long-term basin-wide TC trends. Though results are impacted by spatial biases in synthetic TC tracks from the CMIP5 models, we find that, for some models, significant correlations also exist between basin-wide and U.S. landfalling storms. Our results indicate that basin-wide storm activity is directly related to landfalling storm counts, increasing confidence that paleohurricane records can be highly useful in analyzing long-term TC activity for the Atlantic basin (Donnelly, 2005;Scileppi and Donnelly, 2007;Woodruff et al., 2008;Mann et al., 2009;Park, 2012;Toomey et al., 2013). In our more localized analysis of long-term changing TC characteristics, storm surge heights, and flood risk for NYC, we use an interdisciplinary approach that combines proxy relative sea-level reconstructions, future SLR projections, downscaled synthetic TC data sets, and storm-surge model results to investigate changing flood heights for NYC during both the past millennium and in coming centuries. Our results indicate that, compared to the pre-anthropogenic era, flood heights have increased during the anthropogenic era not only due to RSLR, but also due to changes in TC characteristics, leading to an increased risk of coastal inundation for NYC. Although results relating to changes in TC characteristics that may lead to increased surge heights in the future are less certain, we nevertheless find a further increased risk of coastal flooding in NYC through the year 2300 due to rising relative sea levels. When combining RSLR from our proxy sea-level record with storm surges generated by stormsurge models for our synthetic TCs, we find significantly greater flood heights at The Battery during the anthropogenic era than during the pre-anthropogenic era, and even greater flood heights in coming centuries than in the present. Additionally, we find greatly decreased return periods of flood heights across all three of our CMIP5 models when comparing the pre-anthropogenic and anthropogenic time periods. We find further decreases in return periods of flood heights in future projections, where the precise magnitudes of decreasing return periods are dependent upon the SLR scenario being considered. The means of anthropogenic flood height distributions are statistically greater than the means of the pre-anthropogenic flood height distributions by ~1.24 m at the 99% confidence level, due to RSLR, and the means of future flood height distributions are statistically greater than the means of historical flood height distributions by ~0.24-~0.97 m at the 99% confidence level, due to RSLR. Additionally, we find an increased risk of higher surges during the anthropogenic era than during the pre-anthropogenic era for NYC even if RSLR is not considered. Though the means of the pre-anthropogenic and anthropogenic distributions of storm-surge heights are not statistically different from one another when RSLR is neglected, the storm-surge heights in the tails of the anthropogenic distributions are significantly greater than storm-surge heights in the tails of the pre-anthropogenic storm-surge distributions. We do not see a similar increase in tail area storm surge events produced by our models for simulations over historical simulations, largely due to an unexpected shift in storm tracks eastward of The Battery; however, if such a shift were not to exist, it is likely that we would see increases in the highest storm surge heights in future simulations extending to 2300. Our study indicates that during the anthropogenic era, there are increases compared to the preanthropogenic era in the extremes of the types of storms that explain the majority of storm surge for NYC. First, when comparing our two time periods, there is an increase in storm RMW during the anthropogenic era in some of our models. While storms with large RMWs may not be particularly intense, they can produce winds capable of creating a storm surge at The Battery for extended periods of time. Additionally, we see more intense storms with a greater ability to produce high storm surges at The Battery in NYC during the anthropogenic era than during the pre-anthropogenic era. Our results indicate that storm-surge risk for NYC increased over the past millennium not only due to rising relative sea-levels, but also due to changes in TC characteristics. In the coming centuries, it is possible that shifting storm tracks could spare NYC from increases in severe storm surge heights; however, rising relative sea levels are likely to greatly increase overall flood heights, regardless of changes in TCs and their resultant storm-surge heights. These results stress the impacts of climate change on coastal inundation, and the necessity for risk management solutions in the highly populated NYC region."}]
