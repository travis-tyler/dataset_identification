Abstract | Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are clinically grouped by severity: mild, moderate and severe. Mild TBI (the least severe form) is synonymous with concussion and is typically caused by blunt non-penetrating head trauma. The trauma causes stretching and tearing of axons, which leads to diffuse axonal injury -the best-studied pathogenetic mechanism of this disorder. However, mild TBI is defined on clinical grounds and no well-validated imaging or fluid biomarkers to determine the presence of neuronal damage in patients with mild TBI is available. Most patients with mild TBI will recover quickly, but others report persistent symptoms, called post-concussive syndrome, the underlying pathophysiology of which is largely unknown. Repeated concussive and subconcussive head injuries have been linked to the neurodegenerative condition chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which has been reported post-mortem in contact sports athletes and soldiers exposed to blasts. Insights from severe injuries and CTE plausibly shed light on the underlying cellular and molecular processes involved in mild TBI. MRI techniques and blood tests for axonal proteins to identify and grade axonal injury, in addition to PET for tau pathology, show promise as tools to explore CTE pathophysiology in longitudinal clinical studies, and might be developed into diagnostic tools for CTE. Given that CTE is attributed to repeated head trauma, prevention might be possible through rule changes by sports organizations and legislators.\nNATURE REVIEWS | DISEASE PRIMERS VOLUME 2 | 2016 | 1 PRIMER \u00a9 2 0 1 6 M a c m i l l a n P u b l i s h e r s L i m i t e d , p a r t o f S p r i n g e r N a t u r e .

Patients with persisting symptoms (>3 months) are diagnosed with post-concussive syndrome (PCS) Repeated mild TBIs and subconcussive head impacts have been associated with the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), particularly in contact sports athletes and military veterans 10 . Notably, CTE is a neuropathological diagnosis that requires post-mortem examination, given that no established or validated clinical criteria and no biomarkers to support the diagnosis ante mortem are available, but criteria for the clinical counterpart -traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (TES) -have recently been suggested 11 . A progressive neurological condition in retired boxers called 'punch drunk syndrome' , which was believed to be linked to repetitive head blows, was initially described in 1928 (REF. 12 ), following which the condition was called 'dementia pugilistica' (REF. 13 ), before being referred to as CTE in the 1940s [14] [15] [16] . In 1973, a neuropathological study showed that dementia pugilistica was associated with widespread neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain 17 , which were later known to be composed of aggregates of paired helical filament (PHF)-tau. The first case report of CTE in a former American football player was described in 2005 (REF. 18 ), following which CTE pathology was identified in other contact sports athletes, such as ice hockey, soccer and rugby players and wrestlers. CTE pathology has also been documented in soldiers exposed to explosive blasts, although the number of cases is limited 19 . Amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques have been found in ~50% of CTE cases and are significantly associated with age and the inheritance of the APOE (which encodes apolipoprotein E) \u03b54 allele 20 . This Primer discusses mild TBI and concussion in adults, together with the relationship between mild TBI and PCS and CTE. We regard TBIs as a spectrum of severities, with mild TBI being the least intense, instead of separate entities. However, other types of injuries (such as contusions or haemorrhages) can occur in severe TBI owing to the more-extensive mechanical forces involved. The data from mild TBI (including those in athletes) have not been evaluated in either humans or animal models to the extent that moderateto-severe TBI has been studied. However, we find it unlikely that there is any pathophysiological distinction between the different TBI severities and think it plausible that the same underlying cellular and molecular processes are involved, just to different degrees."}, {"section_title": "Epidemiology", "text": "The incidence of hospital-admitted TBIs has been estimated at ~262 cases per 100,000 individuals in a metaanalysis from 16 European countries 21 . The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have reported an increase in the number of TBI-related emergency department visits from 567 cases per 100,000 individuals in 2000 to 824 cases per 100,000 individuals in 2010 (REF. 22 ). The incidence of TBI has increased in middleincome and low-income countries, which is mostly attributable to inadequate motor vehicle and traffic laws and safety regulations 23 . The true incidence of TBI is probably higher than the reported data, given that the incidence of mild TBI, which probably accounts for 80-90% of all TBIs, is underestimated in most studies 4 . A large, state-wide, population-based study conducted in the United States has reported that >40% of participants had at least one TBI during their lifetime 24 .\nThe most common causes of TBIs of any severity are falls and road traffic accidents, which together account for >50% of all cases 21, 22, 25 . The rate of TBIs tends to be higher among men than among women, with the peak incidence among adults in the oldest (>75 years) age groups 21, 22, 25 . Surveillance data indicate that the incidence of sports-related TBI visits to emergency rooms in the United States is 152 cases per 100,000 individuals, with almost two-thirds occurring in children and young adults <19 years of age and numbers increasing in both males and females 26 . In addition, military service members represent a unique at-risk group owing to training and combat-related activities 27 ; according to the US Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center, >22,000 service members sustained a TBI in 2015, of which 82% were mild.\nStudies have shown that the negative outcomes of TBIs (for example, disability, poor life satisfaction and memory impairment) increase in prevalence with increasing TBI severity 24 . Such studies have also suggested an association between TBIs and the risk of dementia. Indeed, a meta-analysis of 15 case-control studies reported an association between head injury and the risk of Alzheimer disease (odds ratio: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.21-2.06) 28 . However, these studies are based on patients with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer disease, which are unreliable and did not involve patients with Alzheimer disease confirmed on autopsy or with biomarkers (such as A\u03b2 PET or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)). Thus, the type of dementia associated with TBI is unclear. In addition, although several studies have demonstrated a dose-response relationship, such that the risk of dementia increases with increasing severity of TBI 29, 30 , the risk of dementia associated with mild TBI is unknown 31 . Investigating the risk of dementia with mild TBI might be difficult as mild TBI is under-reported and the defin ition is often not uniform across studies 31 . Age at the time of TBI could also be an important factor for dementia risk. One study reported an inter action between age and TBI severity, such that the risk of dementia was greater among older adults with mild TBI, whereas moderate and severe TBI was associated with an increased risk of dementia across all age groups 32 . A large study on dementia risk in veterans showed that TBIs in veterans \u226555 years of age imposed a 60% increase in dementia risk, even after compensating for other risk factors and potential confounders 33 . Epidemiological evidence is also incomplete on the association between repetitive TBIs and the risk of CTE. Although cognitive and behavioural changes are reported among contact sports athletes who experience repetitive TBIs 34 , no estimates for the prevalence or incidence of CTE are available. In particular, it should be noted that knowledge is lacking on the risk increase following repetitive subconcussive head impacts (without loss or impairment of consciousness) in contact sports athletes who sustain hundreds to thousands of head impacts during a season. Furthermore, that no biomarkers exist to clinically identify CTE or differentiate this disorder from Alzheimer disease or other neurodegenerative diseases is a limitation of these studies."}, {"section_title": "Mechanisms/pathophysiology", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Biophysical mechanisms", "text": "Understanding how the physical forces from an external blow to the head are transmitted through the brain should shed light on the pathogenetic processes of TBI and how this disorder can affect physiological functions.\nBrain damage in TBIs is caused by rotational (angular) and/or linear (translational) acceleration forces, or by blunt trauma with impact deceleration (FIG. 1) .\nThese forces generate intracranial pressure gradients through the inertia of the brain that lags behind the skull during the rapid movement. These pressure gradients generate shearing and strain forces that stretch and damage axons, leading to axonal injury, which, when multifocal, is called diffuse axonal injury (DAI) 35 . Whether different types of acceleration and deceleration forces cause axonal damage by different mechanisms is unclear; either focal strains or strains due to differences in densi ties between different parts of the brain (for example, the cortex and the underlying white matter) might be at play 36 . Indeed, biomechanical studies have shown that higher stress and strain forces can be observed in the bottom of the sulci in the frontal, parietal and temporal cortices 37 , which also matches the location of tau pathology in CTE 38 . Exactly how shearing forces cause axonal damage is not known. However, in non-human primates, the severity of DAI was shown to be directly proportional to the severity of brain injury, which was measured by the severity of symptoms and functional outcomes 39 . Moreover, axonal injury occurs after brain acceleration or deceleration forces, not secondary to other types of injury, such as ischaemia or inflammation. The severity of concussion in contact sports is also related to the force of the impact to the head, for example, the degree of head acceleration following impact in American football 40 . In addition, in boxing, the rotational acceleration force caused by a punch increases in heavier weight classes 41 . Interestingly, a punch by a professional boxer has been estimated to generate the same force on impact as being hit by a 6 kg bowling ball rolling at 20 mph 42 ."}, {"section_title": "Neuropathology", "text": "Neuropathological changes found after concussion (mild TBI) include mild multifocal axonal injury together with activation of microglia (the resident innate .

The multifocal axonal injury typically involves the fornices, corpus callo sum, subcortical white matter and cerebellum 45 . Less-consistent findings include TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43)-immunopositive neurites and small focal accumulations of PHF-tau, either as NFTs or neuropil threads 45 . The neuropathology of CTE involves both gross morpho logical and microscopic changes. For example, gross alterations, such as cavum septum pellucidum (a space between the layers of the septum pellucidum) or septal pellucidum fenestrations, are common pathological findings in CTE that are thought to represent traumatic damage to the septum from CSF wave shifts that occur with linear and rotational acceleration. In the recent US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke consensus criteria on CTE neuropathology 46 , the pathognomonic lesion of CTE was defined as irregu lar, perivascular accumulation of phosphorylated tau (P-tau) aggregates in neurons and astrocytes that clustered at the depths of cortical sulci (FIG. 2) . This hallmark tau lesion distinguishes CTE from other neurodegenerative tauopathies, including Alzheimer disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and argyrophilic grain disease. Tau abnormalities in CTE often involve the superficial cortical layers of the frontal, temporal and parietal cortices. TDP43 accumulation, A\u03b2 accumulation and dot-like and spindle-shaped neurites can also be observed 38 . A staging scheme of progressive PHF-tau pathology in CTE has been proposed, which consists of four stages (stages I-IV), and will be important for studies of CTE prevalence and its relationship with the number and severity of repeated mild TBIs 47 . A recent review of >1,700 brains from a neurodegenerative disease brain bank found CTE pathology in one-third of the brains of contact sports athletes, but no CTE-type changes were found in 162 controls or in 33 individuals with a history of a single TBI 10 .\nOther pathological abnormalities include deposits of phosphorylated TDP43, which have been observed in 80% of cases, especially in later stages of CTE, and occasionally colocalizes with PHF-tau, axonal injury and neuroinflammation 47, 48 . In addition, ~50% of CTE cases have deposition of A\u03b2 as either diffuse or neuritic plaques (also known as senile plaques) and ~14% of CTE cases are comorbid for Alzheimer disease 20 . Brains from individuals with CTE have been shown to be fourfold more likely to have A\u03b2 plaques and to develop plaques 10-15 years earlier than those from a community-based autopsy cohort. Moreover, the presence of A\u03b2 plaques has been shown to be significantly associated with more-severe PHF-tau and poor clinical status before death, independent of the age of the patient 20 ."}, {"section_title": "Cellular and molecular pathophysiology", "text": "Axonal injury. Studies of the molecular pathophysiology of TBIs have examined many factors, including neuronal cell death, astrocyte injury, astrocyte and microglial responses, dendritic injury and synaptic dysfunction. Notably, much of the field has focused on axonal injury, especially multifocal axonal injury or DAI (FIG. 3) , largely because of the clinical and experimental observations that link the severity of DAI to the extent of disability following TBIs 49 . For example, multifocal axonal injury is consistently revealed by amyloid precursor protein (APP) immunohistochemistry in TBI of all severities, given that APP accumulates at sites of axonal injury with axonal transport failure 43, 44 . Moreover, the depth of coma has been shown to be directly proportional to the extent of axonal injury in the brainstems of non-human primates following rotational acceleration injury 39 ; similar observations have been reported in a pig model 50 . In addition, several investigators have demonstrated a correlation between the severity of axonal injury (assessed using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and biomarker-based measure ments of axonal injury) and outcomes in patients with mild TBI or those with more-severe injuries 51, 52 . Axonal injury can be detected immediately after injury when forces of sufficient magnitude are applied to the brain. Microtubule disruption has been shown within 2 minutes after rapid stretch of the axons of cultured neurons 53 , which can cause the formation of axonal varicosities (distorted and irregular axonal swellings or local dilations), as a result of failed axonal transport. Indeed, axonal varicosities are the most common manifestation of axonal injury and show accumulation of APP. Similar axonal varicosities are a hallmark of traumatic axonal injury observed in patients with TBI 54, 55 . Axons in general, and microtubules specifically, might be more mechanically brittle than other structures in the nervous system, although this idea has not been rigorously tested. The dynamic instability of microtubules might also contribute to microtubule disruption and failed axonal transport in TBIs 53 , but the role of microtubule disruption in other cellular structures, such as dendrites, has yet to be established. Other investigations have revealed additional manifestations of axonal injury 56, 57 . For example, cytoskeletal neurofilament compaction has been observed in the brains of rats and humans with TBI 58, 59 . The mechanisms underlying neurofilament compaction include disruption of the plasma membrane, which leads to increased intracellular calcium levels, activation of calpains and caspases and cytoskeletal proteolysis, including cleavage of spectrin and neurofilament side arms 60 . Another form of axonal injury involves axonal collapse and has been detected in mice after experimental mild TBI 61 . The mechanisms underlying axonal collapse remain to be determined.\nImportantly, not all forms of axonal injury result in the disconnection of axons 62 ; injured axons can remain connected, although whether these axons are functional is unknown. Notably, the extent of traumatic axonal injury can be greatly underestimated in studies using thick-section light microscopy, which can only visualize dilated axons and axonal varicosities. Non-dilated, injured axons require electron microscopy or ultra-thin section-based approaches for detection 63 . To our knowledge, studies using super-resolution light microscopy of injured axons have not yet been reported."}, {"section_title": "A\u03b2 accumulation.", "text": "A\u03b2 is a key component of plaques that are found in patients with Alzheimer disease and is produced by sequential cleavage of APP by \u03b2-secretase 1 and the \u03b3-secretase complex (with presenilin 1 constituting the active site) 64 . As previously mentioned, a link between TBIs and Alzheimer disease has been suggested. Two major hypotheses regarding the mechanisms underlying this increased risk have been proposed 65 ; one states that TBIs reduce cognitive reserve such that the same pathophysiological processes underlying Alzheimer disease cause detectible symptoms at an earlier age. The second hypothesis is that TBIs directly set into motion the tau and A\u03b2 pathophysiological processes underlying the development of Alzheimer disease (the accelerated A\u03b2 hypothesis). These two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive.\nIn support of the accelerated A\u03b2 hypothesis, diffuse A\u03b2 plaques have been observed in some patients with severe TBI at younger ages than would be expected 66, 67 .\nIn addition, experimental TBI in pig models has been shown to cause formation of diffuse A\u03b2 plaques and intra-axonal deposition of A\u03b2"}, {"section_title": "68", "text": ". The origin of the diffuse plaques is unknown, but studies have indicated that the levels of soluble extracellular A\u03b2 decrease acutely after TBI and then recover as neurological function is restored, which is probably owing to the recovery of synaptic activity 69, 70 . This recovery phase might also explain the delayed increase in the levels of A\u03b2 that is observed in the ventricular CSF in patients with acute TBI 71 . By contrast, acutely increased levels of A\u03b2 have been observed in tissue lysates following experimental injury in mice 72 ; this discrepancy might be due to partial mixing of increased intracellular and decreased extracellular A\u03b2 pools in tissue lysates 70 . The increase in the levels of intra-axonal A\u03b2 is believed to arise from the aberrant colocalization of APP, \u03b3-secretase complex and \u03b2-secretase 1 at the sites of failed axonal transport 73 . Inhibition of \u03b3-secretase prevents TBI-related intra-axonal A\u03b2 formation in mice, but does not affect the overall severity of axonal injury 74 . Studies that investigated the pathophysiology of agerelated Alzheimer disease have emphasized the role of soluble oligomeric assemblies of A\u03b2 as key mediators of synaptic dysfunction and memory loss that underlie Alzheimer disease 75 . However, the effects of TBIs on A\u03b2 oligomers remain to be determined."}, {"section_title": "Tau aggregation.", "text": "Tau aggregates observed at postmortem examination are a key finding in CTE. Tau is a microtubule-stabilizing protein and upregulation of tau after TBI has been hypothesized to be an aberrant attempt to stabilize microtubules that are disrupted by the trauma. An alternative hypothesis is that aberrant phosphorylation of tau leads to loss of its normal microtubule-binding function and promotes aggregation. In other contexts, A\u03b2 aggregates might induce tau phosphorylation and aggregation 76 , but in a mouse model of TBI, a 90% reduction in A\u03b2 levels had no effect on TBI-related tau aggregation 74 . By contrast, c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation colocalized with tau aggregates and JNK inhibition reduced TBIrelated tau aggregation 77 . Thus, the mechanisms underlying TBI-related tau aggregation might be distinct from the mechanisms elucidated in other contexts. Other pathophysiological changes. The inflammatory responses to TBI are major pathophysiological events that might affect outcomes in complex ways. Microglia are dramatically activated in the first days to a week after trauma and can either be transiently or persistently activated 78, 79 . However, the mechanisms underlying microglial activation and the roles of microglia and astrocytes in debris removal, repair, recovery, progressive degeneration and long-term neurodegenerative sequelae remain to be determined 80 . Furthermore, the current categorization of microglia into M1 'classic ally activated' and M2 'alternatively activated' subtypes might be inadequate for the characterization of responses to TBI 81 . The soluble cytokine response is dramatic in patients with TBI 82 , which supports the notion that inflammation might be a therapeutic target for TBIs, at least in severe injury 83 . After TBI, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species damage proteins, lipids and nucleic acids in the brain. Early after injury, oxidative and nitrosative stress might be due to, for example, activation of the arachidonic acid cascade or nitric oxide synthase, or mitochondrial dysfunction in severely injured regions of the brain 84 , but it is not as clearly involved in less severely injured areas or in concussive injury. Specific mitochondrial lipid oxidation has recently been demonstrated and might have an important role in apoptotic cell death 85 . The effects of delayed oxidative and nitrosative stress caused by microglial and other inflammatory cellular responses are just beginning to be explored 86 ."}, {"section_title": "Genetic factors", "text": "Genetic factors can influence both short-term survival and long-term neurological and functional outcome after TBI by affecting several different putative pathogenetic pathways. Short-term survival might depend on genetic variants that can influence the severity of axonal injury, inflammation, blood-brain barrier disruption and neuronal survival. Long-term outcome might depend on genes that have a role in neuronal regeneration and plasticity. Indeed, studies have shown associations with outcomes following TBI between poly morphisms in genes that have a role in neuronal plasticity, for example, BDNF (which encodes brain-derived neurotrophic factor), and the inflammatory response, for example, the interleukin (IL) genes 87 . The most examined gene for short-term and longterm prognosis after TBI is APOE, which encodes APOE. APOE is involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism and is a main component of plasma lipoproteins. In addition, APOE is the principal apolipoprotein in the central nervous system and is involved in the recycling of plasma lipoproteins to build new neuronal cell membranes, neurites and synapses during regeneration in response to brain injury 88, 89 . APOE has three alleles (APOE \u03b52, \u03b53 and \u03b54), the most common of which is the \u03b53 allele. The \u03b54 allele is a well-established and strong susceptibility gene for risk and age of onset of Alzheimer disease 64 , and might also influence prognosis or rate of progression of other brain disorders 90 . An association between poor shortterm clinical outcome after TBI and the \u03b54 allele has been found in some studies, but these associations are weak and variable and several studies have reported no effect 87 . Preclinical studies have suggested that APOE might affect the severity of axonal injury; mice with the \u03b54 allele showed larger numbers of dilated, APPstained axons than mice with the \u03b52 allele or \u03b53 allele 91 . In addition, several clinical studies have suggested that the \u03b54 allele predicts poor long-term (between 6 and 12 months) clinical outcome after TBI, which has been verified in a recent meta-analysis that showed an effect, particularly in severe TBI 92 . Studies examining APOE and the risk of eventual CTE-like symptoms are scarce. One study of retired professional boxers with high exposure to head blows revealed that carriers of the \u03b54 allele had more-severe symptoms of chronic brain injury (as a proxy for CTE) 93 than non-carriers. Other studies have found lower cognitive performance in high-exposure American football players who carry the \u03b54 allele 94 and ~50% of individuals with CTE were found to carry the \u03b54 allele in a small study 38 . The mechanisms underlying the putative association between APOE and the risk of CTE might involve isoform-dependent effects on neuronal regeneration and plasticity or be linked to a build-up of tau or A\u03b2 pathology. In Alzheimer disease, the leading hypothesis is that A\u03b2 aggregation and clearance are differentially regulated by the APOE isoforms 95 . Considering that A\u03b2 plaques are preferentially found at a late stage of CTE 38 , mechanisms related to \u03b2-amyloidosis are unlikely to be involved in the initiation of disease. Further large clinical studies are warranted to verify and explore the mechanisms for the association between APOE and eventual development of CTE, and to identify new genes that are associated with risk. Diagnosis, screening and prevention TBI severity Acute TBI severity is classified primarily by the level of consciousness of the patient, which is measured by the lowest post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score 96 . The GCS score consists of subscale scores for behaviours (such as eye opening and verbal and motor responses to questions and painful stimuli), with a higher total score indicating a higher level of consciousness of the patient. For example, the total score for the best eye opening, verbal response and motor response ranges from 3 to 15, with a sum score of 3 indicating total unresponsive ness and 15 indicating the best response (totally conscious). However, as some components of the GCS are untestable or cannot be tested reliably (for example, if the patient is intubated), clinicians are recom mended to report subscale scores for individual patients 97 . In a patient in coma or with moderate impairment of consciousness, the GCS is generally repeated at specific times, especially during the initial hospitalization; once a patient's consciousness recovers to a GCS score of 15, it is not repeated. The GCS score correlates with clinical outcome and disability, but prediction is enhanced by taking into account age, pupillary reactivity and the type of pathology noted on CT and/or MRI. Thus, in the clinical setting, clinicians should consider the use of brain radiographic imaging, other neurological findings (such a pupillary response) and fluid biomarkers in addition to the GCS score for the classification of TBIs, patient monitoring, management and prognosis 97 ."}, {"section_title": "Clinical characteristics of PCS and CTE", "text": "Patients with symptoms that persist for several months after mild TBI are classified as PCS. However, PCS is difficult to diagnose as no objective diagnostic tools are available. In addition, symptoms of PCS (BOX 2) are common in healthy individuals, as well as in those with pre-existing psychiatric conditions, such as anxiety and depression. Furthermore, these symptoms are influenced by personality, psychological factors 9 and demographic Nature Reviews | Disease Primers Figure 3 | Axonal injury in traumatic brain injuries. Axonal injury following brain trauma involves a complex set of pathophysiological events, which have been partially characterized. For example, rapid mechanical stretch can cause microtubule disruption (the nature of which is unclear) and impair axonal transport, which can cause varicosity formation. Membrane leakage can involve membrane rupture, transient poration or loss of ion channel selective permeability. The net effects of these changes can be axonal disconnection, which leads to impaired synapse function, and aberrant colocalization of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2), amyloid precursor protein (APP), \u03b2-secretase (BACE) and presenilin 1 (PS1). APP is processed by BACE and PS1 to produce A\u03b2. Rapid mechanical stretch or injury can also induce another injury cascade, which begins with membrane leakage and leads to increased levels of intra-axonal calcium (Ca 2+ ), calpain-mediated and caspase-mediated spectrin proteolysis, neurofilament compaction and axonal collapse.\nfactors, such as social status, sex, ethnicity and alcohol use 98 , which might also affect the rate of recovery after mild TBI.\nAs mentioned, CTE is a post-mortem diagnosis associ ated with varying clinical features before death and without established biomarkers. Diagnostic criteria for TES were recently suggested 11 . These criteria are based on the exclusion of other neurological disorders that could account for delayed-onset progressive cognitive, psychiatric and neurological symptoms in patients with a history of repetitive concussive or subconcussive head trauma exposures. These criteria have not been validated against neuropathology but are currently undergoing evaluation in a large longitudinal study.\nIndividuals who are later found to have CTE tend to have begun playing their sport during childhood and adolescence and played for >5 years. Symptoms associated with CTE can present at varying ages, but one-third of individuals are symptomatic at the time they retire from sport and, in most cases, the condition advanced slowly over several decades 38 . Retrospective descriptions of symptoms suggest three primary subtypes: first, behavioural and/or mood changes (such as irritability, depression and sleep disturbances); second, cognitive deficits (such as poor attention, memory problems, executive dysfunction and dementia); and third, a mixed-feature subtype 99 . Motor deficits (such as Parkinsonism, ataxia and dysphasia) also occur, and were described in former boxers with dementia pugilistica 17 . However, pending results of current prospective, longitudinal studies of at-risk athletes with a control group suggest that these descriptions should be interpreted as preliminary. For further details on sports-related concussion, see BOX 3. Endocrine complications. The most common endocrine complications following TBI are related to injury of the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland itself is well protected within the sella turcica of the sphenoid bone, but the pituitary stalk (which is connected to the anterior pituitary gland and hypothalamus) is vulnerable to the mechanical forces of TBI. Post-traumatic hypopituitarism (PTHP; decreased secretion of hormones from the pituitary gland after brain injury) is found in ~30% of patients with TBI, with a higher prevalence in more-severe injuries 100 . The most common abnormalities are growth hormone deficiency and hypogonadism, whereas adrenocorticotropic hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone deficiencies are diagnosed less often 101, 102 . Indeed, a large proportion of patients with TBI have vasopressin deficiency that is severe enough to cause central diabetes insipidus in the acute phase, but this deficiency often resolves within 3 months 102, 103 . PTHP can result in a multitude of acute and chronic symptoms 104 . For example, growth hormone deficiency can result in changes in body composition and reduce quality of life (QOL), including the development of depression, whereas hypothyroidism can cause weight gain, low mood and blunted cognition 104 . Most crucially, acute adrenal insufficiency can occur within days of TBI, causing hypotension, hyponatraemia and hypoglycaemia, which require immediate treatment. PTHP is also relevant in the context of mild TBI; 1% of patients with a history of concussion have growth hormone deficiency 105 and 25-30% of amateur kick-boxers and retired American football players have hypopituitarism with growth hormone and adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiencies, which might result in poor QOL, erectile dysfunction and metabolic syndrome 104, 106, 107 . Similarly, 42% of military personnel with previous blast-related mild TBI have abnormal levels of one or more pituitary hormones 108 . Given the subtle nature of some of the symptoms of endocrine complications, screening strategies in patients with a history of TBI have been proposed 109, 110 ."}, {"section_title": "Imaging", "text": "CT is fast and can accurately detect essentially all life-threatening and surgically treatable intracranial haemorrhages in patients with TBI 111 . However, CT cannot detect DAI and provides only modest information about prognosis. Indeed, even if CT is part of the diagnostic criteria, many patients with mild TBI who are evaluated in the emergency department, in addition to most cases of sports concussion, do not undergo any structural brain imaging. In addition, 28% of patients with normal brain imaging on CT have lesions on MRI that is performed in the research setting within 2 weeks of the trauma, with lesions (such as contusions and/or multifocal haemorrhagic axonal injury) associated with worse outcome 112 ."}, {"section_title": "Box 3 | Sports-related concussion", "text": "Concussion in sports is diagnosed based on subjective symptoms. According to consensus diagnostic criteria, sports-related concussion or mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) 4 is a transient disturbance of brain function due to a sports-related head blow or trauma, which causes acceleration or deceleration of the head followed by the onset of post-concussive symptoms. Although loss of consciousness occurs in <10% of sports-related concussions 4 , these injuries, in addition to non-sports-related mild TBI, are often followed immediately (or within minutes to hours) by the onset of one or more post-concussive symptoms.\nMany athletic programmes in the United States conduct pre-season 'baseline' assessments that measure self-reported symptoms, balance and cognitive performance, which is interpreted relative to the athlete's pre-season test scores. Following sports-related concussion, this assessment is repeated to identify and grade the severity of symptoms and signs of acute concussion and the cognitive deficit relative to baseline values. Concussion symptoms and cognitive performance are monitored while the athlete completes a concussion management programme. Loss of consciousness, the duration of post-traumatic amnesia (if present), the number and severity of acute post-concussive symptoms predict time for recovery 219 . When the athlete becomes asymptomatic at rest, light exercise and cognitive activity are resumed and gradually increased. If symptoms return, the level of exercise and cognitive activity is reduced to the previous asymptomatic level 4 . Otherwise, the athlete resumes non-contact training, followed by a return to contact training and competitive play. The time from injury to return to play is 7-10 days in 85% of collegiate athletes after their first concussion, but might be delayed in athletes with persistent symptoms. In these cases, a multidisciplinary approach by health care providers with experience in sports-related concussion is important, and coexistent disorders should be considered and evaluated, for example, by neuropsychological testing and CT and/or MRI scans to exclude structural pathology. Owing to the lack of tools to grade neuronal injury, the actual time period for a safe return to play is unknown, but might be longer than imagined. Indeed, a case report of a knocked-out boxer has suggested that ongoing axonal damage and dysfunction (assessed as high levels of neurofilament light in the cerebrospinal fluid) might be extended over several months 220 . Concomitant injuries to other body regions and depression can also delay return to play.\nMRI-based techniques. MRI provides superior anatomical detail, more-sensitive detection of smaller haemorrhages and improved information about prognosis compared with CT 111 . However, MRI is less clinically available and has longer scan times than CT. Furthermore, conventional MRI sequences have little ability to detect axonal injury (FIG. 4) and are usually normal in patients with mild TBI. Consequently, extensive efforts have gone into developing improved MRI sequences that are more sensitive to axonal injury.\nDTI is the leading MRI sequence for the detection of axonal injury 52, 113 (FIG. 4) . DTI measures the diffusion of water, which can be used to calculate the directional asymmetry (termed anisotropy) of water diffusion. Normally, the diffusion of water molecules occurs more readily parallel to the primary direction of the axons and less in perpendicular directions. Thus, healthy axons have high anisotropy. However, following axonal damage, the diffusion of water can be more hindered in the parallel direction than in perpendicular directions, such that injured axons have lower anisotropy than uninjured axons. In experimental animals, the extent of reduced anisotropy has been shown to quantitatively correlate with the extent of axonal injury, assessed using immunohistochemistry 111, 114 . In addition, reduced anisotropy after TBI of all severities has been reported in a large number of clinical studies at different time points after injury, even when CT and conventional MRI showed no evidence of axonal injury 113, 115 . Indeed, reductions in anisotropy in specific white matter tracts have been shown to correlate with TBI-related cognitive deficits 116 and the levels of tau in the brain extracellular space, which is a biomarker of axonal injury 117 . Limitations of DTI include its relative insensitivity to detect injury in complex white matter regions where there is not one predominant direction of the axons, inconsistencies concerning reported increases in anisotropy in some mild TBIs and the lack of spatial resolution to detect injury in small white matter tracts 118 . Furthermore, DTI needs standardization across different MRI scanners, which means that control data on each scanner is required for each study.\nNovel diffusion imaging methods, such as diffusion kurtosis imaging 119 , high angular resolution diffusion imaging 120 , high-definition fibre tracking 121 and diffusion spectrum imaging 122 , might be even more sensitive at detecting axonal injury, but probably have similar limitations as DTI. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy can resolve alterations in brain metabolism after TBIs and has been shown to correlate with metabolite concentrations and outcomes 123, 124 . Functional MRI (fMRI) can also reveal alterations to the brain after TBIs, such as areas of either reduced or increased activation and altered connectivity 125 . Magnetoencephalography (MEG) detects changes in magnetic fields caused by the electrical activity of the brain. The time resolution of MEG is considerably better than fMRI and allows the resolution of fast activity and transient changes in functional connectivity. Following TBI, MEG can detect abnormalities that were not identified with DTI or conventional MRI, and results obtained from MEG can correlate with clinical outcome 126, 127 . However, MEG is available at only a few centres, has limited spatial resolution (similar to DTI) and cannot yet be readily standardized between sites.\nPET imaging. PET ligands have been developed that bind to aggregated A\u03b2 and give a measure of the amount of A\u03b2 deposits in different brain regions compared with a reference region (the cerebellum, which virtually lacks fibrillar A\u03b2 plaques). Patients with Alzheimer disease typically show a 50-70% increased ligand retention in cortical regions compared with elderly controls 128 . Except for the 11 C-labelled A\u03b2 ligand (known as Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)), which has a short half-life that hinders its use outside specialized research centres, 18 F-labelled amyloid tracers with longer half-lives (including florbetapir, flutemetamol and florbetaben) have also been developed.\nA pilot study using PiB PET showed increased PiB retention, which reflects increased A\u03b2 deposition, in the cortical grey matter and striata in young-to-middleaged patients with moderate-to-severe TBI compared with controls, up to 1 year post-trauma 129 . Another small study showed increased PiB retention in the precuneus, posterior cingulate cortices and cerebella of patients with severe TBI, 11-17 months after injury 130 . PiB depo sition in the posterior cingulate cortex correlated with decreasing fractional anisotropy assessed -c) , DTI reveals a reduction in diffusion anisotropy (arrows; part d) and, therefore, evidence of axonal injury after concussive or mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). In a member of the US Military who experienced blast-related concussive TBI, DTI reveals neuronal abnormalities through a reduction in relative anisotropy (part e), indicated by a less-bright green colour (arrows; part f) that were not detected with conventional T2-weighted MRI (part g and part h). Using high spatial resolution DTI in a control without TBI, the individual white matter tracts can be distinguished from each other and from surrounding structures more clearly than using lower spatial resolution DTI seen in part a and part c (part i). by DTI, but ligand retention deposition was much lower than that found in patients with Alzheimer disease 130 . No stud ies on amyloid PET in individuals with mild TBI have been reported. PET using 18 F-labelled fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) can be used to measure glucose uptake and metabolism in different brain regions. Perturbed brain FDG-PET is found in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease, and psychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder 131 . A general trend to increased glucose metabolism in variable brain regions during the acute phase, followed by a prolonged hypometabolism during the subacute-to-chronic phase has been observed in patients with moderate-to-severe TBI 132 . Mild TBI is less well-studied and findings are variable.\nSeveral tau PET tracers with a high binding affinity and selectivity for PHF-tau deposits in the brain have been developed 133 . Tau PET is currently being evaluated in Alzheimer disease and has shown promise in monitor ing the development of tau pathology and improving the understanding of the disease pathophysiology 134 . However, no clinical studies using tau PET in patients with TBI or clinically suspected CTE have been performed. Large longitudinal clinical studies in patients with TBI and patients with PCS and suspected CTE are important to learn the frequency of A\u03b2 and tau deposits, at what point after TBI these deposits develop and how they correlate with other measures of neuronal damage, clinical symptoms, disease stage and prognosis."}, {"section_title": "Fluid biomarkers", "text": "For acute TBI, biomarkers can be used to grade the severity of brain damage, predict prognosis, guide clinical management, monitor therapeutic interventions and -in sports-related TBI -guide return-to-play decisions. CSF, serum and plasma are all of relevance for the detection of fluid biomarkers in patients with TBI, whereas biomarkers in other fluids such as saliva and urine are not yet established. Optimal biomarkers for TBI should reflect the pathophysiological processes.\nCSF biomarkers. CSF sampling through a ventricular catheter from patients with severe TBI who are in need of intracranial pressure monitoring is used in clinical proof-of-concept studies to evaluate candidate CSF biomarkers. The high sensitivity of CSF biomarkers to detect even minor brain damage in patients with negative CT and/or MRI might give important information about the pathophysiology of mild TBI. Lumbar puncture might be difficult to implement in the clinic for evaluation of patients with acute mild TBI, as the procedure might be considered invasive. This concern was also noted for CSF biomarkers for early diagnosis of Alzheimer disease, but increasing scientific data supporting both the safety of lumbar puncture and the high performance of biomarkers for early diagnosis are increasing their use for diagnostic purposes of Alzheimer disease in clinical practice 135 . Candidate biomarkers for use in patients with TBI include markers of neuronal damage (for example, tau, neurofilament light (NF-L), A\u03b2, neuron-specific enolase (NSE; also known as \u03b3-enolase) and spectrin-\u03b1 chain (also known as \u03b1II-spectrin)), blood-brain barrier integrity, the immune response and astrocyte function (such as S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)).\nThe most established CSF biomarkers for axonal injury are total-tau (T-tau) and NF-L (a structural protein that is mainly expressed in large calibre myelinated axons) 136 . Studies have shown that T-tau concentrations in the ventricular CSF correlate with lesion size and outcome in severe TBI, such that high levels indicate worse injury 136, 137 . One pilot study has shown increased concentrations of T-tau and P-tau in the ventricular CSF during the acute phase of severe TBI 138 . Studies of mild TBI have shown increased concentrations of both T-tau and NF-L in the CSF, but the concentrations of NF-L increased more than T-tau, suggesting that mild TBI affects long, myelinated axons more than short, non-myelinated axons 139, 140 . In addition, amateur boxers with concussions have been shown to have high levels of NF-L in the CSF after a match, even if they were not knocked-out. Higher levels of NF-L were observed with increasing numbers of hits to the head and NF-L levels reduced towards control levels after a period of rest 139, 140 . Interestingly, these boxers had negative MRI scans, suggesting that the detection of increased levels of NF-L in the CSF is enough to identify even minor axonal damage.\nAs previously mentioned, APP and A\u03b2 have been shown to accumulate in neurons and axons after TBI with axonal damage 15 . Ventricular CSF and brain interstitial fluid concentrations of two isoforms of A\u03b2 (A\u03b240 and A\u03b242) have been shown to increase during the first week after severe TBI 71, 141 , particularly in patients with DAI 142 . Similar results have been obtained for soluble isoforms of APP 71 . However, no amyloid-related changes have been observed in the lumbar CSF of patients with mild TBI 139, 140 . NSE is a glycolytic enzyme that is enriched in neuro nal cell bodies 143 . NSE concentrations are higher in the ventricular CSF sampled within 3 days following the injury of patients with severe TBI who did not survive than in those who survived and have been shown to corre late with TBI severity in both adults and children 144, 145 . However, the major limitation of assessing the levels of NSE in the CSF as a biomarker for neuronal injury is the high concentration of NSE in erythrocytes, which might contaminate the sample 146 . Spectrin-\u03b1 chain is found in neuronal axons and presynaptic terminals in the brain 147 . Spectrin-\u03b1 chain is proteolytically processed into fragments that have been suggested as potential TBI biomarkers both in animal experimental studies and in humans 148, 149 . The levels of spectrin fragments in the ventricular CSF have been shown to correlate with clinical correlates of injury severity and predict outcomes in patients with severe TBI 150 . In addition, the levels of spectrin breakdown products in the CSF have been evaluated with the levels of ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L1 (UCHL1) 151 , a de-ubiquitylating enzyme that is highly expressed in neurons 152 .\nOther biomarkers for TBI include markers of bloodbrain barrier function and inflammatory markers of injury. An increased CSF:serum albumin ratio -a standard biomarker of blood-brain barrier dysfunction -has been reported in patients with severe TBI 153, 154 . In mild TBI, no changes in the CSF:serum albumin ratio have been observed 139, 155 , which suggests that the blood-brain barrier remains intact or only 'opens up' transiently. A large number of studies have reported an acute-phase response in the central nervous system follow ing severe TBI, which can be reflected by increased concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 in the CSF 156, 157 . Markers of astrocyte function might also be used as biomarkers for TBI. The levels of protein S100B -an astrocyte-enriched calcium-binding protein -are slightly increased in the CSF of amateur boxers after one or several matches, but these changes are less pronounced than those for the axonal markers T-tau and NF-L 140 . Similar results have been reported for GFAP 139, 140 , which is an intermediate filament that is almost exclusively expressed in astrocytes 143 . The levels of GFAP have also been evaluated in the CSF of patients with severe TBI, and when used in conjunction with clinical data can improve the predictive power of outcome models 151 ."}, {"section_title": "Blood biomarkers.", "text": "On the basis of the CSF biomarkers above, candidate blood biomarkers for TBI include spectrin fragments, GFAP, UCHL1, S100B, T-tau and NF-L.\nStandard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for T-tau and NF-L have been transferred onto the single molecule array (Simoa; Quanterix, Lexington, Massachusetts, USA) platform, which enables the ultrasensitive measurement of these proteins in the blood 158, 159 . The Simoa assay for serum NF-L levels has been shown to have a 100-fold better analy tical sensitivity than standard ELISA to measure the levels of NF-L in the CSF 160 . The concentration of T-tau in plasma correlates poorly with concentrations in the CSF 161 , but has been shown to be predictive of cerebral function in patients with acute hypoxic brain injury 158 . Increases in the serum levels of T-tau and P-tau have been described during the acute phase of severe TBI, follow ing which the levels have been shown to decrease for up to 6 months but do not reach levels that are observed in controls 138 . In addition, in those with sports-related concussion, plasma T-tau levels have been found to predict return-to-play time with high accuracy 162 . Serum NF-L levels correlate strongly with the levels of NF-L in the CSF and have been shown to increase over time in American football players over the course of a season 163 . One study has shown a 30-fold increase in the serum levels of NF-L in patients with severe TBI, with higher levels of NF-L tightly correlating with DTI measures of DAI 164 , suggesting that serum NF-L levels might serve as a measure of severity of axonal injury in patients with TBI.\nSpectrin fragments have been shown to accumulate in damaged axons following TBIs 165 . Spectrin fragments can be measured in blood samples and levels have been shown to increase after TBIs, even in patients with mild TBI with no abnormal findings on CT 166, 167 , and has been suggested as a biomarker of prognosis and return-to-play time for sports-related concussion 168 . Guidelines for the use of S100B levels in the blood for the initial management of mild TBI have been published 169 , which aim to reduce the number of unnecessary CT scans in patients who are at low risk of intracranial complications, such as haemorrhage or swelling, that might require neurosurgical intervention. These guidelines were recently validated in a large multicentre study; S100B had a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 34% for the identification of intra cranial haemorrhages confirmed by CT scans 170 . However, some studies have found no change in the serum levels of S100B in patients with mild TBI and abnormal findings on CT compared with those with normal CT 171 and only minor changes in the serum levels of S100B in boxers or ice hockey players with concussion 140, 162 . The levels of GFAP and UCHL1 in the blood might be used to discriminate between patients with TBI and healthy controls 172, 173 . In addition, higher levels of UCHL1 and GFAP have been found in patients with TBI who have abnormalities on CT than in patients without abnormalities on CT 172, 174 . A large study of patients with mild-to-moderate TBI showed that GFAP levels can be used to detect intracranial lesions on CT and to identify patients in need of neurosurgical interventions, but the performance was lower for UCHL1 (REF. 175 ). Another study showed similar performance for GFAP, UCHL1 and S100B to identify abnormalities on CT in patients with mild-to-moderate TBI 176 . Few studies on the use of these biomarkers in patients with mild TBI have been performed, but one study found higher levels of GFAP in patients with mild TBI and abnormalities on CT 171 ."}, {"section_title": "Management", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Acute TBI", "text": "At the scene of injury and in the emergency centre, patients undergo an urgent assessment of the risk of developing an intracranial haemorrhage or brain swelling, which includes a brief interview and neurological examination (including GCS), to determine whether a CT scan is indicated 177, 178 . Factors that should prompt referral for a CT scan include loss of consciousness or reduced sensorium after an initial lucid interval, focal neurological signs or seizures, suspected skull fracture, older age, comorbid conditions and the use of anticoagulant medication 178 . Observation for 6-8 hours in the emergency centre and repeat neurological assessment might be an alternative to CT, for example, in patients with high GCS scores and no focal neurological signs. With increasing use of anticoagulants among older adults in the general population, concern exists as to whether these patients have a greater risk of delayed intracerebral haemorrhage following mild TBI, if their initial CT is normal. However, repeat CT to detect intracerebral haemorrhage has been deemed unnecessary, except in patients with severe TBI, patients showing neurological deterioration and patients on vitamin K antagonist anticoagulation medication 179 .\nIn the United States, following sports-related concussion, an athletics trainer or other clinician often directs clinical management\n. However, for nonsports-related mild TBI, emergency department discharge instructions provide management guidance, but follow-up is not the standard of care. Patient and caregiver education, including verbal and written instructions for identifying complications of TBI, observation by an adult for 24 hours, a regimen of rest and gradual resumption of activities, is the standard of care for mild TBI at many centres. The regimen of rest includes suspension from contact sports or other activities that risk head impacts or re-injury and initially extends to any vigorous physical activity and might also include intensive cognitive activity. The clinical management and follow-up of patients treated for mild TBI varies depending on several factors, such as the policy of the emergency department, the treating physician and the identification of risk factors for delayed recovery. Concerns about this approach to concussion management include the lack of precise definitions of rest, ambiguities in its implementation and evidence that durations of rest longer than 2-3 days might be deleterious to recovery 180 . Indeed, translational research has indicated that the gradual introduction of exercise can promote neuroplasticity after concussion 181 . However, further research is necessary to more precisely determine the duration and definition of rest depending on the injury features, concussion and head impact history, as well as pre-injury characteristics.\nModifiers of the effects of concussion include age, previous concussion and sex, among others. Young adoles cents and children are at risk for slower recovery than university and professional athletes, whose symptoms typically resolve within 2 weeks 4 . Prior sportsrelated concussion is a risk factor for prolonged recovery, but the evidence is mixed 4 . Similarly, some but not all studies indicate that women have a longer trajectory for resolution of post-concussion symptoms than men 4 . Similar to non-sports-related mild TBI, pre-existing neuropsychiatric conditions might complicate recovery from sports-related concussion 8 . The early post-injury period is associated with the release of excitotoxic neurotransmitters, a neurometabolic crisis (due to increased energy demand of the brain despite a reduction in cerebral blood flow), inflammation and axonal dysfunction 182 . A second mild TBI that occurs before the resolution of the pathophysiological changes following the first injury might add cumulative damage to the brain and prolong recovery from the second injury 183, 184 . This 'window of vulnerability' to re-injury has been cited as the rationale for prescribing rest for sports players who experience head trauma Persistent symptoms of CTE With sparse prospective, longitudinal studies of athletes exhibiting persistent symptoms associated with repeated sports-related concussion and/or repetitive head impacts, few evidenced-based guidelines for the clin ical management of symptoms that might be related to CTE pathology are available. Thus, the current knowledge of clinical decision making in these patients relies on retrospective clinical histories in neuropathologically confirmed cases of CTE 99 . For the development of long-term effects of repeated TBIs detected years to decades after retirement from sports, symptoms of mood and cognitive impairment and the age of the athlete relative to the typical duration of their playing career might be relevant 185 . In addition, the position played by the athlete and the number of years played professionally and in university provide an index of their exposure to repetitive head impacts After mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), the brain has increased susceptibility for a new injury during the recovery phase, termed the 'window of vulnerability'. A second mild TBI before the full resolution of pathophysiological changes following the first injury might add cumulative damage to the brain and prolong recovery from the second injury as compared with two injuries that are well-spaced apart during a prolonged period of rest. a | In a case of two TBIs, a second TBI that occurs after an extended period of rest, with normalization of the pathophysiological changes from the first TBI, enables normalization of the pathological changes of the second injury back to baseline (before any injury). b | In a case of two TBIs in which the second injury occurs during the window of vulnerability (before normalization of the pathophysiological changes of the first TBI), prolonged recovery and incomplete normalization after the second TBI might occur. This window of vulnerability is the rationale for recommending extended return-to-play periods after a concussion in contact sports athletes.\nthat might correlate with biomarker evidence of brain injuries 163 . More detailed neurological and neuropsychological assessments, together with MRI using advanced sequences, might identify evidence of brain damage that might guide whether to consider recommending an athlete to retire from sport.\nIn general, many clinicians would advise an athlete to retire from contact sports after sustaining multiple (more than two) concussions, especially if the injuries were temporally contiguous, for example, within a single season. However, the evidence base for this decision is weak and there is concern that years of exposure to repetitive head impacts are sufficient to initiate a self-perpetuating neurodegenerative process. With a latent period estimated to be 8-10 years, it is likely that the initial, preclinical stage of CTE pathology is thought to be undetected by conventional imaging methodologies or clinical assessments 47 . The dilemma for the clinician and the athlete is that current evidence does not permit estimation of the threshold of exposure to repetitive TBI episodes for initiating this neuro degenerative process. Moreover, individual differences in genotype, age when exposed to contact sports and other vulnerabilities, including medical and social history, might predispose individuals to developing CTE pathology (FIG. 6) . Recently developed tau ligands for PET imaging in Alzheimer disease can estimate the burden of tau in the cerebral cortex, but validation of this technique in individuals at high risk for, or symptoms that might indicate, CTE pathology is pending. In combination with other brain imaging modalities, fluid biomarkers and monitoring neurobehavioral changes, it might soon be possible to identify CTE pathology at a preclinical stage."}, {"section_title": "Quality of life", "text": "Life satisfaction following TBI can vary over time and is associated with several factors. The levels of cognitive and physical disability of the patient are related to injury severity 186 , but can also include contextual factors, such as income, mood, fatigue and social participation 187, 188 . In the first 6 months post-injury, patients typically report low life satisfaction with a gradual improvement over years. Locus of control (that is, the degree to which individuals believe that their health is controlled by themselves, rather than controlled by external factors) is related to health-related QOL (HR-QOL) after TBI 189 . Indeed, an externally oriented locus of control has been shown to be negatively related to HR-QOL. Locus of control, self-efficacy and coping are intertwined concepts that might serve as potential targets to improve HR-QOL. 12 months after mild TBI, symptoms and QOL are usually similar to that of healthy individuals 190 . However, in some individuals, a loss of life roles might hamper improvements in QOL or might even cause a further decline of life satisfaction. In individuals with PCS and persistent symptoms, headaches, especially migraines, have a negative effect on QOL and might respond to medication 191 . Depression is also common following mild TBI complicated by lesions seen on brain imaging, and is around eightfold higher than expected in the general population following TBI 192 and can be treated by a combination of medication and behavioural approaches. Instructions for good sleep hygiene are recommended because sleep disturbance is a frequent sequela of mild TBI 178 . As the consequences of TBI can vary between individuals, insight into the effects of TBI experienced by patients is required. In addition, individuals with serious disabilities might report high satisfaction with life, whereas caregivers and clinicians might question their QOL. A lack of awareness, but also a re-evaluation of what matters in life, by the patient might explain such a different perspective."}, {"section_title": "Outlook", "text": "Despite considerable advances, research on mild TBI, PCS and CTE is still in its early stages, with many gaps in our knowledge still to be filled (FIG. 6) . These gaps include improved knowledge of biophysical mechanisms of injury, the prevalence of CTE in contact sports athletes, as well as the precise molecular pathway from acute axonal injury to chronic and progressive neurodegeneration."}, {"section_title": "Mechanistic questions", "text": "Which forces cause brain damage in TBIs and trigger CTE? Axonal injury is probably the central mechanism in TBIs, which is accompanied by other changes, such as inflammation, metabolic crisis and oxidative stress. However, further research is needed to resolve why axons are differentially vulnerable to trauma compared with other brain structures and whether injured axons with axonal transport failure can be restored to normal. In addition, the relationship between the extent of axonal injury and recovery rate, or the development of PCS, after a single mild TBI is not known. Similarly, little is known about the number of mild TBIs or subconcussive head impacts that are needed to initiate the neurodegeneration that underlies CTE. In addition, whether blast-related TBI and CTE in military personnel is due to brain damage caused by the blast wave that progresses from the source of the explosion as a sphere of compressed and expanding gases creating high barometric pressure or whether the high velocity blast wind that follows gives a detrimental acceleration of the head with resulting axonal shearing is unknown 19 . Tools to quantify both the trauma force and the neuronal damage in mild TBI and blast injuries are required to resolve these questions.\nWhat governs recovery after acute concussion? Why a proportion of patients develop long-lasting PCS is unclear 193 . These patients might have more-severe neuro nal damage or sustain damage related to the type of impact and localization of injury, but the possible influences of psychogenic or psychosocial mechanisms remain to be examined."}, {"section_title": "What is the risk for CTE among contact sports athletes?", "text": "Although repetitive subconcussive head impacts are thought to initiate the neurodegenerative process that leads to CTE 47 , the number of known CTE cases is limited and the percentage of individuals participating in contact sports who will develop CTE is unknown. Thus, longitudinal epidemiological studies in contact sports athletes are needed to learn the frequency of CTE, as well as its relation to the number and severity of concussions, length of career and similar risk factors. Furthermore, examining which factors govern resiliency to CTE and resolving the possible influence on CTE risk of psychosocial factors, such as alcohol and drug abuse, and other health factors, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus and hypertension, are important.\nWhat is the role of CTE pathology and does it propagate in the brain? Preclinical discoveries suggest that repetitive concussive and/or subconcussive brain injuries initiate tau pathology that spreads to adjacent neurons in the absence of ongoing triggering factors 194 . However, we do not know if the tau aggregates after TBI have a causal role in delayed neurodegeneration and the development of CTE, or if they are a marker of prior injury. Indeed, one neuropathology study on blast TBI in military veterans has reported axonal damage, but no tau pathology, even in patients who survive long (up to 4 years) after the blast 195 . Another study has reported distinct astrocyte scarring with dense astrogliosis in several brain areas, but no or minimal tau pathology 196 . Further studies, especially longitudinal biomarker (tau PET and CSF tau) and neuropathology studies that correlate different types of pathology in affected brain regions with disease stage in CTE, are needed to determine whether tau pathology is the cause or a bystander of neuronal dysfunction in CTE. In addition, these studies will reveal whether progression of CTE is due to the spreading of tau pathology throughout neuronal networks or whether the disease simply affects an increasing number of brain regions with increasing severity (FIG. 6) ."}, {"section_title": "What is the role of A\u03b2 plaques in CTE?", "text": "The involvement of brain A\u03b2 mis-metabolism and aggregation after TBIs is supported by animal studies that have shown sequential accumulation of APP, upregulation of secretases and A\u03b2 generation with the formation of diffuse A\u03b2 plaques after rotational TBIs 68, 197 . How TBIs induce A\u03b2 oligomerization and aggregation, whether A\u03b2 oligomers cause toxicity after TBI and whether A\u03b2 plaques and intra-axonal depositions have causal roles in the increased risk of Alzheimer disease are unclear. CSF measurements and amyloid PET can monitor APP and A\u03b2 metabolism and aggregation in patients, and will help to resolve whether A\u03b2 aggregation is involved in CTE pathogenesis or whether it is a bystander of neuronal damage and degeneration.\nCan we find an objective measure for neuronal damage in mild TBI? Some argue that the term 'concussion' should no longer be used owing to its vague definition and variable symptoms without any clinically identifiable pathological substrate 198 . Accordingly, an unmet need exists for the development of biomarkers to identify and monitor axonal damage and other pathophysio logical processes in mild TBI. However, the most studied blood biomarker, the astroglial protein S100B, has poor specificity to predict intracranial pathology that can be observed with CT, with many false-positive results 199 . In addition, S100B is present in peripheral organs and non-neuronal cell types, for example, adipose tissue and chondrocytes 200 , making it responsive to peripheral injur ies and multiple traumas, further limiting its clinical usefulness for TBIs. Given that the central mechanism in TBIs is axonal damage, fluid biomarkers of axonal damage, such as tau 158, 162 and NF-L 159, 163 in blood samples, have been developed for TBIs, but need further clinical evaluation.\nCan we find tools to identify CTE in the clinic? Symptoms associated with CTE pathology, and its suggested clinical counterpart TES, might be difficult to differentiate not only from Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease but also from PCS and depression in younger patients 201 , so diagnostic tools are highly desirable. For Alzheimer disease, numerous biomarkers are available, including A\u03b2 PET and measurements of the levels of A\u03b242 in the CSF 202 , as well as the levels of T-tau, P-tau and NF-L in the CSF 135 . In addition, recent developments have resulted in promising ligands for tau PET imaging 203 . These Alzheimer disease biomarkers are also candidate CTE markers, but no clinical biomarker studies on patients with suspected CTE pathology have been conducted."}, {"section_title": "Prevention", "text": "Guidelines for return to play have been proposed by the American Academy of Neurology 204 . These state that an athlete with concussion should not return to play if they have persistent post-concussion symptoms at rest or with exertion, reduced academic or sports performance, abnormal neurological examination, neuropsychological test findings, or CT and/or MRI findings that indicate increased risk of further concussion and/or delayed neuro logical deterioration 204 . Strict compliance with these guidelines by field and ringside physicians might reduce both short-term and long-term suffering for contact sports athletes.\nFollowing international consensus criteria on concussion in sports, an athlete diagnosed with concussion should not be allowed to return to play on the day of injury by the physician or other licensed health provider 4 . Owing to the nature of the sport, this is not easily applied in boxing, in which an alternative to secure the well-being of the athletes might be to introduce rules that forbid blows to the head. In addition, the Word Medical Association recommended the general ban of boxing in 2005 (REF. 205 ), based on the risk for brain damage and that the basic intent of boxing is to knock the opponent unconscious. However, the liability lies with sports organiza tions and governments to regulate rules in a way that minimizes the risk for chronic brain damage for athletes, especially for those who are underaged (<16-18 years)."}, {"section_title": "Emerging treatments", "text": "Factors such as the marked heterogeneity of disease (including anatomical, physiological and genetic factors) across injury severity and the limitations of current outcome assessment tools have hindered the development of new therapies for TBIs 206 . Furthermore, successful translation of new therapies has been problematic despite the implementation of carefully designed multicentre, randomized controlled trials [207] [208] [209] . Accordingly, new clinical trial designs, such as comparative effectiveness trials, might help to define optimal care and facili tate successful randomized controlled trials 210 . Despite these challenges, several new therapies merit discussion.\nCerebral oedema with resultant intracranial hypertension is a key therapeutic target for severe TBI, but might also have a role across the injury spectrum 211 . The treatment of severe brain oedema involves CSF drainage, administration of osmolar agents and/or craniectomy. Now, molecularly guided approaches can be used to prevent the development of brain oedema rather than react to it after it is formed. Emerging treatments, such as glibenclamide, which targets sulfonylurea receptor 1-mediated ion channel opening, are in phase II clinical trials (NCT01454154) 212 . Similarly, inhibition of aquaporin 4-mediated oedema either directly or by blocking a cascade of events that are triggered by the release of high-mobility group protein B1 and the activation of Toll-like receptors, which upregulate aquaporin 4, is in preclinical testing 213 . Such approaches might improve care.\nSeveral approaches for the treatment of mild TBI are under investigation. For example, recent preclinical studies suggest that hyperthermia (\u226539 \u00b0C) at the time of injury might magnify secondary tissue damage and initiate degenerative processes, such as CTE; rapid normalization of body temperature might be neuroprotective 214 . Treatment of hyperthermia immediately after the time of injury (such as during football training camp in summer months) merits further investigation. This approach differs from the use of hypothermia given that it only entails return to normothermia. In addition, the acute accumulation and spread of a toxic cis P-tau protein isomer might disrupt axonal microtubule networks and lead to apoptosis, whereas treatment with a monoclonal antibody against cis P-tau might prevent its spread and improve outcome 215 . Finally, cellular therapies might improve outcome by either promoting new neuronal circuits or expressing trophic factors that are neuroprotective or pro-regenerative. A phase I study of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells in children with severe TBI suggested that this approach might be feasible, safe and associated with reduced treatment intensity to maintain intracranial pressure 216 ."}, {"section_title": "Fostering clinical research on TBIs and CTE", "text": "To improve our understanding of TBIs and CTE pathogenesis, large longitudinal clinical studies that combine clinical evaluations with imaging, biomarker and genetic data are necessary. The Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has had a vast impact on the understanding of Alzheimer disease 217 . For acute TBIs, the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) study in the United States (NCT02119182) and the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) study in Europe (NCT02210221) are two prospective observational studies examining clinical, imaging, genetic and blood biomarkers with longitudinal clinical follow-up across the TBI severity spectrum (including mild TBI). The goals of these studies are to improve methods for diagnosis and prognosis, refine outcome assessment and TBI care. For CTE, the Understanding Neurologic Injury and Traumatic Encephalopathy (UNITE) study 218 is a retrospective clinical-pathological study aiming to investigate the validity of recently proposed clinical criteria of CTE 99 and to identify clinical features that improve prediction of CTE pathology. The Diagnose CTE Research Project is a multi centre, prospective longitudinal study evaluating clinical criteria for the diagnosis of TES and fluid and imaging biomarkers for CTE, aiming to enable the diagnosis of CTE ante-mortem. These and other clinical studies are likely to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology, the ability to clinically diagnose and institute personalized therapy programmes for these disorders."}]
