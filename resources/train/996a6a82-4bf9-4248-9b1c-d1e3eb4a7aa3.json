INTRODUCTION", "text": "The development of medical imaging technology has seen increasing numbers of tools to portray medical images. Radiomics is a quantitative method to extract medical features that can extend to details that are invisible to human eyes. Radiomics features have been suggested for use as imaging biomarkers in tumor classifications for their advantages of higher sensitivity and specificity, such as in brain glioma and lung cancer [1] - [4] .\nStructural imaging markers have been taken as a robust measure for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and convergence evidence indicates that atrophy of the hippocampus may be an indicator for its early detection. Several studies have highlighted the possibility that hippocampal texture may serve as a prognostic neuroimaging biomarker of early cognitive impairment [5] - [8] .

For this purpose, four datasets having T1-weighted MRI scans for different scanning times including 15 subjects who were scanned three times, 19 subjects who were scanned two times, 23 subjects who were scanned four times and 3 subjects who were scanned forty times were adopted firstly, and then the bilateral hippocampus was segmented automatically based on multi-atlas methods. Secondly, radiomics features including intensity features, shape features, textural features, and the wavelet transformed features were extracted for the bilateral hippocampus. After that, the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and overall concordance correlation coefficient (OCCC) were calculated as measures of test-retest reliability ( Figure 1) .\nOur results show that most radiomics features are robust and reproducible, which indicates that these measures can serve as an MRI biomarker of AD.

HIPPOCAMPAL SEGMENTATION AND FEATURE EXTRACTION", "text": "The bilateral hippocampus regions were segmented with the local label learning (LLL) method [15] . For the present study, the radiomics features were computed using a previous method that had been successfully used in tumor analysis and to obtain the radiomics features of the hippocampus in AD. Detailed descriptions of each feature can be found in previous studies [1] , [7] . Briefly, the shape feature (n = 8) describes the shape information within the images, the intensity feature (n = 14) describes the statistics of the voxel intensity-value histogram within the images, and the textural feature represents similar or dissimilar inter-relationships between voxel values (n = 33). The wavelet transformation (with Symlet wavelet filter, ''sym4'' used in the present study) in eight directions (LLL, LLH, LHL, LHH, HLL, HLH, HHL, HHH) was used to combine the spatial and frequency information based on 14 intensity features and 33 textural features. The extraction tools adopted an in-house MATLAB script (https://github.com/YongLiulab/MCADI)."}, {"section_title": "E. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS", "text": "The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) was calculated for the intraindividual and intra-observer variation. ICC is a widely used reliability index in test-retest, intrarater, and interrater reliability analyses [16] , [17] . The overall concordance correlation coefficient is in terms of the interobserver variability for assessing agreement among multiple fixed observers [18] . The ICC and OCCC were used to quantify the test-retest reliability of radiomics features.\nThe ICC was used to evaluate the assessment of consistency or reproducibility in different observers when measuring the same feature. Specifically, ICC (1,1) was used to assess the intra-observer repeatability of radiomics features, ICC (3,1) was used to assess the inter-observer repeatability of radiomics features, and these forms are more in line with our data model. We calculated ICC (1,1) and ICC (3,1) as follows:\nwhere BMS is the between-subjects mean square, WMS is the within-subject mean square, and \u03ba is the number of sessions. The ICC has a value between 0 and 1, where ICC = 0 means no reliability and ICC = 1 means absolute reliability. The overall concordance correlation coefficient (OCCC) measures the agreement from two approaches [18] . The OCCC assesses agreement among multiple observers and is calculated as follows:\nwhere \u00b5 is the mean of all the variables, \u03c3 is the corresponding variance, both k and j are the observers, and J represents the total number of the observers. The OCCC ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 representing absolute disagreement and 1 showing absolute agreement between the test and retest results.\nThe OCCC metric was computed using the epiR package (https://rdrr.io/cran/epiR/src/R/epi.occc.R). The intra-observer ICC, inter-observer ICC and the OCCC value were divided into 4 intervals, [0,0.4) represents poor, [0.4,0.6) represents fair, [0.6,0.75) represents good, and the [0.75,1) represents almost excellent. The detailed interval information is shown in Table 1 .\nThe absolute gray value might be one of the main influences on the value of the repeatability result. To remove the influence of external factors, the gray value of the brain image was normalized in two ways: min-max normalization [19] and z-score normalization [ 19] . The min-max normalization was determined by\nwhere y i was regarded as the normalized gray value and x i was the gray value in the brain image. The z-score normalization used the following equation:\nwhere x i and y i are defined above,x was the mean value of the gray value of the brain image, and s was the standard value of the gray values."}, {"section_title": "III.

DISCUSSION", "text": "We have assessed the test-retest reliability of the radiomics features of the bilateral hippocampus. The results showed that most of these features achieved high test-retest (ICC and OCCC) scores. We believe that this is the first study to evaluate the test-retest reliability of this important brain region.\nRadiomics was proved to be an objective measure for providing quantitative information from medical images. Standardization and generalization are still major challenges for potential clinical translation in radiomics [1] , [4] . Previous studies on the repeatability of radiomics features were focused on the treatment of non-small-cell cancer and oropharyngeal cancer, and found that the shape feature was highly repeatable in CT [20] and PET [10] , [21] , but there is no consistent conclusion about the repeatability of texture features. In this study, we found that the shape feature has the highest repeatability, followed by the textural and intensity features. The repeatability of the shape feature was only influenced by the segmentation method, and it cannot reflect the distribution of gray values, but more information of medical images was reflected by the distribution of gray values. The textural and intensity features can well reflect the distribution of gray values. Therefore, the textural feature might be the most repeatable radiomic feature and a best repeatable biomarker in radiomics features. After min-max and z-score normalization, it can be observed that the repeatability of the shape and textural feature has not changed, but the repeatability of the intensity feature is significantly reduced after min-max normalization and is improved after z-score normalization. This may be caused by the change in the distribution of gray values of those kinds of transformations. Therefore, we must be careful in selecting the normalization method in future studies. In the wavelet transformation result, it can be observed that the LLL band can obtain the most repeatable radiomic feature numbers, perhaps because the LLL band catches the lower frequency signals.\nThe hippocampus is a crucial substructure in the brain, and it is meaningful to use the radiomics features in the hippocampus to conduct early classification of AD [5] - [7] , [22] - [24] . The study provides evidence that the textural feature is the most repeatable and is a potential biomarker for this kind of disease.\nAlthough we have achieved relatively stable results, there are still some limitations in the segmentation phase of the hippocampus and the sample type. The segmentation method is based on multi-maps, which might cause some flaws in the segmentation process. The sample type is relatively unitary, which might limit the robustness and power of the results. In future work, we hope to validate our results using the deep-learning segmentation method [25] some commonly used pipelines, such as Freesurfer and FSL, and we will investigate more types of datasets to verify the results."}, {"section_title": "V. CONCLUSION", "text": "In conclusion, by observing the repeatability of the radiomics features, the present study demonstrated three aspects:\n(1) The textural features are the most repeatable, and that texture features are a possible neuroimaging biomarker for clinical studies.\n(2) The repeatability of the intensity feature may be influenced by the distribution of gray values and we need to be careful in selection of normalization method in future studies.\n(3) The LLL band in the wavelet transformation can get the most repeatable radiomics features numbers and this transformation should be used more frequently in getting the wavelet transformed features.
