[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract Multimodal classification methods using different modalities of imaging and non-imaging data have recently shown great advantages over traditional single-modalitybased ones for diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as its prodromal stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, to the best of our knowledge, most existing methods focus on mining the relationship across multiple modalities of the same subjects, while ignoring the potentially useful relationship across different subjects. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a novel learning method for multimodal classification of AD/MCI, by fully exploring the relationships across both modalities and subjects. Specifically, our proposed method includes two subsequent components, i.e., label-aligned multi-task feature selection and multimodal classification. In the first step, the feature selection learning from multiple modalities are treated as different learning tasks and a group sparsity regularizer is imposed to jointly select a subset of relevant features.\nFurthermore, to utilize the discriminative information among labeled subjects, a new label-aligned regularization term is added into the objective function of standard multi-task feature selection, where label-alignment means that all multimodality subjects with the same class labels should be closer in the new feature-reduced space. In the second step, a multikernel support vector machine (SVM) is adopted to fuse the selected features from multi-modality data for final classification. To validate our method, we perform experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database using baseline MRI and FDG-PET imaging data. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves better classification performance compared with several state-of-the-art methods for multimodal classification of AD/MCI."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a physical disease that affects the brain and is the most common cause of dementia. There were more than 26.6 million people worldwide with AD in 2010, and it is predicted that 1 in 85 people will be affected by 2050 (Brookmeyer et al. 2007 ). So far, there is no treatment for the disease, which worsens as it progresses, and eventually leads to death. Thus, it is very important to accurately identify AD, especially for its early stage also known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) which has a high risk of progressing to AD (Petersen et al. 1999) .\nExisting studies have shown that AD is related to the structural atrophy, pathological amyloid depositions, and metabolic alterations in the brain (Jack et al. 2010; Nestor et al. 2004) . So far, multiple biomarkers have been shown to be sensitive to the diagnosis of AD and MCI, i.e., structural MR imaging (MRI) for brain atrophy measurement (Leon et al. 2007; Du et al. 2007; Fjell et al. 2010; Mcevoy et al. 2009 ), functional imaging (e.g., FDG-PET) for hypometabolism quantification (De et al. 2001; Morris et al. 2001) , and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for quantification of specific proteins (Bouwman et al. 2007; Mattsson et al. 2009; Shaw et al. 2009; Fjell et al. 2010) .\nIn recent years, machine learning and pattern classification methods, which can learn a model from training subjects to predict class label (i.e., patient or normal control) on unseen subject, have been widely applied to studies of AD and MCI based on single modality of biomarkers. For example, researchers have extracted the features from the structural MRI, such as voxel-wise tissue (Desikan et al. 2009; Fan et al. 2007; Magnin et al. 2009 ), cortical thickness (Desikan et al. 2009; Oliveira et al. 2010 ) and hippocampal volumes (Gerardin et al. 2009; MJ et al. 2004 ) for AD and MCI classification. Besides structural MRI, some researchers also used fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) (Ch\u00e9telat et al. 2003; Foster et al. 2007; Higdon et al. 2004) for AD or MCI classification.\nDifferent imaging modalities provide different views of brain structure or function. For example, structural MRI reveals patterns of gray matter atrophy, while FDG-PET measures the reduced glucose metabolism in the brain. It is reported that MRI and FDG-PET provide different sensitivity for memory prediction between disease and health . Using multiple biomarkers may reveal hidden information that could be overlooked by using single modality. Researchers have begun to integrate multiple modalities to further improve the accuracy of disease classification (Leon et al. 2007; Fjell et al. 2010; Foster et al. 2007; Walhovd et al. 2010; Apostolova et al. 2010; Dai et al. 2012; Gray et al. 2012; Hinrichs et al. 2011; Huang et al. 2011; Landau et al. 2010; Westman et al. 2012; Yuan et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2011 ). For instance, Hinrichs et al. (2011) used two modalities (including MRI and FDG-PET) for AD classification. Zhang et al. (2011) combined MRI, FDG-PET and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for classifying patients with AD/MCI from normal controls. Dai et al. (2012) integrated structural MRI (sMRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) for AD classification. Gray et al. (2012) used MRI, FDG-PET, CSF and categorical genetic information for AD/MCI classification.\nAlthough promising results were achieved by existing multimodal classification methods, the problem of small number of subjects and large feature dimensions limits further performance improvement of the above methods. For neuroimaging data, even after feature extraction, the dimension of feature is still relatively high compared to the size of subject. Also, there may exist redundant or irrelevant features for subsequent classification task.\nThus, those irrelevant and redundant features need to be removed for reducing feature dimension by feature selection. In the literature, most existing feature selection methods are often performed for each modality individually, which ignores the potential relationship among different modalities. To the best of our knowledge, only a few studies focus on jointly selecting features from multimodality neuroimaging data for AD/MCI classification. For example, Huang et al. (2011) proposed a sparse composite linear discriminant analysis model (SCLDA) for identification of disease-related brain regions of early AD from multi-modality data. Zhang and Shen (2012) proposed a multi-modal multi-task learning for joint feature selection for AD classification and regression. Liu et al. (2014) proposed inter-modality relationship constrained multi-task feature selection for AD/MCI classification. Jie et al. (2015) presented a manifold regularized multi-task feature selection method for multimodal classification of AD/MCI. However, except for Jie et al.'s work, most of the existing multi-modality feature selection methods focus on using multi-modality information from the same subjects, while ignoring the intrinsic relationship across different subjects, which may also contain useful information for further improving the classification performance. Different from Jie et al.'s method, the proposed approach not only considers the information of each modality, but also regards the relationship across different modalities as extra information. Hence, Jie et al.'s method can be regarded as a special case of our proposed method.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel learning method that can fully explore the relationships across both modalities and subjects through mining and fusing discriminative features from multi-modality data for AD/MCI classification. Specifically, our proposed learning method includes two major steps: 1) label-aligned multi-task feature selection, and 2) multimodal classification. First, we treat the feature selections from multi-modality data as different learning tasks and adopt a group sparsity regularizer to ensure a subset of relevant features to be jointly selected from multi-modality data. Moreover, to utilize the discriminative information among labeled subjects, we introduce a new label-aligned regularization term into the objective function of standard multi-task feature selection. Here, label-alignment means that all multi-modality subjects with the same class label should be closer in the new feature-reduced space. Then, we use a multi-kernel support vector machine (SVM) to fuse the selected features from multi-modality data for final classification. The proposed method has been evaluated on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, demonstrating better results compared to several state-of-theart multi-modality-based methods."}, {"section_title": "Method Neuroimaging data", "text": "We use the data obtained from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (www.loni.usc. edu) in this paper. The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), private pharmaceutical companies and non-profit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-year public-private partnership. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit approximately 200 cognitively normal older individuals to be followed for 3 years, 400 MCI patients to be followed for 3 years, and 200 early AD patients to be followed for 2 years.\nWe use imaging data from 202 ADNI participants with corresponding baseline MRI and FDG-PET data. In particular, it includes 51 AD patients, 99 MCI patients and 52 normal controls (NC). The MCI patients were divided into 43 MCI converters (MCI-C) who have progressed to AD with 18 months and 56 MCI non-converters (MCI-NC) whose diagnoses have still remain stable within 18 months. Table 1 lists the clinical and demographic information for the study population. A detailed description on acquiring MRI and PET from ADNI as used in this paper can be found in (Zhang et al. 2011) . All structural MR scans were acquired from 1.5 T scanners. Raw Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) MRI scans were downloaded from the public ADNI site (adni.loni.usc.edu), reviewed for quality, and automatically corrected for spatial distortion caused by gradient nonlinearity and B1 field inhomogeneity. PET images were acquired 30-60 min post-injection, averaged, spatially aligned, interpolated to a standard voxel size, intensity normalized, and smoothed to a common resolution of 8 mm full width at half maximum.\nImage pre-processing and feature extraction are performed for all MR and PET images by following the same procedures as in (Zhang et al. 2011) . First, we do anterior commissure (AC)-posterior commissure (PC) correction on all images, and use the N3 algorithm (Sled et al. 1997) to correct the intensity inhomogeneity. Next, we do skull-stripping on structural MR images using both brain surface extractor (BSE) (Shattuck et al. 2001 ) and brain extraction tool (BET) (Smith and Stephen 2002) , followed by manual edition and intensity inhomogeneity correction. After removal of cerebellum, FAST in the FSL package (Zhang et al. 2001 ) is used to segment structural MR images into three different tissues: gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). After registration using HAMMER (Shen and Davatzikos 2002) , we obtain the subject-labeled image based on a template with 93 manual labels. Then, we compute the GM tissue volume of each region as a feature. For PET image, we first align it to its respective MR image of the same subject using a rigid transformation, and then compute the average intensity of each ROI in the PET image as a feature. Therefore, for each subject, we totally obtain 93 features from MR image and another 93 features from PET image."}, {"section_title": "Label-aligned multi-task feature learning", "text": "In this section, we will first briefly introduce the conventional multi-task feature selection (Evgeniou and Pontil 2004; Kumar and Daume Iii 2012; Obozinski et al. 2006 Obozinski et al. , 2010 Yuan and Lin 2006) , and then derive our proposed labelaligned multi-task feature selection model, as well as the corresponding optimization algorithm.

Let\nT \u2208\u211d N be the label vector corresponding to N training samples, where the value of y i is +1 or \u22121 (i.e., patient or normal control). Then, the objective function of multi-task feature selection (MTFS) model is as follows (Yuan and Lin 2006) :\nwhere w m \u2208\u211d d is the regression coefficient vector for the m -th modality and the coefficient vectors for all M modalities form \nand M is the total number of modalities. In (1), W k k 2;1 is the \u2113 2,1 -norm of matrix W defined as \u2016W\u2016 2,1 =\u2211 i = 1 d \u2016w j \u2016 2 , where w j is the j -th row of matrix W. Here, \u03bb 1 is a regularization parameter controlling the relative contributions of the two terms.\nThe \u2113 2;1 -norm W k k 2;1 can be seen as the sum of the \u2113 2 -norms of the rows of matrix W (Yuan and Lin 2006) , which encourages the weights corresponding to the same feature across different modalities to be grouped together and then a small number of common features will be jointly selected. So, the solution of MTFS results in a weight matrix W whose elements in many rows are all zeros for the characteristic of 'group sparsity'. It is worth noting that when there is only one modality (i.e., M =1), the MTFS model will degenerate into the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model (Tibshirani 1994) ."}, {"section_title": "Label-aligned multi-task feature selection", "text": "One limitation of the standard multi-task feature selection model is that only the relationship between modalities of the same subjects is considered, while ignoring the important relationship among labeled subjects. To address this issue, we introduce a new term called label-aligned regularization term, which minimizes the distance between within-class subjects in the feature-reduced space as follows:\nwhere, S i j is defined as: \nThe regularization term (2) can be explained as follows.\nS ij measures the distance between x i p and x j q in the projected space. It implies that if x i p and x j q are from the same class, the distance between them should be as small as possible in the projected space. It is worth noting that 1) when p \u00bc q the local geometric structure of the same modality data is preserved in the feature-reduced space; 2) when p < q the complementary information provided from different modalities are used to guide the estimation of the feature-reduced space. Therefore, the Eq. (2) preserves the intrinsic label relatedness among multi-modality data and also explores the complementary information conveyed by different modalities. Generally speaking, the goal of (2) is to preserve label relatedness by aligning paired within-class subjects from multiple modalities.\nBy incorporating the regularizer (2) into (1), we can obtain the objective function of our label-aligned multi-task feature selection model as below:\nwhere \u03bb 1 and \u03bb 2 are the two positive constants that control the sparseness and the degree of preserving the distance between subjects, respectively. From (4), we can not only jointly select a subset of common features from multimodality data, but also preserve label relatedness by aligning paired within-class subjects. Figure 2 illustrates the used relationships among modalities and subjects in our proposed model as compared with the traditional multi-modality methods. In Fig. 2a , traditional multimodal methods only concern the relationships of different modalities (i.e., the single line connecting MRI and PET) from the same subject. As we can see from Fig. 2b , our proposed method can preserve not only the multi-modality relationship from the same subject, but also the correlation across modalities between different subjects.

"}, {"section_title": "Multi-task learning", "text": "Multi-task learning is a recently developed technique in machine learning field, which can jointly learn multiple tasks via a shared representation. Because the domain information or some commonality is contained in the learning tasks, multitask learning can usually improve the performances by learning classifiers for multiple tasks together. Recently, multi-task learning has been introduced into medical imaging field. For example, Zhang et al. (Zhang and Shen 2012) applied multi-task learning for joint prediction of both regression variables (i.e., clinical scores) and classification variable (i.e., class labels) in Alzheimer's disease. In their method, multi-task feature selection was first used to select the common subset features corresponding to different tasks, and then multi-kernel SVM was performed for final regression and classification. It is worth noting that the feature selection step in (Zhang and Shen 2012) was performed separately for each modality, while ignoring the potential relationship among different modalities. Afterwards, Liu et al. (2014) considered the inter-modality relationship within each subject to preserve the complementary information among modalities. However, in their method only information corresponding to individual subject is concerned. Suk et al. (2014) first assumed the data classes were multipeak distribution, and then formulated a multi-task learning problem in a l-2,1 framework with new label encodings obtained by clustering. However, the method in (Suk et al. 2014) still did not consider the potential information across different modalities. More recently, Jie et al. (2015) proposed a manifold regularized multi-task feature learning method, which only considered the manifold information in each modality separately and thus cannot reflect the information across different modalities. It is worth noting that our proposed method and Jie et al.'s method are developed based on different considerations. Jie et al.'s method only concerns preserving the manifolds existing in each modality of the data. Different from Jie et al.'s method, the proposed approach not only takes the structure information of each modality into account, but also regards the relationship across different modalities as extra information. Hence, Jie et al.'s method can be regarded as a special case of our proposed method. Although our proposed method has a more general feature selection framework compared with Jie et al.'s approach, the objective function of our method is still convex. Thus, the optimal solution can still be obtained, i.e., by using Accelerated Proximal Gradient (APG) method.\nIn contrast, our proposed label-aligned multi-task feature learning method can preserve the relationships not only across different modalities in the same subjects but also among different modalities in different subjects.

Although multi-class classification is more challenging than binary-class classification, it is very important to diagnose different stage of dementia. Second, the proposed method requires the same number of features from different modalities. Other modalities in ADNI database, such as CSF and genetic data, which have different feature numbers, may also carry important pathological information that can help further improve the classification performance.
