[4] [5] [6] [7] Additionally, the long-term safety of these treatments remains to be determined. Clearly, there is a great need for more specific and efficacious therapies for AD.\nConverging evidence from neuropathological and in vivo imaging studies has demonstrated the vulnerability of the hippocampus and heteromodal association cortices in AD, as well as decreased functional connectivity in cortico-cortical and cortico-hippocampal circuits. 8, 9 Approaching AD as a dysfunction in cortico-cortical and cortico-hippocampal circuits suggests that modulating neuronal activity within these networks may be a viable treatment option for early AD. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical technique that has shown success modulating pain, 10 motor dysfunction, 11, 12 and mood 13, 14 circuits in conditions for which pharmacologic treatments are not effective. The importance of developing circuitry-based therapeutic approaches to modulate cortical and hippocampal networks affected in AD was the impetus for a Phase I study of DBS of the fornix in early AD patients. 15 The fornix is a white matter bundle that connects the hippocampus with other components of the limbic system, 16, 17 forming circuits that have been implicated in episodic memory. 18, 19 Recent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have shown white matter reductions in the fornix of individuals with AD. 20 In fact, fornix atrophy may precede both hippocampal degeneration and clinical symptoms of AD and predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. 21, 22 This growing body of evidence, combined with rodent studies showing that DBS of the Papez circuit improves memory and promotes neurogenesis, 23, 24 indicates that DBS targeting of the fornix region (DBS-f) may be an effective treatment for AD symptoms. In the open-label Phase I trial of six AD subjects treated with DBS-f for 12 months, positron emission tomography (PET) scans showed an increase in cortical glucose metabolism and increased cortical functional connectivity over 1 year 15 in contrast to the decreases in cortical metabolism and functional connectivity typically observed in AD. [25] [26] [27] Building on the aforementioned collective observations, ADvance was designed as a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial to preliminarily assess the safety and efficacy of DBS-f for the treatment of very mild AD, as well as the utility of prespecified clinical and neuroimaging baseline measures as predictors of response. While other targets along the Papez circuit could, at least in theory, be suitable or perhaps more optimal, we chose a target within the hypothalamus which contains both the descending portion of the fornix and the mammillary body. This was done based on our empirical observation of acute memory effects in a patient with hypothalamic stimulation for obesity 28 and the preliminary observations in the six AD patients in the pilot study of DBS for AD. 15 Other potential targets would require validation of both safety and efficacy, something that was beyond the scope of our trial.

Interestingly, patients with less severe prestimulation cognitive dysfunction and less severe metabolic deficits were more likely to benefit from DBS-f in this trial. 15 This study provided the basis for the inclusion criteria used in ADvance, which focus on selection of participants with very mild AD. Implanted participants were younger, more likely to be male, and had lower baseline ADAS-cog-11 scores than the mean scores in recently reported Phase III trials of amyloid-lowering agents in AD. [64] [65] [66] Mean ADAS-cog-11 was 17.5 for implanted ADvance participants, and ranged from 19 to 23 in recent Phase III trials. Thus, our participants were younger and less impaired than those in these Phase III trials, but the differences were relatively small.\nFontaine et al 67 recruited 110 patients with Alzheimer dementia or MCI to be screened for a study assessing DBS for cognitive decline, and one subject met criteria, consented, and continued on to implantation. In the current study, 42 of 85 screened subjects consented and underwent implantation. One possible explanation for this difference may be that the Fontaine et al 67 study required subjects to have received a DSM-IV AD diagnosis within 2 years and have a mini-mental state examination score between 20 and 24, which was not required in the ADvance study. It also is possible that the 1-year open-label follow-up phase used in ADvance may have contributed to improved participation.

Although ADAS-cog scores worsened by an average of 3 points after 1 year of stimulation, the authors noted that this was less than the average 6-to 7-point worsening seen in prior reports of patients with AD. Further, global increases in metabolism in amygdalohippocampal and temporal regions were seen in three out of the four patients who underwent PET scans of cerebral glucose metabolism. 68 Taken in the context of prior research, ADvance is a novel, important step in studying DBS-f as a treatment for mild AD. The subject pool is much larger than prior studies and involves 1 year of double-blind, controlled cognitive testing and neuroimaging. The 1-year duration of the controlled comparison increases the likelihood of identifying significant differences between the stimulated (treatment arm) and nonstimulated (control arm) cohorts in this slowly progressive disorder. The 1-year blinded, controlled phase of the study is followed by up to 3 years of continued open-label follow-up with all patients being stimulated, which affords systematic pre-and postassessment of outcomes in about half the participants, and 2 years of additional follow-up. While the primary objective of the study is to evaluate safety, the larger subject population and controlled design affords preliminary testing of the efficacy of DBS-f in delaying cognitive decline and improving cortical glucose metabolism.\nThe ADvance methodology outlined here is strengthened by recruitment from seven sites with experienced investigators and rigorous subject selection by an independent ERC. The primary clinical outcome measures are standardized and validated and have been widely used so that the results of the current study can be evaluated in comparison to studies that tested other symptomatic treatments such as cholinesterase inhibitors. 69 The neuroimaging outcome measures, especially cerebral glucose metabolism, have also been well studied in AD 56, 57, 70, 71 and enable us to examine changes in brain function throughout the trial. Limitations of ADvance include limited sample size. Although larger than prior DBS studies, there are only 21 patients in each of the masked treatment groups. The goal is that the results of ADvance will inform a larger-scale clinical trial focused primarily on efficacy, rather than on safety, of DBS-f as a treatment for mild AD.\nResearch elucidating the neurobiological mechanism of DBS treatment for neurodegenerative diseases such as AD remains limited. While we hypothesize that this treatment works by stimulation of fornix-hippocampal-cortical circuits, and potentially even promotes neurogenesis in the hippocampus, this remains unproven. The memory circuits we are examining may be undergoing degeneration at varying rates in individual study participants, limiting the effectiveness of DBS-f to slow cognitive decline and our ability to examine the efficacy of DBS-f within our study population.\nIn summary, the ADvance trial was successful in enrolling appropriate patients for a novel application of DBS, and we believe several unique design aspects outlined here could be considered in future clinical trials of DBS targeting AD and other cognitive disorders."}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This research is supported by a grant from the National Institute on Aging, R01AG042165, and a vendor grant received from Functional Neuromodulation Ltd, the sponsor of the ADvance study.\nThe ADvance study team includes Todd Langevin, Lisa Fosdick, Kristen Drake, Donald E Reymers, Robyn Moxon, Dan O'Connell, Vince Owens, Cara Pendergrass, Susan Klees, Steven D Targum, and the seven participating clinical trial sites.\nChair's office at Johns Hopkins University and University of Toronto: Constantine G Lyketsos, MD, MHS, coprincipal investigator; Elizabeth Plank Althouse, professor and chair of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins Bayview; Andres M Lozano, MD, PhD, FRCSC, FACS, co-principal investigator, professor, and Chair of Neurosurgery, Tasker Chair of Functional Neurosurgery; Gwenn Smith, PhD, imaging core director, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, Johns Hopkins University; Cynthia Munro, PhD, neuropsychologist, associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, Johns Hopkins University; Esther Oh, MD, medical monitor, assistant professor of geriatric medicine, Johns Hopkins University; Jeannie Sheppard Leoutsakos, PhD, data core leader, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, Johns Hopkins University.
