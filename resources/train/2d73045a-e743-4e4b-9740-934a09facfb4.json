By linear extrapolation of estimates from 2006, the population worldwide who have AD will increase to over 100 million by 2050 [Thompson et al., 2003; Moradi et al., 2015] . In fact, researchers believe that early detection will be key to preventing, slowing and stopping Alzheimer's disease. Neuroimaging as a powerful tool for accurate identification and understanding informative feature is necessary for early Alzheimer's disease prognosis and diagnosis Nie et al., 2016] . Therefore, many machine learning methods have been proposed to study neuroimaging measures to detect pathology associated with AD and to predict cognitive scores [Wang et al., 2011b; Huo et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016] . Among them, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are one of the most extensively used imaging modality in tracking AD progression.\n: non-zero elements : zero elements Figure 1 : The sparse shrinkage patterns of matrix B imposed different structured sparsity-inducing norms: (a) l2,1-norm, (b) l2,1-norm + l1,1-norm, (c) l2,1-norm + l1,2-norm. Blue points represent the non-zero weights and white points represent the zero weights. In (b), the l1,1-norm suppresses the first feature selected by l2,1-norm. In (c), l1,2-norm will keep at least one non-zero weight for this feature, leading to the stable feature selection results.\nIn the association study of selecting effective longitudinal phenotypic markers to predict cognitive scores from imaging features, the input usually consists of two matrices: the imaging feature matrix X = [x 1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , x n ] \u2208 R d\u00d7n and the corresponding cognitive score matrix Y = [y 1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , y n ]\nT \u2208 R n\u00d7m , where n is the number of samples, d is the number of features and m is the number of different measures of a certain cognitive performance.\nA forthright method to identify informative imaging markers is to perform feature selection [Chang and Yang, 2016] , which has been demonstrated as a useful way to reflect the correlation between cognitive measures after removing the indistinctive neuroimaging markers. More recently, sparse regularization model has been extensively utilized to learn the structure of data and obtain effective feature in different applications. The sparsity-inducing norm based feature selection methods solve the convex optimization problems of the form: min\nwhere L is a convex function and \u2126 can include one or more non-smooth sparsity-inducing norms.\nWhen \u2126 is the l 1 -norm, the l 1 shrinkage methods such as LASSO identify informative longitudinal phenotypic markers in the brain that are related to pathological changes of AD by imposing flat sparsity [Liu et al., 2014] . However, the selected features distribute randomly among the whole brain that can not be well explained. In predicting cognitive scores task, we expect to select the most informative markers, which are important to all participants including AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and heathy control (HC). To address this issue, group LASSO with a l 2,1 -norm is used to impose the structured sparsity on parameter matrix for feature selection [Obozinski et al., 2010; Jie et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2017; . It enforces the important features to have non-zero weights cross all participants, however many important features often are only discriminant to partial classes, i.e. having large weights on these participants. Thus, such important features may be ignored by the above methods.\nOn this account, Lee et al. and Wang et al. proposed to add one more l 1,1 -norm regularization term to achieve both structured and flat sparsity [Lee et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011a] . However, because the l 1,1 -norm regularization term enforces the flat sparsity and is prone to shrink the non-large values to zeros, the non-zero weights of some important features may also be forced to be zeros, i.e. some features selected by the l 2,1 -norm regularization term can be totally suppressed by the l 1,1 -norm regularization term. As a result, many informative longitudinal phenotypic markers are neglected during the feature selection procedure. Thus, more properly designed structured sparsity-inducing norms are desired in feature selection research.\nIn this paper, we propose a robust low-rank structured sparse regression method (RLSR) to simultaneously select the important neuroimaging markers and learn the underlying structure between cognitive measures. Our main contributions are three-fold: (1) The new mixed structured sparsityinducing norms are introduced to overcome the above overshrinkage drawback in the existing sparse learning based feature selection models. (2) The explicit rank-k low-rank matrix fitting approach is used to extract the underlying interrelation structures between cognitive measures. (3) Because our method leads to a highly non-smooth objective, we derive an efficient algorithm to solve the new objective with proved convergence. We validate our method on cognitive data of the ADNI cohort and obtain promising results.\nNotations. We summarize the notations used in this paper. Matrices are written as uppercase letters and vectors are written as bold lowercase letters. For matrix W = {w ij }, its i-th row, j-th column are denoted as w i , w j respectively. The l p -norm of the vector v \u2208 R n is defined as\ni || 2 (in some related papers, people also used the notation l 1 /l 2 -norm). l 1,2 -norm of ma-"}, {"section_title": "Robust Low-Rank Structured Sparse Learning", "text": "The l 2,1 -norm based objectives select the informative imaging markers across all the cognitive scores with joint sparsity, i.e. each imaging marker has either small score or large score for all the cognitive measures. However, for accurate identification of effective imaging markers, we utilize participants including AD, MCI and HC during deferent period. Consequently, many features may be irrelevant to each other, which could deteriorate the feature selection performance if we consider all the imaging markers as one group to do feature selection. On the other hand, as we discussed in the introduction section, an extra l 1,1 -norm regularizer will suppress too many non-zero values and lead unstable feature selection results. For example, when we target to select top 20 features and adjust the trade-off parameter to let l 2,1 -norm makes about 20 features with relatively large weights, the added l 1,1 -norm will dramatically shrink the weights such that only few important features (much less than 20) can be selected. To tackle this over-shrinkage problem, we add a convex squared l 1,2 -norm regularizer instead of l 1,1 -norm and solve:\nThe typical loss functions are the least square loss and logistic loss. To improve the computational efficiency, we utilize the least square loss in this paper to select informative markers for ADNI data. Thus, our method can be applied to both classification tasks (e.g. AD/MCI versus Normal Controls (NC)) and regression tasks (e.g., estimation of clinical cognitive scores). We perform the latter in this paper.\nIn Eq. (2), we proposed the novel mixed structured sparsity norms. The standard l 2,1 -norm enforces the joint sparsity across all cognitive measures to select imaging markers. The new l 1,2 -norm uses l 2 -norm between markers, such that at least one non-zero element in the rows of B selected by l 2,1 -norm regularizer will be kept. Thus, we won't lose the discriminative imaging markers selected by the l 2,1 -norm regularization. At the same time, the l 1,2 -norm imposes the l 1 -norm between cognitive score weights of each marker to shrink the weight values of uncorrelated or irrelevant cognitive measures. For illustration purpose, in Fig. 1 , we plot the sparse shrinkage patterns of the matrix B using: (a) l 2,1 -norm regularizer only, (b) l 2,1 -norm and l 1,1 -norm regularizers, (c) l 2,1 -norm and l 1,2 -norm regularizers. The l 1,1 -norm overshrinks the weights and removes the first feature selected by l 2,1 -norm. The l 1,2 -norm suppress some weights with supporting the results of l 2,1 -norm, e.g. the first feature is still kept in the list.\nMore important, with regard to this specific task that predicting AD progression, we hope to extract and utilize the underlying interrelations between cognitive measures to enhance the accuracy of feature selection. In recent research [Ji and Ye, 2009; Deng et al., 2015] , the trace norm regularization has been used to seek the low-rank structured shared common representations:\nHowever, there are two deficiencies: 1) the optimal low-rank approximation is resulted by tediously tuning the parameter \u03bb, which has no direct connection to the rank value; 2) the feature selection isn't enforced in this model. To address the above problems, we consider the following low-rank regression:\nwhere m is the number of classes and d is the dimension of features. Compared to the parameter \u03bb in Eq. (3), the parameter s is more feasible to be decided by users. Moreover, in\nProceedings of the Twenty-Sixth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence order to select features and simultaneously keep the low-rank matrix fitting, we propose the following model,\nwhere W \u2208 R d\u00d7s , P \u2208 R s\u00d7m and s \u2264 min(m, d). The product B = W P is a low-rank matrix with rank(B) \u2264 s. Our new objective simultaneously learns the underlying interrelation between cognitive measures by low-rank matrix fitting and selects the informative neuroimaging markers by mixed structured sparsity-inducing norms. We also consider the real world data often have outliers and hence replace the least square loss by the l 2,1 -norm based loss function, which imposes the l 1 -norm between data points to reduce the effect of outliers. Our final objective is to solve:\nThe resulted objective has three non-smooth terms, such that the optimization becomes difficult. To solve our new objective, we will derive an efficient algorithm in next section with proved convergence."}, {"section_title": "Optimization", "text": "In this section, an efficient algorithm is proposed to tackle Eq.

We compared our method against three most related algorithms including multivariate ridge regression (RR), joint l 2,1 -norm minimization (l 2,1 ) on both loss function and regularization [Nie et al., 2010] , linear regression with trace norm. These comparing methods are all widely used in statistical learning and brain image analysis.\nIn all experiments, we automatically tune the regularization parameters by selecting among the values {10 r : r \u2208 {\u22125, ..., 5}} with standard 5-fold cross-validation strategy.After the algorithm converges, we sort the row index of matrix W by the summation of the absolute values in each row, and features are selected by the top ranked indices. To measure prediction performance, we compute the root mean square error (RMSE) between the predicted score and the ground truth.\nThe prediction experiment evaluated by ridge regression is repeated for 100 times and average results are reported in Fig. 2 . As shown in Fig. 2 , we can clearly see that the prediction results of our method consistently outperforms other competing methods in nearly all the test cases for all the cognitive tasks except some outlier part in Fig. 2f . But it doesn't really matter since the proposed method catches up soon. The reasons why the proposed method performs best go as follows: RR assumed the cognitive measures to be independent at different time point which neglects the correlations along the time. And for l 2,1 , since the pathological change of brain structures due to AD usually do not occur in the pre-identified regions with certain shapes, thus it is difficult to define meaningful feature groups. This makes l 2,1 perform worse. Trace norm is a good way to seek the underlying interrelations between cognitive scores, but it ignores the fact that the informative markers relate to AD among all the imaging measures only occupy a small part. As for the proposed method, we not only detect group structure within longitudinal phenotypic neuroimaging markers, but also capture the correlations among cognitive measures.
