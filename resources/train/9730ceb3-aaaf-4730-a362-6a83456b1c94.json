The ARMS is a comprehensive survey which gathers data on crops, input usage, farmer demographics, and finances, and is a very useful tool for researchers. The ARMS can also be used by those in government to determine the effectiveness of policy and regulation, and to assess effectiveness and funding levels of farm programs. One of the farm programs that uses information provided by ARMS is the USDA's Farm Service Agency's (FSA) Farm Loan Program. ARMS data may be used to determine the impact of FSA in meeting future farmer loan demand and funding levels needed to meet program demand."}, {"section_title": "Purpose of Study", "text": "Because the ARMS plays a critical role in research and policy, the accuracy of the ARMS data is also of fundamental importance. Many studies have stated the importance of the ARMS to researchers in academia and government who analyze U.S. farm and conservation policy as well as the effects of macroeconomic and other factors on the U.S. farm sector (Blank and Klinefelter, 2012;Featherstone, Park, and Weber, 2012;Weber and Clay, 2013). One of the ways that the ARMS data accuracy may be compromised is due to the respondents themselves. Farm operators may not want to truthfully answer debt questions or operators may not take the time to accurately respond to the debt questions. Nonresponse and inaccurate reporting in the ARMS can cause biased estimates that do not accurately reflect farm financial health or the effectiveness and demand of USDA credit programs. Since nonresponse and inaccurate reporting can cause significant bias in statistical analysis, research needs to be conducted to determine the magnitude of response error on the ARMS. The analysis in this study is undertaken using matched FSA and ARMS data. ARMS and FSA loan data were matched using the primary operator identifier (POID). The POID is the identifier used by USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) for the ARMS and is unique for farms within each State. USDA constructed a dataset of outstanding direct and guaranteed loans which included the POID. ARMS data were then matched to the FSA loan data by using the POID. Focus is on the identification of respondent errors when answering farm debt questions in the ARMS and on the magnitude of the errors. A multinomial logit model is estimated to identify demographic, structural, and financial characteristics of FSA borrowers who accurately and inaccurately classify their farm operations as having end of year debt on the ARMS. Additionally, the magnitude of response errors in ARMS for both FSA direct and guaranteed loan programs are estimated. Future researchers using ARMS data to appraise borrower debt status will be better informed about potential data limitations."}, {"section_title": "ARMS Overview", "text": "ARMS is an annual survey administered annually by the NASS, and is broken into three phases (USDA, ERS, 2015a). Phase I determines which operations are still in business. Phase II gathers information on production practices and input usage. Phase III assesses the finances of farm businesses and farm households. Of the three phases of the ARMS, the current study is interested in the Phase III survey which collects data on income, expenses, assets, liabilities, and operator demographics. Phase III tends to be long and complex in order to capture all the information needed to fully evaluate farm financial health and policy effects (Millar and O'Connor, 2012)."}, {"section_title": "FSA Overview", "text": "The USDA's FSA provides loans to farm operators who are unable to obtain credit from conventional sources at equitable rates and terms. The FSA loan program benefits beginning farmers, socially disadvantaged (SDA) farmers, and established farmers facing temporary financial setbacks. The FSA sets aside some funds specifically for beginning and SDA farmers. A beginning farmer is an operator who has operated a farm ten or less years, does not have a farm thirty percent or larger than the average farm in their county, meets all FSA loan eligibility criteria, and contributes significantly in the operation of the farm. SDA borrowers have to meet all the FSA loan program eligibility criteria, and belong to a group that has historically been underserved because of ethnicity, race, and/or gender. According to the FSA, these SDA groups are: \"American Indians or Alaskan Natives, Asians, Blacks or African-Americans, Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders, Hispanics and women\" (USDA, FSA, 2012). FSA provides two main loan programs to eligible borrowers: direct and guaranteed (USDA, FSA, 2015a). Under the direct loan program, FSA provides loans directly to the borrower. The direct loan program has a number of loan types, of which four are considered: farm ownership (FO), operating loan (OL), emergency loan (EM), and economic emergency (EE). FO loans may be used to make land purchases and farm improvements. OL loans may be used to purchase livestock and equipment, pay for operating and family living expenses, and refinance debt under certain circumstances. EM loans are to help producers who have had production and physical losses as the result of drought, flooding, other natural disasters or quarantine. Although EE loans have not been originated since the early 1980s, they were for 40 year terms with some still having unpaid balances at the time of analysis. Farmers who were unable to receive credit from their usual lender due to national or area-wide economic stresses, such as general tightening of agricultural credit or an unfavorable relationship between production costs and prices received for agricultural commodities were eligible to receive EE loans (USDA, FSA, 2011). The FSA guaranteed loan program guarantees loans made and serviced by commercial banks, the cooperative Farm Credit System, and other credit providers to eligible borrowers. This guarantee protects lenders against losses if the borrower does not meet their loan obligations by providing a guarantee of up to 95 percent of the loss of loan principal and interest. The guaranteed loan program consists of FO and OL loan types. In addition to direct FO loan purposes, guaranteed FO loans may be used to refinance debt."}, {"section_title": "Organization", "text": "Chapter 2 of this thesis contains a literature review of studies related to this study.

Chapter 6 summarizes and interprets the econometric analysis, presents the conclusions, and includes future research recommendations."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 2: Literature Review", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Literature Review", "text": "Many studies have been conducted in the recent past that use ARMS data and/or FSA data. While none of these studies have used FSA data to identify the frequency of respondent error in ARMS, they have looked into issues that surround the ARMS and the effectiveness of FSA loan programs. The following review of these studies covers four main topics: credit usage and debt, ARMS usability, nonresponse in ARMS, and FSA's farm loan programs. Lastly, a study that influences the current study's model specification is reviewed. Katchova (2005) examined the borrower's decision to use credit. Katchova's study identified the characteristics of individuals and farm operations that determine what influenced farm credit usage, the amount of credit, and number of loans. Katchova's research on credit usage provides insights into factors which are more likely to impact non-response or inaccurate reporting on questions regarding debt. Katchova's study sought to examine from the demandside of agricultural credit by using 2001 ARMS data from borrowers and non-borrowers by farm typology: rural residence farms, intermediate farms, and commercial farms (Hoppe and MacDonald, 2013). One stipulation of the demand-side of agricultural credit is that the credit decision is jointly made between the lender and borrower. Therefore, the lender can affect the availability of funds to the farmer by restricting, rejecting, or modifying the funds. Katchova used a Probit model to identify the characteristics of farmers who are more likely to have debt."}, {"section_title": "Credit Usage and Debt", "text": "For those farmers that do use credit, Katchova used a truncated regression model to estimate the level of indebtedness. Lastly, she used a truncated Poisson model to determine the number of loans. Katchova's results show farms most likely to have debt are rural residence, intermediate farms, and commercial farms that have higher gross farm income. Older farmers of rural residences and intermediate size farms were less likely to have debt. Operator's age and income were the biggest influences on the degree in indebtedness. Lastly, farms with higher gross income and crop insurance tend to use more loans to finance their farming operation. Briggeman, Koenig, and Moss (2012) discussed the importance of accurate and reliable farm debt data so that such data may be used to identify and lessen the effect of economic downswings in the agricultural sector. As an example, they discussed the buildup to and the occurrence of the farm debt crisis in the early 1980s. Up until the late 1990s and early 2000s, the USDA had more information to estimate U.S. farm debt. USDA suspended state level accounts of farm debt because of the complication of using commercial bank data to estimate farm debt at the state level. With the reduction of these data sources, the ARMS became more important in estimating farm debt levels but the farm debt estimate also became less consistent (Briggeman, Koenig, and Moss, 2012). Briggeman, Koenig, and Moss compare USDA's estimate of farm sector real estate debt to the sum of Farm Credit System and commercial bank real estate debt for 1985-2010. They argue there was a break in the estimate of farm sector real estate debt in 2000. While before 2000, the positive difference between the two series did not drastically change from year to year. However, the difference went to about zero in 2003 and remained near zero. In fact, the farm sector real estate debt reported by USDA was less than the debt reported by the Farm Credit System and commercial banks for several years. If real estate debt from other lenders was added, the difference would be even greater. This suggested there may be a sizable under-estimation of real estate debt by the ARMS. Briggeman, Koenig, and Moss suggested the ARMS's respondents and the questionnaire structure may limit the ability to compute accurate, total farm debt amount. One category of respondents the ARMS does not cover is landowners who do not farm, which is also known as non-operator landlords. Farmland has influenced the amount of assets and collateral for debt reported on the agricultural sector balance sheet. While ARMS used debt numbers reported by the Farm Credit System and commercial banks, ARMS also subtracted out any non-farm debt. Subsequently, ARMS may underestimate farmland value and the debt on the farmland. ARMS does ask about loans from non-traditional sources; however, some questions and the structure of the farm debt section of the survey may be difficult for respondents to comprehend. The study suggested altering some questions and reordering other questions."}, {"section_title": "ARMS Usability", "text": "Ellinger, Ahrendsen, and Moss (2012) analyzed the possible implications of the economic measures listed on the farm firm's financial statements. By examining accounting principles and the ARMS questionnaire, certain items were found that limit ARMS data from fully gauging economic and financial conditions. These limitations impacted asset valuation, income and expense recognition, and extraordinary income reporting. In particular, data limitations could cause understatement of leverage, overstatement of liquidity, and under reporting of year-to-year farm income variability measures. Improved farm financial condition measures could be made by lessening the data limitations according to Ellinger, Ahrendsen, and Moss. Featherstone, Park, and Weber (2012) examined how to obtain more information from the ARMS. They considered issues revolving around survey nonresponse, pseudo panels, and frequent updating of cost-of-production data on an enterprise basis. Featherstone, Park, and Weber found three issues were in need of further research: nonresponse, refining methods to develop pseudo panel data, and developing methods to compile commodity specific financial data between the different commodity surveys. Ahrendsen and Katchova (2012) discussed the financial performance calculated and reported from ARMS by the USDA Economic Research Service (ERS). They compared the financial measures to the recommended financial measures of the Farm Financial Standards Council (FFSC, 2015). The financial measures reported by ERS were duplicated and compared and contrasted to four other methods to calculate financial performance measures. Ahrendsen and Katchova recommended that ERS: 1) use the FFSC financial measure recommendations, 2) assess the policy for flagging estimates as statistically unreliable, 3) report medians, and 4) add the percentage of farm businesses that have financial values within critical zones. Blank and Klinefelter (2012) posited that the usefulness and relevance of the ARMS data can be improved by refining the sample frame. Originally, the ARMS was created to meet Congress's requirement that data be collected on the production costs of wheat, feed grains, cotton, and dairy; therefore, not all states were sampled. This meant the farmers sampled provided a sufficient cross section of production cost data for those commodities listed, but did not provide sufficient information on other commodities or regions. Additionally, the people included in the survey may not be sufficiently representative because economic performance varies across both farm size and commodity specialization. The handful of targeted commodities did not provide a representative sample across all commodities since states not sampled may be more livestock extensive (Mountain region) while small grain operations in the Midwest region are over-represented. Therefore, ARMS needs to sample people by farm size and commodity strata. Furthermore, the survey's respondent burden tended to be heavier for large farms since they are fewer in number, and are surveyed more often than smaller operations. Blank and Klinefelter suggested respondent burden could be reduced for large farms by designing the survey for farm size, base questions on relevance, and make questions easier to understand by rewording them. Miller, Robbins, and Habiger (2010) examined the challenges of missing data in the ARMS Phase III. According to their study, unit non-response (whole survey refused) and item non-response (certain items refused) lead to missing data that requires special handling during statistical analysis. To help alleviate this issue, NASS imputed information into missing items for any variables used in the published summary statistics. The NASS procedure eliminated outliers in the data then they use conditional averages equivalent to a regression on categorical variables. Millar, Robbins, and Habiger (2010) selected around 100 variables from the ARMS Phase III to analyze. They conducted a detailed study of data plots and various aspects of the variables (continuous, categorical, or censored). One effect of mean imputation is that it reduces the variation in the data set. While imputation was usually done at a small rate, higher rates of imputation can cause a large downward bias in the variance in the data set. Millar, Robbins, and Habiger examined the distributions before and after machine imputation, and confirmed imputation altered the distribution. Lastly, the mean becomes biased if non-respondents are not like the respondents in regards to the item's value. Earp et al. (2008) examined the effect calibration has on non-response bias in the ARMS Phase III. Non-response bias was potentially higher for the ARMS Phase III due to lower response rates, and NASS weighted the respondent sample so the estimated/calibrated variable totals for a large subset of items match target values from other sources (Earp et al., 2008). They Earp et al. found calibration weighting reduced bias in 90 percent of the study variables so that they were no longer significantly different from zero via a t-test. Of these variables, 50 percent had a significant reduction in bias levels via a paired t-test. One variable, fertilizer expenses, still had a significant bias via t-test after calibration. According to Earp et al., calibration appears to be an effective tool for reducing non-response bias."}, {"section_title": "Nonresponse in ARMS", "text": "The study by Gerling, Tran, and Earp (2008) examined the most common reasons for nonresponse in the 2006 ARMS III for Washington State. The ARMS Phase III generally has response rates lower than 80%, and has a potential to have a higher nonresponse bias than the other ARMS phases (Gerling, Tran, and Earp, 2008). While administering the ARMS Phase III, field enumerators asked operators who had declined to cooperate on the ARMS to explain why they refused to complete the survey. Gerling, Tran, and Earp found the top three reasons for refusal were: would not take time, will not do financial surveys, and information too personal. However, further research needs to be conducted to determine if results are survey, regional, or national specific. In summary, they recommended adding a cell to the survey for recording the reason for nonresponse. Next, Weber and Clay (2013) analyzed non-response in the ARMS. According to Weber and Clay, approximately a third of sampled farming operators ignore the entire ARMS. Weber and Clay use the Census of Agriculture data in their study because the data provides information on ARMS respondents and non-respondents, and the data comes from the same questionnaire collected for both respondents and non-respondents. Initially, Weber and Clay began exploring the motivations and characteristics associated with non-response, and the differences in point estimates of two econometric models when estimated on two subsamples. One subsample consists of respondents, and the other subsample consists of a random drawing from a group of respondents and non-respondents. Weber and Clay found response rates decrease monotonically with increasing farm size. Also, non-responding farm operators have greater sales than respondent farm operators. Weber and Clay found minimal nonresponse bias in the two econometric models they estimated. Reasons for non-response are many, but the most common reason for nonresponse is that the respondents will not take the time or are too busy to take the survey (Weber and Clay 2013). Some other reasons are the respondents will not fill out financial surveys, and the survey is too personal. The reasons imply that farm operators may be unwilling to provide personal information or farm operators may believe the information will be used against them. According to Weber and Clay, larger farms take more time to fill out the survey, and incur greater disutility from the task. Additionally, production has moved to larger operations that may have a greater legal and contractual complexity. Agriculture. Across all of the years, Weber and Clay had 189,474 matched observations of which 67% were ARMS respondents, 28% were refusals, and 5% were inaccessible. Weber and Clay grouped variables into three categories: household characteristics, farm characteristics, and farm specialization. Weber and Clay estimated a Probit model to explore nonresponse patterns. Their Probit model outcome was whether or not the farm operator responded to the survey. They found that the multivariate analysis supported most of the findings from the descriptive comparisons. As farm size increases, the probability of response decreases. Grain specialty farms had the lowest probability of responding while dairy farms were most likely to respond. Weber and Clay found that with every hour decrease in time necessary to fill out the ARMS, the probability of response increases by seven percent. Weber and Clay used two econometric models to examine nonresponse bias. One was a model of labor market participation of the principal farm operator. The other model examined farm diversification discount. The model on labor market participation of the principal farm operator was a Probit model, and used variables such as operator age, operator experience, household size, commodity specialization, and region. The second model was constructed to examine whether diversified farms are discounted by the market similar to what has been found for corporate firms. The main explanatory variable was an indicator of farm diversification. The farm was either diversified across livestock and crops or they were specialized in either crops or livestock. The labor participation model coefficient estimates found age increased the likelihood of working off-farm, but at a decreasing rate. The probability of working off-farm decreased with farm size as well. Next, Weber and Clay found nonresponse bias in coefficient estimates was small in degree and low in frequency across both models. Lastly, they found nonresponse bias was unlikely to weaken conclusions based on econometric models using ARMS data. While Weber and Clay did not include loan debt in their analysis, their findings may give context to why respondents may refuse or inaccurately report their debt. For example, Weber and Clay found grain farms had the lowest response probability, and the current study utilizes a crop variable as an explanatory variable."}, {"section_title": "FSA's Farm Loan Programs", "text": "Ahrendsen et al. 2011estimated a triple hurdle model of U.S. commercial bank usage of the FSA's guaranteed OL and interest assistance programs in order to identify the farm and banking variables that affect the bank's decision to use loan guarantee and interest assistance. They examined annual data on U.S. commercial banks from 1995-2003 in their model. Ahrendsen et al. found the farm debt servicing ratio, individual bank loan-to-asset ratio, bank size, and general guaranteed loan and interest assistance environment variables to all be statistically significant in all three hurdles. Another study by Dixon, Ahrendsen, and McCollum (1999) examined characteristics of banks and/or economic forces that influence the level of FSA loan guarantee programs commercial banks had within Arkansas, and they examined factors affecting the volume of loss claims. They used a six-equation model that is comprised of three double hurdle sub-models, and estimated as Probit equations. Dixon, Ahrendsen, and McCollum found more OL loans than FO loans in Arkansas, and commercial banks used guaranteed loans to add to the security of riskier loans. Commercial banks with certified or approved lender status were more likely to use guaranteed loans. Commercial banks with more guaranteed loans tend to have loss claims, and commercial banks who filed loss claims in the past were associated with filing loss claims in the present. Despite the consolidation of commercial banks, research did not find a reduction in the amount of FSA guaranteed loans made by commercial banks. Lastly, Nwoha et al. (2007) focused on whether FSA direct loan targeting for beginning farmers and SDA farmers was financially necessary and utilized ARMS data from 2000-2003. Nwoha et al. utilized the delete-a-group jackknife procedure to determine whether differences in means for certain variables were statistically significant between: 1) FSA direct loan eligible recipient and non-FSA direct loan eligible recipient, 2) SDA race and SDA gender, 3) SDA race and non-SDA, 4) SDA gender and non-SDA, and 5) beginning farmer and non-beginning farmer. Nwoha et al. used the financial characteristics solvency, liquidity, profitability, repayment capacity, and financial efficiency to compare the two groups. Nwoha et al. found weaker financial characteristics for FSA direct loan eligible farm operations relative non-FSA direct loan eligible operations. The financial ratios of SDA race and SDA gender were found to not be statistically different from one another. However, Nwoha et al. found SDA gender farms have significantly less farm assets, liabilities, equity, and gross and net cash farm incomes and smaller debt-to-asset ratio than non-SDA farms. Nwoha et al. found beginning farmers had a much smaller financial size (income statement and balance sheet measures) than non-beginning farmers. This indicated that the beginning farmer program was targeted to a set of farmers that were vastly different than regular FSA borrowers."}, {"section_title": "Model Specification", "text": "Dixon et al. 2007 included debt-to-asset ratio, net worth, ratio of non-farm income to total cash farm income sources, ratio of balance available for debt service to total debt service due that year, and total annual household net cash income. Dixon et al. posited that borrowers with higher net worth, income diversification, repayment capacity, and income should have graduated from the direct FLP sooner. Dixon et al. found borrowers were less likely to exit when they had higher numbers of active FSA direct loans at loan origination. Borrowers were more likely to exit and continue farming or voluntarily leave farming when they had less FSA direct loan involvement. Borrowers were more likely to leave farming voluntarily, and less likely to graduate from the direct FLP when they had higher debt-to-asset ratios; however, the opposite was found for those borrowers with higher net worth at origination. Borrowers were more likely to exit involuntarily when they had prior financial difficulties. Non-white borrowers were less likely to voluntarily leave farming. Beginning farmer loan borrowers were less likely to continue in the FLP and more likely to voluntarily leave farming. The results in general indicated FSA borrowers were not becoming permanent FSA clients, and FSA's goals were being met. Dixon et al. suggested strengthening financial requirements to loan origination in order to minimize farmers who come across financial hardship and left farming. However, strengthened financial requirements could exclude some of the farmers who were the intended recipients of the FSA direct FLP."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 3: Data and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Sources", "text": "FSA provided data on active direct and guaranteed loans as of December 31 for calendar years 2001, 2004, 2006, and 2007 for borrowers who were ARMS respondents in the corresponding year. The FSA direct FLP data included the following information: state ID, POID, principal outstanding, interest outstanding, delinquent loan amount, adverse action loan amount (foreclosure, bankruptcy, or acceleration loan amounts), number of loans 90 days past due, average days past due, FSA score (like a credit rating), average interest rate, total direct FLP principal and interest outstanding, total FO principal and interest outstanding, total OL principal and interest outstanding, total emergency loan (EM) principal and interest outstanding, total economic emergency loan (EE) principal and interest outstanding, Black borrower identifier, Hispanic borrower identifier, Asian/Pacific Islander identifier, American Indian identifier, woman identifier, and beginning farmer (BF) identifier. The FSA guaranteed FLP data included the following borrower loan level information: state ID, POID, outstanding balance, initial loan amount, closing date, fiscal year, loan obligation date, maturity date, loan obligation number, assistance type, program type, fund code, interest assistance percentage, line of credit (LOC) indicator, LOC amount, originating lender, lender branch number, lender type code, fixed or variable rate indicator, borrower interest rate, lender interest rate, loan purpose code, and delinquency code. The direct FLP data were aggregated to the POID for the 2006 and 2007. In other words, all loan data per borrower was summed or averaged to a single line of information for that borrower; whereas, direct 2001 and 2004 and guaranteed data had each borrower's loan(s) listed. Since the guaranteed FLP data and direct FLP data for 2001 and 2004 were at the loan level, aggregation to the borrower level was done so the data were similar to the 2006 and 2007 direct FLP data. This aggregation made it impossible to use variables on specific loan dates or originating lender. The project also used data from the USDA's Phase III of ARMS. Using the POID, the FSA and ARMS data were merged for each year. In particular, the ARMS includes production, financial, and demographic information for the farm operator and household. ARMS data also includes summary variables calculated by ERS and NASS as well as data added to correct for inconsistencies and missing data. Specific variables include information such as: acres operated, rent received/paid, livestock production, income data, operating and capital expenditures, use of time, farm assets, farm debt, operator and spouse information, and operator and household information. The enumerator includes information on operator records use and operator records type. The project is concerned with farm debt. The ARMS farm debt section includes information on: whether the operation has a positive debt balance at the end of the year, and if it does, there is a table with questions on what is the lender type, loan balance outstanding, loan interest rate, and other items for each loan up to a maximum of five loans in years 2001, 2004, and 2006, and four loans in year 2007. The farm debt section also includes how many additional loans and additional aggregated loan amount the operator has that are not in the maximum of four or five loans reported in detail in the debt-by-lender table. ERS computes the following variables: rate of return on assets (ROA), rate of return on equity (ROE), debt-to-asset ratio (DAR), and operating profit margin (OPM). By using the FSA data and the ARMS Phase III data, comparison of debt information provided by the FSA to the debt information reported in ARMS was able to be conducted."}, {"section_title": "Dependent Variable", "text": "The current study seeks to identify factors related to whether the respondent accurately or inaccurately reports having positive debt levels on the ARMS. In particular, a multinomial logit model 2 is estimated to identify those variables that indicate how a respondent answers the ARMS III farm debt question: \"Did this operation owe any money to any banks, co-ops, individuals, merchants, or Federal agencies at the end of\" the survey's respective calendar year. 3 This will be referred to as the \"Owe Money\" question and is the dependent variable of the multinomial logit model. The question has three possible responses: yes, no, and refusal. If the respondent answers \"yes\", they continue in the Farm Debt section to the designated debt-by-lender table of loanspecific questions. As previously discussed, the debt-by-lender table has questions on a per loan basis about lender type, loan balance outstanding, loan interest rate, etc. For example, the 2007 ARMS also asks questions on loan type, when loan will be repaid, loan origination date, loan term, loan purpose, interest rate type, frequency of repricing, and loan payments. 4 If the respondent answers \"no\" to the \"Owe Money\" question, they are directed to the next section of the ARMS, and zeros are recorded in the debt-by-lender table. When the respondent refuses to answer, a negative one is recorded for the response to the \"Owe Money\" question and for the responses in the debt-by-lender table. 2 Greene (2011) equation 18.5, page 763. 3 Phase III of ARMS for 2006 and 2007 added after the question \"include money owed against your line of credit. Exclude CCC loans.\" 4 The 2006 ARMS also asks questions on frequency of loan principal repayment and periodic repayments. The 2004 ARMS also asks questions on farm purpose percentage and loan guarantee. More information can be found at http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/arms-farm-financial-and-crop-productionpractices/questionnaires-and-manuals.aspx#27921 When a question's response is recorded by the USDA, a number is associated with the variable corresponding to the question. The \"Owe Money\" question does not have a variable number associated with it for 2001 and 2004, but it does have a variable number 1058associated with it for 2006 and 2007. Since recorded information is only available for the \"Owe Money\" question for 2006 and 2007, a proxy for the \"Owe Money\" question needs to be used so the 2001 and 2004 observations can be used. The ERS imputed a proxy variable (P999) for the \"Owe Money\" question, and a detailed description of the variable is given in Banker et al. (2010). When the entire debt-by-lender table was refused by the respondent, P999 equals one (and corresponds to refusing to answer the Owe Money question). When the respondent indicated no debt was outstanding, P999 equals three (and corresponds to answering \"no\" to the \"Owe Money\" question). Lastly, P999 equals zero when the respondent provided outstanding loan information in the debt-by-lender table (and corresponds to answering \"yes\" to the \"Owe Money\" question). Since all respondents in the current study have outstanding FSA FLP debt at the end of the calendar year, all non-refusal respondents should answer \"yes\" to the \"Owe Money\" question, and all should have a P999 value of zero. By using the constructed P999 variable (DEBT_PROX) for all of the four years in the sample, respondents accurately reporting whether they have debt at the end of the year can be determined."}, {"section_title": "Independent Variable Considerations for the Models", "text": "When hypothesizing relevant independent variables for the models, the variables available in the combined data from the FSA FLP loan database and ARMS are examined.

The amount of outstanding debt (FSADEBTTOTK) should be a highly relevant factor related to whether the borrower accurately reports their debt or not. If a respondent's FSA debt is small, the respondent may not report the operation owes money, especially if the operation does not have other debt. PASTDUE_IND is a delinquency indicator equaling one when any of the aggregated loans has a days past due of one or more days for that year; otherwise, zero. INTRATE is the average interest rate for the direct loans for a particular borrower. Katchova 2005 (2001, 2004, 2006, and 2007) Note: TOTEM = Yes, if the operation has one or more EM loans; No otherwise. Note: TOTEE = Yes, if the operation has one or more EE loans; No otherwise. Selection of loan type usually depends on the intended use of the borrowed funds; therefore, it was important to capture any effects that loan type may have on accuracy of debt reporting. Since operating loans are short to intermediate term loans that are typically paid off early in the year, borrowers may not report them because they are paid off by the time the ARMS Phase III survey is administered in March and April; whereas, FO loans are long term loans and will likely have an outstanding balance for many years. A borrower with more than one type of loan should have an easier time remembering to report their FSA debt. FSA Guaranteed FLP variables are: FSADEBTTOTK, BORR_GUAR_INT_RATE, FO_GTE, OL_GTE, OL_LOC_GTE, and MULT_LN_GTE. FSADEBTTOTK is the same as defined previously. BORR_GUAR_INT_RATE is the average interest rate of the borrower's guaranteed loans. FO_GTE, OL_GTE, OL_LOC_GTE, and MULT_LN_GTE indicate whether the borrower has only FO loans, only OL loans, only OL LOC loans, or has multiple loans types (FO, OL, and/or OL LOC). OL line of credit loans are unique to the guaranteed FLP dataset because FSA does not make direct FLP OL line of credit loans. The reasoning behind choosing these variables is the same as for direct loans. Operator demographic variables give insight into the differences in characteristics among those operators who accurately report their debt, those operators who do not, and those who refuse to report. Operator demographic variables include: OP_AGE, HS_EDUC, SC_EDUC, CGB_EDUC, OP_SDA_P, and BF_ELIG. OP_AGE is a continuous age (in years) variable to reflect any effects age has on reporting accuracy. Previous studies indicated operator age has an impact on response outcome on the ARMS (Weber and Clay, 2013). Katchova (2005) (Katchova, 2005). The level of education an operator has obtained may have an effect on the level of debt reporting accuracy. HS_EDUC is a binary variable that equals one when an operator has a high school or less education; otherwise, zero. SC_EDUC is a binary variable equaling one when an operator has some college education; otherwise, zero. CGB_EDUC is a binary variable equaling one when an operator is a college graduate and beyond; otherwise, zero. OP_SDA_P is a binary variable created using ARMS and FSA data. Reporting race or ethnicity on the FSA farm loan application is voluntary unless borrowers are applying for a SDA loan (USDA, FSA, 2015b). To circumvent this limitation, both FSA data and ARMS data were used to construct a SDA eligible variable equaling one when the borrower is SDA eligible; otherwise, zero. This is similar to the process used by Nwoha et al. (2007). A borrower is considered as an SDA when identified as such by either the FSA or ARMS data. This includes: 1) identified as a racial-ethnic minority or female in the FSA guaranteed FLP or direct FLP data or 2) when they indicated to be a racialethnic minority or female in the ARMS survey. BF_ELIG is a binary variable indicating whether an operator is beginning farmer eligible. The BF_ELIG variable is constructed by subtracting the year the operator began operating any operation from the ARMS survey year. Any operator with ten years or less of farming experience is considered to be a beginning farmer. Previous studies have indicated that socially disadvantaged farmers and beginning farmers have different characteristics and/or exhibit different behaviors compared to other FSA borrowers (Dixon et al., 2007;Nwoha et al., 2007). The variables included in operation characteristics are: crop ratio (CROP_RATIO) and gross cash farm income measured in thousands of dollars (IGCFIK). A crop ratio (intensity) variable was computed by dividing the value of crop production by total production. Previous studies have determined agricultural type by proportion revenues from crops because crop operations have greater variation in revenues due to weather events (Settlage et al., 2001;Dixon et al. 2004). Weber and Clay (2013) found farm production specialization to impact the probability of responding to ARMS. Additionally, crop operations tend to have more borrowed capital for operating expenses (Settlage et al., 2001). IGCFIK is a good indicator of operation size. As stated in the literature review, larger operations have a higher ARMS non-response rate (Weber and Clay 2013). Katchova (2005) found farms with higher gross farm income are more likely to report debt and tend to report a greater number of loans. IGCFIK was included to capture any effects operation size has on reporting accuracy. In order to capture any effects from a particular survey year, a binary variable was computed for each year. Y2001 indicates ARMS survey year 2001. Y2004 indicates 2004, Y2006 indicates 2006, and Y2007 indicates 2007."}, {"section_title": "Other Independent Variables Considered", "text": "Other variables were also considered in preliminary models, but were not included in the final model. In both the Direct FLP (DIR) model and the Guaranteed FLP (GTE) model, a multiple loan program variable (MULT_PROG) was substituted for the loan type variables. Although most borrowers had only direct loans or only guaranteed loans, there are some borrowers with both direct and guaranteed loans. 5 MULT_PROG was tried to determine if multiple loan program borrowers reported their debt differently from those with just one loan program type. When MULT_PROG was included, the significance of the gross cash farm income coefficient in the refusal vector of the direct model became insignificant and the multiprogram coefficients were insignificant, and there were no other changes. Guaranteed borrowers operate larger farms than direct borrowers; therefore, in the direct model MULT_PROG is a proxy for farm size. Having more than one FLP type was concluded to not have a major impact on the outcome; therefore, the multiple loan program variable was omitted from the models. For the guaranteed FLP model, lender guaranteed interest rate (LEND_GUAR_INT_RATE) and interest assistance indicator (IA_IND) were originally included. Having these two variables instead of the borrower guaranteed interest rate (BORR_GUAR_INT_RATE) did not change the parameter estimates notably and significance levels. BORR_GUAR_INT_RATE was used due to its similarity with the Direct FLP interest rate (INTRATE) variable. Initially, MARRIED was included in the direct FLP and guaranteed FLP models; however, MARRIED showed no significance and made no substantive changes to either model when it was excluded. Also, two percent of MARRIED had missing values (55 of 2,696 observations for the direct FLP model and 51 of 2,714 for the guaranteed FLP model), which contributed to the decision to exclude it from the final models. Number of household members (HH_SIZE) was also included in the direct FLP and guaranteed FLP models but it was found to be statistically insignificant. Some studies have used number of household members when determining who does not respond to the ARMS (Weber and Clay, 2013). However, the number of household members did not make any substantial changes to the estimated model coefficients when it was included; therefore, the variable was excluded from the final models. Farm organizational type (LEGAL_STAT) was also initially included since more complex organizations may be more likely to refuse to answer questions since their finances may be more difficult to incorporate in the debt-by-lender table. However, the \"other\" organizational type had very few observations. This is consistent with FSA's charge to lend to family-sized operations, which are primarily sole proprietorships. Weber and Clay (2013) found farm organizational type had an effect on response to the ARMS. However, when they re-estimated their model without farm size, the sign on the organizational type coefficient changed suggesting a relationship between farm size and organizational complexity. As previously mentioned, some responses were provided by the NASS enumerator after the completion of the interview. One of these questions asked how often the respondent refers to records: all of the time, most of the time, some of the time, almost never, or never (USDA, NASS, p. 32, 2001). In order to reduce the five responses to three responses, all of the time and most of the time were combined into one response: most of the time. Some of the time and almost never was combined into one response: some of the time. The three responses to the question were: most of the time, some of the time, and never. Hypothetically, respondents who refer to records most of the time should be more accurate when reporting their debt on the survey. The record usage question (RECORD_USE) showed up as highly significant, supporting the hypothesis. However, many previously significant variables became insignificant in the direct and guaranteed models. Since RECORD_USE had 22.5 percent missing observations for the direct FLP model and 27.9 percent missing observations for the guaranteed FLP when estimated without RECORD_USE, the impact of RECORD_USE was pursued in more detail. The sample was restricted to observations with non-missing RECORD_USE values. Then RECORD_USE was omitted from the models to see if the change in coefficient significance resulted from RECORD_USE being included in the model or as a result of the large decrease in non-missing observations from the original sample. The significant variables in the original model lost significance because of the large change in sample size in the direct FLP and guaranteed FLP models; therefore, RECORD_USE was omitted from the models to allow use of the larger sample. Another variable initially included in the models was household earned income (EARNED). Inclusion of this variable did not change other model parameter estimates nor was it significant. Total capital expenses (CAPEXP_TOTK) was considered, but CAPEXP_TOTK has a large number of missing observations so it was not included in the models. Some other variables considered were: depreciation expense ratio (DEPER), ROA, and total assets (ATOT). Adding DEPER to the models caused the significant coefficient on IGCFIK to lose significance in both the direct and guaranteed FLP multinomial models. Also, the significance on the \"no\" intercept in the Direct FLP multinomial model and the significance on the \"refusal\" intercept in the guaranteed FLP multinomial model lost significance. Adding ROA to the models caused the significant IGCFIK coefficient for the \"refusal\" outcome to lose significance. Otherwise, ROA did not change other model parameter estimates nor was it significant. Lastly, the addition of ATOT to the models caused the significant IGCFIK coefficient to lose significance in both direct and guaranteed models. The significant coefficient on OL LOC for the \"no\" outcome also lost significance. Otherwise, ATOT did not change other model parameter estimates nor was it significant. Other variables considered were found to be either computed or imputed from the ARMS farm debt portion of the survey, i.e., these variables are not independent of the \"Owe Money\" responses so they are at least partially endogenous. For example in the debt-by-lender table in the ARMS, respondents give their total principal and interest outstanding per loan listed, and this information is used to compute total debt (DTOT). However, principal and interest outstanding is only in the debt-by-lender table if the respondent answered yes to the \"Owe Money\" question, which is the dependent variable for the models. Therefore, DTOT is dependent on \"Owe Money\". In another example, interest expense (EFINT) is imputed in some situations using debt information from the debt-by-lender table. If a respondent indicated having zero interest expense in the expense section of ARMS, but indicated having loan debt in the debt section, then NASS estimates interest expense from the reported loan debt (USDA, NASS, 2009a). Likewise, if loan debt is indicated to be zero, but the respondent reported interest expense in the expense section, then the loan debt amount is estimated from the reported interest expense. Hence, EFINT is computed from the debt-by-lender table in some cases. Other variables initially considered, but were found to be dependent on the farm debt portion of the survey are: DAR, operating profit margin (OPM), and net working capital to expense ratio (NWC_EXPENSE_RATIO)."}, {"section_title": "Model Type and Specification", "text": "As was briefly discussed earlier, a multinomial logit model (Greene, 2011) is estimated to identify those variables that indicate how a respondent answers the \"Owe Money\" question. The dependent variable is the ARMS question asking respondents if the operation owes money to any banks, co-ops, individuals, merchants, or Federal agencies at the end of that survey's respective calendar year. This question may be used to determine the proportion of respondents responding erroneously since all respondents should answer \"yes\" if they have not refused to answer the question. The dependent variable, DEBT_PROX, has three nominal outcomes (yes, no, refusal), making the multinomial logit regression model an appropriate empirical model.  Table 3.3. In the first sub-model for a given program (direct FLP or guaranteed FLP), a binary logit model was estimated by deleting the refusal observations. In the second sub-model, the no responses were eliminated while the refusal responses were included. The yes responses were not eliminated since they make up 82.8 percent of the Direct FLP multinomial model observations and 85.5 percent of the Guaranteed FLP multinomial model observations. The practical approach to addressing IIA concerns was to compare the resulting parameter estimates from the two sub-models with the corresponding vector of coefficients from the full model. The percentage changes in the coefficients were computed from the full model and the sub models. The resulting differences in percentage terms generally ranged from -10 percent to 10 percent. However, the guaranteed FLP program had a larger percentage change for most coefficients with a range of -20 percent to 20 percent and one coefficient in the direct FLP,  (Allison, 2012;Cheng and Long, 2007). In the event that the IIA assumption could be rejected, two binomial models were estimated: direct FLP and guaranteed FLP. The \"yes\" and \"refusal\" outcomes were combined together since the \"yes\" and \"refusal\" outcomes had similar summary statistics on their independent variables when compared to those of the \"no\" outcome. The estimates for the Direct FLP binomial model can be found in Table 5.2 and the Guaranteed FLP binomial model in Table   5.4. The summary statistics for the Direct FLP and Guaranteed FLP binomial models can be found in Appendix A and Appendix B. The implications of these binomial models relative to the multinomial models are discussed below. (12.9 percent) of the weighted observations are in DEBT_PROX's \"no\" outcome. This shows inaccuracy of reporting since an estimated 12.9 percent (13.6 percent of the sample) of the respondents answered \"no\" when they should have answered yes because they have outstanding FSA debt. This result indicates that respondents are not always reporting their information on the ARMS correctly, and other sections of the ARMS may experience inaccurately reporting as well.  (2001, 2004, 2006, and 2007) For most variables sample n=2,696 and weighted n=156,693. Record type variables, record use variables, and CAPEXP_TOTK have sample n=1,775 and weighted n=121,302.

DTOTK accounts for current and long-term liabilities and is the summation of farm liabilities from all lender types. For the \"yes\" and \"refusal\" outcomes, DTOTK of $222 thousand and $148 thousand are more than FSADEBTTOTK of $133 thousand and $136 thousand which is expected. Since the data are from only one lender (FSA), DTOTK should be far greater than FSADEBTTOTK. And the difference is significant (p < 0.01) for the \"yes\" outcome, although the difference is insignificant for the refusal respondents. The \"no\" outcome has a mean DTOTK of $3 thousand and FSADEBTTOTK has a mean of $80 thousand and the difference is statistically significant (p < 0.01). Since \"no\" respondents indicate they have zero debt in the Farm Debt section of the ARMS, the amount of debt reported on the ARMS is greatly under-estimated. For the estimated 20,204 operators responding \"no\" over the four years 2001, 2004, 2006, and 2007, an estimate of the amount of debt under reported is $1.554 billion or a simple average of $389 million per year. This is 6.5 percent of the $5.980 billion average reported by the Economic Research Service for FSA direct loans for those same four years (USDA, ERS, 2015b). However, an estimated 7.8 percent of the 20,204 operators had guaranteed loans in addition to direct loans so that the $389 million includes mostly direct FLP loans but also some guaranteed loans originated by other lenders. As stated in the literature review, the study by Briggeman, Koenig, and Moss (2012) found the amount of debt reported by lenders when added together was more than the amount of debt reported on the ARMS. The current study shows that one problem area for under-reporting of debt lies with those respondents indicating they have no outstanding debt at the end of the year when they should be indicating yes. Additionally, the summary statistics show DTOTK and LCTOTK are the same amount which indicates DTOTK is only reflecting current liabilities for the respondents answering \"no\" on the ARMS. Operations responding \"no\" to the \"Owe Money\" question have significantly less FSA debt than those responding \"yes\" (p < 0.01) or refusing to answer (p < 0.10). For the other independent variables in the Direct FLP multinomial model, the average age for respondents range between 51-55 years of age with 51.7 years of age being the overall mean. The \"yes\" respondents are about four years younger than the \"refusal\" (p < 0.10) and \"no\" (p < 0.01) respondents on average. Overall, 49.5 percent of the respondents have a high school or less education. A lower share of respondents refusing to answer the \"Owe Money\" question (0.185) have some college education than respondents answering \"yes\" (0.331) or \"no\" (0.283), although the difference is only significant (p < 0.01) for the \"yes' respondents. A smaller share of respondents refusing to answer the \"Owe Money\" question (0.07) are SDA eligible operators compared to those answering \"yes\" (0.21, p < 0.01) or \"no\" (0.20, p < 0.05). Additionally, respondents refusing to answer the \"Owe Money\" question have a lower mean ratio (0.02) of beginning farmer eligible operators compared to those answering \"yes\" (0.16, p < 0.01) or \"no\" (0.14, p < 0.05). The summary statistics for RECORD_USE support our hypothesis since respondents answering \"yes\" to the \"Owe Money\" question have a mean ratio of 0.68 for RECORD_USE_MOT compared to a mean ratio of 0.38 for RECORD_USE_MOT for those answering \"no.\" Also, respondents answering \"no\" have a higher mean ratio (0.42) of RECORD_USE_NEV compared to the mean ratio (0.38) for using RECORDS_USE_MOT. We also observe operators answering \"no\" have a slightly higher mean ratio for CROP_RATIO (0.54) than those answering \"yes\" (0.46) or refusing to answer (0.45), although the difference is statistically insignificant. The summary statistics show respondents refusing to answer and those responding \"yes\" have a statistically higher mean IGCFI ($268 thousand and $209 thousand) than those responding \"no\" ($127 thousand). The summary statistics partially reflect what was stated in the literature review. Weber and Clay (2013) found that the probability of response decreases as farm size increases. However, the summary statistics presented here show that the \"refusal\" and \"yes\" respondent operations are larger than the \"no\" operations when size is measured by IGCFI, total expenses (ETOT), net cash farm income (INCFI), and total assets (ATOT). Table 4.2 displays the summary statistics for the dependent and independent variables in the guaranteed FLP multinomial model and other variables of interest. The summary statistics show the mean and bootstrap standard errors for each of the dependent variable (DEBT_PROX) outcomes (yes, no, refusal). Of the 91,771 weighted observations for the dependent variable (DEBT_PROX) outcomes (yes, no, refusal), 78,486 (85.5 percent) are in DEBT_PROX's \"yes\" outcome and 4,197 (4.6 percent) are in DEBT_PROX's \"refusal\" outcome and 9,087 (9.9 percent) are in DEBT_PROX's \"no\" outcome. This shows inaccuracy of reporting since an estimated 9.9 percent (9.5 percent of the sample) of the respondents answered \"no\" when they should have answered yes because they have outstanding debt guaranteed by FSA.  (2001, 2004, 2006, and 2007) For most variables sample n=2714 and weighted n=91,770. Record type variables, record use variables, and CAPEXP_TOTK have sample n=1,758 and weighted n=66,204.

The \"no\" outcome in the guaranteed FLP has a mean DTOTK of $6.4 thousand and FSADEBTTOTK has a mean of $272.9 thousand. The difference in the means was found to be significantly different from zero (p < 0.010. The weighted total of under-reported debt for the estimated 9,087 operators answering \"no\" over the four years of 2001, 2004, 2006 and 2007 is $2.422 billion or a simple average of $606 million per year. Almost $868 million dollars or $217 million per year more than what is under-reported in the direct FLP. However, the under-reported estimates of $1.554 billion from the direct FLP summary statistics and $2.442 billion from the guaranteed FLP summary statistics are not additive since 7.8 percent of the observations in the direct FLP summary statistics are also in the guaranteed FLP summary statistics. This is because the FSA debt variable includes both direct and guarantee indebtedness for those borrowers with loans from both programs. Again, the summary statistics show DTOTK and LCTOTK are the same amount which indicates DTOTK is only reflecting current liabilities for the respondents answering \"no\" on the ARMS survey. For those refusing to answer, it is surprising their FSADEBTTOTK mean is greater than the DTOTK mean by $37 thousand indicating an under-reporting of debt for an estimated total of $154 million, or a simple average of about $39 million per year. Although the difference is statistically insignificant, the under-reporting would only become greater as debts from other lenders are added. There is no statistical difference in the means of FSADEBTTOTK for those responding \"yes\", \"no\", and refusing to answer the owe money question of the ARMS survey. For the other independent variables in the Guaranteed FLP multinomial model, more than twice the share of borrowers responding \"no\" (0.19) have only OL LOC loans than those responding \"yes\" (0.09) or those refusing to respond (0.08). The average age for respondents ranges between 49-51 years of age with 49.5 years of age being the overall mean. The mean age for guaranteed FLP operators is 2.2 years lower than the mean age reported in the direct FLP summary statistics (p < 0.01). Overall, nearly half (47.5 percent) of the respondents have a high school or less education, which is just 2.5 percentage points lower than the percent of respondents in the direct FLP summary statistics. A greater share of respondents answering \"yes\" (0.23) has a college education than those answering \"no\" (0.14, p < 0.05) or refusing to answer the \"Owe Money\" question (0.0.14, p < 0.10). Overall, 10 percent of the respondents are SDA eligible which is half the percentage of respondents in the direct FLP model. Respondents answering \"no\" to the \"Owe Money\" question (0.05) have a smaller mean ratio of SDA eligible operators compared to those answering \"yes\" (0.11, p < 0.01) or refusing to answer (0.08), although the latter is insignificant. Additionally, respondents refusing to answer the \"Owe Money\" question have a lower mean ratio (0.03) of beginning farmer eligible operators compared to those answering \"yes\" (0.15, p < 0.01) or \"no\" (0.14, p < 0.05) and is similar to what was found in the direct FLP summary statistics. The summary statistics for RECORD_USE support the hypothesis since respondents answering \"yes\" to the \"Owe Money\" question have a mean ratio of 0.72 for RECORD_USE_MOT compared to a mean ratio of 0.40 and 0.31 for RECORD_USE_MOT for those answering \"no\" and for those refusing to answer. Operators answering \"no\" have a higher mean ratio for CROP_RATIO (0.72) than those answering \"yes\" (0.52) or refusing to answer (0.54). The summary statistics show respondents refusing to answer and those answering \"yes\" have a higher mean IGCFIK ($400 thousand and $364 thousand) than those responding \"no\" 50 ($243 thousand).

For the Direct FLP,66,998 out of 172,789 (38.8 percent) weighted operators have a DTOTK less than FSADEBTTOTK (Table 4.3). Also, those responding \"no\" have 21,970 out of 22,194 (99.0 percent) of weighted operators with DTOTK less than FSADEBTTOTK. Those responding \"yes\" have 39,523 out of 142,596 (27.7 percent) of weighted operators with DTOTK less than FSADEBTTOTK. Refusal respondents have 5,504 out of 7,993 (68.8 percent) of weighted operators with a DTOTK less than FSADEBTTOTK.

Also, those responding \"no\" have 8,958 out of 9,298 (96.4 percent) of weighted operators with DTOTK lower than FSADEBTTOTK. Those responding \"yes\" have 28,625 out of 84,579 (33.9 percent) of weighted operators with DTOTK lower than FSADEBTTOTK. Refusal respondents have 3,134 out of 5,298 (59.2 percent) of weighted operators with a DTOTK lower than FSADEBTTOTK. Both the Direct FLP and Guaranteed FLP show that operators responding \"no\" have a higher percentage that have DTOTK lower than FSADEBTTOTK followed by respondents refusing to answer. Operators responding \"yes\" have the smallest percentage with DTOTK less than FSADEBTTOTK. Those borrowers responding \"no\" are a definite problem area for ARMS estimation and accuracy. This result indicates that imputation for those respondents in the \"no\" outcome is difficult and needs improvement, although the difficulty of estimating total debt for many \"yes\" and \"refusal\" respondents is also apparent.  (2001, 2004, 2006, and 2007) SC_EDUC is significant (p < 0.05) and negative for the \"refusal\" outcome, and indicates operators with some college education are less likely to refuse to answer compared to operators with high school or less education. In the summary statistics, the \"refusal\" mean is statistically different from the \"yes\" mean (p < 0.01). Since SC_EDUC is a binary variable, this indicates that proportions of respondents with some college education are different for those refusing to answer the \"Owe Money\" question and for those responding \"yes.\" One plausible reason the some college coefficient is significant, but the CGB_EDUC is not, may be due to the fact that more education is synonymous with a more complex farming operation structure. More complexity in operation structure and finances may make reporting more difficult for respondents. The negative signs (p < 0.05) on both the OP_SDA_P and BF_ELIG \"refusal\" coefficients indicate SDA and beginning farmer eligible operators are less likely to refuse to answer the \"Owe Money\" question on the Farm Debt portion of the ARMS than operators not in these classes. It is likely women SDA comprise more of the OP_SDA_P observations than the race/ethnic SDA. According to the 2002 Census of Agriculture, women principal operators comprised 11.2 percent of the total farm operations while race/ethnic principal operators comprised 5.2 percent of the total farm operations (USDA, NASS, 2009b). In the 2007 Census of Agriculture, women principal operators comprised 13.9 percent of the total farm operations while race/ethnic principal operators comprised 6.6 percent of the total farm operations (USDA, NASS, 2009b). While sample size restrictions will not allow a breakdown by gender and race/ethnicity, it is likely that there are disparities in reporting debt by group. The 2002 Census of Agriculture indicated women principal operators were more likely to use computers for business and have internet access than male principal operators (USDA, NASS, 2005). Women operators may be better record keepers and may report more accurately than their male counterparts, and the current study's results support this assertion. The result for beginning farmer is expected because beginning farmers are required to participate in borrower training which may make them better at handling and understanding their finances and have financial records (USDA, FSA, 2015c). In the summary statistics, OP_SDA_P and BF_ELIG have \"refusal\" means significantly different from the \"yes\" means (p < 0.01). Since OP_SDA_P and BF_ELIG are binary variables, this indicates that the proportions of respondents that are either SDA or beginning farmers are different for those refusing to answer the \"Owe Money\" question and for those responding \"yes.\" CROP_RATIO is significant and positive for the \"no\" outcome (p < 0.05) and indicates respondents with more crop intense farms are more likely to respond \"no\" on the ARMS. Crop operations may have short term operating loans and may pay them off at the beginning of the year before the ARMS survey is administered in March and April. Both the \"no\" and \"refusal\" outcome coefficients are significant for IGCFIK. The negative sign on the \"no\" coefficient (p < 0.10) on IGCFIK means respondents with a lower gross cash farm income are more likely to say \"no.\" This is expected because the summary statistics showed respondent's answering \"no\" had smaller IGCFIK, ATOT, and ETOT. The positive sign on the \"refusal\" coefficient (p < 0.05) on IGCFIK implies respondents with a higher gross cash farm income are more likely to refuse to answer the \"Owe Money\" question on the Farm Debt section of the ARMS. As noted in the literature review, Weber and Clay (2013) found that the probability of entire survey nonresponse increases as farm size increases. Since IGCFIK is an indicator of farm size, these results are consistent with Weber and Clay's (2013) results. In regards to the Direct FLP binomial logistic model, the significant coefficients on the variables for \"refusal\" in the Direct FLP multinomial logistic model are not in the Direct FLP 57 binomial model because the refusal and yes categories are combined into a yes/refusal category. All variables with significant coefficients for the \"no\" outcome in the Direct FLP multinomial model have significant coefficients at similar significance levels, with the same signs, and similar magnitudes in the Direct FLP binomial model (Table 5.2). Moreover, all of the coefficients for the \"no\" outcomes have the same sign and similar magnitude for the two Direct FLP models. Considering the similarities between the Direct FLP multinomial model and Direct FLP binomial model, confidence in the \"no\" coefficient estimates in the Direct FLP multinomial model is boosted.  (2001, 2004, 2006, and 2007) Notes: Sample N= 2,696; Weighted N: 156,693; The \"yes\" and \"refusal\" outcomes are combined into one category and the \"no\" outcome is the other category."}, {"section_title": "Guaranteed FLP Multinomial Logistic Model Estimation Results", "text": "The estimated coefficients for the 30 independent variables in the Guaranteed FLP multinomial model are presented in Table 5.3. The \"no\" intercept coefficient is highly significant and negative (p < 0.01). The same result was found in the Direct FLP multinomial model. In the Direct FLP multinomial model, FSADEBTTOTK is highly significant (p < 0.01) and negative for the \"no\" outcome; however, FSADEBTTOTK is not significant for the \"no\" or \"refusal\" Guaranteed FLP multinomial model outcomes. Those answering \"no\" in the Direct FLP multinomial model have a smaller mean FSADEBTTOTK than those answering \"yes\" or refusing to answer. Whereas the Guaranteed FLP multinomial model FSADEBTTOTK means between \"yes\", \"refusal\", or \"no\" do not vary much. OL_LOC_GTE is marginally significant (p < 0.10), positive on the \"no\" outcome, and indicates respondents with only OL LOC loans are more likely to respond \"no\" on the \"Owe Money\" question on the Farm Debt section of the ARMS compared to respondents with only FO loans. This is expected because OL LOC loans are short term loans, and the respondent may not report the loan because they paid it off at the beginning of the year before the ARMS is administered in March and April. Moreover, OL LOC are short term loans and they may have a relatively small balance at the end of the year. The respondent may not remember or bother to report an OL LOC balance at the end the year because the operator does not consider the loan important enough to report. In the summary statistics, the \"no\" mean is significantly different from the \"yes\" mean (p < 0.05). Since OL_LOC_GTE is a binary variable, this indicates that proportions of respondents with OL line of credit loans are different for those refusing to answer the \"Owe Money\" question and for those responding \"yes.\" SC_EDUC is highly significant (p < 0.01), negative for the \"no\" outcome, and indicates operators with some college education are less likely to respond \"no\" compared to operators with high school or less education. The Guaranteed FLP multinomial model result is different from the Direct FLP multinomial model result because the significant Direct FLP multinomial model result is on the refusal outcome. OP_SDA_P is significant and negative for the \"no\" outcome (p < 0.05) which indicates SDA respondents are less likely to respond \"no\" to the \"Owe Money\" question. In the summary statistics, the \"no\" mean is significantly different from the \"yes\" mean (p < 0.01). Since OP_SDA_P is a binary variable, this indicates that proportions of SDA respondents are different for those refusing to answer the \"Owe Money\" question and for those responding \"yes.\" In the Direct FLP multinomial model, OP_SDA_P is significant for the refusal outcome. BF_ELIG is highly significant, negative for the \"refusal\" outcome (p < 0.01), and indicates beginning farmer respondents are less likely to refuse responding to the \"Owe Money\" question relative to answering \"yes\". The summary statistics show BF_ELIG's \"refusal\" mean is significantly different from the \"yes\" mean (p < 0.05). Since BF_ELIG is a binary variable, this indicates that proportions of beginning farmer respondents are different for those refusing to answer the \"Owe Money\" question and for those responding \"yes.\" The Direct FLP multinomial model had the same result except at a different significance level (p < 0.05). CROP_RATIO is highly significant and positive for the \"no\" outcome (p < 0.01) and indicates respondents with more crop intense farms are more likely to respond \"no\" on the ARMS. In the summary statistics, the \"no\" mean is statistically different from the \"yes\" mean (p < 0.01). Since CROP_RATIO is the share of the total value of production from crops, this indicates that the respondents that answer \"no\" to the \"Owe Money\" question have a significantly greater share of total value of production from crops on average than do those respondents that answer \"yes.\" The Direct FLP multinomial model has the same outcome except the significance level (p < 0.05). The negative sign on the \"no\" coefficient (p < 0.05) on IGCFIK means respondents with a lower gross cash farm income are more likely to say \"no.\" The summary statistics show IGCFIK's \"no\" mean is statistically different from the \"yes\" mean (p < 0.01). As stated in the previous section, the summary statistics showed respondents answering \"no\" had smaller IGCFIK, ATOTK, and ETOTK which is expected. The Direct FLP multinomial model has the same result except the significance level (p < 0.10). The \"no\" Y2004 and Y2007 variables are slightly significant and positive (p < 0.10) which indicates that survey years 2004 and 2007 respondents are more likely to respond \"no\" to the \"Owe Money\" question compared to survey year 2001 respondents. Between 2003 and 2012, a shorter version of the core survey was mailed out to operators, and the larger sampling size increased usable responses to 20,000 or more compared to 10,000 originally (USDA, ERS, 2015a). The Guaranteed FLP multinomial model results for survey years 2004 and 2007 could be influenced by the increased number of usable responses. Also, survey year 2007 was a census year and the ARMS is longer and appears different compared to non-census years. For instance, ARMS survey year 2007 only has four columns (five normally) for information in the Farm Debt section debt-by-lender table. The Farm Debt section debt-by-lender table is transposed and looks slightly different compared to 2001, 2004, and 2006. However, the Direct FLP multinomial model did not have any year coefficients significant. In regards to the Guaranteed FLP binomial logistic model, the significant coefficient on BF_ELIG for \"refusal\" in the Guaranteed FLP multinomial logistic model is not in the Guaranteed FLP binomial model because the refusal and yes categories were combined into a yes/refusal category. Otherwise, all variables (except Y2007) with significant coefficients for the \"no\" outcome in the Guaranteed FLP multinomial model had significant coefficients, same signs, and similar magnitudes as in the Guaranteed FLP binomial model (Table 5.4).  (2001, 2004, 2006, and 2007) Note: Sample N= 2,714; Weighted N= 91,771 The direct FLP offers emergency and economic emergency loans which allows farmers to obtain loans to help with drought, natural disaster, and economic stress. The guaranteed FLP offers operating line of credit loans, and the guaranteed FLP has much higher loan limits than the direct FLP. The guaranteed FLP may also have farm borrowers with slightly better financial characteristics than direct FLP borrowers since guaranteed loans originate with a commercial lender instead of with FSA, although the lender has required a guarantee. The Direct FLP and Guaranteed FLP multinomial models have only a few differences between them. Although both 64 have about the same number of significant coefficients (eight for the Direct FLP and nine for the Guaranteed FLP), the Direct FLP multinomial model had more significant coefficients on the \"refusal\" outcome and the Guaranteed FLP multinomial model had more on the \"no\" outcome."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 6: Conclusion", "text": "This chapter summarizes the conclusions to the current study, and offers suggestions for future research."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The study used FSA and ARMS data to determine the magnitude of respondent errors when answering farm debt questions in the ARMS. Multinomial logistic models were used to identify demographic, structural, and financial characteristics of FSA borrowers who accurately or inaccurately classify their farm operations as having end of year debt as well as those who refuse to indicate if they have end of year debt. Estimates of 12.9 percent of direct FLP operators and 9.9 percent of guaranteed FLP operators responded \"no\" to the \"Owe Money\" question on the Farm Debt section of the ARMS. Inaccurate reporting in the Farm Debt section of the ARMS could also mean that other sections are subject to inaccurate reporting as well. DTOT was also observed as being under-reported for an estimated 38.8 percent of direct FLP operators and 41.1 percent of guaranteed FLP operators. These percentages only consider FSA direct and guaranteed loan indebtedness and are likely much higher if non-FSA related loans are added. Furthermore, DTOT was under-reported the most when operators respond \"no\" to the \"Owe Money\" question in both the direct FLP (98.9 percent) and the guaranteed FLP (96.4 percent). Both the direct and guaranteed FLPs show DTOTK is under-reported for those answering \"no\" to the \"Owe Money\" question. From the direct FLP statistics, the weighted under-reporting estimate is nearly $1.554 billion for the \"no\" outcome. From the guaranteed FLP statistics, the weighted under-reporting estimate is $2.442 billion for the \"no\" outcome. The under-reporting estimates are for the entire four years of the study: 2001, 2004, 2006, and 2007. Those respondents answering \"no\" are a problematic source of under-reporting of debt in the debt section of the ARMS Phase III. The current study only looks at FSA debt, and the observed under-reporting could be far greater when other lenders, such as commercial banks and Farm Credit System, are added. The Direct and Guaranteed multinomial logistic models had the intercept, SC_EDUC, OL_SDA, BF_ELIG, CROP_RATIO, and IGCFI as significant coefficients in common. The Direct and Guaranteed multinomial logistic model results showed education, SDA and beginning farmer, and operation type and size as significant characteristics for determining when an operator responds \"no\" or refuses to respond. Operators with some college education were less likely to refuse in the Direct FLP multinomial logistic model relative to respondents with a high school or less education, and were less likely to respond \"no\" in the Guaranteed FLP multinomial logistic model. SDA operators were less likely to refuse in the Direct FLP and less likely to respond \"no\" in Guaranteed FLP multinomial logistic models. This means SDA operators and operators with some college education are more likely to have correctly reported debt. Beginning farmers were less likely to refuse in both the Direct and the Guaranteed FLP multinomial logistic models. As CROP_RATIO increased in both the Direct and Guaranteed FLP multinomial logistic models, the likelihood of responding \"no\" increased. As the intensity of value of crop production increases, the more likely farm debt is under-reported. As IGCFIK decreased, the likelihood of responding \"no\" increased in both the Direct and Guaranteed FLP multinomial logistic models, and this indicates the likelihood of under-reporting debt increases as gross cash farm income decreases. OL LOC loan operators were more likely to respond \"no\" in the Guaranteed FLP multinomial logistic model. Operators with an OL LOC loan are more likely to under-report their debt relative to operators with only guaranteed FO loans. Lastly, size as measured by gross cash farm income is important. Operators were less likely to respond \"no\" as IGCFIK increased in both the Direct and Guaranteed FLP models and more likely to refuse as IGCFIK increased in the Direct FLP model. Overall for the \"no\" outcome, Direct FLP multinomial model operators are more likely to under-report their debt in the ARMS Phase III if they either have a lower total FSA debt outstanding balance, have a greater value of crop production relative to total production, or have a lower gross cash farm income. Guaranteed FLP multinomial model operators are more likely to under-report their debt in the ARMS Phase III if they have only an OL LOC loan, have a greater share of production from crops, have a lower gross cash farm income, are in survey year 2004, or are in survey year 2007. They are less likely to under-report their debt if they either have some college education, are SDA eligible, or are beginning farmer eligible."}, {"section_title": "Future Research", "text": "Future research could build upon this study by constructing a triple hurdle model to determine if those who respond \"yes\" accurately indicate their lender and loan amount. The first hurdle would be constructed the same as the current study. The second hurdle would look at those who responded \"yes\" to the \"Owe Money\" question to see if they accurately listed their lender. FSA is the correct lender to list for the direct FLP loans. However the lender with an FSA guarantee is the correct lender to list for the guaranteed FLP loans since the loans are originated and serviced by the lender with the guarantee, such as a commercial bank. The third hurdle would look at those respondents accurately reporting their FSA loan to see if they accurately reported their outstanding loan balance. The first hurdle and the current study partially addressed measurement errors for the \"no\" respondents and non-response errors for the refusals. The last hurdle would consider measurement errors for the \"yes\" respondents in greater detail. Those 68 respondents who inaccurately list FSA as a lender is another type of measurement error that could be studied. The results presented here are only for operations with FSA direct and/or guaranteed loans. However, the analysis could be expanded to credit providers such as the Farm Credit System or commercial banks to get a better understanding of the full magnitude of debt underreporting. Additionally, research could be conducted in other sections of the ARMS survey to determine whether they are prone to inaccurate reporting as well. Also, future research could determine if current NASS imputation techniques have improved the estimation of DTOT from the ARMS Phase III, especially for those respondents indicating \"no\" on the \"Owe Money\" question in the Farm Debt section of the ARMS. Lastly, research could further look into reducing non-response by conducting experimental trials using different types of survey instruments to examine whether ARMS response can be improved. "}]
