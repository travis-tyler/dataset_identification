[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "As a foundation of US farm policy and primary risk management tool for US farms, Federal crop insurance (FCI) is a longstanding topic for both farm policy and farm sustainability debates. Federal crop insurance directly affects a farm's income and income variability, influencing nearly every farm decision, both financial and production-focused. These decisions, in turn, inherently impact the physical environment. How input use and other production practices change as an individual farm's crop insurance participation changes is an increasingly policy relevant question, given the consistent upward trend in enrollment and its near ubiquity for many crops. Questions on the environmental sustainability of crop insurance are complicated by the environmental impact of modern agriculture. Farmers may be affected by two kinds of moral hazard: the first, using insufficient inputs because crop insurance protects him/her from yield shocks, and second, using excessive inputs because the environmental externalities, especially runoff, are dispersed and rarely experienced locally. Nitrogen-based fertilizer is one fulcrum of that balancing act: its use is necessary to achieve high yields, while nitrogen (N) pollution and its negative impacts on air and water quality are already well documented (Carpenter et al., 1998). In particular, the hypoxic zone in the Gulf of Mexico, largely caused by N runoff from agricultural producers in the Mississippi River watershed, has received much attention from both the scientific literature as well as the popular press (Scavia et al., 2017). This paper makes a unique empirical contribution by first analyzing the degree of complementarity between a comprehensive group of production decisions, including input use rates. Data on these decisions come from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) Phase II, a fieldlevel survey that collects detailed data on production and conservation practices. ARMS Phase II data have never been used to study the relationship between crop insurance use and environmental sustainability. Based on these results, and on the early theoretical literature that also focuses on chemical fertilizers, we examine the relationship between crop insurance enrollment and nitrogen (N) balance, a yield-scaled measure of nitrogen fertilizer. N balance has received growing attention from the agronomic and environmental sciences literatures as an accessible and responsive measure of net N use at the field level. Because it is scaled for yield, N balance accounts for both production or profit objectives as well as potential environmental externalities, advancing empirical evaluations of the environmental impacts of increasing crop insurance uptake and coverage. Despite growing interest in using N balance to increase accountability and track progress towards reductions in N loss, especially in the EU, research on how N balance has changed over time, and which on-farm practices are related to optimal N balance, remains limited. Further, no large-scale study has connected N balance with changes in crop insurance participation and coverage."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Farmers make complex production and financial decisions based on their beliefs about uncertain and unknowable future states of the world. Farm management is inherently risky, with increasingly sophisticated tools available to manage that risk. The relationship between the risk that crop insurance addresses and the agronomic risk related to production practices is complex, even with-out consideration of environmental impact. For example, N fertilizers do not have a uniform, or even linear, effect on output, and much of their impact on yield depends on the specific state of nature (such as high precipitation) present when they are applied. The impact on the environment is similarly state dependent: timing of application matters almost as much as the rate. The question of whether certain inputs, including N, are risk decreasing or increasing complicates theoretical models of how crop insurance alters production decisions and the subsequent environmental impact. Horowitz and Lichtenberg (1993) outline a theoretical model of crop insurance and moral hazard that underlies, explicitly or implicitly, this debate. In their model, farm operators using insurance are incentivized to increase use of chemical inputs that increase yield variability across all states of nature, and therefore increase risk. In their empirical analysis of farm survey data, they find a positive association between a farmer's likelihood of insurance use and chemical input expenditure; the author interprets this as evidence of moral hazard. From a sustainability perspective, there would be a negative externality from this relationship as well: an increase in the amount of chemicals used increases runoff into waterways and N lost into the air. Among others, Babcock and Hennessy (1996) come to the opposite conclusion of Horowitz and Lichtenberg (1993). Based on their underlying assumptions, Babcock and Hennessy (1996) find that use of both chemical fertilizers and pesticides should decrease in the presence of insurance that protects against low yields. In their theoretical model, nitrogen fertilizer use declines with crop insurance participation, as additional applications serve to reduce yield risk in the event of excess rainfall. The a priori relationship between crop insurance, agricultural production decisions, and environmental outcomes remains, therefore, an open empirical question, especially given the methodological challenges faced by previous studies. The empirical literature is hampered by a lack of access to appropriate farm-level data. Most previous work has used county-level data (Schoengold et al. (2014), Claassen et al. (2011), Goodwin et al. (2004), Goodwin and Smith (2003)), or a single year of farm level data (Chang and Mishra (2012), Wu (1999), Smith and Goodwin (1996), Horowitz and Lichtenberg (1993)). Studies using county-level data are unlikely to have precise results or provide insights on farm-level decision making, because of (1) unobserved farm-level characteristics that influence both crop insurance and production decisions and (2) aggregation of farm-level data. To the best of our knowledge, only Weber et al. (2016) have used farm-level data, an unbalanced panel from ARMS Phase III, to address this issue. One consequence of using county-level or inadequate farm-level data is that measures of insurance participation are quite coarse, with no standard in the literature. Participation can be measured as a binary variable, with a value of 1 indicating any level of enrollment: this is the most common measure used in previous literature, even with farm-level data (Walters et al. (2012), Wu (1999), Smith and Goodwin (1996)). As insurance participation increases nationwide, however, the amount of variation this measure provides may no longer be sufficient for identifying effects precisely. Fortunately, there is variation in the extent to which an individual farmer uses crop insurance, through the coverage level and the number of acres enrolled."}, {"section_title": "Conceptual model", "text": "The importance of nitrogen fertilizer has prompted the development of yield-scaled indicators of reduction in the amount of N lost from agricultural production. One such indicator is the N balance, defined as the difference between the N added to an agricultural system as fertilizer and the amount of N absorbed into the crops. Using both data from field-level studies as well as a simulation model, McLellan et al. (2018) find that N balance is a \"robust predictor\" of the field-level amount of N lost into the environment, and that this relationship is consistent when aggregated spatially up to the watershed level and temporally across years. Their model simulations use the Adapt-N program, which is capable of deconstructing field-level N loss into the different forms of N, gaseous and solid. Using these breakdowns, the authors are able to conclude that the relationship between N balance and N loss is consistent for both kinds of major N loss: gaseous losses, such as of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and physical leaching of nitrate (NO 3 ) and amonia (NH 3 ). This consistent response across different kinds of N ameliorate concerns about measurement contaminated by pollution reduction trade-offs, where, for example, practices that reduce one kind of N loss increase another. In addition to representing the potential N lost from agricultural production at the field, farm, or even watershed level, N balance can be used to set thresholds and aid in pollution reduction targeting efforts that can be implemented at these levels. Producers, in theory, could be incentivized to meet these thresholds, which tend to be credible as N balance is responsive to individual farmer decisions. The concept of the \"safe operating space,\" developed by the European Union Nitrogen Expert Panel (EU-NEP), is one such threshold (Panel, 2015). The safe operating space is designed to accommodate both production and environmental goals: it is defined by a minimum acceptable yield level to ensure that production levels are being maintained and by a range of acceptable N balance levels. N balances that are too low indicate risk of soil mining, while N balance values that are too high indicate inefficient use of chemical resources and increase the risk for potential leaching (See Figure 1). The safe operating space can also represent the early theoretical debate on the relationship between crop insurance and chemical input use. Horowitz and Lichtenberg (1993) argue that farmers with crop insurance increase their use of chemical inputs, which implicitly suggests they they are more likely to produce in the region where N use efficiency is too low. On the other hand, Babcock and Hennessy (1996) argues that operations with crop insurance are more likely to reduce their use of chemical inputs; which suggests moving towards the region of the graph where N use efficiency is too high and insufficient N is being applied. In this paper, we set out to determine whether operator's response to crop insurance, or to increased coverage with crop insurance, is somewhere in the middle of these two potential production responses."}, {"section_title": "Data and empirical strategy", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The foundation of our ability to examine the production and chemical use decisions of farmers while observing their level and use of crop insurance is high-quality farm-level data. Farm-level data is ideal for research on the environmental impacts of farm policy, as each farm operator makes decisions about crop insurance, crop acreage, and production expenses and practices individually, while environmental externalities are often observed in aggregate. We use the most comprehensive national farm-level data available for the United States: the ARMS (Agricultural Resource Management Survey) Phase II and Phase III data for major field crops. ARMS is a nationwide, representative farm survey that is conducted annually by the USDA. Farm or field-level ARMS data is made available to university researchers through special agreements with the USDA-Economic Research Service (ERS). ARMS Phase III is an annual survey of approximately 20,000 farms that covers production, finances and farm operator and household characteristics. While Phase III collects only limited production practices data, in some years additional farms are sampled to take part in the commodity-specific ARMS Phase II survey. A different subset of commodities is sampled every year. For this study, we have focused on corn, available for the years 1996-2001, 2005, 2010, and 2016. ARMS Phase II allows researchers to more systematically consider aggregate environmental impacts of different production practices. The survey has detailed, field-level data on various production and conservation practices, as well as expenditure on and quantities of various inputs. Table 1 contains a list of the practices that are measured with indicator variables in ARMS Phase II and that we include in our subsequent analysis. Summary statistics for these practices are available in Appendix A, table A1. Table A2 includes similar summary statistics for practices measured with an indicator variable and specifically related to pest management. The relationship between these field-level practices listed above and yield is complicated. Yields vary widely based not only on the production practices chosen but also on location, planting date, and other farmer decisions. While we see many of these variables in the ARMS data set, it is difficult to summarize the relationship between a particular practice, especially one measured as binary. The primary extenuating and unobserved factors complicating estimation are soil quality and other field-level conditions, including weather. Nonetheless, it is possible to compare yields across fields that have and no not have these practices. This information is presented in table A3. Although yields tend to be higher from fields without many of these practices, these summary statistics do not control for location or other on-farm observable factors. Regression results that do control for such factors show, over time, no consistent relationship (positive or negative) between any of the practices listed in this table and yield. In addition to the variety of field-level practices described above, the Phase II survey also elicits detailed information on the use of chemical inputs at the application level. For each application of both fertilizer and pesticide, the survey collects information on the quantity, content, timing, rate, and method of application. Summary statistics for the quantities that are measured continuously and included in our analysis, by crop insurance coverage, are in Table 2. These data can be aggregated up to the field level and connected to the Phase II data, and then, using provided weights, aggregated up further to the operation level and connected to the data on farm financial characteristics in Phase III. These data were also used to calculate the amount of nitrogen applied at the field level, and, using field-level information on yield, used to calculate the field's N balance. Using recommendations from both Panel (2015) and Zhao et al. (2016), a safe operating space for corn production was developed so that farms could be categorized by whether or not their N use puts them into this safe operating space. An operation was considered in the safe operating space if their yield per acre was at least equal to the three year average of state-level yield per acre reported by NASS, and if their nitrogen balance equivalent was between the threshold of the \"safe planetary boundary for N\" defined by Zhang et al. (2015) of 34.8 to 69.6 lbs/acre/year (or 39-78 kg/ha/year). These parameters are necessarily restrictive, and could be relaxed or altered as knowledge of particular thresholds at the watershed or state level grows. Through ARMS Phase III, we have information on crop insurance premiums paid and, for some years, information on actual crop insurance coverage level and insurance program type (i.e., yield or revenue). We are able to use a combination of measures of crop insurance participation in our analysis: participation indicators, expenditure on premiums, actual coverage levels, and product choice. Using these measures, we are able to use the variation in intensity of crop insurance use, as well as the increasingly ubiquitous decision to use crop insurance or not, to examine the impact of increasing coverage on input use and, through use of the N balance metric, explore how farmers with increasing coverage use nitrogen fertilizer on their fields. Premiums paid are a measure of crop insurance expenditure that reflects crop insurance coverage levels, as well as other factors, such as the value of the crop being insured and historic yields (APH or average production history). A higher level of crop insurance premiums will generally correspond to higher coverage levels, or a larger share of production that is protected from yield or revenue loss. Summary statistics for these crop insurance measures, as well as for field-level yields, are presented below in Table 3.  (1996,2001,2005,2010,2016) **From Phase II survey (1996,2000,2001,2005,2010,2016) 4.2 Methods"}, {"section_title": "CART", "text": "Given the array of diverse production practices available to us through ARMS Phase II, the starting point for our analysis on the impacts of FCI on sustainable production practices and N balance is a classification and regression tree (CART) analysis of the production practices. CART, a data reduction and classification technique, takes the full data set and splits it into relatively more homogeneous groups. The tolerance for splitting, and the minimum of the final group size, are set by the researcher, while the CART algorithm estimates first which variables (which practices, in this case) have the most explanatory and predictive power for the variation of the outcome in question and then at what level the variable should be split. The output of the CART analysis is a tree diagram, indicating, in order of importance, which practices have the most explanatory power. In this case, CART analysis was used to identify which of the practices x 1t , x 2t , x 3t ...x nt described above and summarized in tables 1 and 2 had the most power for predicting our outcomes of interest Y i t with i = 1, 2 and in year t. Outcome Y 1t was defined to be field-level crop insurance coverage, an indicator variable for which a value of 1 indicated the field was covered by crop insurance and 0 indicating it was not. This analysis provides an understanding of which practices, and combinations of practices, explain most of the variance in crop insurance participation across the years covered in our survey. The second outcome Y 2t is an indicator of whether the operation is in the safe operating space for N usage. As described above, ARMS Phase II data is used to calculate N balance for the field. This analysis continues the work of Dalgaard et al. (2014) and Blesh and Drinkwater (2013) of identifying which farm management practices, jointly and individually, contribute to optimizing N balance. All of the practices x 1t , x 2t , x 3t ...x nt used for predicting FCI coverage are used here, except for quantity of nitrogen applied, which, naturally, has overwhelming predictive power for N balance. Next, we connect these two separate analyses with specifications that examine how extensive and intensive changes in crop insurance are associated with changes in an operation's likelihood of being in the safe operating space, as well as the distance an operation is from the optimal N balance inside that space.\nThe results predicting whether an operation is in the safe operating space for N use show the importance of other chemical inputs in addition to active management practices. Operations with higher rates of P usage are more likely to be in the N safe operating space, indicating that there may be trade-offs between use of different chemicals. One limitation of this research is that we are unable to observe field-level soil characteristics, which could help explain why operations use one type of fertilizer over another. For example, lime quantity per acre, the practice with the second most explanatory power in this analysis, typically increases with soil acidity. However, it has also been shown to increase plant uptake of all three major nutrients (N, P, K), which could help explain its predictive and explanatory power for the N balance of operations in our study (West and McBride, 2005). Supporting the idea of active and engaged management practices leading to more responsible use of N, the practice with the third most explanatory power in the CART analysis is whether or not the field had a nitrogen soil test. Tested fields were more likely to have an N balance in the safe operating space than those that did not, belying the importance of these tests towards informing application of fertilizer at a responsible rate, and only when needed to support desired levels of production. Together, these first three variables have almost 90% of the predictive and explanatory power for an operation's N balance safe operating space."}, {"section_title": "Empirical estimation", "text": "In addition to CART analysis, we rely on standard econometric estimation to explain the likelihood of an operation's N balance being in the safe operating space. Here, we use both an indicator of the safe operating space and the calculated absolute value of the distance from the operation's N balance to the optimal N balance. 1 We are able to examine the changes in these outcomes associated with both having crop insurance, and also with increasing coverage rates. In addition, thanks to unique data on product type, we are able to examine the change in N balance across different insurance products, providing additional insight into the kind of insurance products that are associated with movement towards the optimal N balance. Crop insurance coverage is measured in three ways: first, an indicator of whether the field was covered by crop insurance, information solicited from the Phase II survey; second, an indicator of whether the operation purchased crop insurance, from the Phase III survey; and finally, if the operation purchased crop insurance, the amount paid by the operator for the insurance product. Premium paid is an approximation of the coverage level. Our main results are estimated using OLS and the following specification: where Y it is the difference between the operation i's N balance and the optimal N balance in year t ; FCI it is an operation's FCI, measured either as an indicator variable or as the premium paid; X it is a vector of farm production practices, both indicators and continuous quantities, as well as select farm characteristics, including operator's age, acres operated, and value of production. The estimation also includes state (s s ) and year (r t ) fixed effects. In addition to the main specification above, equation 1 is also estimated as a logit model, with an indicator for safe operating space as the outcome (see Appendix B, table B4). The main specification is also run with the year-by-year impact of crop insurance, in order to understand how the dynamics of the relationship between FCI and N balance evolve over time, as follows: 1996,2000,2001,2005,2010,2016 with the variables defined as before, except for FCI i , which is defined only as an indicator of the operation having crop insurance, rather than the continuous measure of coverage. The final specification uses data on the kind of crop insurance product. Changes in survey design mean that these questions were only asked of farmers in 2016, and so the data is cross-sectional rather than time series. where the variables are defined as before, and k indexes the 7 types of FCI insurance product (including no insurance) that covered field f in 2016. Farmers were also asked to report their actual coverage level, depending on their product, in 2016. Results of a specification where equation 1is run with FCI it equal to actual coverage level appear in Appendix B, table B5. Table 4 shows the results of the CART analysis: the practices with the greatest explanatory power for participation in crop insurance (1) and production in the N balance safe operating space (2) are shown, ranked in order of importance. These results summarize the CART analysis done over all of the years for which data were available; year-by-year CART analysis was also performed and those results are available on request. 2 The CART results predicting FCI coverage at the field level indicate that farmers whose fields are covered by crop insurance are more likely to undertake activities that reflect active, engaged management of their fields. The non-input practice with the most explanatory and predictive power, scouting for weeds, is especially indicative of this. Fields that were scouted for weeds were more likely to also be covered by crop insurance. Although the impact on either yield or the environment of this practice is likely to be lower than many of the other practices examined using CART, operators who scout for weeds are, at a minimum, being attentive to the overall state of their corn fields. In addition, they are less likely than the operators who are not scouting to make blanket applications of pesticides, regardless of their necessity. The other variables with explanatory power for crop insurance are all chemical inputs associated with intensive row crop production. Together, these variables (scouting for weeds, N pounds per acre, pounds of pesticide per acre, and K pounds per acre) explain more than 80% of the variation in crop insurance coverage. Although higher rates of the application of all of these are more likely to be found on fields with crop insurance, normative statements about whether these rates are \"too high\" cannot be made using this CART analysis alone. In the following section, the analysis using N balance outcomes are better equipped to determine if farmers with crop insurance are using N in a more responsible way than their insurance-less counterparts."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "FCI and N balance", "text": "The results from our main specification, described in equation 1, are found in table 5. Here, the outcome of interest is how far an operation's N balance is from the optimal N inside the safe operating space. We find a consistent relationship between nearness to the optimal N and FCI coverage, measured three different ways. The strongest measure of field-level coverage is an indicator variable indicating that the field surveyed in Phase II is itself covered by crop insurance; this is associated with a decrease in the distance to optimal N of about 32 lbs/acre. The marginal impact of crop insurance on this difference is greater than the marginal impact of any of the continuously measured input variables. The relationship is smaller in magnitude but remains consistently statistically significant when we use operation-level crop insurance coverage, a weaker measure of coverage at the field level. Operation coverage is associated with an operation being 24 lbs/acre closer to the optimal N. The final specification uses a continuous measure of coverage with the proxy of premium paid. An additional dollar in premium paid by the operator for crop insurance is associated with a 1.25 lb/acre move towards the optimal N. This intensive measure of crop insurance coverage exploits more variation across farmers, especially in the later years represented in our sample. By 2016, the last year for which we have data, crop insurance coverage for conventional corn was nearly universal. Premiums paid, however, were still likely to vary greatly across farmers, depending on the particular product purchased, the coverage level, and the location of the operation. The growing ubiquity of crop insurance is reflected in our year-by-year results of the relationship between coverage and distance to the optimal N level, available in table 6. The magnitude of the relationship declines consistently through the years, especially for operation-level coverage. In 1996, when crop insurance was much less widely used and the insurance products and programs differed greatly from their modern implementation, operation-level coverage was associated with a decreased distance to optimal N of 200 lbs/acre. Two decades later, in 2016, the role of crop insurance in this relationship was half that, at about 100 lbs/acre. Nonetheless, the relationship is strong: operations with crop insurance are more likely to be producing corn with their N balance closer to the optimal N as defined by the N balance and safe operating space. This decline in the strength of the relationship is less consistent, but still present, for the field-level coverage. Although the association is significant in 1996, that is no longer the case in 2016. This declining role of crop insurance in determining optimal N use could be attributed to the almost universal use of crop insurance, as well as increasing intensity of use in terms of coverage level and program sophistication.  3and use only data from 2016, the most recent year in our sample. In 2016, farmers who completed the Phase II survey were asked to report the kind of crop insurance product they used to cover that particular field. The relationship between each program on distance to ideal N, relative to the omitted category of no insurance, is consistently negative, with the exception of fields with federal CAT coverage. Catastrophic crop insurance, commonly referred to as CAT coverage, is considered the \"basic level of coverage\" and was initially mandatory for farmers wishing to receive deficiency payments. Because farmers paid no premium for it, operations covered by it can be thought of as minimally covered Glauber (2013). As the sophistication and coverage protections of the programs increase, so does the strength of the relationship with distance to ideal N. Farms with revenue protection, for example, are 82 lbs/acre closer to the ideal N than are farms with no insurance. Purchase of the supplemental coverage option (SCO) for revenue insurance reduces the distance to the ideal N by almost 20 lbs/acre over revenue protection without SCO. Although the characterization of different programs as more sophisticated is complicated, especially without more specific information about the chosen program parameters, there is strong evidence in these results that programs beyond the minimum levels of coverage are associated with a higher likelihood of operators producing in the safe operating N balance space. Further, this conclusion is supported by the analysis done with the actual coverage level, reported in Appendix B, table B5. Especially for the revenue insurance program, as the coverage level increases, the distance to the safe operating space decreases. The results using program type and coverage level together point to an explanation that as farm operators are more protected from financial setbacks caused by loss of crop revenue, they are more likely to apply their chemical inputs at a rate which is environmentally responsible. "}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This analysis is among the first to connect a farm's production practices and risk management decisions, providing empirical support for an ongoing debate in the agricultural economics literature about the direction and nature of the moral hazard problems associated with crop insurance. Advances in the ecological and environmental sciences' understanding of crop systems has led to creation of metrics of sustainability which, perhaps unknowingly, greatly enhance this debate. The N balance measure acknowledges that there are production and environmental risks at both tails of the distribution of N use. Environmentally responsible management of chemical inputs avoids over-applying, and thus eating into their own profits while simultaneously creating excess stocks of N ready to leach into the groundwater, as well as under-applying, impacting yields while also potentially mining N from the soil and its organic matter. The balance of these two potential outcomes provides the ideal conceptual framework for exploring how Federal crop insurance impacts chemical use decisions, along with a suite of other production practices likely to impact the sustainability of US agriculture. We find that not only is protecting farmers from the risk of lost revenue using crop insurance strongly related to at least one measure of responsible N use, this relationship increases in magnitude as the strength of the protections and levels of coverage increase. The majority of corn production is now covered by crop insurance and increasing coverage is related to farm operators having a more optimal N balance. The relationship of various measures of FCI use with N balance is more influential than the impact of other chemical inputs, and of most production practices. This implies that what is considered sustainable production in this case may simply be the natural outcome of profit maximizing farmer who is risk adverse, but shielded from the worst of financial consequences through risk management mechanisms like crop insurance. 7 Appendix A: Summary statistics    "}]
