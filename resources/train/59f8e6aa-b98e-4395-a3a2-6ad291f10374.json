[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Motor slowing is associated with risk of Alzheimer's disease. Whether \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) burden is associated with motor decline, independent of cognitive decline, is unknown. Methods: About 59 cognitively unimpaired older participants had baseline PET-PiB scans and repeated measures of lower (usual gait speed, 400-m time, Health ABC Physical Performance Battery (HABCPPB) score, total standing balance time) and upper (mean tapping time) extremity performance during a mean follow-up of 4.7 years. Linear mixed effect models examined the relationship between baseline A\u03b2 burden and motor decline, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, cardiovascular risk, APOE \u025b4 status, memory decline, depressive symptoms, ankle-arm index, processing speed, executive function, and cerebrovascular disease. Results: Higher mean cortical A\u03b2 burden was associated with greater declines in gait speed and HABCPPB score and a greater increase in 400-m time. Higher A\u03b2 of putamen was associated with declines in all lower extremity measures, including balance. Higher A\u03b2 of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and lateral temporal lobe was associated with declines of gait speed and 400-m time, and of precuneus with a greater increase in 400-m time. Associations remained similar after further adjustment. Conclusions: In cognitively unimpaired older adults, A\u03b2 burden overall and in specific brain regions are risk factors for lower extremity motor decline, independent of memory function. These findings provide the first empirical evidence that A\u03b2 burden is a risk factor for mobility decline in older adults."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Age-related declines in mobility and motor function contribute to late-life disability and have many causes, including cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal, and neurological impairments (1, 2) . Other than neurological diagnoses such as stroke and Parkinson's disease, neurological contributors to age-related motor decline are not well established. Periventricular white matter lesions and gray matter atrophy, particularly in prefrontal and temporal areas, appear to lead to poor mobility (3, 4) . Although emerging evidence suggests that small vessel ischemic brain disease affects motor performance, \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) burden might also play an independent role in agerelated motor decline.\nA\u03b2 deposition is closely associated with subsequent Alzheimer's disease (AD), and motor slowing appears to precede the onset of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (5) . A\u03b2 deposition is known to occur in older persons without cognitive impairment; about 40% of older adults in their 70s known to be without dementia have detectable brain A\u03b2 deposition (6) . Compared to controls, individuals who subsequently developed MCI show accelerated motor slowing as early as 12 years prior to the diagnosis (7) . With motor decline appearing to develop prior to cognitive decline, and with the known accumulation of A\u03b2 years prior to the development of dementia, the question arises, \"Does A\u03b2 accumulation predict motor decline in addition to, and independent of cognitive decline and dementia?\" A relationship between global and regional A\u03b2 burden with motor slowing may help explain the observed early motor signs in cognitive decline and AD. In addition, A\u03b2 accumulation could be a potentially modifiable contributor to age-related motor slowing and mobility disability.\nThere is limited evidence about the relationship between A\u03b2 deposition and motor function. To date, a single cross-sectional study in older adults who had memory complaints suggested that higher amyloid burden was associated with slower gait (8) . It remains unclear whether the amyloid burden develops before motor slowing, whether motor slowing is evident beyond gait alone, or whether the relationship is independent of cognitive impairment or vascular risk.\nThe current study followed older adults over time with extensive assessments of cognition and movement to evaluate whether mean cortical and regional fibrillary A\u03b2 burden is associated with longitudinal change in lower and upper extremity motor function. It assesses whether the effects are independent of vascular risk and memory decline. We predicted that higher baseline cortical A\u03b2 burden was associated with greater motor decline, and the relationship localized to motor planning-related regions."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Population", "text": "Participants were drawn from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging neuroimaging (BLSA-NI) substudy (9) .

Each motor measure served as a separate dependent variable. The linearity assumption was confirmed because the quadratic interval term (ie, number of years between baseline and each follow-up visit) was not significant for all motor measures (p > .05). DVR, interval, and DVR \u00d7 interval were modeled as fixed effects. The intercept and interval were allowed to vary between individuals and modeled as random effects. For lower extremity motor function, models first adjusted for baseline age, sex, and body mass index, and for upper extremity function adjusted for baseline age and sex as fixed effects. Baseline age was centered to the mean. DVR values were centered to the mean and multiplied by 10 for interpretation purposes.\nTo examine whether cardiovascular risk, APOE \u03b54 status, memory, depressive symptoms, peripheral arterial disease, processing speed, executive function, or cerebrovascular disease would affect the relationship, models further adjusted for each. Models adjusted for baseline cardiovascular risk score, APOE \u03b54 status, ankle-arm index, DSST, TMT-B, and WMH/ICV, while models adjusted for repeated measures of CVLT and CES-D. Covariates and their interactions with interval were fixed effects. Analyses were repeated by excluding five with a baseline CDR of 0.5.

To evaluate the influence of interval, we stratified the analyses in those aged less than 80 years who had evaluations every 2 years (n = 40) and those aged 80 and older (n = 19) who had evaluations annually. Effects persisted for the younger strata, but sample size was too small to evaluate the older strata (not shown). For cDVR associations, significance was reported at p < .05.

Further adjustment did not change the cross-sectional associations (Table 2 , Models 3-5). Longitudinally, higher cDVR was associated with greater declines in gait speed and HABCPPB score and with a greater increase in 400-m time (Figure 1 ), and not with change in balance time ( Table 2 , Model 1).

"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Among cognitively unimpaired older adults, total and regional A\u03b2 burden predicted decline in multiple aspects of lower extremity performance. Results were robust with adjustment for cardiovascular risk or APOE \u03b54 status and were independent of memory decline. Decline in lower extremity performance over time was associated with A\u03b2 burden localized to early deposition regions important for motor planning, such as the putamen, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, lateral temporal lobe, and precuneus, but not in regions of later deposition, such as the primary motor cortex or hippocampus. Our findings show for the first time that amyloid deposition may affect the rate of decline in mobility in older adults who do not meet criteria for cognitive impairment.\nOur findings regarding A\u03b2 burden in the putamen are consistent with previous cross-sectional results showing the significant association of A\u03b2 burden in the putamen, but not caudate, with slower gait (8) . We also did not find significant associations in the caudate, despite evidence of caudate amyloid deposition. This is difficult to explain because the caudate plays important roles in cognitive and motor function, including spatial navigation and goal-directed activity (19) . The motor tasks we tested may not have been sensitive to complex motor functions. We did not find strong associations of A\u03b2 in the primary motor cortex or hippocampus. Studies in healthy older adults may not be able to detect effects in these regions where there is little early A\u03b2 deposition and low interindividual variation.\nWe did not find a cross-sectional association between A\u03b2 burden and gait speed, although we observed unadjusted cross-sectional associations with HABCPPB score and balance time. The recent cross-sectional study found an association between A\u03b2 burden and gait speed in an older population, in whom 99% had memory complaints (8) . In contrast, our study population was healthier, free of cognitive and mobility impairment, and walked faster at baseline. Thus, the relative homogeneity of our sample at baseline may limit our ability to detect cross-sectional effects. Because lower extremity motor function is affected by many factors, including cardiovascular and musculoskeletal deficits, the cross-sectional association between A\u03b2 burden and gait may be confounded by individual differences in these other factors. Contrary to the multiple significant associations with lower extremity motor decline, we did not find any associations with finger tapping. Perhaps these upper extremity tasks reflect speed of movement more purely and did not require the kind of motor planning and integration that was demanded by our lower extremity tasks. Alternatively, our upper extremity tasks may not be very demanding because we also did not find an expected effect of aging over time. This study has several strengths. Our cohort was followed longitudinally with multiple measures of physical performance repeated over time, allowing us to test whether A\u03b2 burden is followed by performance declines. All BLSA participants are evaluated with respect to MCI and dementia, allowing us to exclude participants with cognitive impairment. Our findings remained robust despite the challenges of a Bonferroni correction and adjustment for covariates, including cardiovascular risk score and APOE \u03b54 status. The associations remained after adjustment for memory decline, suggesting that motor decline may be independent of memory decline with age. We explored the spatial distribution of A\u03b2 burden in relation to motor changes. The pattern of involved regions generally supports a model of adverse effects of localized amyloid burden on motor planning and sensorimotor integration.\nThis study has limitations. Our study sample was in good health with very good physical function at enrollment into the BLSA-NI substudy, potentially limiting generalizability. Although our sample size could be considered modest for a longitudinal study, it is quite sizable for a PET study that includes longitudinal follow-up of both multiple aspects of motor function and careful assessment of cognition. Although age-stratified results are difficult to interpret due to the small sample size in the older age stratum, most of longitudinal associations persisted in the younger age stratum which was somewhat larger. Future studies or multisite collaborations could overcome these limitations. We selected brain regions of interest a priori, based on known relationships with motor planning and integration. By ignoring other regions, we might have missed potentially important associations that were not expected given current knowledge. In this exploratory analysis, a Bonferroni correction is conservative. We did not adjust for brain atrophy. Future studies in larger samples with longitudinal assessment of amyloid burden, brain atrophy, and gait could investigate the contribution of brain atrophy to the relationship between amyloid burden and gait decline.\nEarly amyloid deposition in motor planning-related brain regions might play a key role in age-related decline in physical performance and mobility. These findings may help to explain why motor changes seem to precede the cognitive changes that can lead to cognitive impairment and AD. Because cognitive and mobility-related deficits are major contributors to late-life disability, early detection of amyloid burden may provide a novel strategy to prevent or delay these twin evils of aging."}, {"section_title": "Supplementary Material", "text": "Supplementary material can be found at: http://biomedgerontology. oxfordjournals.org/"}, {"section_title": "Funding", "text": "This research was supported in part by the Intramural Research Program of the NIA (03-AG-0325)."}]
