In addition, different partial volume correction (PVC) methods are applied and evaluated.\nMethods: We evaluated magnetic resonance imaging and 18 F-AV-45 positron emission tomography data from 122 cognitively normal (CN) patients recruited at the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Cortex SUVRs were obtained by using the cerebellar grey matter (CGM) (SUVR CGM ) and the whole cerebellum (SUVR WC ) as reference regions. The correlations between the different SUVRs and the WM uptake (WM-SUVR CGM ) were studied in patients, and in a well-controlled framework based on Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. Activity maps for the MC simulation were derived from ADNI patients by using a voxel-wise iterative process (BrainViset). Ten WM uptakes covering the spectrum of WM values obtained from patient data were simulated for different patients. Three different PVC methods were tested (a) the regional voxel-based (RBV), (b) the iterative Yang (iY), and (c) a simplified analytical correction derived from our MC simulation.\nResults: WM-SUVR CGM followed a normal distribution with an average of 1.79 and a standard deviation of 0.243 (13.6%). SUVR CGM was linearly correlated to WM-SUVR CGM (r = 0.82, linear fit slope = 0.28). SUVR WC was linearly correlated to WM-SUVR CGM (r = 0.64, linear fit slope = 0.13). Our MC results showed that these correlations are compatible with those produced by isolated spill-in effect (slopes of 0.23 and 0.11). The impact of the spill-in was mitigated by using PVC for SUVR CGM (slopes of 0.06 and 0.07 for iY and RBV), while SUVR WC showed a negative correlation with SUVR CGM after PVC. The proposed analytical correction also reduced the observed correlations when applied to patient data (r = 0.27 for SUVR CGM , r = 0.18 for SUVR WC )."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "structured myelin basic proteins [20] and as such, related to age-associated demyelination. Furthermore, recent studies have suggested that WM uptake might be more relevant to the evolution of the disease than previously expected [19] , with WM uptake increasing with age and with disease progression.\nThus, the good performance of these alternative reference regions including WM remains an interesting field of exploration. An important fact to take into account when discussing A\u03b2 PET quantification is that it can be further hardened by the limitations of PET imaging [7] . One of the most relevant problems regarding A\u03b2 PET images is the partial volume effect (PVE), defined as the spill-over of counts between different image regions due to the limited spatial resolution of the PET images [21] . The PVE is often regarded as two separate effects: the counts that go from the target region to adjacent regions (spill-out) and the counts that go from these adjacent regions into the target region (spill-in). These PVEs are proportional to the differences in uptake between the target and the adjacent region (contrast), being more prominent from hot to cold regions [22] , and to the size of the regions, as, in relative terms, small regions are more sensitive to PVE than larger regions [23] . Thus, two different effects must be considered in the estimation of SUVR from A\u03b2 PET images. First, the spill-out activity from the GM to the WM and CSF due to cortical thickness and its variations due to atrophy in longitudinal studies. This effect has been broadly studied, concluding that different PVE corrections (PVC) provide more consistent longitudinal results [24, 25] . Second, the spill-in activity from the WM into the GM, which might be especially relevant for studies where primarily amyloid-negative patients are used, such as in the calculation of SUVR thresholds. In a recent study [26] , a visual inspection of SUVR borderline false-positive cases was related to high radiotracer retention in WM. In addition, other publications [27] reported a correlation between white and gray matter uptake in 11 C-Pittsburgh compound B ( 11 C-PIB) in cognitively normal (CN) patients, and how this correlation disappeared after applying PVC. Spill-in in A\u03b2-negative patients have also been evaluated focusing on its effect on kinetic parameters, demonstrating a significant bias of the non-specific binding components in GM due to WM spill-in both in 18 F-based and 11 C-based tracers [28, 29] . These latter findings could explain why reference regions containing WM seem to be more robust, as the inclusion of WM counts into the reference region could partially compensate for this effect.\nIn this work, we aim to provide a systematic study of the impact of WM spill-in activity on the calculation of SUVR values when using different reference regions with and without WM. For this, we present a MC methodology for simulating realistic amyloid PET studies.

The inverse of the normalization transformation matrix was used to take the Hammersmith atlas [36] back into the native MRI space. Voxel tissue probability maps generated by the segmentation were binarized to generate GM, WM, and CSF masks by using a GM favoring approach. Voxels in the GM-WM and GM-CSF interfaces were considered GM when GM probability was > 0.1 unless WM (or CSF) probability was bigger than 0.5 [37] . The same approach was applied in the CSF-WM interface, favoring CSF over WM. The inverted Hammersmith atlas was multiplied by the GM mask to generate a GM patient-specific atlas. WM and CSF were added to the patient-specific atlas as uniform tissues (results of the different steps of the image processing are shown in Additional file 1: Supplementary Figure S1 ). PET images were smoothed to achieve a uniform isotropic resolution of 8 mm FWHM with the scanner-dependent smoothing values provided by ADNI (see Additional file 1: Supplementary Table S1 ) when required. The average cortex uptake was measured by using a composite region of interest (ROI) integrating the GM from the anterior and posterior cingulate, the precuneus, and the frontal, lateral temporal, and lateral parietal cortex. The WM mask was used as a ROI to calculate the average WM uptake. We also used an eroded WM ROI, generated as described in previous works [16] .

The theoretical SUVR CGM was maintained (SUVR WC values were not constant as our WM variability included WM on the cerebellum).

The corrections were applied without applying the smoothing to 8-mm included in the ADNI processing, directly convolving by the point-spread function (PSF) calculated for our MC simulation model. The corrections were performed by using the PETPVC toolbox [48] . This open-source package provides the necessary tools for applying a wide range of PVC methods. The toolbox is developed using C++ and optimized for fast execution times.\nFor the applied corrections, a segmented PET image is used as an input for the PSF deconvolution (see Additional file 1: Supplementary Figure S1 ). The segmented PET consists of an MRI-derived personalized atlas (generated as defined in the SUVR quantification section) filled with ROI values based on the PET image.\nThe RBV PVC [25] is an extension of the popular geometrical transfer matrix (GTM) method and the voxel-wise correction of Yang et al. [49] . The mean ROI activity values are calculated using the GTM, and then a voxel-by-voxel correction is performed in order to produce a corrected image by performing a voxel-wise multiplication of the uncorrected PET image with a PVE correction factor. This factor relates PVE corrected ROI values obtained by GTM with smoothed segmented PET voxel values. RBV was chosen for this work before the original GTM since it provides a corrected image, which facilitates the calculation of corrected SUVR values using the same methodology used for uncorrected images. In addition, RBV accounts for within-compartment variability, preventing biases in GM PVC corrected values due to WM variability.\nThe iY method [50] extends the aforementioned voxel-wise Yang method [49] process. In contrast with RBV, instead of calculating the regional mean values via the GTM, the values are estimated from the PET data itself. The Yang correction is applied and the mean value estimates are recalculated. This process is iterated several times (for this work, we used 10 iterations), updating the PET image at each iteration with the input of the previous iteration, providing more accurate correction factors.\nThe ability of PVC to reduce the measured effect was evaluated by applying different PVC methods to the simulated data (examples of images processed by the different PVCs are provided in Additional file 1: Supplementary Figure S6 ). The results of the quantification for the PVC data are shown in Fig. 6 . For the iY correction, the general linear model fitted to an average slope of 0.059 \u00b1 0.002, while for the RBV the average slope was 0.070 \u00b1 0.002, for SUVR CGM .\nFrom the results, it is clear that applying PVC can reduce the spill-in, but it should be noted that for the two used methods, the intercept values for the different patient fits vary significantly. These variations between the different PVCs were patientdependent, with iY providing a more accurate representation of the ground truth SUVR CGM for low WM-SUVR CGM (Additional file 1: Supplementary Figure S7 shows a comparison between the different measured values for RBV and iY and the ground truth simulated SUVR CGM ).

The effect of this correction over our patient cohort is shown in Fig. 7 ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Several publications have recently pointed to the fact that reference regions including WM provide better correlations with CSF levels and less longitudinal variability than the cerebellum cortex [11] [12] [13] [14] . Some points in favor of WM reference regions could be that WM is a larger region potentially leading to less noise, more resistant to small degrees of misregistration and in the center of the scanner field-of-view. Nevertheless, WM uptake is known to be non-specific, and its mechanisms are largely unknown, so it is not an ideal candidate for a reference region. In this work, our main hypotheses was that an additional point to take into account is that including WM into the reference region will also compensate (at least partially), the spill-in of WM counts into the cortex, which would lead otherwise to artificially increased SUVR values, especially for healthy controls with low cortex uptake [26] . In order to assess this, we have investigated the variability of the WM uptake across a population of healthy patients, and then we used MC simulation to evaluate, first, if these changes are enough to produce significant variations in cortex SUVR values, and second, if a reference region including WM (in our case the WC (GM+WM) effectively minimizes these variations. WM values on the evaluated patient cohort were in the range of 1.32-2.44, following a normal distribution centered in 1.79 with a percentage standard deviation of 13.6%. These values are in good agreement with previously published results [51] that reported WM averages of 1.92 \u00b1 0.23 for healthy patients. We also observed that the increase of uptake in the cerebellum WM was slower than in the rest of the WM (ratio approximately of \u2248 0.8). This difference could be attributed to PVE itself, as the size of the cerebellum WM is relatively small when compared to the rest of the WM. We observed a positive correlation between measured SUVR values and WM uptake, which was more prominent when using the CGM (r = 0.82) as a reference region, than when using a reference region containing WM, as the WC (r = 0.64). We observed that SUVR CGM increased by 0.28 units when WM-SUVR CGM increases one unit, while SUVR WC increased 0.13 units when WM-SUVR CGM increased one unit. This correlation is significantly higher than previously reported in 11 C-PIB [27] . This can be related to the fact that WM retention in 18 F-based tracers is significantly higher than in 11 C-PIB [52] . In addition, in the cited publication, authors use both amyloid-positive and amyloid-negative CN patients, which would also reduce the observed correlation (see Additional file 1: Supplementary Figure S5 ). We also showed that the correlation is present independently of using all the WM or only the eroded WM as defined by ADNI [16] , pointing that the spill-out of cortex counts into the WM is irrelevant in comparison with the WM spill-in. This is explained, again, by the fact that we are evaluating only amyloid-negative patients, where WM uptake is significantly higher than cortex uptake.\nRegarding our MC experiments, we simulated realistic maps with fixed cortex uptake, and variable WM uptake, and evaluated the variations of measured SUVRs following the same methodology used in patients. This way we isolate WM spill-in from any other physical or physiological effects, allowing a precise investigation of this particular effect. These experiments showed that the introduced WM variability produced correlations similar to those observed in patients. SUVR CGM increased by 0.23 units when WM-SUVR CGM increases one unit, while SUVR WC increased 0.11 units when WM-SUVR CGM increased one unit.\nTo evaluate the ability of PVC methods to remove this effect, we tested two different methods, iY and RBV, over the simulated data. These methods were used instead of more widespread alternatives such as M\u00fcller-G\u00e4rtner (MG) and GTM, since they have the ability to produce a corrected image, enabling to reproduce the exact same processing pipeline (with the removal of the smoothing to 8 mm) used in patient data. Both methods were able to reduce the observed dependency, reducing the aforementioned 0.23 slope for SUVR CGM to 0.06 and 0.07, respectively. It is important to remark that corrected SUVR for the different PVC methods were qualitatively different, something that has been previously highlighted in other publications [53, 54] . Once PVE was corrected, using the WC as the reference region produced a reduction of the SUVRs as WM increased. On the one hand, this finding reinforces our hypothesis of the compensation of spill-in counts by including WM counts as a key to the good performance of these reference regions. On the other hand, it seems to contradict previous findings pointing to the combination of WM reference regions and PVC as optimal for longitudinal reliability of the measurements and threshold-based separation [15, 55] , but this is not necessarily the case. In both cases, both amyloid-negative and positive subjects compose the patient cohort, and WM emerges as the best-suited reference region based on longitudinal performance. In such a case of study, spill-out due to atrophy and cortical thickness variations might play a more prominent role than spillin, since reduced WM-GM contrast is expected. Furthermore, WM variability has been shown to influence the accuracy of MG-based PVCs in cortical GM and also CGM, while RBV and iY account for within-compartment variability [25] , so our findings might still be compatible with those in these publications.\nIn brief, our results suggest that the correlation observed in patient data is largely produced by WM spill-in, and that it is reduced when introducing WM into the reference region. This could be an explanation as to why reference regions including WM perform better than CGM in longitudinal studies [13] [14] [15] . In addition, we observed that a very similar reduction of the effect of the PVE could be obtained by applying PVC and using CGM as a reference region, as it can be observed in Fig. 6 . This later implementation will be more convenient, as CGM is, theoretically, a better reference region. Nevertheless, further work would be required to investigate the effect of iY, RBV and other PVC methodologies on the analysis of longitudinal data.\nFinally, we evaluated the performance of a simple analytical correction, by applying the observed slope obtained in our MC simulation (that is strictly derived from PVE) to the patient data, in order to remove the previously described dependency. The results are presented in Fig. 7 . This simple correction was effective in reducing the previously observed correlation coefficients between SUVR CGM and WM-SUVR CGM (from 0.82 to 0.27) and between SUVR WC and WM-SUVR CGM (from 0.64 to 0.18). It is important to remark that, as it can be observed on Fig. 7 (bottom) , applying our linear correction does not remove all the correlation. This could be explained by the differences in resolution between our MC model and the real PET scanner (5-10%), or by other factors correlating SUVR CGM and WM-SUVR CGM that were not taken into account on our MC simulation. The main limitation of the presented correction is that the presented formulas will be applicable only for the ADNI cohort, or for other studies that have adopted the ADNI processing methodology, and only for amyloid-negative patients. Nevertheless, this type of correction might be of interest since it does not require additional processing of the image and it can be applied directly to previously calculated data tables and SUVR values, such as those provided by ADNI PET processing core at Berkeley. For applying this correction to cohorts with different image processing pipelines, the simulation needs to be repeated in order to recalculate the slopes and average WM-SUVR CGM for the proposed formulas. About the application on amyloid-positive patients, a clear limitation of the proposed methodology is that high cortex uptake will change the contrast relations between GM and WM, and thus, the amount of PVE and the calculated slope might also change [23] . A much more complex analysis including simulations for amyloid-positive patients in the whole range of SUVRs would be needed to generalize the proposed correction to the entire cohort. Nevertheless, the correlation observed in Fig. 3 is expected to decrease when the cortical amyloid load is high.\nAbout some additional limitations of the present work, our activity maps were extracted only for 5 of the initial cohort of 82 patients, all of them were scanned with the GE Discovery STE scanner. Applying the derived formulas to the entire cohort, we are assuming, first, that the smoothing values proposed by ADNI (see Additional file 1: Supplementary Table S1 ) correctly harmonize the resolution of the scanners in the cohort, and second, that the range of simulated ground truth SUVR values (0.9-1.21) is representative of the values on the cohort.

Measured PF for each of the scanners present in the ADNI database (measured by the ADNI) and smoothing applied to each of the scanners to obtain an isotropic 8-mm resolution (as proposed by the ADNI). Table 2 . Quantification results for all the analyzed patients, including the ADNI label for the patient (Patient), the quantified Cortex average (Cortex AVG), cerebellum grey matter average (CGM AVG), whole cerebellum average (WC AVG), white matter average (WM AVG), SUVRCWM, SUVRWC and the PET scanner."}]
