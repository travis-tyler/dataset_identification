Ongoing changes in relative sea levels and the potential for increasing storm surges due to anthropogenic climate change and other factors present challenges to national park managers. This report summarizes work done by the University of Colorado in partnership with the National Park Service (NPS) to provide sea level rise and storm surge projections to coastal area national parks using information from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and storm surge scenarios from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) models. This research is the first to analyze IPCC and NOAA projections of sea level and storm surge under climate change for U.S. national parks. Results illustrate potential future inundation and storm surge under four greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. In addition to including multiple scenarios, the analysis considers multiple time horizons (2030, 2050 and 2100). This analysis provides sea level rise projections for 118 park units and storm surge projections for 79 of those parks. Within the National Park Service, the National Capital Region is projected to experience the highest average rate of sea level change by 2100. The coastline adjacent to the Outer Banks Group of parks in the Southeast Region is projected to experience the highest sea level rise by 2100. The Southeast Region is projected to experience the highest storm surges based on historical data and NOAA storm surge models. These results are intended to inform park planning and adaptation strategies for resources managed by the National Park Service. Sea level change and storm surge pose considerable risks to infrastructure, archeological sites, lighthouses, forts, and other historic structures in coastal units of the national park system. Understanding projections for continued change can better guide protection of such resources for the benefit of long-term visitor enjoyment and safety. Photo 2.

While sea levels have been gradually rising since the last glacial maximum approximately 21,000 years ago (Clark et al. 2009, Lambeck et al. 2014, anthropogenic climate change has significantly increased the rate of global sea level rise (Grinsted et al. 2010, Church and White 2011, Slangen et al. 2016, Fasullo et al. 2016. Recent analyses reveal that the rate of sea level rise in the last century was greater than during any preceding century in at least 2,800 years , Sweet et al. 2017. Human activities continue to release carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere, causing the Earth's atmosphere to warm (IPCC 2013, Mearns et al. 2013, Melillo et al. 2014. Further warming of the atmosphere will cause sea levels to continue to rise, which will affect how we protect and manage our national parks. The rate of warming depends on numerous factors considered by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) under four different representative concentration pathways (RCPs; Moss et al. 2010, Meinshausen et al. 2011. Used as the basis for this report, the RCPs are climate change scenarios based on potential greenhouse gas concentration trajectories introduced in the fifth climate change assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2013). The IPCC's process-based approach for estimating future sea levels contrasts with other estimates from semi-empirical techniques that commonly generate higher numbers. This report provides estimates of sea level change due to climate change for 118 National Park Service units and estimates of storm surge for 79 of those units. As temperature increases, sea levels rise due to a number of factors that will be discussed in greater detail."}, {"section_title": "The Importance of Understanding Contemporary Sea Level Change for Parks", "text": "From rocky headlands to gentle beaches, some of the most splendid and beautiful places in the United States are national parks on our ocean shorelines. Over one quarter of all national park units are coastal parks, home to nesting shorebirds and sea turtles, historical forts and lighthouses, and opportunities for recreation and respite. Many are living witness to our national storytrue icons of our history (Photo 3). But despite their great diversity, importance, and ability to provide windows to the past, changes in sea level affect them all. Today's managers of these parks face new challenges-challenges unimagined by builders of the forts and lighthouses within them, challenges unprecedented for the species that inhabit them, and challenges unanticipated by those who secured these places as part of the National Park System. Knowledge of sea level projections must now augment managerial skills in park administration, resource protection and conservation, interpretation, and community and civic engagement. To support managers of coastal park units, this report provides projections for sea level change and storm surge under several scenarios. As a reference for staff, it also summarizes scientific understanding of the basis for these changes, and sources from which scientists develop sea level rise projections. As sea levels incrementally rise, periods of flooding caused by storms and hurricanes exacerbate the growing problem of coastal inundation (see list of terms). Peek et al. (2015) estimated that the value of infrastructure at risk in 40 National Park Service units could cost billions of dollars if these units were exposed to one-meter of sea level rise. The passage of Hurricane Sandy in 2012-and more recently Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in 2017-caused extensive and costly damage to infrastructure and resources in numerous coastal national park units. While single storms cannot be wholly attributed to anthropogenic climate change, sea level rise associated with climate change exacerbates the effects of associated storm surges, which may be even further amplified during the highest astronomical tides as occurred during Hurricane Sandy (Kemp and Horton 2013). The impacts of extreme storms can bring extreme costs, as tallied through loss of visitor access, impacts to gateway communities and local economies, investments in recovery, and/or the irrevocable loss of unique resources. For example, repair of damage caused in national parks affected by Hurricane Sandy alone exceeded $370,000,000. Under future scenarios of increasing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, models project increasing storm intensities (Mann and Emanuel 2006, Knutson et al. 2010, Lin et al. 2012, Ting et al. 2015. When this change in storm intensity (and therefore, storm surge) is combined with sea level rise, we expect to see increased coastal flooding, the permanent loss of land across much of the United States coastline, and in some locations, a much shorter return interval of flooding. For example, when Hurricane Sandy struck, it was estimated to have a return period between 398 (Lin et al. 2016) and 1570 (Sweet et al. 2013) years. Factoring in future sea level rise to these estimates reduces the potential return interval of a similar storm surge occurring in New York City by 2100 to between 50 years (Sweet et al. 2013) and 90 years (Lin et al. 2016). The aim of this report is to: 1) quantify projections of sea level rise in coastal National Park Service units over the next century based on the latest IPCC (2013) models, and 2) show how storm surge generated by hurricanes and extratropical storms could also affect these parks."}, {"section_title": "Format of This Report", "text": "This report contains five sections (introduction, methods, results, discussion, and conclusion), and presents results per park alphabetically by region. The 118 park units studied for this project cover six administrative regions: the Northeast, Southeast, National Capital, Intermountain, Pacific West, and Alaska. The scope of this project focuses on sea levels. The scope of this project did not include projected changes in lake levels, although interior waterways and lakes, especially the Great Lakes, are vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Further explanation on how to access the data from this project is available in the methods sections and accompanying appendices."}, {"section_title": "Frequently Used Terms", "text": "Definitions of the most basic terms used in this report occur on page ix. However, some terms require greater explanation for their use. For example, we follow the advice of Flick et al. (2012) in differentiating between the terms flooding and inundation. While many choose to use these terms interchangeably, we use the term \"flooding\" to describe the temporary impoundment of water on land. This usually results from storm activity and other short-lived events, such as periodic tidal action, and will therefore be used here in reference to the effects of a storm surge on land. \"Inundation\" refers to the gradual permanent submergence of land that will occur due to sea level rise. The terms sea level rise and sea level change are also used differently. Sea level rise refers only to rising water levels resulting from an increase in global ocean volumes. In most parts of the United States this increase in water volume will lead to increasing relative sea levels. However, in some parts of the country relative sea level is decreasing due to isostatic rebound. Figure 1 shows current sea level trends based on tide gauge records for United States that span at least 30-years of data. For example, Southeast Alaska is experiencing a decrease in relative sea level. Alaska's crust continues to rebound following the melting of large volumes of ice that occurred for centuries to millennia on land in the form of glaciers and ice fields. Alaska is tectonically complex with extensive faults that contribute to this crustal motion. Although the volume of ocean water in this region is increasing, the rate of sea level rise is less than the rate of isostatic rebound, resulting in a decrease in relative sea level. For this reason, we use the term \"sea level change\" as it includes regions that will experience a decrease in relative sea level (at least in the early part of this century) as well as those that will see increasing relative sea levels.

Green dots represent stations that are experiencing the average global rate of sea level change. Stations depicted by yellow to red dots are experiencing greater than the global average (primarily driven by regional subsidence) and blue to purple dots are stations experiencing less than the global average (due to isostatic rebound or other tectonically-driven factors).

Consultation with regional managers regarding units they considered to be potentially vulnerable to sea level change and/or storm surge resulted in selection of these 118 coastal park units (Appendix B). Project activities included the following: 1) Prepare sea level projections over multiple time horizons for each park unit. 2) Estimate potential exposure to storm surge using the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Sea, Lake, and Overland Surge from Hurricanes (SLOSH) Model and Tebaldi et al. (2012). 3) Create wayside exhibits 1 with information about the impacts of climate change in the coastal zone for three National Park Service units. Based on site recommendations from regional personnel, three National Park Service units now have completed wayside exhibits in place: Gulf Islands National Seashore, Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve, and Fire Island National Seashore, each with customized designs that reflect the messaging and/or themes of each unit. This report provides results from the first two project activities: sea level rise projections, and potential exposure to storm surge."}, {"section_title": "Sea Level Rise Data", "text": "Sea level rise is caused by numerous factors. As human activities release CO2 and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, mean global temperatures increase (IPCC 2013). Rising global temperatures cause ice located on land and in the sea to melt. The melting of ice found on land, such as Greenland and Antarctica, is a significant driver of sea level rise. While the melting of sea ice is problematic from an oceanographic and heat budget perspective (primarily because it alters water temperatures and salinity and also because it changes the reflectance of solar energy from the surface), melting sea ice does not cause sea level rise. It is the melting of ice that is currently stored on land that raises global sea levels. Water level does not change when sea ice (ice wholly supported by water) melts. The volume of water in the sea remains the same whether it is frozen or liquid. The phase shift of water from solid to liquid does not displace an additional volume of water. As ocean waters warm, the density of these waters also changes, causing thermal expansion. Thermal expansion was responsible for two-fifths of sea level rise from 1993 to 2010, while melting ice accounted for half (IPCC 2013). Table 1 lists the contribution to sea level rise from several key sources. The IPCC sea level rise projections used in this analysis follow a process-based model approach, which estimates sea level based on the underlying physical processes. This contrasts with semiempirical models that combine past sea level observations with other variables or theoretical considerations, including, in some cases, expert opinion (surveys or interviews of professionals) (Rahmstorf 2010, Orlic andPasaric 2013). Often the semi-empirical approach yields higher sea level estimates. IPCC (2013) uses coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) to simulate the processes of change rather than the statistical inferences of the semi-empirical approach. AOGCMs are considered a process-based technique, although some variables derive from semiempirical methods (IPCC 2013). Sea level rise estimates for 2050 and 2100 were taken directly from the IPCC (2013) regional climate models (RCMs) downscaled to a spatial grid resolution of 1\u02da x 1\u02da from AOGCMs. Because many park units require estimates for shorter time horizons that fit more closely with the expected lifetime of various projects, sea level rise projections for 2030 were calculated using IPCC RCM data for each sea level rise driver shown in Table 2, interpolated to 2030 for each RCP. All projections are reported relative to the period 1986\uf02d2005 (see Appendix B for further discussion). All geographic information systems (GIS) maps display the projected sea level on top of mean higher-high water (MHHW) using the most recent tidal datum epoch (1983)(1984)(1985)(1986)(1987)(1988)(1989)(1990)(1991)(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001). MHHW is calculated by averaging the highest daily water level over a 19-year tidal datum epoch. The standard error ( ) for each site estimate was not calculated because it was beyond the scope of this project. However, it can be calculated using the following equation and data available from the IPCC (2013, supplementary material): Where: steric/dyn = the global thermal expansion uncertainty plus dynamic sea surface height; smb_a = the Antarctic ice sheet surface mass balance uncertainty; smb_g = the Greenland ice sheet surface mass balance uncertainty; glac = glacier uncertainty; IBE = the inverse barometer effect uncertainty; GIA = global isostatic adjustment; LW = the land water uncertainty; dyn_a = Antarctica ice sheet rapid dynamics uncertainty; and, dyn_g = Greenland ice sheet rapid dynamics uncertainty. Initial data were exported as GeoTIFF files for use in ArcGIS. For parks that crossed more than one pixel, an average sea level rise was calculated by weighting pixel values by the length of park shoreline in each pixel. A standard bathtub model approach was used to identify areas of projected inundation and flooding. In this method, projected sea level under climate change was determined by adding the IPCC RCM value to the current mean higher high water level. The land that would be at or below a projected sea level was then determined by analyzing digital elevation models (DEMs) of land elevation at spatial resolutions of 500 to 7000 m, depending on data availability for the areas of each park. DEM data for most regions were gathered from the NOAA digital coast website (https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast). Areas of inundation and flooding are denoted in the maps (Appendix A) in blue. Additional low-lying areas that could be potentially inundated or flooded are shown in green ( Figure 2). These low-lying areas do not appear to have any inlet or other pathway for water (based on our elevation datasets), although they should still be considered vulnerable to exposure to either groundwater seepage or potential flooding via breaching. The lack of highresolution DEMs and time constraints prevented us from attempting a dynamic modeling approach (see limitations below). Maps were created to illustrate inundation for all park units for 2050 and 2100 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. These two represent a plausible range of scenarios between significant policy response (RCP4.5) and business as usual (RCP8.5). "}, {"section_title": "Storm Surge Data", "text": "NOAA SLOSH data estimate potential storm surge height at current (most recent tidal datum) sea level (NOAA 2016). The NOAA SLOSH model comprises the following three products (P-Surge, MEOW, and MOMs) that utilize three different modeling approaches (probabilistic, deterministic, and composite) to estimate storm surge. P-Surge (also known as the tropical cyclone storm surge probabilities product) uses a probabilistic approach by examining past events to estimate the storm surge generated by a cyclone that is present and within 72-hours of landfall. It statistically evaluates National Hurricane Center data (calculated in part using a deterministic approach) including the official projected cyclone track and historical forecasting errors. It also incorporates astronomical tide calculations and variations in the radius of maximum wind into this estimate. These rates of motion variables are then fit to a Cartesian or polar (depending on the location) grid (Jalesnianski et al. 1992). The Maximum Envelope Of Water (MEOW) calculates flooding using past SLOSH output to create a composite estimate of the potential storm surge generated by a hypothetical storm. This product generates a worst-case scenario based on a hypothetical storm category that includes forward speed, trajectory of the storm when it strikes the coastline, and initial (mean vs. high) tide level that will also incorporate any historical uncertainty from previous landfall forecasts. The final SLOSH product is the MOM (Maximum of MEOWs) model. MOM is a further composite approach that uses the forward speed, trajectory, and initial tide level data that is also used by MEOW to create a worst-of-the-worst scenario (or \"perfect storm\"). Storms are simulated for 32 regions (also known as operational basins, Figure 3) defined by NOAA. Data was imported into ArcGIS using the SLOSH display program. Maps were generated showing storm surge for all possible Saffir-Simpson hurricane categories for each site. While most sites had data for Saffir-Simpson hurricane categories 1\uf02d5 (Table 3), a few sites, such as Acadia National Park, were missing the highest category. NOAA did not model this scenario because it is considered extremely unlikely at a location that far north in the Atlantic Ocean.   Tebaldi et al. (2012) used 55 long-term tide gauge records to calculate potential sea level and storm surge estimates above mean high water levels. We used the current 50year and 100-yr return level data from their paper for any parks near a tide gauge. Unfortunately, due to insufficient coverage by tide gauges in this area, we were unable to use either Tebaldi et al. (2012) or SLOSH MOM data for the Alaska, Guam, Saipan, and American Samoa park units. It is important to note that the Tebaldi et al. (2012) and SLOSH MOM data differ in their methods of calculation making it inadvisable to compare storm surge values from the Pacific West Region to other regions. However, this method had to be used due to the lack of SLOSH MOM data for the Pacific West Region. We recommend that parks planning for future hurricanes use information from one hurricane category higher than any previous storm experienced. Historical hurricane data from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS; Knapp et al. 2010) is listed in Appendix D (Table D3) to allow staff to determine the highest Saffir-Simpson category hurricane to strike within 10 miles of each park unit. Applying information from one storm category higher than historical data may more closely approximate what could happen in the future, as storms are projected to be more intense under continued climate change (Emanuel 2005, Webster 2005, Mendelsohn et al. 2012). However, we recommend caution in using this approach for any detailed (site-level) planning due to limitations discussed in the following section of this report."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "All projects of this nature have limitations that should be clearly described to ensure appropriate use and interpretation of these data. Every effort has been made to incorporate any parks established after this project began (e.g. Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument); however, some maps might be missing due to lack of available boundary data in new units. Sea level and storm surge estimates were derived using separate programs from the IPCC and NOAA, respectively. These numbers were then imported into GIS maps using the program ArcGIS. We used a bathtub modeling approach to map the extent of sea level rise and storm surge over every unit. Bathtub modeling simply simulates how high or how far inland water will go under different climate change scenarios. It does not recognize changes in topography or other environmental or artificial systems that may exist or occur in response to encroaching water. Although the bathtub model is the most widely used technique for modeling inundation, it is also a simplistic approach to simulating how sea level rise will affect a landscape (Storlazzi et al. 2013). Dynamic models could simulate changes in flow around buildings or estimate how topographic features such as dune systems may migrate in response to inundation and flooding, but dynamic models also vary, which can be a severe limitation in trying to standardize data for summary analysis and comparison. The maps provided through this analysis vary in horizontal and vertical accuracy depending on which digital elevation model (DEM) data were available at the time of mapping. This is discussed in more detail in the metadata that accompany each map. DEM data for most regions were gathered from the NOAA digital coast website (https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/) which uses source elevation data that either meet or exceed current Federal Emergency Management mapping specifications. These NOAA digital coast data were required to have a minimum root mean square error of 18.5 cm for low lying areas that were then corrected for MHHW using the NOAA VDatum model (Parker et al. 2003). USGS data were used for areas, such as Alaska, where digital coastal data were not available. We recommend referring to Schmid et al. (2014) for further discussion on potential uncertainty of this technique. Although SLOSH MOM has the widest geographic storm surge coverage of any model in the US, storm surge data were not available for every part of the coastline. Every effort has been made by this project to bridge any gaps where SLOSH MOM does not exist. While the Tebaldi et al. (2012) data cover the California, Oregon, Washington, and southern Alaskan coastlines, they do not cover northern Alaskan, American Samoa, Saipan, or Guam coastlines. These coastlines are vulnerable to storm surge but we could not find data that satisfied our standards of accuracy sufficiently to be included in our mapping efforts. Furthermore, storm surge maps are only intended as a rough guide of how flooding caused by storm surge will look today. As more of the coastline becomes inundated we can expect coastal flooding patterns to also change accordingly. The SLOSH model is a multiple scenario approach that uses previous storms to estimate future storm surge. It cannot take into account changes in future basin morphology that could affect the fluid dynamics and propagation of coastal flooding. SLOSH MOM is modeled using mean sea level (0 m NAVD88) and what NOAA terms \"high tide\" (which is not tied to the local tidal datum, but is actually a round number based on the modeled average high tide for the region). Jalesnianski et al. (1992) estimate surge estimates to be accurate +/-20%, although Glahn et al. (2009) discuss how others have found the P-Surge model to be more accurate than originally estimated. Such factors must be kept in mind when using these numbers for mapping."}, {"section_title": "Land Level Change", "text": "It is important to include changes in land level while interpreting changes in sea level. The IPCC (2013) includes a limited amount of data regarding changes in relative sea level in their calculations of sea level change. Our sea level rise results include the IPCC estimates of how changes in land level will change over time based on estimates of glacial isostatic adjustment. Land level change is an important variable when calculating relative sea level. Land levels have changed over time in response to numerous factors. Changes in various land-based loadings-such as ice sheets during the last glacial maximum-has been a significant cause of land level change in the U.S. Post-glacial isostatic rebound is the result of this pressure being released after the removal of ice sheets on the Earth's crust. Land level can also be altered by other factors such as tectonic shifts, particularly along the Alaska and continental U.S. Pacific coastlines. These drivers can often prompt a relative increase or decrease in land level depending on location. Other factors such as aquifer drawdown and the draining of coastal wetlands can create decreases in relative land level. Quantifying how land levels are changing is difficult given the paucity of data available prior to modern satellite data. An upcoming NASA publication on land-based movement (Nerem pers. comm.) will help to address this data need, providing numbers for land-based movement across the country. Data from the NASA report can then be incorporated with sea level rise numbers from this analysis using the following equation (after Lentz et al. 2016): Where; ae is the adjusted elevation, E0 is the initial land elevation, ei is the future sea level for either 2030, 2050, or 2100, and R is the current rate of land movement over time due to isostatic adjustments. In the interim, tide gauges can provide further data regarding changes in land level, but should be used cautiously. We have listed tide gauge data for the rate of change in land level for tide gauges nearest to all units for this study in Appendix D; however, only Fort Pulaski National Monument and Golden Gate National Recreation Area have a long-term tide gauge on site. This lack of nearby longterm data can limit the accuracy of these numbers if they are applied to sea level change projections for almost all other parks units. We indicate in Table D1 which of the nearest tides gauges we do not recommend using to estimate land movement. This is because in many cases the boundary of the park unit is located either too far away or on a different land mass to where the nearest tide gauge is, which increases the inaccuracy of this data. Land level changes were only reported for long-term tide gauges that had at least thirty years of data in order to ensure a statistically robust dataset. Based on these limited records, we estimate that seven park units are currently experiencing decreasing relative sea levels (Glacier Bay National Park, Glacier Bay Preserve, Katmai National Park, Kenai Fjords National Park, Lake Clark National Park, Sitka National Historical Park), although we cannot be certain of this number given that many of the park units are some distance from a tide gauge. A discussion of the applicability of these land level numbers (with a natural resources manager or similar expert) should accompany use of individual park maps from this analysis to ensure that the nearest tide gauge to any particular project site is appropriate. Current rates of subsidence at these tide gauges range between +7.6 mm/y (Grand Isle, Louisiana) and -19 mm/y (Skagway, Alaska; Table D1). In selecting an appropriate tide gauge to use, variables including oceanographic setting, length of the record, completeness of data, and geography of the coastline must be considered. The science team for this project decided against setting a threshold for how close a park unit should be to a long-term tide gauge based on considerations discussed above."}, {"section_title": "Where to Access the Data", "text": "All GIS data from this project are available at https://irma.nps.gov/Portal for archiving by park.

A full list of the 118 park units and a table listing sea level projections by park are available in Appendix D. Following the methods outlined above, we found that sea level rise projections across the 118 park units average between 0.45 m (RCP2.6) and 0.67 m (RCP8.5) by 2100. However, this number masks how these projections will vary geographically. Figure 4 shows these projections in more detail and provides sea level estimates by region. Error bars in Figure 4 denote the standard deviation for each average per region, further revealing how these numbers can vary. A high standard deviation and range signals that sea level estimates vary between units within regions, whereas a low standard deviation and small range are to be expected in smaller regions where sea level rise estimates do not cover such a large geographic area. Based on the averages per region, we found that the shoreline within the National Capital Region is projected to experience the highest sea level rise by 2100 (0.80 m RCP8.5), although this number does not include the full extent of changes in land level over the same time interval. The shoreline near Wright Brothers National Memorial in the Southeast Region has the highest overall projected sea level rise (0.82 m, RCP8.5, 2100). Glacier Bay Preserve and Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park are tied for lowest projected sea level rise at 0.33 m using RCP8.5 for 2100. The Alaska Region also has the highest standard deviation among park units. The National Capital Region conversely has very little standard deviation due to the compact nature of the region (meaning that all of the parks units fell within the same raster cell). This is not to say that all of the parks will experience exactly the same rate of sea level rise, but that the IPCC model projected that sea levels could rise up to an average 0.80 m (RCP8.5) for that region by 2100. The sea level rise maps (discussed in the National Capital section below) illustrate differences among the National Capital parks in more detail.   Storm surge was mapped for 79 park units. We list data for one storm category higher than the highest historical storm in Table D3 in Appendix D. Some (31) park units did not have a historical storm path occurrence within 10 miles of their boundaries, so a Saffir-Simpson hurricane 1 was simulated for these locations. The lack of a historical storm does not mean that these parks are not subject to strong storms. It may merely be that these parks are in regions that either do not have extensive historical records or they experience strong storms, such as nor'easters, that behave differently and are not part of the NOAA database. The Southeast Region has the strongest historical hurricanes (average of highest recorded storm categories = 2.79), followed by the Intermountain Region (average = 2.33), National Capital Region (average = 1.90), and the Northeast (average = 1.03). None of the historical data intersected with the 10-mile (16.1 km) buffers around the Alaska Region parks. The Pacific West Region has experienced some tropical depressions, particularly in Hawaii, but most of their storm surges are driven by other phenomena, such as mid-latitude cyclones or extreme tides (sometimes colloquially referred to as king tides). The strongest (highest winds) and most intense (lowest pressure at landfall) recorded historical storm to have impacted a park unit was the \"Labor Day Hurricane\" that passed within 10 miles of Everglades National Park in 1935. While this storm may have been the highest intensity storm, it is certainly not the most damaging or costly storm in National Park Service history."}, {"section_title": "Northeast Region", "text": "Colonial National Historical Park, Fort Monroe National Monument, and Petersburg National Battlefield have the highest projected sea level rise in 2050 and 2100, and, together with Edgar Allen Poe National Historic Site, Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine, Independence National Historical Park, and Thaddeus Kosciusko National Memorial (parks near coastlines) they also have the highest projected sea level rise for 2030. However, while these parks may have ranked highly, caution should be used in applying these results. Many of these parks do not have coastline and so these projections are based on sea level rise for the coastline adjacent to these parks. The maps in Appendix A show how the projected sea level rise may affect each of these parks. Colonial National Historical Park, Fort McHenry, and Fort Monroe National Monument are the only park units of this highest rise grouping that contain coastline with their boundaries.  Regarding storm surge, the highest recorded storm to have travelled within 10 miles of any of the 29 parks units identified for study was an officially unnamed hurricane in 1869 known colloquially as Saxby's Gale, which was classified as a Saffir-Simpson 3 hurricane. The storm path passed presentday Boston National Historical Park and Roger Williams National Memorial. Figure 8 shows the estimated extent and height of a storm surge from category 3 hurricane striking Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area at mean tide. "}, {"section_title": "Southeast Region", "text": "Historically, the Southeast Region has the highest intensity storms (highest Saffir-Simpson storm category); Everglades National Park has recorded a category 5 hurricane within 10 miles of its boundary, the colored areas in Figure 9 indicate the potential height and extent of a storm generated by two different categories of hurricane. A category 2 hurricane could completely flood the park. Future storm surges will be exacerbated by future sea level rise nationwide; this could be especially dangerous for the Southeast Region where they already experience hurricane-strength storms. Moreover, sea level rise projections only include changes in land movement due to glacial isostatic adjustment and do not include the full range of drivers of potential changes in land level. Using Table  D1 from Appendix D as a rough guide, changing land level for parks near tide gauges can be evaluated. For example, the Eugene Island, Louisiana tide gauge's current rate of sea level rise is the highest in the country at 9.65 mm/y, owing in part to the large rate of subsidence in the region (Figure 1). Using the nearest tide gauge to Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve (Grand Isle, Louisiana, gauge 8761724) we can estimate that land will subside by 7.60 mm/y. Applying this estimate of subsidence (using a baseline of 1992) to our RCP8.5 projections, the park could experience approximately 0.41 m of relative sea level rise by 2030 followed by 0.69 m by 2050 and 1.50 m by 2100. This is an inexact estimate of the land movement for the park given that Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve is approximately 60 miles (97 km) from the tide gauge; still, factoring in changes in land level, we can see that relative change in sea level is more than double the projected change in sea level using the IPCC estimates alone. This analysis projects that, by 2100, the shoreline adjacent to Wright Brothers National Memorial may have the greatest sea level rise among the Southeast Region's parks (0.82 m RCP8.5). Given elevations within the park, this may not inundate a large area of the memorial, unless combined with other factors such as a storm surge. For example, the park may be almost completely flooded if a category 2 or higher hurricane strikes on top of inundation from sea level rise. Nearby parks in the Outer Banks Group, including Cape Hatteras and Cape Lookout National Seashores, are projected to experience sea level rise of up to 0.79 m and 0.76 m, respectively (RCP8.5) by 2100, resulting in large areas of inundation. While sea level rise around these national seashores may not be as high as what has been projected for Wright Brothers National Memorial, they serve as examples of how caution must be used when using these numbers to assess which park units are most vulnerable to sea level rise. Other factors, such as percent of exposed land, changes in land movement, and adaptive capacity must also be taken into account for vulnerability analyses (Peek et al. 2015). "}, {"section_title": "National Capital", "text": "National Capital Region has minimal variability in projected sea level rise because all park units selected for study are adjacent to the same section of coastline that was modeled. Their proximity also explains why they share the same storm history. Despite these similarities, projected sea level rise may affect each individual park unit differently based on local topography. The strongest storm recorded within 10 miles (16.1 km) of the National Capital Region parks was a Saffir-Simpson category 2 hurricane that struck the city in 1878. While the 1878 storm caused relatively little damage, we can expect a significantly larger amount of damage if a similar storm struck the city again given considerable development now existing in the area. Figure 10 shows the extent of flooding caused by a Saffir-Simpson category 2 hurricane. A storm surge measuring more than 3 m could travel up the Potomac River causing large amounts of flooding. Such a storm surge could be worse by the end of this century given projected sea level rise around the Capital Region of up to 0.8 m. IPCC/SLOSH models showed either storm surge or sea level rise (or some combination of the two) affecting every National Capital Region park included in this analysis, with the exception of Harpers Ferry National Historical Park. Our mapping efforts revealed that Harpers Ferry National Historical Park (located approximately 149 m above sea level) is unlikely to experience any impacts of sea level rise due to its elevation and is unlikely to be damaged by storm surge from a hurricane, given its relatively protected location behind several dams along the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers. Sea level rise alone is not expected to spread very far into Washington D.C., although a large section on the east side of Theodore Roosevelt Island could be inundated. However, storm surge flooding on top of this sea level rise would have widespread impacts."}, {"section_title": "Intermountain Region", "text": "The Intermountain Region covers mostly inland park units stretching from Texas to Montana. Within the region, only three park units in Texas are subject to sea level change: Big Thicket National Preserve, Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Park, and Padre Island National Seashore. Of these, Padre Island National Seashore may experience the greatest effects of sea level and storm surge; sea level is projected to rise 0.46\uf02d0.69 m (RCP2.6\uf02d8.5, Figure 11) by 2100. The same amount of sea level rise is projected for the shoreline near Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Park, but inundation is not projected to extend far enough to reach the park. Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Park has no history of being within 10 miles of any hurricane, making the site unlikely to be flooded by storm surge. SLOSH MOM models for the park unit show that that the region would have to have either a Saffir-Simpson category 4 hurricane striking at high tide or a category 5 hurricane striking at any tide in order for the park to experience any storm surge. On the other hand, Figure 12 shows that Padre Island National Seashore, located to the east of Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Park, historically was within 10 miles of a category 4 hurricane. SLOSH MOM data show that should a category 4 hurricane occur here again, it would likely flood almost the entire island. Storm surge could potentially travel up the Neches River and flood the southernmost part of Big Thicket National Preserve, although both artificial and natural storm surge defenses in Beaumont, Texas, to the south of the preserve, may buffer it from any surge.  "}, {"section_title": "Pacific West Region", "text": "The Pacific West Region identified 24 park units for analysis in this study that could be vulnerable to sea level rise and/or storm surge. These units occur over a large area that includes California, Oregon, Washington, Hawaii, American Samoa, Saipan, and Guam. War in the Pacific National Historical Park in Guam has the highest projected sea level rise at 0.68 m (RCP8.5) by 2100, and shares the highest projected sea level rise with almost all of the Hawaiian park units in 2030 and 2050. The average projected sea level rise range is 0.40\uf02d0.58 m (RCP2.6\uf02d8.5) by 2100 for the whole region; high standard deviations (0.04 m and 0.08 m for RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively) indicate that park-specific projections vary widely across the region. "}, {"section_title": "Alaska Region", "text": "The Alaska Region has the lowest average projected sea level rise (0.28\uf02d0.43 m by 2100) compared to the five regions described above. Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve and Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park in southeastern Alaska share the lowest projected sea level rise (0.33 m, RCP8.5, 2100) while Bering Land Bridge National Preserve on the west coast of the state has the highest projected sea level rise (0.60 m, RCP8.5, 2100). Figure 1 shows how current relative sea levels vary across the state. Land levels are rapidly rising in the southeast of the region due to isostatic rebound and other tectonic shifts. The net result of these increasing land levels is decreasing relative sea levels for at least the early part of this century. Relative sea level in Skagway, Alaska is decreasing at an average rate of 17.6 mm/y (Zervas 2009). Despite melting ice and other factors outlined in Table 1 that increase ocean water volume, the amount of rising water is insufficient to keep up with land level changes. Seven park units (Glacier Bay National Park, Glacier Bay National Preserve, Katmai National Park, Kenai Fjords National Park, Lake Clark National Park, Sitka National Historical Park) are identified as potentially having decreasing relative sea levels based on the nearest tide gauge data to each of these parks. None of these parks have long-term tide gauges with data spanning at least thirty years. A great strength of using the IPCC (2013) process-based model approach is that, unlike many other semi-empirical models, it does not rely on long-term tide gauge records to statistically project future sea levels. However, sea level projections in this analysis do not include changes in land level. The estimates that we report here represent the expected rise due to water volume expansion alone near to each of these park units. Table D1 shows how land levels are changing at long-term tide gauges across the country. However, given that all of these park units are located far from a tide gauge and that the region is relatively geologically complex, we do not recommend using the land movement numbers from the nearest tide gauge for any of the Alaskan parks. Storm surge is also very difficult to model for this region. Historically, many of the parks had sea ice along the coastline that helped protect these parks from storm surge. Consequently, NOAA does not have SLOSH MOM models for this region. IBTrACS data (Knapp et al. 2010) show a few storm paths that have moved towards the region, but these types of storms typically do not make landfall once they move over colder waters. Alaska does hold the record for the highest intensity (lowest central pressure) storm (Duff 2015). A downgraded super typhoon, Nuri, struck Adak Island, Alaska, in 2014 with recorded winds gusting up to 122 mph. It is impossible to determine an average or peak historical storm surge without adequate tide gauge data."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Global mean sea levels have been rising since the last glacial maximum (Lambeck and Chappell 2001, Clark and Mix 2002, Lambeck et al. 2014. Church and White (2006) estimated that twentieth century global sea levels rose at a rate of approximately 1.7 mm/y, although this rate accelerated over the latter part of the century. Slangen et al. (2016) found that emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities have been the primary driver of global sea level change since 1970 and that the rate of sea level rise has increased over time (Table 1). Satellite altimetry data shows that present-day global relative sea levels are increasing at approximately 3.3 mm/y (Cazenave et al. 2014, Fasullo et al. 2016). The IPCC (2013) projects that, without greenhouse gas emissions reductions, this rate will increase, and that global average sea levels could rise by 0.40\uf02d0.63 m (RCP2.6\uf02d8.5) by 2100. We used regional sea level projections from the IPCC (2013) generated for 2050 and 2100 in combination with our interpolated projections for 2030 to estimate the amount of sea level rise 118 coastal national park units could experience in the future. Our projections are based on the new representative concentration pathways (Moss et al. 2010, Figure 13), using a process-based model approach. Figure 13. Radiative forcing (see list of terms) for each of the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). An increase in radiative forcing (due to the loading of anthropogenic gases into the atmosphere) will result in higher global average temperatures. RCPs replace the IPCC SRES scenarios. Note how RCP4.5 (yellow line) projections are slightly higher than RCP6.0 (gray line) in the early part of this century. Source: Meinshausen et al. 2011. Numerous academic articles use mostly semi-empirical models (Rahmstorf 2007) to estimate sea level rise regions across the U.S. The IPCC (2013) lists several semi-empirical sea level rise estimates, all of which result in projections of future sea level that are higher than the IPCC (2013) approach. The differences in these approaches can be attributed to many factors. For example, some of the older papers may have higher sea level estimates because they are based on the older IPCC SRES scenarios (e.g. Vermeer and Rahmstorf 2009. Other papers may include input from \"expert elicitations\" in their sea level projections, in which experts provide their opinion on how much sea level (or a related factor) could rise in the future (e.g. Bamber and Aspinall 2013, Jevrejeva et al. 2014, Horton et al. 2014. Some published articles criticize the IPCC sea level estimates as being too conservative or underestimating rates of future sea level change (e.g. Kerr 2013, Horton et al. 2014. Church et al. (2013) addresses these criticisms by explaining how the IPCC define the probability and likelihood of their estimates, and so they are not discussed in detail here. Recent analyses by Clark et al. (2015) further support the findings of the IPCC. A key strength of the methods used in this analysis lies in providing a unified approach to identify how sea level change may affect all coastal park units across the National Park System, rather than relying on sea level data generated for specific areas. Our analyses revealed that the National Capital Region is projected to experience the greatest increase in sea level (not taking into account changes in land level). This rise will affect each of the region's units in different ways depending on the elevation of the individual unit, but it could be significant if combined with a storm surge from a storm such as the Saffir-Simpson category 2 hurricane in 1878. At the individual park level, IPCC projections reveal the sea level along the coastline adjacent to Wright Brothers National Memorial could rise up 0.82 m (RCP8.5) by 2100, which could lead to significant flooding if the dynamic landforms are not able to keep pace with such high rates of sea level rise. In addition, storm surge impacts at this higher sea level would be significant. The Southeast Region as a whole is generally susceptible to inundation and flooding due to its low-lying nature in many places, particularly in Cape Hatteras and Cape Lookout National Seashores. Our sea level rise maps (Appendix A) highlight how much all of these park units may be affected. These estimates do not include the latest data on changing land levels. The IPCC included estimates of global isostatic adjustment (Equation 1) in their predictions, but those do not include changes in land level due to other factors, such as earthquakes and groundwater extraction. We can roughly estimate relative sea level change for a small number of parks based on current rates of subsidence gathered from nearby long-term tide gauge data. We project Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve to have the greatest relative sea level increase based on the current rate of land movement. Our sea level projections agree with current sea level trends in showing that the southeast Alaska region is experiencing the least amount of sea level rise of anywhere in the National Park System. Sallenger et al. (2012) discussed how changes in Atlantic Ocean temperatures and salinity (resulting from changes in circulation) could lead to changes in sea level that could create a 1000-km long \"hotspot\" along the North Atlantic coast from Cape Cod, Massachusetts to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. We estimate that almost all of the coastal park units in this area would be flooded under these conditions. It is unknown exactly to what degree future storm surge will affect the Alaskan park units. Accurate long-term (>30 years) storm surge data do not exist for the Alaska region. Even if such data did exist, it would be not be analogous to future conditions in the region because sea ice that had previously protected the shores for many of the western Alaska park units melts to reveal an easily erodible coastline (Frey et al. 2015). The warming of ocean waters in the Gulf of Alaska and Pacific Ocean could also make it more conducive for more storms like Typhoon Nuri to travel north without losing energy as under historic conditions. The Pacific West Region shows high variability among parks. War in The Pacific National Historical Park in Guam ranks highest in projected sea level rise among units in the Pacific West Region. The large area of the region partly explains the relatively high standard deviation in results for the region. The tectonically complex setting of many of the region's parks also complicates future sea level estimates. Changes in land movement are somewhat gradual nationwide in comparison to Alaska and the Pacific West Region, especially where earthquakes can rapidly change the position of the land relative to the sea. Island park units in general are particularly exposed to the impacts of sea level change and storm surge. Many of the barrier island parks, such as Fire Island National Seashore, Assateague Island National Seashore, Padre Island National Seashore, Gulf Islands National Seashore, and Cape Hatteras National Seashore, are all projected to experience sea level rise of over 0.69 m by 2100 (RCP8.5). This sea level rise, combined with storm surge, could be especially difficult for isolated island park units, such as the Caribbean park units, the National Park of American Samoa, and War in the Pacific National Historical Park, where access to aid in the event of a natural disaster may not be immediately available."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This report presents projections of sea level change (118 parks) and storm surge (79 parks) in coastal park units administered by the National Park Service. Sea level change and storm surge vary geographically, resulting in locally-specific challenges for adaptation and management. It is important to acknowledge that sea level change will affect some parts of Alaska differently than coastal parks in the rest of the country. Northwest Alaska can expect relative sea levels to increase over time; while in southeast Alaska, relative sea levels may continue to decrease over the first part of this century, followed by an increase in relative sea level towards the end of the century. This project is an important first step in assessing how changes in sea level and storm surge may affect national park units. Using sea level rise and storm surge information, parks can begin to plan for effects on resources, facilities, access, and other areas of management. While methods used here are not appropriate for combining the separate sea level rise and storm surge results, parks should be aware of the potential for synergistic effects of sea level rise and storm surge causing impacts larger than either may cause individually. It is clear that more research can be done on these complex issues to assess how these changes may affect parks and regions. These data can inform future projects related to both natural and cultural resources as well as the planning and management of infrastructure. B-2"}, {"section_title": "Q.

As you move further away from this location you can expect actual sea level to differ from the mean sea level at Rimouski. For locations such as California this can result in a significant difference between observed mean sea level and NAVD88.

Why don't you recommend that I add storm surge numbers on top of the sea level change numbers?", "text": "A. Higher sea level and permanent inundation will change the way waves propagate within a basin. Sea level change is expected to have a significant impact on the geomorphology of the coastline. Changing water levels will lead to areas of greater erosion in some areas as well as increasing accretion in other places. As sea level changes, the fluid dynamics of a particular region will also change. For example, tidal distance will change as water levels rise, which will alter the spatial extent of a storm surge as well as potentially impacting wave height. This is not something NOAA takes into account in their SLOSH model. A. No. As explained above, these numbers are accurate within a certain range.
