[{"section_title": "", "text": "This fifth edition of explaining extreme events of the previous year (2015) from a climate perspective continues to provide evidence that climate change is altering some extreme event risk. Without exception, all the heat-related events studied in this year's report were found to have been made more intense or likely due to human-induced climate change, and this was discernible even for those events strongly influenced by the 2015 El Ni\u00f1o. Furthermore, many papers in this year's report demonstrate that attribution science is capable of separating the effects of natural drivers including the strong 2015 El Ni\u00f1o from the influences of long-term human-induced climate change. Other event types investigated include cold winters, tropical cyclone activity, extreme sunshine in the United Kingdom, tidal flooding, precipitation, drought, reduced snowpack in the U.S. mountain west, arctic sea ice extent, and wildfires in Alaska. Two studies investigated extreme cold waves and monthly-mean cold conditions over eastern North America during 2015, and find these not to have been symptomatic of human-induced climate change. Instead, they find the cold conditions were caused primarily by internally generated natural variability. One of these studies shows winters are becoming warmer, less variable, with no increase in daily temperature extremes over the eastern United States. Tropical cyclone activity was extreme in 2015 in the western North Pacific (WNP) as measured by accumulated cyclone energy (ACE). In this report, a study finds that human-caused climate change largely increased the odds of this extreme cyclone activity season. The 2015 Alaska fire season burned the second largest number of acres since records began in 1940. Investigators find that human-induced climate change has increased the likelihood of a fire season of this severity. Confidence in results and ability to quickly do an attribution analysis depend on the \"three pillars\" of event attribution: the quality of the observational record, the ability of models to simulate the event, and our understanding of the physical processes that drive the event and how they are being impacted by climate change. A result that does not find a role for climate change may be because one or more of these three elements is insufficient to draw a clear conclusion. As these pillars are strengthened for different event types, confidence in the presence and absence of a climate change influence will increase. This year researchers also link how changes in extreme event risk impact human health and discomfort during heat waves, specifically by looking at the role of climate change on the wet bulb globe temperature during a deadly heat wave in Egypt. This report reflects a growing interest within the attribution community to connect attribution science to societal impacts to inform risk management through \"impact attribution.\" Many will watch with great interest as this area of research evolves in the coming years. In the first years of this report, we answered questions such as: \"What is event attribution?\" and \"Is it even possible to address the effects of long-term changes on extreme events using event attribution?\" The science has now advanced to the point that we can detect the effects of climate change on some events with high confidence (e.g., especially those linked to temperature), although results are necessarily probabilistic and not deterministic. The growing popular interest in event-attribution is feeding back to the science, for example by requiring it to more carefully consider the impacts of various interpretations and framings of the causation question. We thus now ask: \"What is the confidence of the results?\" and \"How should the results be interpreted?\" We are conscious of the importance of the precise question being asked, for instance \"What are long-term contributions to event frequency?\" versus \"What are long-term contributions to event intensity?\" (e.g., Dole et al. 2011). There remains an ongoing need to reconcile attribution results pertaining to different aspects of extreme event behavior (e.g., Otto et al. 2012). To state that event attribution is complex, especially for extreme rainfall and related storm systems including tropical cyclones, is obvious. Yet, such complexities mean that the analytic work to pull numerous pieces together to establish probable cause continues to require considerable time, even as computers become more powerful to aid the effort. Thus, the reliability and realism of \"real time\" attribution for which there is great public appetite, continues to be an open question. The scope of information demand is also multifaceted, not only to explain \"why the event happened,\" but also \"how well the event was anticipated.\" These new questions are far more challenging to address and are increasingly relevant to the concerns of society. Attribution science has made progress in answering these questions, though considerably more work needs to be done. This last year has been exciting for attribution science, as the U.S. National Academy of Sciences released its report on the topic (NAS 2016). To date, it is the most comprehensive look at the state of event attribution science, including how the framing of attribution questions impacts the results. For example, in a complex event such as drought, a study of precipitation versus a study of temperature may yield different results regarding the role of climate change. The report also addresses how attribution results are presented, interpreted, and communicated. It provides the most robust description to date of the various methodologies used in event attribution and addresses the issues around both the confidence of the results and the current capabilities of near-real time attribution. No single methodology exists for the entire field of event attribution, and each event type must be examined individually. Confidence in results of an attribution analysis depends on what has been referred to as the \"three pillars\" of event attribution: the quality of the observational record, the ability of models to simulate the event, and our understanding of the physical processes that drive the event and how they are being impacted by climate change. A recently published paper (Mitchell et al. 2016) marks the beginning of an important new undertaking for the event attribution field by providing an example of how to apply event attribution science to understanding and preparing for impacts. For many years, the scientific community has discussed linking event attribution to the impacts of these events and the role climate change has played in altering those impacts. This year, for the first time, attribution scientists partnered with public health officials to assess the role climate change played in increased mortality from a specific event-the 2003 European heatwave (Mitchell et al. 2016). Their results concluded that in the summer of 2003, \"out of the estimated ~315 and ~735 summer deaths directly"}, {"section_title": "S2", "text": "DECEMBER 2016 | attributed to the heatwave event in Greater London and Central Paris, respectively, 64 (\u00b1 3) deaths were attributable to anthropogenic climate change in London, and 506 (\u00b1 51) in Paris.\" While the numbers for this heat wave are noteworthy, especially for Paris, the paper makes a larger contribution than just its analysis of the 2003 event. It lays out a methodology for linking the role of climate change on an extreme heat event and, subsequently, the impacts of that event on human health. Clearly, multiple approaches could be taken to address these questions, and the paper by Mitchell et al. lays out just one. Also, it is no accident that this work addresses a heat event, where the climate change signal is strongest and confidence in attribution results is highest. Even so, it would be premature to regard this result-that 506 (\u00b1 51) deaths in Paris in summer 2003 are attributable to anthropogenic climate change-as the last word on the matter. Unquantified uncertainties need to be further explored owing to different observational, modeling, and methodological strategies for both climate attribution and health sciences. And the confidence with which a linkage can be made between anthropogenic emissions and impacts is different for other event types. However, as the science advances we hope to see more papers connecting a line between climate change and impacts, not only for heat but also for other event types. Friederike Otto put it well in a recent paper where she wrote, \"The event attribution community has come a long way towards applying different methodologies and combining meteorological variables to indices of relevance to people, making impact attribution the challenge for the coming years\" (Otto 2016). Mitchell's paper begins to address this challenge. Meaningful connections between weather and climate events and impacts will require that the event attribution community collaborate with the impacts community. Furthermore, event attribution would be most useful to the impacts community if potential users engage closely with scientists in the co-production of knowledge relevant to decisionmaking. The European Climate and Weather Events: Interpretation and Attribution (EUCLEIA) project has engaged with such stakeholders and found that different sectors often have different uses for such information and different requirements (Stott et al. 2015). For example, the insurance industry may value robustness over speed in the assessment of climate risks. By contrast, the World Weather Attribution project has worked with Red Cross/Red Crescent "}, {"section_title": "S3", "text": "DECEMBER 2016 AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY | which require information on faster time scales. They find value in rapid assessments of recent disastrous weather and climate events during the relatively short window of opportunity when resources may be available to enable communities to become more resilient to such shocks in the future (https://www .climatecentral.org/about/partners/). A common characteristic for all these impact attribution efforts is that they have been cross disciplinary. In support of the IPCC's 1.5\u00b0C impacts report, collaborations between science disciplines have been established that will hopefully continue to increase the applicability of event attribution science in decision-making. In addition to the literature, Mother Nature also made this year an interesting one because of the strong El Ni\u00f1o. Although we had anticipated that we would focus on event types other than heat in this year's report, the heat proposals we received put an interesting twist on the heat attribution question. With the presence of a strong El Ni\u00f1o in 2015, these papers asked whether attribution could effectively disentangle the effects of El Ni\u00f1o from longer-term human-caused warming. Without exception, the analyses in this report were successfully able to do this. All investigations of heat events found an increased risk from human-caused climate change separate from the role of El Ni\u00f1o and other drivers from natural variability. As we look back at five years of this BAMS Explaining Extreme Events from a Climate Perspective report, we are excited to see the overall progress made to date. That progress is not merely in the climate science, but also in the growth of capabilities to share that information with others and to communicate that knowledge clearly. Also, the range of event types being examined with a focus on attribution has broadened over the years, and the ability of analyses to distinguish between natural and human-caused drivers continues to increase. It is also worth noting that this publication does not discriminate between papers that do and do not find a role for climate change. A large number of papers published in this report over the past five years (~35%) did not find any role for climate change on the risk of the event, and we expect to continue receiving and publishing similarly-themed manuscripts in the future. Looking ahead, over the next half decade there is certainly a great deal of work still to be done in improving the reliability of event attribution results and how they are communicated. We will be closely watching to see how the effort to meet the challenge of \"impact attribution\" advances in the coming years. We are seeing the start of bridges being built between the disciplines of climate attribution, the practice of weather forecasting, and socioeconomic science, which are each truly essential next steps in using attribution analysis to inform risk management decisions. However, progress in managing risks from extreme events can only be made if the foundational pillars of observations, modeling, and our understanding of the physical processes that drive extreme events and their relationship to climate change also continue to improve. Continued investments in climate science at all levels are crucial not only in the next five years, but for the foreseeable future.

Mitchell, D., and Coauthors, 2016 Figs. 2.1a,b,e). In this analysis, we consider only grid boxes with at least 100 years of historical data, which narrows the focus mainly to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, the North Pacific Ocean, Europe, the United States, southern Asia, and Australia (Fig. 2.1d). Sixteen percent of this analyzed area experienced record annual warmth during 2015 ( Fig. 2.1d). Observed global temperatures over the past decade had been warming at a rate less than the ensemble mean warming in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 all-forcing historical runs (CMIP5-ALL; Taylor et al. 2012). However, the record global temperature of 2015 ( Fig. 2.1e), including the influence of a strong El Ni\u00f1o event (Fig. 2.1f), was warmer globally than the mean of the CMIP5-ALL model ensemble levels for 2015, relative to their respective 1881-1920 means. Major regions with unprecedented annual mean warmth in 2015 included the northeast Pacific and northwest Atlantic, while during September-November (SON) 2015, southern India/Sri Lanka stood out with record seasonal warmth ( Fig. 2.1g; our region of focus in southern India and Sri Lanka does include some SST influence, as we used the combined SST/Tair dataset; see Supplemental Material). Only a small region south of Greenland (0.2% of the globe) experienced record annual mean cold surface temperatures (Fig. 2.1d). We constructed our regions of focus based on areas highlighted in Fig. 2.1d. These regions had some irregular shapes and were constructed to be mostly covered by new record annual or seasonal temperatures in 2015. In addition to global mean temperatures, we focused on two main regions and temporal domains-the Ni\u00f1o-4 region (annual means) and a region including southern India and Sri Lanka (SON means). To demonstrate the robustness for annual mean record warmth in 2015 over the Ni\u00f1o-4 region (Fig. 2.1g), we also showed extended reconstructed sea surface temperature (ERSST.v4; Huang et al. 2016) and Hadley Centre sea ice and sea surface temperature (HadISST1.1;  data reconstructions and found that these also show unprecedented annual mean warmth during 2015. This study investigates the causes of these record warm events using an eight-model set of all-forcing (anthropogenic + natural) historical climate model runs, associated long-term control (unforced) runs, and natural forcing runs (CMIP5-ALL, -CONT, and -NAT, respectively). These eight models (listed in Supplemental Material) were selected, as they were the ones with CMIP5-NAT runs extending to 2012. Our methods follow the studies of Knutson et al. (2013 and; some of the descriptive text below is drawn from those reports. Time-evolving trend analyses for long-term global and regional anthropogenic warming. Figures 2.2a-c show analyses for long-term global and regional trends using different start years, but with a common end year (2012 for CMIP5-NAT and 2015 for CMIP5-ALL; the latter are extended with simulations forced by the RCP4.5 emissions scenario). Observed trends ending in 2012 and 2015 are shown for comparison. In 2015, record warm surface temperatures were observed for the global mean, India, and the equatorial central Pacific. CMIP5 simulations suggest that for the globe and India, anthropogenic warming was largely to blame."}, {"section_title": "S5", "text": "DECEMBER 2016 AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY | For the sliding trends, we require at least 33% areal coverage in the region for at least the start year of the trend (Knutson et al. 2013), resulting in the gaps shown. The global mean analysis shows a pronounced observed warming, consistent with CMIP5-ALL yet statistically distinct from CMIP5-NAT, for all start years before about 1990. While the CMIP5-ALL runs occasionally are inconsistent with observed global trends through 2012 (at least for recent trends beginning in the 1990s), now that the record has been extended to 2015, we find that CMIP5-ALL trends beginning in the late 1990s now are generally consistent with observations. For the Ni\u00f1o-4 region (Fig. 2.2b), we compare results from three different observational datasets. The ERSST.v4 shows the strongest indication of a detectable warming, consistent with the CMIP5-ALL runs but inconsistent with the CMIP5-NAT runs for start years up to around 1960. In contrast, the Had-ISST1.1 estimated trends are hardly distinguishable from the CMIP5-NAT runs, and also inconsistent with the CMIP5-ALL runs through most of the period.

Our FAR estimates use the first-(2015) and second-ranked observed positive anomaly as the extreme event thresholds (Fig. 2.2d). For extremely large anomalies, the FAR can be particularly difficult to estimate, as it is based on a ratio of very small areas under the distribution tails (Kam et al. 2015). Therefore we used the secondranked observed anomalies as the threshold values for our primary FAR estimates, as these anomalies are not quite as extreme as the top-ranked ones. According to the HadCRUT4v4, the secondranked anomalies over the globe, southern India/ Sri Lanka, and the Ni\u00f1o-4 region occurred in 2014, 2010, and 1888, respectively, while the ERSST.v4 and HadISST1.1 datasets show the second-ranked anomalies over the Ni\u00f1o-4 region occurred in different years (2002 and 1987, respectively). Based on the HadCRUT4v4, the simulated probabilities of exceeding the second-ranked anomalies for the globe, southern India/Sri Lanka, and the Ni\u00f1o-4 region are 58% (0.005%), 23% (0.3%), and 32% (1.5%) for the CMIP5-ALL (CMIP5-NAT) runs, respectively. Sensitivity tests for the Ni\u00f1o-4 region using the second-ranked anomalies from the ERSST.v4 and HadISST1.1 datasets are consistent with the results from the HadCRUT4v4 (not shown). The FAR estimates are 0.99, 0.98, and 0.95 for the globe, southern India/Sri Lanka (SON), and the Ni\u00f1o-4 regions, respectively. Uncertainties in the FAR estimates were explored by computing the spread of FAR estimates across individual CMIP5 models (Fig. 2.2d). These sensitivity tests show that, using the second-ranked year threshold values, the estimated FAR is above 0.9 for seven, five, and five out of eight individual models for the globe, Ni\u00f1o-4 region, and southern India/Sri Lanka, respectively (See Supplemental Material). A crucial assumption of our study is that the internal variability simulated by the models represents the real-world variability adequately. The modeled variability is used as the null hypothesis for explaining trends, and if it is underestimated (overestimated) this makes it too easy (difficult) to detect significant trends and too difficult (easy) for model simulations to be consistent with observations (Knutson et al. 2013). Therefore, we evaluated the decadal variability of temperature anomalies over the Ni\u00f1o-4 region by comparing a derived observed variability with CMIP5 control run variability. Variability comparisons for other regions have been previously summarized in Knutson et al. (2013), and plots similar to Fig. 2.2e for global temperature and the southern India/Sri Lanka region are shown in the supplemental material. To isolate the decadal variability, we apply a lowpass filter with a half-power point at nine years. For the observed internal variability temperature estimate, we subtracted the grand ensemble mean of the CMIP5-ALL runs from observations to attempt to remove the forced component of the observed variations. We have not adjusted the forced component estimate to better fit the observations as done in Mann et al. (2014) and Steinmann et al. (2015), which would be a further refinement beyond the scope of this study. As a sensitivity test for Ni\u00f1o-4, we compared the modeled variability (8 GCMs shown in Fig. 2.2e and 23 GCMs in the Supplemental Materials) with that estimated from three different observational datasets. To estimate the model internal variability, we compute the temperature anomaly variance using each model's entire control run. Details for these calculations, and control run lengths used, are described in Knutson et al. (2013). The eight GCM control runs show a wide range of the simulated decadal variances, between 0.025\u00b0 and 0.08\u00b0C 2 . The analogous estimates of the unforced component of the variance from the observational reanalyses are 0.048\u00b0C 2 (ERSST.v4) and 0.051\u00b0C 2 (HadCRUT4v4), both of which are located near the center of the intermodel histogram of the control run decadal variances, while the HadISST1.1 shows a somewhat larger decadal variance (0.068\u00b0C 2 ) which is greater than that from five of the eight models. The sensitivity tests for observed decadal variances, and our earlier sliding trend analyses, indicate that for the Ni\u00f1o-4 region, observational uncertainties significantly obscure the detection and attribution of past trends or recent extreme events. Conclusions. For 2015, the tendency for a greater ratio of global area covered by extreme annual-mean warm versus cold events, as seen in recent decades, has continued. According to the CMIP5 models, the risk of events exceeding the extreme (first-or secondranked) thresholds for the globe, the Ni\u00f1o-4 region, and southern India/Sri Lanka is almost entirely attributable to anthropogenic forcing, with the ensemble mean FAR above 0.9, and with strong agreement regarding relatively high FAR estimates among the eight GCMs that provided natural-forcing simulations. The strongest model-based evidence for detectable long-term anthropogenic warming, and the highest confidence in a large fraction of attributable risk, was found for the global mean and southern India/ Introduction. Three extreme rainfall events occurred over the contiguous United States in 2015 associated with damages in excess of $1 billion (U.S. dollars): 1 1) drought-ending May rains and flash floods in Texas 1,2,3 and surrounding states , 2) near land-falling Hurricane Joaquin in early October associated with catastrophic f looding in South Carolina, 1 , 4 and 3) unseasonable December rains that inundated the Mississippi basin. 1,5 Recognizing the a posteriori nature of case study selections, we present a large-scale assessment of extreme daily rainfall events (\u2265 20-yr return threshold exceedances) over the entire contiguous United States during 2015. Our evaluation facilitates broader discussions on heavy daily precipitation by placing the 2015 high-impact events into both a national and historical context. The contiguous United States has experienced a statistically significant upward trend in heavy precipitation over the last century (e.g., Karl et al. 1995;Groisman et al. 2004Groisman et al. , 2005Kunkel et al. 2012Kunkel et al. , 2013. Much of the long-term increase has occurred during recent decades, consistent with early modeling evidence that heavy precipitation events increase in response to doubled CO 2 (e.g., Noda and Tokioka 1989;Gregory and Mitchell 1995;Cubasch et al. 1995;Mearns et al. 1995), a finding confirmed also in mod-1 www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/events 2 ww.wired.com/2015/05/texas-floods-big-ended-states-drought/ 3 http://today.tamu.edu/2015/11/04/historic-rains-pound-texas -and-more-may-be-coming 4 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2015_North_American _storm_complex/ 5 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_December_2015_North _American_storm_complex els used for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AR5 (IPCC 2013). Here we discuss U.S. aggregate occurrences of extreme daily rainfall events observed in 2015 compared to century-long trends. While not providing an attribution of impacts by human-induced climate change, the history of extreme daily rainfall since 1901 offers insight into whether such events could have been anticipated from a long-term change perspective of altered likelihoods. We specifically ask whether 2015 recorded an unusual frequency of extreme daily rainfall over the United States as a whole. And, we ask if the regionality and seasonality characterizing 2015 extreme daily rainfall events were consistent with corresponding attributes of long-term trends. Data and Methods. We utilize 987 meteorological stations extracted from GHCN-D (Menne et al. 2012) having at least 100 years of nonmissing daily observations during 1901-2014, as well as mostly complete data in 2015. While the coverage is not homogenous, it is much more complete than outside the United States, rendering a global analysis more problematic. Two extreme indices, RX1day (max 1-day precipitation) and R99p (extremely wet days), as defined by Sillmann et al. (2013), are computed at each station for all annual cases (base period 1901-80). The RX1day index is calculated for bimonthly seasons as well. We applied the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution, known as the block or annual maxima approach for analysis of 20-yr precipitation events (e.g., Coles 2001;Ferreira and de Haan 2015), using the Matlab NEVA package (Cheng et al. 2014), and described further in the Supplemental Material. We validated these results against the empirical estimates of the 20-yr events by ranking the annual and seasonal maxima at each station. About 90% of the empirical estimates lie within the 95% credible interval of the 20-yr return levels estimated using the Bayesian-GEV approach, reassuring the robustness The United States experienced above-normal daily rainfall extremes in 2015, consistent with national upward trends. However, the most abundant regional extremes were not foreshadowed by co-located long-term seasonal trends."}, {"section_title": "S10", "text": "DECEMBER 2016 | of our results. This is important since there is considerable variability across the United States in terms of the shape of daily precipitation distributions, in particular its tails (Kharin and Zwiers 2005;Cavanaugh et al. 2015). The lower confidence bounds (2.5th percentile) of the GEV-estimated return level for 20-yr events are applied in order to include all cases that might be considered of that intensity. To provide long-term climate context, we refer to NCEI's national to global mean temperature time series, 62 as well as the extended Multivariate ENSO Index 7,8 (Wolter and Timlin 2011). Results. a. National Scale-Annual Highlights. During 2015, the contiguous United States had its third wettest year since 1895. 6 This was anchored by record wetness in portions of the Great Plains, 6 but counterbalanced by California's fourth consecutive drought year (Fig. 3.1a). Consistent with the overall wetness, 143 of 910 reporting stations in 2015 registered daily 20-yr events, or 15.7% (Fig. 3.1b). This 20-yr event coverage of daily extremes was the fifth highest on record (Fig. 3.2a), consistent with a long-term upward trend that has clustered all five most extreme years after 1989. Our time series of national coverage (Fig. 3.2a) correlates at +0.54 (0.53) with the global (Northern Hemisphere) surface temperature time series for 1901-2014, consistent with previous results (e.g., Kunkel et al. 2013), compared to +0.21 with just the U.S. temperature time series. 6 Removal of linear trends in all time series lowers these correlations to +0.27 (0.27) and \u22120.02, respectively, showing a rather modest linkage between year-to- The long-term average  coverage of such extreme rainfall events is around 9% during each season.

The third highest coverage occurred in September-October (13.6% in Fig. 3.1g), due to the aforementioned South Carolina flooding in early October, as well as yet another record-breaking wet month (October) in and around Texas, 3 both analyzed further in the supplemental material. The remaining seasons January-February, March-April, and July-August (Figs. 3.1c,d, f ) did not feature exceptional coverage nor any $1 billion flooding disasters.

Prior to our analysis, this relationship has been mainly studied for the winter season (e.g., Feldl and Roe 2011;Cannon 2015). During that season, El Ni\u00f1o appears to increase the likelihood of the most extreme daily totals for much of the contiguous United States Cannon 2015), but with notable exceptions (see in particular Feldl and Roe 2011, for the southwestern United States).

Regional Scale-The Two Most Extreme Events. For the Texas/Oklahoma region (see outline in Fig. 3.1e), we document the historical 20-yr daily extreme rainfall fractional coverage for annual and May-June data in Figs. 3.2b and 3.2c, respectively. The annual event analysis reveals 2015 to be the most extreme year on record (33.7% of all stations reporting in this region), consistent with a significant (r = 0.31) upward trend for 1901-2014, as well as a modest positive correlation with the extended multivariate ENSO index (MEI; r = 0.24). The May-June analysis indicates the tally of daily extremes (29.5%) did not quite reach the record set in 1908 (35.3%). Furthermore, the annual trend is not symptomatic of that season's negligible trend preceding neither the 2015 spring nor a noteworthy correlation with the seasonal MEI (both < 0.2). The abundance of extreme spring rain events would thus not have been anticipated from a historical perspective, though for the year as a whole more extreme rainfall events than the 1901-80 mean could have been expected. For the central U.S. region (see outline in Fig.   3.1h), we document the historical 20-yr daily extreme coverage for annual and November-December events, in Figs. 3.2d and e, respectively. The annual coverage for this region is high in 2015 (ranked 8th), matching a significant long-term trend that also correlates at +0.45 with the 1901-2014 global annual temperature time series, as well as a modest relationship with ENSO (r = 0.25). The November-December coverage registered at an astonishing 47%, far above the previous record for this season in 1909. This recordsetting number of 20-yr events was not preceded by a significant upward trend. Nor does the historical time series of extreme rainfall events exhibit a significant relationship with the MEI (both < 0.2). Thus, one could again view this event as a \"climate surprise\" not obviously related to the two most important climate drivers examined here."}, {"section_title": "Discussion and", "text": "Conclusions. In answer to our introduction's first question, 2015 experienced a high frequency of extreme daily rainfall events over the contiguous United States, consistent with a well-known national upward trend (e.g., Fischer and Knutti 2014;Hoerling et al. 2016), ending up in the top 5 of all years since 1901. This elevated number of occurrences in 2015 appears unusual only when viewed in the context of a stationary climate. However, it was not that unusual if one considers the upward trend that relates strongly to global mean temperatures, and the fact that 9 out of the top 10 years of most extensive extreme daily rainfall event coverage occurred since 1990. Not only is the longterm trend of such events upwards, the spatial pattern of 2015 extremes is congruent with trend maps for 1901-2014 (c = 0.56; Supplemental Fig. S3.1). Though no formal attribution was done, an interpretation that climate change forcing is likely a major contributor to the upward trend in U.S. extreme daily rainfall events, and thus likely also contributed to its high count in 2015, is consistent with the body of literature cited in the introduction. That relation also appears more compelling as a causal effect for the outcome in 2015 than the occurrence of a strong El Ni\u00f1o event. In answer to the introduction's second question, neither of the two most remarkable extreme events that occurred in May and December over Texas/Oklahoma and the central United States, respectively (each linked to $1 billion disasters), were foreshadowed by any obvious seasonal upward trend in extreme daily rainfall. While both the greater Texas and central U.S. regions have upward trends in the annual tallies of 20-yr daily rainfall extremes, those events have tended to occur in other seasons. The least anticipated event, from a perspective of the region's climate time series of extreme rainfall might very well have been the October South Carolina flood that came about despite no prior seasonal or annual trends (Supplemental Fig. S3.2)."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.", "text": "Two anonymous reviews helped to improve our manuscript.

Despite a below normal end-of-winter snowpack and an unseasonably warm spring with earlier snowmelt, which dried fuels early in the season, scattered showers and cool temperatures kept 2015 fire activity near normal through early June. During the first half of June, several days of maximum temperatures exceeded 30\u02daC, relative humidity (RH) values were in the teens, and long daylight hours quickly dried surface and subsurface (duff) forest-floor fuels.\nThis research was supported primarily by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, under the Climate Test Bed program (NA14OAR4310187).

Although the winter yielded a persistent, strong positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) 1 , a wavy structure over NA prevailed in February 2015 as shown in Fig. 8.1b for the geopotential height at 500 hPa. The anomaly started to develop in the troposphere in January but intensified and became more meridional in February, concomitant with a strengthening of the polar vortex (Supplemental Fig. S8.2). We investigate in this article the potential drivers of both the surface cold anomaly and the anomalous meander of the jet stream in 2015 using an index which measures the meridional wind component at 500 hPa averaged over central North America (CAN; black box in Fig. 8.1b and time-series Supplemental Fig. S8.1). Although these atmospheric conditions may be part of the natural atmospheric variability, their recurrence during the last decade is striking (Francis and Vavrus 2012), and recent studies have proposed mechanisms to explain its prevalence. The most debated cause points toward the Arctic amplification and the associated accelerated Arctic sea ice retreat (Overland et al. 2015). Reduced sea ice concentration (SIC) leads to strong heat release from the ocean that could modify the meridional temperature gradient and, thus, alter the jet stream and sea level pressure patterns at midlatitudes (e.g., Cohen et al. 2014). A direct, local atmospheric response to the Arctic surface warming could also force anticyclonic circulation anomalies at the surface and project onto a wave-like structure at mid-upper-tropospheric levels (Kug et al. 2015). February 2015 Arctic sea ice conditions depicted in Fig. 8.1c show the third lowest extent since 1979.

The common perception of drab British winters is seemingly challenged by the increasing trend of 2.4 \u00b1 0.7 sunshine hrs decade \u22121 (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) during 1930-2015 ( Fig. 10.1a). With winters in the region projected to become warmer and wetter in a changing climate (van Oldenborgh et al. 2013), increasing sunshine would suggest longer sunny spells between heavier rainfall events. Brighter winters may also enhance solar energy production. Annual sunshine over western Europe was found to follow periods of dimming in the 1960-80s and brightening thereafter, while large positive seasonal trends are particularly evident in winter (Sanchez-Lorenzo et al. 2008). Contrary to the changes in Europe, a sunshine decline in recent decades has been observed in parts of the world where aerosol concentrations have been increasing, such as China and the Indian subcontinent (Wang et al. 2012;Liao et al. 2015;Niroula et al. 2015). We attempt to formally establish the role of the overall anthropogenic forcing on the climate based on ensembles of simulations with and without anthropogenic effects produced with an atmospheric model. This well-established methodology (Pall et al. 2011;Christidis et al. 2013) provides distributions of climatic variables in the actual (ALL forcings) and natural (NAT) climate, constructed with the two ensembles. Probabilities P 1 and P 0 of a threshold exceedance computed with the ALL and NAT simulations help assess the anthropogenic effect in terms of the fraction of attributable risk (FAR;, defined as 1 \u2212 (P 0 / P 1 ). FAR values close to unity indicate prominent human influence on the event. Changes in the return time of extreme events (estimated from inverse probabilities) can also be examined.\nWe appreciate the primary editor and other anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and suggestions.

Stone Barlow and Hoell 2015), and combined with political tensions, the recent heat wave could enhance unrest in the region (Schleussner et al. 2016). While direct attribution of climate change on mortality is possible (Mitchell et al. 2016a), the required observed mortality data are not easily obtained in this specific region. As such, the attribution study is performed on the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), a proxy for human discomfort. Note that Mitchell et al. (2016a) used a different heat stress metric, apparent temperature, because this could be used directly with the health impact assessment (HIA) model they employed. As this study does not use a HIA model, the WBGT is chosen so the study can be contrasted with a recent climate predictions study (Pal and Eltahir 2015). A comparison of the two different heat stress metrics is given in Willett and Sherwood (2012). Methods. The WBGT is estimated using the following equation (Fischer and Knutti 2012): WBGT = 0.567T + 0.393e + 3.94 The water vapor pressure, e = f(T, RH), can be approximated using a derivation of the Magnus formula (Sonntag 1990;Sippel and Otto 2014), where the terms T and RH are temperature and relative humidity, respectively, and are available from model output and from the Met Office Integrated Data Archive System (MIDAS; Met Office 2012) station data. This study focuses on Egypt as a whole, but a subanalysis is also performed for Cairo (the most populated city in Egypt). A map of the station locations is given in Fig. 14.1a with Cairo marked in red. Event attribution is performed using the weather@ home framework, which comprises a global atmosphere-only driving model (HadAM3P; Massey et al. 2015) and a 50-km regional model covering northern Africa and the Middle East (the setup is identical to Bergaoui et al. 2015). Approximately 2000 simulations of 2015 are run using perturbed initial conditions (actual scenario) and compared with ~2000 simulations estimating a naturalized version of 2015 (natural scenario). The natural simulations employ solar and volcanic forcings fixed at 2015 levels with all other forcings set to preindustrial values. However, the actual scenarios employ all forcings at 2015 levels, which include the aforementioned natural forcings as well as greenhouse gases, aerosols, and land use. The model is spun up for 2 years before 2015 to equilibrate long-memory processes in the Earth-atmosphere system. The natural scenario simulations include 10 estimates of possible natural sea surface temperatures (SSTs), which are estimated using coupled oceanatmosphere models . The model simulations are interpolated to each of the different station locations. Results. The observed WBGT over Egypt (i.e., the average of all stations) is shown by the black line A combined modeling and observational assessment of the 2015 heat wave in Egypt found that human discomfort increased due to anthropogenic climate change.\nThe station rainfall data (since 1969) provided by IMD is acknowledged.

In 2015, the prerainy season began in early May, about a month later than normal. After the rainbelt was established, the rainfall was exceptionally heavy with the total precipitation in some southern provinces more than 50% greater than the 1971-2000 average (CMA 2016). The rain fell in a series of heavy storms, causing severe flooding in many cities with impacts that included loss of life. We examine the change in the character of rainfall during May in terms of the number of consecutive days of rain, total rainfall over a period of n days (nday totals), and rainfall intensity. Using these metrics, we estimate the regional change in probability of extreme precipitation due to anthropogenic climate forcing. Data. We use model data from a pair of multidecadal ensemble experiments using the latest Met Office HadGEM3-A-based attribution system. Each ensemble comprises 15 members spanning the period 1960-2013, one set with both anthropogenic and natural forcings (ALL) and the other with natural only (NAT). The system is an upgrade to that used in a number of previous studies described by Christidis et al. (2013) to higher resolution (N216 L85, 0.56\u00b0 x 0.83\u00b0 horizontally), the latest operational dynamical core (ENDGame; Wood and Stainforth 2010), and land surface model (JULES; Best et al. 2011), as well as an updated forcings set consistent with the CMIP5 generation (Jones et al. 2011). Members differ from one another solely through the stochastic physics and share atmospheric initialization from ERA-40 at 0000 UTC 1 December 1959. We use observed daily precipitation data for 1961-2015 provided by the Climate Data Center of China National Meteorological Information Center (NMIC). This dataset uses quality controlled data from 2419 stations and is the best daily dataset available for climate study in China. Yang and Li (2014) show that most of the daily precipitation series are homogeneous and lack pronounced discontinuities resulting from instrumental changes or station relocation. Methods. We divide the f lood-affected area of southeast China into 12 regions of 3\u00b0 \u00d7 3\u00b0 areas with spatially coherent rainfall patterns and variability. Region locations and corresponding time series of total monthly rainfall for May are shown in Fig.  18.1. Monthly totals show no clear trends outside of interannual variability (see Supplemental Material for linear fits).There is also no clear separation of expected changes in monthly rainfall under anthropogenic and natural forcings. Given the large interannual variability of monthly totals and the nature of the floods in May 2015 being related to several large daily rainfall totals, we instead look at changes in intensity and duration of rainfall events. For the month of May, we count the number of consecutive wet days (daily total rainfall >= 1 mm) (n_days) and record the total rainfall during each n-day event (n_day_tot). We then calculate the mean intensity of rainfall in mm day \u22121 for each event (intens). Using this metric, any given month can have several rainfall events. For each 3\u00b0 \u00d7 3\u00b0 region in southeast China, the mean of the observed station data and the mean of the grid cells for the model data are calculated for each day. This daily area-mean for each region is then used to calculate n_days, n_day_tot, and intens. We Anthropogenic climate change increased the probability that a short-duration, intense rainfall event would occur in parts of southeast China. This type of event occurred in May 2015, causing serious flooding.\nThe authors have been supported by funding from the Australian Research Council's Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science (Grant CE110001028).

El Ni\u00f1o together with a positive IOD is typically associated with warm conditions over Australia during September to November (White et al. 2013), although the influence from El Ni\u00f1o becomes more important later in the year. While seasonally varying oceanic conditions favored warm conditions across Australia, on the intraseasonal time scale many atmospheric features also favored warm conditions during October 2015 (see details on the climate state on the POAMA-2 pages at http://poama.bom.gov.au/). In spring, negative southern annular mode (SAM;Marshall 2003), phase 2 and 3 of the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO; Wheeler and Hendon 2004) and blocking in the Tasman Sea are all associated with warm conditions across southern Australia (Marshall et al. 2013;Hendon et al. 2007). During October 2015, the subtropical ridge was intense, associated with blocking over the Tasman Sea as indicated by the subtropical ridge index (STRHI;Marshall et al. 2013), which was greater than two standard deviations above the mean in the first half of the month. The SAM varied through the month, but was negative during two periods of strong heat, in the first week and again around 20 October. From 23 October through the end of the month, the MJO became moderate to strong in Phase 2. The combination of these climatic features would be expected to bring heat to southern Australia."}, {"section_title": "S14", "text": "Beginning June 19, a period of vigorous thunderstorm activity resulted in an unprecedented weeklong lightning event with 36 000 strikes in three days. During this period, 65 000+ strikes in Alaska gave rise to nearly 270 ignitions of the preconditioned fuels. Burned acreage increased by 3.8 million acres (Fig. 4.1b) in the two and a half weeks following those starts ( Fig. 4.1c). Lightning ignitions caused 99.5% of the acreage burned in Alaska in 2015. A westerly shift in upper-level winds by mid-July brought cool and damp weather that curtailed fire growth, and most extant fires burned little acreage after July 15. This pattern highlights a significant difference between Alaska's top two fire seasons: 2004 burned significant acreage in July and again in August during extended warm and dry late summer weather, while 2015 saw the bulk of fire activity concentrated from mid-June to mid-July. These different pathways to large fire seasons demonstrate the importance of intraseasonal weather variability and the timing of dynamical features. Yet, underlying each case are the common requirements of: heat, extremely dry fuels, and ignition. One question that arises is whether the extremely warm and dry, yet convective, conditions of 2015 might be driven by anthropogenic climate change. This attribution study is a model-based test of the hypothesis that anthropogenic climate change increases the likelihood of fire seasons as extreme as 2015 through increasing flammability of fuels. Measuring Fire Risk through the Buildup Index. This assessment uses the Buildup Index (BUI; Lawson and Armitage 2008), which is part of the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System's Fire Weather Index system and represents potential fuel availability and flammability, based on cumulative scoring of daily temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation. "}, {"section_title": "|", "text": "High BUI values generally represent periods of high fire danger (Ziel et al. 2015). BUI is often derived from meteorological station observations; however, gridded downscaled data (i.e., Bieniek et al. 2016) are used here because observations in Alaska are temporally and spatially spotty. BUI is well suited for describing most fire seasons in northern boreal regions so is widely used by managers in Canada and Alaska. BUI begins to increase after the snowmelt, reaches its peak in June-July, and declines thereafter. Figure 4.2a displays BUI trends (April-September) for the Alaska boreal forest region (<600 m elevation) from 1979-2015. The BUI values represent the number of days (averaged over forest grids) that BUI exceeded 60, which marks the threshold for high fire danger in Alaska (Ziel et al. 2015). As an integrated metric, BUI effectively captures seasonal fire danger in Alaska, as per the large areas burned in 2004, 2015, and 2005. The exception is 2013, which, despite an extremely high BUI, had low fire activity because of few lightning strikes, highlighting ignitions as a necessary prerequisite for fires. Modeling Wildfire Probability in Alaska. The attribution assessment was based on dynamical downscaling over the Alaska region by a regional model, the Advanced Research (ARW) version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model (Skamarock et al. 2008). An optimized configuration of the WRF model physical parameterizations for Alaska  was employed. The downscaling covered a 262 x 262 grid-point domain that encompassed all of Alaska and portions of eastern Russia and northern Canada at 20 km spatial resolution with 49 vertical model levels. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) interim reanalysis (ERA-Interim) data was downscaled for the 1979-2015 historical period (Bieniek et al. 2016), and a 60year downscaling of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Climate Model, version 3 (GFDL CM3) was completed to address the present climate and counterfactual (preindustrial) climate. Specifically, the GFDL CM3 was downscaled using WRF for a 60-year period (1986-2045) centered on 2015 based on historical (1986)(1987)(1988)(1989)(1990)(1991)(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005) and RCP8.5 (2006RCP8.5 ( -2045 simulations from CMIP5. A 60-year subperiod (1986-2045) of a GFDL CM3 prescribed constant CO 2 (280 ppm) and aerosol concentrations (Donner et al. 2011) simulation represented the counterfactual or preindustrial world without anthropogenic climate change.

In nature, Alaska temperatures display a statewide warming of about 1\u00b0C in the annual mean and about 1.5\u00b0C in May-July since 1920; precipitation trends over the same period are mixed (Bieniek et al. 2014; see also NOAA's Climate at a Glance, www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag). Possible reasons for differences in modeled-versus-observed trends in precipitation are discussed in the online supplemental material. The model-derived differences were used to compute two 60-year time series of the BUI averaged over the Alaska boreal region from 1986-2045: one that included the influence of anthropogenic climate change [based on the original downscaled WRF output (i.e., using anthropogenic forcing)] and the other for the preindustrial control [based on the original downscaled WRF output adjusted by the differences between the GFDL monthly means for the two 60year periods (i.e., not using anthropogenic forcing)]. The precipitation adjustment factors were the ratios of the two 60-year means to avoid negative values. The GFDL-derived time series of BUI captures the observed (ERA-Interim) annual variability in BUI shown in Fig. 4.2a (comparison of observed BUI with GFDL BUI values not shown); however, the downscaled GFDL precipitation amounts are generally higher than the downscaled ERA-Interim for 1986-2015. Consequently, the downscaled GFDL BUI values were smaller than those obtained from downscaled ERA-Interim values. Therefore, all GFDL-derived BUI values were multiplied by 2.4, the ratio of the mean ERA-derived BUI for 1986-2015 to the corresponding GFDL-derived mean. This adjustment does not affect the percentile ranks that form the basis of our attribution assessment below. Results. The anthropogenic contribution to the likelihood of a fire season of 2015's severity based on BUI was assessed using the fraction of attributable risk metric National Academies 2016).

With the caveat that it is based on one ensemble member from one climate model, we conclude from this experiment that climate change has increased the risk of a fire year as severe as 2015 by 34%-60%. Several sources of uncertainty are inherent in these estimates of increased risk of a severe fire season in Alaska. First, the sample size of events is small, as the number of fire years more severe than 2015 is 2 and 3 (for a total of 5) in the modeled preindustrial and the modeled present, respectively. Nevertheless, although there may be such uncertainty in the exceedance of the 2015 threshold, the results clearly indicate that the present climate (red line in Fig. 4.2b) has increased the risk of days with BUI > 60 relative to the preindustrial (dark blue line). Second, the results are based on only one model, GFDL CM3 (downscaled using WRF). While the GFDL model is one of the betterperforming global models for Alaska (www.snap.uaf .edu/methods/models), simulated changes of temperature and precipitation since the preindustrial period vary among models. Third, our evaluation focused on an index (the BUI) of climate-driven potential for summer wildfire, not on the shorter-term weather variables of wind, humidity, and temperature that affect the rate of wildfire growth. Sensitivity tests (orange and green lines) shown in Fig. 4.2b highlight the competing effects of temperature and precipitation as climate changes. If precipitation does not change within the model, the postindustrial warming increases the severity of the fire years in the upper half of the distribution (orange line). An increase of precipitation, in the absence of any temperature change, decreases the severity of the uppermost half of the distribution (green line). The impact of increased temperatures outweighs the impact of increased precipitation in the change from the preindustrial. For the future, annual average temperatures in Alaska are projected to increase by 1\u00b0C to 2\u00b0C above present values by 2050, while precipitation is projected to increase by 15%-30% by the end of the century (Chapin et al. 2014)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion.", "text": "The 2015 fire season in Alaska was remarkable for its early-season total acres burned, which resulted from 1) fuel flammability due to the warm and dry conditions of May and June, and 2) lightning-induced ignitions in June. The rains of mid-summer likely prevented a new record for area burned in Alaska in 2015. An attribution analysis indicates that 2015's fuel conditions reached a level that is 34%-60% more likely to occur in today's anthropogenically changed climate than in the past. The major uncertainty in such an attribution assessment is the as-yet unknown relationship between climate change and the major lightning events that ignite widespread fires. This study's conclusion is consistent with the similar finding by  for wildfires in California, where an increased wildfire risk relative to the preindustrial climate emerged in the 1990s. Similar model-derived results were found for the western United States (Luo et al. 2013;Yue et al. 2013), Canada (Flannigan et al. 2015), and Alaska (Young et al. 2016).  (Fig. 5.1a). Unlike past droughts that were mainly caused by precipitation deficits (e.g., the 2005 drought;Anderson et al. 2006), the 2014/15 cold season (November-March) produced near-normal precipitation statewide (Fig. 5.1b). In what has since been nicknamed the \"snowpack drought\" of 2015 (www.ecy.wa.gov/drought/), the drought was more a result of unprecedented warmth ( Fig. 5.1c) that caused cold-season precipitation to fall as rain rather than snow on the mountains. A small change in temperature can alter the water balance by reducing the precipitation falling as snow, which results in declined snow water equivalent and summer streamflow (Mote 2006;Stewart et al. 2004). This 2014/15 situation thereby sets an example for the known effect of atmospheric warming on reducing mountain snowpack in the Pacific Northwest (PNW), a known risk that has been reported by a sizable body of research (e.g., Stoelinga et al. 2010;Mote et al. 2014;Abatzoglou et al. 2014). Reduction in the PNW snowpack also increases the risk of wildfires, the latter of which is evidenced by the remarkable 2015 wildfire season, the largest in the state's history. A Washington Department of Agriculture report (http://agr.wa.gov/FP/Pubs /docs/104-495InterimDroughtReport2015.pdf ) estimates the 2015 drought alone has caused more than $335 million (U.S. dollars) of loss for the state's agricultural industry. In this study, we investigate the role natural climate variability played in the 2015 Washington state drought and situate it in the context of anthropogenic climate change.\nOur time-dependent GEV model disentangles and probabilistically decomposes independent contributions from concurrent processes attributing to the Miami-region floods during 27 September 2015. Seasonal and tide cycles are quite predictable, whereas FC transport variability is less so (e.g., DiNezio et al. 2009). In terms of decadesold infrastructure, two major factors were at play: a 9-cm increase from FC variability and a 10.9-cm rise from a climate-related SLR trend since 1994 of which a fraction (~0.05 cm year \u22121 ) is downward vertical land motion (Zervas et al. 2013;Kopp et al. 2014) common to south Florida. There is a decreasing trend (significant at the 99% level) in monthly minimum FC transport of 2.3 Sv since 1994, which likely contributed ~2 cm to the SLR-related trend (Fig.6.2b, blue line). A decline in the large-scale Gulf Stream transport, which is expected this century (Yin 2012) to exacerbate flooding along the mid-Atlantic (Hall et al. 2016), is not well resolved for the FC locally within the SLR projections (Kopp et al. 2014). Because of this, and since we use a parametric extreme distribution to quantify the transition to a more recurrent event better estimated empirically (Sweet and Park 2014), our flood-frequency projections should be considered conservative underestimates. In closing, flooding on 27 September inundated 0.57 m of normally dry land (~2 feet; https://coast.noaa.gov/slr) and capped a weeklong event in which daily high tides exceeded the local nuisance flood threshold ( Fig. 6.1b). Tidal floods of this magnitude occur only every few years now but will become commonplace in the coming decades. The 2015 winter was the second in a row characterized by extreme cold along the East Coast. These cold events have occurred even while human-related climate change has led to long-term global declines in extreme cold temperatures (Seneviratne et al. 2012). However, global warming has been hypothesized by some to not only shift the temperature distribution toward warmer temperatures, but also to increase the probability of cold extremes in certain regions by enhancing the meandering of the midlatitude jet stream (Francis and Vavrus 2015). Trenary et al. 2015, however, demonstrated that the variance of winter daily temperature along the U.S. eastern seaboard has been decreasing, suggesting a decrease in variability and in the likelihood of cold waves. Decreased variance combined with increasing mean temperatures indirectly indicates a reduction in the likelihood of cold extremes. In this study, we apply extreme value theory to directly quantify the intensity and duration of the eastern U.S. 2015 cold wave and long-term changes in the likelihood of cold extremes.\nIn conclusion, the multimethod analysis applied in this paper provides consistent evidence that human-induced climate change has contributed to the increase in the frequency and intensity of short-term heat waves and heat stress such as the central and eastern Europe 2015 event. However, quantitative estimates of the risk ratio at local scales can differ widely depending on the exact methodologies applied, thus highlighting large method-and data-related uncertainties. In this study, due to the large discrepancy between observed and modeled trends in temperature extremes, the modelestimated probability ratios are lower than those estimated from the observations.  (Fig. 12.1a), the seasonal mean (June-August) surface air temperature (SAT) anomaly was 2.40\u00b0C above the 1964-93 mean: 3.65 standard deviations of the interannual variability. This magnitude of warming is comparable with previous hot summers in Europe, such as 2003 (e.g., Schaer et al. 2004;) and 2010 (e.g., Barriopedro et al. 2011;Otto et al. 2012) when summer mean SAT anomalies over the same region were 2.38\u00b0C and 2.42\u00b0C (3.63 and 3.68 standard deviations), respectively. In addition to the very hot mean SAT, records over central Europe were set for some temperature extremes: the annual hottest day temperature (TXx), seasonal mean daily maximum temperature (Tmax), and diurnal temperature range (DTR) were 4.04\u00b0, 3.04\u00b0, and 1.53\u00b0C above the 1964-93 mean. The 2015 summer extreme hot temperature occurred in the context of a decade of summer warming and increases in hot temperature extremes, and in fact, 2015 was the driest and the second hottest summer in recent decades (Figs. 12.1a,b).\nDuring May 2015, large daily rainfall totals were recorded over much of southeast China. While no clear trends are seen in the monthly total rain for this region, we find that the character of the rainfall has changed, such that the same total amount of rain falls in shorter more intense storms. We have shown that for the month of May, anthropogenically forced climate change has increased the probability of this kind of intense, short-duration rainfall (as occurred in 2015) for some regions of southeast China. In the future, we might expect more occurrences of short, intense rainfall events in these regions, increasing the likelihood of flooding.   (Fig. 19.1a). Maximum daily temperatures (TMX) exceeded 40\u00b0C on a record-breaking number of July days in 50 out of 88 counties in Xinjiang, and historical TMX records were broken in 28 counties. The highest TMX was 47.7\u00b0C in Turpan. This year also smashed the historical records of heat wave duration in 51 counties. Our paper poses three questions: How extreme was the heat in Northwest China in July 2015 in a historical context? What factors led to the record-breaking heat? Did human-induced climate change increase the odds of abnormally high July heat in Xinjiang? Data and methods. We collected the July TMX from National Meteorological Information Center (NMIC; http://data.cma.cn). The NMIC has conducted data quality control, including extreme value control, consistency check, and spatial consistency test (Liu and Li 2003). We used the data at the 53 stations with continuous July TMX records throughout the period of 1961-2015. We defined the extreme threshold as the 90th percentile of area-averaged July TMX between 1961 and 1990 (Mazdiyasni and AghaKouchak 2015). Heat wave duration was defined as the total number of days within July that TMX exceeded the threshold (Meehl and Tebaldi 2004). Simulations from 10 global climate models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 of (CMIP5; Taylor et al. 2012) were used to assess the contribution of human influences on the observed July TMX (Supplemental Table S19.1 for the model list). The simulations driven by preindustrial control setting, natural forcing, all forcings, and anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHG) forcing were assessed. As compared to the usual 2005, these 10 models extend the historical and natural simulations to 2012. However, we focused the GCM simulation analysis on the period 1961-2015 to enable comparison with observations. We used the TMX projection from the Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 (RCP4.5) scenario to extend the time series of all forcings simulations through 2015, similar to Zhou et al. (2014) and . For each GCM, only one member (r1i1p1) run was employed in this study. We used several statistical techniques to assess the severity and causes of the extreme heat: 1) To estimate the univariate return period, we selected the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution for parametric fitting. This allows more stable estimates of return periods for extreme events occurring in the upper tail of the distribution (Fig. 19.1b). We used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) goodnessof-fit test to verify the distribution (Wilks 2006). 2) We focused on the concurrence of July mean TMX anomaly and the duration of the heatwave (Fig.  19.1c). To estimate the concurrent extreme return period, we used the concept of copulas designed to model the dependence between multiple variables (Nelsen 2007). We used the Akaike information criterion (AIC; Akaike 1974) to identify the Gumbel copula as the most appropriate: smaller AIC values indicate a more reliable joint distribution (Supplemental Table S19.2). 3) To evaluate the impact of external forcing, we estimated scaling factors using the regularized optimal fingerprinting (ROF) method (Ribes et al. The record-breaking heat over northwest China in July 2015 was linked directly to atmospheric general circulation indices and anthropogenic forcing. The latter increased the risk of extreme heat by three-fold."}, {"section_title": "S19", "text": "Data and Model Sources. The observed mean surface air temperatures and precipitation were obtained from monthly records of PRISM's high-resolution spatial climate data (https://climatedataguide.ucar .edu). For the analysis of northern Pacific climate variability, NOAA's extended reconstructed sea surface temperature (SST) v4 was used (Huang et al. 2015). Circulation patterns were based on streamfunction (\u03a8) derived from the NCEP-NCAR global wind reanalysis . NCEP's daily two-meter (T 2m ) air temperature dataset (Kristler et al. 2001) and CPC's unified gauge-based analysis of daily precipitation were used for the estimation of snow-precipitation ratio (S/P) and snow frequency (SF); the latter was also used to characterize dry spells following Gillies et al. (2012). Precipitation was fully classified as snow at T 2m \u2264 0\u00b0C. Because the majority of Washington's snowpack is stored in the Cascades, we focused on the cold season of November-March over the mountain ranges outlined in Fig. 5.1a (i.e., all time series were area-averaged from the domain referred to as the Cascades). Historical and future simulations with the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1) (Hurrell et al. 2013) were analyzed to examine external climate forcing to drought variability in the region and to project possible long-term changes. Thirty ensemble members produced by CESM1 with a spatial resolution of 0.9\u00b0 longitude \u00d7 1.25\u00b0 latitude through the Large Ensemble Project (Kay et al. 2015) were used.

The ensemble spread of initial conditions is generated by the commonly used \"round-off differences\" method (Kay et al. 2014). Result and Discussion. To examine the unique combination of high temperatures (T) and nearnormal precipitation (P) experienced in 2014/15, we computed the correlation between observed P and T over the Cascades. The simultaneous correlation between P and T in the past century has been weak (r < 0.1); however, the coherency between P and T appears to fluctuate over time. Figure 5.1d shows the sliding correlation (SCORR) between P and T within various windows ranging from 7 to 21 years, revealing a cyclical pattern in the coherency of P with T on interdecadal timescales. The correlation between P and T was mostly positive during the first third of the century, after which negative correlations prevailed until the late 1970s, then the correlation pattern reversed back to positive. Even though the correlation coefficients are only marginally significant at the peaks and troughs (for the 15-year window the significant SCORR at the 95% interval is .48), the SCORR pattern bears a visual similarity to the low frequency variations within the North Pacific, expressed in Fig. 5.1e by the North Pacific index (NPI; Fig. 5.1e). Calculated from the area-weighted sea level pressure over the region 30\u00b0-65\u00b0N, 160\u00b0E-140\u00b0W, the NPI measures the intensity changes of the Aleutian low, which affects cyclone frequency and passages over the PNW (Trenberth and Hurrell 1994). The SCORR pattern mimics the timing of major shifts in the sign of the NPI; a negative regime from 1947-76, with positives dominating from 1925-46 and from 1977 through the present. Since the NPI and the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) are significantly correlated, the PDO has a similar interdecadal coherence with P and T (not shown). Here, we focus on the NPI because the PDO is deemed an oceanic response to integrated atmospheric forcing (Newman et al. 2016) and, strictly speaking, should not be directly regarded as a climate driver of the PNW. In Supplemental Table S5.1, we list an array of climate indices and their correlation coefficient with the P-T SCORR using the 15-year window, and both the NPI and PDO stand out as being significant at p < 0.01. Next, the weather processes that encompass the NPI regimes and dry spells in the Cascades are examined. An extreme dry spell was defined as a prolonged period of at least 10 days without substantial precipitation accumulation (< 5 mm). As shown in Fig. 5.1e, more and prolonged dry spells (red dots) tend to occur in the positive NPI regime during which temperature and precipitation tend to be positively correlated. In the opposing phase, less intense dry spells are observed, with negative correlations between temperature and precipitation. A third scenario exists, whereupon a correlation of near zero exists between P and T. The 2014/15 event falls under such zero correlation regime and is evidence that natural climate variability can drive years of extreme warmth and drought even when precipitation is normal. To understand the circulation and SST patterns associated with wet and dry spells along the Cascades, Fig. 5.1f shows the 250 mb streamfunction and SST differences between low and high snow frequency years. Low snow years are associated with a SST pattern that is analogous to the positive phase of the PDO (or to the interdecadal Pacific oscillation, which has a stronger tropical signal), with a warm tongue of water situated off the coast of California accompanied by an anomalous ridge over the PNW. The 2014/15 circulation anomalies ( Fig. 5.1g) produced a similar yet amplified pattern, including the high pressure over the West Coast and a low pressure over northeastern North America. This pair of circulations echo the dipole pattern associated with the 2013/14 California drought Funk et al. 2015) that occurred again in 2015. The circulation anomalies associated with the NPI (Fig. 5.1h) resembles the low snow frequency situation, as was previous documented (e.g., Mote 2006). By comparison, the 2014/15 circulation also bears resemblance to the pattern of North Pacific oscillation (NPO; Rogers 1981) ( Fig. 5.1i), with a similar (yet shifted) high pressure ridge over the western United States and warm SST anomalies in the northeastern Pacific. However, the 2014/15 SST anomalies feature an area of much warmer water around the PNW coast, referred to as a \"blob\" of warmer water consolidated into the PDO's region of ocean fluctuation that was strengthened by the stagnation of high pressure in the Gulf of Alaska (Bond et al. 2015). To analyze further the collective effects of NPI and NPO on the 2014/15 circulation anomalies, we computed t he regression coef f icients of streamfunction and SST anomalies with the NPI and NPO from 1949/50 to 2013/14 and weighted the coefficients against the observed values of the 2014/15 season; this led to a statistical estimate of the anomalies that are individually attributable to"}, {"section_title": "S22", "text": "DECEMBER 2016 | each mode. Then, a linear \"attribution\" analysis was carried out by removing the combined regressed patterns of the NPI and NPO from the 2014/15 anomalies (the NPO signal was \"regressed out\" from the NPI). The residual ( Fig. 5.1j) shows a weak swath of warmer SST across the North Pacific with some patches of cool waters, suggesting that the key SST feature in the 2014/15 situation near the PNW has been considerably reduced. The drought-inducing ridge engulfing the West Coast (Fig. 5.1g) was also reduced by more than one half with a displaced center. The residual SST could be explained by possible warming effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gases, as was argued by Weller et al. (2015). Because the Cascades' surface air temperature is significantly correlated with the offshore SST (Supplemental Fig. S5.1), these results hint a collective effect from anthropogenic warming and combined NPI-NPO modulation on the 2014/15 anomaly that led to low snowfall. The limited length of observational data poses a challenge in verifying the inferred NPI modulation on the fluctuating P-T relationship. We note that the CESM1's 30-member ensemble appears to capture the NPI in both the historical and future runs (using the same definition as in the observation), without any noticeable trend in the RCP8.5 runs ( Fig. 5.2a). Likewise, the model does not suggest any perceptible future deviation from the SCORR pattern between P and T ( Fig. 5.2b) either. This result suggests that the P-T SCORR and the NPI modulation are natural variability that are not projected to change. Additionally, the spectral coherence between the observed NPI (15-year low-pass) and the 15-year SCORR between P and T was computed. To address uncertainty in the coherence at low frequencies/long periods, we computed the spectral coherence for two periods: 101 ( Fig. 5.2c) and 59 ( Fig. 5.2d) years. The spectral coherency reveals dominant periodicities at 30-50 years, which is consistent with the NPI's periodicity. The low frequency band should be interpreted with caution owing to the limited data length. Nonetheless, both the historical (Fig. 5.2e) and future (Fig. 5.2f) simulations of the CESM1 reproduced this 30-50-year spectral peak of the coherency. This performance is in line with the CESM1's noted ability in reproducing the broad North Pacific SST variability  and the supposed stationarity of the NPI (Fig. 5.2a). Under the future scenario, the model projects an amplified spectral coherency of SCORR with NPI while the frequency remains unchanged. However, the increase in spectral coherency only marginally passes the red noise spectrum (not shown) and therefore does not suggest confidently that global warming would change the correspondence between the P-T regime and the NPI. In spite of these results, anthropogenic warming continues to pose a threat to the Cascades snowpack as shown in Supplemental Fig. S5.2a. The post-1970 increase in observed T coincides with the rising trend of simulated T, and these correspond to the expected decreasing trend in the projected S/P (Supplemental Fig. S5.2b). However, the accelerated increase in observed temperature and the record warmth in 2014/15 could be an early indication that, even though precipitation in the PNW does not change in the future, the persistent warming will increase the likelihood of a normal P and high T situation like 2014/15 or worse, a high T and low P scenario as suggested in the negative SCORR regime of Fig. 5.1d. In terms of risk assessment, these results suggest that any superimposition of a high T with low P would exacerbate drought, making it potentially more severe than the 2014/15 situation with normal P. The CESM1 projections lend support to such a possibility in the future. Summary. In the winter of 2014/15, the average temperature along the Cascades was the highest on record and occurred in tandem with the emergence of extremely positive SST anomalies that developed off the coast of the PNW. The high pressure ridge increased the PNW temperatures to a record level while reducing the snow frequency. Diagnostic analysis suggests that a significant portion of the circulation patterns associated with the 2014/15 snowpack drought can be explained by the North Pacific climate variability in the form of the NPI with a modulation from the NPO. Even though the effect of North Pacific climate variability on the PNW is well known (Stoelinga et al. 2010, Mote et al. 2014, Abatzoglou et al. 2014, this study uncovered a unique cyclical relationship between temperature and precipitation that is apparently driven by the low frequency variability of the NPI. This process is especially concerning in light of recent findings that despite little long-term trend in average West Coast precipitation, precipitation may be falling in more concentrated bursts (Prein et al. 2016) due to changes in certain circulation patterns (Swain et al. 2016;Lehmann and Coumou 2015  The Flood Event. High tides on 27 September 2015 flooded several Miami-region communities with 0.57 m of ocean water. The flooding was concerning because of the sunny-day conditions and awareness that trends of such events are accelerating within U.S. Atlantic Coast cities from rising seas (Sweet et al. 2014;Ezer and Atkinson 2014;Sweet and Marra 2016). It was the sixth largest flood measured by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tide gauge in Virginia Key, Florida (Miami region), since its 1994 installation ( Fig. 6.1a). The five higher floods were in response to hurricanes. The flood had substantial astronomical underpinnings ( Fig. 6.1b); it occurred during spring tides and near the peak of the seasonal mean sea level (MSL), the lunar 8.8-year perigee, and the 18.6-year nodal cycles. These factors explain the 0.24-m NOAA tide prediction relative to mean higher high water (MHHW) tidal datum that delineates typical tidal inundation (Schureman 2001;Parker 2007). Yet, tide forcing alone was insufficient to produce the observed impacts as minor \"nuisance\" flooding begins in excess of 0.4 meters in this region (Sweet et al. 2014). Other dynamics were at play. A nontidal sea level anomaly ( Fig. 6.1b, green line), which exceeded 0.15 m for a month starting September 22, reached 0.33 m during the flood and even higher for weeks afterwards. Strong high pressure over Eastern Canada (Fig. 6.1c) with >15 m s \u22121 northeasterlies offshore of the mid-Atlantic Bight (not shown) drove an Ekmanrelated setup along much of the U.S. East Coast. During the flood, setup was >20 cm along the southeast Florida coast as modeled by NOAA's extratropical surge and tide operational forecast system (Funakoshi et al. 2013). Local winds, however, were calm (<3 m s \u22121 ; http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/met), inverse barometer effects nonexistent ( Fig. 6.1c), and dynamical wave effects minimal as inferred by the ~1 cm standard deviations during tide measurements (Sweet et al. 2015). Interestingly, Gulf Stream transport measured upstream in the Florida Current (FC) slowed to a monthly minimum of 23.4 Sverdrup (Sv; 1 Sv \u2261 10 6 m 3 s \u22121 ) on 25 September (Fig. 6.1d), which persisted through the flood. Transport slowdowns raise MSL along the US southeast (Zhao and Johns 2014; Ezer 2016) and Florida coasts (Park and Sweet 2015) from adjustments to meridional Ekman transport (Lee and Williams 1988) and shelf-wave dynamics (Czeschel et al. 2012;Ezer 2016). Previous studies report a 0.5-1.5 cm rise in coastal MSL per 1-Sv decline in Gulf Stream system transport (Ezer et al. 2013;Woodworth et al. 2014;Goddard et al. 2015;Ezer 2016); when it slows, local tidal-flood risks increase (Sweet et al. 2009;Ezer and Atkinson 2014;Wdowinski et al. 2016). Here, we derive a contemporary return period of the flood using a time-dependent extreme value statistical model. Then, we assess the degree that (i) seasonal variability, (ii) tide cycles, (iii) FC monthly transport minimums, and (iv) a multidecadal trend have independently affected Virginia Key's extreme water level distribution and estimate their attribution during the flood. We conclude by analyzing how the flood's return period changes under future SLR projections for the Miami region forced by three representative concentration pathways (RCP). Data and Methods. Verified 6-minute and monthly water levels, sampling standard deviations, and tide The probability of a 0.57-m tidal flood within the Miami region has increased by >500% since 1994 from a 10.9-cm sea level rise (SLR)-related trend in monthly highest tides."}, {"section_title": "S26", "text": "DECEMBER 2016 | predictions are used for NOAA tide gauge Virginia Key (http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov).

We analyze monthly highest water levels using a generalized extreme value (GEV) model to assess flood height probabilities and decompose independent time-dependencies in the model's location parameter. We follow methods of Menendez and Woodworth (2010) described in the online supplemental information. Return level interval curves (Coles 2001) are constructed on a monthly and a 2015-annualized (12-month integrated) basis. Monthly return interval curves are vertically shifted by the time-dependent location parameter components (equation 2 in the online supplemental information) to assess climate variability and trend effects on the flood's return period. We use the classic (annual scale) curves to compute future projections for annual relevancy purposes. Return periods are approximated as \u22121/ln(F z ), where F is the cumulative probability of a flood with height z, instead of the traditional 1/(1\u2212F z ) method (Beran and Nozdryn-Plotnicki 1977;Coles 2001) to better estimate shorter return periods (e.g., <1 year). What role did climatic variability and trends play in the September 2015 flood? Our model estimates that a 0.57-m flood has a 6-year return period (black curve in Fig. 6.2a) during Septembers assuming conditions (e.g., nodal cycle, FC transport) match those during September 2015. The flood has a 3-year return period when considering (integrating across) all months "}, {"section_title": "S27", "text": "DECEMBER 2016 AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY | during 2015 (red curve in Fig. 6.2a), reflecting the peak seasonal location parameter during Octobers (Fig. 6.2b, green line). Highest water levels occur September-November ( Fig. 6.1d, yellow dots), typically during Octobers. If a 0.57-m flood occurred in February 2015 when the seasonal location parameter is minimum (21.1 cm lower than in September), a higher (less probable) water level would be required; it would have a >100-year return period. Our estimates ( Fig.6. 2a) are based upon a 22-year data record with a sample size 7 times longer than the flood's annualized return period, which results in low GEV-parameter estimate uncertainties (Fig. 6.2a). We note our return periods agree with those from a 50-year record from the nearby historic Miami NOAA gauge (http:// tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/est; Zervas 2013) and our seasonal location-parameter range of 23.9 cm matches its 23.7-cm MSL cycle (Zervas 2009). The 18.6-year lunar nodal cycle is estimated as having a 6-cm location-parameter range, which was near-peak during the f lood ( Fig. 6.2b). If at its minimum (and all other factors the same), the return period of this flood occurring in a September would have been 16.5 years instead of 6 years (>150% probability increase). The periodicity of the lunar perigee, which amplifies the tidal range on a ~4.4year cycle (Haigh et al. 2011), was included in our model but found to be insignificant. Similarly, had the flood occurred during a September with higher FC transport (e.g., 33.1 Sv in September 1997 and a 9-cm location parameter decrease shown in Fig. 6.2b), the return period would have been 29 years instead "}, {"section_title": "S28", "text": "DECEMBER 2016 | of 6 years (>350% probability increase). Our model estimates a 17-cm total range in location parameter due to co-variability with FC transport minimums, equating to a 0.9 \u00b1 0.2 cm increase for every 1-Sv decline, which agrees with previous estimates. Lastly, our model estimates a long-term trend in the location parameter of 0.5 \u00b1 0.1 cm year \u22121 (10.9 cm rise since beginning of 1994), which closely matches the trend in MSL (~11 cm in Fig. 6.2c). If the flood had occurred in September 1994, its return period would have been 39 years instead of 6 years (>500% probability increase) . What does the future hold in terms of more September 2015 flooding? The logical question is how much more frequent will these kinds of floods become in the future? To answer this question, the September 2015 flood is assessed in terms of its annualized return period (3 years; red curve in Fig. 6.2a), although flood frequencies will likely remain most prevalent during the fall (e.g., Fig. 6.1d). It is assumed that future changes in tidal flooding will occur only in response to local SLR, though variability (shown here) is significant. We use the 50th and 95th% SLR projections for Virginia Key forced by RCPs modeled by Kopp et al. (2014), which correspond to global SLR of 0.5-1.21 m by 2100. An overlay of Virginia Key's annual MSL ( Fig. 6.2c) shows a current trajectory between the 50th and 95th% of the RCP 8.5 SLR projections. By 2030, the flood is likely to become a 0.6-year event (~twice a year) under the median RCP 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 projections ( Fig. 6.2d) and a 0.2-year event (\u22655 times a year) under the 95th% of the RCP 8.5 projection. With 0.2 m more local SLR, which is exceeded under all local SLR projections between 2040-2050, the flood will occur >10 times a year (<0.1 year return period)."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.

Daily temperatures are estimated by averaging the minimum and maximum surface temperatures from station data from the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily Database (Menne et al. 2012). Since the 2015 cold wave was concentrated in February, we analyze 1 January-31 March (i.e., February and the two adjacent months) over the period 1950-2015. Area average time series are computed for the North, South, and mid-Atlantic United States. The spatial distribution of the February 2015 temperatures is evaluated using NCEP/NCAR reanalysis and shown in Fig. 7.1a. We also analyze climate model simulations from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5; Taylor et al. 2012). Models with daily surface temperature data were selected (see Table 7.1 for model list). Historical simulations for 1950-2004 contain both anthropogenic and natural forcing, and the historical simulations were extended to 2015 using the representative concentration pathway experiment 8.5. For consistency with our observational analysis, model data are area averaged over the North (40\u00b0-48\u00b0N, 83\u00b0-65\u00b0W), the mid-(35\u00b0-40\u00b0N, 83\u00b0-72\u00b0W), and the South Atlantic (25\u00b0-35\u00b0N, 89\u00b0-75\u00b0W). Daily temperature anomalies are evaluated as departures from the mean seasonal cycle (a third order polynomial fit of the January-March daily temperature) for the period 1950-2015. The intensity of the 2015 cold wave is quantified by the minimum daily temperature anomaly during JFM of that year, and its corresponding return period is estimated from a generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution.

Because the 20-year return level has increased over the past 66 years, cold events considered normal by 1950s standards are now rare in a warming climate. The number of days with daily JFM temperature anomalies below the 10th percentile (\"extremely cold days\") is shown for the three regions in Fig. 7.1c, and the number observed in 2015 is displayed next to each respective curve. The 2015 event in the North Atlantic broke last year's record (Fig 7.1c, small green dot). In the mid-Atlantic, this quantity dropped relative to 2014 but was still high, with 2015 having the 5th largest number of extremely cold days in the region (Fig  7.1c, large black dot). There is no systematic trend in the number of extremely cold days, thus no evidence to suggest that the frequency or persistence of cold events is systematically changing. We estimate the return period for the duration of the cold event by fitting the number of extremely cold days to a negative binomial distribution. We focus our analysis on the North Atlantic, where the duration of cold was record breaking. The negative binomial distribution (blue line in Fig. 7.1d) fits reasonably well the return times for the number of North Atlantic extremely cold days (blue circles in Fig. 7.1d) and indicates that the 2015 event (red dot in Fig. 7.1d) was approximately a one-in-64-year event in terms of the number of extremely cold days. Observational analysis alone is unable to isolate the relative importance of natural versus human forcing in driving the above changes. To do so, we estimate the trend in the location parameter of the GEV distribution fit to the minimum JFM daily temperature from a suite of CMIP5 climate experiments. The location trends and corresponding 95% | confidence intervals for the historical simulations (black) and observations (red) are shown in Fig. 7.2. The observed trend in the North Atlantic is positive and statistically significant. Observed trends in the other two regions are not statistically significant and are not shown. Like observations, all of the climate models have an upward trend (warmer minimum temperatures) in the location parameters of the GEV for North Atlantic minimum JFM daily temperature anomaly, and this positive trend is statistically significant in more than half of the models. These results suggest that events like the 2015 cold wave are becoming less likely in response to climate change. Discussion. The 2015 cold wave that impacted the eastern United States can be described as a one-in-15-year event in terms of intensity and a one-in-64 year event in terms of duration. Only the magnitude of cold extremes in the North Atlantic United States shows significant long-term trend. Consistent with observations, the majority of climate models find that climate change has led to a shift in the distribution of winter daily minimum temperatures toward warmer conditions, and subsequently a decrease in the likelihood of extreme cold waves in the North Atlantic. This result contradicts the hypothesis that cold winter temperatures are becoming more extreme (Francis and Vaurus 2015). Rather we find observed trends toward a warmer, less variable climate, and a decrease in the likelihood of such cold winter extremes."}, {"section_title": "S38", "text": "DECEMBER 2016 | not be understood by Arctic sea ice decline (e.g., Barnes 2013) and find that these are an articulation of internal atmospheric variability (Sun et al. 2016). Hartmann (2015) relates the recent series of cold NA events to an oceanic internal anomaly of sea surface temperature (SST) prevailing over the east Pacific in 2015, and referred to as the North Pacific mode (NPM; Deser and Blackmon 1995). However, the NPM decayed to an almost neutral state at the beginning of 2015 (Supplemental Fig. S8.3), although a confined positive anomaly along the west coast of NA markedly remained (Fig. 8.1d and globally Supplemental Fig. S8.4). Reforecasting the cold February 2015. The aim of this study is to assess, using retrospective climate predictions, the contributions of the described anomalous SST pattern (of predominantly natural origin; Hartman 2015) and Arctic sea ice retreat (mainly attributable to anthropogenic climate change; Bindoff 2013) to the occurrence of the cold NA and its associated flow. The predictions rely on simulations using the atmosphere-only integrated forecast system (IFS; cycle 36r4) forced by SST and SIC from the ERA-Interim reanalysis . Three types of retrospective predictions of February 2015 are carried out. A first experiment aims at reproducing the event using actual atmospheric conditions in 2015 as initial conditions and surface boundary forcings (hereafter referred to as INI). Two additional experiments test the sensitivity to either SST (using a 1981-2010 SST climatology instead of the 2015 state as boundary conditions, CLIMSST) or SIC (using a 1981-2000 SIC climatology, hereafter CLIMICE, omitting the last decade in order to exclude Arctic sea ice decline in the climatology). Note that prescribing SSTs bears the risk of exaggerated ocean heat release due to the lack of coupling with the ocean and thus potentially overestimates the influence of anomalous SSTs. Each experiment is initialized from observational estimates of the atmospheric state from ERA-Interim including singular vector perturbations (Buizza and Palmer 1994) to generate 100 ensemble members. The experiments are initialized on 1 January and 1 February to assess timescales at which predictability of the event emerges. Furthermore, a hindcast set of the 1981-2010 period has been carried out using three-monthly predictions initialized each 1 January and 1 February with ten ensemble members in order to evaluate the reliability of the model to simulate cold events over North America and identify systematic biases in the mean for bias correction. The ensemble-mean prediction starting in February (Fig. 8.1e) captures the event shown with a pronounced cold anomaly in the Northeast and a warming in the Southwest. Both experiments using either climatological SSTs or climatological SIC reproduce the event as well, demonstrating that the atmospheric initial state holds the main sources of predictability of the event. The ensemble-mean prediction starting in January (Fig. 8.1f) shows much less pronounced temperature anomalies over the target region and does not reproduce the spatial pattern. This suggests that surface boundary conditions did not force the core of the event, neither did potential stratospheric precursors (Supplemental Fig. S8.5) or anomalies linked to sea ice conditions preceding the predictions (Kim et al. 2014). Attribution to surface boundary conditions. Retrospective predictions of the extreme cold February 2015 suggest that the atmospheric flow established in late Januaryearly February was mainly internally generated, yet surface boundary conditions could still have played a role in altering the probability that such an unlikely event occurred. To answer this question, we compare the probabilities to observe the recorded temperatures anomalies and their associated anomalous flow in the CLIMSST, CLIMICE, and INI experiments. The attribution relying on predictions starting in January and February is seemingly similar, but addresses a different question since the atmospheric anomaly is largely set in on 1 February. The attribution relying on the February and January predictions therefore quantifies how surface boundary conditions have contributed in sustaining or establishing the anomaly, respectively. The model ensembles are calibrated following Bellprat and Doblas-Reyes (2016), in order to correct for model limitations in representing this type of events (more details in the online supplemental material). The calibrated probability density functions (PDFs) of the 100 members of the model ensembles are shown in Figs. 8.2a,b (temperature) and Figs. 8.2e,f (jet). The predictions starting in February are shifted towards the observed anomalies (black lines) while the predictions starting in January have almost no ensemble-mean anomaly as discussed in the previous section. The picture is overall consistent between temperature and the jet index. Changes in the surface boundary forcing reduce the ensemble variability in all cases, yet only significantly for the jet index (F-test at 5% significance level). The ensemblemean is slightly colder in CLIMSST, possibly linked to "}, {"section_title": "S40", "text": "DECEMBER 2016 | advection of colder Arctic temperatures (compared to INI) due to larger ice coverage (Sun et al. 2016). The observed event represents a rare case, particularly for the temperature anomaly, and a generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) retaining 20% of ensemble data is used to estimate the event probability for predictions starting in February (Figs. 8.2c,d and g,h) and January (Supplemental Fig. S8.4). The return period of the temperature anomaly in the conditioned predictions (starting in February) is 100 years and around 1000 years in the unconditioned predictions (starting in January), consistent with the return time estimated from the observations as described in the introduction. Changes in event probabilities (intercept with the black line, Fig. 8.2) reveal lower probabilities in CLIMSST for both temperature and the jet index and lower probabilities for CLIMICE for the jet index compared to INI. For the temperature anomaly, sea ice conditions seem not to have played a role. The uncertainty ranges (determined by resampling) are overall large (95% confidence bounds, thin lines). Differences in probabilities are qualitatively consistent with predictions starting in January. Overall we find that SST and SIC have increased the probability of establishing a meandering flow approximately by a factor 10 (January predictions, Supplemental Figs. S8.4e,f) and doubled the probability that the flow maintained its wavy structure (February predictions, Figs. 8.2g,h). The temperature anomaly would have been extremely unlikely if anomalous SSTs would not have persisted in February (Fig. 8.2c), yet the cold anomaly represents an extreme case without preconditioning the flow (Supplemental Figs. S8.4ad), regardless of the surface boundary forcing. As a summary we conclude that reduced Arctic sea ice, which is linked to anthropogenic activity, and anomalous SSTs, mainly a consequence of natural variability, did not drive the core of the event, but they may have both contributed in establishing and sustaining the anomalous meander of the jet stream, and hence, could contribute in the near future to enlarge the probability of such extreme cold spells in the region.

Barnes Bonsal et al. 2011), the drought that affected the area during the spring and summer of 2015 ( Fig. 9.1a) was unusual in terms of its severity, extent, and impacts. British Columbia (B.C.) and Alberta were the most severely affected provinces. Vast areas in southern B.C. were assigned the highest possible (Level-4) drought rating by the B.C. government, several extreme-low streamflow advisories, and extreme wildfire risk ratings. Stringent water restrictions were in place by the end of June (AFCC 2016). In Alberta, conditions were even drier, and the Alberta government declared the province an Agricultural Disaster Area by early August. The extreme dry and warm conditions also created one of the most active and longest wildfire seasons for western Canada, and some rivers ran at their lowest recorded flows since measurements began 80 to 100 years ago (CMOS 2016). The extreme heat and dryness the region experienced in 2015 have raised concerns as to whether or not anthropogenic climate change (ACC) has increased the risk of extreme droughts in the area; this is the question we attempt to address in this paper. Hydrometeorological conditions. Because the drought affected a vast area that includes regions characterized by different climate conditions, this study focuses on southern B.C., among the worst-affected regions. Three critical factors need to exist for severe drought to occur in southern B.C.: 1) low snowpack near the end of winter, 2) dry spring (May-June), and 3) dry summer (July-August) conditions (BCMOE 2016). The winter preceding the drought was characterized by near-normal precipitation. Apart from the extremely low snowpack that was observed in southwestern B.C. throughout the winter, near-normal to slightly below-normal snowpacks were present near the end of winter across most of the province (BCRFC 2015a). However, due to anomalously warm temperatures in March and April (MA; Fig. 9.2a), record low snow water equivalent (SWE) was observed over most of southern B.C. by 1 May (BCRFC 2015b). A persistent upper ridge off the west coast of North America (Fig. 9.1b) resulted in extraordinary warm and dry conditions from May through July (MJJ; Fig. 9.1c). The low SWE was compounded by the extreme dry conditions to create one of the worst droughts in the region. Time series of region-averaged standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index (SPEI; Vicente-Serrano et al. 2010) for MJJ shows that the value for 2015 was the second lowest for the 1950-2015 period ( Fig.9.1d), reflecting the significant surface moisture deficit in the area. Methods. Attribution for the 2015 event is carried out using CMIP5 results (Taylor et al. 2012). It is wellknown that coarse-grid climate models have very limited skills in simulating precipitation or SWE at regional scales. The preceding discussion suggests that it is justifiable to simplify the attribution analysis by limiting the drivers to the warm MA temperature (T 34 ) that caused the enhanced and earlier than normal melt and subsequent low summer runoff, and the hot and dry MJJ weather that aggravated the conditions during the growing season. In addition, the intensity of the upper ridge, which is physically linked to the variability of both precipitation (P) and temperature (T) during MJJ, is used as proxy for both variables. It is evident from the point correlation map of region-averaged MJJ P with geopotential heights (Z) at 500 hPa (  where the anomalies are relative to the 1971-2000 climatology. Locations of the region D and transects used in the calculation of H are shown in Fig. 9.1e. H exhibits statistically significant correlations with precipitation over western Canada in general ( Fig. 9.1f). Contemporaneous correlations between detrended H and P, T, and SPEI averaged over southern B.C. are \u22120.68, 0.74, and \u22120.76, respectively. Time series of H computed from reanalysis data ( Fig.  9.2c) shows that years of extreme positive values of H (e.g., above the 95th percentile-Hc = 60 m) also correspond well with extreme dry and warm years. In particular, both the driest and hottest MJJ and largest H occurred in 1958, and the value for 2015 is the third "}, {"section_title": "S44", "text": "DECEMBER 2016 | largest over the period. The other two high H years (1969 and 1992) were also exceptionally warm and dry, but the conditions improved in July, resulting in less extreme seasonal averages. To determine how greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing influences T 34 and the H-index, we compare the trends and other statistics of these variables as computed from observed or reanalysis data and ensembles of CMIP5 historical simulations with natural (NAT) or all (ALL) forcings. The list of 19 CMIP5 models used in the analysis is given in the online supplemental information. The change in likelihood of extreme droughts in southern B.C. from GHG forcing is assessed by evaluating how the exceedance probabilities for these variables differ between the ALL and NAT ensembles. This is achieved by calculating the fraction of attributable risk (FAR;, as detailed in the supplemental information. Results. We first investigate if ACC has increased the risk of reduced snowpacks at the end of winter. There is no detectable trend of December-March precipitation in either the observations or CMIP5 results (not shown). There are, however, significant warming trends for T 34 in both the observed and CMIP5-ALL ensemble-mean data, but not for the NAT runs (Fig. 9.2a). No significant increasing trend is evident in the ensemble maximum T 34 for either ALL or NAT. The best estimate (median) FAR calculated by using thresholds corresponding to the 96th percentiles of "}, {"section_title": "S45", "text": "DECEMBER 2016 AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY | T34 in ALL runs (i.e., the same percentile for the T 34 observed for 2015) is about 0.49 ( Fig. 9.2b). This suggests that external forcing (mainly anthropogenic forcing) may have doubled the risk for the occurrence of the recent extreme high T 34 that resulted in the early snowmelt, as evidenced by the early peak flows in the streamflow data (BCRFC 2015b). We note, however, that the FAR estimate has a large spread. How ACC might have affected the MJJ conditions is examined next. Figure 9.1c shows that both T and P increased between 1950 and 2015. Given that there is no trend in the area-average SPEI ( Fig. 9.1d), it is likely that the effects of increasing P on surface water balance could have been offset by the increase in evapotranspiration due to the warming temperatures during this time. Regardless of whether the increases in T and P were the result of ACC, the results suggest they currently do not have detectable influence on surface water balance in MJJ and thus drought risk in the region. Next we assess whether GHG forcing has affected the upper ridge that creates the meteorological conditions (i.e., low P and high T) that are critical for the development of extreme drought. The bounds of H computed from either the ALL or NAT ensembles are comparable to those exhibited in the H-index derived from the NCEP reanalysis, suggesting that the \"observed\" variability of H was reproduced by the models in these two experiments. No significant trend (at 5% level) is detected for either the NCEP H or ensemble statistics (median, extrema, etc.) for the two CMIP5 experiments ( Fig. 9.2c; results are not shown for NAT), suggesting that GHG forcing has not produced detectable change in the intensity of the west coast upper ridge and the attendant increase in the risk of drought in the area. Lastly, we examine if ACC has increased the risk of extreme H that are associated with extreme droughts. Results show that the exceedance probability for extreme H in ALL runs is similar to and perhaps somewhat smaller than that in NAT runs (Fig. 9.2d), suggesting that GHG forcing has not resulted in detectable increase in the risk of extremely high H, and consequently the occurrence of intense stationary upper ridge and associated extreme warm and dry conditions. Similar results are also obtained for a parallel analysis that was carried out by constructing H based on the Z' composited over the three driest MJJ during the 1950-2015 period. Concluding remarks. The multifaceted characteristics and forcings of droughts render attribution analysis of their causes a challenging task, particularly for a region where both cold-and warm-season processes are critical for drought development. Results from this study indicate that ACC likely played a role in causing the warm late-winter temperatures and the associated reduction in snowpack that set the stage for the 2015 drought. On the other hand, there is no detectable evidence that GHG forcing influenced the intensity or the likelihood of occurrence for the strong and persistent upper-air ridge off the west coast that brought the record heat and dryness in MJJ, which escalated the drought to an extreme event. The results thus suggest that the extreme drought was likely an outcome of anthropogenic effect that has increased the occurrence of extreme warm spring temperatures and natural climate variability that caused the persistent upper ridge. The climate of western Canada is known to be influenced strongly by key Pacific climate variability modes on sub-seasonal to multidecadal time scales (Gan et al. 2007). For instance, the developing intense 2015-16 El Ni\u00f1o could have contributed to the extreme summer conditions. However, the question of whether or not El Ni\u00f1o played a role does not alter the conclusion that the extreme MJJ conditions were mainly a result of natural variability. Lastly, it is noteworthy that analysis of CMIP5 projections suggests that both late-winter warming and the west coast upper ridge could be enhanced in response to GHG forcing during the latter part of this century. As such, effects of changes in warm-season precipitation and temperature on the surface water budget might not offset each other, or may even reinforce each other in the future. The collective effects of these projected changes on future extreme droughts in western Canada are being investigated and the results will be reported elsewhere."}, {"section_title": "S46", "text": "As models do not provide a sunshine duration diagnostic, we employ the downward solar (SW) flux at the surface as a proxy (Fig. 10.1a). Observed winter sunshine hours and solar radiation averaged over the United Kingdom have a correlation of 0.9 over the common observational period, though individual years may differ in sign of anomaly (e.g., 2010). Cloud cover (correlation coefficient 0.3 for inverse variable estimated from observations) would be less suitable in our analysis, as it also incorporates a nighttime component.

An increase relative to the natural world becomes evident after the 1990s. The 2014/15 flux was 1.55 times above the mean during the observational period (1998-2012), which corresponds to an anomaly estimate of 4.1 W m \u22122 (green line in Fig. 10.1b). This estimate is subsequently used as a threshold to calculate the probabilities of extreme events P 1 and P 0 . Modeled fluxes for the actual climate are evaluated against NCIC observations and data from the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis . We select the common winters in the three datasets and using anomalies relative to the common period mean, we conduct two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests that show no significant difference between the simulated fluxes and the reanalysis or observational data (P values greater than 0.1; Fig. 10.1c). The good agreement remains when the model is evaluated over a longer period against the reanalysis (which includes more years than the observations). Apart from the role of anthropogenic climate change, the possible contribution from the atmospheric flow in winter 2014/15 to the extreme sunshine will also be considered in our study (Fig.  10.1d). Synoptic conditions are often crucial to the occurrence of extremes (Wallace et al. 2015;Deser et al. 2012). For example, a persistent southwesterly flow over the United Kingdom was a key factor to the extreme rainfall in the winter before the one examined in this study . Figure 10.1d illustrates a predominantly zonal westerly flow in winter 2014/15 (also seen in the surface pressure pattern and consistent with the observed positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation), which transports moist air over the United Kingdom and would not "}, {"section_title": "S49", "text": "DECEMBER 2016 AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY | generally be expected to provide favorable conditions for sunshine. The warming ocean seen in SST observations would also not favor extreme sunshine, as it increases the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere. The observed 2014/15 winter mean SST over the wider U.K. region is close to its mean value after 1980 when the sunshine increases and is therefore unlikely to have influenced the event. Results. We first estimate the return time corresponding to the 2014/15 solar flux anomaly and investigate how it has changed in the present climate relative to the natural world, irrespective of the atmospheric circulation (i.e., under any synoptic conditions). We use the winters of the most recent simulated decade (2004-13) as a proxy of the present climate (i.e., 150 seasons for each experiment) and construct distributions of the solar flux anomaly with and without human influence. Estimates of P 1 and P 0 are then obtained from the two distributions using the generalized Pareto distribution, while uncertainties are derived with a Monte Carlo bootstrap procedure (Christidis et al. 2013). In that way, we construct the return time (inverse probability) distributions shown in Fig. 10.2a. The results indicate that anthropogenic forcings lead to a marked decrease in the return time from 48 to 14 years (best estimates, defined as the 50th percentile of the distributions). The distribution of the FAR is shown in Fig 10.2b. The best estimate of the FAR is 0.72, suggesting that human influence increases the chances of extreme events by a factor of 3.6 (5%-95% uncertainty range: 1.6-17.2). We also examine how the chances have changed in consecutive decades since the 1960s (Fig. 10.2c). The return time decreases from over a century in the mid-1960s to about 15 years after the mid-1990s and remains well below the NAT estimates in the last 20 years. To assess the effect of the atmospheric circulation, we adopt the approach of Christidis and Stott (2015), whereby we partition the simulated winters between those that resemble the reference flow pattern (Fig.  10.1d) and those that do not. The grouping is based on the correlation coefficient over the wider U.K. region marked by the box in Fig. 10.1d. To separate the circulation effect from that of anthropogenic forcings, we only use the NAT simulations, which yield a total of 810 winters, 197 of which belong to the high-correlation group with correlation coefficients above 0.6. The mean flow of the highly correlated seasons resembles the reanalysis pattern, whereas the mean of winters with low correlations displays a weak easterly flow (see online supplemental material). The latter is associated with colder and drier continental air over the United Kingdom, which is more conducive to sunny conditions. Indeed, we find that winters with low-pattern correlations are about 14 times more likely to break the 2014/15 flux record (5%-95% uncertainty range: 3.7 to >10 3 ). Our findings are not too sensitive to the choice of the correlation coefficient used to discriminate between seasons (see online supplemental material). Conclusions.

This trend together with internal variability appear to have been key drivers of the 2014/15 record, which occurred within a meteorological context not typical of sunny conditions. Changes in aerosol emissions constitute the component of the anthropogenic forcing most likely to affect sunshine (Sanchez-Romero et al. 2014). Unlike winter, NCIC observations do not show a notable trend in summer sunshine, when one might expect the direct effect from reduced aerosol concentrations to be larger due to the decreased cloud amount. The discrepancy might be a result of the indirect effect linked to changes in cloud properties that could be stronger in winter, though this needs to be further investigated in future work.  Fig. S11.1). The anomalous temperatures were caused by a sequence of four intense heat waves that struck the region from the end of June to early September (e.g., Fig. 11.1a). It is precisely the few-day heat that causes problems with human health, especially when combined with high humidity (McGregor et al. 2010). We analyze seasonal maxima of 3-day mean temperature (Tair 3d, max ) and seasonal maxima of 3-day daily maximum wet bulb temperature (WBTX 3d, max ), a measure of human thermal discomfort that combines temperature and humidity and is a proxy for heat stress on the human body (Fischer and Knutti 2013; Sherwood and Huber 2010). The series of heat waves began with a strongly meandering jet stream, that is summertime \"omegablocking\" (Dole et al. 2011), and the advection of very warm subtropical air into central and western Europe (Supplemental Fig. S11.1). Later in the season, the jet stream was displaced to the north, so that stable high-pressure systems could prevail over central and eastern Europe bringing heat there. The first heat wave in early July was hence most pronounced in western parts of the continent, while south-central and east-central Europe experienced the highest temperatures in the subsequent heat waves later in the season (Fig. 11.1b)."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.

WBTX 3d, max is derived from daily maximum air temperature and vapor pressure (computed from relative humidity and daily mean temperature; www.srh.noaa.gov /epz/?n=wxcalc_rh) using an iterative procedure based on the psychrometric equation (Sullivan and Sanders 1974). Subsequently, generalized extreme value (GEV) statistical models are fitted to the data (Coles 2001) excluding the year 2015, using two different assumptions about changes in climate: 1) A \"local\" station-based covariate to the location parameter of the GEV (21-year smoothed local summer temperatures, SLST) as a proxy for any changes to local climate; 2) A \"global\" covariate to the location parameter (21-year smoothed global mean temperatures, SGMT) as a proxy for anthropogenic influence on climate (van Oldenborgh et al. 2012).

Second, a model ensemble-based assessment using the global general circulation model HadAM3P (1.875\u00b0 \u00d7 1.25\u00b0 \u00d7 15-min resolution) and a dynamically downscaled regional variant (HadRM3P, 0.44\u00b0 \u00d7 0.44\u00b0 \u00d7 5-min resolution) is conducted to complement the empirical analysis (see Massey et al. 2015 for all details regarding the model setup). Initial condition ensembles are generated for an anthropogenic scenario (ANT, n = 2286), in which the model is driven by observed (2015) sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and anthropogenic forcings in atmosphere-only mode for 1 year at a time (starting 1 December; Massey et al. 2015); and a natural scenario (NAT, n = 4414) with all anthropogenic forcings (i.e., greenhouse gases, aerosols, halocarbons, and ozone) set to preindustrial levels and 11 different estimates of natural SSTs (Schaller et al. 2014). For each of the four locations (centered over a 1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0 grid cell), a resampling bias correction strategy based on an observational constraint is applied to the model ensemble (Sippel et al. 2016) because the raw model output is notoriously too hot and dry Massey et al. 2015), severely compromising attribution statements (Supplemental Fig. S11.2).

Subsequently, both natural and anthropogenic simulations are resampled using the derived relationship (Sippel et al. 2016). In contrast to widely used methods like quantile-quantile mapping, resampling retains the full multivariate structure and physical consistency of the model output but reduces the available ensemble size and chooses colder and wetter ensemble members, therefore alleviating the hot and dry bias (Sippel et al. 2016). In the context of event attribution, it is applied for the first time in this paper (Figs. 11.2a-d; see next section). To avoid potential mean biases due to station location, the mean of the resampled ensemble is adjusted to the station mean (Supplemental Figs. S11.2c,d).

In spite of this difference, the increase in the probability ratio is similar. A simi la r a na lysis is conducted in a very large ensemble of model simula-tions.

This indicates that robust attribution statements for impact-related, and thus multivariate quantities (such as WBTX 3d, max ), require a physically consistent bias correction of model output. Consistent with the observations, the model-based assessment shows a shift in the return periods toward more frequent and more pronounced summer heat stress (Fig. 11.2b) in all locations (Table 11.1) and both bias-corrected and original simulations.

These estimates are thus lower than those estimated from the observations but can be largely explained by method-and datarelated differences. For instance, the statistical method assumes that the trend is caused fully by anthropogenic factors, while the model analysis is based on a \"real counterfactual\" scenario but tends to underestimate warming trends in temperature extremes in Europe . The mean observed change across all locations between 2015 and 1901 of 3.1\u00b0C (Tair 3d, max ) and 2.2\u00b0C (WBTX 3d, max ) is much larger than the original (+1.1\u00b0C in Tair 3d, max and +0.5\u00b0C in WBTX 3d, max ) and bias corrected (+0.9\u00b0C in Tair 3d, max and +0.5\u00b0C in WBTX 3d, max ) model simulations.

These temperature anomalies are associated with an anomalous anticyclonic circulation (not shown) and reduced precipitation over central Europe and a weak increase over northern Europe (Supplemental Figs. S12.1b,g). Importantly, the magnitude of changes in Tmax and TXx is about twice that in seasonal mean daily minimum temperature (Tmin) and the annual hottest night temperature (TNx), suggesting an important role of land-atmosphere-cloud feedbacks associated with the precipitation deficit over central Europe in summer. This results in a reduction of evaporation and cloud cover associated with soil drying, enhancing Tmax and TXx more than Tmin and TNx through increased daytime downward shortwave radiation and decreased daytime upward latent heat flux (Vautard et al. 2007;Fischer and Sch\u00e4r 2010;Mueller and Seneviratne 2012;Bo\u00e9 and Terray 2014;Miralles et al. 2014;Perkins 2015;Dong et al. 2016). Precipitation anomalies in the winter and spring seasons before summer 2015 were much smaller than in summer over central Europe (not shown). This implies the land-atmosphere-cloud feedback on the 2015 European heat wave was mainly through simultaneous precipitation deficit rather than a presummer deficit over central Europe. What caused these anomalous summer conditions over central Europe in 2015? Relative to the 1964-93, warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) were present in many regions (Fig. 12.1i), with a prominent warm anomaly (>1.2\u00b0C) in the tropical Pacific during the developing phase of the exceptionally strong 2015/16 El Ni\u00f1o (WMO 2016). There were also SST anomalies along the Gulf Stream extension in the North Atlantic with a cooling to the north and warming to the south. Associated with this feature is an enhanced meridional SST gradient along the Gulf Stream extension. This might have favored a northward shift of the North Atlantic summer storm track (e.g., Ogawa et al. 2012;Dong et al. 2013a and2013b;Duchez et al. 2016), which would result in reduced precipitation in summer 2015 over central Europe (Supplemental Fig. S12.1g).

In this study, we do not address the anthropogenic contribution to SST/SIE changes, but rather consider these changes as an independent forcing factor. We use the atmosphere configuration of the Met Office Hadley Centre Global Environment Model version 3 (HadGEM3-A; Hewitt et al. 2011), with a resolution of 1.875\u00b0 longitude by 1.25\u00b0 latitude and 85 vertical levels. The CONTROL experiment is performed for the period 1964-93. Two other experiments, 2015ALL and 2015SST, are performed for the period November 2014 to October 2015, use 2015 SST/SIE boundary conditions, but they differ in the specification of GHG and AA forcings (Table 12.1). All experiments are 27 years long, with only the last 25 years used for analysis (as an ensemble of 25 one-year members). The CONTROL experiment reproduces both the mean and interannual variability of summer SAT over central Europe, despite the fact that there is no interannual variability in SST/SIE, GHG, and AA (Supplemental Fig. S12.1a). However, there are biases in the simulated seasonal mean precipitation and some temperature extremes in CONTROL (Supplemental Figs. S12.1b-e). Precipitation is overestimated by 0.23 mm day \u22121 (~10% larger than observations), Tmax is underestimated by 1.5\u00b0C, and Tmin is overestimated by 1.5\u00b0C. As a result, seasonal mean SAT is similar to observations, but DTR is underestimated by about 3.0\u00b0C in CONTROL (a common bias in AGCMs and RGCMs; e.g., Kysely and Plavcova 2012;Cattiaux et al. 2015). The underestimation of Tmax, TXx, and DTR, and overestimation of Tmin and TNx (not shown) imply that the cloud cover over the region in the model might be overestimated, as suggested by the overestimation of area-averaged precipitation. Despite the mean biases in the temperature extremes, their interannual variability in the CONTROL experiment is in broad agreement with observations (Supplemental Figs. S12.1a-e). In response to all forcing changes (2015ALL), the area-averaged summer warming over central Europe is 1.6\u00b0C, compared to 2.4\u00b0C in observations (Fig.  12.2a). This implies that about 2/3 of the observed summer warming might have been anticipated as a mean response to SST/SIE and anthropogenic forcing changes. Spatial patterns of changes in SAT and temperature extremes show some differences to observed changes (Figs. 12.1, and 12.2) with the large temperature changes in the model displaced eastward to eastern Europe. The model mean response shows warming and an increase in temperature extremes over both central and northern Europe (Figs. 12.2c-h), but does not capture the observed precipitation reduction over central Europe (not shown). Therefore, it is likely that the model is not capturing cloud and land surface feedbacks induced by precipitation changes, and thus underestimates the observed surface warming and changes in Tmax and TXx over central Europe by about 1/3, while simulated changes in Tmin and TNx are similar in magnitude to observations (Fig. 12.2a). The SST/SIE changes have a relatively weak effect on SAT and hot extremes but lead to a considerable increase in Tmin and TNx, likely related in part to water vapor feedback because increased water vapor in the atmosphere enhances the downward longwave radiation, which has a large impact on night temperatures (Dai et al. 1999;Dong et al. 2016). Quantitatively, SST/SIE changes explain 22.5% of the area-averaged central European warming signal in the model, with the remaining 77.5% explained by GHG and AA changes with an assumption that the responses to different forcings add linearly (Fig. 12.2b), indicating a dominant role for the direct impact of anthropogenic "}, {"section_title": "Experiments", "text": "Boundary conditions"}, {"section_title": "CONTROL", "text": "Forced with monthly mean climatological sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice extent (SIE) averaged over the period of 1964 to 1993 using HadISST data , with greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations averaged over the same period, and anthropogenic aerosol (AA) precursor emissions averaged over the period of 1970 to 1993 (Lamarque et al. 2010)."}, {"section_title": "2015ALL", "text": "Forced with monthly mean SST and SIE from November 2014 to October 2015 using HadISST data, with GHG concentrations in 2014 (WMO 2015), and AA precursor emissions for 2015 from RCP4.5 scenario (Lamarque et al. 2011)."}, {"section_title": "2015SST", "text": "As 2015ALL, but with GHG concentrations and AA precursor emissions the same as in CONTROL."}, {"section_title": "S60", "text": "DECEMBER 2016 | forcings in changes of summer SAT and temperature extremes in the model mean response (Fig. 12.2b; Supplemental Fig. S12.2).

The magnitudes, relative to CONTROL, of the area-averaged summer SAT and temperature extremes in this driest year are very close to the observed anomalies (Supplemental Fig. S12.1f).

This suggests that changes in SST/SIE and anthropogenic forcings set preconditions for an extremely dry year, such as summer 2015, to occur in the model simulation. The inability of the model to reproduce observed precipitation anomalies in the mean response, and the good agreement of changes in one particular year with observed anomalies in response to changes in all forcings, suggests that internal atmospheric variability might have played a significant role for the reduction in precipitation, and hence the severity of the 2015 European summer heat "}, {"section_title": "S61", "text": "DECEMBER 2016 AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY | wave. Specifically, our simulations suggest internal variability contributed about 1/3 of the observed summer warming and increases in hot temperature extremes over central Europe, in line with attributions of the severity of the 2010 Russian heat wave (e.g., Dole et al. 2011;Otto et al. 2012). However, it is important to recognize that the quantitative partitioning of causes is potentially sensitive to model biases, such as the mean wet bias discussed earlier. Conclusions. Summer 2015 was marked by hot and dry conditions over central Europe and significant increases in temperature extremes. Model experiments indicate that high temperatures were caused by a combination of forced responses and internal atmospheric variability. Model simulations suggest that changes in SST/SIE and anthropogenic forcings explain about 2/3 (1.6\u00b0C) of the observed warming (2.4\u00b0C) and changes in hot temperature extremes over central Europe relative to 1964-93. Interestingly, when comparing 2015SST with 2015ALL simulations, the results indicate that the impact of anthropogenic forcings plays the dominant role. About 1/3 (0.8\u00b0C) of the observed summer mean warming and changes in hot extremes is not explained by the model mean response and consequently may have resulted from internal variability, principally through physical processes associated with precipitation deficits. Thus, our results indicate that anthropogenic forcings set the conditions for the development of the 2015 heat wave in central Europe, but that internal variability was an important factor in explaining its extreme character. . In 2015, however, the northward progression of the onset of rainfall exhibited some anomalous behavior. In April, the ITD did not advance substantially from March, being more than 2\u00b0 south of its usual latitudinal position and also about 1\u00b0 south of the 10th percentile of its southernmost latitudinal position based on the 1981-2010 climatological period (Fig. 13.1a). Consequently, almost the entire country experienced April rains that were 40% below normal (Fig. 13.1b). The situation improved in the month of May when the southern and central regions experienced almost normal rainfalls (i.e., \u00b1 20%), but areas north of 10\u00b0N still experienced more than 40% rainfall deficits (Fig. 13.1c). Normal rainfall amounts arrived in the northern regions in June, even though the ITD remained about 2\u00b0 south of its climatological latitudinal positions from April to July (Fig. 13.1a)."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS. This work was", "text": "According to reports from farmers (e.g., Daily Post [Nigeria], 21 June 2015; Okojie 2015) and personal conversations with some stakeholders, there were widespread crop failures resulting from continuous irregular rainfall (Agbo et al. 2015). Consequently, socio-economic activities, food production, and water resources were negatively affected during the year because the rainfall and growing seasons started much later than expected. Although the economic implications of the delay in the onset of the 2015 wet season have not been quantified at the time of this report, the nation witnessed abrupt increases in the prices of food commodities, thereby affecting food security (www.foodsecurityportal.org/nigeria /indicators; Agbo et al. 2015). With the growing confidence of users in climate models (which are used for planning in order to mitigate the threat of climate variability and change; Abiodun et al. 2012; Olaniyan et al. 2015), a number of questions arise: Can simulations of current generation atmosphere-land climate models capture the late onsets such as occurred in 2015 in Nigeria? What is the role of anomalous sea surface temperatures (SSTs), as well as anthropogenic interference in the climate system (or non-anthropogenic interference) in altering the chance of the 2015 late onset of the rainy season over Nigeria? Data. In this study, we use daily rainfall and dewpoint observations from a network of more than 50 meteorological stations of the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet; www.nimet.gov.ng). We also analyze simulations conducted with the CAM5.1 We find no evidence that the delayed onset of the wet season over Nigeria during April-May   Nat-Hist anthropogenic forcings are set to circa year 1850 values, while observed ocean temperatures and sea ice are cooled by spatially-and time-varying amount based on atmosphere-ocean models in the CMIP5 archive (Stone and Pall 2016, unpublished manuscript). In addition to substantial algorithmic differences, there are some distinctions in the setup between the models: MIROC5 uses prescribed aerosol precursor emissions, while CAM5.1 uses prescribed aerosol burdens, relevant here as simulated precipitation over West Africa can be sensitive to the regional aerosol forcing (Tompkins et al. 2005;Rosenfeld et al. 2008 and. In addition, MIROC5 uses year-1850 land cover for the Nat-Hist simulations, while CAM5.1 uses present-day land cover; land cover/use change is understood to have significant effects on rainfall and atmospheric variables such as midtropospheric wind speed, daily extreme temperatures, specific humidity, evapo-transpiration, etc., over Nigeria (Abiodun et al. 2008;Dirmeyer et al. 2010;Christidis et al. 2013). Given that monitoring of seasonal climate and the impacts of its variability over Nigeria is based on precipitation, we focus on April and May precipitation here. Anomalies are calculated from the 1981-2010 precipitation climatology for all data sources. Furthermore, ITD are calculated from the dewpoint observations obtained from NiMet data archive and from output of the CAM5.1 and MIROC5 simulations. Relative to the observed climatology, both models tend to have a northward bias in the ITD during the first half of the year, including the onset period, with the CAM5.1 ITD advancing a bit faster than observed during the onset season (Figs.  13.2a,b). Beyond this bias, the positions of the ITD in both models closely follow the observed climatological positions throughout the year, and the range of year-to-year variability is comparable to the observed range. Lawal (2015) found that CAM5.1 is capable of representing the dominant circulation processes during the wet season. Results. The results from both models suggest that anthropogenic inf luences may have moderately (CAM5.1) or slightly (MIROC5) decreased the chance for low April rainfall and not altered the chances for low May rains (Table 13.1). The confidence intervals about these estimates however, are large, and the pos-sible difference in April drought frequencies could have resulted from random sampling. The estimates of the risk ratio (the ratio of the probabilities in 2015 between the All-Hist and Nat-Hist ensembles of being drier than the 10th percentile of the All-Hist simulations during the 1981-2010 periods) are less than 1.0 in April while the estimates are close to 1.0 in May (Table 13.1). In addition, the simulations suggest little spatial structure in the influence of anthropogenic emissions on the chance of low April-May 2015 precipitation (Figs. 13.2c-f); low risk ratios in the northern regions in April are not robust due to the low rainfall usually experienced there. While anthropogenic inf luence may not have substantially affected the chance of the late onset, the influence of the naturally occurring anomalies in SSTs may be different. Figures 13.1d,e show that the observed SSTs (www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data /gridded/data.kaplan_sst.html; Kaplan et al. 1998;) over the Gulf of Guinea were warmer than normal during April-May 2015. Under these warmer-thannormal SST conditions, it should have been possible to advect sufficient moisture to support precipitation (Zheng et al. 1999;Odekunle and Eludoyin 2008). It would also be expected that the moisture laden southwesterly trade winds would have become more energized, buoyant, and capable of dynamically pushing the ITD deeply into the northern end of the country, thereby resulting in above-normal rainfall both at the coastal and inland parts of the country (Omotosho and Abiodun 2007). However, both models suggest that anomalous SSTs had little effect on the chance of low May 2015 precipitation while they indicate that anomalous SSTs might in fact have decreased the chance of low April 2015 precipitation over the country relative to amounts experienced during the previous eight years (risk ratio \u2212P All-Hist /P 2007-2014 , with the 2007-14 period used because of the availability of ~100-member ensembles with both models; Table  13.1) and, in a statistically significant manner for CAM5.1, relative to the 1981-2010 climatology (not shown). This is consistent with the shift in ITD position in CAM5.1's All-Hist 2015 simulations relative to the 1981-2010 climatology (Fig. 13.2a). The results for soil moisture are similar to those of SSTs (not shown). Both models suggest that both the anthropogenic emissions and anomalous SSTs decreased the chance of dry soil (upper 10 cm) in May 2015, but they are also consistent with no influence. This suggests little effect of temperature on Nigerian soil moisture in a warming climate.

The WBGT in August was a maximum for 2015 and was greater than the 5-95 percentile range of previous years (1984-2014; blue region). Here, the heat wave is defined as starting when the 5-95 percentile in WBGT is exceeded for at least 5 days and ends when the WBGT drops below the 5-95 percentile without exceeding it in the subsequent 5 days. The heat wave event is marked with orange arrows on Fig. 14.1b. While the primary reason for the high WBGT is the high temperatures over this period, the high relative humidity levels (for the given temperature levels) were also important. Around half of the heat wave days had this combination with the other half having approximately average relative humidity levels for the respective temperature levels (Fig. 14.1c). A reasonable hypothesis would be that this event was made more likely due to human-induced climate change because the observed August WBGT has a significant positive trend over Egypt (Fig. 14.1d, red line). To test this, model simulations of the 2015 climate over the region are employed. The modeled bias in WBGT is first examined using ~100 ensemble members spanning 1987-2012 ( Fig. 14.1c, black lines). This period is chosen because it is the length of time that the required observed SST forcing data are available for the model simulations. The multiensemble mean of the simulations shows a similar trend in WBGT to observations, as can be seen in Fig. 14.1d. Compared with the observed data, the model performs remarkably well for mean climate with the bias in WBGT over this period being 0.007\u00b0C. However, larger biases are observed in the mean temperatures with the model being 1.88\u00b0C too warm; and for relative humidity, the model is ~8% too dry. Therefore, the well-simulated mean WBGT in the model is partially due to compensating errors from the temperature and relative humidity being biased in opposing directions (as relevant for heat stress). The variance of daily temperature and WBGT are "}, {"section_title": "S72", "text": "DECEMBER 2016 | also well reproduced (not shown) although there are large low biases in the variance of modeled-relative humidity (\u03c3 obs / \u03c3 mod = 1.89). Before the event is assessed, the monthly mean and daily variability about the mean for temperature, relative humidity, and WBGT are corrected to match observations at each station location. For temperature, this has been performed in Hempel et al. (2013). Applying their procedure to relative humidity and WBGT also proves to be an adequate bias correction, perhaps, unsurprisingly, as both variables evolve in a similar fashion to temperature. (Note that calculating WBGT from the bias-corrected variables yields almost identical results as calculating WBGT from the raw variables and then bias-correcting. In this assessment, the latter method is used.) To understand the 19-day event (e.g., Fig. 14.1b) more completely, the coevolution of temperature and relative humidity is contrasted with WBGT. Figure  14.2 shows the 2D histograms of modeled, 19-day averaged, relative humidity, and temperature over Egypt for the actual scenario (Fig. 14.2a) and the natural scenario (Fig. 14.2b). Figures 14.2d,e show the same but for Cairo only. The black lines show the observed thresholds during the event, and hence model data that fall to the upper-right of these thresholds are more extreme than the observed event. It is clear that more model data exceed the observed threshold in the actual scenario than in the natural. This is true for Egypt as a whole, and specifically for Cairo, and confirms the hypothesis that human-induced climate change has made this event more likely. Performing the same comparison on the WBGT (Figs. 14.2c,f for Egypt and Cairo, respectively) supports this conclusion. To quantify the level of anthropogenic contribution to the event, the fraction of attributable risk (FAR) is used. This is defined, as in  as 1 \u2212 (P Nat / P Act ), where P Nat is the probability of exceeding the event in the natural scenario, and P Act is the probability of exceeding the event in the actual scenario.

While the heat wave center of action was in the south of Egypt (e.g., Haaretz 2015), Cairo (in the north) experienced slightly higher temperatures due to the urban heat island effect (e.g., Heaviside et al. 2015). Luckily, like Cairo, most of Egypt's population resides in the north, with 9 out of 10 of the largest cities (by population) being located there. Had the heat wave been more focused over the north, the death toll could have been far higher. Conclusions and discussions. In this study, an analysis of heat stress was undertaken for the 2015 Egyptian heat wave. It was found that over Egypt the event was made 69% (\u00b1 17%) more likely due to anthropogenic climate change, and this was a similar value of 67% (\u00b1 7%) when only Cairo was considered. The principal driver of human discomfort was high temperature, but relatively high humidity levels for those given temperatures also played a role for around half of the heat wave. It is noted that the daily variance of relative humidity is bias-low in this region. This is especially relevant for the developing regions of the world, as an increased exceedance of critical thresholds (such as the temperature at which the human body can still transfer heat to the surrounding) will be among the most important impacts felt for society under climate change (Pal and Eltahir 2015). This is especially true for high-mitigation scenarios, such as those presented in the 2015 Paris Agreement, because impacts on society will be largely felt through changes in extremes (Mitchell et al. 2016b). While assessing human health under climate change is of particular importance in this region, it also presents unique challenges. This analysis focuses only on a physical heat stress measure of human discomfort and does not take into account social aspects (e.g., Klinenberg 2002). To do this, a full epidemiological analysis is needed in the first instance (as in Mitchell et al. 2016a). However, while in the context of Africa, meteorological data over Egypt are surprisingly abundant, reliable, and freely available, epidemiological data (such as all-cause mortality) are not. Nevertheless, this study represents a step in understanding health impacts of climate change in the region, and it is hoped that this study and others like it will prompt local governments to make national-level health data more widely available to the outside community.

(Funk et al. 2015b) data indicated one of the worst droughts in more than 50 years (FEWSNET 2015). More than ten million people currently require humanitarian relief (FEWSNET 2016a). SA rains were also extremely poor (FEWSNET 2016b); in Mozambique and Malawi, February maize prices were more than twice the five-year average, and in Zimbabwe the president has declared a national disaster in view of the El Ni\u00f1o-induced poor rains and the escalating food insecurity situation. NE has been experiencing long-term rainfall declines (Funk et al. 2008;Funk et al. 2005;Jury and Funk 2013;Viste et al. 2012;Williams et al. 2012). The eastern Ethiopian highlands have exhibited recurrent soil moisture and runoff deficits since the 1990s (Funk et al. 2015c). NE rains in 2015 were the driest on record, but station data density prior to 1950 is very sparse for Ethiopia (Funk et al. 2015b). SA rainfall does not exhibit a decline, but the 2015-16 drought was severe. The impact of ENSO on Ethiopian rainfall is well documented (Fig. S15.1 Fig. S15.1; Hoell et al. 2015;Jury et al. 1994;Lindesay 1988;Misra 2003;Nicholson and Entekhabi 1986;Nicholson and Kim 1997;Reason et al. 2000;Rocha and Simmonds 1997)."}, {"section_title": "S75", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Is Anthropogenic Climate Change Causing More Extreme", "text": "El Ni\u00f1os? Our attribution approach is similar to our 2014 study (Funk et al. 2015a) examining boreal spring rainfall deficits in Kenya and southeastern Ethiopia. We first assess changes in Ni\u00f1o-3.4 SST extremes based on climate change simulations and then interpret these results using empirical relationships between Ni\u00f1o-3.4 SSTs and regional rainfall and air temperatures. Figures 15.1a,b examine JJAS and DJF Ni\u00f1o-3.4 SSTs (Huang et al. 2015) from observations (blue/red bars) and a multimodel climate change ensemble (red lines and blue shading; SST simulations from 19 model combinations and 34 simulations; 2006-15 simulation values were based on the RCP8.5 experiment; for details see https:// climexp.knmi.nl) based on simulations from 1861 through 2100. For each of the 34 simulations, for each year, the top six Ni\u00f1o-3.4 SST events from the surrounding 30 years typified El Ni\u00f1o. The heavy red lines depict the ensemble average of these values for each year. The thin red lines identify the 80% confidence interval associated with the ensemble spread. The climate change distribution agrees reasonably well with the observed increasing strength of moderate-strong Ni\u00f1o-3.4 events.

For DJF and JJAS, this gives us an estimated change of +1.2\u00b0C. Using the 80% confidence intervals for 2015-16 and repeating this calculation lets us establish a range of values \u2206T DJF = +1.2\u00b0 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C and \u2206T JJAS = +1.1\u00b0 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C. We next examine three atmospheric GCM simulation ensembles, drawn from the Earth Systems Research Laboratory Facility for Climate Assessments (FACTS; see www .esrl.noaa.gov/psd/repository /alias/facts). Using FACTS, we examined differences between 1980-2015 and 1920-79 moderate-to-strong El Ni\u00f1os, using atmospheric General Circulation Model (AGCM) simulations. Figures 15.1c,d show results for a single model for DJF. Supplemental Fig.  S15.2 shows similar results for all three models for both seasons. Over the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans (Fig.  15.1c), recent El Ni\u00f1os have been associated with much warmer conditions (> +0.8\u00b0C), consistent with Figs. 15.1a,b, but have also been potentially influenced by natural decadal variability (Wittenberg 2009). Accompanying the warming is a very large (70%+) Fig. 15.1.

The magnitude of El Ni\u00f1o precipitation increases over the eastern Pacific would strongly influence El Ni\u00f1o's atmospheric forcing strength, and we find a precipitation decline (Fig. 15.1d) over southern Africa that is broadly consistent with our empirical analysis. Results from two other models and JJAS are similar (Supplemental Fig. S15.2). Estimating Rainfall and Air Temperature Changes due to El Ni\u00f1o. Figures 15.1e,f show regressions between NE/SA rainfall and Ni\u00f1o-3.4 SSTs. Our study regions were chosen based on historical teleconnections (Supplemental Figs. S15.1e,f) and the pattern of the 2015-16 deficits. In Ethiopia and southern Africa, Ni\u00f1o-3.4 SSTs explained 45% and 53% of the 1981-82 to 2015-16 rainfall variance, respectively. While rainfall performance varied substantially during strong El Ni\u00f1os (the 1997-98 response was relatively modest in both regions), the observations suggest that a 1\u00b0C increase in El Ni\u00f1o-3.4 SSTs produces a 79 mm and 62 mm decrease in NE and SA rainfall, respectively. These regressions slopes suggest that without anthropogenic Ni\u00f1o-3.4 warming, NE and SA rainfall would have been approximately 16% and 24% greater, respectively. ENSO teleconnections and warming trends were used to estimate anthropogenic air temperature changes of +0.9\u00b0C (Supplemental Material). Using the lower bounds of Ni\u00f1o-3.4 SST change (T JJAS =0.6\u00b0C, T DJF =0.7\u00b0C) gives estimates of a 9% and 14% rainfall change and a 0.8\u00b0C and 0.7\u00b0C JJAS/DJF air temperature change in NE and SA, respectively. Contrapositive Hydrologic Experiment. We performed four hydrologic experiments using the variable inf i ltration capacit y (VIC) model. In t hese experiments, we drove the VIC model with (i) "}, {"section_title": "S78", "text": "DECEMBER 2016 | observed weather forcings, (ii) weather forcing in which we increased NE/SA precipitation by 16% and 24%, (iii) weather forcings with air temperatures cooled by +0.9\u00b0C/+0.9\u00b0C NE/SA, and (iv) weather forcings with both (i) and (ii) changes. Figure 15.2 shows results for experiments (ii) -(iv), expressed as anomalies from (i). Our contrapositive NE runoff changes, in our region of interest, for (ii)-(iv) were: +35%, +1%, +37%; for SA (ii)-(iv) changes were: +48%, +1%, +49%. Clearly, anthropogenic disruptions in precipitation, associated with the large increases in ENSO SST (Figs. 15.1a,b), provided the dominant contribution. As was the case for 2014 (Funk et al. 2015a), we find that a ~1\u00b0C warming over the tropical Pacific can have a much greater impact than a ~1\u00b0C warming in local air temperatures. Conclusions. Anthropogenic warming contributed substantially to the very warm 2015/16 El Ni\u00f1o SSTs, and this anthropogenic contribution likely reduced NE and SA rainfall by approximately 16% and 24%. The associated simulated runoff reductions were much larger, 35% and 48%, respectively. A ~1\u00b0C warming over the tropical Pacific appears associated with a large (>70%) increase in El Ni\u00f1o diabatic forcing (Fig. 15.1f), and modest (~20%) precipitation reductions over NE/SA. These \"modest\" rainfall reductions, acting to accentuate natural El Ni\u00f1o impacts, have contributed to substantial food crises. Recent El Ni\u00f1os appear to be more intense (Supplemental Fig. S15.2). During El Ni\u00f1os, warmer Indo-Pacific SSTs, and associated rainfall changes, may be more influential than the direct impacts of local increases in air temperatures. The contrast between Figs. 15.2a,b and 15.2d,e tell us that, based on these hydrologic simulations, nonlocal warming in the tropical Pacific had a much stronger drought impact than did relatively small local air temperature impacts. We feel this result is quite important, possibly indicating that a major mode of \"climate change\" may be associated with more extreme tropical SST and SST gradients. \"Global warming\" expressed as local increases in air temperatures may have less dramatic impacts. Assessments (Brown et al. 2015) of local temperature impacts on crop yields suggest relatively small yield reductions per degree of warming (~2% per \u00b0C). A degree of warming in Ni\u00f1o-3.4 SSTs, concomitant with a warm ENSO event, can have larger impacts due to teleconnected precipitation declines. Because runoff forms a relatively small fraction of the hydrologic balance, the influence of rainfall deficits can be amplified, potentially leading to severe hydropower shortages (Davison 2015;Onishi 2016) and even severe drinking water deficits (Gauette 2016). These crises are just one aspect of the widespread food insecurity related to the extreme 2015/16 El Ni\u00f1o (Fig. 15.1), which is thought to have contributed to the severe food insecurity of 60 million people \"primarily in the most vulnerable regions of southern Africa, East Africa, Central America, and the Pacific Islands\" (OCHA 2016). If La Ni\u00f1a conditions follow, extreme warming in the western Pacific may lead to dry conditions over equatorial East Africa (Funk et al. 2015a;Funk et al. 2014;Shukla et al. 2014 (Fig. 16.1a). By late June, the Indian monsoon was well developed, curtailing these winds and terminating the heat wave (see www .tropmet.res.in/~lip/Publication/Scientific-Reports /RR-185.pdf). In Pakistan by this time, winds were onshore (Fig. 16.1b), and the unusually hot conditions were also unusually humid. The high numbers of deaths in both events are attributed not only to the weather conditions but also to institutional failures. Hospitals were overwhelmed with patients suffering from heat-related symptoms and at some point had to turn away patients (Salim et al. 2015). It is difficult to be precise about the ultimate number of fatalities associated with these heat waves, but upwards of 2500 excess deaths are estimated to have occurred in the Indian heat wave (Ratnam et al. 2016) and at least 700 alone in the Pakistani megacity of Karachi (Masood et al. 2015) with many more throughout the country. To further characterize these heat waves, we have analyzed 1973-2015 subdaily (hourly and 3-hourly) temperature and heat index (Steadman 1979a,b) calculated from the HadISD v1.0.4.2015p quality controlled weather station dataset (Dunn et al. 2012). Heat index, one of several methods to measure the combined effect of temperature and humidity on human health, is a bicubic function of both variables intended to fit a model of a fully clothed adult (see Supplemental Material for its definition). Figures  16.1c,d show the daily maximum instantaneous heat index (thick red lines) and the temperature (thick black lines) associated with it during the heat waves in Hyderabad (in the Indian state of Telangana, WMO station number 431280) and Karachi (the largest city in Pakistan, WMO station number 417800). The pentadal averages of these daily maxima are shown with thin lines. Climatological averages over 1974-2014 are shown with horizontal dotted lines for May in Hyderabad and June in Karachi to show the events' relative severity. In Hyderabad, the daily maximum heat index was about 2\u00b0-4\u00b0C higher than temperature during the heat wave. In Karachi, this difference was about 7\u00b0-12\u00b0C, reflecting a much higher relative humidity. The first column of "}, {"section_title": "S82", "text": "DECEMBER 2016 | mum heat index (indicated by the large black dot) is well within the advisory levels revealing that these U.S.-based statements were not developed for these regions. More widely applicable measures of the threat of severe heat wave to human health are not available (Wehner et al. 2016). Rare and dangerous events are along the upper-right edge of this two-dimensional distribution, which are not necessarily the highest temperatures. The 2015 heat waves are represented by asterisks. These figures reveal stark differences in both the heat waves and climatologies of the two cities. In Hyderabad, the 2015 heat wave was among the highest temperatures ever experienced but relative humidity was low, around 20%. In Karachi, the 2015 heat wave was hot but not near record levels. However, because relative humidity was high (35%-70%), the daily maximum heat indices were among the highest ever experienced. These combinations of temperature and relative humidity were rare events as is evident by the proximity of the asterisks to the edge of the distribution in Fig. 16.2b. Analysis of possible human influence. The annual maxima of the pentadal average of the daily maximum heat indices and associated temperatures exhibit increasing trends for both stations (thin red lines in Supplemental Figs. S16.1a,b). To account for this, we use a nonstationary peaks over threshold extreme value methodology (Coles 2001) to fit a generalized Pareto distribution in order to estimate timedependent return periods for high daily and pentadal values. To incorporate the effect of anthropogenic climate change, we used a time varying estimate of CO 2 (see www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/) as the covariate in the Pareto distribution using a 95th percentile threshold and a 3-week declustering. Using the event magnitudes in the first column of Table 16.1, we find a strong time dependence of the temperature and heat index return periods (Supplemental Figs. S16.1c,d) for the pentadal values. Very little time dependence in the return periods for the daily values for the Karachi station over the duration of the observational record is found, consistent with the "}, {"section_title": "S83", "text": "DECEMBER 2016 AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY | absence of a significant trend in the extrema of daily maxima for that station (thick lines in Supplemental Fig. S16.2b). Return periods of high temperature and head index in Hyderabad exhibit strong time dependence for both the daily and pentadal values, also consistent with relative magnitude of the trends and variations of Supplemental Fig. S16.1a. The 2015 values of return periods corresponding to estimated event magnitudes are shown in the second numeric column of Table 16.1. Because the CO 2 covariate is clearly dependent on human activities, there is a statistically significant relationship between human influence and the heat index. However, because the statistical model does not consider that unforced natural variations may be coincidental with increases in atmospheric CO 2 , this statistical significance does not necessarily mean that an anthropogenic response has been detected by this analysis alone. To more rigorously estimate a possible human influence, we utilize simulations drawn from the C20C+ Detection and Attribution Subproject (Folland et al. 2014). Temperature and relative humidity were extracted from the grid points nearest to the Hyderabad and Karachi airport weather stations from two 98-member ensemble simulations of the Community Atmospheric Model (CAM5.1) at a resolution of approximately 100 km (Risser et al. 2016, unpublished manuscript, available online at https:// arxiv.org/abs/1606.08908). Simulations from 1996-2015 driven by observed sea surface temperatures and sea ice distributions represent the \"world that was,\" referred to here as \"actual.\" A counterfactual \"world that might have been\" set of simulations represents the climate system had humans not altered the composition of the atmosphere (Folland et al. 2014). In this case, an estimate of the human-induced changes to the sea surface temperature and sea ice distribution obtained from the CMIP5 models is removed from the lower boundary conditions and atmospheric trace gas and aerosol concentrations set to preindustrial values (Stone 2013). Comparison of model grid points to individual weather stations is performed with caution. Hyderabad Airport is located in the countryside well outside of the metropolitan area, and thus should be representative of temperature variations occurring on spatial scales resolved by the climate model. Karachi Airport is, however, located within the metropolitan area, and Karachi itself is a coastal city, so the climate model may not be properly resolving urban and coastal microclimate phenomena that are influencing weather at the airport. However, the pair of ensemble simulations use the same changes in land use and cover, so differences are predominantly a result of changes in atmospheric composition and ocean state rather than in the urban heat island. The model was determined to be fit for purpose by the tests outlined in Ang\u00e9lil et al. (2016a). Ang\u00e9lil et al. 2016b conclude that CAM5.1's estimates of the   "}, {"section_title": "S84", "text": "DECEMBER 2016 | 1-in-1-year and 1-in-10-year anomalous thresholds for hot days over India/Pakistan are all consistent with estimates from current reanalysis products. Figures 16.2c,d show histograms approximating the simulations' distribution of the pentadal average of the daily maximum heat index for the counterfactual world (blue) and actual world (red) during the month of the two heat waves' peak intensity and reveal a pronounced shift toward higher values caused by the changes in forcing due to anthropogenic activities. Corresponding histograms for the daily maximum heat index and for both measures of extreme temperature are shown in Supplemental Fig. S16.2. For both locations, the models' response in extreme temperature is less than in heat index but the profound difference in the daily and pentadal Karachi observational extremes revealed by changes in return period (Supplemental Figs. S16.1c,d) are not readily apparent in the simulations. Utilizing the quantile bias correction method of Jeon et al. 2015, we estimate the changes in return period for corrected daily and pentadal values of peak temperature and heat index for both heat waves. This is used to define the \"risk ratio,\" the ratio of the probabilities of reaching the corrected model estimates of the observed event in the factual and counterfactual simulations or, more simply, the inverse of the ratio of the corresponding return periods. Shown in Table 16.1, we find a substantial human increase in the risk ratio of heat index for both the Indian and Pakistani heat waves. The heat index risk ratio is substantially larger for pentadal values than it is for daily values. This is particularly relevant to assessing human-induced changes in the heat wave-related risk Fig. 16.2.

Changes in simulated return values corresponding to the estimated observed return time are also shown in the last column of Table 16.1, revealing large humaninduced changes in the magnitude of heat waves of a fixed rarity for both cities. We note that the climate model simulation (not shown) does not exhibit as large a trend in the estimated return periods of temperature and heat index as some of the HadISD observational products. However, the sampling uncertainty of the observations, represented by the error bars in Supplemental Figs.  S16.1c,d, is large and the model is not necessarily inconsistent with the observations in this regard. Sampling uncertainty is much lower in the model because of the size of the ensemble dampens the inherent natural variability. In the simulations, the human signal is larger for the heat index than for temperature over both the daily and pentadal extremal measures at both locations (Table 16.1). We also find that for heat index, the human influence is greater on the pentadal scales than on the daily scales but that it is about the same for temperature at both locations. The time dependence of the Karachi observations could also be described this way, although there is essentially no trend in the daily extrema (Supplemental Figs.  S16.1b,d). The time dependence of the Hyderabad observations is also similar except for the large change in the daily temperature (Supplemental Figs. S16.1a,c). Jeon et al. (2015) demonstrated that risk ratio estimates for heat waves could be relatively insensitive to uncertainty in observed event magnitude. Hence, the principal uncertainties in the estimates of risk ratio and return value changes for heat wave occurrence in Table 16.1 stem from the use of a single climate model as well as the single estimate of counterfactual ocean state rather than observational uncertainty."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion.

This anthropogenic influence is found to be higher for pentadal than for daily measures of heat wave severity, with potential implications for human health and mortality because of their dependence on heat wave duration.

(Fig. 17.1a). The city was declared a disaster area on 2 December after many areas, including the airport, were flooded. Although in the satellite-based CMORPH analysis the largest precipitation amounts were recorded south of Chennai (Fig. 17.1b), we concentrate our analysis on this city because the impact was largest here. Damages were estimated to be as high as $3 billion (U.S. dollars; Wall Street Journal, 11 December 2015). This part of India has its main rainy season during the northeast monsoon (Srinivasan and Ramamurthy 1973;Yadav 2013) in October-December. Sea surface temperature (SST) in the Bay of Bengal typically exceeds the threshold for deep convection throughout the year. Weak vertical shear during May and October-December (months prior to and immediately following the southwest monsoon) makes conditions ideal for tropical storms and cyclones that make landfall on the southeastern coast of India. The extreme rainfall events have sizes of O(100) km. SST in the northern and western Bay of Bengal has hardly increased over the last 35 years, in contrast to most of the rest of the world (Fig. 17.1c). This is likely because of increased air pollution in the region, the \"brown cloud,\" that blocks more sunlight counteracting the warming due to greenhouse gases, especially in premonsoon maximum temperatures (Padma Kumari et al. 2007;Wild 2012). The CMIP5 historical greenhouse gas (GHG) experiments without aerosols indeed indicate a larger trend in the Bay of Bengal (sea points in 10\u00b0-25\u00b0N, 80\u00b0-90\u00b0E), 1.6\u00b0C (100 yr) \u22121 over October-December from 1970 to 2005, than the historical experiments, 1.3\u00b0C (100 yr) \u22121 . This is still higher than the observed trend of 0.8\u00b0C (100 yr) \u22121 . In line with this, SST anomalies were lower than elsewhere in the Indian Ocean in November-December 2015, although there was a warmer patch just off the coast of Chennai with 0.6\u00b0-0.8\u00b0C anomalies (Fig. 17.1d). El Ni\u00f1o was also very strong these months. Observational analysis. We analyze two datasets of daily station precipitation in the region. The public GHCN-D dataset (Menne et al. 2016) has 50 stations with at least 40 years of data in the area 10\u00b0-15\u00b0N, 79.5\u00b0-81\u00b0E for a total of 3504 station-years. These coastal stations have similar climatologies of the wettest day of the year (RX1day). However, all but two of the series end in 1970. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) provided us with 19 nonpublic series with mean RX1day > 90 mm from the region for 1969-2013. Five of these did not have more than one or two years of valid data. One station had zeroes all through the wet season in a few years and was also discarded. Seven stations had monthly mean totals in 2001-04 that were about a factor of 10 smaller than satellite data; these years were deleted. A few very high precipitation amounts (\u2265 500 mm) were on dry or moderately rainy days at other stations or in the satellite record and did not show up in flood records, so they were removed (displaced decimal points are common). After this quality-control procedure, 407 station years with at least 80% valid data in October-December remained. Both datasets were analyzed Extreme one-day rainfall caused widespread flooding in Chennai, India, in December 2015.

The uncertainties were estimated using a nonparametric bootstrap that takes spatial correlations into account with a 2D moving-block procedure analogous to the 1D one for temporal autocorrelations. Both datasets show that the 494 mm observed in the Tambaram suburb is a rare event, with return times of 600-2500 years (95% confidence interval; GHCN-D, assuming a stationary climate) and 300-4000 years (IMD; current climate, red lines in Fig. 17.2a) respectively. This means that the odds of receiving such extreme precipitation at a givenstation are less than 0.2% each year. The chance of such an amount occurring at any station in the region is higher. The rainfall in this area has around 5 degrees of freedom, so the return time for such a high amount in any rain gauge is five times lower. In fact, there is one The GHCN-D dataset (mainly up to 1970) shows no trend, whereas the IMD dataset shows a nonsignificant negative trend starting in 1969, see Figs. 17.2a,b.

A similar analysis using the Ni\u00f1o-3.4 index as covariate rather than time shows that there is a slight increase during El Ni\u00f1o, which is not significant at p < 0.1 (one-sided). Total November-December precipitation is very weakly correlated with the Ni\u00f1o-3.4 index (r = 0.18, correlations reach r > 0.4 further south along the coast). There is a stronger connection between mean precipitation and SST in the Bay of Bengal (10\u00b0-25\u00b0N, 80\u00b0-95\u00b0E, r = 0.30), which supports our hypothesis that the lack of trend in this area over the last 40 years is responsible for the lack of trend in extreme precipitation.

We analyzed the rainfall extremes in a relatively high-resolution ensemble of model runs, 16 historical/RCP 8.5 experiments using the EC-Earth 2.3 model (Hazeleger et al. 2010) at T159, about 150-km resolution. This model shows a strong positive trend in SST over the Bay of Bengal of about 0.2\u00b0C (10 yr \u22121 ) over 1975-2015, which contradicts the observed trend. We therefore do not consider its modeled increase in the probability of high RX1day by a factor 1.6-6 (95% CI). The CMIP5 ensemble contains many models with a hard upper boundary of rainfall in the grid box corresponding to Chennai, in contrast to the observed probability distribution function (PDF; Fig. 17.2b), hence we could not use it either."}, {"section_title": "Regional climate model.", "text": "We furthermore analyze the rainfall extremes in the regional atmosphere-only general circulation model HadRM3P, used in the weather@home distributed computing framework (Massey et al. 2015).

Quantile-quantile assessments of the modeled precipitation reveal a small overestimation of the absolute values of precipitation but good representation of the overall distribution. Pressure over the region of interest is consistently underestimated. Because the biases in the model seem to be mainly an offset and we are comparing the model with itself in terms of magnitudes, we refrain from applying a bias correction. The SST difference between actual and preindustrial situations in the Bay of Bengal is about 0.5\u00b0C (Schaller et al. 2016, their Supplemental Fig. S17.3), in line with the observed trend. To derive results comparable to the statistical analysis of the 19 stations described previously, we analyze daily maximum grid box precipitation in the October to November period over the region 10\u00b0-15\u00b0N, 77\u00b0-82\u00b0E. Comparing the two ensemble simulations for 2015 ( Fig. 17.2c), we find again a nonsignificant negative change in the likelihood of extreme precipitation events with a return time above 100 years due to anthropogenic emissions. Comparing the simulations of 2015 with an ensemble of simulations of daily extreme rainfall from 1985 to 2014 reveals a small positive influence of the observed SST patterns on the likelihood of extreme rainfall. The analysis does not allow us to estimate the influence of the observed El Ni\u00f1o, only the global SST patterns. Qualitatively, the results are robust under different possible ways of characterizing the event spatially and temporally, by excluding the westernmost parts of the region or analyzing monthly data. Discussion and conclusions. The observational analysis found no signal for a positive trend in extreme oneday precipitation at the southeastern coast of India over 1900-70, nor over 1970-2014. Coupled models show more extreme one-day precipitation events from 1970-2015, but a large ensemble of SST-forced models again shows no increase in the probability of extreme one-day precipitation due to anthropogenic emissions. A plausible factor is the lack of increase in SST in the western Bay of Bengal over the last 40 years, which is not reproduced correctly by the coupled models but is more realistic in the SST-forced model. This precludes an attribution of the floods to anthropogenic factors, probably to a large extent due to the two main pollutants, greenhouse gases and aerosols, having opposing effects. Over land this opposition is discussed by Padma Kumari et al. (2007) and Wild (2012). There is a small but clear increase in probability of extremes in the SST-forced regional model, associated with El Ni\u00f1o and other SST anomalies.

Supplemental Fig. S18.1 plots daily rainfall intensity distribution for the regions of southeast China. We perform a Kolmogrov-Smirnoff test (KS) for each region to determine how well the observed distribution of daily rainfall is reproduced by the ensemble mean-the results of this are indicated in the supplement. Nine of the 12 regions showed more than 95% likelihood of the observed and modeled distributions being drawn from the same population; an additional two regions showed 86%. Region 10 showed only 72% likelihood and was excluded from further analysis. The model can reproduce the mean and extremes of precipitation totals, intensities, number of rainy days in a month, and numbers of consecutive days of rain sufficiently well for the attribution study intended here. Results. We select the top 10% of n_day_tot rainfall to be defined as extreme events and examine the change in intens and n_days over which this rain fell. The values for observed n_days, n_day_tot, and intens are shown in Supplemental Fig. S18.2 for all years including 2015. Following , we take the most recent 15 years of model data (1999-2013) as representative of current climatology to produce probability distribution functions (PDF) for intens and n_days. The PDF is calculated by fitting a gamma function to the normalized model histogram of the rainfall metric examined; we test the appropriateness of this fit in the supplement. PDFs allow the calculation of fraction of attributable risk (FAR; Allen 2003), defined as FAR = 1 \u2212 (P(NAT) / P(ALL)) for individual regions. We calculate FAR for intensity of events greater than the May 2015 observed maximum, providing an estimate of the extent to which human influence has increased the risk of high-total-rainfall events with daily intensity as high as observed in May 2015. We also calculate FAR for the number of consecutive days of rain less than the maximum value observed for May 2015, providing an estimate of the extent to which human influence has increased the risk of having high-total-rainfall events with duration as short as in May 2015. To calculate the error on FAR, we bootstrap resample (with replacement) the top 10% of n_day_tot for the all-forcings and natural-forcings models then refit the PDFs 1000 times for both intens and n_days. The standard deviation of the FAR from the 1000 bootstrapped samples gives the error on FAR. We exclude regions 6 and 10 from analysis (see model verification) and report results for the remaining 10 regions. We find positive FAR in 4 out of 10 and 9 out of 10 regions for intens and n_days, respectively. The four regions for which intens showed positive FAR-7, 8, 11, and 12-are all spatially adjacent to each other; these and all the coastal regions show positive FAR for n_days. The spatial contiguity of regions with positive FAR makes it more likely that these results are physically caused rather than a statistical fluke. Three regions show positive FAR at 2\u03c3 in one metric and 1\u03c3 in the other; we focus our analysis on those. We find positive FAR at 2\u03c3 confidence for increase in intens and 1\u03c3 confidence for decrease in n_days in regions 7 and 12. We find positive FAR at 2\u03c3 confidence for decrease in n_days and 1\u03c3 confidence for increase in intens for region 11. We also find positive FAR for regions 8 and 9 at 1\u03c3 confidence for n_days. We present results for regions 7, 11, and 12 in Fig. 18.2. For the top 10% of n_day_tot, we find anthropogenic climate change has increased the likelihood of intense rainfall, greater than or equal to that observed in May 2015, by 64% \u00b1 17%, 23% \u00b1 12%, and 66% \u00b1 19% for regions 7, 11, and 12, respectively. For the same regions, we find anthropogenic influence increases likelihood by 12% \u00b1 11%, 39% \u00b1 14%, and 23% \u00b1 14%, respectively, of a decrease in the number of consecutive days over which the rain fell with respect to the maximum number of consecutive days observed in May 2015. Some studies show that the Pacific sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) is an important factor affecting the early rainy-season precipitation in southern China (e.g., Qiang and Yang 2013).

Two categories were assessed: anthropogenic variations in GHG and natural forcing (Fig. 19.2b). Uncertainty ranges (5-95%) for the scaling factors were evaluated via Monte Carlo simulations. If the scaling factor for a forcing simulation was significantly greater than zero, then the influence of that forcing on the variable (i.e., July TMX) is detected . 4) To analyze the attributable risk, we employed the conventional fraction of attributable risk (FAR = 1\u2212 P nat /P all ) method (Stone and Allen 2005;Stott et al. 2015). We compared the probability of the observed 2015 July mean TMX anomaly occurring in the all forcing (P all ) and natural forcing (P nat ) simulations to ascertain the contribution of anthropogenic climate change. Bootstrapping (with replacement) was performed 1000 times per period to estimate the FAR uncertainty (Fig. 19.2c). 5) To test causality, we applied Granger causality analysis (GCA; Granger 1969). We examined the impact of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on the monthly mean TMX during the period of 1961-2015 (Supplemental Fig. S19.1). The fundamental concept in GCA is that if the prediction of X (monthly mean TMX) is improved by including Y (here, the monthly ENSO index) as a predictor, then Y is said to be Granger causal for X (significance determined by F-test; p < 0.05; Sun et al. 2016). In addition, a contour map for the South Asia high (SAH) was generated to explore its coincidence with the heat events. Figure 19.1a shows that the July mean TMX in 2015 (32.76\u00b0C) was the highest during the past 55 years and was 2.87\u00b0C higher than the mean TMX during the baseline period . The gray and red lines in the embedded figure in Fig. 19.1b correspond to July mean TMX anomaly during 1961-2014 and in 2015, respectively, relative to the baseline period.

We also found that the most severe changes from baseline in 2015 July mean TMX and heatwave duration were mainly in the middle and northeastern areas of Xinjiang. The heat wave duration was approximately double that of the baseline period (Fig. 19.1d)."}, {"section_title": "Results. B. Analysis of the attributable risk.", "text": "We compared the likelihood of the July mean TMX anomaly occurring in different CMIP5 experiments (Fig.  19.2a). When anthropogenic forcing was included, the probability density function (PDF) shifted to the right, indicating an increased likelihood of high temperatures. The scaling factor for the GHG-forcing simulation, estimated by the regularized optimal fingerprinting method, was 0.41 [90% confidence interval (CI): 0.09-0.76; Fig. 19.2b], suggesting that the changes in area-averaged July mean TMX were responsive to the anthropogenic greenhouse-gases forcing. It was estimated that all PDFs assumed a GEV distribution.

This translates to about three-fold (90% CI: 2.04-5.32) increase in the probability of 2015 July mean TMX anomaly occurring due to anthropogenic influence. The RCP4.5 experiments indicated that the risk from human-induced climate change increases with time, while uncertainty reduces with time ( Fig. 19.2c,  embedded figure).

The 2015 ENSO was one of the strongest since 1960. GCA showed that there was no significant (p = 0.35) causal relationship between area-averaged mean TMX and ENSO index (Supplemental Fig.  S19.1a). However, for 10 stations in central Xinjiang, significant causal relationship (p < 0.05) was detected between TMX changes and ENSO (Supplemental Fig.  S19.1b). The extreme heat events in July 2015 might be also related to the movement of the South Asia high (SAH), which is the most intense and persistent anticyclone system in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere over southern Asia during boreal summer (Mason and Anderson 1963). Less precipitation and heat events usually occur in the region where the SAH moves in . According to the geopotential height anomaly field in July 2015 at 100 hPa, the SAH center moved northward (Fig. 19.2d) and dominated the weather of the entire Xinjiang region, coinciding with the extreme heat events in northwest China. Conclusions. Our analysis of July TMX records over the last 55 years indicates that the record-breaking heat observed over Northwest China in 2015 was at least a 1-in-166-year event. The return period increased to ~200 years if heat wave duration was also taken into account. CMIP5-based FAR analyses suggest that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of such an extreme event by three-fold. The extreme heat event is related to the ENSO and SAH.

Even though the station density is poor in some areas, the available station observations represent the region reasonably well because extreme warm events are of fairly large spatial scale. These data were quality controlled and homogenized with RHtest (Xu et al. 2013) ;Taylor et al. 2012), the simulated TXx and TNx were used to estimate extreme temperature responses to external anthropogenic and natural forcing (ALL), natural forcing only (NAT), and the internal variability of the climate system.

Because the effect of urbanization is not particularly strong in western China, it is not considered in this study. Results. The regional averages of the 2015 summer (June-August) mean and the TXx and TNx in western China (west of 105\u00b0E) were the highest on record beginning in 1958, with 1.54\u00b0C, 2.14\u00b0C, and 2.06\u00b0C above their respective 1961-90 averages (Fig. 20.1b). The long-term changes in the mean and the extreme temperatures are very similar, with the linear trends of 0.28\u00b0C (10 yr) \u22121 for mean temperature, 0.22\u00b0C (10 yr) \u22121 for TXx, and 0.30\u00b0C (10 yr) \u22121 for TNx during 1958-2012, respectively. Warming continued during the so-called global warming hiatus, consistent with the findings of Seneviratne et al. (2014). Figures 20.1c,d show the maps of 2015 summer TXx and TNx anomalies in China, respectively. Both the maxima of daily maximum and daily minimum temperatures were very high in western China with positive anomalies almost everywhere in the region. In particular, the anomalies are generally larger than 3\u00b0C with the maximum above 5\u00b0C in the region north of 35\u00b0N. The 5-year mean time series shows that the evolutions of observed TXx and TNx are consistent with the model-simulated responses to ALL forcing but not with that to NAT forcing (Figs. 20.2a,b). Additionally, the 90% ranges of model-simulated TNx responses to ALL and NAT forcings do not overlap beyond the year 2000. The model-simulated response to NAT forcing shows small positive values near the end of the period, especially for TXx.

Our detection and attribution analyses were conducted on nonoverlapping 5-year mean series. We first regress the observations onto ALL and ALL-NAT (ANT) signals separately (one-signal analyses) and then onto ALL and NAT jointly (two-signal analyses). The one-signal analyses show that the ALL and ANT signals can be detected in the extreme temperatures, and there is no evidence to indicate, from residual consistency tests, that the model may have underestimated natural internal variability. The best estimates of scaling factors for ALL are 0.80 (90% confidence level 0.46-1.14) and 1.20 (90% confidence level 1.00-1.41) for TXx and TNx, consistent with earlier findings (e.g., Zwiers et al. 2011;Kim et al. 2015) for that general region yet over a much larger area. The two-signal detection results indicate that the ANT signal can be separately detected from the NAT signal for both TXx and TNx, and that the NAT signal can be detected in TNx. The scaling factors for ANT and NAT are 0.78 (90% confidence level 0.38-1.18) and 0.89 (90% confidence level \u22120.16-1.95) for TXx and 1.21 (90% confidence level 0.96-1.47) and 1.17 (90% confidence level 0.48-1.87) for TNx, indicating the robustness of detectable human influence on the extreme temperatures. The residual consistency test shows that the model-simulated variability for TXx is consistent with the observed internal variability; however, the model-simulated TNx variability is larger than that of observations. These all suggest that the observed warming in the extreme temperatures are mainly attributable to anthropogenic external forcing rather than natural external forcing. The 2015 summer TXx was 2.14\u00b0C higher than the 1961-90 average. The best estimate of temperature response to ALL forcing at the 2015 climate is 0.88\u00b0C (with a 90% range of 0.51\u00b0C-1.26\u00b0C) above the 1961-90 climatology. This suggests that 1.26\u00b0C of the TXx anomaly was due to natural internal variability. By calculating the percentage of years with TXx temperature anomalies at or above 2.14\u00b0C in the reconstructions with ALL forcing and with the NAT forcing, the hot 2015 TXx would be roughly a Introduction. A prolonged heat wave hit Japan in early August 2015. Daily maximum surface air temperature (SAT) exceeded 35\u00b0C for eight consecutive days and the 8-day mean anomaly was greater than 4\u00b0C at several observation sites, causing over 10 000 people to suffer from heatstroke. This heat wave was particularly unusual because an ongoing extreme El Ni\u00f1o of 2015 was expected to lead to a cooler summer in Japan. A primary cause of this heat wave was an intraseasonal tropical disturbance (Fig. 21.1). A tropical cyclone (TC), TC1513, was generated in the western North Pacific (WNP) during the convectively active phase of the intraseasonal oscillation (ISO) in the western Pacific (Fig. 21.1c and Supplemental Fig.  S21.3c), followed by another TC (TC1514). Li and Zhou (2013) demonstrated that the two major components of the ISO, the 30-60 day Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO, Madden and Julian 1971) and the 10-20 day quasi-biweekly oscillation (QBWO, Chen and Sui 2010) can affect the genesis and intensity of TCs in the WNP during the summer. It appears that the TCs in this study likewise formed in association with the ISO. The diabatic heating associated with the TCrelated precipitation induced a Rossby wave train, which is characterized by cyclonic circulation and anticyclonic circulation anomalies in the WNP and East Asia, respectively (Figs. 21.1b,d). This pattern is similar to the so-called Pacific-Japan (PJ) teleconnection pattern (Nitta 1987;Wakabayashi and Kawamura 2004) in July and August, accompanying a meridional tripolar pattern in precipitation, vorticity, and temperature anomalies (Supplemental Fig. S21.1a). Several studies have also reported that TCs can generate the PJ pattern over the WNP (Kawamura and Ogasawara 2006;Yamada and Kawamura 2007). In early August 2015, the positive PJ pattern gave rise to the abnormally persistent hot and dry days over Japan. The El Ni\u00f1o conditions climatologically had a cooling impact on Japan in July-August (Supplemental Fig. S21.1a), yet the 2015 summer was still unexpectedly hot (Supplemental Fig. S21.1b). Anthropogenic warming can change the likelihood of specific extreme events, although the odds of an event occurring may vary from year to year depending on the regional sea surface temperature (SST) pattern (Christidis and Stott 2014). In this study, we investigate the possible influences of the intraseasonal variability, the 2015 strong El Ni\u00f1o, and anthropogenic warming on the Japanese heat wave in August 2015 using an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM). Methods. We performed four 100-member ensemble experiments using the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate, version 5 (MIROC5), AGCM with a horizontal resolution of 150 km . Each of the four experiments used different initial conditions during January-October 2015: 1) ALL: Experiments designed to simulate the current observed world, forced by the observed historical SST and sea ice (SIC) derived from the HadISST dataset  and historical anthropogenic and natural radiative forcing agents; 2) NAT1: Forced by natural forcing agents and historical SST and SIC The persistent Japanese heat wave that occurred in early August 2015 was mainly attributed to intraseasonal disturbances including tropical cyclones.

Bandpass (10-60 day) and low pass (60 day) filters are applied to daily anomaly fields in order to extract the intraseasonal (IS) and low frequency (LF) components of natural variability. The IS component is mainly associated with the PJ pattern that links to TCs, and the LF part is related to seasonal variability including the influence of the 2015 El Ni\u00f1o. The SAT anomaly in Japan was largely dominated by the IS component in mid-July to mid-August (Fig. 21.1a).

The observed intraseasonal PJ index exceeded 1 standard deviation (\u03c3) in the period of the heat wave in 2015 ( Fig. 21.1a). We mainly analyze the 10-day period from 31 July to 9 August 2015 to cover the extreme heat event (Fig. 21.1a). Results. The PJ pattern simulated in the ALL 100-member ensemble corresponds well with the observational pattern ( Supplemental Figs. S21.3.a,b). A few ensemble members in ALL had SAT anomalies over Japan equal to or higher than the observation (extreme warm members) and well represent the positive PJ patterns induced by northwestward-propagating TC-like disturbance as in the observations . Apart from the PJ pattern originating from TCs, an upper-tropospheric wave train also appears in the observation (Supplemental Fig. S21.3g). Ogasawara and  suggest that a combined effect of the PJ pattern and other teleconnection patterns propagating from the west may cause extraordinary summer weather. However, the extreme warm members in the ALL experiment do not exhibit a clear upper-level wave train (Supplemental Fig. S21.3h), suggesting that the PJ pattern played the key role in the occurrence of the 2015 extreme heat. The simulated SAT anomalies (T) are decomposed into IS (T IS ) and LF (T LF ) components for the 10-day period that includes the heat wave. The observed total and IS SAT anomalies are 1.7\u00b0C and 1.4\u00b0C averaged over Japan's land area (30\u00b0-42\u00b0N, 130\u00b0-145\u00b0E), respectively, indicating that the IS component mostly explains the total SAT anomaly (Fig. 21.2a). The relative contributions of anthropogenic forcing and El Ni\u00f1o to the 2015 extreme heat wave are evaluated. The occurrence probability of an extreme warm event that exceeds or is equal to the observed SAT anomaly is estimated using the probability density function (PDFs) based on the assumption of a Gaussian distribution in each run. The best estimates (50th percentile) and uncertainties (the 5%-95% range) of the probabilities are estimated through random resampling. The best estimate in occurrence probability (the 5%-95% uncertainty range) of the 2015 extreme event is 2.8% (1.2%-4.7%) for ALL, 1.8% (0.7%-3.4%) for NAT1, 1.6% (0.6%-2.8%) for NAT2, and 4.5% (2.2%-7.0%) for ALLnoENSO (Fig. 21.2c). The results suggest that the anthropogenic warming contributed to increase the probability of the 2015 heat wave by 1.5 to 1.7 times (5%-95% range: 0.6-5.0), while the El Ni\u00f1o condition acted to counteract the anthropogenic warming effect and decrease the probability by 0.6 times (5%-95% range: 0.2-1.5). We also investigate why the low-frequency SAT in Japan during the 2015 heat wave unexpectedly exhibits positive anomalies (Fig. 21.1a) in spite of the strong El Ni\u00f1o year. The influences of anthropogenic forcing and El Ni\u00f1o on T LF can be estimated from the difference between ALL and NAT (T GW1 and T GW2 ), and ALL and ALLnoENSO (T ENSO ), respectively (Fig. 21.2b). The ensemble mean of T LF in ALL is approximately consistent with that in observation (Figs. 21.2a,d). The ensemble mean with 1 \u03c3 is 0.60\u00b0C \u00b1 0.42\u00b0C for T GW1 , 0.44\u00b0C \u00b1 0.46\u00b0C for T GW2 , and \u22120.24\u00b0C \u00b1 0.44\u00b0C for T ENSO. In observation, the SAT anomaly in Japan is \u22120.19\u00b0C \u00b1 0.31\u00b0C for the warm phase of the ENSO, when Ni\u00f1o-3.4 SST anomaly is greater than 0.7 \u03c3 in July-August for 1958-2014. These results indicate that the 2015 El Ni\u00f1o (T ENSO ) has a cooling impact on temperatures in Japan comparable to that of the climatology for other El Ni\u00f1o years and suggest that the impact of anthropogenic warming overcomes the cooling effect by the El Ni\u00f1o. However, an individual atmospheric response to SST variability in the tropics has large variation for the observation and the simulation. The best estimate (the 5%-95% range) of the probability exceeding the observed anomaly (0.20\u00b0C) for T LF by similar resampling is 48.6% (43.0%-54.7%) for ALL, 8.3% (5.3%-12.2%) for NAT1, 18.3% (13.7%-22.8%) for NAT2, and 69.5% (64.7%-74.8%) for ALL-noENSO ( Fig. 21.2d). This result also suggests that anthropogenic forcing caused a significant increase in the probability of a seasonally warm 2015 summer in Japan, while the El Ni\u00f1o decreased it. As LF components are better captured by the ALL ensemble, we focused on the anthropogenic and El Ni\u00f1o contributions to T LF over a wider region. In observations, positive T LF anomalies over Japan are accompanied by anticyclonic circulation anomalies, which may be part of a wave train emanating from the subtropical WNP through the North Pacific to the west coast of North America that appears to be a seasonally generated positive PJ pattern (Fig. 21.2e). The changes in the atmospheric circulation owing to anthropogenic warming and El Ni\u00f1o, represented by T GW2 and T ENSO, show a different structure (Figs.  21.2g,h). The change in atmospheric temperature as a result of anthropogenic global warming simulated by climate models shows strong warming over the polar region in the lower-to mid-troposphere (e.g., Simpson et al. 2014). This change indicates that the midlatitude S110 DECEMBER 2016 | Fig. 21.2. (a "}, {"section_title": "S111", "text": "DECEMBER 2016 AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY | circulation undergoes a poleward shift and thus the equator-to-pole temperature gradient decreases. The change in circulation patterns due to the anthropogenic effect (T GW2 ) likewise represents the midlatitude anticyclones with SAT and SST warming (Fig. 21.2g). On the other hand, the El Ni\u00f1o-induced teleconnection pattern in 2015 formed a wave train propagating from the tropical western Pacific northward and acts to decrease the seasonal SAT accompanied by the anomalous cyclonic circulation over Japan that links to a suppressed northward expansion of the climatological North Pacific high (Fig. 21.2h). The seasonal PJ pattern in summer tends to have negative correlations with El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the preceding boreal winter and with Indian Ocean temperature in the concurrent summer (Kubota et al. 2015). The 2015 El Ni\u00f1o-induced pattern (Fig. 21.2h) seems to be out of phase with the well-known PJ pattern (Wakabayashi and Kawamura 2004). ENSO modifies the background state of tropical-subtropical ISO and thus significantly affects the degree of ISO modulation on TC formation in the WNP (Li et al. 2012). The El Ni\u00f1o in the summer 2015 provides the favorable background condition for the growth of tropical disturbances, including strengthened vorticity and monsoon trough within 5\u00b0-20\u00b0N ( Fig. 21.2h). We examined a possible influence of El Ni\u00f1o on the intraseasonal PJ teleconnection pattern and associated SAT in Japan for July-August 2015 (Supplemental Fig. S21.4). The result indicates that the extreme rainfall accompanied by intraseasonal variability is more enhanced east of the Philippines, which may in turn cause more warming in Japan through the PJ teleconnection due to extreme El Ni\u00f1o in 2015 (see online Supplemental Material). This work notes that an understanding of the interaction between tropical SST and the intraseasonal teleconnection is of importance for weather and climate prediction for East Asia. A follow-up study using atmosphere-ocean coupled GCMs is required to investigate any role of air-sea interaction in extraordinary weather and climate in Japan. Conclusions. The persistent Japanese heat wave that occurred in early August of 2015 was mainly attributed to intraseasonal disturbances, including TCs. Yet, it is found that the anthropogenic warming increased the probability of occurrence of the event by 1.5 to 1.7 times. The contribution of human-induced warming to the 2015 heat wave would have been more pronounced if there had not been a concurrent extreme El Ni\u00f1o event because El Ni\u00f1o has a cooling effect in Japan.  (Figs. 22.1a,b). The combination of heat and drought contributed to fires across much of the country, which were associated with fatalities and were likely the worst since 1997 (Huijnen et al. 2016). The fires had broader health impacts through increased prevalence of respiratory problems (Koplitz et al. 2016)."}, {"section_title": "S113", "text": "El Ni\u00f1o conditions in the central Pacific are strongly linked with seasonal precipitation deficits south of the equator in the dry season (Hendon 2003;Fig. 22.1c) and, to a lesser extent, warmer land temperatures (Harger 1995;Fig. 22.1d). Previous strong El Ni\u00f1o events, such as 1997, were associated with severe drought conditions in Indonesia. Anthropogenic influences may also have played a role in this event. The relative influences of El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and human-induced climate change are investigated here. Data and methods. To assess this current extreme event in the long-term context of a changing climate, it is desirable to have high-quality longterm observational time series. It is also preferable to have gridded observations, when comparing with climate model output, at a moderate resolution, especially over Indonesia where larger grid boxes contain both land and ocean. Unfortunately, in many regions of the developing world such data do not exist. The use of temperature and precipitation data from a range of observation-based datasets were investigated, and ERA-Interim (1979 was selected for use in this analysis. Other longer-running reanalyses and analyses, such as ERA-20C (Poli et al. 2016) and CRU-TS3.23 (Harris et al. 2014), were found to include inhomogeneities prior to the satellite era (1979 onwards). A long, relatively homogenous, precipitation series was obtained from the GPCC 1\u00b0 V7 analysis  extended by the V5 monitoring analysis (Schneider et al. 2015). Temperature and precipitation data were regridded onto a regular 2\u00b0 grid and averaged over land boxes within the region 0\u00b0-11\u00b0S, 95\u00b0-141\u00b0E for July-October (time series shown in Supplemental Fig. S22.1). There is agreement in temperature trends between ERA-Interim and limited observational data from the public Global Historical Climatology Network-Monthly database (Lawrimore et al. 2011) available since 1979 (Supplemental Fig. S22.2). The trends and connection to El Ni\u00f1o were also investigated in observational data. It was impossible to find a temperature series longer than the ERA-Interim series, as the station density is low, variability is small, and coastal effects make interpolation to the interiors of large islands doubtful. For further details on our observational analysis, see the online Supplemental Material. The Ni\u00f1o-3.4 index was calculated from HadISST  for July-December. Values of the Ni\u00f1o-3.4 index more than +0.83\u00b0C (1\u03c3) above zero in the observations were deemed to be El Ni\u00f1o seasons. Applying this threshold to the climate models results in selecting 10% of the seasons due to a tendency toward lower Ni\u00f1o-3.4 variability in most models. Model data were extracted from the CMIP5 archive (Taylor et al. 2012) and evaluated for their performance in capturing observed temperature and precipitation variability. The model data processing followed the same regridding and subsequent masking as the reanalysis (the raw resolution of most "}, {"section_title": "S114", "text": "DECEMBER 2016 | models used here is finer than 2\u00b0). July-October temperature and precipitation averages over Indonesia and July-December Ni\u00f1o-3.4 index values were extracted. Simulations from the \"historical\" experiment (including natural and anthropogenic forcings for 1861-2005) were compared with observation-based data over the common 1979-2005 period. To account for the shorter period over which the evaluation takes place, additional evaluation steps were included that test model ability to capture Indonesian climate variability and ENSO relationships (described in the Supplemental Material). Models with at least three historical simulations (listed in Supplemental Table  S22.1) were tested for similarity to observational data. The ten models that passed the evaluation were further analyzed. Equivalent Indonesian temperature and precipitation averages and Ni\u00f1o-3.4 index values were calculated from the historicalNat (natural forcings only for 1861-2005) and RCP8.5 (projected climate under a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario for 2006-30) simulations. The historical and equivalent RCP8.5 simulations were joined to form simulations included in an allforcings ensemble , which were compared with a natural-forcings ensemble (1861-2005) using the historicalNat runs. These ensembles were then used to investigate the change in likelihood of extreme heat (above +0.7\u00b0C anomaly) and drought (below 60% of average precipitation) in Indonesia due to anthropogenic climate change and El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation. In addition, we estimated the change in magnitude of hot and dry July-October periods in Indonesia due to climate change and the El Ni\u00f1o conditions.

This result is based on the models that passed our evaluation tests and adequately capture Indonesian climate variability and ENSO relationships. The significant increase in frequency of low rainfall totals in the all-forcings ensemble compared with the natural-forcings ensemble is consistent with the simulated reduction in July-October mean precipitation. These results contrast previous attribution analyses of precipitation deficits in other parts of the world, such as Australia (King et al. 2014), Brazil (Otto et al. 2015), and Texas (Rupp et al. 2015) that found limited evidence of a strong anthropogenic influence. The observational precipitation time series (for 1901-2014) shows a downward trend in low extremes, albeit a nonsignificant trend (Fig. 22.2a), and no trend in mean July-October precipitation. The dry tail of the observations and the El Ni\u00f1o tail in the models agree well (Fig. 22.2a). 2) Attribution to anthropogenic influences: high temperature extremes High temperatures like those observed in 2015 do not occur in our natural-forcings ensemble (as indicated by all green crosses being below the 2015 mark in Fig. 22.2c), but do exist in our all-forcings ensemble. Therefore, in our model-based analysis, the high temperatures are entirely attributable to anthropogenic influence. The probability is also vanishingly small in the observations (Fig. 22.2c), even though we can only go back to 1979, which misses about 1/3 of the warming signal. We also did not separate out El Ni\u00f1o years in the observations due to the small num- Fig. 22.2. (a) "}, {"section_title": "S116", "text": "DECEMBER 2016 | ber of samples. The warming trend in ERA-Interim can also be seen in longer observational time series, such as Jakarta (Siswanto et al. 2015). 3) Attribution to El Ni\u00f1o: low rainfall extremes Given the strong ENSO relationship with Indonesian dry-season precipitation (Fig. 22.1c) and the strong El Ni\u00f1o of 2015-16, it is expected that the El Ni\u00f1o also influenced the likelihood of a rainfall deficit occurring. Comparing precipitation deficits in the all-forcings ensemble between El Ni\u00f1o seasons with neutral and La Ni\u00f1a seasons, we found at least a 300% increase (best-estimate: 500% increase) in likelihood of having dry July-October periods in El Ni\u00f1o years. An analysis of the detrended long observed rainfall series shows that the probability of a dry season like July-October 2015 increases by at least a factor 20 over neutral years (Fig. 22.2b). The models have a somewhat broader distribution toward dry seasons than the observations. 4) Attribution to El Ni\u00f1o: high temperature extremes In comparison, ENSO has a weaker (but statistically significant relationship) with Indonesian land temperatures. In the models, the likelihood of hot July-October periods in Indonesia is raised by at least 22% (best estimate: 51%) in El Ni\u00f1o seasons relative to neutral and La Ni\u00f1a events combined (Fig. 22.2d). The reanalysis shows a stronger effect, with the probability increased by at least 300% compared to a neutral year like 2005 (after detrending). This is again caused by the broader modeled distribution than the observed one ( Fig. 22.2d). C onc l us ions . Indonesia endured severe heat and drought during the dry season of 2015. By investigating the July-October high temperatures and low rainfall totals in ensembles of coupled climate models with and without anthropogenic forcings, an attribution of these extreme conditions to humaninduced climate change and the concurrent El Ni\u00f1o was conducted. The model-based and observational analyses show that El Ni\u00f1o conditions strongly increased the probability of a drier-than-normal dry season, and that the background warming trend due to anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of high temperatures. El Ni\u00f1o also caused somewhat higher land temperatures. The models also show a trend toward less rain and more extreme dry events, which is smaller than can be significantly detected in the observations to now. Dry-season precipitation variability in Indonesia is strongly related to ENSO, while a very clear warm-ing trend is detectable there. Our results are in line with time of emergence studies in that regard (e.g. Mahlstein et al. 2011), which find an earlier warming signal in tropical regions such as Indonesia due to a high signal-to-noise ratio. A difficulty with performing this study was the lack of high-quality long-running observational climate data representative of our study area. The use of ERA-Interim reanalyses to evaluate the models and provide thresholds for the CMIP5-based analysis is not ideal. This difficulty is a problem across much of the developing world, where extreme weather and climate events also tend to have the strongest impacts. Further analysis on how to best conduct attribution studies where observations are sparse or have suspected inhomogeneities is required. Introduction. Australia experienced its warmest October on record in 2015 (Australian Bureau of Meteorology 2015). This was primarily the result of an early season heat wave in the beginning of the month, concentrated over southern Australia (SAUS; Fig. 23.1a). The monthly anomaly for maximum temperature over SAUS (5.16\u00b0C; Fig. 23.1b) was the largest ever recorded for the region for any month of the year. This unseasonably warm weather over SAUS led to an early start to the bushfire season and caused significant crop losses across one of Australia's most important agricultural regions, the Murray-Darling basin."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS. This research was", "text": "The October heat coincided with one of the strongest El Ni\u00f1o events on record. While warm and dry conditions over parts of Australia are typical of an El Ni\u00f1o event, the observed record-breaking temperatures may have been exacerbated by climate change. This study uses very large ensembles of atmosphereonly regional climate model simulations to assess the relative roles of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and anthropogenic climate change in the October 2015 extreme heat across SAUS. Data and methods. Our study made use of the weather@home Australia-New Zealand project  to generate very large ensembles of regiona l climate model simu lations over Australia. This setup uses the atmosphere-only model, HadAM3P, to drive a nested regional model (HadRM3P; 0.44\u00b0 resolution). For details of the modeling setup, see ; only a brief description is provided here for context. First, the model was run under two distinct climate scenarios: observed (all forcings, ALL) and counterfactual (natural forcings only, NAT) realizations of the year 2015. For the ALL simulations, the model was driven by observed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and sea ice from the Met Office Operational Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Ice Analysis dataset (OSTIA; , as well as present-day atmospheric composition (well-mixed greenhouse gases, ozone, and aerosols). Very large ensembles were generated by running the model with perturbed initial conditions. For the NAT simulations, the model was driven by preindustrial (1850) atmospheric composition, while the SSTs were modified to remove different estimates of the warming attributable to anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Estimates of the SST changes due to human influence were separately calculated using eight CMIP5 models (Taylor et al. 2012; see online Supplemental Material). Therefore, eight alternative realizations of the NAT climate were created. By adjusting observed SSTs to remove the anthropogenic signal, the main modes of natural variability represented in the ALL SSTs (e.g., the phase of ENSO) are maintained in the NAT climate realizations. Therefore, any change of likelihood of heat events between the ALL and NAT scenarios can be directly attributed to anthropogenic forcing. To assess the influence of ENSO on the occurrence of SAUS temperature records, additional simulations were generated by driving the weather@home model with composite SST patterns representative of each of the three phases of ENSO: El Ni\u00f1o, Neutral, and La Ni\u00f1a (see online supplemental material for details). Each of these three phases was modeled under both ALL and NAT climate realizations (as per the 2015 runs listed above). Previous work has shown that the weather@home model is able to correctly represent ENSO teleconnections over Australia . We used all of the model simulations that "}, {"section_title": "S119", "text": "DECEMBER 2016 AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY | were available at the time of this writing: at least 2700 members for each of the ALL scenarios (i.e., 2015 ALL, El Ni\u00f1o ALL, Neutral ALL, and La Ni\u00f1a ALL) and at least 650 members for each of the corresponding eight NAT realizations. For brevity, this study focuses on SAUS because this region experienced exceptional October heat (Fig. 23.1a). A subset of SAUS, the Murray-Darling basin (MDB), is also examined as it is located in the east where the ENSO relationship w it h temperature is typically stronger (e.g., . Homogeneous temperature records for both regions were provided by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (Figs.  23.1b,c), calculated from the Australian Cl i mate Obser vat ions Reference Network-Surface Air Temperature (ACORN-SAT) dataset (Trewin 2013). For both SAUS and the MDB, areaweighted October average maximum temperatures were calculated for each of the ALL and NAT model simulations. As per , we correct for model bias (0.13\u00b0C for SAUS and 0.68\u00b0C for MDB) by adjusting the mean of the NAT distribution to equal that of the early ACORN-SAT observations (1910-39); this bias adjustment is then applied to the ALL distribution. I n l i n e w i t h o t h e r c o m m o n approaches, we define an anomaly t hreshold based on t he prev ious observed record (+3.68\u00b0C for SAUS and +4.15\u00b0C for the MDB, both set in 2014; see Figs. 23.1b,c). To quantify the change in risk of extreme heat due to different forcing scenarios, we calculate the fraction of attributable risk (FAR; Allen 2003), defined as FAR = 1 \u2212 (P 1 / P 2 ), where P 1 and P 2 represent the probabilities of exceeding the October temperature threshold in two different scenarios. In the first instance, we estimate the anthropogenic influence by setting P 1 to be the probability of exceeding the October temperature threshold in the 2015 NAT scenarios, while P 2 is the equivalent for the 2015 ALL scenario. Here, we aggregate the eight NAT realizations in order to calculate a best estimate of FAR. This process is repeated for the El Ni\u00f1o NAT and El Ni\u00f1o ALL scenarios. Next, to estimate the influence of El Ni\u00f1o conditions on the change in risk of extreme heat, we calculate FAR using P 1 from the La Ni\u00f1a ALL simulations and P 2 from the El Ni\u00f1o ALL simulations; this is also repeated for Neutral ALL (P 1 ) and El Ni\u00f1o ALL (P 2 ). Therefore, we are able to quantify the change in risk due to both anthropogenic forcing and the phase of ENSO. An assessment of FAR uncertainty was estimated by a bootstrap procedure (10 000 times with replacement) and the 10th percentile FAR value is used to make conservative estimates of changes in Results. Figure 23.2a shows the model-derived distributions of SAUS October average maximum temperature for the various forcing scenarios. There is close agreement between the distributions for the 2015 ALL and El Ni\u00f1o ALL scenarios, as well as between the 2015 NAT and El Ni\u00f1o NAT scenarios, suggesting that the El Ni\u00f1o composite SSTs are a suitable analogue for the 2015 observed conditions. Even though the SSTs for the 2015 El Ni\u00f1o were extreme, the model results in Fig. 23.2a indicate that the associated temperature anomalies in Australia were consistent with a typical El Ni\u00f1o event. The ALL scenarios are clearly warmer than the NAT scenarios. The La Ni\u00f1a ALL distribution is notably cooler than both Neutral ALL and El Ni\u00f1o ALL, although the warm tails of the distributions are seen to converge. Figure 23.2a suggests that even under La Ni\u00f1a conditions, extreme SAUS and MDB temperatures as warm as in El Ni\u00f1o ALL and Neutral ALL can be achieved. The corresponding FAR estimates for exceeding the previous SAUS temperature record are shown in Fig. 23.2b. When comparing the ALL scenarios against the NAT scenarios (first two columns of Fig.  23.2b), the 10th percentile FAR estimates are around "}, {"section_title": "S121", "text": "DECEMBER 2016 AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY | 0.76. Therefore, it is very likely (with 90% confidence) that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of breaking the previous SAUS temperature record by at least 400%. Meanwhile, FAR estimates comparing El Ni\u00f1o ALL against La Ni\u00f1a ALL (third column) and Neutral ALL (fourth column) result in the 10th percentiles being below zero. Therefore, we cannot conclude (with 90% confidence) that El Ni\u00f1o conditions increased the likelihood of setting a new SAUS temperature record. The results for the MDB (Figs. 23.2c,d) are similar to SAUS. When comparing the ALL and NAT scenarios for the MDB, the 10th percentile FAR values were of the order of 0.67, that is a 300% increase in likelihood due to anthropogenic climate change. Meanwhile, the ENSO response is clearer over the MDB than for all of SAUS: FAR estimates when comparing El Ni\u00f1o ALL and La Ni\u00f1a ALL indicate it is very likely that El Ni\u00f1o conditions increased the likelihood of breaking the previous MDB record by 4% when compared to La Ni\u00f1a conditions. Conclusions. This study demonstrates a novel approach for separating the role of ENSO and anthropogenic climate change within the context of an event attribution study. Using regional climate model simulations from the weather@home modeling setup, we identify that anthropogenic climate change had a substantial influence on southern Australia's extreme heat in October 2015. El Ni\u00f1o also contributed to the heat, but its relative influence was much weaker. These conclusions, of course, rely heavily on our assumption that our model is able to correctly represent extreme temperatures in southern Australia during El Ni\u00f1o events. However, this cannot be thoroughly tested due to a lack of observational samples. By generating an extremely large number of regional climate model simulations under different forcing scenarios, weather@home is shown to be a powerful tool for understanding the drivers of recent Australian temperature extremes."}, {"section_title": "S122", "text": "Using a seasonal forecasting framework for attribution, we find that half of the record heat anomaly across Australia in October 2015 can be attributed to increasing CO 2 , with much of the rest due to internal atmospheric variability.   assessed the level of influence from anthropogenic climate change on the October 2015 heat across southern Australia.

A FAR of 0.76 means that October 2015 was at least four times more likely to exceed the previous record, set in 2014, of 29.68\u00b0C in the current world than in the natural world. Here, extending the method of Hope et al. (2015), we use a fully coupled seasonal forecast modeling system to attribute the level of influence of both the last 55 years of increasing CO 2 and natural (internal) variability on this event. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology's seasonal forecast model POAMA-2.4 (Cottrill et al. 2013;Hudson et al. 2013) was used. Note that the use of a coupled seasonal forecast system in this way is unique and has certain limitations and strengths compared to other methods. For instance, the initial-value nature of the framework allows little time for the growth of model-driven biases, while allowing the full coupled response of the ocean-atmosphere-land system. Currently, only changes in CO 2 are considered and not other anthropogenic factors such as land-use change or aerosols. For full details of the method used here, refer to Wang et al. (2016). For each of 24 September, 27 September, and 1 October 2015, an 11-member ensemble forecast of October 2015 under current CO 2 levels (400 ppm) was initialized with observed atmosphere, ocean, and land conditions, forming a 33-member ensemble. A corresponding ensemble forecast was also initialized on the same dates, but with CO 2 set to the 1960 level of 315 ppm and with anomalies-corresponding to the signature of change due to the last 55 years of rising CO 2 -removed from the ocean, soil, and atmosphere to create a \"low CO 2 \" forecast. For the threedimensional ocean, the signature of change due to rising CO 2 levels was the difference between the ocean state in the final years of long integrations with fixed CO 2 at 400 or 315 ppm. To calculate the signature of change in the atmosphere or land, differences were made between two sets of forecasts for October 2015 using either current initial conditions or the current initial conditions with 315 ppm and the ocean state after subtracting the difference as calculated above. Two forecast climatologies, one for the current climate and one for the low CO 2 climate, were produced with an ensemble of 11 members initialized on 1 October for each year from 2000-14. Although short, this 15year period includes a range of interannual variability due to the different states of ENSO. The climatology "}, {"section_title": "S124", "text": "DECEMBER 2016 | has 165 members (11 forecasts for each October, 15 in total). The time series of the ensemble mean forecasts and the forecast spread of the two experiments are shown in Fig. 24.1b. The probability distribution functions (PDFs) are shown in Fig. 24.2b. The record heat across Australia in October 2015 was well predicted under current CO 2 levels; the 2015 ensemble mean was warmer than any year in the 2000-14 climatology (Fig. 24.1b, red line). Although the ensemble mean anomaly was less than observed, one forecast ensemble member was warmer than observed ( Fig. 24.2a). The forecast for October 2015 under the current climate was 2.0\u00b0C warmer than the low CO 2 climatology mean (Fig. 24.2a, red dot compared to blue line) The ensemble mean of the October 2015 forecast in the low CO 2 climate was the warmest ensemble mean against the low CO 2 climatology (Fig.  24.1b, blue line). Thus even under low CO 2 conditions, forecasts driven by the observed state of the internal atmospheric variability were the warmest on record. An obvious measure of the contribution from increasing CO 2 is simply the difference between the two means of the current and low CO 2 forecast climatologies, which is 1.0\u00b0C and statistically significant (p < 0.01) ( Fig. 24.2, dashed lines). This aligns with the observed change of 1.1\u00b0C from around 1960 (1953-67) to recent years , see Fig. 24.1c. To calculate an estimate of the FAR, the previous record was taken as the warmest ensemble mean forecast in the climatology under current CO 2 levels, with a value of 31.4\u00b0C. Across the 33-member forecast ensemble of 2015, five members exceeded this threshold in the low CO 2 climate, while 17 exceeded it in the current climate, leading to a FAR value of 0.71. Alternatively, if the previous record was taken from observations (32.1\u00b0C, set in 2014), none of the ensemble members of the 2015 forecast in a low CO 2 climate exceeded this threshold, while six ensemble members exceeded it in the current climate, thus the FAR would be 1.0. Assessing the influence from the climatic and synoptic conditions. In order to further explore the importance of the atmospheric state (e.g., MJO, the location of the subtropical ridge, SAM) as compared to the antecedent land conditions or the oceanic state (e.g., El Ni\u00f1o, IOD) for promoting the record warmth, further forecast experiments were done, removing the influence from either the land, ocean, or atmosphere initial conditions, following Arblaster et al. (2014) and Wang et al. (2016). The results (outlined in more detail in the online supplemental material) indicate that the overwhelming driver of the heat was the atmospheric state from the atmospheric initial conditions, as opposed to the ocean or land state. This suggests that the direct impact on warming from the strong El Ni\u00f1o and IOD was small, and the major impact was from intraseasonal drivers such as MJO activity in the tropical Indian Ocean, the negative SAM, and Tasman Sea blocking. Conclusions. Using a seasonal forecast framework, the record heat of October 2015 across Australia was attributed to the last 55 years of CO 2 induced warming and other factors. The warming from CO 2 contributed roughly 1.0\u00b0C to the extreme heat forecast across Australia in October 2015, while a combination of Tasman Sea blocking, negative SAM, MJO, and a high positioned over the southeast of the country, on Fig. 24.2. (a) "}, {"section_title": "S125", "text": "DECEMBER 2016 AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY | the background state of a strong El Ni\u00f1o and a positive IOD, all contributed to the remaining 1.0\u00b0C of the 2.0\u00b0C forecast anomaly against a 1960, low CO 2 climatology. The FAR estimate for October 2015 Aus-Tmax being warmer than the previous record using this framework was 0.71, similar to the 0.76 that  showed for southern Australia. The pattern of anomalously low pressure to the south of Australia and a high over the southeast of the continent appears to be a consistent feature of the extreme heat across southern Australia during the last three springs of 2013 (Arblaster et al. 2014), 2014 Gallant and Lewis 2016), and 2015.

This had major impacts across the state, affecting agriculture and hydroelectric power generation and preconditioning the landscape for major bushfires the following summer (Hobday et al. 2016). Rainfall in Tasmania is normally high throughout the year, with variations in Austral spring associated with mean sea level pressure (MSLP) and circulation variations due to El Ni\u00f1o, the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD), and the southern annular mode (SAM; Hill et al. 2009). Spring rainfall is declining and projected to decrease further in Tasmania  This record low rainfall was associated with extreme high MSLP over much of southeast Australia (Fig. 25.1b) and record high October mean maximum temperature over southern Australia . The wave train pattern of MSLP anomalies in October (Fig. 25.1b) from southern Australia across the South Pacific is typical of the Pacific South American (PSA) pattern (Mo and Higgins 1998). El Ni\u00f1o conditions, such as in late 2015, are associated with a shift in tropical Pacific rainfall and in waveguides in the extratropical Pacific that influence the PSA pattern (Karoly 1989) and rainfall in Tasmania."}, {"section_title": "S127", "text": "We have investigated the roles of anthropogenic climate change, the 2015/16 El Ni\u00f1o, and internal atmospheric variability on this record low October rainfall using observational data, regional climate simu lations driven by specif ied sea surface temperatures (SSTs) from the weather@home Australia and New Zealand (w@h ANZ) project Massey et al. 2015), and coupled climate model simulations from the Coupled  Data and Methods. Monthly area-average rainfall data for Tasmania were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. The October rainfall for 1900-2015 was obtained from high-resolution gridded data from the Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP; . The dataset uses all available monthly rainfall station data, with sparser station coverage early in the period. Ver y large ensembles of regiona l climate simulations of rainfall over Tasmania were used from the w@h ANZ project. This uses the atmosphereonly model, HadAM3P, to drive a nested regional model (HadRM3P; 0.44\u00b0 resolution). For details of the modeling setup, see . First, the model was run under two climate scenarios for 2015: observed (all forcings; ALL) and counterfactual (natural forcings only; NAT) realizations. For the ALL simulations, the model used observed SSTs and sea ice from the Operational Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA; , as well as present-day atmospheric composition (long-lived greenhouse gases, ozone, and aerosols). Very large ensembles were generated by running the model with perturbed atmospheric initial conditions. For the NAT simulations, the model was driven by preindustrial atmospheric composition and SSTs modified to remove different estimates of the warming attributable to anthropogenic forcing. Estimates of the SST changes due to anthropogenic forcing were separately calculated using eight CMIP5 models (Taylor et al. 2012; see online Supplemental Material), giving eight realizations of possible NAT SSTs. The main modes of natural variability represented in the ALL SSTs (e.g., the phase of El Ni\u00f1o) are maintained in the NAT SSTs. Therefore, any change in likelihood of low Tasmanian rainfall between these ALL and NAT scenarios can be directly attributed to anthropogenic forcing . To assess the influence of El Ni\u00f1o on Tasmanian rainfall, additional simulations were generated by driving the w@h ANZ model with composite SST patterns representative of El Ni\u00f1o, Neutral, and La Ni\u00f1a phases (see supplemental material). Each of these three phases was modeled under both ALL and NAT climate scenarios (as for the 2015 runs). Previous analysis has shown that the w@h ANZ model is able to represent El Ni\u00f1o teleconnections over Australia . We used all the model simulations that were available; more than 2700 members for each of the ALL scenarios (2015 ALL, El Ni\u00f1o ALL, Neutral ALL, and La Ni\u00f1a ALL) and more than 650 members for each of the corresponding eight NAT realizations (at least 5200 members for each NAT scenario). Following , we corrected any model rainfall bias by scaling the Tasmanian October rainfall from the ALL simulations so that the mean of the distribution is equal to that of the recent AWAP observations . This bias adjustment is then applied to the NAT distribution. To examine possible changes in the likelihood of extreme low October rainfall, we define a threshold based on the previous observed record (56 mm in 1965; see Fig. 25.1a) rather than the 2015 record, to reduce selection bias. The 1914 low rainfall value was not used because of the smaller number of rainfall stations available then, which limits the reliability of the Tasmanian rainfall estimate given the varied topography across the state. The current rainfall station network across Tasmania has been relatively stable since the mid-1950s. To quantify the change in likelihood of extreme low rainfall due to different forcing scenarios, we calculate the fraction of attributable risk (FAR; Allen 2003), defined as FAR = 1 \u2212 (P 1 / P 2 ). We estimate the anthropogenic (El Ni\u00f1o) influence by setting P 1 to be the probability of rainfall lower than the October threshold in the NAT (La Ni\u00f1a and Neutral) simulations, while P 2 is the equivalent for the ALL (El Ni\u00f1o) simulations. Hence, we are able to quantify the change in likelihood due to either anthropogenic forcing or El Ni\u00f1o. FAR uncertainty was estimated by bootstrap resampling groups of 1000 simulations from each of the ensembles (10 000 times with replacement) and the 10th percentile FAR value is used to provide conservative estimates of changes in likelihood associated with the different forcing. Coupled climate model data were extracted from the CMIP5 archive and evaluated for their performance in capturing observed variability of Tasmanian rainfall. The model data were regridded onto a 2\u00b0 grid and October rainfall over Tasmania and July-December Ni\u00f1o-3.4 SST values were extracted. Simulations from the \"historical\" experiment (including natural and anthropogenic forcings for 1861-2005) were compared with observations over 1951-2005. Models with at least three historical simulations were tested for similarity to observational data following King et al. (2016). The twelve models S129 DECEMBER 2016 AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY | that passed this evaluation are listed in supplemental material. Given the coarse model resolution and poor representation of topography in western Tasmania, the simulated rainfall anomalies were assessed as percentage anomalies from the 1961-90 historical average, removing any rainfall bias. October rainfall and Ni\u00f1o-3.4 data were extracted from the historicalNat (natural forcings only for 1861-2005) simulations and RCP8.5 (projected climate under a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario for 2006-35) simulations. The historical and matching RCP8.5 simulations were combined to provide an ALL forcing ensemble for 1995-2035 (40 years centered on 2015), which was compared with the NAT ensemble (1861-2005) using the historicalNat runs. These ensembles were then used to investigate the change in likelihood of low rainfall due to anthropogenic climate change. Results. The observed October rainfall data show a significant but small correlation with El Ni\u00f1o and a small, nonsignificant drying trend. The linear regression estimate of the October 2015 rainfall anomaly associated with the Ni\u00f1o-3.4 SST value is \u221226 \u00b1 10 mm. Assessment of the probability distributions of October rainfall from the w@h ANZ simulations (Fig.  25.2a) shows good agreement with observations and that the ALL ensembles are significantly drier than the NAT ensembles for both the 2015 and composite El Ni\u00f1o scenarios. The drying is about 8 mm for the median and about 5 mm for the 5th percentile. A mean drying of about 6% is also found in the CMIP5 simulations ( Fig. 25.2a). The October rainfall distribution from the w@h ANZ El Ni\u00f1o ALL ensemble is also drier than the combined Neutral/La Ni\u00f1a ensemble (Fig. 25.2a), with a drying of about 5 mm for the 5th percentile. This is much smaller than the observational-estimated anomaly for the 2015 El Ni\u00f1o. This El Ni\u00f1o analysis was not undertaken for the CMIP5 simulations due to the smaller number of El Ni\u00f1o years available. Next, the change in likelihood of record low rainfall below the 1965 threshold is assessed for the different scenarios, using the FAR results shown in Fig. 25.2b. For the w@h ANZ simulations, anthropogenic forcing very likely increases the likelihood of low rainfall by at least 39% (median increase 75%) for the 2015 scenario and by at least 18% (median increase 59%) for the composite El Ni\u00f1o scenario. For the CMIP5 simulations, the FAR results are less certain, with anthropogenic forcing possibly decreasing the likelihood by 12% or increasing it by up to 82%, with a median increase of 25%. Using the w@h ANZ simulations again, El Ni\u00f1o very likely increases the risk of low October rainfall by at least 18% (median increase 59%). There are circulation differences between the w@h ANZ ALL and NAT simulations that are consistent with the response to anthropogenic forcing, including higher MSLP in middle latitudes and a significantly more positive SAM index in the ALL scenario, as found also in the CMIP5 simulations (Gillett et al. 2013). Conclusions. Tasmania experienced its driest October on record in 2015. Anthropogenic climate change and the strong El Ni\u00f1o in 2015 very likely increased the chances of breaking the previous record low rainfall in 1965. In terms of contributions to the magnitude of this rainfall deficit, internal atmospheric variability as indicated by the PSA MSLP pattern (Fig. 25.1b "}, {"section_title": "S132", "text": "DECEMBER 2016 | trend in the experiments without (with) anthropogenic forcing. We compute FAR using P 0 from a 1990 control experiment of FLOR and P 1 from a 2 \u00d7 CO 2 experiment with the same model (van der Wiel et al. 2016). We also compute P 0 (P 1 ) from the two experiments of HiFLOR with radiative forcing representative of 1940 (2015; 1940 is also a strong El Ni\u00f1o year). Natural Variability. The extremely high 2015 WNP ACE is mostly due to a large number of category 4 and 5 (C45; wind speed exceeding 58.1 m s \u22121 ) TCs (Fig. 26.1a). There were 13 C45 TCs in the WNP during 2015, more than twice the climatological value of 6.3. The 2015 C45 proportion, defined by the number of C45 TCs divided by the basin-total TCs, is 0.48 while the climatology  is 0.25. The 2015 basin-total TC frequency (27) is slightly higher than climatology (25). The ENSO-WNP ACE association is supported by the high Ni\u00f1o-3.4 index in 2015, similar to those in 1997 (Figs. 26.1b,c). The SST warming in 2015 extends westward to 160\u00b0E, and this provides favorable conditions for TC intensification because WNP TC intensification is influenced both by TC genesis location and ocean temperature (Wada and Chan 2008;Mei et al. 2015;Zhang et al. 2015). Previous studies suggested that factors such as the Pacific meridional mode (PMM), the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), and the Atlantic meridional mode (AMM) (see Supplemental Material) may also modulate WNP ACE (e.g., Chan 2008;Zhang et al. 2016a,c). The correlations between WNP ACE and the Ni\u00f1o-3.4 (significant at 0.01 level), PMM (significant at 0.01 level), and PDO (not significant at the 0.01 level) indices are positive, while the correlation between WNP ACE and the AMM is negative but not statistically significant (Fig. 26.1b, see Supplemental Material for more details of the indices). The Ni\u00f1o-3.4 and PMM indices in 2015 are strongly positive, contributing to the extreme 2015 WNP ACE. Therefore, internal climate modes, especially the strong El Ni\u00f1o, may have substantially contributed to the extreme 2015 WNP ACE by leading to an extremely high frequency of C45 TCs (Camargo and Sobel 2005)."}, {"section_title": "Effect of Anthropogenic Forcing.", "text": "We analyze two sets of experiments (i.e., 1990 control and 2 \u00d7 CO 2 experiments) with FLOR.

We select the ACE values in the 99th percentile of FLOR 1990 to calculate FAR, consistent with the percentile of the observed 2015 WNP ACE (Figs. 26.2a,b). The FAR in the 1990 control and 2 \u00d7 CO 2 experiments of FLOR are 0.81, indicating that anthropogenic forcing can substantially increase the risk of having extreme WNP ACE events higher than or equal to the 2015 event. To further substantiate this finding, we also analyze P 0 and P 1 in the two experiments of HiFLOR with radiative forcing representative of 1940 and 2015. The PDFs of WNP ACE in HiFLOR also have a fatter tail in the experiment with radiative forcing representative of 2015 compared with that of 1940 ( Fig. 26.2c). The FAR in HiFLOR is 0.80, close to 0.81 in the experiments with FLOR (Figs. 26.2b,c). We ran 35-member simulations with all forcing (natural and anthropogenic under RCP 4.5 scenario) and 30-member multidecadal simulations with natural forcing from 1961 to 2040 (see Supplemental Material).

There is a sharp increase in P(x = 95th percentile) during 2020-40 ( Fig. 26.2d). In addition, the P(x = 95th percentile) in nat_forcing experiments also largely increases in 1960-2060, except for a slight decrease from 1960-80 to 1980-2000. The P(x = 95th percentile) in all_forcing experiments are higher than those in nat_forcing experiments, indicating that anthropogenic forcing increases the risk of having extreme WNP ACE events. The results based on FLOR-FA 1860 and 1990 control experiments are also shown in the left of Fig. 26.2d, providing additional support to these conclusions. For each 20-year subperiod in 1980-2040, ENSO produces the largest variability of WNP ACE (Fig. 26.2d). The variability associated with ENSO is larger than that associated with radiative forcing (Fig. 26.2d). Therefore, the extreme 2015 WNP ACE may be mainly modulated by natural climate modes, especially by the strong El Ni\u00f1o, with the anthropogenic forcing increasing the risk of 2015 having a season with an extremely high WNP ACE. This risk is predicted to continue to increase in the next few decades, increasing the probability of having seasons with a WNP ACE equal to or higher than 2015 in the future. Discussions and Conclusions. We have observed an extremely active TC season in the WNP in 2015, with an extremely high ACE and frequency of C45 TCs. The 2015 season may be caused mainly by warm ocean surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific, characterized by a strong El Ni\u00f1o event, with other climate modes (e.g., PMM) potentially playing a role. We have found that anthropogenic forcing has substantially increased the risk of having WNP ACE higher than or equal to such an extreme event. Although the changes in WNP ACE under anthropogenic forcing are still unclear (e.g., Emanuel 2013; Lin and Chan 2015), both GFDL FLOR and HiFLOR do suggest that the annual WNP ACE tends to become more extreme because of anthropogenic forcing. The two models also suggest that the variability of WNP ACE attributable to climate modes will increase at a much higher rate than as a result of anthropogenic forcing. The frequency of strong El Ni\u00f1o events is projected to increase due to greenhouse warming (Cai et al. 2014), which in turn could potentially lead to a higher frequency of WNP seasons with high values of ACE."}, {"section_title": "S137", "text": "DECEMBER 2016 AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY | with a state-of-the-art ocean-sea ice general circulation model (OGCM).

(a) Over the years, authors contributing to this report have also taken on the challenge of quantifying the impacts of climate change. We have increasingly emphasized this because to make attribution results informative to adaptation decisions, scientists must take on the questions of whether the risk or magnitudes of such events have increased or decreased, by how much, and what level of confidence supports the claims. Going forward, report authors will continue to clearly state not only the magnitude and nature of the impacts, but the confidence in their conclusions. While we have made great strides in communicating the exact role of climate change, we still struggle with ensuring that the confidence in the conclusions is also conveyed. This year we also added a methods column to the Summary Table 28.1. While we have limited data at this time, it will be interesting to see what methodological approaches are being applied for different event types and regions as the science evolves. It was also exciting to see that even after five years and over 100 events examined, investigators are still finding new event types with which to explore the role of climate change. This year we had contributions on novel event types including extreme sunshine in the United Kingdom, \"sunny day\" flooding in the south-eastern United States, and snowpack drought in the U.S. mountain west. What might be a bright spot for the United Kingdom is that investigators found that extreme winter sunshine there, as observed in the record high 2014/15 season, has become more than 1.5 times more likely to occur under the influence of human-caused climate change. The southeastern United States has a less positive outlook when it comes to sunny day coastal flooding. Even without a cloud in the sky or a storm on the horizon, the Miami, Florida, region is more likely to experience tidal flooding because of long-term sea level rise caused by global warming. In the U.S. Cascade Mountains, a 2015 \"snowpack drought\" resulted from unprecedented warmth that caused cold-season precipitation to fall as rain rather than snow on the mountains. Investigators found that because of climate change this event could be recurrent in the future. As observed in years past, all the papers that looked at heat events around the world-from Egypt, Australia, Europe, Indonesia, Asia, India, and Pakistan-all found that climate change played a role in increasing the severity of the event. In addition, many of these events were influenced by both El Ni\u00f1o and natural variability, and in all cases researchers were able to distinguish between these drivers. For example, while El Ni\u00f1o conditions normally have a cooling impact on Japan in July-August, the 2015 summer was still unexpectedly hot. Authors isolated the various influences and showed that intraseasonal disturbances including tropical cyclones were the main drivers, but that human-caused warming increased the likelihood by 1.5 to 1.7 times. The results of individual event attribution studies can be put into context by looking at the broader This year's event types include tropical cyclones, extreme sunshine, nuisance tidal flooding, snowpack drought, forest fires, and Arctic sea ice extent in addition to heat, cold, precipitation, and drought.

However, it is a highly simplified categorization of the results and does not include information about the size of the signal detected or the confidence in the results. This information is found within each individual report and provides essential context for understanding and interpreting results for any individual event. Also, while these reports may be the first analysis for many of these events, they may not be the last. Additional research on any of these events may uncover new information that helps provide a more complete understanding for the role of climate change."}, {"section_title": "S142", "text": "DECEMBER 2016 | "}]
