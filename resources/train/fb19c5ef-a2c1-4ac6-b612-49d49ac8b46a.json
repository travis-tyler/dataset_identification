[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "ABSTRACT"}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic, incurable, irreversible neurodegenerative disorder and multifaceted disease which along with other neurodegenerative diseases, represents the largest area of unmet need of modern medical science [2] . The cognitive decline caused by this disorder leads to behavioral change, loss of memory and thinking skills and ultimately effects the simpler task performance. The disease begins with mild deterioration and ultimately worse in neurodegenerative type of dementia. Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is possible but it is very costly, time-taken and medically infeasible. It requires very careful medical assessment such as patient history, behavioral pattern analysis and different physical and neurobiological exam.\nBioinformatics field providing a great support to modern medical science. Bioinformatics is the application of tools of computation and to the capture and interpretation of biological data. A lot of computational methods have been used to assist modern biology. Computational tools are very efficient in recognizing pattern of diseases, handing big sample data, analyzing and interpreting the sample data. Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's diseases etc. fallows a great patterns in patients, which can be analyzed by machine learning techniques, computational tools and software.\nAlzheimer's disease neuronal dysfunction mainly causes due to failure of functional integration and damage in neural connectivity network [8] . Brain is the center of human nervous system which is made of 100 billion nerves that communicate in trillions of connections called synapses. In past three decades, a rich study on recognizing neural pattern have provided plenty of knowledge about defected neural connection in AD. A number of computational tools and software have developed to collect this information [7] .\nSarraf et al., [8] used convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify Alzheimer brain and normal healthy brain. They used MRI slices of Alzheimer patient and normal healthy brain from ADNI databank and pre-processed the image using the standard modules of FMRIB library v5.0. Images were labelled for binary classification of Alzheimer's Vs normal dataset and these labelled images were converted to Imdb storage databases for higher throughput to be fed into Deep learning platform. The study used CNN and famous architecture LeNet-5 and successfully classified fMRI data of Alzheimer's patient from normal controls. The accuracy of test data on training data reached 96.85 %, which was trained and tested with huge number of images. This study also showed a novel path to use more complicated computational architecture and classifiers to increase the efficient and effective pre-clinical diagnosis of AD.\nThere are lot of genetic factors that influence common and complex traits human behavior. The characterization of the effects of those factors is both a goal and challenge for modern geneticists. In the last couple of years, the field has been revolutionized by the success of genome-wide association (GWA) studies [10] [11] . Gene is a basic physical and functional unit of heredity. Gene made up of DNA, act as instructions to make molecules called protein. The one goal of modern geneticists is to identify genes with specific DNA sequence variations that increase or decrease susceptibility of disease [5] . In past years many researches focused on finding genetic architecture of diseases. Gene-gene interaction or epistasis is a ubiquitous component of the genetic architecture of common human diseases. Musameh et al., [4] aimed to investigate the role of gene-gene interactions in common variants in candidate cardiovascular genes in coronary artery disease (CAD)."}, {"section_title": "Meng et al., [3]", "text": "explored gene-gene interactions that have the potential to partially fill the missing heritability. Though in the previous studies interesting genes have been found, they identified such interesting genes which had no strong main effect on hypertension but which having indirect effect on hypertension prone genes. The paper provides evidence that the genomewide gene-gene interaction analysis has the possibility to identify new susceptibility genes, which can provide more knowledge and insights into the genetic pattern of blood pressure regulation and its effect on hypertension.\nGilbert-Diamond et al., [5] introduced the basics and importance of gene-gene interaction in identifying disease susceptibility genes. The paper analyzed several statistical and computational methods for characterizing and detecting genes with effects that are dependent on other genes. They focused on genetic association studies of discrete and quantitative traits because most of the methods for detecting gene-gene interactions have been developed by using these methods. The paper introduced the gene-gene interaction, use of gene-gene interaction and challenges in this research field. They described methods for detecting gene-gene interaction in association studies of discrete traits like logistic regression and multifactor dimensionality reduction. In association studies of quantitative traits methods like linear regression and combinational partitioning method also discussed. Lastly paper also proved the advantage of genome wide approach in place of traditional candidate-gene approach.\nGene-phenotype relationship is so complex that machine learning approaches have a considerable appeal as a strategy foe modelling interactions. A number of such methods have been developed and applied in recent years with some modest success. Koo et al., [1] presented an overview of several machine learning techniques to solve gene-gene interaction problem in genetic epidemiology. Traditional statistical methods are not efficient due to the curse of high dimensionality of data and occurrence of multiple polymorphism. This paper gives an overview of machine learning techniques support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RFs) and neural networks (NNs) and its application in detecting gene environment interactions. They also analyzed machine learning techniques which are most suitable to implement on gene-gene interaction like genetic programming neural network (GPNN), back propagation neural network (BPNN), grammatical evolution neural network (GENN), Recursive feature addition (SVM-RFA), Recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), local search (SVM-Local), genetic algorithm (SVM-GA) and mutual information network guided RF method (MINGRF). Lastly this paper also discussed the strengths and weakness of all the variants of Support vector machine, random forest and neural networks in implementing and detecting gene-gene interaction environment in complex human diseases.\nNowadays genome-wide association studies have offered thousands of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs). This study is important to unravel the genetic basis to complex multifactorial diseases. The greatest challenge is to discover gene-gene interactions among large amount of data having multiple polymorphisms. Thus various promising software have been developed for epistasis interactions. Sirava et al., [2] developed a tool for modeling, analyzing and visualizing biochemical pathways and networks of genomes and array data. The software tool BioMiner is based on new comprehensive, extensible and reusable data model called BioCore. The paper presented two applications, PathFinder and PathViewer. PathFinder predicting biochemical pathways by comparing groups of related organisms based on sequence similarity and successfully tested in number of experiments. PathViwer is an application for visualizing metabolic networks and supports the graphical comparison of metabolic networks of different organisms. Koo et al., [12] gives an overview on the software that had been used to detect genegene interactions that bring the effect on common and multifactorial diseases. Lastly in this paper sources, link, strength and weakness of the software that has been widely used in detecting epistasis interactions in complex human diseases also analyzed.\nWe used state-of-the-art gene dataset id GDS4758 from The National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), which provides free access to biomedical and genomic datasets. Dataset consists of 79 sample counts postmortem brain tissues pathologically diagnosed as having AD and normal patient. Dataset is in .CEL affymatrix format. We used most efficient method for preprocessing of microarray data, normalization in R using Robust Multi-array average or Robust Multi-chip average (RMA) method. We use AltAnalyze software for microarray data processing, which includes several basic expression. Statistics are comprised of following steps-rawp, adjp, log-fold, fold change, ANOVA rawp, ANOVA adjp and max log-fold. Then we use probe set filtering in output files of AltAnalyze using p-value (<0.05) and fold count (>2). We get 20 interesting genes. Then we analyze 20 interesting gene network using GeneMania and draw relevant conclusions from these gene-gene interaction network. The paper's organization is as fallows.

There are many sources of noise in microarray experiments like different amount of RNA used for labelling and hybridization, imperfectness on the array surface, imperfect synthesis of the probes and difference in hybridization conditions etc. Systematic differences due to noise in place of true biological variability should be removed in order to make biologically meaningful conclusions about the data. There are many techniques for the pre-processing of microarray data. R hasan et al., [13] discussed some of the most important preprocessing techniques applicable to Affymetrix microarray platform.\nOne of the most efficient method for pre-processing microarray data is normalization in R using Robust Multi-array average or Robust Multi-chip average (RMA). RMA method for computing an expression measure begins by computing back-ground correlated perfect match intensities for each perfect match cell on every GeneChip. Background-corrected intensity is calculated for each PM probe in such a way that all background corrected intensities are positive. After that base-2 logarithm of the background-corrected intensity is calculated for each probe. This will male data more skewed and more normally distributed and provide an equal spread of up and down regulated expression ratios. Next step is for quantile normalization to correct for variation between the arrays. It equalizes the data distributions of the arrays and make the samples completely comparable. After that last st between probe sets, which equalizes the behavior of the probes between the arrays and combines normalized data values of probes from a probe set into a single value for the whole probe set.

Filtering allows us for the reduction in number of tests and a corresponding increase in analysis power. We use p-value, midas p-value, fold count and si p-value as a filter during microarray analysis.\np-value helps in determining significance of microarray gene-gene interaction analysis. P-value is the level of marginal significance within a statistical hypothesis test representing the probability of the occurrence of the given event. In most of the microarray analysis p-value is set to be (< 0.05). p-value (< 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so we can reject the null hypothesis. A large p-value (>0.05) indicates weak evidence against the null hypothesis, so we will fail to reject the null hypothesis. Thus p-value approach to hypothesis testing uses the calculated probability to determine whether there is evidence to reject the null hypothesis. In our research we set p-value thresholding as p-value <0.05.\nMicroarray detection of alternative splicing (Midas) p-value calculate an alternative splicing score based on Midas method. Si p-value means significant p-value. We used filtering limits of <0.05 for both, Midas p-value and si p-value. Another important filter in microarray analysis is fold change. Fold change is a measure describing how much a quantity changes going from an initial to final value. As per [14] fold count (>1.5) or (>2) produces most interesting genes in microarray analysis. Dalman et al., [15] analyzed different combinations of p-value and fold counts in microarray analysis and concluded to use fold count (>2) and p-value (<0.05). We use same filters thresholding in our research work."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Microarray gene-gene interaction analysis using Altanalyze produces a five output files in delimited text format that can be opened in Microsoft Excel for better visualization. These files consists of a lot of gene-gene interaction information of input .CEL dataset. File #1 reports gene expression values for each sample and group in your probeset input expression file. The values are derived from probe sets that align to regions of a gene that are common to all transcripts and thus are informative for transcription (unless all probe sets are selected -see \"Select expression analysis parameters\", above) and expressed above specified background levels. Along with the raw gene expression values, statistics for each indicated comparison (mean expression, folds, ttest p-values) will be included along with gene annotations for that array, including putative microRNA binding sites. This file is analogous to the results file you would have with a typical, non-exon microarray experiment and is saved to the folder \"ExpressionOutput\".\nResults from files #2-5 are produced from all probe sets that may suggest alternative splicing, alterative promoter regulation, or any other variation relative to the constitutive gene expression for that gene (derived from comparisons file). Each set of results correspond to a single pair-wise comparison (e.g., cancer vs. normal) and will be named with the group names you assigned (groups file).\nFile #2 reports probe sets that are alternatively regulated, based on the user defined splicing-index score and p-value. We get gene-gene interaction network as seen in figure 2 . This network consists of 40 genes. 20 genes (having cross-hatched circle) are the most interesting genes from the output file#2 and remaining 20 genes (having solid circle) are relevant genes having most connectivity with interesting genes.
