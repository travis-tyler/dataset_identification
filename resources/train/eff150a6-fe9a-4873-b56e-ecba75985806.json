Findings indicate that parental involvement in their children's homework had a substantial effect on achievement test scores and that the extent of television viewing had no effect. Parental educational aspirations had a positive effect on overall achievement, and family structure had a small negative effect. Students' perceptions of parental involvement were more important than were parents' reports of participation. Eleven figures are included.

In fact, research is far from consistent in supporting parental involvement effects, and numerous questions remain. Here we present research concerning the effects of parental involvement on achievement for a national sample of eighth graders and their parents. The research was conducted on over 21,000 students and their parents from the National Education Longitudinal Study. LISREL was used to determine the effects of parental involvement on achievement, to compare the effects of various components of parental involvement, and to compare the effects of students' versus parents' perceptions of involvement. This research begins to answer several unanswered questions concerning the effects of parental involvement on student learning. The findings to be presented thus have implications for group programs and individual interventions designed to increase parental involvement. Research evidence does indeed suggest that parental involvement may improve students' learning (Epstein, 1984(Epstein, , 1991, but there are many inconsistencies in the research findings (Keith, 1991). A recent review of parental involvement research concluded that the effects of parental involvement may vary with the age of the students studied, with involvement being more effective for elementary than for high school youth. Little research has been conducted with middle school youth. Parental involvement research has used a variety of definitions of parental involvement, concentrating variously on parental aspirations, discussions of schooling and school work, participation in school activities, or a home structure that is oriented towards learning; the effects of parental involvement may also vary depending on the definition used (for a comparison of definitions, see Seginer, 1983). Parental involvement effects may also vary depending on the learning criterion used, with grades more easily affected than test scores (Fehrmann, Keith, & Reimers, 1987)."}, {"section_title": "Parental Involvement Effects 4", "text": "Finally, it is simply unknown whether actual involvement or the student's perceptions of involvement are more important for learning (for a complete review, see Keith, 1991). The primary objective of this study was to determine the extent of the influence of parental involvement on eighth grade students' achievement. We also sought to determine the relative importance of  (Bloom, 1984;Epstein, 1991;Keith, 1991;Reynolds & Walberg, 1990;Seginer, 1983)."}, {"section_title": "Data Source", "text": "Data were derived from the first wave of the National Education     "}]
