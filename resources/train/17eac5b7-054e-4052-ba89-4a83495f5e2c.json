[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: With the exception of APOE e4 allele, the common genetic risk factors for sporadic Alzheimer's Disease (AD) are unknown."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Age is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and with both life expectancy and population increases, its incidence is expected to double in the next two decades [1] . Genetic investigations have discovered some putative pathophysiological mechanisms related to the accumulation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the histopathological hallmarks of AD. The high incidence of dementia in Down's syndrome and analysis of the amino acid sequence of beta-amyloid has led to identification of a series of mutations associated with increased amyloid production. However, such mutations only account for a very small percentage of Alzheimer cases. Risk factors have been identified for the sporadic cases, which are the majority of AD patients, although these factors collectively explain a relatively modest amount of the genetic risk for AD [2] . The most significant of these is the presence of apolipoprotein E4 (APOE e4). The most commonly used strategies to find disease-related genes such as APOE have been linkage studies and candidate gene association studies. The late onset of Alzheimer's disease and the sporadic nature of most cases complicate family studies, although more than a dozen have been performed [2] . These family studies and the case-control studies strongly implicate multiple genetic loci in susceptibility to AD [2] . Candidate gene approaches targeting amyloid, tau, and inflammatory cascades have proved useful, yet the identification of other major risk factors have proved elusive, with few associations being replicated.\nThe recent availability of high-throughput genotyping has allowed the simultaneous measurement of hundreds of thousands to more than one million SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms), which has made genome-wide association studies (GWAS) feasible. A major challenge in case-control GWAS designs in which allele and genotype frequencies are compared between AD and control patients is achieving sufficient statistical power. Such categorical approaches require approximately 6,000 cases and controls to obtain 85% power to detect a 30% difference (odds-ratio of 1.3) with a minor allele frequency of 0.15 [3] . Quantitative trait association studies offer several advantages over case-control studies, since the dependent measures are quantitative and more objective than diagnostic categorization, and can increase the statistical power four to eight fold, thus greatly decreasing the required sample size to achieve sufficient statistical power [4] .\nWe present the results of a GWAS in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, a longitudinal multi-site observational study including AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and elderly individuals with normal cognition [5] assessing clinical and cognitive measures, MRI and PET scans (FDG and 11 C PIB) and blood and CNS biomarkers. Major goals of ADNI are to make this wealth of data available to the general scientific community and to improve methods for clinical trials by optimizing methods for imaging that are associated with clinical symptoms and the conversion of MCI to AD. The clinical and imaging measures from this longitudinal study have previously been made publicly available; the genome-wide genotyping results for 793 subjects from the Illumina Human610-Quad BeadChip (Illumina Corporation, San Diego, CA) as performed by The Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen, Phoenix, AZ), are now also publicly available.\nIn this initial analysis of the AD and the healthy control subsets of the data, we first performed a case control analysis and found APOE as well as an associated gene TOMM40, that provides additional risk for developing AD.\nTo complement the case-control/candidate gene approach to discover new risk genes for AD we performed a QT (quantitative trait) analysis. Our method uses the hippocampal grey matter density from neuroimaging as the quantitative trait, and examines which SNPs (as proxies for genes) influence the quantitative trait differently for AD and healthy controls. The concentration of grey matter in the hippocampus [6] was chosen as the QT phenotype as it is affected early in AD, is implicated in the conversion to and progress of AD [7, 8] and is associated with many of the cardinal symptoms, and it can be reliably measured in vivo. We used differences in the total grey matter concentration of the hippocampal area, (the four CA fields of the hippocampus proper, plus dentate gyrus, subiculum, entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampal gyrus) in AD subjects vs normal aged-matched controls in our model, since MRI studies have suggested that reductions in hippocampus over time can be particularly useful in predicting AD before the onset of clinical symptoms, and in assessing the efficacy of pharmacological treatment in clinical trials [9] [10] [11] [12] . Therefore, in our GWA study we used hippocampal concentration as an imaging phenotype to reveal genes that potentially influence hippocampal atrophy and dementia in the context of AD. The genes which influence hippocampal grey matter concentration differentially in AD and healthy subjects may provide important information regarding the mechanisms of disease-related atrophy. The power of this approach is demonstrated in the results implicating novel genes which have been implicated in candidate neurodegenerative mechanisms."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Ethics", "text": "For the purpose of this analysis we used ADNI subject data that was previously collected across 50 sites.

The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Brain imaging, biological samples, and clinical assessments are longitudinally collected for a target of 200 healthy controls, 400 MCI, and 200 AD subjects. For the AD sample, the study focuses on identification of sporadic cases of mild AD, subjects between the ages of 55-90, with an MMSE score of 20-26 inclusive and meeting NINCDS/ADRDA criteria for probable AD [13] [14] [15] , and having an MRI consistent with the diagnosis of AD. Major goals of ADNI are to make this wealth of data available to the general scientific community and to improve methods for clinical trials by optimizing methods for imaging that are associated with diagnosis and clinical symptoms. In this analysis we contrast the AD subjects with healthy controls. This analysis is confined to baseline diagnosis and MRI scans for each subject.\nFollowing volumetric analysis and genotyping quality control measures (described below), data from a total of 172 AD subjects and 209 healthy controls were included in this analysis."}, {"section_title": "Procedures", "text": "MRI. The data collection methods have been described in more detail in Jack et al., 2008 [16] , and Mueller et al. 2005 [5] . The images analyzed here were the baseline or screening scans at the entry to the study; they were collected using the standard ADNI protocol on 1.5T GE, Siemens, or Philips MR scanners [16] .\nThe analyzed datasets included the T1-weighted structural MRI scans from all available subjects. Following the segmentation and quality assurance defined below, a final dataset of 229 healthy controls and 194 AD subjects provided grey matter concentration estimates of the hippocampus, using a voxel-based morphometry approach.\nThe MRI images were converted from DICOM format into NIFTI format and re-oriented into MNI coordinate conventions using FSL tools [17] . They were then registered with the MNI brain atlas, corrected for intensity inhomogeneities and segmented into 3 classes (grey matter (GM), white matter (WM), and CSF) using the VBM toolbox integrated with the SPM5 package [6, 18] .\nDatasets with an extreme value of computed total brain density or the ratio of grey/white matter density were inspected, leading to the exclusion of several datasets in which segmentation was unsuccessful. Often, these were cases with large ventricles and/or diffuse white matter hypointensities. When there were multiple datasets per subject, the best segmentation for each subject was selected, blind to diagnosis or gender. The datasets of all subjects whose segmentation was successful were used to construct custom templates for the class prior probabilities. These custom templates were used in a second run to segment all datasets. To allow a comparison with the previous run, the same datasets were selected for further evaluation. Again, a quality check was performed using the total brain density and the ratio of grey/white matter density. The total grey matter was generally higher in this segmentation, which is very much expected with a better-matched template.\nThe right and left hippocampal regions were defined using the AAL brain atlas [19] , and the mean of the grey-matter fraction over voxels within those regions was computed for the final imaging phenotypes on each subject.\nGenotyping. Blood samples were obtained from each participant and sent to Pfizer for DNA extraction. All DNA extraction and genotyping was done blinded to group assignment.\nGenotyping on the blinded DNA was performed by TGen using the Illumina Human610-Quad BeadChip.\nApproximately 200 ng of DNA was used to genotype each subject sample according to the manufacturer's protocol (Illumina, San Diego, CA). After amplification, fragmentation and hybridization, the specifically hybridized DNA was fluorescently labeled by a single base extension reaction and detected using a BeadArray scanner. Non-specifically hybridized fragments were removed by washing while remaining specifically hybridized DNA were processed for the single base extension reaction, stained and imaged on an Illumina Bead Array Reader. Normalized bead intensity data obtained for each sample were loaded into the Illumina BeadStudio 3.2 software which generated SNP genotypes from fluorescent intensities using the manufacturer's default cluster settings. The data analyzed with BeadStudio are publicly available on the LONI website (www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/Data). The raw genotypic data were imported in a genome-wide data management system, i.e. SNPLims [20] , to allow the export of userdefined formats compatible with the genetic programs used for the statistical analysis.\nThe following Quality Control (QC) procedures were implemented on the genome-wide data. We performed all data analysis and QC using the PLINK software package (http://pngu.mgh. harvard.edu/purcell/plink/), release v1.05. DNA samples with a call rate,95% were excluded. The average call rate in the remaining samples was 99.4%. From a total of 600,470 SNPs in autosomal chromosomes (sex chromosomes, mitochondrial, and pseudo-autosomal SNPs were excluded), the intensity-only probes from chromosomes 1-22 were excluded (17,879), and 5,592 SNPs were excluded by the PLINK algorithm. SNPs were included in the imaging genetics analysis if their minor allele frequency (MAF) was..05, were present for.90% of the subjects, and did not depart from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for the controls using a threshold of 10 23 . (Some SNPs were excluded for more than one category). The final number of SNPs included in the analyses is 516,645.\nSince the Illumina chip does not include the SNPs associated with APOE alleles, a separate analysis was performed in which DNA was extracted from 3 ml blood samples. APOE genotyping was carried out on these samples by PCR amplification and HhaI restriction enzyme digestion. The genotype was resolved on 4% Metaphor Gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining [21] .\nStatistical Analysis. Differences in clinical and demographic values between these groups were analyzed by t test, chi-square or Fisher exact test using STATA10 [22] . Population stratification was examined with PLINK v1.5 and EIGENSTRAT [23, 24] and a lambda of 1.06 was observed, indicating no stratification.\nCase-control analysis. Because APOE e4 is a well documented risk factor for late onset AD, the Cochran-Armitage trend test was used to analyze the APOE e4 allele (which are results of ''diplotypes'' constructed on SNPs rs429358 and rs7412) distribution between healthy controls and AD patients.\nBased on the significance of our finding regarding APOE e4 in our sample and recent interest in this region we expanded our genotyping in the APOE region (,300-Kb on chromosome 19). To increase the map density in the APOE region, we 1) merged the results of the genotyping (performed with the APOE-specific genotyping) of SNPs rs429358 and rs7412 and 2) performed imputation. To impute the region, the set ''hapmap_r23'' was downloaded from the HapMap site. This dataset includes 270 subjects from each one of the 4 populations studied by HapMap, i.e. CEU, YRB and CHB+JPT for 267 SNPs [25] . The imputation was considered successful for 159 SNPs with an in-silico call rate.90% in this region. After imputation, the new dataset was used to calculate case-control association tests: 1) single marker association and 2) haplotypes proxy association. The proxy association test was calculated using the flanking markers in strong LD with the ''reference'' SNP (i.e. proxies).\nQuantitative Trait analysis. All autosomal SNPs that passed quality control checks were tested for quantitative trait association interaction using the general linear model as implemented in PLINK v1.5. The statistical model is based on comparing the differential effects of SNP association by diagnosis on the brain imaging quantitative trait, i.e. the interaction term.\nBased on the demographic analysis of our sample and the casecontrol allelic association test for APOE e4, we covaried for age and gender and for the number of APOE e4 alleles in the model. Out of the possible 4 models to choose from (i.e. additive, codominant, dominant and recessive) we a priori chose the additive model as it is the most general, both reflecting the additive contribution to risks for complex diseases [26] , and detecting strong non-additive effects.\nThe general linear model used to determine the interaction term was:\nin which b i represents the coefficients, SNP represents the genotype of each marker tested, APOE e4 represents the allele dose of e4, gender and diagnosis were coded as dichotomous variables, and age is the age of the subject in years.\nOur focus is on the SNP6diagnosis interaction. There is no accepted method for determining a statistical threshold for a quantitative trait interaction in a context of a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Given 516,645 SNPs and the sample size of 381 subjects, any result at 10 26 or smaller provides statistical evidence for a main effect associating a given SNP with a quantitative trait. There is a lack of consensus on how to identify a genome-wide significance threshold. Reaching a consensus definition for an appropriate statistical threshold for the interaction term in a GWAS is even more complex. For the purposes of presenting the initial analyses of our data and considering the small sample size, the number of variables analyzed and the complexity of the model, we chose a conservative hypothesis for a threshold of 10 26 for our interaction term. In keeping with recommendations for presenting a GWAS analysis [27] the results of all analyses are provided in the supplemental material.\nThe Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) maps of each chromosomal region harboring the most significant SNPs were created using a window size of6200 Kb. D' values were calculated using Haploview 4.1 [28] and visualized with WGAViewer software, Version 1.25W; 2009 (http://www.genome.duke.edu/centers/pg2/downloads/wgaviewer.php) [29] . The genetic annotation was performed using WGAViewer: SNPs location and gene names were derived from Ensembl release 52 -Dec 2008 (http://www. ensembl.org/) [30] .

The haplotype association via in silico reconstruction of proximal SNPs increases the importance of the findings at this locus. One of the haplotypes constructed with rs2075650 and the two flanking SNPs rs11556505 (TOMM40) and rs429358 (APOE) has greater significance (p-value = 1.50610 211 ) than the univariate p-value for the TOMM40 SNP."}, {"section_title": "QT analysis", "text": "The QT analysis identified 25 SNPs significant at the level of#10\n26 associated with either the left or right hippocampal grey matter volume (see Figure 1) . A Q-Q plot of the association results is presented in Figure 2 . P-values from the observed distribution of the test of interest (i.e., the SNPxDiagnosis interaction) are plotted for all SNPs against the null distribution: p-values show a deviation in excess in the upper tail distribution, suggesting the presence of significant genetic association. Such deviation becomes evident at a p,1610 26 supporting the hypothesis of a threshold for a claim of genetic association at this significance value. The significant SNPs (see Table 3 ) represent 15 loci and 6 desert regions. The QT analysis for all SNPs is provided in the supplementary materials (see Supplementary files). Of the 25 significant SNPs, thirteen map directly in genes and pseudogenes or are linked based on the LD structure of the region. Four SNPs map in regions characterized by a high level of genomic complexity given the overlap of several different genes and isoforms or pseudogenes in these areas. Eight SNPs map to 6 different ''desert'' regions where no specific gene annotation could be found including the LD block structure of the region. Details of these 25 significant SNPs follow.

Due to the low degree of LD and the few SNPs typed that passed QC, it is not possible to link this SNP to any annotated genes. The genomic area surrounding this locus seems conserved based on the LD pattern, though, and might be of interest as it contains 2 additional isoforms of the same olfactory receptor pseudogene (OR7E) with different functions (i.e. rRNA and snRNA) overlapping with the gene FRMD6.\nSNP rs4845552 (p-value = 6.23610 26 ) on chromosome 1 is located ,7-Kbp from the locus AL157404.18, hypothetically coding a transcription regulatory misc RNA.

SNP rs6031882 (p-value = 6.20610"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The goal of this paper was to present an initial QT analysis combining imaging and genetic data obtained in a GWAS from the ADNI cohort, in addition to a standard case-control analysis. Our aim was to make publicly available genotype data for AD and controls in the context of rich multimodal imaging data and comprehensive clinical data that can be investigated by the research community, as well as conducting a preliminary analysis to identify potential genes related to the susceptibility of AD. The case-control analysis confirmed the association with APOE alleles, as expected, and also implicated TOMM40, a gene physically close to APOE that contributes additional risk to developing AD [31, 32] The application of a QT analysis for the interaction of genotypes with diagnosis, however, allowed us to identify novel candidate genes at high levels of genome-wide significant SNPs. We found a strong main effect for the APOE e4 allele on the hippocampal volume. However, we did not find a diagnosis by allele interaction relative to APOE e4, suggesting that APOE alleles affect hippocampal volume similarly in both AD patients and healthy controls. This is consistent with most, but not all, of the literature finding an association of APOE e4 with accelerated age-related volume loss in hippocampus and several other brain regions as well as in AD [33] [34] [35] [36] . These results suggest an effect of APOE 4 on the brain atrophy, independent from its overrepresentation in AD.\nThe rationale of this study is that hippocampal atrophy in AD subjects is more objective and closer to the genes contributing to AD than the clinical subjective diagnosis of AD alone. Hippocampal atrophy is characterized by neuronal loss and decreased synaptic density and is believed to be caused by the accumulation of neuropathological events in addition to the observed amyloid and tau pathology [37] . Apoptosis, cell cycle impairment and the alteration of protein folding and degradation through ubiquination are among the candidate pathophysiological mechanisms that may underlie neurodegeneration in AD [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . Based on our preliminary functional annotation, our significant SNPs related to genes PRUNE2, MAGI2, ARSB, EFNA5, CAND1 may be associated with these biochemical and cellular changes.\nWe found associations between hippocampal volume reductions in AD subjects and the EFNA5 (ephrin-A5), ARSB (arylsulfatase B), MAGI2 (membrane associated guanylate kinase, WW and PDZ domain containing 2), PRUNE2 (prune homolog 2), and CAND1 (cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated 1) genes. These genes are associated with the aforementioned biochemical processes, namely ubiquination (MAGI2, CAND1), apoptosis (CAND1, PRUNE2), oxidative necrosis (ARSB), hippocampal development (EFNA5), and dementia, (MAGI2, ARBS). The presence of the highly conserved BCH domain (BNIP2 and Cdc42GAP homology) in PRUNE2 which is involved in a variety of protein-protein interactions and the presence of the BNIP-2 domain, a substrate for caspase cleavage suggest a role for PRUNE2 in apoptosis [46] . CAND1 allows the complex formation between CUL1 and SKP [47] . Cullins (CUL) are scaffold proteins for the ubiquitin ligase complex, and neddylation of cullin enhances its ability to promote ubiquitination [48] . NEDD8 has been found in ubiquitinated neurofibrillary tangles in the AD brain [49] . The conjugation of NEDD8 is stimulated by the interaction of APP with APP-BP1 that mediates APP-induced apoptosis in the AD brain [50] .\nMAGI2, together with ATN1 (atrophin 1), has been implicated in Dentato-Rubral and PallidoLuysian Atrophy (DRPLA), a disease with a syndrome of myoclonic epilepsy, dementia, ataxia, and choreoathetosis [51] . MAGI2 has been speculated to play a critical role in the ubiquitination process of ATN1 by linking ubiquitinating enzyme to plasma membrane proteins, neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels [51] . Perturbation of the ubiquitin system could potentially lead to increased misfolded protein accumulation and cell cycle abnormalities, and apoptosis [52] .\nThe gene EFNA5 is highly expressed in the human brain and hippocampus. Ephrin-A5 is a member of the Ephrin (Eph) superfamily implicated in mediating developmental events in the nervous system [53, 54] . The Ephrin family of receptors regulates cell morphology and behavior by rearranging the actin cytoskeleton through the Rho family of small G-proteins [55] . Eph-A receptor signaling has been directly implicated in axon guidance, while Eph-B receptor signaling has been linked to dendritic spine morphogenesis [56] . EFNA5 and its interactions with other axon guidance genes have been linked to susceptibility to developing Parkinson's disease [57] . It is possible that the EFNA5 findings are consistent with a neurodevelopmental process in both AD and Parkinson's disease. ARSB (Arylsulfatase B) is a lysosomal enzyme that removes the sulfate ester group of N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfate in dermatan and chondroitin sulfate. A mutation in this enzyme leads to the development of the lysosome storage disease called mucopolysaccharidosis VI [58] . The accumulation of amyloid b peptide (A\\) is toxic to neuronal cells by inducing oxidative stress [59] . In response to oxidative stress, alterations of various endosomallysosomal components including ARSB have been observed in AD brains [60, 61] . This fact could support the hypothesis that ARSB is involved in the modulation of the oxidative stress pathway and neuronal loss in the development of AD.\nOur results highlight the variety of data that can be obtained from these different analytic approaches. Previous GWASs in AD using a categorical approach have not been able to consistently identify risk genes in AD other than APOE [62] . To further evaluate our finding of no interaction with diagnosis and APOE we performed a QT analysis removing APOE-related SNPs. The results of the analysis were very similar with the addition of a single SNP, rs8027305 in THSD4, significant at p#10 It is important to emphasize that the SNPs from the Illumina Human610-Quad BeadChip are tagging SNPs and as such represents ''flags'' for a possible location of a susceptibility locus to AD, and rarely -if ever -are the causal SNPs. The advantage of a tagging SNPs approach is that it maps an average 10 to max 20 kilobases in which a causal DNA variant may be found, thus indicating an area of focus for gene sequencing and subsequent studies of molecular mechanisms. The genes that we identified by surrogate SNPs are candidates that require additional confirmation in independent samples. Our method using brain imaging as a quantitative trait is fundamentally different from case-control approaches as it begins with brain imaging as a dependent variable and then identifies as genes that affect the brain imaging differences between AD and healthy controls. This is a very different contrast than comparing frequencies of genotypes across cases and controls and therefore is not expected to identify the same results as a QT approach. Interestingly, some of our findings are located in putative hot spots regions for AD, previously identified by other investigators using case-control, linkage and other methods. These overlapping hot spots include regions on chromosomes 5 [63] , 9 [64] [65] [66] , and 14 [67] .\nThe sample only contained mild AD patients, a relatively narrow range of illness, and therefore is not fully representative of the disease. Also, the ADNI sample was not collected under an epidemiological ascertainment strategy and the sample size itself is small, further limiting its generalizability. The small sample size, however, was somewhat mitigated by the four to eightfold increase in statistical power of a quantitative trait design over a categorical case-control analysis [4, 68] . Our case control analysis suffered from inadequate power relative to the more powered QT analysis. Nevertheless, the possibility of false positives remains. Also, there is no a definitive established method for determining appropriate statistical threshold values for an interaction term (i.e., SNP6diag-nosis) in a QT analysis in the context of a genome-wide scan. Our solution was to consider the physical clustering of SNPs and their biological plausibility and to report the full extent of our findings in the paper and supplemental tables. This allows the reader to consider our preliminary results in terms of their statistical and biological consistency given the multiple testing issues. This is similar to the strategy used by Almasy et al. 2008 [69] .\nHippocampal volume was chosen as our quantitative phenotype because of its sensitivity to the changes of early AD disease [70] . Clinical diagnosis of AD in part depends on subjective reporting by the patient and caretaker. The clinical presentation may be more distal from the underlying genetic causes than the brain atrophy that usually predates symptoms by many years. Identifying genes that contribute to hippocampal atrophy have the potential to identify novel genes and pathways involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease at its earliest stages. It is possible that other brain imaging phenotypes would identify other candidate genes."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This QT study is a cross-sectional analysis of baseline hippocampal grey matter density with common genetic variants as measured by SNP genotypes in the ADNI sample.

Elucidating the roles of PRUNE2, MAGI2, ARSB and EFNA5 in the regulation of neurodevelopment, protein degradation, apoptosis and neuronal loss could enhance our understanding of hippocampal atrophy and AD. This method of gene discovery complements other established strategies such as case-control designs with large sample sizes, family-based design, and targeted candidate gene approaches. To address the concerns of multiple testing and false positive findings, all genotyped data are publicly available (LONI, http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/Data/) for combining with other datasets and for other analytical approaches by the scientific community.
