[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "We characterise the representation of the Southern Ocean water mass structure and sea ice within a suite of 15 global ocean-ice models run with the Coordinated Ocean-ice Reference Experiment Phase II (CORE-II) protocol.

Thus we rely on climate models to complement observations. Modelling strategies include, but are not limited to, assimilated solutions tightly constrained to observations, varying parameters in individual models, and international multimodel efforts. The Coordinated Ocean-ice Reference Experiments (CORE; Danabasoglu et al. (2014) ; Griffies et al. (2009) ) fall under the latter category. The goal of the second phase of this modelling effort (CORE-II) is to contribute to future model development by investigating the hypothesis that multiple models computing fluxes based on identical bulk formulae and the same prescribed atmospheric state ) produce similar ocean and ice representations of the past and present climate. Griffies et al. (2009) evaluated seven ocean-ice models forced with CORE-I Normal Year Forcing (Large and Yeager, 2004) , and results were presented from primarily global and/or zonally averaged viewpoints. Here we expand upon the CORE-I effort by evaluating the representation of present and multi-year to decadal observed trends in 15 CORE-II interannually forced models. To capitalise on the CORE-II effort, several regional studies are presently being undertaken, and are contributing to a special issue of Ocean Modelling. For example, Danabasoglu et al. (2014) evaluated the North Atlantic region, Griffies et al. (2014) focussed on sea-level processes, and studies pertaining to the Indian, Pacific and Arctic basins are underway. These publications will provide a detailed model assessment of key circulation, water mass, and sea-ice processes important to global climate modelling.\nGiven the complex and vast research areas pertaining to Southern Ocean circulation (see Rintoul and Naveira Garabato, 2013 , for a review), the CORE-II analysis for this region has been divided into two papers. The first Southern Ocean paper presented here has two foci: i) properties of upper ocean water masses that are key players in the storage and uptake of anthropogenic carbon (cf., Sabine et al., 2004) ; and ii) sea-ice concentration and extent, which has a first-order role in ocean surface heat and freshwater fluxes. The companion Southern Ocean paper (Farneti et al., 2015) assesses the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) transport and meridional overturning circulation of the Southern Ocean, with an emphasis on mesoscale processes.\nWe discuss here the properties of the three primary water masses forming in the Southern Ocean, namely Sub-Antarctic Mode Water (SAMW), Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW), and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), as well as the deep seasonal mixed layer depths associated with their formation. The subduction of mode and intermediate waters is strongly influenced by the flux of water across the mixed layer base (e.g. Sall\u00e9e et al., 2010a) . The depth of the seasonal mixed layers is governed by overlying wind and buoyancy forcing at the ocean surface, as well as sea ice via both freshwater from melting ice transported equatorward and isolation of the ocean from atmospheric buoyancy fluxes. Strong winter surface buoyancy loss excites vigorous mixing across the mode and intermediate water mass formation regions in the southeast Indian and Pacific basins, resulting in deep mixed layers exceeding 500 m (de Boyer Mont\u00e9gut et al., 2004; Holte and Talley, 2009) . In summer, these mixed layer depths reduce to approximately 100 m (Sall\u00e9e et al., 2010b) . AABW forms primarily in the Weddell Sea, Ross Sea and along the Adelie coast through the combined diapycnal mixing of southward flowing Circumpolar Deep Waters and the high salinity shelf waters made dense due to brine rejection (cf., Orsi et al., 1999; Speer et al., 2000; Rintoul and Naveira Garabato, 2013) . The companion Southern Ocean CORE-II manuscript by Farneti et al. (2015) addresses the formation, circulation, and associated buoyancy fluxes of AABW.\nObservations and models have indicated that most of the ocean surface has warmed and freshened over the past half century (Durack and Wijffels, 2010; Helm et al., 2011) , shifting the surface density outcrops poleward. Reduced surface density (increased buoyancy) enhances stratification in the upper ocean and leads to shoaling of the deep winter mixed layers associated with the subduction of mode and intermediate waters (e.g., Downes et al., 2010; Sall\u00e9e et al., 2010b) . In addition, less entrainment of cold deeper water into the mixed layer (due to enhanced upper ocean stratification) can compensate for the negative surface heat flux feedback response to increasing sea surface temperature (Large and Yeager, 2012) . Despite a coherent shoaling response to increased greenhouse gases, numerous coarse resolution coupled climate models represent mixed layer depths shallower than observed due to excessive overlying freshwater input (Sall\u00e9e et al., 2013a) . Here we investigate the role of both heat and freshwater fluxes in dictating the mixed layer depth and isopycnal outcropping in models compared to observations. Two other factors contribute to the surface buoyancy fluxes that influence the mixed layer depths associated with mode and intermediate waters: the surface wind stress; and the salinification and freshening associated with the freezing of sea ice and in-situ thermodynamic melting. The strong westerly winds overlying the ACC induce a northward Ekman transport, driving cooler high latitude waters into the upper ocean water mass mixed layer regions (e.g., Naveira Garabato et al., 2009) . Also, between the latitude of the maximum westerlies (\u223c47\u00b0S) and the peak of the easterlies (\u223c73\u00b0S), the winds act to upwell warm, salty and carbon-rich waters from the deep ocean. These winds have strengthened and shifted poleward over the past few decades (e.g., Thompson and Solomon, 2002; Chen and Held, 2007; Thompson et al., 2011) , enhancing upwelling and northward surface Ekman transport.\nTrends in sea ice are not uniform around the Antarctic continent. Sea-ice concentration has decreased in the AmundsenBellingshausen Sea in recent decades (Abram et al., 2013; Comiso and Nishio, 2008; Simpkins et al., 2013; Zwally et al., 2002) , associated with increased polar freshening and atmospheric influences (Holland and Kwok, 2012; Turner et al., 2009 ). Conversely, sea-ice concentration has increased in the Ross Sea and climate models fail to represent these observed trends (Abram et al., 2013; Comiso and Nishio, 2008; Zwally et al., 2002) . We investigate the ability of the CORE-II models to represent these distinct regional sea-ice trends, and the resultant influence on upper Southern Ocean water mass properties.\nThis study assesses whether the CORE-II ocean-ice models are a viable tool for process-based research, by evaluating their Table 1 The CORE-II models analysed in this paper. The model name is that used throughout the text. Ocean model features noted are grid resolution (x is longitude, y is latitude, L is number of vertical levels) and vertical coordinate (z is the geopotential [negative downward from a resting ocean surface], z * is the rescaled geopotential incorporating sea surface undulations, \u03c3 is terrain following, \u03c3 2 is using an isopycnal coordinate referenced to the 2000 dbar, H is hybrid, and m is mass representation of the past and present climate mixed layer depths, water masses, and sea ice. We discuss whether differences in the modelled magnitude and spatial distribution of water mass and sea-ice properties are likely to be associated with the common CORE-II atmospheric state, or with differences in individual model configurations. The remainder of this paper is divided as follows. In Section 2, we briefly describe the 15 participating CORE-II models, data, and methodology to be used for model evaluation. In Section 3 we evaluate the 1988-2007 mean, and in Section 4 we describe linear trends over the same years, comparing past and present states with the observation-based data set to be used where available. In Section 5, we provide a summary and schematic representation of our key findings."}, {"section_title": "Methods, models and data", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Models, forcing and analysis periods", "text": "An extensive description of the 15 CORE-II model simulations that have contributed to this study can be found in Danabasoglu et al. (2014) . The ocean model resolution and coupled sea ice model are listed in Table 1 . The models generally have a one-degree horizontal grid spacing, with finer meridional spacing in the tropics. They use between 30 and 63 vertical levels. Exceptions are GFDL-MOM025 that has an eddy permitting resolution of 1/4\u00b0, KIEL05 that has 1/2\u00b0resolution, and ICTP that has a coarser 2\u00b0horizontal resolution. GFDL-MOM025 is based on the ocean-ice component of the CM2.5 coupled climate model documented in Delworth et al. (2012) . With respect to the vertical coordinate, GFDL-GOLD and BERGEN are isopycnal coordinate models, GISS is a mass coordinate model, INMOM is a terrain following \u03c3 -coordinate model, and FSU has a hybrid coordinate configuration, while the other models use a depth coordinate. The CORE-II models, with the exception of GFDL-MOM025, parameterise mesoscale eddies with variants of the Gent and McWilliams (1990) scheme, using either two dimensional (depth independent) or three-dimensional eddy diffusivities. We refer the reader to Table 1 in Farneti et al. (2015) for further details of individual models' eddy parameterisation configuration and how these choices influence mixing and circulation.\nThe models are integrated for five cycles of the 60 year CORE-II 1948-2007 interannually varying forcing from Large and Yeager (2009) . We focus only on results from the last cycle, treating the earlier cycles as a spin-up phase that allows the models to at least partially equilibrate to the surface forcing. A more detailed discussion of the evolution of CORE-II models over the forcing cycles is given by Danabasoglu et al. (2014) and Griffies et al. (2014) . Here we are interested in evaluating model representation of the present climate (average of years [1988] [1989] [1990] [1991] [1992] [1993] [1994] [1995] [1996] [1997] [1998] [1999] [2000] [2001] [2002] [2003] [2004] [2005] [2006] [2007] and diagnosing trends over the same final two decades of cycle 5. We note that a 20-year period is not likely long enough to differentiate between natural and anthropogenic variability, however this is not the focus of our study. Many figures include the average of 15 CORE-II models, denoted as the multi model mean (MMM).\nAs explained in Large and Yeager (2009) , CORE-II atmospheric states have been adjusted to agree in the mean with a variety of satellite and in situ measurements which were considered more reliable than the corresponding NCEP reanalysis data. After these adjustments were made wind speed increased and humidity was reduced, and the wind direction agreed better with the ship based wind climatologies. Furthermore, radiation prior to 1984 and precipitation before 1979 are given as climatological annual cycles. These adjustments improve the CORE-II climatological air-sea heat and freshwater fluxes. Along with the wind stress changes, they produce a closer agreement to the reanalysis and observation-based implied ocean heat transport estimates. Nonetheless, these fluxes are likely not valid over the whole CORE-II 60 year period, given the absence of satellite-based information before 1979. This caveat is especially relevant in the Southern Ocean, which is very sparsely covered criterion. Remaining panels (associated colour scale at bottom of figure): individual models and multi model mean (1988) (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) average) minus observations. Polar grid (black lines) shows latitude (radials; 70\u00b0-40\u00b0S by 10\u00b0) and longitude (rays; clockwise 10\u00b0-350\u00b0E by 20\u00b0). Note: the colour bar in the top row represents the mean states of the observations and multi model mean, whereas the colour bar at the bottom of the figure is for the remaining rows (the biases from observations). The models generally underestimate the summer mixed layer depth in the Southern Ocean, particularly in the mode and intermediate water mass formation regions.\nwith ship and station based observations. In general, the adjusted atmospheric variables were affected in magnitude more than their inherent decadal variability. Hence, any decadal variability in the CORE-II atmospheric state can at best be considered a measure of relative change. We furthermore do not expect that details of the physical drivers prior to incorporation of satellite information are contained in CORE-II atmospheric states.\nDespite using the same CORE-II atmospheric state for deriving air-sea fluxes, simulating an ocean in agreement with observations, particularly in the Southern Ocean, remains challenging. The different sea-ice models and treatment of sea surface salinity restoring (see Appendix C and Table 2 in Danabasoglu et al., 2014) complicate the interpretation of CORE results especially in the Southern Ocean and Arctic. Further, key factors in the forcing are the spatially varying corrections based on mean biases relative to more reliable, but regional and/or short, data sets ). For example, the wind speed and direction corrections are based on QuikSCAT measurements over the open ocean, but there is nothing suitable on which to base any corrections over Antarctic sea ice.\nPassing of the wind stress to the ocean (and differences in applying the wind stress based on relative versus absolute winds) appears to be influenced by the model sea-ice component for the easterlies circling Antarctica. The maximum of the polar easterlies varies by 0.015 Pa and over 5\u00b0in latitude, whereas the maximum strength of the westerly wind stress and the position of that maximum vary over 0.05 Pa with latitudinal spread over 2\u00b0of latitude (see Fig. 3 in Farneti et al. 2015) .\nAlso, corrections to other quantities over the open Southern Ocean are more uncertain than elsewhere due to sparse sampling, especially in winter. The Large and Yeager (2009) forcing corrections assume stationary biases, which are most uncertain in the Southern Ocean. Therefore spurious trends in the forcing and simulations are a possibility. This sampling issue also adds to the uncertainty in ocean mean state and variability derived from observations. Another issue, also present in CORE-I (Griffies et al., 2009) , is the forcing mismatch expected wherever the model sea ice fails to coincide with the observed."}, {"section_title": "Observational-based analysis products", "text": "The observations chosen for model evaluation of the present climate encompass vast amounts of measurements assembled into gridded products using objective interpolation methods. To compare the model potential vorticity, potential temperature, and salinity, we use the World Ocean Atlas 2009 release (WOA09; Locarnini et al., 2010; Antonov et al., 2010) . This climatology (noting a large summer sampling bias) consists of over 9 million profiles sourced from ship, autonomous, pinniped, mooring, and float data collected over recent decades. The quality controlled data are objectively interpolated to 33 standard vertical levels on a 1-degree horizontal grid.\nPotential vorticity is used to define mode waters. Using the individual models' density field, potential vorticity is calculated as:\nwhere f is the Coriolis parameter (negative in the Southern Hemisphere), \u03c1 0 is the mean ocean density as estimated in the individual models, \u03c1 is the potential density referenced to the surface, and z is the geopotential coordinate with zero at the surface of a resting ocean and positive upwards. The sea-ice metrics assessed here are sea-ice concentration and extent. The sea-ice concentration is defined as the area fraction of sea ice (in %) in each (ocean) grid cell, and can vary from 0 to 100%. The sea-ice concentration does not directly depend on the sea-ice thickness. However, grid cells with high ice concentration almost always have a higher ice thickness than grid cells with low ice concentration, and as a result, thickness and concentration correlate positively. The observed sea-ice concentration is based on the NOAA Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature V2 data (NOAA OI.v2 SST; Reynolds et al., 2002) . The modelled sea-ice concentration was interpolated from model native grids to a common, regular 1\u00b0\u00d7 1\u00b0grid using a bilinear method to enable the computation of departures of modelled sea-ice concentration from the observed NOAA OI.v2 SST sea-ice concentration. An exception is in Fig. 27 , where we use the Nimbus-5 Electrically Scanning Microwave Radiometer (ESMR) gridded sea-ice concentration September average from 1973 to 1976 (Parkinson et al., 2004; Zwally et al., 1983) . The modelled sea-ice extent is estimated as the sum of the grid cell area where the modelled sea-ice concentration is higher than 15%. The observed sea-ice extent is based on the sea-ice index available from the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC, Fetterer et al. 2009 )."}, {"section_title": "Correlation calculation", "text": "We are interested in whether the spatial distribution of the large mixed layer depths associated with mode and intermediate waters is influenced by sea ice, surface buoyancy fluxes, and wind stress. For example, do regions where the mixed layers are deepest show a positive correlation with regions where there is greater heat loss to the atmosphere, or correlate with the same longitude bands where the sea ice extends furthest equatorward? We base our analysis on computing correlations between the mixed layer depth and surface winds, buoyancy and sea ice. We identify in how many of the CORE-II models these correlations are significant, and note whether there is uniform agreement in the sign of the correlations across the models.\nWe define the area spanning grid cells where the March mixed layer depth is greater than 50 m or where the September mixed layer depth is greater than 300 m. The area where the mixed layer depth is greater than 50 m/300 m is summed meridionally over the 65\u00b0S-45\u00b0S latitude band (within which the mixed layer depths associated with mode and intermediate water masses are located). We then bin the mixed layer depth area metric in 10\u00b0longitude intervals (given that we are assessing large-scale features), and either average over the 20 years for the mean state, or estimate a linear trend over the 20-year period. The result is a vector, M i , where i = 1 : 36. Regions where M i is zero (i.e. when the March mixed layer depth is less than 50 m or the September mixed layer depth is less than 300 m) are excluded from the correlation analyses. The mixed layer depth vector M i is correlated with another index, S i , representative of either the latitudinal location of the sea-ice edge, the maximum wind stress and associated position, or surface heat and freshwater fluxes. Remaining panels (associated colour scale at bottom of figure): model difference from observations, where blue shades denote model temperature is cooler than observed, reds for warmer than observed. The solid black contour is the model 6\u00b0C isotherm, and dashed is the observed 6\u00b0C isotherm. Note: the colour bar in the top row represents the mean states of the observations and multi model mean, whereas the colour bar at the bottom of the figure is for the remaining rows (the biases from observations). The MMM generally shows a cool bias south of 50\u00b0S and a warm bias to the north. The temperature bias renders a rough density compensating bias with the salinity bias shown in Fig. 4 . (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\nThe annual mean heat and freshwater fluxes are interpolated to 1\u00b0l ongitude bins, and integrated meridionally between 65\u00b0S and 45\u00b0S into 10\u00b0bins. We note that in this latitude range, the freshwater flux is dominantly into the ocean, however there are regions of both heat loss and gain. Thus we separate the regions of heat gain and heat loss, that is, we integrate where the heat flux is positive (heat gain) and negative (heat loss) across the Southern Ocean in the 65\u00b0S-45\u00b0S latitude range. We then take the time mean or linear trend over the 20-year period.\nFor the wind stress, we are interested in both the maximum strength of the westerlies and the position of this maximum for each 10\u00b0bin. The CORE-II models' wind stress maximum is 0.16 Pa, with latitudinal position ranging between 55\u00b0S and 50\u00b0S (see Farneti et al. 2015 for further discussion on wind stress in CORE-II models). We use the annual mean wind stress for estimating the wind stress maximum and its latitudinal position, and then take the time mean or linear trend over the 20-year period.\nThe sea-ice edge does not necessarily reach the 65\u00b0S-45\u00b0S latitude range for all longitudes during March and September. However, sea ice can influence buoyancy fluxes, and thus indirectly influence the mixed layer depth. We define the sea ice edge index as the latitudinal location of the northernmost grid cell where the sea-ice concentration is over 15% for each 10\u00b0longitude bin for March and September in each of the 20 years (1988) (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) . We then take the time mean or linear trend over the 20-year period."}, {"section_title": "Evaluation of the climate over years 1988-2007", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "March and September mixed layer depth", "text": "Here we evaluate the mixed layer annual cycle by assessing the 2 months that generally represent the minimum and maximum mixed layer depths, namely March and September. The 1988-2007 multi model mean March mixed layer depth is overall shallower than observed by approximately 50 m (Fig. 1) , a result similarly shown in a recent study assessing 21 coupled climate models (Sall\u00e9e et al., 2013a) . However, the model mean features some small regions of deep mixed layer biases that are strongly influenced by few models. For example, the local deep (positive) mixed layer bias in the Indian sector is weighted heavily by biases found in the BERGEN, GISS, ICTP, KIEL05, and NOCS models.\nWe pay particular attention to the September mixed layer depth biases (Fig. 2) . The irreversible subduction of upper ocean water masses into the ocean interior, occurring shortly after the deep winter mixed layers begin to shoal in spring, is highly dependent on the late winter mixed layer depth (e.g., Marshall et al., 1993) . The deepest mode and intermediate water mass mixed layers are found in the southeast Indian and Pacific basins (Dong et al., 2008; Herraiz-Borreguero and Rintoul, 2011) . The models simulate deeper than observed mode and intermediate water mixed layer depths, positioned further south than observed (Fig. 2) . Unlike with the March mixed layer biases, the September mixed layer biases vary in sign and spatial distribution. The differing mixed layer biases across the models is associated with differences in, for example, the individual models' interior temperature and salinity field, mixing schemes, grid resolution, and surface heat and freshwater fluxes. Whilst evaluating all these types of differences is beyond the scope of this paper, we can comment on the large variation in the models' surface heat fluxes (Fig. 3) and ocean interior temperature and salinity (Figs. 4-7 ).\nThe models with widespread deeper mixed layer depths are ACCESS, BERGEN, FSU, and ICTP. In these four models, the region of Southern Ocean surface heat loss extends further equatorward (Fig. 3) , and there are larger upper ocean saline biases at high latitudes that dominate the model mean bias (Figs. 4 and 5) . Dong et al. (2008) noted that mode water mixed layers in the southeastern Pacific basin are preconditioned by the relatively strong cooling and weak stratification from upwelling. The CORE-II models with a shallower than observed mixed layer depth in the southeast Pacific 60\u00b0S-50\u00b0S latitude band (AWI, CMCC, MOM025, GISS, INMOM, KIEL05, and NCAR) have warmer and fresher near surface waters around 45\u00b0S (Figs. 4 and 6 ).\nSeveral models (ACCESS, BERGEN, FSU, GFDL-GOLD, GFDL-MOM, GISS, ICTP, INMOM, and MRI) have a significantly deeper mixed layer bias in one of the major Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) formation regions in the Weddell Sea, associated with cold deep ocean biases at high latitudes (Figs. 6 and 7). The FSU, GISS and INMOM models in particular have substantial surface heat loss south of 60\u00b0S (Fig. 3 ) that are associated with these polar ocean interior cold biases.\nSouth of 50\u00b0S, most models simulate slightly deeper isopycnals than observed (Fig. 8) . The largest differences exist near the Antarctic continental margin at potential densities (referenced to 2 km) greater than 1036.8 kg m \u22123 . In particular, the BERGEN, CMCC, ICTP, KIEL05 and NOCS models simulate substantially lighter waters than observed along the continental margin, which may be associated with fresh surface water biases south of 60\u00b0S (Fig. 4) that extend to the ocean floor and are strongest in the Pacific sector (Fig. 5) . We hypothesise that the CORE-II atmospheric state across the 15 models influences the coherent upper 2 km cool/fresh biases south of 50\u00b0S, and the warm/saline biases to the north."}, {"section_title": "Correlations of MLD to boundary forcing", "text": "To assess the likely influence of the spatial pattern of overlying wind stress, surface buoyancy fluxes and sea-ice forcing on the mixed layer depth, we defined an area index as the area where the March and September mixed layer depths exceeded 50 m and 300 m, respectively, restricted to the upper ocean water mass formation zones (65\u00b0S-45\u00b0S). We then correlated this index of deep mixed layer depth with the latitudinal location of high sea ice concentration, heat and freshwater fluxes (integrated over the meridional range of 65\u00b0S-45\u00b0S), as well as the latitudinal position and strength of the surface westerly wind stress maximum (Fig. 9) . Using the methodology described in Section 2.3, we diagnose the relationships between mixed layer depths and surface forcing and sea ice. Each symbol (circle or star) in Fig. 9 represents the spatial correlation of 36 value pairs ((M i , S i ); i = 1:36). Our focus is on correlations that are significant at the 90% level in more than half the assessed CORE-II models (represented by the stars in Fig. 9 ).\nThe axes labels for buoyancy fluxes/winds/sea ice denote the mean state of the variable in association with the mean state of the mixed layer depth area, if the correlation is positive. For example, an area of deeper March mixed layer depth is positively correlated with where the westerly wind stress maxima is positioned further equatorward. Similarly, an area of shallower March mixed layer depth is positively correlated with where the westerly wind stress maxima is positioned further poleward. Conversely, areas of deeper March mixed layer depth are primarily negatively correlated with regions of larger surface heat gain.\nThe summer (i.e., March) mixed layer depth forms when increased buoyancy input (from surface heating and ice melt increasing surface freshening) strengthens stratification. The correlation in Fig. 9 (upper panel) use an area index for where the March mixed layer depth is greater than 50 m. The March mixed layer depth is shallower than observed (Fig. 1) . We find that models whose March mixed layer depth area index is smallest have a more poleward positioned, but weaker wind stress maximum, larger surface heat gain, and sea ice positioned closer to the Antarctic continent (this would increase surface freshwater). The wind stress strength and position (see Fig.  3a in Farneti et al., 2015) and the shallow March mixed layer biases are coherent across the CORE-II models (Fig. 1) . However there is more pronounced variation between the surface heat fluxes (Fig. 3) and sea-ice extent (Section 3.5).\nWhilst the March mixed layer across the CORE-II models displays a uniform shallow bias compared to observation, the sign of the bias is not in agreement across the models for the September mixed layer depth (Fig. 2) . Similarly to the disagreement in the sign of the mixed layer bias across the models, the correlations for where the September mixed layer exceeds 300 m are not in agreement in sign ( Fig. 9 ; lower panel). The deep mixed layers associated with mode and intermediate water mass formation (i.e., in the 65\u00b0-45\u00b0S latitude band) form via surface heat loss associated with strong westerlies driving cool polar waters equatorward into the formation zones. Unlike with the March mixed layer depth ( Fig. 9; upper panel) , there is disagreement in the sign and significance of the correlation between the September mixed layer depth and wind stress. Rather, the deeper September mixed layer depth is significantly correlated with the surface buoyancy forcing and a more poleward positioned September sea-ice edge.\nTo interpret the discrepancy in sign for the September mixed layer correlations, we cluster the CORE-II models into four groups. The first [1988] [1989] [1990] [1991] [1992] [1993] [1994] [1995] [1996] [1997] [1998] [1999] [2000] [2001] [2002] [2003] [2004] [2005] [2006] [2007] describing the relationship between the March (top) and September (bottom) mixed layer depth regions exceeding 50 m and 300 m, and the westerly wind stress (\u03c4 x ) position (red), westerly wind stress strength (blue), freshwater flux into the ocean (green), heat gain to the ocean (magenta; the integral over positive heat fluxes), heat loss to the ocean (cyan; the integral over negative heat fluxes), March sea-ice edge (black), and September sea-ice edge (red). Each symbol represents one of the 15 CORE-II models. Solid symbols represent a correlation significant at the 90% level; open symbols are insignificant correlations. Stars represent relationships where more than half the CORE-II models indicated a significant relationship; circles represent cases where less than half the models indicated a significant relationship. See the text for interpretation of the sign of the correlations. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) group (MRI, GFDL-MOM025, and INMOM models) shows insignificant correlations between the deep mixed layer depth areas and winds, buoyancy fluxes and sea ice. The second group (KIEL05 only) indicates that areas where the September mixed layer depth exceeds 300 m are significantly correlated with larger westerly wind strength maxima, with where the maxima (and sea ice) are positioned further equatorward, and with where there is large freshwater input and heat fluxes (both heat gain and loss). The third group (ACCESS, BERGEN, CMCC, GFDL-GOLD, GISS, ICTP) overall shows the opposite relationship with area where the mixed layers are deep. Uotila et al. (2014) similarly showed that in the ACCESS model, ice moves fast northward and then melts, and therefore results in a large freshwater flux between 50\u00b0S and 60\u00b0S (see their Fig. 6d) . Finally, the remaining models (AWI, FSU, GFDL-MOM, NCAR, and ORCA-NOCS) do not exhibit similarities between the signs of the correlations across the diagnostics assessed.\nWe also assessed the correlation between winds, buoyancy fluxes and sea ice to identify causal relationships between factors influencing mixed layer depth (Fig. 10) . For example, sea ice is positioned south of the mode and intermediate water mass formation regions, however it has a strong influence on the buoyancy fluxes that are driven equatorward into the formation regions in the Ekman layer. For the CORE-II models, stronger westerly wind stress maxima and a more equatorward positioned wind stress maximum are associated with larger buoyancy fluxes, and a more northward sea ice position. A more northward sea ice position in both March and September is significantly correlated with more freshwater input and larger heat fluxes (both heat loss and gain), likely meaning that regions where sea ice extends further equatorward inhibit polar evaporative processes and influence heat flux exchange at the ocean-atmosphere and ocean-sea ice interfaces. We note that the seasonality of the sea ice position is significantly correlated, meaning that regions of more equatorward March sea ice position are similar to those in September.\nThe intricate link between surface mechanical and buoyancy forcing reflects the extreme climate of the Southern Ocean, and indicates the high degree of complexity associated with understanding how upper ocean processes impact on the Southern Ocean mean state and trends. We conjecture that the coherent March shallow mixed layer depth biases are likely due to the commonly applied CORE-II atmospheric state (in particular, wind stress), whereas individual model ocean parameterisations, surface buoyancy fluxes, and sea ice appear to be more influential in the representation of the September mixed layer depth. We note that mesoscale parameterisations are not correlated with mixed layer depth properties and that other factors discussed above likely dominate (see also discussion in Farneti et al., 2015) ."}, {"section_title": "Water mass properties", "text": "We now evaluate the models' representation of the temperature and salinity properties associated with water masses forming in deep mixed layer depth regions, namely Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) and Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW). In Section 3.4 we discuss how these water masses interact with those adjacent in the water column.\nThe most widely used observational constraint to identify SAMW is a thick homogenous layer of low potential vorticity (e.g., Hanawa and Talley, 2001; Hartin et al., 2011; Herraiz-Borreguero and Rintoul, 2011; Cerovefl cki et al., 2013) . This low potential vorticity layer is indicative of deep mixed layers in which mode waters form, and can be identified across most of the Southern Ocean around 40\u00b0S (see for example Fig. 2 in Herraiz-Borreguero and Rintoul, 2011). Here we are interested in the model representation of the low potential vorticity layer across the Southern Ocean (Figs. 11 and 12) . Overall, the CORE-II models compare well with observations (WOA09) in terms of depth and magnitude of the low potential vorticity cell in the Indian Ocean. However, few are able to simulate the very weak stratification of the SAMW cell in the Pacific basin. Only NCAR and NOCS simulate a low potential vorticity cell of similar magnitude and around 500 m thick in the Pacific. ACCESS, BERGEN, FSU, GFDL-MOM, ICTP, and KIEL05 represent a potential vorticity minimum with similar magnitude to observed, but with a deeper extending low potential vorticity layer. Sloyan and Kamenkovich (2007) found that eight coarse resolution Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 models have a thinner and less defined low potential vorticity layer associated with mode water in the Pacific basin (see their Fig. 8) . Here, the poor representation of the low potential vorticity layer in the Pacific basin is reflected in the shallow mixed layer biases south of this region in Fig. 2 , whereas the lower than observed potential vorticity in the Indian sector corresponds with deep winter mixed layer biases south of 40\u00b0S.\nAAIW, mostly forming south of SAMW, is identified by a salinity minimum (see the 34.4 contour in the upper left panel of Fig. 4 ) that extends below 1000 m (e.g. Hanawa and Talley, 2001 ). This distinct salinity minimum is produced by freshwater input (precipitation) in the intermediate water formation regions that is subducted into the ocean interior at densities similar to and denser than mode waters (cf., Hartin et al., 2011; Sloyan and Kamenkovich, 2007) . Overall, the modelled salinity minimum is fresher than observed and does not extend as far into the ocean as found in observations. The overly fresh salinity minimum in models may in part be due to less than observed sea ice, particularly in March (see Section 3.5). Namely, the low sea ice, and associated low levels of brine rejection, allows for more open ocean areas whereby precipitation biases the salinity low. The salinity minimum is displaced poleward and/or does not extend deep enough into the ocean interior in the ACCESS, BERGEN, GFDL-GOLD, GFDL-MOM, GFDL-MOM025, ICTP and INMOM models. Models that adequately represent the salinity minimum associated with intermediate water are BERGEN, KIEL05, MRI, NCAR and NOCS.\nWe compared the zonally averaged density structure across the CORE-II models, finding a favourable agreement between the multi model mean and observations (Fig. 8) . However, the CORE-II models are biased warm north of 50\u00b0S, with the exceptions being the GFDL-GOLD and GISS models (see 6\u00b0C isotherms in Fig. 6 ). The overall favourable agreement in the density structure of the CORE-II models is due to counteracting warm and salty biases north of \u223c50\u00b0S and the cool and fresh biases to the south (Figs. 4 and 6 ). These Southern Ocean temperature and salinity bias patterns centred around 50\u00b0S are restricted to the upper 2 km; for deeper regions, the models show an overall cold and fresh bias across all latitudes (Figs. 5 and 7) ."}, {"section_title": "Water mass formation processes", "text": "Here we describe the water mass budget for the CORE-II models in the region south of 30\u00b0S, using methods stemming from Walin (1982) , and subsequently applied in several multi-model analyses (cf., Downes et al., 2011; Sall\u00e9e et al., 2013b) . The rate of change in the volume of a density layer (summed zonally) from its high latitude outcrop to 30\u00b0S is a balance between three components, namely (1) the lateral diapycnal flux across its outcrop arising from heat and freshwater fluxes at the ocean-atmosphere and ocean-sea ice interfaces, (2) the transport across the 30\u00b0S boundary, and (3) the diapycnal fluxes arising from interior mixing (see for example Fig. 2 and associated equations in Downes et al., 2011 ). Here we concentrate on the first two components, which we term as the water mass transformation rates by surface buoyancy fluxes, and the volume transport across 30\u00b0S. The northward volume transport across 30\u00b0S (i.e., the export of volume from a density layer from the Southern Ocean), averaged over years [1988] [1989] [1990] [1991] [1992] [1993] [1994] [1995] [1996] [1997] [1998] [1999] [2000] [2001] [2002] [2003] [2004] [2005] [2006] [2007] , is illustrated by the grey bars in Fig. 13 . Water mass layers are defined by the direction of transport; thermocline waters (TW) and deep waters (DW) are imported from northern origins, whereas mode/intermediate waters (MW) and bottom waters (BW) form in the Southern Ocean and are exported equatorward. Thus the volume and densities bounding these water mass layers are different for each model. As has been shown in previous studies that evaluate coarse resolution climate models (e.g., Gnanadesikan et al., 2004; Downes et al., 2011; Sall\u00e9e et al., 2013b) , the CORE-II models exhibit a stronger upper, and weaker lower, overturning circulation at 30\u00b0S compared with observationally based estimates (grey bars versus white bars in Fig. 13) . Talley (2008) (white bars in Fig. 13 ) concludes that the majority of the deep waters of northern origin flowing southward into the Southern Ocean return equatorwards as bottom waters. On the other hand, the models indicate that the majority of the incoming deep waters upwell and contribute to lighter mode and intermediate waters. The isopycnal coordinate model, GFDL-GOLD, best represents the lower cell volume transports across 30\u00b0S among the CORE-II models. The GFDL-MOM025, ICTP, KIEL05, and MRI models have particularly small bottom water export.\nThe tendency for strong upper ocean overturning and weak lower overturning transports in CORE-II models relative to observations cannot simply be attributed to biases in the atmospheric forcing. Firstly, these common volume transport biases have been depicted in past studies as mentioned above, which include fully coupled climate models and assimilated solutions. Secondly the observations may miss key downwelling and entrainment processes in the AABW layer associated with sea ice. These observations are estimated from inverse methods and sparse Southern Ocean observations, with no sea-ice processes represented. Additionally, models likely misrepresent small-scale mixing process, for example, associated with the entrainment of deep waters into the bottom water layer.\nThe surface water mass transformation is influenced by sea ice, buoyancy and air-sea and ice-sea stress that combine to alter the surface density. The transformation rate for a density layer, \u03c1 k (bound by \u03c1 k and \u03c1 k+1 ) fluctuates widely over the seasonal cycle, and thus we use monthly fields for the calculation. The surface transformation is an integration over the entire outcrop region, and is estimated as (following Downes et al., 2011) :\nwhere the first term represents the transformation due to the net heat flux into the ocean (Q net ) and its associated thermal expansion and heat capacity coefficients (\u03b1 and C p , respectively). The second term represents the net contribution from the freshwater flux into the ocean (FW net ), including precipitation, evaporation, run-off and sea ice melt (where available), and associated haline contraction coefficient (\u03b2), surface salinity (S), and reference ocean density (\u03c1 0 = 1035 kg m \u22123 ). We choose density referenced to 2000 dbar as we are assessing water mass transformation over the entire water column. Previous Southern Ocean model water mass transformation studies have used a variety of density coordinates, including density referenced to the surface or 2000 dbar or neutral density (e.g., Marsh et al., 2000; Downes et al., 2011; Cerove\u010dki et al., 2013; Sall\u00e9e et al., 2013b) . We conjecture that our choice of density coordinate will not qualitatively impact identification of the dominant buoyancy fluxes influencing the surface transformation. ). The black curve used as an example here is the multi model mean total water mass transformation due to buoyancy fluxes at the ocean-atmosphere interface, also shown in Fig. 15 . The red and blue curves are the surface water mass transformation due to heat and freshwater fluxes, respectively, as defined in Eq. (2). Positive WMT implies conversion of water masses from lower to higher density classes, and that the overlying buoyancy loss is a result of cooling or evaporative processes. Conversely, negative WMT implies water mass conversion to lower density classes, and a buoyancy gain due to warming and freshening at the surface. Formation in a water mass layer is indicated when WMT\u03c3 k -WMT\u03c3 k+1 > 0 (where \u03c3 here refers to potential density referenced to 2000 dbar, i.e., \u03c3 2 ), and the discrete label k represents density layers with k increasing downwards. A negative difference implies destruction of the water mass as it is mixed into adjacent density layers. Note that the formation diagnostic assumes waters are stably stratified with respect to \u03c3 2 , so that \u03c3 k+1 > \u03c3 k . The water mass layers (TW, MW, DW and BW) are those used in Fig. 13 , and the associated density classes are defined here by the points of inflection in the total surface WMT black curve. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\nWe compare the transformation at the ocean-atmosphere and ocean-sea ice interfaces, arising from surface heat and freshwater fluxes. In Fig. 14, we show the resultant multi model mean (MMM) transformation curves for heat, freshwater and their sum, as well as an interpretative guide to water mass transformation (WMT) diagrams in density space. Positive WMT implies conversion of water masses from lower to higher density classes, with the buoyancy loss resulting from overlying cooling and/or evaporative processes. Conversely, negative WMT implies water mass conversion to lower density classes, and a buoyancy gain due to warming and/or freshening at the surface. Formation in a water mass layer occurs when WMT \u03c3 k -WMT \u03c3 k+1 > 0 (where \u03c3 here refers to potential density referenced to 2000 dbar, i.e., \u03c3 2 ), and the discrete label k labels density layers with k increasing downwards. A negative difference implies destruction of the water mass as it is mixed into adjacent density layers. Note that the formation diagnostic assumes waters are stably stratified with respect to \u03c3 2 , so that \u03c3 k+1 > \u03c3 k . Fig. 15 the MMM shows and individual model water mass transformation from the CORE-II models. Across all models, the water mass transformation at the ocean surface is coherently dominated by heat fluxes north of \u223c45\u00b0S (red curves) that coincides with the zonally averaged outcrop latitude for \u03c3 2 \u223c 1035 kg m \u22123 ; a net heat gain in the tropics (negative transformation rate) and heat loss in the subtropics. Cooling and freshening (the latter dominating) contribute to the surface transformation in the CORE-II models between 1035 kg m \u22123 and 1037 kg m \u22123 . In this density range, the net surface transformation (black curves) migrates from a region of buoyancy loss to gain, corresponding to the formation of mode waters via the destruction of intermediate waters. We note that the two models with the strongest water mass transformation due to heat loss at the ocean surface in the \u03c3 2 = 1036.5-1037 kg m \u22123 range (FSU and ICTP) also exhibit the deepest September mixed layer biases (Fig. 2) . Upwelled deep waters (\u03c3 2 = 1036.5-1037 kg m \u22123 ) are destroyed through freshening and converted to lighter intermediate waters, and denser bottom waters. The formation of bottom waters (\u03c3 2 > 1037 kg m \u22123 ) is via both cooling and brine rejection at the surface.\nThe combination of heat and freshwater fluxes driving Southern Ocean water mass transformation has previously been identified using both reanalyses products and models (e.g., Speer et al., 2000; Downes et al., 2011; Sall\u00e9e et al., 2013b) . In particular, Downes et al. (2011) showed very similar surface formation rates for three fully coupled models with similar ocean-ice configurations, whereas Sall\u00e9e et al. (2013b) showed that 21 different fully coupled models varied considerably in their formation rates. In the present study, the magnitude of formation rates varies considerably across the CORE-II models. For example, the formation of mode waters (taken as the difference between the maximum transformation near \u03c3 2 = 1034.5 kg m \u22123 and the minimum near \u03c3 2 \u223c= 1036 kg m \u22123 ) varies by more than approximately 10 Sv across the 13 illustrated models. The transformation differences between the CORE-II models imply that the different ocean model configurations, in particular their density field and mixing parameterisations, are more likely to influence the surface water mass transformation over the whole water column than the common Large and Yeager (2009) atmospheric state."}, {"section_title": "Sea-ice properties", "text": "The Antarctic sea ice can significantly influence water mass formation throughout the water column via changes in upper ocean buoyancy driven by sea-ice melting and freezing. Here we evaluate the representation of the ice concentration and extent in comparison with satellite-based observations where available. Sea-ice extent box plots in March and September from 1988 to 2007 are shown in Fig. 16 . In March, all models have, on average, lower sea-ice extent than observed (the MMM is 4.4 \u00d7 10 6 km 2 ; Fig. 16 lower panel) , with GFDL-MOM025 having the closest to observed mean sea-ice extent of 4.1 \u00d7 10 6 km 2 , then NOCS of 2.7 \u00d7 10 6 km 2 , and finally GISS having the lowest mean sea-ice extent of 0.9 \u00d7 10 6 km 2 . In September, the modelled sea-ice extent ranges from 13-24 \u00d7 10 6 km 2 , with FSU having the least amount of ice, on the average 16.4 \u00d7 10 6 km 2 from 1988-2007, and GFDL-MOM025 having the largest average ice extent of 22.9 \u00d7 10 6 km 2 , while the observed mean is 18.8 \u00d7 10 6 km 2 . Modelled September sea-ice extent is spread relatively evenly around the observed sea-ice extent. Nine models (ACCESS, CMCC, GFDL-GOLD, GFDL-MOM, GFDL-MOM025, GISS, ICTP, KIEL05 and NOCS) have higher sea-ice extent than the observed, while six models (AWI, BERGEN, FSU, INMOM, NCAR and MRI) have a lower sea-ice extent than the observed. All models, except FSU, GFDL-MOM025, GISS and NOCS, have the mean September sea-ice extent relatively close to the observed ranging from 18.0 to 19.6 \u00d7 10 6 km 2 .\nThe modelled sea-ice appears less realistic in March than in September. The expansion of sea ice in austral autumn is driven by large-scale atmospheric circulation and thermodynamic processes which are relatively well captured by the CORE-II forcing and oceanice models. The summer minimum sea-ice extent, on the other hand, is likely to be controlled by smaller scale processes which are less realistically represented in the forcing, such as the oceanic heat flux, topographically guided atmospheric flow and storms, and the portion of shortwave radiation penetrating the ice (dependent on different parameterisations and albedo values) (cf., St\u00f6ssel et al., 2011) . Such summertime processes may require both high resolution ocean models and a higher resolution wind forcing that incorporates the effects of katabatic winds at the Antarctic continental margin (Barth\u00e9lemy et al., 2012; Mathiot et al., 2010; St\u00f6ssel et al., 2011) .\nThe observed sea-ice concentration based on NOAA OI.v2 SST data set for March is shown in the first panel of Fig. 17 , and the deviations of modelled sea-ice concentration from the observed are shown in the remaining panels. The sea-ice concentration is high in the western Weddell Sea where sea ice remains thick in summer, and where models show lower ice concentrations than observed indicating that the modelled sea ice is too thin in the area. AWI has the smallest seaice concentration biases, while, for example FSU, along with GFDL-GOLD, GISS, and MRI, show large negative biases in the western Weddell Sea, in the Bellingshausen and Amundsen Seas, and in the Ross Sea. GFDL-MOM, and GFDL-MOM025 models have particularly high positive biases in the eastern Weddell Sea and Ross Sea regions.\nIn September, sea-ice extends much further north than in March and many models show high positive or negative biases in concentration at the northern boundary of sea ice related to the unrealistic position of the sea-ice edge (Fig. 18 ). Many models simulate sea-ice extending too far north in the Australian sector (approximately from 90\u00b0E to 150\u00b0E), apparent as positive sea-ice concentration biases along 60\u00b0S. Exceptions are INMOM, KIEL05 and MRI, which display very small departures from the observed. This discrepancy between the observed and modelled sea-ice concentration across many models implies that the September sea-ice concentration biases are related to the common atmospheric forcing, possibly the large scale wind transport that is important for the advection of sea ice in autumn.\nElsewhere, such as in the northern Weddell Sea, negative concentration biases are common (see for example ACCESS, GFDL-GOLD, GFDL-MOM, INMOM, and MRI in Fig.18 ) indicating that there too little sea ice is advected northward. GFDL-MOM025 displays positive sea-ice concentration biases practically everywhere contributing to its high sea-ice extent. Biases such as these vary from model to model and are likely to be due to the ability of an individual model to simulate sea-ice thermodynamics, ocean-ice exchange processes and ocean currents. Whilst the March sea-ice concentration negative bias patterns are similar across the CORE-II models, the September regional biases vary in sign and magnitude between models.\nThe location of the sea-ice edge can be characterised by the latitudinal location of the northernmost grid cell around Antarctica where the sea-ice concentration is greater than 15%. Statistics of the sea-ice edge (mean latitude and standard deviation from 1988 to 2007) are shown in Figs. 19 and 20 . In March, the modelled sea-ice edge is mostly too far south, except in GFDL-MOM025, particularly in the Ross Sea and in the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Sea (170\u00b0E to 300\u00b0E). In the Weddell Sea, the inter-model variability is large, with, for example, the location of the sea-ice edge varying from 73\u00b0S (MRI and FSU) to 65\u00b0S (GFDL-MOM025, NCAR and KIEL05) at 340\u00b0E (Fig. 19) .\nIn September, the location of the modelled sea-ice edge follows relatively closely to observations, except being too northward around the East Antarctic and the Ross Sea, from 90\u00b0E to 180\u00b0E ( Fig. 19 ; see also Fig. 18 ). In the Amundsen Sea, from 210\u00b0E to 280\u00b0E, the intermodel variability is high with the southernmost mean sea-ice edge simulated by FSU and the northernmost sea-ice edge simulated by GFDL-MOM025. In the Weddell Sea, between 310\u00b0E and 20\u00b0E, the modelled sea-ice edge remains too far south, on the average, which is consistent with Fig. 18 .\nModelled interannual variability, in terms of standard deviation of the location of sea-ice edge appears to be in good agreement with the observed variability. In March, the modelled variability in terms of multi-model mean follows closely the observed in the Ross Sea and in the Amundsen Sea, but shows too high variability in the Bellingshausen Sea and in the western Weddell Sea. In September, FSU shows too high variability in the Weddell Sea and in the Ross Sea (Fig. 20) , and the sea-ice edge of INMOM has a very high interannual variability at the Antarctic Peninsula, 300\u00b0E. In general, the modelled and observed variability is particularly high in the Ross Sea and in the Bellingshausen Sea, where the interannual variability of the large-scale atmospheric circulation modes, such as Southern Annular Mode (SAM), El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Zonal Wave 3 (ZW3) results in variability of cyclonicity and further in variability of sea ice (Pezza et al., 2012) ."}, {"section_title": "Evaluation of 20 year trends (1988-2007)", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Mixed layer depth trends", "text": "The linear trends over years [1988] [1989] [1990] [1991] [1992] [1993] [1994] [1995] [1996] [1997] [1998] [1999] [2000] [2001] [2002] [2003] [2004] [2005] [2006] [2007] in the modelled mixed layer depth are shown in Figs. 21 and 22. There is no record of observed multi-decadal mixed layer depth trends to use for comparison with the modelled trends presented here. However, over the last decade, Sall\u00e9e et al. (2010b) showed that the response of the mixed layer depth is zonally asymmetric, as demonstrated here over a 20 year period. In addition, CMIP5 coupled climate models overall project 21st century trends that are the same sign as the trends modelled here (Sall\u00e9e et al., 2013a, see their Fig. 10) . We find that the CORE-II models simulate a coherent spatial pattern for the mixed layer trends, indicating that the CORE-II forcing strongly influences the temporal variation in both the summer and winter mixed layer depths.\nFor the 20 year mean period, the regions of deepest mixed layers are in the southeast Pacific and southeast Indian basins (Figs. 1 and 2 ). Over the 20 year period, the March mixed layer depth increases in the southeast Pacific, and decreases in the southeast Indian, with a magnitude of approximately \u00b1 3 m year \u22121 (Fig. 21) . The strongest March trends are found in the BERGEN, GFDL-GOLD, KIEL05 and NOCS models in particular, with weaker changes in the ACCESS, AWI, GFDL-MOM, GFDL-MOM025 and ICTP models. These mixed layer depth trends are unlikely associated with trends in upper ocean temperature (Fig. 23) , given that the temperature is warming in the southeast Pacific where the March mixed layer has deepened, and vice versa for the southeast Indian basin. The increases in the southeast Pacific March mixed layer depth is more likely associated with increased sea ice extent (Fig. 24) , and thus increased brine rejection.\nThe CORE-II models vary in the magnitude of their September mixed layer depth trends (Fig. 22) , however the sign and spatial pattern of these trends across the Southern Ocean is similar. The most striking mixed layer trend is in the Pacific basin, where September mixed layers decrease in the southeast region, and increase in the southwest region (latitude range 60\u00b0S-50\u00b0S). The simulated decreases in September mixed layer depth in the southeast Pacific region are associated with upper ocean warming, and increases in the mixed layer depth in the southwest Pacific with upper ocean cooling (see Fig. 23 ). Decreasing September mixed layer depth in the Indian The region of decreasing September mixed layer depths in the southeast Pacific is adjacent to one of increasing to the south, implying a possible shift in the deep mixed layer regions. The increases in the September mixed layer depth south of 60\u00b0S is likely associated with sea ice changes. The September sea ice retreats poleward by approximately 0.02\u00b0of latitude per year (Fig. 24) , providing a larger domain for surface buoyancy fluxes and wind stress to influence the winter southeast Pacific mixed layer depths. Models simulating the largest increases in the September polar mixed layer depth (FSU, the three GFDL models, ICTP and INMOM) also exhibited the deepest mixed layer biases compared to observations for the 20 year averaged period (Fig. 2) .\nUsing the methodology described in Section 2.3, we correlated the 20 year trends of the areas where the mixed layer depth exceeds 50 m (March)/300 m (September) with surface forcing and sea ice (Fig. 25) . Overall, we found that the trend in the mixed layer depths is not uniformly correlated (in terms of sign) with the spatial distribution of external forcing trends across the CORE-II models. We found that the deepening of the September mixed layer depth (i.e., increase of the mixed layer area greater than 300 m) is significantly correlated with changes in surface heat loss in more than half the CORE-II models, however the sign of these correlations was not coherent across the models. In addition, we were not able to coherently cluster the models into the sign of their correlations.\nChanges in wind stress strength and position were significantly correlated with changes in the mixed layer depth in few models. Wind changes are best interpreted through the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), which is the principal mode of variability in the Southern Hemisphere extratropical atmospheric circulation, and computed as the difference in normalised zonal mean sea level pressure at 40\u00b0S and 65\u00b0S (Marshall, 2003) . The SAM has a zonally symmetric or annual structure, with synchronous anomalies of opposite signs in Antarctica and the midlatitudes. Over the past 60 years, a clear upward trend in the SAM index has been observed, and is well represented in the CORE-II forcings (Fig. 26) . The SAM is believed to drive and influence the large-scale variability of both mean and eddy flows in the Southern Ocean, and a detailed investigation of its effect on the CORE-II models is given in Farneti et al. (2015) . A positive SAM index means that sea-level pressure over Antarctica is relatively low compared to the midlatitudes. A positive trend in the SAM index (1988) (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) in the March (upper panel) and September (lower panel) latitudinal location of the northernmost grid cell, where the sea-ice concentration is over 15% for each 10\u00b0longitude bin. MMM is the multi model mean (black dashed curves). Observations are the NOAA OI.v2 SST product (black solid curves). Overall the observed sea-ice margin has extended northward over the past 20 years, though the models exhibit a smaller or negative (retreating) trend in sea ice.\n(increasing strength of westerlies) was sustained until the 1980s, at which point the trend diminished with the index remaining in a positive state. Hence, although winds have been shown to strengthen and shift polewards across the entire Southern Ocean over the past 60 years, the trend has weakened considerably from the 1990s onwards.\nSince the trend analysis presented here covers the 1988-2007 period, the reduction in strengthening of westerly winds over the same period might partly explain the absence of a coherent significant correlation with mixed layer trends across the CORE-II models."}, {"section_title": "Sea ice trends", "text": "In the last three decades, the Antarctic sea-ice extent has slightly increased as a result of opposite regional trends including a decrease of sea ice in the Amundsen Sea and an increase in the Ross Sea (e.g., Comiso and Nishio, 2008; Zwally et al., 2002; Abram et al., 2013) . These observed regional trends are statistically most significant in autumn and spring (Turner et al., 2009) . In March, both observed and modelled trends are more variable than in September (Fig. 24) . Models fail to reproduce the observed decrease of sea ice in the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Sea, which is partly due to the already low modelled sea-ice extent in the region. Elsewhere, trends look variable without clear directions.\nThe September NOAA OI.v2 SST sea-ice edge location shows a slight increase from 45\u00b0E to 220\u00b0E and a small decrease between 220\u00b0E and 270\u00b0E. Only one model, FSU, shows a very strong decline of sea ice in the Ross Sea and in the Weddell Sea which appears unrealistic. The MMM captures the decrease of sea ice in the Amundsen Sea, but not the increase in the Ross Sea. The decrease of sea ice is driven by warming of western Antarctica due to increased large-scale atmospheric heat transport from the mid-latitudes, and compensating equatorward oceanic heat transport anomalies (Farneti et al., 2010) . In contrast, the Ross Sea cooling, driven by strong cold southerly winds blowing to the north from the Antarctic interior, increases seaice cover there. A realistic simulation of the cold southerly winds requires a high resolution topography and polar specific physical parameterisations, which are not in the CORE-II atmospheric state. The erroneous wind and temperature fields could be reasons why models do not reproduce the observed increase of sea ice in the Ross Sea (Barth\u00e9lemy et al., 2012; Mathiot et al., 2010; St\u00f6ssel et al., 2011) . Another possibility is that upper ocean freshening from increases in Antarctic runoff that has been proposed as a mechanism for the Ross Sea sea-ice increases (Bintanja et al., 2013) are not captured in the CORE forcing which uses a climatological value for Antarctic runoff."}, {"section_title": "Are there simulated polynyas in the Weddell Sea?", "text": "The Weddell Polynya was a distinct feature of Antarctic sea ice in the mid-1970s (Carsey, 1980) . Its occurrence and movement has to some extent been explained by ocean stratification and (1988) (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) describing the relationship between the March (top) and September (bottom) mixed layer depth regions exceeding 50 m and 300 m, and the westerly wind stress (\u03c4 x ) position (red), westerly wind strength (blue), freshwater flux into the ocean (green), heat flux into the ocean (magenta), heat loss to the ocean (cyan), March sea-ice edge (black), and September sea-ice edge (red).

No other polynyas of this magnitude have been observed, and it is unclear whether it will occur again. We do not expect that details of the physical drivers (e.g., wind stress divergences) are contained in the CORE-II atmospheric state, particularly since this period of the dataset is prior to incorporation of satellite information. Nonetheless, we investigate how sea ice in the CORE-II simulations responds during the 1970s.\nFor the analysis, we looked at the minimum monthly ice concentration for each of the models and the Nimbus-5 ESMR data in September 1974-1976 when the Weddell Polynya occurs according to the observational Nimbus-5 ESMR data (Fig. 27) . The observed location of the Weddell Polynya is between 70\u00b0S and 60\u00b0S and approximately from 330\u00b0E to 10\u00b0E, where the ice concentration stays below 10% throughout winter, and is surrounded by dense pack ice with ice concentration above 90%. As evident from Fig. 27 , no CORE-II model simulates the Weddell Polynya realistically. Three models, ACCESS, GFDL-MOM and MRI, show areas of ice concentration less than 10% in the Weddell Sea, but this area is less extensive than the Weddell Polynya and it is located too far west. A majority of models-BERGEN, CMCC, FSU, GFDL-GOLD, GFDL-MOM025, GISS, ICTP, INMOM and NCAR, show a moderate decrease in sea-ice concentration within the proximity of the Weddell Polynya, but not as much as observed. Finally, three models, AWI, KIEL05, and NOCS, do not indicate any polynya type of features in the Weddell Sea.\nDe Lavergne et al. (2014) found that among the present generation of climate models, deep convection is common in the Southern Ocean under pre-industrial conditions, but weakens and ceases under a climate change scenario owing to surface freshening. We also inspected the minimum September ice concentrations for CORE-II models from the full 1948-2007 period of the last cycle to see whether distinct polynyas develop during other periods than in [1974] [1975] [1976] . We found that models that do not display polynyas in the Weddell Sea in 1974 -1976 Because none of the CORE-II models are able to simulate the Weddell Polynya as it appeared, we cannot provide a comprehensive reasoning for its formation. Since the CORE-II atmospheric state is identical across the models, inter-model differences in polynya formation arise from the simulation of oceanic processes and topography. We conjecture that differences between model simulations do not arise from sea-ice processes, since sea ice over these relatively local spatial scales, away from coastal regions, is largely driven by atmospheric and oceanic conditions."}, {"section_title": "Subsurface temperature trends", "text": "Given the potential for sea-level rise associated with melting land ice, there are concerns about changes in ocean temperature for waters interacting with ice shelves around Antarctica. We therefore present trends in the 200-700 m averaged temperatures (Fig. 23 ). Most models indicate no coherent pattern near the coast, particularly in the Weddell Sea. This disagreement between models is also evident in the September MLD trend in the same region (Fig. 22) . However, the GFDL-MOM025, GISS, ICTP, INMOM, and KIEL05 models show overall polar warming. This warming pattern that circles the Antarctic coast is also seen in idealised wind perturbation experiments using the same GFDL-MOM025 configuration (Spence et al., 2014) , and is likely associated with a combination of wind and surface buoyancy fluxes. The warming in GFDL-MOM025 relates to shoaling of the relatively warm coastal current around Antarctica, associated with a weakening of Ekman downwelling next to the coast. Representing the dynamics of this current, along with its fluctuations and trends, generally requires fine resolution in both the ocean and the atmospheric winds."}, {"section_title": "Summary and conclusions", "text": "We evaluated the representation of the Southern Ocean mixed layer depth, sea ice, and water mass properties in 15 global oceanice models participating in the CORE-II effort. Our analysis is in part driven by the hypothesis that the common atmospheric state applied to these models results in a similar representation of Southern Ocean water mass and sea-ice features for the 1988-2007 period. Results that were coherent across the CORE-II models for the 20 year mean are schematised in Fig. 28 . The following conclusions can be drawn from this study. (Marshall, 2003) from the CORE-II forcing for the entire cycle . The relative flattening of the trend during the final 20 years may explain the modest role of wind trends on mixed layer depth trends in the CORE-II simulations.\n\u2022 The March (summertime) mixed layer depth is overall shallower than observed in mode and intermediate water mass formation regions. The uniform shallow bias across the CORE-II models indicates the CORE-II atmospheric state largely dictates the summer mixed layer, in particular the wind stress strength and position. Conversely, the September (winter) mixed layers differ significantly across the models. However, most models represented the mode and intermediate water mass September mixed layer depths deeper than observed and positioned further poleward. The CORE-II models with considerably deeper than observed September mixed layer depth biases also showed large regions of surface heat loss, large saline biases north of 50\u00b0S in the upper 200 m, deeper than observed Sub-Antarctic Mode Water (SAMW) low potential vorticity layers in the Pacific, and a more poleward displaced Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) salinity minimum layer. Examples are the ACCESS, BERGEN, FSU, and ICTP models. \u2022 Significant spatial correlations between regions of deep mixed layers and wind stress, surface buoyancy fluxes and sea ice indicate that shallower March mixed layers are associated with weaker and more poleward positioned westerlies. Spatial correlations varied in sign for the September mixed layers, however the majority of significant spatial correlations showed that deeper September mixed layer depth areas are associated with larger surface heat and freshwater input, and sea ice positioned further poleward.\n\u2022 Whilst the models represent similar spatial patterns for the March and September 20 year mixed layer depth trends, the association of these trends with surface buoyancy, wind stress, and sea-ice is incoherent. In addition, the spatial pattern in the September mixed layer depth biases varies both in sign and magnitude for the 1988-2007 period.\n\u2022 Below 200 m, the CORE-II models have a cold/fresh bias south of \u223c50\u00b0S, and warm/salty bias to the north, with biases largest in the Pacific sector. These biases lead to a favourable density structure compared with observations. However, these temperature and salinity biases result in deeper than observed mode and intermediate water mass mixed layer depths, and shallower than observed polar mixed layers.\n\u2022 The surface water mass transformation rates, driven by heat and freshwater fluxes, vary widely between models. The volume transport across 30\u00b0S implies a stronger than observed upper ocean overturning cell, and weaker than observed deep flow. We conjecture that this transport bias is less likely linked to common CORE-II atmospheric state. Rather, it is more likely linked to weak bottom water formation and overturning inherent in coarse resolution level coordinate ocean climate models.\n\u2022 The March sea-ice concentration was lower than observed around the Antarctic continent, and neither the mean or linear trend in sea-ice extent were similarly depicted across the models. The September sea-ice concentration biases are both positive and negative around the Antarctic continent, with little agreement in sign and magnitude across the models. While the models captured the decreased sea ice in the West Antarctic (1988) (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) , they failed to coherently represent an increase in the Ross Sea, and this failure is likely linked to biases in wind stress over the Antarctic continent. The modelled September sea-ice retreat north of the Ross Sea can indirectly influence the simulated increase in September mixed layer depths in the southwest Pacific. Sea-ice retreat increases the ocean surface area available for heat loss via atmosphere-ocean fluxes.\nWe found that the NCAR and NOCS models performed best in terms of their representation of the SAMW low potential vorticity (Parkinson et al., 2004) . During this period, an ice-free region developed in the thick sea ice within Weddell Sea region, known as the Weddell Sea polynya. There is no clear trend in the Weddell Sea polynya within the CORE-II simulations. Fig. 28 . Schematic summarising the multi model mean biases and oceanic processes coherently represented in the CORE-II models for the 1988-2007 present state. Overlying westerlies and surface heat gain primarily deepen the summer (March) mixed layer depths, with surface heat loss and sea-ice playing are associated with deeper winter (September) mixed layers. In the ocean interior, the models exhibit a cool and fresh bias south of 50\u00b0S, and warm and salty bias to the north. The thick horizontal black arrows are representative of the direction of volume transport across 30\u00b0S within the approximate density layers (\u03c3 2 ; kg m \u22123 ). The water masses in these layers are (top to bottom): southward flowing thermocline waters (TW), northward flowing mode/intermediate waters (MW), southward flowing deep waters (DW), and northward flowing bottom waters (BW). Whilst the March sea-ice concentration is overall lower than observed, the September sea-ice concentration biases vary in sign and strength around the Antarctic continent.\nand AAIW salinity minimum layers, and shallower seasonal mixed layer depth biases and temperature and salinity biases (south of 40\u00b0S) compared with other CORE-II models. We did not find the model vertical coordinate (four of the models use an isopycnal or hybrid coordinate) to be a contributing factor to model differences in ocean and ice representation. Model resolution (focusing on GFDL-MOM025) also did not improve most of the Southern Ocean metrics presented here, however the summertime sea ice was better captured by GFDL-MOM025. Both GFDL-MOM and GFDL-MOM025 have similar seasonal mixed layer depth biases, transformation rates, and a smaller than observed salinity minimum layer.\nDetails of the models' ocean-sea ice configurations, including the treatment and strength of surface salinity restoration, do influence their water mass exchange and interior transformation. However, there is sizable coherence in representing sea-ice trends, mixed layer depths, and surface buoyancy across the Southern Ocean, both regionally and in a zonal mean. This result suggests, at least tentatively, that the CORE-II approach offers a useful means to uncover mechanisms for Southern Ocean climate over the years [1988] [1989] [1990] [1991] [1992] [1993] [1994] [1995] [1996] [1997] [1998] [1999] [2000] [2001] [2002] [2003] [2004] [2005] [2006] [2007] . This upbeat conclusion must be caveated by a huge degree of uncertainty both in the atmospheric state in the Southern Ocean, and the observational record for use in evaluating simulations. project offices, particularly Anna Pirani.
