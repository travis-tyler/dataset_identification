[{"section_title": "", "text": "Student's academic self-concept (ASC) also has been identified as a variable strongly associated with student academic achievement. Although both parental expectations and ASC have direct associations with academic achievement, the association among the three variables is not as straight forward as one would initially think. Gonzalez-Pineda, Carlos Nunez, and Gonzalez-Pumariega (2002) found ASC to be causally related to academic achievement, but the reverse relationship to not be true. Here, ASC was a causal variable such that students' math ASC influenced their performance in math. However, students' math grades did not impact their math ASC (Gonzalez-Pineda, Carlos Nunez, & Gonzalez-Pumariega, 2002) . Marsh et al. (2005) presented evidence that contradicted the findings of Gonzalez-Pineda, Carlos Nunez, & Gonzalez-Pumariega (2002) . Using structural equation modeling (SEM), Marsh and colleagues established support for a reciprocal relationship model between ASC and student math achievement. The reciprocal relationship model asserts that ASC is both a causal variable and an outcome variable as it relates to student achievement. For example, a student's prior math ASC affects subsequent math achievement and prior math achievement affects subsequent math ASC. Neuenshwander et al. (2007) provided further evidence suggesting that students' prior academic achievement affects their ASC. This relationship, however, was mediated by parental expectations such that parents' interpretations of their children's grades and test scores and the effect that these have on their children's scholastic standing goes on to affect the stability of children's ASC. Academic self-concept also was found to serve as a partial mediator between parental expectations and student academic achievement (Neuenshwander et al., 2007) . The study by Neuenshwander and colleagues highlights the importance of parental expectations as they relate to ASC, student academic achievement and the intertwined nature of these variables.\nExisting research has varied in terms of establishing ASC as a causal variable, a mediator, or an outcome variable. As such, we can safely state that ASC is a complex variable which holds great relevance for student's scholastic experience. Its significance in the academic milieu points to the important role that affective dimensions play on a student's academic success. The existing research also suggests that external forces, such as parental expectations, are critical in developing student's affective dimensions and, ultimately, on their academic success. The research questions proposed by the current study take into account both external and internal dimensions and their effect on the academic achievement of students.\nPast research has asserted that ASC is a complex variable that serves as a causal variable at times as well an outcome variable (Marsh et al., 2005 and Gonzalez-Pineda, Carlos Nunez, & Gonzalez-Pumariega, 2002) . Many of the more recent studies have considered mediators or moderators of the relationships between parental expectations and achievements. Curiously, few of these studies focused on student's own ASC, that is, his/her own self-efficacy, as a mediator of the expectations-achievement relationship (Neuenshwander et al., 2007) . Given the immense literature linking ASC to academic achievement (e.g., see Craven & Marsh, 2008) and identifying ASC as a mediator between important other relationships, the omission of this research is critical. Also, missing from the literature is any investigation of effects on these relationships, despite the growing literature in school psychology and elsewhere that considers how relationships may operate differently in different environments (e.g., Rhodes, Roffman, Reddy & Fredriksen, 2004; Stage, 2001 ).\nThe goal of the present study was to use multi-level modeling methodology applied to the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K) to investigate the relationships between prior (5th grade) student achievement and parental expectations, subsequent (8th grade) parental expectations, and concurrent (8th grade) student achievement in the context of the students' current (8th grade) school. Additionally, we investigated the role of ASC as a mediator between these variables. Specifically, our questions were: "}, {"section_title": "Methodology Samples", "text": "The ECLS-K dataset is comprised of a base-year nationally stratified sample of 17,401 students who began kindergarten in Fall 1998. Data were collected at various points in students' kindergarten, first and third grade years, and in the spring semester of 2004 when most students were in the fifth grade. Data was also collected when students were in eighth grade. The present study used only fifth grade and eighth grade data. Consistent with suggestions on the use of HLM methodology (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002) , students were only selected if there were at least five students in the dataset from each school. Because there were very few missing data (< 5%) and HLM will not accommodate missing data, only those students with data on all variables were included. The resulting sample was comprised of 4535 students who were included in both the fifth grade and eighth grade data collection from 502 middle or K-8 schools (399 public, 103 private). See Table 1 for students' demographic information. . "}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": "Based on data available in the ECLS-K dataset and on the extant literature on ASC and its relationship with other variables, we chose to include five student-level measures in this study: 8 th grade reading and math ASC (separate measures), 5\nth and 8 th grade tested reading and math achievement, student socio-economic status (SES), and gender. School-wide (8 th grade schools) parental expectations were the only school-level variables.\nAcademic Self-Concept (ASC). The ECLS-K dataset includes two academic self-concept subscales from the Self-Description Questionnaire (SDQ; Reading, Math), each having 4 -8 Likert items, each with a 4-point scale. The SDQ is a widely-used research measure of self-concept with amply demonstrated reliability and validity. Reliabilities (alpha coefficients) for in the larger data set are excellent (8th grade: .76 -.89). The composite score for each scale is the average of the scale's items, such that the composite score can range from 1.00 to 4.00.\nAchievement. Achievement scores in reading and math are standardized T-scores resulting from direct assessments of the child. Extensive evidence supporting the tests' validity is reported in the ECLS-K manuals. Reported reliabilities at both grade levels are excellent (reading: 5th -.93, 8th -.87; math: 5th -.94, 8th, -.92).\nParental Expectations. Parental expectations were ascertained in both 5 th and 8 th grade. Parents were asked how far they expected their children to go in school and were able to respond with one of six possible answers. Parental Expectations scores were: 1 -less than H.S. ed., 2 -graduate H.S., 3 -two or more years of college, 4 -college degree; 5 -master's degree or equivalent; 6 -doctoral or other advanced degree"}, {"section_title": "Socioeconomic Status (SES).", "text": "The SES measure in the ECLS-K that we used is a composite based on parental education and occupation, and family income. This continuous measure is a standardized measure (z-score) ranging in the larger dataset from about +/-two standard deviations.\nGender. Gender was dichotomously coded from the base-year student file.\nStandardization of Individual Level Variables. All of the continuous variables (Academic self-concept, reading and math achievement, parental expectations, and SES) were converted to Z-scores based on the entire sample.\nSchool Level Measures. One school-level (i.e., characteristics of schools) measure was used as an independent variable, and was simply the aggregated values (school-wide means) of individual students' standardized parental expectations."}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis", "text": "All analyses of individual student variables used data weighted by a weight (C67PW0) from the ECLS-K that most closely corresponded to the subset of data that we used. A new weight was then calculated by dividing each students' C67PWO weight by the mean value of C67PWO, thus producing a \"normalized\" or \"relative\" weight. Relative weights apply the appropriate weighting to individual students' data while preserving the original, unweighted sample size (Hahs-Vaughn, 2005) . Following descriptive analyses of all data (see Table 2 ), we performed a series of four HLM analyses separately for each of the two dependent achievement variables (reading, math), in the following order: (a) an Unconditional Model, used to establish a base for comparison and to assess the amount of variance due to \"group effects\"; (b) a Within-Schools Model in which only individual, student characteristics were modeled; (c) an Intercept-as-Outcome Model, which analyzed the relationships between hypothesized school characteristics and students' achievement net of student's characteristics within schools; and (d) a Cross-Level Interaction Effects Model, which analyzed the effects of school-wide characteristics on relationships between parental expectations and student characteristics within schools (also referenced in the HLM literature as Slopes-as-Outcomes models). After performing the series of HLM models listed above, for both math and reading achievement as outcome measures we followed the procedures outlined by Zhang, Zyphur, and Preacher (2009) to test mediator effects in multi-level models. Additionally, to address our question regarding the effects of 5 th grade achievement on 8 th grade parental expectations, we performed both Unconditional and Within-Schools HLM models. Because the students who were in the various 8 th grade schools were not together in the same 5 th grade schools, we did not conduct analyses with school-level variables for this question."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Results of the HLM analyses relating both parental expectations for individual students and school-wide parental expectations to student achievement were similar, generally, for 8th grade achievement in both math and reading. Intraclass correlations (ICCs) were very similar for reading (.30) and math (.27), indicating that a substantial proportion of the variance in both achievement measures was attributable to schools, i.e., schoollevel variables. Fifth grade individual parental expectations were significant (p < .001) predictors of both 8th grade reading (\u03b2 = .16) and math (\u03b2 = .17) achievement, when controlling for student gender and SES. However, student SES was a stronger predictor for both reading (\u03b2 = .24) and math (\u03b2 = .27) achievement, and gender (\u03b2 = -.21) was a stronger predictor for math achievement. Similarly, 8th grade individual parental expectations were significant (p < .001) predictors of 8th grade reading (\u03b2 = .21) and math (\u03b2 = .21) achievement, when controlling for gender and SES. Not surprisingly, 8th grade parental expectations were generally more strongly related to 8th grade achievement than were parental expectations from the earlier 5th grade point. SES was about equally related to reading and math achievement compared to 8th grade parental expectations. Notably, though, all of the statistically significant relationships were small in magnitude, ranging mostly between .15 and .20. Data are summarized in Table 3 . For both 8th grade reading and math achievement outcomes and for both 5th grade and 8th grade individual parental expectations we investigated the possibility that students' academic self-concepts (ASCs) in reading and math, respectively, would mediate the relationship between parental expectations and achievement. That is, we asked whether there was both a direct path between parental expectations and achievement, and an indirect path from parental expectations to ASC to achievement. In all four cases (5th and 8th parental expectations; reading and math achievement), ASC served as a partial mediator of the expectations/achievement relationship. Between 25 and 40 percent of the observed relationships between parental expectations and achievement were attributable to ASC as a mediator between these variables. See Table 3 for detailed results.\nSchool-wide parental expectations in the 8th grade schools, of substantial interest to the present study, were not significantly related to either 8th grade reading or math achievement, net of individual students' gender, SES, and individual parental expectations. To further examine the possible effects of school-level parental expectations on achievement, we also looked at the cross-level interactions between school-level parental expectations and the relationships between individual students' gender, SES, and parental expectations and 8th grade achievement in reading and math. As shown in Table 3 , no such interactions were found for gender or SES, but for both reading and math achievement small, negative cross-level interactions (reading = -.13; math = -.08) were found between school-level parental expectations and individual parental expectations, indicating that in schools with higher average parental expectations there was a smaller relationship between individual students' parental expectations and achievement.\nAs a separate question, we explored the relationship between 5th grade achievement in reading and math, and 8th grade parental expectations. Both 5th grade reading (\u03b2 = .12) and math (\u03b2 = .13) achievement predicted parental expectations at 8th grade (when accounting for the effects of gender and SES), but both SES and gender were slightly more related to 8th grade parental expectations than were either reading or math achievement as separate measures. However, the combined effects of reading and math achievement accounted for more of the variance in subsequent parental expectations than did either SES or gender. Note. * p < .05; ** p < .01***; p < .001. Data on individual level data are all weighted. All individual and school level data controlled for the effects of gender and SES."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The goal of the present study was to use multi-level modeling methodology applied to the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K) to investigate the relationship between parental expectations and student achievement. The role of student's ASC as a mediator of the aforementioned relationship was investigated. Additionally, the degree to which school-wide parental expectations contribute to student achievement also was investigated.\nThe results showed that individual parental expectations had a significant effect on student achievement, when accounting for gender and SES (i.e. higher parental expectations result in higher student achievement). When predicting current student achievement, current parental expectations appeared to have more of an effect than previous parental expectations. In addition to parental expectations, gender and SES appeared to have effects on student achievement; in fact, generally these variables shared a stronger relationship with achievement than did parental expectations.\nThe relationship between previous and current parental expectations and student achievement was partially mediated by student's ASC. Specifically, parental expectations were both directly and indirectly associated with student achievement and the indirect association was mediated by student's ASC. This supports previous research by Neuenshwander and colleagues (2007) who also found ASC to mediate the association between parental expectations and student achievement.\nAfter accounting for individual-level parental expectations, school-wide parental expectations did not have an effect on student achievement. However, school-wide parental expectations were found to moderate the association between individual level parental expectations and student achievement. Schools with higher average parental expectations showed a decreased relationship between individual parental expectations and student achievement."}, {"section_title": "Implications", "text": "Findings from the present study suggest that those studying academic achievement need to take into account how students' academic achievement is affected by parental expectations and by students' self-perceptions about their academic abilities. More specifically, the expectations that parents hold for their children were shown to significantly contribute to students' academic success directly as well as via the influence had by these parental expectations on students' ASCs.\nAlthough parental expectations at the individual level appear to be important in predicting achievement, the present findings suggest that other variables such as gender and SES have a larger effect on academic achievement. However, it is important to note that at the individual level, parental expectations is something that can be altered in contrast to gender or SES. Therefore, schools should use this to their advantage. Given that parental expectations were shown to predict academic achievement, even if it was less than the effect of gender and SES, programs should be created to target such topics as parental expectations that both impact students' academic achievement and are under the individual's control. There also should be implementation of programs that focus on students' ASC. Perhaps students can work to adjust their ASC since this has been shown in prior research to impact current achievement.\nThe absence of a significant relationship between school-level parental expectations and student achievement, after accounting for individual parental expectations, suggests students may be less affected by factors in their global environment compared to those in their immediate environment. This conclusion, however, is unlikely given previous research that finds school-level factors to be strongly associated with student-level outcomes (Marsh, 1990; Gray-Little & Carels, 1997; Rhodes et al, 2004) . A more plausible conclusion may have to do with the ambiguous definition of parental expectations. Research typically has used parental expectations to refer to realistic goal judgments that parents hold for their children (Glick & White, 2004; Yamamoto & Holloway, 2010) . However, the concept of parental expectations easily can be mistaken with parental aspirations (Seginer, 1983) if attention is not paid to making the distinction clear. While parental expectations refers to parents' realistic judgments about the futures of their children, parental aspirations refers to goals and desires that parents have for their children's future (Seginer, 1983) ."}, {"section_title": "Limitations and Future Directions", "text": "There were two main limitations of the present study. First, as previously mentioned, the definition of parental expectations was ambiguous and therefore one cannot be sure exactly what parents are answering when they are providing their ratings. It is possible that some parents are describing their realistic judgments about their children's future while other parents are commenting on how far they hope their children will achieve. Future studies would benefit from the inclusion of a more clearly defined parental expectation variable to ensure the researchers are clear as to what the parents are providing ratings on.\nA second limitation of the present study concerns the exclusion of ethnicity from the analyses. Ethnicity was not included because many of the samples of students from individual schools contained no members of the major racial/ethnic groups. Previous research has asserted that there is a connection between ethnicity and academic achievement. Reporting on the findings from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) main assessments in mathematics and reading, Hemphill & Vanneman (2011) state that although achievement levels have increased for both Whites and Hispanics from 1990 to 2009, the achievement gap has persisted such that Whites achieve significantly higher than Hispanics in reading and math. Using the ECLS-K dataset, Benner and Crosnoe (2011) found the school's racial/ethnic composition to be significantly associated with student achievement in reading and math. Other research has found associations between ethnicity and parental expectations (Yamamoto & Holloway, 2010) suggesting that ethnicity may moderate the association between academic achievement and parental expectations. Future studies should continue to assess sociocultural differences and the potential impact ethnicity may have on the findings of the present study."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Existing research has shown that several factors impact student academic achievement, including ASC and parental expectations. The present study adds to this line of research by demonstrating the relations among all three variables: parental expectations, ASC, and academic achievement at both the individual and school-wide level. The present findings suggest that attention needs to be paid to both parental expectations and how these expectations go on to both directly and indirectly impact students' achievement. Perhaps schools would benefit their students' academic achievement by reaching out to parents with information on the importance of their expectations on their children's academic performance as well as how to express realistic and supportive expectations to their children."}]
