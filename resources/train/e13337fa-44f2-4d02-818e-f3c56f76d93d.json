[{"section_title": "| INTRODUC TI ON", "text": "Since December 2019, the world has been dealing with the outbreak of the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) leading to Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) that emerged in Wuhan, China. The outbreak in this city led to a major world crisis, the COVID-19 Pandemic. 1, 2 SARS-CoV-2 is a non-segmented positive-sense RNA virus causing the third betacoronavirus outbreak of this century, which appears to have a higher transmission rate but is less deadly than the previous two; SARS-CoV 2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) 2012. 3, 4 Prior studies demonstrated that the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is 79.5% identical to SARS-CoV, whereas it shares 96.2% of its identity to the Coronavirus RaTG13 found in bats, but the intermediate reservoir has yet to be identified. 5 While patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 typically present with fever and respiratory symptoms, a rapidly increasing number of studies report patients presenting with a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain. 6 The established transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 is through respiratory droplets (aerosols), mainly during close person-to-person contact, 7 whereas numerous reports also mention the transmission by infected surfaces. Based on the spread through aerosols, the diagnosis of active COVID-19 infection primarily relies on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in specimens from the upper respiratory tract (URT; nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal cavity) and/or lower respiratory specimens (LRT; sputum and/or bronchoalveolar lavage). 8, 9 Knowledge about SARS-CoV-2's other potential routes of transmission and the significance of different methods of testing is relatively sparse, 10 partly as a result of the novelty of this virus.\nHowever, there is a growing body of studies in which SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in stool samples (including anal swabs) from COVID-19 patients. 11 These findings support the possibility of a faecal-oral route of transmission. Interestingly, stool tests seem to remain positive when respiratory tests are, or have become, negative. [12] [13] [14] A few articles have briefly reviewed the rapidly increasing body of knowledge on the potential for faecal-oral transmission. 11, 15, 16 This study aims to (1) critically assess the clinical relevance of testing stool samples and anal swabs and (2) provide a critical overview of the available literature regarding the faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2."}, {"section_title": "| Literature Search", "text": "This systematic literature search was performed following the PRISMA guidelines and conducted using the Embase database, Google scholar, The MEDLINE database through PubMed and The Cochrane Library from the outbreak in December 2019 until the 17 June 2020. The search strategy can be found in Online Supplement 1.\nAll articles were imported to Mendeley (version 1.17.6), and duplicates were removed. Extensive cross-checking of reference lists of the included articles and other reviews was performed. As a result of the rapidly evolving research field concerning COVID \u221219, we also included journal pre-proof articles."}, {"section_title": "| Study selection", "text": "All articles were screened based on title and abstract. Studies were included when the following inclusion criteria were met: We excluded articles written before December 2019, when the article or abstract/outcomes were not available in English, Dutch or German and when the results or quality of data were ambiguous.\nPapers written in Chinese, of which the abstract contained sufficient data to provide answers to our research questions, were included for analysis and data extraction. We excluded articles in which follow-up data were insufficient (ie when results of stool testing were not mentioned).

After the exclusion of articles which met the exclusion criteria, we included a total of 95 articles for final analysis. Figure 1 shows details of the selection procedure.\nThe majority of the included studies were performed in China (74 (77%)), other studies were conducted in Korea (6), Singapore (2), the United States of America (5), Italy (4), France (1), Germany (1), Thailand (1) and Austria (1). All included studies had a case report/ case series design. In most study populations, the subpopulation on which stool and/or anal testing were conducted was considerably lower. In total, stool samples or anal swabs (from now on collectively named as GI specimens) from 2175 patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Four studies were included for qualitative analysis, but due to the lack of necessary (follow-up) information, these studies were excluded before final quantitative analysis. [17] [18] [19] [20] Therefore, 2149 patients were included for final analysis. "}, {"section_title": "| Test Characteristics", "text": "Seventeen (18%) studies tested SARS-CoV-2 presence in anal swabs and 81 (85%) in stool samples. In three studies, both specimens were tested. In all studies but one, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect SARS-CoV-2. One study performed inoculation of stool suspension into Vero cells followed by virus detection through electron microscopy. 21"}, {"section_title": "| Outcomes", "text": "In 91/95 (96%) of the included studies, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was identified in GI specimens from at least one of the included patients (Tables 1 & 2 Twelve studies discussed the association between positive GI specimens and GI symptoms. 13, 14, 19, [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] In all studies, the majority of patients with GI symptoms tested positive in GI specimens, but the association was not statistically significant in most studies. In the study by Han et al, it was observed that patients with GI symptoms were significantly more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 in a stool test (P = 0.033). 44 Furthermore, Cheung et al found that the proportion of positive stool tests and the stool viral load was higher in patients with diarrhoea than without (P = 0.019 and 0.06 respectively). 46 In addition to the clinical symptoms and the positive GI specimens testing, two studies detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in endoscopic specimens of the oesophagus, stomach, duodenum and rectum in 1/1 and 2/6 patients. 41, 45 Viability of SARS-CoV-2 was investigated and detected in five studies, in which six patients (6/17 (35%)) had live active virus in their GI specimens using Vero cell testing. 19, 21, [47] [48] [49] "}, {"section_title": "| D ISCUSS I ON", "text": "In this study, we performed a systematic review of the rapidly expanding body of literature to assess the performance and accuracy The results of this study may have various consequences for the diagnosis, prognosis and spread of COVID-19. First and foremost, worldwide the decision to isolate or discharge a patient is primarily based on relevant clinical symptoms, focusing on the respiratory tract, and (sequential) negative test results on respiratory specimens collected more than 24 hours apart. 57 We observed that in 64% of patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in GI specimens, their GI specimens remained positive for a mean of 12.5 days after respiratory samples became negative. As a result, a number of patients were discharged up to a month before the absence of SARS-CoV-2 in GI specimens could be guaranteed. The (additional) use of GI specimen testing may provide a more appropriate rationale for isolation and discharge.\nA major concern could be continuing person-to-person transmission by the faecal-oral route, which argues for closer attention to hand and sanitation hygiene. This should be considered when determining diagnosis and isolation policies.\nIn general the risk to health care professionals from patient exposure is well known, specifically in high aerosol-generating procedures. Currently, medical management protocols include measures to mitigate the aerosol transmission risks from procedures related to respiratory tract. 8 As a result, our analyses were based on relatively small patient groups (median 9; range 1-401 patients) and inconsistent methods, parameters, sample timing, sample frequencies and study endpoints differing widely between the included studies, impeding comparisons and robust conclusions. In the early response to the emerging COVID-19 outbreak, only respiratory specimens were required for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 according to initial clinical guidelines. A lot of studies, therefore, refrained from obtaining GI specimens from the patients during their first few days of hospitalisation or observation and could not determine whether respiratory and GI specimens were positive on RT-PCR analysis simultaneously.\nFurthermore, the phenomenon that viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2 can remain positive in GI specimens after respiratory samples became negative was not identified in all studies. This resulted in inadequate (follow-up) information, potentially causing a (outcome) measurement bias.\nThe sole four studies that reported no positive tests in GI specimens were all based on small sample size (1-4 patients) and the testing was performed at an early stage of the disease course. Our review demonstrated that there seems a tendency for SARS-CoV-2\nto be more detectable in the respiratory tract at an early stage of the disease and later on, more likely to be detected in GI specimens, which could explain the early negative testing.\nOur review confirms that SARS-Cov-2 is commonly present in stool samples or anal swabs in which the virus can persist long after respiratory testing has become negative and that the virus may be viable. This suggests the possibility of faecal-oral transmission and that stool sample or anal swab testing should be (re)considered in relation to decisions for isolating or discharging a patient."}, {"section_title": "AU T H O R S H I P", "text": "Guarantor of the article: NdB.
