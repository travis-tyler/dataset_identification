Various pre-existing conditions have been reported to correlate with increased risk of poor outcomes. In a re-analysis of a large aggregated case series dataset from the Chinese center for disease control and prevention (44, 672 patients, 1,023 deaths), cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, respiratory disease, and cancers were all associated with increased risk of death. 5 These factors often correlate with age, but correction for age was not possible in the available data. More recently, a large UK cross-sectional survey describing 16,749 patients already hospitalised with COVID-19 showed higher risk of death for patients with cardiac, pulmonary and kidney disease, as well as malignancy, dementia and obesity (hazard ratios 1.19-1.39 after age and sex correction). 6 Obesity has been reported as a risk factor for treatment escalation in a French ITU cohort (n=124) and a New York hospital presentation cohort (n=3615). 7, 8 The risks associated with smoking are disputed: increased risks were initially reported; recent studies suggest that smokers are underrepresented among those with more severe disease; and a potential protective mechanism for nicotine has been suggested. 9 Smoking prevalence among hospitalised patients was lower than expected in China (1,099 patients, 12.6% vs 28% in the general population), 10 and in a small French study (139 outpatients and 343 inpatients; Standardized Incidence Ratios 0.197 and 0.246, respectively). 11 People from black and minority ethnic (BME) groups are at increased risk of bad outcomes from COVID-19, but explanations for this association are unclear. 12, 13 We therefore set out to determine factors associated with risk of death from COVID-19 in England using a very large sample of the adult population, with deaths data linked to longitudinal primary care electronic health records.

OpenSAFELY provides a secure software interface that allows detailed pseudonymised primary care patient records to be analysed in near realtime where they already reside, hosted within the EHR vendor's highly secure data centre, to minimise the re-identification risks when data are transported off-site; other smaller datasets are linked to these data within the same environment using a matching pseudonym derived from the NHS number. More information can be found on https://opensafely.org/.\nThe dataset analysed with OpenSAFELY for this paper is based on 24 million currently registered patients (approximately 40% of the English population) from GP surgeries using the TPP SystmOne electronic health record system. It extends to 20 billion rows of structured data characterising (for example) pseudonymised patients' diagnoses, medications, physiological parameters, and prior investigations.

To be included in the study, participants were required to have at least 1 year of prior follow-up in the GP practice to ensure that baseline patient characteristics could be adequately captured, and to have a recorded sex and age. 19 Patients were observed from the 1st of February 2020 and were followed until the first of either their death date (whether COVID-19 related or due to other causes) or the study end date, 25th April 2020. For this analysis, CPNS death data were available up to 25th April 2020; ONS death data (used for censoring individuals who died without the outcome) were available to 16th April 2020; patient censoring for deaths due to other causes was therefore not possible during the last 9 days of followup (see Discussion, weaknesses; a sensitivity analysis is presented with all data censored at 6th April 2020 in appendix Table A1 )."}, {"section_title": "Outcomes", "text": "The outcome was in-hospital death among people with confirmed COVID-19, ascertained from the COVID-19 Patient Notification System (CPNS)."}, {"section_title": "Covariates", "text": "Potential risk factors included: health conditions listed in UK guidance on \"higher risk\" groups; 20 other common conditions which may cause immunodeficiency inherently or through medication (cancer and common autoimmune conditions); and emerging risk factors for severe outcomes among COVID-19 cases (such as raised blood pressure).\nAge, sex, body mass index (BMI; kg/m 2 ), and smoking status were considered as potential risk factors. Where categorised, age groups were: 18-<40, 40-<50, 50-<60, 60-<70, 70-<80, 80+ years. BMI was ascertained from weight measurements within the last 10 years, restricted to those taken when the patient was over 16 years old. Obesity was grouped using categories derived from the World Health Organisation classification of BMI: no evidence of obesity <30 kg/m 2 ; obese I 30-34.9; obese II 35-39.9; obese III 40+. Smoking status was grouped into current, former and never smokers\nThe following comorbidities were also considered potential risk factors: asthma, other chronic respiratory disease, chronic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic liver disease, chronic neurological diseases, common autoimmune diseases (Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) or psoriasis), solid organ transplant, asplenia, other immunosuppressive conditions, cancer, evidence of reduced kidney function, and raised blood pressure or a diagnosis of hypertension.\nDisease groupings followed national guidance on risk of influenza infection, 21 therefore \"chronic respiratory disease (other than asthma)\" included COPD, fibrosing lung disease, bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis; chronic heart disease included chronic heart failure, ischaemic heart disease, and severe valve or congenital heart disease likely to require lifelong follow up. Chronic neurological conditions were separated into diseases with a likely cardiovascular aetiology (stroke, TIA, dementia) and conditions in which respiratory function may be compromised such as motor neurone disease, myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy, quadriplegia or hemiplegia, malignant primary brain tumour, and progressive cerebellar disease. Asplenia included splenectomy or a spleen dysfunction, including sickle cell disease. Other immunosuppressive conditions included HIV or a condition inducing permanent immunodeficiency ever diagnosed, or aplastic anaemia or temporary immunodeficiency recorded within the last year. Haematological malignancies were considered separately from other cancers to reflect the immunosuppression associated with haematological malignancies and their treatment.\nKidney function was ascertained from the most recent serum creatinine measurement, where available, converted into estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation, 22 with impaired kidney function defined as eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m 2 . Raised blood pressure (BP) was defined as either a prior coded diagnosis of hypertension or the most recent recording indicating systolic BP \u2265140 mmHg or diastolic BP \u226590 mmHg. Asthma was grouped by use of oral corticosteroids as an indication of severity. Diabetes was grouped according to the most recent Hba1c measurement, where a measurement was available within the last 15 months, into controlled (Hba1c < 58 mmols/mol) and uncontrolled (Hba1c >= 58 mmols/mol). Cancer was grouped by time since the first diagnosis (within the last year, 2-<5 years, >5 years).\nOther covariates considered as potential upstream risk factors were deprivation and ethnicity. Deprivation was measured by the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD, in quintiles, with higher values indicating greater deprivation), derived from the patient's postcode at lower super output area level for a high degree of precision. Ethnicity was grouped into White, Black, Asian or Asian British, Mixed, or Other. The Sustainability and Transformation Partnership (STP, an NHS administrative region) of the patient's general practice was included as an additional adjustment for geographical variation in infection rates across the country.\nInformation on all covariates were obtained from primary care records by searching TPP SystmOne records for specific coded data.

The Kaplan-Meier failure function by age group and sex are shown in figure 2. For each potential risk factor, a Cox proportional hazards model was fitted, with days in study as the timescale, stratified by geographic area (STP), and adjusted for sex and age modelled using restricted cubic splines. Violations of the proportional hazards assumption were explored by testing for a zero slope in the scaled Schoenfeld residuals. All potential risk factors, including age (again modelled as a spline), sex, BMI, smoking, index of multiple deprivation quintile, and comorbidities listed above were then included in a single multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, stratified by STP. Hazard ratios from the age/sex adjusted and fully adjusted models are reported with 95% confidence intervals. Models were also refitted with age group fitted as a categorical variable in order to obtain hazard ratios by age group.\nIn the primary analysis, those with missing BMI were assumed non-obese and those with missing smoking information were assumed to be nonsmokers on the assumption that both obesity and smoking would be likely to be recorded if present. A sensitivity analysis was run among those with complete BMI and smoking data only. Ethnicity was omitted from the main multivariable model due to 26% of individuals having missing data; hazard ratios for ethnicity were therefore obtained from a separate model among individuals with complete ethnicity only. Hazard ratios for other risk factors, adjusted for ethnicity, were also obtained from this model and are presented in the sensitivity analyses to allow assessment of the potential for confounding by ethnicity in the primary model. All multivariable models excluded the very small number of patients (<1%) with missing IMD.\nThe C-statistic was calculated as a measure of model discrimination. Due to computational time, this was estimated by randomly sampling 5000 patients without the outcome and calculating the C-statistic using the random sample and all patients who experienced the outcome, repeating this 10 times and taking the average Cstatistic.\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted May 7, 2020. to require organisations to process confidential patient information for the purposes of protecting public health, providing healthcare services to the public and monitoring and managing the COVID-19 outbreak and incidents of exposure. 41 Taken together, these provide the legal bases to link patient datasets on the OpenSAFELY platform.

Figure A1 ), equivalent to risk increasing exponentially with age. Male gender was associated with a doubling of risk (fully adjusted HR 1.99, 1.88-2.10).\nAll non-white ethnic groups had higher risk than those with white ethnicity: HRs adjusted for age and sex only ranged from 1.83-2.17 for Black, Asian/Asian British and mixed ethnicities compared to white; these attenuated to 1.62-1.71 on adjustment for all included risk factors. Increasing risks were seen with increasing levels of deprivation, and with increasing levels of obesity (BMI >40 fully adjusted HR 2.27, 95% CI 1.99-2.58).\nBoth current and former smoking were associated with higher risk in models adjusted for age and sex only, but in the fully adjusted model there was weak evidence of a slightly lower risk in current smokers (fully adjusted HRs 0.88, CI 0.79-0.99). In post-hoc analyses we added individual covariates to the model with age, sex and smoking to explore this further: the change in HR appeared to be largely driven by adjustment for chronic respiratory disease (HR 0.93, 0.83-1.04 after adjustment) and deprivation (HR 0.98, 0.88-1.10 after adjustment). Other individual adjustments did not remove the positive association between current smoking and outcome. We also explored confounding by ethnicity, which was not adjusted in the primary model: among those with complete ethnicity, the current smoking HR adjusted for all variables except ethnicity was similar to in the full study population (0.88, 0.78-1.01) but this moved towards the null on adjustment for ethnicity (HR 0.94, 0.82-1.07). .

Most comorbidities were associated with higher risk of COVID-19 hospital death, including diabetes (with a greater HR for those with recent HbA1c >= 58 mmol/mol), asthma (with a greater HR for those with recent use of an oral corticosteroid), respiratory disease, chronic heart disease, liver disease, stroke/dementia, other neurological diseases, reduced kidney function, autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus or psoriasis) and other immunosuppressive conditions, as per Table 2 . Those with a history of haematological malignancy were at >3-fold increased risk up to 5 years from diagnosis, and nearly double the risk thereafter. For other cancers, HRs were smaller and risk increases were largely observed among those diagnosed in the last year. There was no association between hypertension (defined as a recorded diagnosis, or high blood pressure at the last measurement) and outcome (HR 0.95, 0.89-1.01). However, in sensitivity analyses, diagnosed hypertension was associated with slightly increased risk (HR 1.07, 1.00-1.15) while high blood pressure (\u2265140/90 mmHg) at the most recent measurement was associated with lower risk (HR 0.61, 0.56-0.67) .\n.

The average C-statistic was 0.78. Sensitivity analyses are shown in Table A1 (appendix). Results were similar when restricted to those with complete BMI and smoking information, and when adjusted for ethnicity, among those with complete data. Violation of proportional hazards was detected in the primary model (p<0.001), so a further sensitivity analysis was run with earlier administrative censoring at 6th April 2020, since social distancing measures introduced across the UK in late March 2020 would not have been expected to impact on mortality rates at that time. There was no evidence of non-proportional hazards in this analysis (p=0.56). The overall pattern of results was similar to the primary model, though most HRs were somewhat larger in magnitude in the analysis restricted to this earlier period, while the effect of increasing deprivation appeared to be smaller (appendix Table  A1 ).\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted May 7, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.06.20092999 doi: medRxiv preprint which are now being linked on the OpenSAFELY platform.\nCensoring patients at date of death from other causes, or outside hospital, was only possible until 16th April 2020, 9 days prior to study end. Rather than ending the study earlier, greatly reducing case numbers, we end at 25 April, acknowledging that censoring would be incomplete for the last 9 days. Consequently a small number of the sickest individuals, who died after being discharged from hospital, will have remained in the \"at risk\" group over the last few days of study time when they should be censored. This would most likely apply to those with risk factors present, and therefore attenuate HRs, but any impact is likely to be small: a sensitivity analysis with all data censored at 6 April showed minimal differences.\nOur analysis to date covers 40% of the population, but may not yet be fully representative as it currently includes only practices using the EHR software SystmOne: there is substantial geographic variation in choice of EHR system and in London, where many earlier COVID-19 cases occurred, only 17% of general practices use SystmOne. Additionally it has been shown that the user interface of electronic health records can affect prescribing of certain medicines 42-44 so it is possible that coding of conditions may vary between systems; again we will evaluate this further with more data.\nPrimary care records, though detailed and longitudinal, can be incomplete for data on risk factors and other covariates. In particular, ethnicity was not recorded in approximately 26% of patients included; prior research has shown that when ethnicity is recorded in EHR its distribution is very similar to that in census ethnicity data. 45 Obesity and smoking were assumed absent if missing; patients with missing creatinine and blood pressure measurements were included in the categories denoting no evidence of reduced kidney function or high blood pressure respectively. We undertook a number of sensitivity analyses to assess robustness of these approaches, hazard ratios were similar across analyses. Deprivation score may be inaccurate for any patients without an up-to-date address, but this is unlikely to introduce a strong bias in any particular direction.\nDeviations from proportional hazards were detected. This could be partly or wholly due to the very large numbers included meaning small deviations are statistically significant, or due to unmeasured covariates. However, it may have been due to rapid changes in social behaviours following government advice on social distancing, shielding, and changes in the pattern and burden of infection across the UK, which may also have affected different patient groups differentially. A sensitivity analysis with early censoring at 6th April 2020 (before social distancing and shielding measures would be likely to affect mortality) showed no evidence of non-proportional hazards (p=0.56) and similar results to the primary model, but with larger hazard ratios for several risk factors. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the most at-risk patients may have been more compliant with social distancing and shielding policies introduced later. In contrast, the effect of increased deprivation appeared to be smaller in the earlier period, suggesting that the risk associated with deprivation may have increased over time. Subsequent analyses will explore different analytical approaches, including fitting interactions with time, and using accelerated failure time models, to further explore changes before and after national initiatives around COVID-19.\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted May 7, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.06.20092999 doi: medRxiv preprint a higher risk of death. Non-white ethnicity has previously been found to be associated with increased COVID-19 infection and poor outcomes. 12, 13, 46 Commentators and researchers have reasonably speculated that this might be due to higher prevalence of medical problems such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes among BME people, or higher deprivation. Our findings, based on more detailed data, show that this is only a small part of the excess risk. Other possible explanations for increased risk among BME groups relate to higher infection risk, including over-representation in 'front-line\" professions with higher exposure to infection, or higher household density. Addressing these questions will likely entail bespoke data collection on, for example, occupation among cases and controls.\nWe also found a consistent pattern of increasing risk with greater deprivation, with the most deprived quintile having a HR of 1.75 compared to the least deprived, consistent with recent national statistics. 47 Again, contrary to prior speculation, very little of the increased risk associated with deprivation was explained by pre-existing disease or clinical risk factors, suggesting that other social factors increase the risk of COVID-19 infection or death from infection.\nWe found increased risk for the major included co-morbidities. The ISARIC study describing 16,749 hospitalised UK patients with COVID-19 also indicated increased risk of death among hospitalised patients with cardiac, pulmonary and kidney disease, malignancy and dementia. 6 Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, respiratory disease, and cancers were all associated with increased risk of death in a large Chinese study describing 44,672 confirmed cases, but which lacked age-correction. 5 Of particular note in our results is the association of asthma with higher risk of COVID-19 hospital death, with the HR increasing further for those having a recent oral corticosteroid (indicating greater severity of disease). This contrasts with previous findings: in several countries, asthma and other chronic respiratory diseases are underrepresented in hospitalised patients; 48 and among the first few hundred cases in UK, a protective association with asthma was observed, although presence of asthma was ascertained differently for cases and controls which could be a source of bias. 36 The ISARIC study reported 14% of hospitalised patients having asthma but no increased risk of death. 6 However, in both the UK and China, COPD did appear to confer increased risk of death among hospitalised or confirmed cases, respectively. 5, 6 Our study design combines both risk of infection and risk of death once infected; it is also possible that our methodology captured more people with asthma and was better able to delineate more severe asthma than previous studies based on hospital records. We found no association between hypertension and death where hypertension was defined as a recorded diagnosis or high blood pressure at last measurement (HR 0.96, 0.9-1.02). However when separated out in sensitivity analyses diagnosed hypertension was associated with slightly increased risk, whilst a high blood pressure measurement was associated with slightly reduced risk. Hypertension is very strongly associated with age and although we adjusted for this, disentangling the effects of each is difficult.\nWe showed increasing risk of death with degree of obesity: fully-adjusted HR 1.27 for BMI 30-34.9 kg/m 2 , increasing to 2.27 for BMI >=40 kg/m 2 . Previous studies have shown increased risk with obesity among hospitalised patients: ISARIC, based on hospital survey data (2,212 deaths), found a HR of 1.37 for death associated with clinician-reported obesity among 16,749 hospitalised patients, after age and sex correction (95% CI 1.16-1.63) 6 ; obesity was also reported as a risk factor for treatment escalation in smaller studies in France and New York. 7, 8 .

We found some evidence of increased risks in former smokers. In current smokers there was a slight protective effect, which was removed when fully adjusted for ethnicity. The risks associated with smoking have been disputed, with increased risks initially reported, but some more recent reports finding that smokers are under-represented in those with more severe disease, and a potential protective mechanism for nicotine has been suggested 9,49 : smoking prevalence was lower than expected among hospitalised patients in China, 10 France 11 and the USA. 50 Even if smoking does have a small protective effects against COVID-19, this would still be massively outweighed by the well-established adverse health effects of smoking."}, {"section_title": "Information governance and ethics", "text": "NHS England is the data controller; TPP is the data processor; and the key researchers on OpenSAFELY are acting on behalf of NHS England.

Linkage to ONS allowed censoring of data in the control population for patients who had died outside hospital or from other causes. Analyses were stratified by area to account for known geographical differences in incidence of COVID-19.\nWe also identify important limitations. Using CPNS data alone relies on hospitals completing a new return under emergency conditions; furthermore COVID-19 deaths among people with false-negative tests and those untested may not have been included; we will validate CPNS against ONS data (which has a longer delay to reporting) as more cases arise. This initial analysis was focused on in-hospital death: our findings therefore reflect both an individual's risk of infection, and their risk of dying once infected. We will explore patient trajectories in future research using test results and A&E presentation data .

We were able to evaluate the association between most of these conditions and death from COVID-19, and confirm that people with these conditions do have substantially increased mortality risk, supporting the shielding strategy. We have demonstrated -for the first time -that only a small part of the substantially increased risks of death from COVID-19 among nonwhite groups and among people living in more deprived areas can be attributed to existing disease. Improved strategies to protect people in these groups from COVID-19 need urgent consideration.\nThe UK has an unusually large volume of very detailed longitudinal patient data, especially through primary care. We believe the UK has a responsibility to the global community to make good use of this data, securely, and to the highest scientific standards. OpenSAFELY demonstrates the value of this data in practice. We will enhance the OpenSAFELY platform to further inform the global response to the COVID-19 emergency."}, {"section_title": "Future Research", "text": "The underlying causes of higher risk among those from non-white backgrounds, and deprived areas, require further exploration; we would suggest collecting data on occupational exposure and living conditions as first steps. The statistical power offered by our approach means that associations with less common risk factors can be robustly assessed in more detail, at the earliest possible date, as the pandemic progresses. We will therefore update our findings and address smaller risk groups as new cases arise over time. The open source re-usable codebase on OpenSAFELY supports rapid, secure and collaborative development of new analyses: we are currently conducting expedited studies on the impact of various medical treatments and population interventions on the risk of COVID-19 infection, ITU admission, and death, alongside other observational analyses. OpenSAFELY is rapidly scalable for additional NHS patients' records, with new data sources progressing."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "We report early data on risk factors for death from COVID-19 using an unprecedented scale of 17 million patients' detailed primary care records in the context of a global health emergency; we will update our findings as new data arises.
