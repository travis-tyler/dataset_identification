Although many morphometric studies of the brain in normal and diseased states have been performed, most of them have relied on global or regional volumetric measurements. Recent developments in cortical reconstruction and mapping techniques (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) will allow a more extensive study and in-depth understanding of the cortical morphology.\nThe cerebral sulci have been of particular interest in morphometric studies during the last several years (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) for several reasons: First, the sulci are believed to form or be related to the boundaries of functional and cytoarchitectonic regions of the cortex (13, 14) , though it is questionable whether sulci can be reliably used to precisely define cytoarchitectonic and functional boundaries (15) . However, it is likely that using the major sulci to obtain better spatial normalization methods for stereotaxic analysis will improve the overlap of corresponding cytoarchitectonic cortical regions across subjects and will therefore make statistical parametric analysis (16) of structure and function more sensitive in detecting focal atrophy or functional activity. Some evidence already exists that transformations that are more flexible than the piece-wise linear Talairach transformation (17) can improve overlap of microstructurally similar regions (18) , even though the transformations used in that analysis were not flexible enough to precisely align cortical sulci to the degree that currently available methods do (7, 8, 14, 19, 20) . Moreover, in the report of Rademacher (14) , it was shown that there is a characteristic relationship between architectonic fields and sulci, gyri, and fissures.\nSecond, the shapes of the sulci are potentially related to the connectivity of the cortex. In particular, Van Essen (21) has proposed a theory of tension-based cortical folding, according to which the shapes of cortical sulci and gyri are determined in part by forces exerted by white matter fiber connections between various cortical regions. Figure 1 schematically demonstrates how the shape of a sulcus can be affected by the underlying white matter fibers. Following this hypothesis, studying the shapes of the cortical sulci is interesting from the perspective of understanding cortical morphogenesis but also from the perspective of understanding how disease or normal aging can affect cortical connectivity.\nThird, the locations and shapes of cortical sulci can be altered by brain diseases, owing to an underlying, often selective atrophy of cortical regions that might cause the relative displacement and shape change of adjacent sulci. For example, Alzheimer patients displayed higher sulcal variability in temporoparietal projection areas as well as changes in the asymmetry of the Sylvian fissure (12) .\nFourth, the sulci and gyri are natural routes to deep brain structures in certain neurosurgical procedures. In that respect, better understanding of the 3D structures of the sulci is important for image-assisted surgical plan-ning and navigation. Some investigators have pursued nonparametric representation methods for this purpose (6, 10) .\nIn this article, we present a comprehensive study of the central sulcus, using MR images from 42 right-handed normal elderly subjects. We use a previously published methodology (9) for building parametric meshes of the central sulcus from cross-sectional images. A parametric mesh effectively places a coordinate frame on the sulcal surface, thereby allowing further shape analysis. We measured the area of the central sulcus, its depth profile, its position along the anterior/posterior direction, and its curvature profile. We present interhemispheric and gender differences in all of these measures."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects and Images", "text": "MR images from 42 healthy elderly individuals (22 men and 20 women) were acquired on a GE Signa 1.5 T scanner. All subjects were participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (22, 23) . The subjects were selected from a very narrow age range to minimize age effects on our analysis; the average age was 65.6 \u00b1 2.8 years for the men and 66.6 \u00b1 3.1 years for the women. All subjects were right-handed, as determined by the 10 item Edinburgh Inventory (24) . The MR images were acquired using a 3D spoiled GRASS (SPGR) acquisition in the axial plane. Imaging parameters were as follows: TR \u202b\u05e1\u202c 35 ms, TE \u202b\u05e1\u202c 5 ms, flip angle \u202b\u05e1\u202c 45\u00b0, matrix \u202b\u05e1\u202c 256 \u00d7 256, field of view \u202b\u05e1\u202c 24 cm, 1 excitation.

Figure 2 shows a typical cross-section of a tracing of a sulcus overlaid on the corresponding MR image; tracing was performed so that the resulting surface was symmetrically positioned with respect to the opposite banks of the sulcus. With use of the method described (9) , parametric representations of the sulci were then constructed. In particular, a canonical grid was placed on each sulcus, as demonstrated in Fig. 3 . The parametric lines of this grid were stretched via an iterative algorithm (25) so that they were evenly spaced along the horizontal and the vertical lines. All horizontal parametric curves were joined in two endpoints of the parametric grid, as shown in Fig. 3 . These two endpoints lie along the outer edge of the sulcus, that is, along the exposed part of the central sulcus. One of the endpoints of the sulcus was close to the interhemispheric fissure, and the other was close to the Sylvian fissure. Since the MR images, and therefore the tracings of the sulci, were not acquired isotropically, the traced sulci were rescaled according to the voxel dimensions reported above, so that all subsequent measurements were in millimeters."}, {"section_title": "Area and Depth Measurements", "text": "Area measurements were obtained via integration along the parametric grid. More specifically, the parametric grid lines were traversed and the area of each quadrilateral patch was cumulatively added to produce a figure for the total area. Normalized differences in area were also computed as (left \u2212 right)/0.5(left + right).\nTo measure the depth of the sulcus, we developed a dynamic programming algorithm, which was already presented in detail (9) and summarized next; we will refer to this algorithm as the depth estimation algorithm (DEA). Since the depth of the sulcus varies throughout its extent, DEA considers each point along the outer \nThe area and depth measurements are quite interesting. There was a general trend for the right central sulcus to be deeper and larger than the left central sulcus in both males and females. One might expect the opposite since the left hemisphere was dominant in these subjects. However, how deep a sulcus grows might depend largely on constraints from the underlying white matter fibers. A theory that supports this hypothesis has been suggested (21) , where it was argued that axonal tension forces and the need of the brain to minimize length of connections largely shape the cortical convolutions. Under that hypothesis, an increased connectivity between juxtaposed sides of the central sulcus would tend to constrain the inward growth of the cortex and hence to reduce the depth of the central sulcus (see Fig. 1 ). Our results support this hypothesis. In particular, for fine movements of the fingers (object manipulation) and lips (speech), one would expect a relatively higher degree of connectivity between the motor and sensory cortices, which presumably is manifested by the relatively lower depth of the central sulcus in the corresponding regions along the somatotopic representation. For example, Fig. 5 shows a sharp decrease in depth somewhere around the middle of the sulcus (around index 60, in the plots of Figs. 5-7) , which is where the knob is located and where the fingers are represented (27) . This decrease in depth was characteristic in all the subjects we studied, and it is hence reflected by the average depth curves of Fig. 5 . This is an area where we expect to have the highest connectivity between the motor and sensory cortices, which would facilitate fine object manipulation. The area right below that is where the face is represented, a large part of which is devoted to the lips, also an area where we would expect a high degree of connectivity between the motor and sensory cortices, facilitating speech.\nWe should stress that our hypothesis cannot be fully supported by our current data, owing to the limited information about fiber connections that is provided by standard structural imaging protocols.

Effectively, DEA places a flexible probe on each point along the outer edge of the sulcus. The probe adapts to the curvature of the sulcus from the outer edge to the root. Therefore, the depth estimate obtained by DEA for a particular point along the outer edge of the sulcus is equal to the length of a trajectory joining that point with some point along the root of the sulcus. This latter point on the root of the sulcus is determined automatically via a dynamic programming algorithm. The cost function minimized in this dynamic programming algorithm includes two terms: The first term favors trajectories of minimal length, while the second term favors trajectories that lie on a plane that is perpendicular to the sulcus and pass through the point on which the depth is being estimated. Combined, these two terms favor paths that are orthogonal to the long axis of the sulcus, so that they resemble depth probes, and that take short paths terminating on the root of the sulcus. An example of a number of depth probes estimated this way is shown in Fig. 4A . A plot of the corresponding depth estimates is shown in Fig. 4B . We compared the depths of the left and the right central sulci in the female and the male groups with and without normalization for average depth of the sulcus. This allowed us to look at relative differences in depth estimates along the central sulcus. Statistical comparisons of depth measurements were performed via pointwise t tests on each point along the outer edge of the central sulcus, where depth measurements were obtained."}, {"section_title": "Positional Asymmetry", "text": "We measured the position of the central sulcus along the anterior/posterior direction to determine potential left/right asymmetries. Since such asymmetries might be present in certain areas along the sulcus but not in others, we obtained an asymmetry measure for each point of the parametric grid. In particular, we measured the left/right difference in the anterior/posterior direction, normalized by the total distance between the anterior-most and posterior-most points of the brain. We then calculated pointwise t tests on the points of the parametric grid to display, in a uniform way, regions that displayed significant differences; we selected a single central sulcus on which we displayed such regions color-coded. This sulcus was the average central sulcus (right hemisphere), that is, the central sulcus resulting by averaging the position of each point on the parametric grid across subjects. We colored this average sulcus by the p value of these t tests to display the regional patterns of variation. We note that the color-coded renderings of the average central sulcus   FIG. 3 .

We refer to these curvatures as k1 and k2. Because of the way that the ribbons were parameterized, the surface normal pointed in the general posterior/anterior direction. Therefore, for folds oriented roughly from anteriorly to posteriorly, such as the precentral knob (26) , the first principal curvature, k1, is the one displaying high and positive values and it is the one reflecting the degree of folding of the sulcus. Conversely, folds with the opposite orientation display very low and negative value of k2, and the absolute value of k2 reflects the degree of folding of the sulcus, around those folds. Therefore, for either type of fold, the absolute value of k1 and k2 reflects the degree of folding in the respective direction.\nTo obtain a robust curvature measurement, we used an adaptive least squares estimation procedure in which we fit a quadratic patch around each point of the central sulcus (9, 19) . The size of the patch was estimated adaptively. In particular, we used the maximum possible patch for which the error of fit of the least squares estimation procedure did not exceed a prespecified value of 1 mm. This means that the maximum, for a given approximation error, noise removal smoothing was applied, while not washing out the details of the shape of the sulcus.\nThe right central sulcus displayed, in general, higher curvature than the left central sulcus. This was the case for both the anteriorly and the posteriorly oriented folds of the sulcus and was particularly pronounced around the region of the precentral knob, the area in which the hand is believed to be represented. The pattern was very similar for men and women. Figure 11 shows the color-coded p value, overlaid on the same average sulcus, for men and women.

The observed trends are the same. However, the significance level is slightly higher for the normalized depth values, as expected, since interindividual variability in overall size was eliminated.\nWe finally measured the average depth along the central sulcus (average of the depth curves in Fig. 5 ). The average depths for the men were 21.07 mm (right hemisphere) and 20.6 mm (left hemisphere).

Red are the regions of significant interhemispheric asymmetry. These statistical maps indicate that in men, the central sulcus is located more anteriorly in the left hemisphere. This was the case for the part of the sulcus that is close to the Sylvian fissure and for the area around the knob. In women, however, the result was the opposite. In particular, the central sulcus was located more posteriorly in the left hemisphere compared with the right hemisphere. The same analysis indicated no regions of significance with either a more posterior male left central sulcus or a more anterior female left central sulcus. It is important to note that the areas that appear to be red (highest significance) in \nThere were evident position asymmetries in the central sulcus, and these asymmetries were gender dependent, as shown by Fig. 8 . We note, however, that the positional asymmetries were far less pronounced than the depth asymmetries. For the males, the right knob was more posteriorly located than the left. No significant difference was measured in the same area for females. Coupled with the fact that the curvature of the right knob was higher than the left and with the 3D displays of Fig. 9 , this implies that the fold of the area in which the hand is represented is slightly more pronounced in the right hemisphere relative to the left. One possible explanation is that a relatively larger volume of the speech parietal association (Wernicke) areas of the left hemisphere restricts the growth, or at least the folding, of the knob. Previous studies have demonstrated a larger inferior parietal lobule volume (30) , which could explain this asymmetry. Figure 9 demonstrates some of the position asymmetries very vividly.\nThe comparison of the patterns of positional asymmetries between males and females is interesting. The male trend of relatively more anterior left central sulcus, which is in agreement with the expected increased speech parietal association areas, was not present in women.

This is supported by measurements of interhemispheric connectivity via shape analysis of the corpus callosum (31). Our results are in contrast with those presented by Amunts et al. (32) , where the left central sulcus was found to be deeper in right-handed males. This discrepancy might be due to methodological differences in measuring the depth of the central sulcus or to differences in the ages of the subjects in the two studies. In particular, the methodology adopted in that work (32) measured depth from axial cross-sections oriented parallel to the anterior/posterior commissure plane. However, axial sections are not oriented along the depth of the central sulcus, particularly superiorly in the brain, which is the area where significant depth differences were found (32) . In contrast, our analysis used a 3D parametric representation of the central sulcus in conjunction with a dynamic programming algorithm, which allowed us to measure the true depth of the sulcus (see Fig. 4A ), independently of the orientation of the volumetric images. Moreover, in that work (32) , the images were transformed via a piecewise linear transformation to the Talairach space prior to obtaining the depth measurements. This standardization procedure can potentially differentially change the size of the central sulcus. For example, if the position of the central sulcus relative to the anterior commissure and posterior commissure landmarks is different, which is the case according to our anterior/posterior position measurements, then the left and right central sulci might be subjected to different scaling, which would differentially change their size. In contrast, our depth measurements were performed directly on the original data and normalized afterward, according to global size. Finally, in contrast to the work of Amunts et al. (32) , aging might differentially affect the shape of the central sulcus in men and women or in the left and right hemispheres, which would explain differences in the findings of the two studies.\nOne limitation of our study is the lack of left-handed subjects. Analysis of left-handed subjects in future studies will be particularly helpful in strengthening our hypothesis on the relationship between the local depth decrease in the knob, which is often manifested as a sulcal interruption, and increased connectivity between adjacent cortical regions. Moreover, we plan to use probabilistic maps of white matter connectivity (28) , with diffusion tensor imaging (29) , to better investigate the relationship between sulcal morphology and underlying white matter fiber pathways."}]
