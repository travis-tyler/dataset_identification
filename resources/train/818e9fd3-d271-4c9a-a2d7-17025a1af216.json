[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background Recent studies have created awareness that facial features can be reconstructed from high-resolution MRI. Therefore, data sharing in neuroimaging requires special attention to protect participants' privacy. Facial features removal (FFR) could alleviate these concerns. We assessed the impact of three FFR methods on subsequent automated image analysis to obtain clinically relevant outcome measurements in three clinical groups. Methods FFR was performed using QuickShear, FaceMasking, and Defacing. In 110 subjects of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, normalized brain volumes (NBV) were measured by SIENAX. In 70 multiple sclerosis patients of the MAGNIMS Study Group, lesion volumes (WMLV) were measured by lesion prediction algorithm in lesion segmentation toolbox. In 84 glioblastoma patients of the PICTURE Study Group, tumor volumes (GBV) were measured by BraTumIA. Failed analyses on FFR-processed images were recorded. Only cases in which all image analyses completed successfully were analyzed. Differences between outcomes obtained from FFR-processed and full images were assessed, by quantifying the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for absolute agreement and by testing for systematic differences using paired t tests.\nResults Automated analysis methods failed in 0-19% of cases in FFR-processed images versus 0-2% of cases in full images. ICC for absolute agreement ranged from 0.312 (GBV after FaceMasking) to 0.998 (WMLV after Defacing). FaceMasking yielded higher NBV (p = 0.003) and WMLV (p \u2264 0.001). GBV was lower after QuickShear and Defacing (both p < 0.001). Conclusions All three outcome measures were affected differently by FFR, including failure of analysis methods and both Brandom^variation and systematic differences. Further study is warranted to ensure high-quality neuroimaging research while protecting participants' privacy.

However, for shared data, it is crucial to protect participants' privacy. Image files should not contain identifying information such as name, date of birth, or any national or hospital-based registration numbers. Such data are often saved in metadata or even filenames of magnetic resonance (MR) images and should be removed before sharing. Unfortunately, this is not enough to alleviate privacy concerns, since typical structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides good enough skin to air contrast and spatial resolution to perform facial recognition from a 3D-rendered version of the image, whether by the human eye or using facial recognition software [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Therefore, in addition to identifying metadata, it has been suggested that facial features should also be removed, and this has been widely embraced [6] [7] [8] [9] . However, it is not yet clear whether the removal of the facial features affects subsequent measurement of quantitative indices of brain pathology.\nTherefore, the current study assessed the impact of facial features removal (FFR) on clinically relevant outcome measurements.

In addition to removing identifying metadata from MRI, facial features should also be removed. The current study evaluated how three publicly available FFR methods affect clinically relevant imaging outcome measures in AD, MS, and glioblastoma as derived using commonly used automated methods. Our results showed that the commonly used FFR methods can lead to subsequent failures of automated volumetric pipelines. Moreover, FFR can lead to substantial changes-both random (low ICC) and systematic (significant differences)-in volumes obtained by automated methods. The observed differences in outcome measures between full images and images after FFR cannot be attributed to random variation of SIENAX, LST-LPA, or BraTumIA, because the reproducibility of those methods was high. The automated methods LST-LPA for WMLV and BraTumIA for GBV failed to successfully execute on multiple FFR-processed images. It should be mentioned that we applied the automated methods with their default settings and did not attempt to remedy the errors. We did, however, assess the failures and we suspect that the failures were related to image registration steps, because registration methods can be susceptible to (disease related) artifacts as recently highlighted by Dadar et al [30] . This recent study showed that registration used in the automated methods could have problems with higher levels of noise and non-uniformity in images and that head size could have an effect on registration methods. It is conceivable that if the face is removed or deformed, the level of noise and non-uniformity could change and lead to failures.\nThe possible importance of image registration in causing changes after FFR is further suggested by the higher variability of NBV compared with BV after FFR. To compute the Only the images for which FFR was successful and for which the segmentation was successful are included ICC, intra-class correlation coefficient; n, number of subjects; AD, Alzheimer's disease Table 5 Lesion volume in the MS dataset and tumor volume in the glioblastoma dataset. From left to right, the table lists median [1st and 3rd quartiles] for volumes; Bonferroni-corrected p values for the pairwise comparison of volumes from FFR-processed and full images; volume differences between the full and FFR-processed images as mL and % differences (median [1st and 3rd quartiles]); ICC (absolute agreement (lower-upper band of 95% CI)) between volumes from full and FFR-processed images; Dice's similarity index between segmentation from full and FFR-processed images; false negative between segmentations from full and FFR-processed images; and false positive between segmentations from full FFR-processed images MS; lesion (n = 55) Volume (mL) NBV, SIENAX multiplies the BV (calculated in native subject space) by a volumetric scaling factor obtained from a linear registration of the brain image to a standard brain image, additionally using a derived skull image. FFR could affect the removal of non-brain tissue and identification of the skull, and thereby cause a different registration result, culminating in altered NBV values. Differences in shapes of the head and face between people (related to, e.g., sex or ethnicity) may affect performance of standard FFR algorithms which may have ramifications especially for subsequent analysis methods Fig. 4 Scatter plots of the normalized brain volume (a), brain volume (b), white matter lesion volume (c), and glioblastoma volume (d). The facial removal datasets are plotted against the full scan; QuickShear, blue diamond; FaceMasking, red cross; and Defacing, green plus sign. All scatter plots have an identity line indicating perfect agreement. NBV, normalized brain volume; BV, brain volume; FFR, facial features removal; WMLV, white matter lesion volume; GBV, tumor volume; mL, milliliter; L, liter that use the skull such as SIENAX. However, there are also cases in which the NBV was not affected by FFR, so maybe there is a cutoff on how much of the head can be removed without affecting the NBV measurement. In a further study, an optimum could be determined between the amount of facial features that should be removed for de-identification and the amount that should remain for correct analyses with automated methods. Therefore, it would be interesting to study in more detail the effect of FFR methods on registration and other processing steps in a systematic way. Milchenko and Marcus [13] and Bischoff-Grethe et al [14] both addressed the effects of their FFR method on skull stripping; however, it would be interesting to analyze the effects of these methods on other processing steps as well as multiple skull stripping methods, all in the same dataset for an objective comparison. Next, to remedy those errors, analysis methods and processing steps should be made robust against the absence or distortion of facial features. As an example, facial features could be removed from fixed reference images in registration steps or in reference templates (e.g., of tissue probabilities) in image processing pipelines. Moreover, it would also be helpful to study if changing the default settings of the automated methods improves the segmentation.\nThe measured volumes of the automated methods are affected-both random (low ICC) and systematic (significant differences). The random effects are mostly visible in the volume change of the NBV and GBV after FFR processing and the significant differences are visible in the volume change of BV and GBV. The Bland-Altman plots show that the volume changes are not dependent on the measured volumes. FFR affects not only the measured volumes of the automated methods but also the extent and precise spatial location of the WML and the glioblastomas, as demonstrated by the overlap analyses. For the WML in MS, median FP and FN fractions ranged between about 10 and 25% of the median total WMLV. Similar effects were observed for glioblastoma, with median FN fractions between about 15 and 20%, and median FP fractions between about 6 and 9%. Both the volumetric and spatial results indicate that the differences between full image segmentations and FFR-processed segmentations are substantial. This is unexpected, especially for LV and GBV, as given that both the MS lesions and the glioblastoma are located within the region occupied by brain tissue that should not be, and judging from our visual inspections indeed was not, affected by the FFR methods. Both in MS and glioblastoma, the exact location and extent of pathological changes are of importance; therefore, these artifactual post FFR segmentation changes should be investigated in more detail and methods should be devised and tested to mitigate these effects.\nOur results showed that the effects of FFR on current methods are a common problem across domains: brain volumes, MS lesion volumes, and glioblastoma volumes were all to some degree affected by FFR. The next step would be to investigate how to overcome such issues for SIENAX, LST-LPA, and BraTumIA, or in a broader sense, to study and mitigate sources of error after FFR for multiple methods aimed at brain volume, MS lesion, or glioblastoma segmentation. Another option would be to consider removing the facial features from fixed reference images in registration steps or in reference templates (e.g., of tissue probabilities) in image processing pipelines.\nIt should be noted that in this study, we did not test if the FFR methods indeed made the participant unrecognizable. However, we observed that the FFR methods in some cases seemed to leave parts of the face intact. We did not assess whether this made the person recognizable, because this would require a more rigorous setup outside the scope of this study. However, it would be important to establish guidelines on how to make participants unrecognizable, specifically which parts of the face should be removed or otherwise processed to ensure participants' privacy. Moreover, for protecting participants' privacy, it may be important to take into account that reconstruction of removed or deformed facial features may be possible [31] .\nIn conclusion, this study highlighted a new challenge to the neuroimaging research community, which is to ensure highquality neuroimaging research while protecting participants' privacy. Our results demonstrate that facial features removal of brain MRI can lead both to failure of automated analysis methods (mostly by LST-LPA and BraTumIA) and to changes in volumes obtained by the analysis methods, including both Brandom^variation (mostly by NBV and GBV) and systematic differences (mostly by BV and GBV). Therefore, volumetric image analysis methods need to be carefully assessed and optimized with regard to FFR methods, in order to ensure the reliability of clinical research outcomes while protecting participants' privacy in multicentric, collaborative studies. This could be done by improving image registration accuracy after FFR, addressing in more detail the effect of FFR methods on other processing steps or by developing methods that are tailored to images from which facial features have been removed.\nInformed consent Written informed consent was obtained for primary studies from all subjects (patients) in this study.\nEthical approval Institutional Review Board approval was obtained for primary studies.
