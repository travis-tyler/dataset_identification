It is now a 55 serious pandemic threat and international public health concern according to World Health 56 Organization (WHO). Till May 20, 2020, around 213 countries and territories have been 57 affected by SARS-CoV-2 and ~5 million people infected with more than 334 thousand 58 deaths. The SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV supposed to be originated from bat through an 59 intermediate animal host [19] [20] [21] . MERS-CoV-2 has been reported having zoonotic transmission patients. In this review, we summarized the SARS-CoV-2 infected animal cases and recent 69 researches conducted in this field.
