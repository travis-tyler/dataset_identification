[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "OBJECTIVES: To examine differences in the relationship between fat distribution and lipid coronary risk factors in Caucasian and Japanese population and further to determine whether the cut-points for body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) proposed by WHO and NHLBI are applicable to Japanese population as a predictor of a lipid risk factor abnormality or not. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Subjects were 895 participants of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging in the US (BLSA) and 1705 participants of the Longitudinal Study of Aging by the National Institutes for Longevity Science in Japan (NILS-LSA). Subjects were divided into four demographic groups as younger (ageo65 y) men and women, and older (ageZ65 y) men and women. Blood total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-and HDL-cholesterol and anthropometry were measured. Regression coefficients of BMI and WC on risk factors, sensitivity and specificity of the BMI and WC cut-points for blood lipid abnormality, and mean values of blood lipids at BMI or WC cut-points were computed in both populations. RESULTS: Height, weight, WC and BMI were significantly greater in the BLSA than those in the NILS-LSA subjects. Total cholesterol, HDL-and LDL-cholesterol were significantly greater in the NILS-LSA than in the BLSA subjects. Sensitivities of BMI and WC cut-points were much lower in the NILS-LSA than in the BLSA subjects. Specificities of BMI and WC cut-points were higher in the NILS-LSA than in the BLSA subjects. Mean values of triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-and LDL-cholesterol at BMI \u00bc 25 were significantly greater in the NILS-LSA than in the BLSA subjects. At the WC cut-point (94 cm for men, 80 cm for women), mean values of all lipids were significantly greater in the NILS-LSA than in the BLSA subjects with the exception of triglycerides in younger women. CONCLUSIONS: The Japanese subjects have smaller BMI and WC, worse total and LDL-cholesterol levels and better HDLcholesterol levels compared to Caucasians. Sensitivities of BMI and WC for predicting lipid risk factor abnormality are much lower in Japanese. The cut-points for BMI and WC proposed by WHO and NHLBI may be too high for predicting an abnormality in triglycerides, total and LDL-cholesterol in Japanese. For detecting an abnormal HDL-cholesterol level, the BMI and WC cutpoints may not be as beneficial for the Japanese population as for Caucasians."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The prediction and prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) are of great importance, especially in industrial countries. The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) 1 recommended that a fasting lipoprotein profile (total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride) should be obtained once every 5 y in all adults aged 20 y or older. LDL-cholesterol was defined as the primary target of cholesterol-lowering therapy. Therefore, detecting an abnormality in blood lipids and initiating early treatment is essential to decrease the incidence of CHD.\nIt has been established that obesity, especially central distribution of body fat, is associated with many chronic diseases. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Although imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) have been the 'gold standard' methods for quantification of visceral fat, these methods are inconvenient and costly for routine clinical use. Therefore, several surrogates of intra-abdominal fat measurement have been examined. [7] [8] [9] The body mass index (BMI) has long been used as a convenient, useful index of overweight and obesity. Studies have shown that waist circumference (WC) could be used to predict risk factor abnormalities as a surrogate of body fat distribution. [9] [10] [11] Han et al 12 indicated the linear relationship between WC and intra-abdominal fat. The World Health Organization (WHO) 6 and the National Heart, Lung, and\nBlood Institute (NHLBI) 5 issued comprehensive recommendations for classifying abnormalities in body weight and body fat distribution. Both reports recommended the BMI and the WC as measures of obesity and fat distribution, and concluded that risk of disease increases at a BMI of 25 kg/m 2 in both men and women; the WHO report noted increased risk at a WC of 94 cm for men and 80 cm for women. It has been well known that obesity and fat distribution are influenced by complex factors including social, behavioral, cultural, physiological, metabolic and genetic factors. Differences in the relationships among BMI, WC and waist-hip ratio (WHR) in 19 populations, including Beijing Chinese, were reported by Molarius et al. 13 They concluded that the optimal screening cutoff point of WC and BMI may be population specific. Also, Hu et al 14 showed that a rural\nChinese population in developing countries has a different relationship between BMI and CHD from Western populations. However, NHLBI and WHO reports did not propose population-specific cut-points for either BMI or WC.\nAlthough it was shown that the cut-points proposed by WHO and NHLBI for BMI and WC were useful predictors for coronary risk factors in Caucasian younger and older men and women in our previous studies, 15, 16 it is still not clear whether or not these cut-points are applicable to relatively short stature and lighter weight populations in an industrial country such as Japan.\nThe purposes of the present study are (1) to examine the relationship between plasma lipid coronary risk factors and indices of body composition (BMI and WC) in Caucasian and Japanese populations; (2) to test whether recently proposed cut-points of BMI and WC can be applied to the younger and older Japanese population as well as to Caucasians."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "The subjects of this study consisted of 566 men and 329 women who participated in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) in USA, and 868 men and 837 women who participated in the National Longevity Sciences-Longitudinal Study of Aging (NILS-LSA) in Japan.

In all cases, the regressions were negative, but the impact of the body composition variables was greater in the NILS population; in five of the eight regressions, these differences were statistically significant. These population differences were especially striking in the younger men and women. There was also a consistent very large effect of both BMI and WC on the triglyceride levels, but there were no significant differences in the slope between the two populations. The only other statistically significant slope differences were WC-total cholesterol in the younger women and WC-LDL-cholesterol in the older men, but these population differences were inconsistent in the other three demographic (age/sex) groups ( Table 2) .\nPercentage of subjects with an abnormal risk factor status Table 3 shows the percentages of subjects with an abnormal level of BMI, WC or risk factors for each age/sex group in the BLSA and NILS-LSA subjects.

Consistent with these population differences, there was a significantly higher percentage of subjects with an abnormal HDLcholesterol level in the BLSA than that in the NILS subjects in all age/sex groups.

Also, the sex-specific WHO cut-points for WC that provided three zones (NHLBI standards provided two zones) were also found to be applicable to the risk factors in the four age-sex categories in Caucasians. However, it was pointed out that the BMI and/or WC in Asian populations are much lower than those in Caucasians. 22 Therefore, the important questions that remain are whether BMI and/or WC associated with coronary risk factors in relatively short and light-weight Asian populations as well as in Caucasians, and whether the BMI and WC cut-points proposed by NHLBI and WHO are applicable to Asian populations as a predictor of risk factor abnormality.\nIn the present study, in order to examine these questions, the relationship between BMI, WC and lipid risk factors (regression) and the applicability (sensitivity, specificity) of the BMI and WC cut-points for these risk factors were compared between the BLSA (Caucasian) and the NILS-LSA subjects (Japanese).\nHeight, weight and BMI were lower in the NILS-LSA than in the BLSA subjects regardless of the age/sex groups. There was a methodological difference in the measurement of WC between BLSA and NILS-LSA (see the Methods section). Although the minimal circumferences between the lower edge of the rib cage and the iliac crests were measured as WC in the BLSA subjects, the circumference at the middle point between the lower edge of the rib cage and the iliac crests was measured in the NILS-LSA subjects. Therefore, the measured WC in the NILS-LSA subjects may not be minimal as was the BLSA measurement. Despite this, WC in the NILS-LSA is still much smaller than that in the BLSA. In addition, WC of the NILS-LSA subjects was as highly correlated to BMI and to lipids as WC of the BLSA subjects (data not shown). Therefore, we compared the data of WC between the BLSA and the NILS-LSA directly.\nIt is well known that greater BMI or WC results in higher lipid risk factor levels. However, Japanese subjects (NILS-LSA) had higher levels in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol with smaller weight, BMI and WC, compared to Caucasians (BLSA). This result may indicate that associations between BMI, WC and lipid levels in Japanese differ from those in Caucasians. In the present study, the relationship (slope of regression) between BMI, WC and total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol was similar, with the exception of the relationship between WC and LDL-cholesterol in older men, and between WC and total cholesterol in younger women. However, relationships between BMI, WC and HDLcholesterol in most demographic groups were different in the two populations. Although relationships between BMI, WC and risk factors (triglycerides, total and LDL-cholesterol) were similar in the two populations, the mean values of total and LDL-cholesterol, and the percentages of subjects with an abnormal level of total and LDL-cholesterol in the NILS-LSA were higher than the levels of these variables in the BLSA subjects. In addition, the mean values at the BMI and WC cut-points in triglycerides, total and LDL-cholesterol were also higher (worse) in the NILS-LSA than those in the BLSA subjects. The mean plasma lipids are different between Japanese and Caucasians, although Japanese and Caucasians have similar relationships between BMI, WC and triglycerides, total and LDL-cholesterol. Because Japanese have higher levels of plasma lipids (excepting HDL-cholesterol) with a smaller BMI and WC, a normal BMI and WC defined by WHO and NHLBI does not indicate a lower risk in triglycerides, total and LDL-cholesterol in the Japanese population. The BMI and WC cutoff points seem to be too high as a predictor of risk abnormality to detect an abnormality in triglycerides, total and LDL-cholesterol for the Japanese population. Present data of very low sensitivities of the BMI and WC cut-points in the NILS-LSA support these results. For example, 83% of older men in the NILS-LSA who had an abnormal total cholesterol level had a normal Racial differences in risk factors and fat distribution N Iwao et al BMI, and 89.4% older men in the NILS-LSA with an abnormal total cholesterol had a normal WC. Thus, the cut-points for BMI and WC proposed by WHO and NHLBI may not be ideal or even useful predictors of risk abnormality in the Japanese population. If these cutoff points of abnormality for BMI and WC are defined at lower levels, they may become a useful index for the Japanese population because BMI and WC still correlate with lipid risk factors in the Japanese subjects (data not shown). Further examinations are needed for the selection of the specific cutoff points for BMI and WC in the Japanese population.\nIn the present study, different relationships between BMI, WC and HDL-cholesterol in the two populations were found in most demographic groups. Although the magnitudes of the decrease in HDL-cholesterol with the increases of BMI and WC were greater in the NILS-LSA than in the BLSA subjects, mean values of HDL-cholesterol at the BMI and WC cut-points were still greater (better) in the NILS-LSA subjects. In the present study, there was a difference in the lipid methodologies between the two populations (see the Methods section). However, accuracy of both methods has been certified by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In addition, mean HDL-cholesterol levels were very similar in the BLSA and NHANES III, 23 and also in NILS-LSA and the National Nutrition Survey (Japan). 24 Therefore, we do not believe that these significant differences in HDL-cholesterol between BLSA and NILS-LSA subjects were caused by the methodological difference in HDL-cholesterol measurement. Thus, we compared HDLcholesterol levels between BLSA and NILS-LSA subjects directly. Our result shows that the Japanese population with a normal BMI or WC has a remarkably higher level of HDLcholesterol. NCEP noted that a high HDL-cholesterol level appears to be protective against CHD, and a level of Z60 mg/ dl can even be called 'a negative risk factor'. The mean values of HDL-cholesterol at the BMI cut-point in the Japanese population were 54, 53, 64 and 60 mg/dl in younger men, older men, younger women and older women, respectively. And the mean values of HDL-cholesterol at the WC cut-point were 49, 51, 63 and 61 mg/dl in these groups. Mean HDLcholesterol levels in Japanese women were close to being 'a negative risk factor', even if their BMI levels exceeded 25 kg/ m 2 or their WC levels exceeded 80 cm.\nFrom our results, it may seem that the BMI and WC cutpoints proposed by WHO and NHLBI are at levels too low for detecting HDL-cholesterol abnormality in the NILS-LSA subjects. However, it should be taken into account that most Japanese have relatively small BMI and WC (percentage of subjects with an abnormal BMI and WC in the four age/sex groups are only 5-29). If cut-points of BMI and WC are set at higher levels, almost no Japanese will have an 'abnormal' WC or BMI. In this Japanese population, lowering the cutpoints for BMI or WC will provide very low specificity and rising the cut-points will yield very low sensitivity. The only other solution would be to redefine the level of HDLcholesterol abnormality for the Japanese population.\nAccumulation of intra-abdominal fat has been shown to be associated with risk factor abnormalities.\n3,25,26 Although we did not quantify intra-abdominal fat using CT scans in the present study, the distribution of intra-abdominal fat might well be different in the two populations. This may underlie the fact that the BMI and WC cut-points do not have the same level of applicability for predicting risk abnormality in Caucasian and Japanese populations. Therefore, further study is needed to better understand the relation between abdominal fat distribution (CT scan) and risk factor abnormality; it should however be noted that Takami et al  27 reported that BMI and WHR are better predictors of metabolic abnormalities than abdominal fat measured by CT. Also, the reason for the differences in blood lipids between the Japanese and Caucasian populations was beyond the scope of the present study. Diet, exercise, body composition or genetics might be expected to contribute to these differences. [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] In the present study, there was an interesting finding that correlations between BMI, WC and lipids (total and LDLcholesterol) in older people were weak or not significant regardless of populations, although BMI and WC were still highly correlated with triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol in older people. We have previously reported the effects of age on the relationship between body composition and risk factors in Caucasians 15, 16, 33 and these effects are also seen in the Japanese population.\nIn conclusion, the Japanese subjects have higher total and LDL-cholesterol levels with smaller mean BMI and WC measurements compared to Caucasians. Although mean values in triglycerides, total and LDL-cholesterol at the recommended cut-points of BMI and WC (BMI \u00bc 25 kg/m 2 , WC \u00bc 94 cm for men 80 cm for women) are obviously high (worse) in the Japanese, the mean HDL-cholesterol level at the cut-point is higher (ie, better) in Japanese. Thus, these cutpoints for BMI and WC proposed by WHO and NHLBI may be too high for predicting an abnormality in triglycerides, total and LDL-cholesterol in Japanese. Predicting an abnormal HDLcholesterol level using the cut-points for BMI and WC may not be as beneficial for the Japanese population as for Caucasians.\nIt must be noted that direct analyses of the predictive power of the cut-points for BMI and WC on the development of CHD itself in Japanese and Caucasian populations would be instructive, since the variables examined are risk factors for CHD in the present study. We must also note that direct examinations of the relationship among the characteristics in plasma lipids, nutrition intake, and morbidity and mortality of CHD in the Japanese and Caucasians are desirable in future studies."}]
