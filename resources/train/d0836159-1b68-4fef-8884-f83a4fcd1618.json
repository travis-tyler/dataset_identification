[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "To examine the rate of weight gain over time among Americans by age, gender, and race. PARTICIPANTS: Scientific sample of 5117 Americans, ages 25-74 y in 1971 followed for 20 y. RESULTS: Rates of weight gain estimated by mixed effects models are highest among young adults and rates of weight loss are greatest among older adults. The overall shape of the growth curves are similar for men and women, black and white, in terms of both weight gain and weight loss. Rates are also affected by baseline body mass index (BMI \u00bc wt in kg/height in m 2 ). CONCLUSIONS: Americans gain weight until middle age, stabilize, and begin to lose weight near age 60. Weight loss during old age is especially evident for obese Americans. The ability to accurately identify groups with increased risk and target them for obesity prevention will help combat the steady rise of overweight and obesity in America."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Obesity is the number one health problem in the US 1 and it has been worsening. 2 While more and more Americans are being classified as obese, little is known about the pattern of weight change in individuals during the adult years. Who is gaining weight? When are they gaining? Are the rates the same for everyone at all ages, for men as for women? Are the rates similar for black and white Americans? Answers to these questions could identify who is at risk and when. While most studies of weight gain in the US population have been cross-sectional, this study models the pattern of weight gain for adult men and women longitudinally. From cross-sectional surveys of the US population conducted between 1960 and 1994, Flegal et al described a trend toward increasing overweight and obesity in the population, with obesity defined by a Body mass index (BMI) 425 kg/m 2 , similar for all age, gender, and racial-ethnic groups with an overall overweight and obesity prevalence of 54.9%. 2 In a cross-sectional study of Canadians, Mueller et al concluded that general fatness in both men and women increases with age up to 65, and then begins to decline. 3 While cross-sectional studies are useful to describe weight change in the general population over time, only longitudinal studies can estimate rates of change. Both Guo et al and Chumlea et al reported on findings from the Fels Longitudinal study that men and women were gaining weight up to age 65. 4, 5 Shimokata, in a 5 y longitudinal follow-up of participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging also reported weight gain until about age 65 and weight loss thereafter. 6 Williamson et al reported from the first National Health Examination Follow-up Study (NHEFS) of American men and women that the largest increase in weight occurs between the ages of 25 and 44 for both men and women and that those over 60 years of age show a loss of weight. 7 Cornoni-Huntley et al studied change in weight for those in the first NHEFS as well, splitting the subjects into quintiles of BMI. 8 They found that younger persons in the lower quintiles at baseline gained more than those in the higher quintiles and older persons in the highest quintile at baseline have the greatest loss in weight. The estimates from the third and fourth waves of the NHEFS included in this paper should extend the work described above. This paper will estimate rates of change for weight over a 20 y period for subjects who were aged 25-74 at baseline and will address age, BMI, race, and gender as possible contributors to these estimates. This study provides the most comprehensive description of weight gain among adult Americans over a 20-y period."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Subjects were 5117 men and women from the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I), who were 25-74 y old at baseline beginning in 1971 and were surveyed again beginning in 1982, 1987, and 1992 as part of the NHEFS. The first follow-up study was performed in the homes of the participants, and weight was measured on uniform scales. In the remaining follow-up surveys, subjects were asked to report their current weight during a telephone interview. Each participant was followed for 20 y as the cohort aged from 25 to 74 y of age at baseline to 45-94 at the fourth follow-up. Since the time interval between surveys varied for individuals, the subject's age at the time of each survey is the major independent variable in this study.\nNHEFS classified subjects as Aleutian, Eskimo or American Indian, Asian/Pacific islander, black, white, and other. There were 5165 subjects who had useable data at each of the four time points for each variable of interest, including 4519 white and 598 black subjects, 14 Aleutian, Eskimo or American Indians, 34 Asian/Pacific islanders, and no others. Owing to small sample sizes, the Aleutian, Eskimo or American Indian and Asian/Pacific islander subjects were eliminated from all analyses, leaving a sample of 5117 black and white subjects who were analyzed separately.\nSince it was postulated that people gain weight most rapidly when they are young, stabilize for a while, and then begin to lose weight as they grow older, the sample of 5117 was divided into four age groups, first by dividing the sample into three age groups of equal size. The youngest group, ages 25-35 at their initial interview, consisted of 1837 subjects, 532 men and 1305 women. The second age group consisted of 1605 subjects, 498 men and 1107 women, who were aged 36 to 47 at their initial interview. The third age group is 1675 subjects, 611 men and 1064 women, who were 48-74 at initial interview. This third age group contains roughly the same number of subjects but spans 26 y instead of 10 Statistical analyses were performed separately by gender and race, first descriptively with tables to show the crude growth rates for black and white men and women by age groups, and then by fitting growth models to provide refined statistical estimates of growth rate. Growth models were fit by gender and race to estimate the effects of age, age squared, and age cubed. These models provide more accurate estimates of overall rates of weight change than the crude growth rates estimated from the descriptive statistics, but more importantly they test for nonlinearity. If men and women gain weight up to about age 60 and then begin to lose weight, these models will detect that nonlinearity.\nA second set of growth models were fit to estimate the rates of growth within each combination of age and BMI category, 24 models for white men and 24 for white women. Examining these estimates reveals precisely how rates of weight change vary within each BMI and age category. The sample of 598 black subjects, 157 men and 441 women, was too small to conduct such detailed analyses for black subjects.\nThe fitted models were mixed effects models containing both fixed and random effects. 11 The mixed effects models treated age as random for each subject. Random-effects models allow individual subjects to have their own intercepts and slopes, and these provide more precise modeling for longitudinal weight changes. For example, when considering age as a random effect, two subjects with the same age can have different body weight changes in the model, which is more precise and realistic than a fixed effects model where every subject has the same change in body weight at the same age. Another advantage of using a random-effects model is the flexibility of the covariate structure available for missing data or unbalanced design. In this study, the random effects model can separate between-subject variations from longitudinal changes. When these models relating age and weight are fit, the intercept estimates weight at age zero. Therefore time was centered on the mean age, which gives the intercept more meaning but leaves the slope unchanged.\nTo address the possibility that a small number of persons who experienced extreme weight changes contributed excessively to these models, Cook's Distance was calculated. Cook's Distance is a statistic that combines studentized residuals and leverage values to flag extreme observations, which are defined as having a value of Cook's Distance greater than or equal to one. This allows investigation of the possibility that some extreme subjects are causing significant changes in the estimated growth rates. 12 Linear, quadratic, and cubic mixed effects models were fit using both the LME function in S-PLUS 13 and Proc Mixed in SAS. 14 Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) was used to compare linear mixed effects models for each subgroup to models, which also included age-squared. AIC is a fit index reflecting goodness of fit, which accounts for parsimony by penalizing for overparamaterization. If the AIC value for the overall quadratic model is closer to zero than the AIC for the "}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Descriptions of the crude weight changes are shown in Table 1 . Weight change has been defined as the weight at the end minus weight at the beginning of the study. Table 1 shows the observed change in average weight as well as crude rates of change by race, gender, and age categories. Weight increases more rapidly for both men and women in the first two age categories. White women 25-35 at baseline gained 7.7 kg over a 20-y period, or 0.39 kg/y, while men gained 7.3 kg or 0.36 kg/y. The youngest black women gained 10.9 kg, while the younger black men gained 8.2 kg, or 0.54 and 0.41 kg/y, respectively. White men and women 36-47 at baseline gained 4.5 kg, or 0.23 kg/y. Black men and women 36-47 y old at baseline showed similar trends as the white subjects, with a 5.0 kg gain for women and 4.5 kg gain for men, or 0.25 and 0.23 kg/y, respectively. White men and women 48-60 y old at baseline leveled off, with the men gaining 0.5 kg, or 0.02 kg/y, and women gaining 0.9 kg, or a 0.05 kg/y. Black women in the 48-60 age group were already losing weight, while the white women were stable. Black women lost 5.0 kg, or 0.25 kg/y, while black men gained 2.7 kg, or 0.14 kg/y. White men and women in the 61-74 age group lost 2.7 and 5.9 kg, respectively, or 0.14 and 0.29 kg/y. The black men and women lost 0.9 and 7.3 kg, respectively, or 0.05 kg/y and 0.36 kg/y. This analysis suggests that the point at which Americans stop gaining and begin to lose weight is near age 60. Black women show a more extreme pattern of gain: gaining weight faster while young, losing weight faster when older, and beginning to lose weight earlier than white women. In general, weight gains are highest for the first two age categories while weight losses are highest for the last two age categories. Table 2 contains the parameter estimates from fitting mixed models for each race and gender. The models estimate weight change as a function of age, age squared, and age cubed. As mentioned earlier, age has been mean centered prior to analysis. The estimates in Table 2 are fixed effects, although each subject has an individual random intercept and slope that are not included in the table. The estimated effects are consistently positive for age and negative for age squared, with age cubed significant for white women only.\nWhile Table 2 contains estimates of the fixed effects part of the mixed model, the predicted weights from the combined significant fixed effects and random effects models are graphed in Figure 1 . The squiggled lines combine the fixed effects and random effects estimates of predicted weights, which are smoothed using the local linear regression option in SPSS interactive graphics. 16 Although the overall shapes of the smoothed graphs appear similar for men and women, both black and white, the variation is greater among black subjects, especially black men who have the smallest sample sizes, 441 women, and 157 men. The graphs show weight gains until age 50 or 60 and weight losses thereafter for all groups, and demonstrate the nonlinear effects of age on all groups. It is clear from Table 2 and Figure 1 that the rate of weight change varies with age and is nonlinear. To clarify how weight change varies with age, while also examining how weight might change with BMI level as reported by CornoniHuntley et al, 8 additional analyses were performed, dividing white men and women into the four age categories and six BMI categories described earlier. The samples of black men and women were too small to conduct such detailed analyses. Thus, with four age categories and six BMI Rates of weight change TJ Sheehan et al categories, 24 separate models were fit for white men and women. Table 3 contains the estimates relating changes in weight to age and age-squared for each combination of age and BMI category. The models shown are those with the best AIC. In all, 11 of the 48 models contain estimates for age that are not significant at the 5% level with four of the 11 occurring among the obese in the first two age categories, indicating a lack of evidence for any significant weight gain for obese men and women in the first two age categories. In fact, for obese women in the youngest age group, 25-35 years old at baseline, there is a negative effect for age squared, \u00c00.02, suggesting a statistically significant weight loss over the 20 y study period. For all other BMI categories in the first two age categories, men and women show their highest rates of weight gain. The growth rates in Table 3 are generally higher for the younger age groups, and show a trend toward slower rates with increasing BMI categories, with no significant growth among obese men or women. The rates have slowed for women in the 48-60 age group; they remain significantly positive for the first three BMI categories, but also show a trend toward significantly negative age-squared effects indicating the start of weight loss by the end of follow-up for the 48-60 age group. The highest BMI category has a significant negative effect for age and a negative effect for age squared suggesting the declines for the highest BMI levels in the third age group. For women in the oldest age category the continuing decline with age is clearly seen, with significant negative estimates for age and age squared and Rates of weight change TJ Sheehan et al rates of decline increasing as BMI categories increase. The estimates suggest that women in the higher BMI groups begin to lose weight earlier than those in the lower BMI groups. Similar trends are present for men. The highest BMI group stabilizes the earliest, with nonsignificant age effects across the first two age groups, which turn negative for the third age group, ages 48-60 at baseline. The lowest BMI group, on the other hand, is continuing to show significant positive age effects into the 48-60 age group and levels off in the 61-74 age group. Figure 2 graphs the overall estimates of the mixed effects models presented in To address the issue of whether extreme observations were unduly influencing the estimates, especially for models with small sample sizes, Cook's Distance was calculated. All subjects had values of Cook's Distance below one at all time points. The highest value of Cook's Distance was 0.296, and only three of the 20 468 observations had a Cook's Distance greater than 0.10, suggesting that extreme observations are not a concern here."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Of the longitudinal studies of weight change available that we are aware of, this study uses data on the largest sample followed for the longest time. The follow-up period of 20 y tracks changes in weight for 5117 subjects who were between the ages of 25 and 74 at the start and who were between the ages of 45 and 95 y of age at the finish. The use of linear and quadratic mixed models provided estimates for weight change overall. When graphs of the fitted models are shown together in Figure 1 , a nonlinear pattern emerges for all groups accelerating upward, leveling off, and turning downward around age 60.\nThe use of categories of BMI has allowed for the possibility that obese Americans are not gaining or losing weight at the same time and rate as others. The data show that obese men and women change the least before age 60 and then lose weight more rapidly than others after age 60.\nThese models suggest that the greatest risk for weight gain occurs during young adulthood. Since obesity is such a health hazard, targeting men and women between the ages of 25 and 50 for weight management could be the most productive. There is a need for effective obesity prevention at younger ages, as many Americans are already obese by age Rates of weight change TJ Sheehan et al 25. At the older end of the spectrum there is also concern. Although weight loss is often considered beneficial to health, the weight loss among older adults may be due to the loss of lean body mass, even while fat mass increases or remains the same. 17 For women especially, losses in bone mineral density can be particularly dangerous and possibly lead to osteoporosis; for both men and women, the loss of muscle mass can signal loss of strength and stability leading to greater risks for disability."}]
