[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The toolbox of methods for climate change vulnerability assessment (CCVA) for natural resources-from individual species to habitats to places (e.g., protected areas, watersheds, landscapes)-continues to grow as new approaches are developed, tested, and applied. The purpose of this document is to provide a non-comprehensive survey of some of the principal CCVA methods in use today for: (1) species; (2) habitats; (3) places (protected areas, watersheds, landscapes); (4) ecosystem processes; (5) ecosystem services; (6) water resources; and (7) coastal resources. Case study examples are presented for as many of the methods as possible. Most of the text is taken directly from the abstract or methods section of the article/report cited. This toolbox does not provide an evaluation of the pros and cons of methods, but simply provides a description of each method and case study to provide the reader with sufficient information to: (1) decide if further investigation of a tool or case study is warranted; and (2) find additional resources about that tool/case study. Deciding which tool to use is not always simple or straightforward, and depends on factors including the management question being asked, the target natural resource or resources, the staff and financial resources available, the level of stakeholder participation desired, the desired level of confidence in the results, and other factors. Readers should consult the comprehensive publication Scanning the Conservation Horizon (Glick et al. 2011; http://www.habitat.noaa.gov/pdf/scanning_the_conservation_horizon.pdf), for an introduction to climate change vulnerability assessment and questions to ask in deciding which tool to use. The goal is to regularly update the Toolbox as new methods and case studies are published. To be effective, this needs to be a living document. We welcome input from readers regarding different methods and case studies, as well as any published evaluations of methods. Please send information on additional tools and case studies to Kurt A.

Each approach has strengths and limitations. Using the two together can be a fruitful approach, especially if a large suite of species is under consideration. In such an analysis, a coarse-filter approach would first be used to identify a suite of species considered vulnerable to climate change. Then a fine-filter, modeling approach would be used to identify species-specific vulnerabilities and responses in greater detail. One such approach is being used by Lawler and associates in the Pacific Northwest (http://www.climatevulnerability.org/). In recent decades, more and more field data have been collected that demonstrate actual species responses to changing temperatures and/or precipitation regimes (e.g., through changing distribution, timing of migration, reproduction, etc.), providing direct evidence of their vulnerability to climate change. We have highlighted a few such studies to indicate the breadth of direct evidence to be found in the published literature."}, {"section_title": "Coarse-filter Species Approaches --Indices", "text": "A number of coarse-filter approaches to assessing species climate change vulnerability have been developed and applied in the United States.

Ecoregions were used as the spatial unit of assessment as they are the most relevant environmental and ecologically distinct spatial unit at the global scale, and are used widely to guide global conservation investments, assessments and action. They mapped ecoregional exposure to future climate by using an envelope-based gauge of future climate stability, defined as the similarity between present and future climate (2050s We used a spatially explicit forest ecosystem model, LANDIS-II, to simulate the interaction of climate change and forest management in northeastern Minnesota, USA.

The SLOSH model estimates storm surge heights associated with hurricanes by simulating the effects of storm size, forward speed, track, wind speed and atmospheric pressure on water heights in the coastal zone. In addition to the development of storm surge hazard data based upon hurricanes alone, additional data layers were developed to represent the effects of sea-level rise on future storm surge inundation. Sea-level rise projections by 2100 from four of the illustrative SRES scenarios were used: A1Fi (+0. Authors examined marsh resiliency under these uncertainties using the Marsh Equilibrium Model, a mechanistic, elevation-based soil cohort model, using a rich data set of plant productivity and physical properties from sites across the estuarine salinity gradient. Four tidal marshes were chosen along this gradient: two islands and two with adjacent uplands. Varying century sea-level rise (52, 100, 165, 180 cm) and suspended sediment concentrations (100%, 50%, and 25% of current concentrations), they simulated marsh accretion across vegetated elevations for 100 years, applying the results to high spatial resolution digital elevation models to quantify potential changes in marsh distributions. The principal objective of this study was to develop a characterization of current shallowwater habitat components in Virginia tidal waters and predict climate driven changes to these habitats. To project broad-scale climate change effects on the abundance and distribution of coastal habitats, an inundation model based on anticipated relative sealevel rise, temperature and salinity projections, and coastal development were integrated into a GIS modeling framework. Using this framework, simple models were constructed that forecast the distribution of key coastal habitat parameters within the next 50 to 100 years including: shallow-water areas, tidal wetlands, submerged aquatic vegetation and estuarine beaches. http://ccrm.vims.edu/research/climate_change/COASTALHABITATS_FinalReport.pdf"}, {"section_title": "\uf0b7 Integrating Climate Change Vulnerability Assessments into Adaptation Planning: A Case Study for Species in Florida (Dubois et al. 2011)", "text": "Defenders of Wildlife assessed 21 species that reflected diverse ecological and management attributes of interest using the NatureServe CCVI, for potential use in the Florida State Wildlife Action Plan.

They conducted multispecies qualitative and quantitative analyses to find out whether the observed responses of freshwater fish to recent changes in climate are consistent with those predicted under future climate scenarios. They highlight the fact that, in recent years, freshwater fish distributions have already been affected by contemporary climate change in ways consistent with anticipated responses under future climate change scenarios: the range of most cold-water species could be reduced or shift to higher altitude or latitude, whereas that of cool-and warm-water species could expand or contract. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fwb.12081/abstract \uf0b7 Climate change is linked to long-term decline in a stream salamander (Lowe 2011) Author hypothesized that increasing air temperature and precipitation in northeastern North America caused abundance of the stream salamander Gyrinophilus porphyriticus in a New Hampshire population to decline between 1999 and 2010. He found a significant decline in abundance of G. porphyriticus adults over this 12-year period, and no trend in larval abundance. Adult abundance was negatively related to annual precipitation, which is predicted to increase further in the Northeast due to climate change. Analysis of a 6year capture-mark-recapture data set for the same population showed no temporal variation in larval and adult detectability, validating the abundance data, and no variation in larval and adult survival. However, survival during metamorphosis from the larval to adult stage declined dramatically. These results suggest that increasing precipitation is causing a decline in adult recruitment, which, if it persists, will lead to local extinction. http://dbs.umt.edu/research_labs/lowelab/images/stories/fruit/Lowe_2012_BioCon.pdf \uf0b7 Species of North American Turtles Over the Past 320 Ka (Rodder et al. 2013) In this study authors combine modern geographic range data, phylogeny, Pleistocene paleoclimatic models, and isotopic records of changes in global mean annual temperature, to produce a temporally continuous model of geographic changes in potential habitat for 59 species of North American turtles over the past 320 Ka (three full glacial-interglacial cycles).

Species that advanced arrival dates the earliest in response to warming were those that migrate more slowly, short distance migrants, and species with broader climatic niches. These three variables explained 63% of the interspecific variation in phenological response. Using a uniquely comprehensive 39-y flowering phenology dataset from the Colorado Rocky Mountains that contains more than 2 million flower counts, we reveal a diversity of species-level phenological shifts that bring into question the accuracy of previous estimates of long-term phenological change. For 60 species, we show that first, peak, and last flowering rarely shift uniformly and instead usually shift independently of one another, resulting in a diversity of phenological changes through time. Shifts in the timing of first flowering on average overestimate the magnitude of shifts in the timing of peak flowering, fail to predict shifts in the timing of last flowering, and underrepresent the number of species changing phenology in this plant community. Ultimately, this diversity of species-level phenological shifts contributes to altered coflowering patterns within the community, a redistribution of floral abundance across the season, and an expansion of the flowering season by more than I mo during the course of our study period. http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/03/12/1323073111.abstract"}, {"section_title": "\uf0b7 Global Warming and Flowering Times in Thoreau's Concord: A Community Perspective (Miller-Rushing and Primack 2008)", "text": "In order to determine how North American species' flowering times respond to climate, we analyzed a series of previously unstudied records of the dates of first flowering for over 500 plant taxa in Concord, Massachusetts, USA.

It is a contribution toward the development of a systematic approach to climate change adaptation in the Bank's water and environment sectors. One section of the report deals with vulnerability assessment. The report recommends that attempts to assess and respond to climate change should adopt a risk-based approach rather than focus on impact assessment: \"The considerable uncertainty about ecosystem impacts of climate change means that attention should be focused on using scenario analysis to identify those ecosystems that are most sensitive to and at risk from change rather than relying only on the development of deterministic predictions of impacts.

Continuation of these climatic and hydrological trends may seriously challenge the future of salmon, their critical habitats, and the tribal peoples who depend upon these resources for their traditional livelihood, subsistence, and ceremonial purposes. We assembled 18 temperature time-series from sites on regulated and unregulated streams in the northwest U.S. to describe historical trends from 1980-2009 and assess thermal consistency between these stream categories. Statistically significant temperature trends were detected across seven sites on unregulated streams during all seasons of the year, with a cooling trend apparent during the spring and warming trends during the summer, fall, and winter. The amount of warming more than compensated for spring cooling to cause a net temperature increase, and rates of warming were highest during the summer (raw trend = 0.17\u00b0C/decade; reconstructed trend = 0.22\u00b0C/decade). Air temperature was the dominant factor explaining long-term stream temperature trends (82-94% of trends) and inter-annual variability (48-86% of variability), except during the summer when discharge accounted for approximately half (52%) of the inter-annual variation in stream temperatures. Continuation of warming trends this century will increasingly stress important regional salmon and trout resources and hamper efforts to recover these species, so comprehensive vulnerability assessments are needed to provide strategic frameworks for prioritizing conservation efforts.

He found that vulnerability depends on the position of the wetland within hydrologic landscapes. Hydrologic landscapes are defined by the flow characteristics of ground water and surface water and by the interaction of atmospheric water, surface water, and ground water for any given locality or region. Six general hydrologic landscapes are defined; mountainous, plateau and high plain, broad basins of interior drainage, riverine, flat coastal, and hummocky glacial and dune. Assessment of these landscapes indicate that the vulnerability of all wetlands to climate change fall between two extremes: those dependent primarily on precipitation for their water supply are highly vulnerable, and those dependent primarily on discharge from regional ground water flow systems are the least vulnerable, because of the great buffering capacity of large ground water flow systems to climate change.  Mortsch et al. (2006) developed vulnerability indices to assess the current sensitivity of Great Lakes coastal wetland vegetation and wetland-dependent breeding birds to hydrologic changes, and fishes to hydrologic and thermal changes.

This comparison was performed for current conditions and for several possible future conditions reflecting alternative socio-economic scenarios and climatic projections. Examining alternative futures provides a measure of the extent to which serious future risks of water shortage must be anticipated. Water supply was quantified by first estimating freshwater input as precipitation minus evapotranspiration for each point in a grid covering the study area. These water inputs were then allocated to major river basins and made available to meet basic in-stream flow requirements, satisfy off-stream demands including those from downstream basins or those reached by trans-basin diversions, and add to reservoir storage. Off-stream demands were estimated as threshold quantities of desired water use based on extending past trends in water use under the assumption that water supply would be no more constraining to future water withdrawals than in the recent past. Modeling water supply and demand in this way does not provide a forecast of future shortage levels. Rather, it provides a projection of the degree to which water shortages would occur in the absence of adaptation measures to either increase supply or decrease demand. Citation: Foti et al.
