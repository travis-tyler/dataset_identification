[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Current hypothetical models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis emphasize the role of b-amyloid (Ab), tau deposition, and neurodegenerative changes in the mesial temporal lobe, particularly the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. However, many individuals with clinical AD who come to autopsy also exhibit cerebrovascular disease. The relationship between AD and vascular pathology is unclear, especially whether they represent additive and independent effects on neuronal injury. We used data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to (1) confirm whether entorhinal cortex and hippocampal volume are associated with memory among individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who are at risk for AD; and (2) determine whether regional white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, a radiological marker of small-vessel cerebrovascular disease, is associated with entorhinal cortex and hippocampal volume independent of putative AD biomarkers in this group. Methods: Cognitive test scores, entorhinal cortex volume, hippocampus volume, intracranial volume, and cerebrospinal fluid-derived phosphorylated tau and Ab1-42 protein levels were measured in 199 subjects with amnestic MCI (mean age 5 74.89 6 7.47). Lobar WMH volumes were derived from T1-, proton-density-, and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans. We examined the association between entorhinal cortex volume and cognition. Next, we examined the association of tau and Ab1-42 with entorhinal cortex volume and between lobar WMH and entorhinal cortex volume. Finally, tau, Ab1-42, and regional WMH volumes were entered simultaneously to predict entorhinal cortex volume. We repeated the analyses with hippocampal volume instead of entorhinal cortex volume. The analyses were also repeated with the sample restricted to those MCI patients who transitioned to AD on subsequent ADNI follow-up visits (n 5 86). Results: Larger entorhinal cortex volume was associated with better memory but not with performance on a task of executive functioning. Lower levels of Ab1-42 and higher temporal WMH volumes were associated with smaller entorhinal cortex volume. When entered simultaneously, temporal lobe WMH volume was more reliably associated with entorhinal cortex volume than was Ab1-42. The findings were similar for hippocampus volume and when the sample was restricted to MCI patients who subsequently transitioned to AD.\ny Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni. ucla.edu).

According to the model, b-amyloid (Ab) plaque formation precipitates a neurodegenerative cascade hallmarked by the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, which leads to neuronal injury, dysfunction, and degeneration. Among the most significant advances in AD research during the past several years has been the ability to operationally define these putative biological markers through neuroimaging and neurochemical analysis. For example, Ab can be measured in vivo in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or with amyloid positron emissions tomography (PET) techniques [2] [3] [4] . Likewise, the severity of neurofibrillary tangle formation can be inferred by measuring the amount of total or phosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein in the CSF [2, 3] . Early signs of neurodegeneration can be appreciated through analysis of metabolic changes on PET [5] , and frank neurodegenerative changes manifest as local atrophy in the mesial temporal lobe [1] . Temporal lobe atrophy, particularly in the entorhinal cortex (EC) and hippocampal formation, is thought to be the biological change most proximal to the onset of cognitive symptoms [1] .\nHippocampal and EC atrophy have been recorded in patients diagnosed with AD and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), although EC is believed to be the more sensitive biomarker [6, 7] . Pathological staging of AD [8] suggests that the EC is damaged before the hippocampus by neurofibrillary tangles and thus should be a more sensitive marker of earlier change, which is supported by in vivo studies [7] .\nIn addition to the roles of Ab, tau, and regional atrophy in AD, there is an emerging literature linking small-vessel cerebrovascular disease to the clinical presentation and course of AD [9, 10] , and many individuals with AD who come to autopsy evidence significant amounts of cerebrovascular disease [11] . Visualized as white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), increased small-vessel cerebrovascular disease, particularly when distributed in posterior regions, has been linked to increased future risk for AD [12, 13] and to course of disease progression [14] . However, it is unclear whether WMH should be incorporated as an additional biological marker for AD risk. One way of addressing this question is to determine whether WMH burden is associated with neurodegenerative markers of AD pathology, such as medial temporal lobe atrophy.\nHere, we examined whether Ab1-42, tau, and regional WMH are associated with EC and hippocampus atrophy [15] among individuals with amnestic MCI in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). MCI is considered an intermediate stage between normal cognitive aging and AD-related dementia [16, 17] , and in the ADNI cohort there was an effort to target individuals with the amnestic form of MCI thought to be at greatest risk for AD. Thus, an MCI cohort is enriched with individuals in the mildest stages of AD. The study of individuals with MCI affords the opportunities to examine some of the earliest changes associated with AD. Given the current hypothetical model of AD pathogenesis [1] , we hypothesized that Ab1-42 and tau would predict medial temporal lobe atrophy. Additionally, given the link of regional WMH to AD [13] , we predicted that WMH severity would be independently associated with medial temporal lobe atrophy, suggesting a role of small-vessel cerebrovascular disease."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Data from ADNI were downloaded (www.loni.ucla.edu/ ADNI), including demographic, biomarker, neuropsychological, and structural MRI data. The ADNI study was designed to mirror a clinical trial and thus only included participants who were in good health. It is important to note that only individuals without significant vascular risk factors, operationally defined as a modified Hachinski score [18] of less than or equal to 4, and good general health were included in the study. For the current analyses, we limited the sample to those meeting criteria for MCI and with available measures of CSF-derived biological markers. Diagnostic criteria for MCI included age between 55 and 90, a memory complaint (study subject or informant), objective evidence of abnormal memory, Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of 0.5, a Memory Box score of at least 0.5, Mini-Mental State Examination score between 24 and 30 (inclusive), general cognition preserved such that a diagnosis of AD could not be made, stable medication, and not depressed (Geriatric Depression Scale [19] score of less than 6). Recruitment and diagnostic procedures for ADNI have been reported previously [17] (www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI).\nThe ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), private pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations as a $60 million, 5-year publicprivate partnership. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials.\nThe principal investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center and University of California-San Francisco.

In brief, the T1-, T2-, and PD-weighted MRI scans were co-registered and skull-stripped [23, 24] . MRI bias fields were estimated during minimum deformation template warp estimation for the T1-weighted image and using an iterative statistical method for the PD-and T2-weighted images [25] . WMH were detected in minimum deformation template space at each voxel on the basis of corresponding PD, T1, and T2 intensities; the prior probability of WMH; and the conditional probability of WMH on the basis of the presence of WMH at neighboring voxels. The resulting map of WMH voxels across the brain is summarized by an estimate of total WMH volume. WMH volumes estimated with this method agreed strongly with WMH volumes estimated from fluid attenuated inverse recovery MRI in a large, diverse elderly sample [22] . WMH were calculated within a standardized space and an a priori defined lobar atlas was used to determine regional WMH volumes. Regional volumes were determined by summing the number of voxels labeled as WMH within each segmented lobe and multiplying those sums by the voxel dimensions.\nStructural MRI parcellation and segmentation data were downloaded from the ADNI website. ADNI structural MRI data were analyzed with FreeSurfer version 4.3 (https:// surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) at the University of CaliforniaSan Francisco after the T1-weighted MRI scans were converted to NiFTI format and preprocessed at the Mayo Clinic (http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/ UCSF-FreeSurfer-Overview-and-QC_-Template_Format.pdf).

The battery evaluated aspects of memory, attention, executive functioning, visuospatial abilities, and psychomotor speed. Given our interest in the EC and hippocampus, we focused our analysis on a sensitive test of verbal episodic memory, the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). In brief, the RAVLT includes five learning trials for 15 nonsemantically related words. Following an interference word list, subjects are asked to recall the words from the learning trials. Following a 30-minute delay, subjects are asked to free recall and recognize the words. We chose the delayed recall variable as a prototypical metric of memory retention. To determine whether the relationships were specific with memory functioning, we examined performance on the Trailmaking Test Part B, a prototypical measure of executive functioning. Our intention for these analyses were simply to establish that individual differences in the primary outcome variables of interest (i.e., EC and hippocampal volume) are indeed related to clinical measurements that are specific to AD (i.e., delayed declarative memory functioning) [27, 28] ."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "We first sought to confirm that EC and hippocampus volumes are associated with memory functioning among individuals with MCI in the ADNI cohort. We ran two separate multiple regression analyses with performance on the 30-minute delay of the RAVLT as the dependent variable and EC or hippocampus volume as independent variables and age, sex, education, and total intracranial volume as additional covariates. As a control, we examined the associations of EC or hippocampus volume with performance on the Trailmaking Test Part B. Using multiple regression analysis, we next examined the association of tau and Ab1-42 with EC volume (Model 1) and of lobar WMH with EC volume (Model 2) in separate regression models. Finally, tau, Ab1-42, and regional WMH volumes were simultaneously entered in a single model to predict EC volume (Model 3). We computed the R 2 change statistic to examine whether the inclusion of regional WMH volume data improved model fit over the analysis that included only traditional AD biomarkers (i.e., Model 3 vs. Model 1). We repeated the three analyses with hippocampus volume as the dependent variable. All analyses controlled for age, sex, and total cranial volume. Model 3 was finally rerun (Model 4) with the sample restricted to the MCI patients who progressed to clinical AD on subsequent ADNI follow-up visits (n 5 86).

Larger hippocampus volume was associated with better performance on the RAVLT delayed free recall trial (b standardized 5 0.327, P ,.001; overall model F (5, 194) Table 2 displays the results from the series of regression analyses. In Model 1 (CSF biomarkers only), higher Ab1-42 levels were associated with larger EC volumes, but p-tau was not (overall model F (5, 192) 5 6.99, P , .001). In Model 2 (regional WMH volumes only), higher temporal lobe WMH volumes were associated with smaller EC volume (overall models F (7, 193) 5 5.99, P , .001). In Model 3 (CSF biomarkers and regional WMH volumes combined), only temporal lobe WMH volume was associated with EC volume (overall model F (9, 192) 5 5.38, P , .001); none of the CSF biomarkers variables was associated with EC volume, although the relationship between Ab1-42 levels and EC volume was marginally significant (P 5 .058). Model 3 fit the data significantly better than Model 1 (R 2 change 5 0.052, P 5 .020). When we restricted Model 3 to only those MCI patients who progressed to AD during the subsequent ADNI follow-up visits (Model 4), the findings were identical; temporal lobe WMH volume was associated with EC volume, but the CSF biomarkers were not.\nHigher Ab1-42 levels, total cranial volume, and age were associated with larger hippocampus volume (Model 1; overall model F (5, 192) 5 14.272, P , .001). Regional WMH were not associated with hippocampal volume when considered alone (Model 2; overall model F (7, 193) 5 9.99, P , .001) or when considered together with the CSF biomarkers (Model 3; overall model F (9, 192) 5 8.61, P , .001); inclusion of regional WMH did not significantly improve model fit (R 2 change 5 0.021, P 5 .240). Thus, it appears that the association of regional WMH is specific to EC, although in Model 4, there was an association between temporal lobe WMH and hippocampal volume at a trend level (see Table 2 )."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "According to popular models of AD pathogenesis, atrophy in temporal lobe regions, particularly EC, is the most proximal marker of neurodegeneration in AD [1] . We showed that atrophy in the EC and hippocampus are specifically associated with poorer memory performance, the most salient early cognitive symptom of AD, among older adults with MCI. To understand what the predictors of EC and hippocampal neurodegenerative changes are, we examined biological markers of disease pathogenesis and regional distribution of small-vessel cerebrovascular disease, operationally defined as WMH volume. Our findings show that when included together, Ab1-42, but not p-tau, was associated with EC volume and hippocampal volume. We also showed that temporal lobe WMH was associated with smaller EC volume. When all factors were considered simultaneously, temporal lobe WMH was independently associated with EC volume, more so than Ab1-42 and p-tau. The findings remained unchanged when we restricted the sample to only those MCI patients who later progressed to clinical AD in subsequent follow-up visits. These findings highlight the important role of small-vessel cerebrovascular disease in the pathogenesis of AD.\nOur findings add to a consistently growing body of literature linking WMH burden to AD pathogenesis. WMH severity predicts future AD incidence [13] and course of cognitive decline among individuals with AD [14] . A facile critique of the extant literature is that samples under study had \"mixed\" dementia, with vascular factors and AD pathology playing a role because of insufficient medical screening of vascular factors. However, in ADNI, all participants are screened conservatively for vascular histories and current vascular disease, and participants included represent the \"cleanest\" medical profile without significant comorbidity, similar to those included in randomized treatment trials. Indeed, in ADNI, it appears that WMH severity is at least as relevant to medial temporal lobe atrophy as primary AD pathology.\nEvidence of the importance of cerebrovascular disease in AD pathogenesis and MCI also comes from well-designed clinical-pathological studies. Schneider and colleagues found that nearly half of individuals meeting clinical criteria for AD who came to autopsy had mixed pathology that included, in addition to classical AD features, either cerebrovascular disease or Lewy bodies [29] . They also showed that although AD pathology is the most common feature of individuals meeting clinical criteria for MCI, mixed pathologies are common and significantly increase the probability of MCI. Regarding MCI, the proportion of pure AD pathology was comparable among individuals with amnestic MCI versus individuals with nonamnestic MCI [29] , suggesting that current strategies to characterize MCI may not capture the underlying neuropathology with adequate specificity. In a more recent study [30] , algorithmic analysis of postmortem tissue revealed distinct subtypes of neuropathologically defined AD, including one that had hippocampal sparing, one that showed typical AD pathological features, and one that had predominantly limbic involvement. Frank vascular lesions were more prevalent among those with typical AD (28%) and limbic-predominant AD (36%) than those with hippocampal sparing (16%), again suggesting that the pathology underlying the clinical syndrome of AD can be quite heterogeneous with prominent cerebrovascular involvement. We treated individual differences in EC or hippocampus volume as proximal markers of AD pathology [1] , but the possibility that a small subset of individuals with AD have hippocampal sparing and that MCI as a diagnostic category itself can be quite heterogeneous suggest that medial temporal lobe volumetry in this population may lack diagnostic specificity.\nWe focused on the diagnostic category of MCI because it is enriched with individuals with incipient AD. It is important to point out that MCI as a diagnosis is a heterogeneous category and a proportion of individuals with MCI may never progress to AD. For that reason, we restricted our analyses to individuals who progressed to AD on subsequent clinical follow-up visits. The analyses revealed the same results: regional WMH volume was even more strongly associated with EC volume and CSF biomarkers of AD pathology were not.\nWe examined the regional distribution of WMH as opposed to a global index because of recent evidence from our group that WMH distributed in posterior brain regions are associated with increased risk of future development of AD [13] . In that study, we found that increased WMH volume specifically distributed in parietal regions predicted which nondemented individuals would progress to AD over time. Likewise, other studies have shown a greater posterior distribution of WMH among patients with MCI and AD relative to controls [12] . However, in the current study, our findings pointed to WMH in the temporal lobes as related to AD-associated neurodegenerative changes. The reason for a lack of consistency in ADNI with previous studies is unclear. We have postulated that posterior distribution of WMH in the context of AD may be mechanistically related to AD pathology itself via the shared association with vascular deposition of amyloid (i.e., cerebral amyloid angiopathy) [10] . Because participants in ADNI are very well screened for medical comorbidities, the restricted association of temporal lobe WMH with medial temporal lobe atrophy may reflect Wallerian-type changes secondary to neurodegeneration. Another possibility is that measurements of WMH in temporal lobe and volumetric measures of medial temporal lobe structures are not independent of each other, which may create significant relationships because of measurement bias. In any event, well-designed pathological correlation studies need to be performed to understand the underlying neurobiology of regionally distributed WMH and its relation to AD pathology.\nThe finding that higher CSF Ab1-42 levels were associated with larger EC and hippocampus volumes is somewhat consistent with previous findings. For example, Herukka and colleagues showed that Ab 1-42 levels were associated with hippocampal volume among patients with MCI that progress to dementia [31] . Desikan and colleagues showed a relationship between Ab1-42 levels and EC volume among nondemented individuals with elevated tau levels [32] . Similar results have also been observed in studies that have examined the association between amyloid binding on PET and hippocampal volume [33] . However, it is surprising to note that we did not find a statistically reliable association between CSF p-tau levels and EC volume. Although atrophic changes are thought to be most related to tau pathology [1] , findings have been somewhat inconsistent in the literature, with some groups showing an association between tau and brain atrophy [34] [35] [36] [37] and others showing no or modest associations in nondemented samples [38, 39] . Nonetheless, that welldefined medial temporal lobe atrophy was not associated with p-tau levels among MCI patients in ADNI raises some question about the sequence of biological events that ultimately lead to the dementia syndrome. We chose to examine total p-tau levels because CSF-derived p-tau appears to be specifically related to neurofibrillary pathology in AD [40] . The classification accuracy of the MCI diagnosis itself may also contribute to negative observations. Although individuals meeting criteria for MCI have been shown to be at high risk for future conversion to AD, diagnostic procedures for MCI such as the ones used in ADNI are not as valid as those that incorporate comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation with objective neuropsychological criteria [41] . However, as noted, our findings remained even when limiting MCI participants to those who met clinical criteria for AD at subsequent visits.\nFuture work should consider the longitudinal progression of white matter abnormalities in the context of longitudinal changes in more traditional AD biological markers. These initial cross-sectional observations are consistent with previous work and provide preliminary evidence that even in well screened, medically healthy older adults, WMH relate to pathogenic markers of AD. The question of whether regionally distributed WMH share pathological features with AD (e.g., through amyloid angiopathy) or whether they reflect other pathologies, providing an additional \"second hit\", needs to be followed-up with postmortem work.\nAngeles.
