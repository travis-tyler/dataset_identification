Methods: We studied a total of 148 dementia patients from the Feinstein Institute (Center-A: 25 bvFTD and 10 Alzheimer's disease), Technical University of Munich (Center-B: 44 bvFTD and 29 FTD language variants), and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (40 Alzheimer's disease subjects). To identify the covariance pattern of bvFTD (behavioral variant frontotemporal dementiarelated pattern [bFDRP]), we applied principal component analysis to combined 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scans from bvFTD and healthy subjects. The phenotypic specificity and clinical correlates of bFDRP expression were assessed in independent testing sets.\nThe bFDRP was identified in Center-A data (24.1% of subject ! voxel variance; P ,.001), reproduced in Center-B data (P , .001), and independently validated using combined testing data (receiver operating characteristics-area under the curve 5 0.97; P , .0001). The expression of bFDRP was specifically elevated in bvFTD patients (P , .001) and was significantly higher at more advanced disease stages (P 5 .035:duration; P , .01:severity).

This syndrome is characterized by progressive impairment of personal and social behavior, as well as emotional, language, and executive functions [1] . However, similar symptoms are also seen in various other psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), making accurate diagnosis of bvFTD challenging [1] , especially at early stages of the disease [2] .\nOverall, the accuracy of clinical diagnosis of dementia has been improved with the study of 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) brain scans [3] , as suggested by the diagnostic criteria for bvFTD [4] and AD [5] . However, the considerable individual variability in neuroanatomical involvement seen in bvFTD patients [6] [7] [8] restricts the use of regional and univariate analytical approaches for early and accurate detection of this disorder [2, 7, 9] , calling for the identification and standardization of multivariate quantitative imaging biomarkers [10, 11] for this dementia syndrome [12] .\nA multivariate brain mapping approach, based on principal component analysis (PCA), has been applied to FDG PET data for several neurodegenerative disorders to identify disease-related spatial covariance patterns [13] [14] [15] . The expression of such metabolic signatures [10, 13] can be quantified in the scan data of prospective individual subjects [14, 15] and thus has been used to aid in early differential diagnosis, predict disease progression, and track response to therapy [13] .\nNonetheless, to date, a metabolic covariance pattern has not been determined for bvFTD. The main objective of this study was to identify and characterize the bvFTD metabolic covariance pattern (bvFTD-related pattern [bFDRP] ) and assess its performance as an imaging marker for bvFTD. Our basic hypothesis was that bFDRP can classify independent bvFTD patients from healthy controls. Specifically, we identified bFDRP in a North American sample, cross-validated its reproducibility in a pathologyconfirmed European sample, and assessed its clinical correlates and classification performance for early-stage dementia."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Data were collected consecutively for dementia patients who had been referred for FDG PET scanning either to the Before the identification of bFDRP, a retrospective chart review was performed to determine the patient enrollment based on published clinical criteria for the corresponding disorders (i.e., bvFTD [4] , AD [5] , semantic dementia [SD] , and progressive nonfluent aphasia [PNFA] [16] ). Enrolled subjects for this study included a total of 35 patients scanned at Center-A (25 bvFTD and 10 AD), 73 patients scanned at Center-B (44 bvFTD, 17 SD, and 12 PNFA), and 40 AD subjects randomly retrieved from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu; see www.adni-info.org; previously studied at Center-A [17] ).

The use of healthy control group in the training set facilitates isolation and detection of the discriminant features of data structure. Refer to references [14, 15] for further methodological details. Cattell's scree plot was used to assess the contribution of each principal component (PC) to the total subject ! voxel variance (cf. Supplementary Fig. 1 ) [14, 23] . All subjects express each of these PCs by a corresponding score that is used to identify the PCs that contain significant diseaserelated information [14, 15] .

However, these measures, commonly used for AD, do not consistently correlate with disease progression and the associated deterioration of social and behavioral symptoms in bvFTD, thus often underrating its severity [29, 31, 32] . To overcome this limitation, we used symptom duration as the main metric to identify subjects at the early stage of dementia [29] ; and general cognitive measures were only used to exclude subjects with early presentation of marked cognitive or functional impairment [29] . This staging approach appears to be more valid than a sole reliance on general cognitive measures for comparing between bvFTD and AD [33, 34] . In this regard, the bFDRP classification power between early-stage bvFTD and AD subjects slightly decreased to 90.1%; that said, a high specificity (83.3%) was retained with a relative decline in sensitivity (83.8%). This apparent increase in misclassification may be due to the higher rate of clinical misdiagnosis between the two dementias at earlier stages of the disease."}, {"section_title": "Technical considerations and practical applications", "text": "To assess the generalizability of bFDRP, we treated data from the two sites independently both at identification and validation levels. By not mixing the data from the two sites, we also avoided introduction of site-related confounding variables, such as hardware and software discrepancies, in data covariance. The effect of such variables was further minimized by using the corresponding healthy controls from each site for the aforementioned analyses.\nA limitation of this retrospective study was that brain MRI scan was not broadly accessible for all subjects, thus the characterization of the bvFTD metabolic covariance pattern could not include volumetric measures. Of note, in neurodegenerative processes, the synaptic failure and concomitant reduction in local metabolic activity precedes neuronal death and the consequent volume loss. In fact, at early stages of neurodegeneration, localized metabolic reductions were reported in the absence of considerable atrophy [44, 45] .\nAnother limitation of this study was the lack of longitudinal data to explore the relationship between bFDRP expression values and disease progression. In the absence of such data, we had to rely on symptom duration, as a crosssectional measure of disease progression. Owing to the heterogeneous nature of bvFTD and the inherent variety in the patients' progression rates, this approach may have underestimated the true relationship between bFDRP expression and the underlying disease progression. Future longitudinal studies are required to appropriately investigate the potential of bFDRP as a disease-monitoring biomarker.\nIn addition, although a nonelevated bFDRP expression could exclude bvFTD with high likelihood, the determination of alternative diagnoses will require a multipattern approach that concurrently takes into account the covariance patterns of other diagnostic categories [46] . This approach will also allow the identification of indeterminate subjects, further increasing the specificity of differential diagnosis, which would be particularly useful in the settings of sample selection for clinical drug trials.\nFinally, the present study used a data-driven, voxel-based multivariate methodology [13, 14, 26] to identify the covariance pattern associated with bvFTD (i.e., bFDRP), which has not been determined before. This methodology is known to detect early neurodegenerative changes with greater accuracy than univariate or \"region-of-interest\" approaches [26] . Notably, the forward quantification of bFDRP expression in an individual patient scan does not rely on any a priori regional measurement; instead, it reflects the holistic interregional covariance of voxel deviation from reference mean values of FDG uptake [14] . Hence, the single-case measurements are minimally affected by the individual variability in regional involvement. This feature is specifically important in development of quantitative imaging biomarkers for a pathologically and neuroanatomically heterogeneous disorder like bvFTD [1, 6, 8] .\nK.

Systematic review: Based on our literature review using conventional search engines (e.g., PUBMED.COM), previous studies have collectively revealed the brain regional patterns of neurodegeneration in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) using univariate or region-of-interest methods of image analysis. However, the neuroanatomical heterogeneity of bvFTD calls for multivariate imaging biomarkers for clinical applications.\n2. Interpretation: A spatial covariance pattern of abnormal brain glucose metabolism, termed bFDRP (bvFTD-related pattern), can be used to quantify the early neurodegenerative changes related to bvFTD. As a quantitative imaging marker, bFDRP can facilitate the monitoring of disease progress in patients with bvFTD.\n3. Future directions: Further research should investigate a multipattern approach for differential diagnosis of dementia syndromes. Longitudinal FDG PET studies should validate the application of bFDRP for disease monitoring and prognostication. Future investigations may discover pathologyspecific metabolic topographies that can optimize sample selection in disease-modifying therapeutic trials of bvFTD."}]
