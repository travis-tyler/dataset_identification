[{"section_title": "", "text": "programmes. This study investigates the determinants of farmers' willingness to participate and the degree of participation in hypothetical PES programmes. Prior to the recent wave of research on PES programmes, many economic studies examined farmers' motivations to adopt conservation practices without incentive payments. Some of these adoption studies focused on single practices, such as conservation tillage (Rahm and Huffman, 1984;Epplin and Tice, 1986;Sheikh et al., 2003;Davey and Furtan, 2008), reduced fertiliser and pesticide use (Lasley et al., 1990;Bosch et al., 1995), and cover crops (Neill and Lee, 2001). Other studies focused on adopting combinations of multiple practices (Ervin and Ervin, 1982;Nowak, 1992;Wu and Babcock, 1998;Negatu and Parikh, 1999;Soule et al., 2000;Roberts et al., 2006;Wauters et al., 2010). Yet, other adoption studies examined the number of farm-level practices adopted Wei et al., 2009), land area allocated for certain practices (Gould et al., 1989) and expenditure on permanent conservation structures (Norris and Batie, 1987). This earlier literature provides a solid empirical foundation for PES studies by attributing farmers' adoption decisions to various natural, social and economic factors. However, apart from partial cost-sharing in several cases, these articles involve no incentive payment. Hence, decisions were chiefly based on the perceived net benefits of adopting conservation practices. Farmer participation in early paid conservation programmes was studied by Purvis et al. (1989), who examined farmers' willingness to accept payment in a hypothetical programme to adopt filter strips. They found that farmer decisions were determined by the size of the payment offer, perceptions of environmental change, and farmers' opportunity costs. For observed enrolment choices, Zbinden and Lee (2005) investigated participation in a PES programme in Costa Rica by farmers and forest owners. They found that farm size, household farm income, and familiarity with the programme significantly influenced participation. The 2001 United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Resource Management Survey reported that the farms most likely to participate in working land PES programmes were larger, operated by younger farmers, and more reliant on income from farming (Lambert et al., 2006). Some European studies of farmer participation in agri-environmental schemes have highlighted the importance of social capital (Damianos and Giannakopoulos, 2002;Mathijs, 2003;Defrancesco et al., 2008;Bertoni et al., 2011), location (Larse\u00b4n, 2006) and the eligibility of land and crops (Giovanopoulou et al., 2011). Although the decision on whether to adopt conservation farming practices with or without an incentive payment is well examined, previous studies tended to overlook an implicit prior decision about whether to seriously consider participating in the proposed programme. This willingness-to-consider decision addresses whether a proposed programme is sufficiently acceptable to merit closer evaluation of the financial assistance offered. Some farmers are very unlikely to consider providing ES through payment programmes, because those programmes do not pass certain prior screening criteria due to unfavourable physical settings or substantial perceived costs of adoption. These farmers' decisions are not likely to change with increased payments that are perceived to be in a politically feasible range. This payment range represents what farmers are likely to receive in real programmes and largely depends on their previous experience with government programmes. Other farmers may be willing to consider the programme, and would choose to participate given a suitable payment that is high enough to make the operation rewarding. Only a proportion of farmers who consider participating will elect to enrol, as the rest are unsatisfied with the programme payment offered. Explicitly modelling this additional choice on whether to consider a PES programme is likely to advance our understanding of farmers' participation decisions and provide insights on potential improvements in current PES programmes. Using the same stated preference survey data as Jolejole (2009), but with additional information permitting separation of the consideration and participation decisions, we analyse Michigan corn and soybean farmers' decisions in four hypothetical PES programmes, in order to examine the differences in decisions on whether to consider the programme and the degree of actual enrolment."}, {"section_title": "Conceptual Model", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Utility function", "text": "Following Dupraz et al. (2003), farmers are assumed to maximise utility that is based upon consumption of market goods (Z) and non-market environmental services (E), which are co-produced by farming activities. They face a budget constraint that the cost of consumption cannot exceed the sum of profit from farm production and non-farm income (NFI). Farm profit (p) is earned from selling agricultural products (Y) at price r y minus variable cost (r x X) and fixed cost (FC). Output Y is a function of inputs X and FC. The variable cost refers to material and hired labour associated with the level of production, while fixed cost in this study refers to predetermined resources, including family labour (L), capital (K), land area (A), biophysical conditions (B) and information (I) available to farmers. Environmental services (E), which are produced jointly with market goods (Y) using variable and fixed inputs, may also affect the magnitude and timing of variable input (X) employment (Zhang et al., 2007). F represents farmer characteristics that condition the production function and hence condition the effects of PES offers: The maximised utility given optimal choices of consumption level (Z*) and environmental services (E*) can be represented by the indirect utility function"}, {"section_title": "Willingness to accept", "text": "Enrolment in a PES programme could change farmers' maximised utility by requiring a higher level of environmental services or in return for a payment. Farmers' willingness to participate in a PES programme depends on the magnitude of the change in utility. This change can be measured monetarily by the willingness to accept (WTA) payment, which is the minimum payment that the farm household would require to provide specified environmental services under the programme. Assuming the supply of environmental services increases from E 0 to E 1 , WTA can be represented as the change in farm household expenditure (e) as a result of the change in the level of environmental services produced, holding utility constant at the initial level U 0 [Equation 6]: Based on Equation 5, the influence of the PES programme payment P on the change of farmer's utility can be represented by Equation 7. Under common assumptions that farmers prefer more payment to less but have a decreasing marginal rate of substitution between payment and other goods, the change of utility is an increasing and concave function of payment, Farmer WTA is a payment level that would leave utility unchanged equal to zero, as shown in Equation 8:"}, {"section_title": "Decision rule", "text": "The farmer decision to participate in PES programmes involves two steps. The first step, whether to even consider a PES programme assesses whether the programme might be potentially attractive if a sufficiently high payment were offered. Although the payment offer might be massive, in practice the 'sufficiently high payment' will be filtered by what farmers believe to be politically feasible. Thus, farmers would consider a PES programme only if the perceived maximum politically feasible payment P high is greater than their perceived WTA (i.e. P high > WTA). The second step, for farmers willing to consider the programme, is how much land to enrol. Farmers are assumed to enrol in a specific programme only if the programme payment offer P* is greater than their WTA (i.e. P* > WTA). Summarising the two steps, farmers' decision rule can be represented as follows: The levels of utility change in response to the adoption of paid conservation farming practices are unique to individual decision makers. Each farmer is likely to perceive a uniquely different change in utility for a given combination of proposed farming practices. Likewise, each farmer will have a different perception of the maximum feasible payment that determines whether they believe that conditions exist for a higher payment that they might be willing to accept. This study explores farmer' participation in PES by examining both the consideration and the enrolment decisions separately."}, {"section_title": "Data and Questionnaire Design", "text": "Data for this study come from a 2008 mail survey of Michigan corn and soybean farmers that yielded 1,688 responses (56% response rate) (Jolejole, 2009). The survey used a four contact version of the tailored design method (Dillman, 2007) consisting of: (i) a pre-notice letter, (ii) a questionnaire and one dollar incentive, (iii) a postcard reminder, and (iv) a replacement questionnaire. The survey design and questionnaire development were preceded by a series of farmer focus groups and pre-tests to ensure validity and clarity of the questions as well as an appropriate range of payment offers for those cropping practices. Six farmer focus groups were conducted during February and March of 2007, while in-person questionnaire pre-tests were conducted in January of 2008. A stratified random sample of 3,000 corn and soybean farmers was provided by the US National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) from the 2007 agricultural census mailing list. The farms were stratified into four groups by farmland area. Different sampling percentages of farms were drawn from the four strata with 0 to 100, 101 to 500, 501 to 1,000 and 1,000 or more acres, respectively. Larger farms were oversampled to capture how most land is managed, and also because of lower expected response rates among operators of large farms. Sample weights are incorporated in the empirical analysis to appropriately correct for the stratification. The survey questionnaire presented each respondent with four hypothetical cropping systems that provided a sequence of cropping practices linked to environmental service levels. System A, the base system, was a corn-soybean rotation with chisel tillage, pre-sidedress nitrate test (PSNT) in corn, all agrochemicals broadcast in the field according to either Michigan State University recommendations or pesticide label instructions. System B added a winter cover crop, system C added wheat to the crop rotation, and system D added a requirement to band fertiliser and pesticide application over the crop row and reduce rates by one-third below university recommendations or label rates (Table 1). Based on agro-ecological research, five major environmental improvements are expected from the four hypothetical programmes compared to a conventional corn-soybean system (Table 2). Soil erosion would be lessened by switching to chisel plough tillage from intensive tillage tools such as the moldboard plough (Reganold et al., 1987), planting cover crops over winter (Oades, 1984;Delgado et al., 1999;Joyce et al., 2002), and adding wheat into the corn-soybean rotation (Peel, 1998). Reduced erosion not only improves soil fertility and crop productivity (Pimentel and Kounang, 1998), but is also likely to mitigate the eutrophication problem of lakes by carrying less phosphorusrich topsoil into surface water (Correll, 1998;Poudel et al., 2001). Greenhouse gas emission in the form of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) can be reduced by adding cover crops (Lal et al., 2004;McSwiney et al., 2010), switching to chisel tillage (Reicosky and Lindstrom, 1993), adopting PSNT (Musser et al., 1995), and reducing fertiliser application (McSwiney and Robertson, 2005;Hoben et al., 2011). Farming practices related to nitrogen fertiliser application, such as cover crops, reducing fertiliser rate and PSNT, would also improve the groundwater quality due to less nitrogen leaching (Borin et al., 1997;Poudel et al., 2001). Reduced pesticide rates would also mitigate on-site and off-site air pollution and possible human health risks (Glotfelty et al., 1987;van den Berg et al., 1999). A main effect orthogonal design framework was constructed for the 16 questionnaire versions. The versions varied by payment levels offered (4), payment provider (federal government or non-governmental organisation) and sequence of cropping practices (increasing or decreasing in complexity and expected environmental benefits). For each cropping system, respondents were first offered a specific payment for adopting the given system for a period of 5 years, and they were asked how many acres they would enrol in such a programme. Respondents who chose not to enrol any land were asked whether they would consider enroling in that system if the payment were higher. Thus, the 'consider' group and 'not consider' group are distinguished based upon this question and assuming that all farmers who chose to enrol would also consider the programme with a higher payment. Within the 'consider' group, 'enrol' sub-group and 'consider but not enrol' sub-group are further identified by the first acreage enrolment question. Note that, unlike the conceptual model, the willingness-to-enrol question was presented ahead of the willingness-to-consider question. This approach mimics existing agri-environmental programmes that offer a real payment, avoiding an abstract question about hypothetical willingness to consider the programme without a payment offer. The subsequent question on considering enrolment with a higher payment follows naturally from a response declining to enrol. Figure 1 shows the number of farms falling into each response group in our dataset. Besides farmer choices associated with each cropping system, other survey information includes current crop management practices, farmers' perception of benefits from changed practices, attitudes on the importance of enhanced environmental services, past experience with beneficial farming practices, participation in our four hypothetical cropping systems containing those practices, and demographic background. Detailed information about data collection and questionnaire design can be found in Jolejole (2009). "}, {"section_title": "Choice of models", "text": "To model farmer participation in conservation programmes, several functional forms have been used in the literature. The basic participation or adoption decision is a dichotomous choice, so binary response models, such as probit (Rahm and Huffman, 1984;Bosch et al., 1995;Sidibe, 2005;Davey and Furtan, 2008) and logit (Lee and Stewart, 1983;Soule et al., 2000;Pautsch et al., 2001;Sheikh et al., 2003;Upadhyay et al., 2003) are widely applied. Ordered probit (Negatu and Parikh, 1999) and multinomial logit (Wu and Babcock, 1998;Zbinden and Lee, 2005) have been used to model choices among more than two alternatives. When the choice concerns the level of participation, typically the land acreage promised for certain practices, a continuous variable needs to be selected in addition to the binary participation choice, though the continuous variable is truncated at zero. In certain circumstances, a corner solution occurs when some acreage enrolment responses pile up at zero while others take strictly positive values. The simplest way to model a corner solution is the tobit model (Tobin, 1958), which assumes all zeros are generated due to the same mechanisms underlying the positive values. The tobit model has been used for adoption of farming practices in a few studies (Norris and Batie, 1987;Mazvimavi and Twomlow, 2009;Wei et al., 2009). One extension to the tobit model is a hurdle model (Cragg, 1971), in which different mechanisms are allowed for the decisions on whether and how much to participate. It has been used for examining the willingness-to-participate in agricultural conservation programmes (Uri, 1997) and other environmental programmes (Goodwin et al., 1993;Shrestha et al., 2007;del Saz-Salazar and Rausell-Koster, 2008). A further extension is the double hurdle model (Blundell and Meghir, 1987). In this case, two types of zero responses are implied, reflecting either non-participation or insufficient remuneration (payment level), where only the latter is likely to be determined by the same mechanisms as the positive enrolment response. Various types of double hurdle model have been adopted in studies of food consumption, such as meat (Burton et al., 1996;Su and Yen, 1996), cheese (Yen and Jones, 1997), alcohol (Yen and Jensen, 1996) and prepared meals (Jensen and Yen, 1996;Newman et al., 2003). A standard double hurdle specification seems to suit our dataset. Probit regression is used in the first stage to distinguish between potential participants and those who would not consider the programme. A tobit specification is applied in the second stage to investigate the decision on how much to enrol conditioned on willingnessto-consider. The complete econometric specification of the double hurdle model is shown in the next section."}, {"section_title": "Econometric model", "text": "Participation in an agricultural PES programme may involve two corner solutions before the real positive acreage enrolment can be observed. The farmland area that respondents choose to enrol in the programme is represented by y, which is a compound function of the binary consideration decision c, and the continuous choice of acreage enrolment, a, which can be zero or positive: Probit estimation is used for the binary choices of consideration. The latent variable c* indicates the farmer's utility gain per unit land area by considering enroling in the programme with a suitable payment: The land area (acreage) enrolment variable a is indicated by a latent variable a* and cornered at zero [Equation 12]. The independent variable vectors x 1 and x 2 , weighted by parameter vectors c and b influence the farmer's utility [Equation (10)]and area chosen for enrolment [Equation 13]. The random terms e and u are assumed to be independent with zero means and constant variances r 2 . The positive enroled acreage can be observed only if the farmer considers the programme and chooses to participate given a specific payment [Equation 14]: The unconditional density of y is derived by taking into account two decisions: The associated log-likelihood function used for Maximum Likelihood estimation is: Estimates of the two models are adjusted for stratum-specific sampling probability."}, {"section_title": "Variables", "text": "There is one probit regression for consideration and one tobit regression for acreage enrolment in the double hurdle model. The dependent variable for the consideration model is farmers' dichotomous choice of considering enrolment in the programme, which is contingent on the belief that the payment is politically feasible. The dependent variable for the acreage enrolment model is the number of acres that farmers would enrol in the programme, including both zero and positive acreages. See Table 3 for descriptive statistics on the dependent variables. The same set of independent variables is employed in both probit and tobit regressions for comparison. Six broad categories of explanatory variables linked to the conceptual model are defined as follows (Table 4): First, the design attributes category, corresponding to the attributes of the programmes that were part of our experimental design. These include the per-acre programme payment, P*, for each cropping system, the sequence in which the four cropping systems were presented to respondents, and whether the payment was provided by government. With the adoption of different cropping practices, farmers are assumed to incur additional direct costs (e.g. for labour and \u2044 or material inputs) and opportunity costs (e.g. for growing a less profitable crop). Following exploratory results from farmer focus group interviews in 2007, the payment offer ranges for the four cropping systems were: A: $4 to $17; B: $10 to $36; C: $15 to $55; and D: $20 to $75. The payment offer is hypothesised to have more effect on acreage enrolment than on the willing-to-consider decision, for which a larger but politically feasible payment is implied. The descending sequence dummy variable denotes respondents who received questionnaires with the sequence of cropping systems decreasing in stringency and associated payment offers. Second, the perception and attitudes category of variables corresponds to environmental services E. These variables depict farmer perceptions of ES benefits from certain cropping systems, and their attitudes on whether nature provides services that could benefit their crop production. These variables are measured on a 5-point Likert scale (1 for strongly disagree, 2 for disagree, 3 for neutral, 4 for agree, and 5 for strongly agree). The third category describes the biophysical attributes of farms corresponding to biophysical conditions B, which includes farm size and soil types. Larger farms are expected to be more likely to enrol in a PES programme because they have a higher capacity to invest and to withstand risks from changed practices (Knowler and Bradshaw, 2007;Prokopy et al., 2008). Soil type refers to dummy variables for soil texture. Clay soils may be more fertile but less well-drained than the loam soil baseline, whereas sandy soils are less fertile but better drained. Soil attributes exhibited mixed effects in different studies depending on the specific practices. In this study, enrolment in the reduced chemical system is expected to be positively related to clay soil, which tends to be more fertile than sandy soil and silty soil. Cropping systems with soil conservation practices, such as cover crops and corn-soybean-wheat rotation are expected to be positively related to sandy soil, which is more erodible. The fourth category measures farm management attributes. Different management practices would require different combinations of variable inputs X, labour L and   (Bosch et al., 1995;Wu and Babcock, 1998). The results depend on the payoff of irrigation associated with different practices. The fifth category of operator attributes includes age, level of formal education of farm operators, and whether farm income is the major source of household income. This category may influence farmers' information I and choice of management practice. Farmers who are younger and have higher education are expected to be more likely to participate. Farms deriving most of their income from agricultural production are hypothesised to be more willing to enrol in programmes requiring more intensive management. The last category includes market prices, which are represented by the output price vector r y in the conceptual model. Prices are represented by ratios of farmers' expected prices for wheat compared to corn and soybean. Both price ratio variables are expected to be positively related to adoption of cropping systems that require wheat, namely systems C and D."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Although the willingness-to-consider and acreage enrolment decisions are modelled using the same set of variables, results of the double hurdle model suggest that the first-round willingness-to-consider decision depends chiefly on non-price farm and farmer characteristics. By contrast, the second-round enrolment decision depends more on payment-driven benefit-cost criteria. Both consideration and enrolment decisions are influenced by two common factors. First, the perceived environmental performance of each system significantly contributes to both enrolment and willingness to consider each of the four cropping systems. This finding is consistent with previous studies (Gould et al., 1989;Purvis et al., 1989;Traore et al., 1998;Sidibe, 2005;D'Emden et al., 2008;Wei et al., 2009), as the perceived ES benefits both individual farmers and the society. A new finding from this study is that the marginal effects of perceived environmental performance increase from System A to D for the willingness-to-consider decision, but they decrease for the enrolment decision. This suggests that farmers would be more willing to consider systems with higher requirements and larger environmental benefits given the same unit increase in environmental performance, but would be less willing to enrol more land in those systems, perhaps due to higher costs associated with realising these benefits. The second common factor for two decisions is the sequence of presenting cropping systems to farmers. Farmers who were presented with the higher-complexity and higher-payment cropping system (System D) first were less likely to either consider or enrol in the other three cropping systems. This unexpected survey design effect may reflect farmers being less willing to make small improvements in their cropping systems or maintain low environmental performance practices if a larger return with substantial improvement is an option."}, {"section_title": "Willingness-to-consider decision", "text": "The double hurdle model complements previous PES studies by revealing several differences between the attributes that motivate the consideration decision and those that motivate the subsequent enrolment choice. These differences cannot be detected by a single hurdle model or a simple tobit model that lacks information on what farmers would respond to a higher payment offer. Three categories of variables drive the consideration decision (Table 5). First, farmers who believe their production can benefit from nature are 5% more likely to consider enroling in the programme. Previous studies also found that positive attitudes tended to promote enrolment in conservation programmes Sheikh et al., 2003), but this study explicitly identifies the significant impact of production-supporting ecosystem services on farmer decisions. Public extension and outreach programmes have great potential to improve farmers' general understanding of ecosystem benefits, which would further enhance participation when combined with perceived positive environmental performance from specific systems. Second, the similarity of current farm management practices to the proposed cropping system also increases willingness to consider the PES programme, reflecting lower perceived risks and less additional cost. Prior practice of conservation tillage, wheat planting, and reduced fertiliser input are illustrative examples. Farmers with an additional 10% of land under no-till are 3% more likely to consider adopting the programme that requires conservation tillage. Farmers with an additional 10% more of their land planted to wheat are 4% more likely to adopt the two cropping systems that include wheat in the crop rotation. Those who currently own Note: Significant at *10, ***1, **5% levels, respectively. Only significant variables are reported. See (Ma, 2011) for complete regression results. equipment to band apply fertiliser at a reduced rate are 10% more likely to consider System D, which requires this. Third, information variables such as education and past experience with a governmental PES programme generally promote willingness-to-consider. One more year of education increases the probability of considering the PES programme by about 3%. Prior research has also found positive effects of education on adoption of farming practices as education largely links to knowledge (Ervin and Ervin, 1982;Rahm and Huffman, 1984;Warriner and Moul, 1992;Bosch et al., 1995;Wu and Babcock, 1998). It was widely shown that farmers who are currently or were previously involved in conservation programmes are more likely to participate in a new programme (Ervin and Ervin, 1982;Bosch et al., 1995;Wu and Babcock, 1998;Defrancesco et al., 2008;Wei et al., 2009;Bertoni et al., 2011). We find that the influence of programme experience depends on the objective and restriction of those programmes. Past programme experience with the Environmental Quality Incentives Programme (EQIP), which is a flexible governmental PES-type programme, facilitates consideration of systems C and D by an additional 10%. However, experience with the Michigan Agriculture Environmental Assurance Programme (MAEAP) reduces the probability of considering enrolment by approximately 20%. This may be due to differences in programme goals between MAEAP and our hypothetical programme. MAEAP does not involve adoption of changed practices to benefit the environment; instead, it is designed to reduce farmers' legal and environmental risks by education, farm-specific risk assessment and on-site verification of 'generally accepted agricultural practices'. A previous study on early-adopting livestock producers found the primary motivation to participate in MAEAP was concern about existing or potential environmental regulations, rather than a predisposition toward environmental stewardship (Vollmer-Sanders et al., 2011). The Conservation Stewardship Programme (CSP) also has a slightly negative impact on considering two of our four systems, presumably because lands or conservation practices paid by other programmes are not eligible for CSP."}, {"section_title": "Acreage enrolment decision", "text": "While the consideration decision is driven by feasibility and awareness factors, the acreage enrolment decision modelled by the tobit regression is driven chiefly by benefit-cost criteria (Table 6). First and foremost, the per-acre payment offer has prominent effects on area enroled in all four cropping systems. As expected, the price-elasticity of land supplied declines with increasing system complexity. An increase in the annual payment of $1 \u2044 acre would raise the land area enroled in systems A, B, C and D by 18, 10, 7 and 4 acres, respectively. Compared to the other three systems, System A, which requires the smallest change from a conventional cropping system, has the greatest potential to be expanded simply by increasing the level of incentive payment. Second, larger farms enrol more land in the programme. A typical farm with 100 more acres in total cropland area would enrol 20-30 more acres, presumably because more land is available for production and any fixed costs of adoption can be spread over more output. This is a common finding in previous studies on conservation practice adoption (Lee and Stewart, 1983;Rahm and Huffman, 1984;Norris and Batie, 1987;Gould et al., 1989;Wu and Babcock, 1998;Damianos and Giannakopoulos, 2002;Zbinden and Lee, 2005;Lambert et al., 2006;Larse\u00b4n, 2006). Third, the percentage of moldboard-tilled land has a substantial negative effect on enrolment but no effect on the consideration decision in any system. One more percentage point of land under moldboard tillage would decrease land enrolment by 8.8 acres for System A and 7.6 acres for System B. This is presumably due to the fixed cost of converting from a moldboard plough to a chisel plough, which is required by all four proposed cropping systems. Fourth, farms with a higher proportion of irrigated land, more income from farming or older decision makers are also likely to enrol more acreage in some of the four systems. Irrigated land tends to use more fertiliser and would need soil tests to reasonably reduce the nitrogen application. Consistent with Bosch (1995), farms with a higher irrigation ratio are more likely to enrol in systems A and B, which include PSNT for avoiding unproductive fertiliser application but do not strictly cut fertiliser use. Similar to Lambert et al. (2006), this study suggests farms that rely chiefly on income from agricultural production devote more time and effort to farming and thus may enrol more land in the proposed programmes. In Table 6 Marginal effects from tobit estimation of farmers' acreage enrolment, weighted by stratum, by cropping systems, 1,688 Note: Significant at *10, **5, ***1% levels, respectively. Only significant variables are reported. See (Ma, 2011) for complete regression results. contrast, Defrancesco et al. (2008) found that high dependence on farm income constrained farms from participating in a northern Italian agri-environmental programme because of the potential risk of uncompensated yield reductions. Older farmers seem to be willing to enrol more acreage if willing to consider enrolment, though the consideration probit model indicates that they are less likely to consider enrolment in the programme. The age variable has shown both positive (Warriner and Moul, 1992;Okoye, 1998) and negative effects in previous studies (Gould et al., 1989;Neill and Lee, 2001;Damianos and Giannakopoulos, 2002;Lambert et al., 2006;Giovanopoulou et al., 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This study deepens our understanding of farmers' willingness-to-participate in payment-for-environmental-services programmes by separating the initial decision on whether even to consider the programme from the final decision on how many acres to enrol at a given payment level. Comparison of different econometric models for estimating and predicting PES enrolment leads to selection of a double hurdle model, comprised of a probit for willingness to consider and a tobit for acreage enrolment. The first-stage willingness-to-consider decision is motivated by farm and farmer characteristics that have non-marginal impacts on land enrolment, such as environmental attitudes, experience in conservation programmes, education, and ownership of large equipment. The second-stage land enrolment decision depends more on payment-driven benefit-cost factors that especially affect the net marginal benefit of enrolment, such as the per-acre payment offer, total cropland area, irrigated land proportion, use of moldboard tillage and whether most income comes from farming. The results also reveal the price elasticity effect of enrolment. As expected, the least complex system -a conventional conservation-till corn-soybean rotation -is most payment responsive. This system also has a large potential for state-wide adoption due to its suitability to small farms, which are numerous. The two stages are underpinned by two common factors: perceived environmental performance of the proposed systems and, importantly, the sequence in which the systems are presented to respondents. Understanding farmers' decision processes is an essential precondition for designing effective and efficient agricultural PES programmes. The two-stage model used here distinguishes the willingness-to-consider decision from the subsequent enrolment decision, providing fresh insights into how tiered policies can facilitate participation in PES programmes. For farmers willing to consider PES, the second-stage land enrolment model reveals factors deterring enrolment that can be overcome with higher payments. These factors include small land area, high proportion of irrigation land, low farm income, young decision maker and high proportion of intensive-tilled land. A small boost in compensation to farms with these traits could increase the total acreage enrolment from participants and some non-participants who will consider enroling in PES. On the other hand, the first-stage willingness-to-consider model identifies farms with substantial obstacles to participation that are not likely to be resolved by a higher payment. Three strategies could be employed to raise participation rates at successively higher cost. First, at relatively low screening cost, PES programmes can enhance participation by targeting more educated, experienced and properly equipped farmers who are favourably disposed toward environmental stewardship. Second, research and outreach that build farmer understanding of environmental services from agriculture and environmental improvements from specific conservation practices could also contribute to the appeal of agricultural PES programmes. As a common determinant for both the consideration and enrolment decision processes, farmers' perception of environmental performance from specific practices would also contribute to acreage enrolment. Third, substantial changes in programme design, such as subsidising certain farm equipment purchases and relaxing the eligibility of applicants and lands that are enroled in other programmes, could further engage farmers who are not likely to consider the programme. This last strategy can be useful to target enrolment by farms with high environmental impact in sensitive areas. In addition, high-stringency, high-performance programmes will be best received if offered directly to farmers without alternative low-complexity, low-performance options. While the farmers surveyed demanded higher payments for more complex practices, they were more open to complex options when those were not preceded by simpler ones. Our analysis of hypothetical PES programmes focuses on total environmental services generated, rather than additional ones. This approach has the advantage of treating equitably both prior providers of environmental services and new ones who join under the programme. However, from a cost-effectiveness perspective, tax authorities prefer not to pay for environmental services that would be provided for free. A reasonable solution would be a split-payment scheme that offers a higher rate for improved stewardship practice and a lower (but positive) rate for existing practices. Future research could measure the cost for different payment schemes between paying for all environmental services and paying only for additional environmental services generated by farms enroling in new practices. By combining such supply-side information with estimates of demand for environmental service improvements, it should be possible to assess the potential for a PES market in agriculturally generated environmental services. As a closing caveat, we note that the supply of environmental services from PES programmes depends not only on farmer enrolment (the focus of this article), but also on other factors post-enrolment. Recent articles have highlighted how strategic behaviour in compliance (Bartolini et al., 2012;Fraser, 2012) and environmental uncertainties can affect the actual delivery of improved environmental services from agriculture (Glenk and Colombo, 2011)."}]
