[{"section_title": "", "text": "As of 2013, public high school graduates earned an average of 26.7 credits overall, with 19.8 credits in academic courses, 2.6 in CTE courses, and 4.3 in enrichment courses. 1 The average overall credits earned by graduates in city, suburban, town, and rural locales were all within 0.3 credits of each other (figure 1). However, graduates from rural areas and towns earned fewer academic credits and more CTE credits than their city and suburban counterparts. 2 Graduates in rural areas and towns earned an average of 19.4 and 18.8 academic credits, respectively, compared to 20.2 and 20.0 academic credits among graduates in cities and suburbs, respectively. In CTE, rural and town graduates earned an average of 2.9 and 3.1 credits, respectively, while city and suburban graduates earned 2.3 and 2.4 credits, respectively. FIGURE 1. Average number of credits public high school graduates earned in each curricular area, by locale of grade 12 school: 2013 NOTE: Locale is collapsed from a 12-category urban-centric school locale code. Suburb and city are locales in urbanized areas with a population of 50,000 or more; rural and town are locales outside of urbanized areas. Public high school graduates are defined as students who graduated from a public high school with an honors or standard diploma by August 31, 2013. The figure includes only graduates who had a complete grade 9-12 transcript, defined as one that recorded at least 16 Carnegie units (the equivalent of one credit, or one course taken every school day, one period per day, for a full school year), with a positive, nonzero number of units completed in English.

Another CTE participation measure is concentrated CTE coursetaking. A graduate is a CTE concentrator if the graduate earns at least a minimum number of credits in one of the 10 designated CTE subject fields (figure 2), such as at least 2 credits or at least 3 credits in health care. Current federal legislation defines concentrators using a 2-credit cutoff. 3 Using that definition, a similar pattern was found: Relatively more graduates from rural areas and towns were 2-credit concentrators (43 and 45 percent, respectively), compared to graduates in suburbs and cities (34 and 35 percent, respectively). 4 Looking at credits earned within each of the 10 recognized CTE areas, two areas-agriculture and natural resources, and construction-follow the overall pattern, with graduates from rural areas and towns earning more To learn more about the data collection used in this report, visit https://www.nces.gov/surveys/hsls09.

Two other subjects showed variations across locales. First, graduates from towns earned more credits in engineering, design, and production than did graduates from cities and suburbs (0.43 versus 0.28 and 0.32 credits, respectively). Second, graduates from towns, rural areas, and cities earned more credits in health care than did graduates from suburban areas (0.21, 0.20, and 0.24 versus 0.11 credits, respectively). In contrast, there was no clear pattern in credits earned across locales in the six CTE areas of business, finance, and marketing; communication and communication technologies; computer and information sciences; consumer services; mechanical repair and operation; and public services. 5"}, {"section_title": "Endnotes", "text": "1 Not in figures; see https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/ctes/ tables/h185.asp.
