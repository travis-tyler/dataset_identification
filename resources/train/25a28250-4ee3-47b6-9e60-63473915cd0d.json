The brain age-delta (i.e, \uf044: the brain's estimated age minus the individual's chronological age) has been shown as a heritable metric for monitoring cognitively healthy aging, as well as for the early identification of individuals with high-risk of age-associated disorders or mortality (Cole et al. 2018) . For example, a brain age delta equal to zero indicates that the individual under study is following a healthy aging trajectory, whereas a higher delta-age would be indicative of an \"older-appearing\" brain and advanced cognitive aging. However, any accurate judgment about the individual under study forcefully relies on the prediction accuracy of the model. From a design perspective, most brain age frameworks use a training set of cognitively unimpaired subjects coupled with supervised learning to build this predictive model from brain imaging features as the dependent variable (Franke et al. 2010) . Then, for each new sample under study, the estimated brain age is computed by applying the respective brain imaging features to the predicting model. Lately, several brain age estimation studies have reported an age-dependent bias in these predicted results, which contributes to the uncertainty of the interpretation at the clinical level (Le et al. 2018; Cole et al. 2018) . Designing and developing a robust and highly accurate brain age prediction framework is therefore needed for any clinical application.\nIn this study, we propose an adjustment scheme for brain age estimation using fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) data, as per the technique described by (Goyal et al. 2019 )(sections 2.1 -2.3). The adjustment is based on a linear regression model of the brain age bias that includes chronological age as a covariate (section 2.4). We assessed the proposed bias-adjustment scheme on a large training set of metabolic brain features and compared the results of the proposed adjustment procedure with and without biasadjustment, as well as the method suggested by Cole (Cole et al. 2018 )(section 3.1). We will show that the proposed bias-adjustment scheme not only removes age-dependency in predicted results, but also can effectively improve the robustness of the brain age prediction results in an independent test set (section 3.2)."}, {"section_title": "Material and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "We selected adults between the ages of 47 and 94 years from various open and closed source databases to which we had access, namely the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), Alzheimer's Disease Repository Without Borders (ARWIBO), Banner Alzheimer's Institute (BAI), Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke (CHUS) and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS).

Otherwise, all FDG-PET image pre-processing was performed using the MINC 2.2.00 toolkit. Images were first converted to the MINC2 format, then co-registered to the first frame and timeframe averaged, with the exception of FDG-PET images downloaded from the ADNI database, which were already co-registered to the first frame of the raw image file and timeframe averaged, also known as \"post-processed #2\" (Jagust et al. 2015) . Images were then co-registered to their respective T1w MRI and partial volume corrected (PVC) using region-based voxel-wise correction, an extension of the geometric transfer matrix method. PVC was implemented using PETPVC, which is available on GitHub (https://github.com/UCL/PETPVC). Further details may be found at (Robert et al. 2011 ). Next, PET images were converted to standard uptake value ratios (SUVR) by the voxel-wise division of the average activity of the paracentral cortex, which had been reported as the optimal region for FDG-PET image normalization in normal aging studies (Jiang et al. 2018 ).

Both bias-adjustment methods showed the same effect sizes (AD/ "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The bias (i.e., age-dependency) is a substantial issue in brain-age frameworks. This bias may be caused by dilution bias (also known as attenuation) of the prediction model, which drives the prediction slope to zero rather than a true slope due to measurement error in the predictors (Young 2017 ). This bias therefore has an adverse effect on the outcomes for unseen data. The mathematical details of dilution bias is given in (Young 2017) . To diminish this age-dependency,\nCole and colleagues suggested an adjustment procedure as a part of the voxel-wise brain age framework on the basis of the slope and intercept of a linear regression model of estimated brain age versus chronological age (Cole et al. 2018 ). Cole's method was then successfully applied in a series of voxel-wise brain age estimation studies (Cole, Raffel, et al. 2019 ). However, when faced with a similar bias, we attempted to apply Cole's method to our PET-FDG data and noticed that it was increasing variance, as well as decreasing accuracy. Therefore, we aimed to design a new method that would not affect nor lower variance, all the while maintaining, if not improving, accuracy. The key idea behind our proposed method is to use the chronological age of each subject under study as a covariate coupled by the slope and intercept of a linear regression model of brain age delta against chronological age driven from the model training set.\nWe used a linear model as a function of real age (Eqn. 1) to compute the offset for each subject under study as we observed a linear relationship between the bias (i.e., Brain age delta) and chronological age in our training set ( Fig .1) . For other modalities that could have a nonlinear relationship with age, our bias-correction method can also be extended using a nonlinear basis functions. Indeed, our proposed bias adjustment only shifts the model slope to a true one rather than a false one due to dilution bias. We expected our proposed bias-adjustment scheme to yield more robust brain-age prediction results than other state-of-the-art bias-adjustment techniques (e.g. (Cole et al. 2018) ). The latter removed the age-dependency issue however both training and independent testing results demonstrated that it may not be a robust way to ameliorate the prediction accuracy, as it has a tendency to increase the final variance in the results. Conversely, our proposed bias-adjustment technique achieved a strong R 2 of 0.81 between chronological age and brain estimated age, an excellent MAE of 2.66 years on independent data, and a statistically reduced variance. In our simulated data, before bias correction, we observed a lower prediction accuracy ( R 2 = 0.38 ) with a higher age dependency bias on our training set compared to studies using T1-weighted MRI using different techniques (Le et al. 2018; Beheshti et al. 2019) . Thus, the nature of the data predicting age appears to induce more or less age dependency biases. Since FDG-PET data is inducing a prominent bias, the prediction is therefore markedly improved after correcting this bias. The association between brain age delta with clinical features, as a heritable neuroimaging-based metric, has been widely investigated in clinical research (Cole, Underwood, et al. 2017; Cole, Annus, et al. 2017) . For example, Cole and colleagues (Cole et al. 2015) explored the association between brain age delta and neuropsychological measures among traumatic brain injury subjects, and reported significant correlations between brain age delta values and memory as well as information processing speed. In another study, the correlation between brain age delta and body mass index as well as intelligence quotient was investigated among adults who suffer from Prader-Willi syndrome (Azor et al. 2019) . Of note, the exactness of these analyses relies on the prediction accuracy of the brain age models. While many factors might have a strong impact on prediction results (e.g.\nscanner properties, imaging modality, pre-processing, training size and population characteristics), the models might also suffer from an age-dependency issue due to regression dilution bias (Le et al. 2018) . This bias has been reported in a series of brain age estimation studies (Cole, Raffel, et al. 2019; Boyle et al. 2019; Cole et al. 2018) . For instance, Boyle and colleagues (Boyle et al. 2019 ) reported a significant age-dependency between delta age and chronological age among their training set on the basis of voxel-based features (r = -0.44, p < 0.001). Using Cole's method, they removed this age-dependency from the prediction results followed by a MAE of 7.28 years on training set (Boyle et al. 2019) . Consequently, a robust bias-adjustment technique for achieving bias-free brain age values was needed, which our proposed method seems to accomplish. In this line, statistical testing on brain age delta values among independent data showed that the proposed bias-adjustment scheme has the potential ability of distinguishing clinically different populations (i.e., MCI and AD patients) from cognitively unimpaired participants. It is documented that the brain age frameworks often require large training sets (Franke et al. 2010) . Likewise other bias correction methods, a large training set helps to archive more accurate bias adjustment's parameters. Moreover, characteristics such as sex may influence brain-age prediction, thus an unbalanced sample on sex might not be as generalizable as a balanced one. Regarding the difference among these independent test groups, the Le's method and our proposed bias adjustment technique showed a similar significant difference among these independent test groups (p < 0.001). However, the Le's technique is appropriate for group comparison only whereas our proposed method is also capable of producing bias free brain age values at the individual level. While our method markedly reduced the variance of the predicted age compared to Cole et al.'s method, both bias-adjustment methods showed the same effect sizes in AD and MCI clinical groups (AD vs cognitively healthy: d = 1.19; MCI vs cognitively healthy: d = 0.60). Hence, one aiming to compare brain age in MCI or AD and healthy controls can choose either method and should obtain similar results. However, our method is simpler to apply than Cole et al.'s, and more importantly in studies on other clinical groups or with other objectives than group comparison one could benefit from using our approach since it leads to more accurate age predictions.\nIn this study, we assessed the proposed bias-adjustment scheme on a brain age estimation framework followed by metabolic brain features acquired from PET imaging however, the proposed method can also be readily applied to other brain age frameworks such as voxel-based estimations (Franke et al. 2010) , EEG signal-based (Al Zoubi et al. 2018) , and patch-based techniques (Beheshti et al. 2019 ) (see supplementary materials for details).
