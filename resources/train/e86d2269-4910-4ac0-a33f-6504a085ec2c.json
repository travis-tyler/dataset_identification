This is the highest annual growth rate since 2002 and is nearly double the 1.7% growth rate seen in 2006. First-time, full-time enrollment of foreign students (the terms foreign student and temporary visa holder are equivalent in this report) eclipsed its previous high, set in 2001, and total enrollment of temporary visa holders topped its 2003 high. 2 Despite this growth, the proportion of S&E graduate students who are temporary visa holders remained below its peak level, set in 2002, because of growth in the numbers of U.S. citizens and permanent residents pursuing graduate-level study in S&E fields. Changes in enrollment from 2006 to 2007 are shown in table 1 under \"2006-07old\" for reasons explained below. The NSF-NIH Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering (GSS), which collects these data, was refined in 2007 to improve reporting. New fields were added to the survey, and some fields were reclassified.

Of the U.S. citizens and permanent residents, 67% were classified as white, non-Hispanic students.

Enrollments by temporary visa holders exceeded the previous high seen in 2003 and grew for both men and women and in all categories of enrollment.

Enrollment in S&E fields increased among U.S. citizens and permanent residents from all racial/ethnic groups in 2007. Notably, the number of Asians and Pacific Islanders enrolled in S&E graduate programs grew for the first time since 2003. For all other racial and ethnic minorities, increases in 2007 maintained the yearly growth in S&E enrollment seen since 2000. Even more than the trend toward gender parity, increasing racial and ethnic diversity has represented the largest change in the demographic composition of S&E graduate students in the United States: white, non-Hispanic students accounted for 71% of all U.S. citizens and permanent residents enrolled in 2000, as compared with 66% in 2007."}, {"section_title": "Postdoctoral Appointees", "text": "Current Year.

Science enrollment has grown every year between 2000 and 2007. Within science, the fields sociology, other social sciences, and the history and philosophy of science showed the greatest growth rates from 2006 to 2007. Psychology, biological sciences, and other social sciences exhibited the largest growth in absolute numbers. Enrollment in computer sciences grew by 2.7%, the first increase since 2002, and the biological, mathematical, and physical sciences each posted a 7th straight year of growth (2000-07). Although some science fields did show enrollment decreases in 2007, the declines were modest. In 2007 all engineering subfields grew, with civil engineering and other engineering increasing by more than 10%. Biomedical engineering continued to be one of the fastest-growing engineering fields and has more than doubled in size since 2000.

Science fields \"communication,\" \"family and consumer science/human science,\" and \"multidisciplinary/interdisciplinary\" studies are new to survey; these data may have been reported under other fields before 2007. Neuroscience is a separate science field in 2007new; most of these data were reported under health field \"neurology\" in 2007old and prior years. The remaining difference in overall S&E enrollment between 2007old and 2007new is due to survey respondents' review of the field assignments of their organizational units and resulting changes in reporting. The net impact of changes in units' field assignments (recoding) from S&E to health (and vice versa) is an additional enrollment of 1,411 students in S&E fields in 2007new. In tables 1 and 2, the column labeled \"Percent difference 2007old-new\" shows the net effects of the changes to the GSS instituted in 2007. With the exception of the four new science fields, differences between the old and new 2007 counts within fields are entirely accounted for by the recoding of units from one field to another by survey respondents. Fields with fewer graduate students in 2007new than 2007old had a net loss due to unit recoding; fields with a greater number had a net gain. Architecture, formerly included in civil engineering, was given its own engineering category in 2007. The vast majority of architecture graduate students reported in 2007 (3,796 of 4,601) were associated with civil engineering units in 2006, which explains the marked decrease (\u221219.1%) in civil engineering graduate students. The small field of sociology/anthropology had a net loss of 149 students (\u221217.9%) due to the recoding of three units."}, {"section_title": "Demographic Characteristics", "text": "The methodological changes also influenced the demographic composition of graduate students enrolled in S&E fields. As seen in table 1, the new methodology increased the number of women reported in S&E fields by 4.1%, as compared with a 1.7% increase in the number of men reported. In contrast to the total S&E graduate population, the majority of graduate students in the three newly eligible fields and neuroscience are women. Because these four fields represent a small subset of all S&E fields, the overall proportion of women changed only slightly; 44.0% of students reported in 2007new were women, as compared with 43.5% of students counted in 2007old. Communication, family and consumer science/human science, and multidisciplinary/interdisciplinary studies have a much higher percentage of part-time students than do S&E fields overall. The addition of these fields explains the greater impact of the methodology on parttime enrollments (3.8%) than on full-time enrollments (2.4%). Neuroscience has a dramatically lower parttime rate. Overall, the proportion of part-time graduate students increased marginally, from 27.8% to 28.0%, with the addition of these fields."}]
