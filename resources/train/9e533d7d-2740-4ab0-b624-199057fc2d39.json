[{"section_title": "| INTRODUC TI ON", "text": "Mutations in the viral genomes serve as the building blocks of viral evolution and remain the main reason for the novelty in evolution (Baer, 2008; Duffy, 2018) . However, mutations in the viral genomes are not restricted to their replication since they can also result from spontaneous nucleic acid damage over time in different host populations or from editing of the genetic materials. Thus, a large portion of mutations, either at nucleotides (nt) and/or change in amino acids (aa) levels, are harmful (Loewe & Hill, 2010) . RNA viruses like SARS-CoV-2 generally have higher mutation rates; however, a few of these mutations are correlated with differential virulence, evolving ability, and traits considered beneficial for viruses (Duffy, 2018; Islam et al., 2020) . Inherent high mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 has already produced many descendants from the original Wuhan strain, which complicates its genotyping. The ability of the structural proteins especially spike protein, in different strains of the SARS-CoV-2 to undergo rapid changes have enabled their genomes to emerge in novel hosts, escape vaccine-induced immunity and evolve in diverse geo-climatic conditions (Duffy, 2018; Islam et al., 2020; Loewe & Hill, 2010) . Moreover, spontaneous mutation is a key parameter in modelling the genetic structure and evolution of populations (Drake & Holland, 1999) . Therefore, investigation of the increased rate of non-synonymous mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes could be an important tool in assessing the genetic health of the populations. SARS-CoV-2 comprises of four major structural proteins-specifically spike (S) glycoproteins, envelope (E) proteins, membrane (M) proteins and nucleocapsid (N) proteins (Ahmed et al., 2020; Rahman et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020) . The entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells is mediated by the transmembrane S protein which consists of two functional subunits responsible for binding to the host cell receptor (S1 subunit), and for fusing the viral and cellular membranes (S2 subunit) (Walls et al., 2020) . The higher antigenic and surface exposure properties of the S protein facilitate the attachment and entry of viral particles into the host cells through the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (Grant et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2019) . Therefore, the spike contains highest variations and determines, to some extent, the viral host range (Coutard et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020) . Furthermore, the S protein is the main target of neutralizing antibodies (Abs) upon infection and is thus one of the most important structures for therapeutics and vaccine design Walls et al., 2020) .\nThe continuing rapid transmission and global spread of have raised intriguing questions regarding the evolution and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 in diverse geographic and climatic conditions driven by non-synonymous mutations, deletions and/or replacements (Bal et al., 2020; Islam et al., 2020; Pachetti et al., 2020) . The capability of the different strains of SARS-CoV-2 strains for swiftly adapting to diverse environments could be linked with their geographic distributions.\nThough not yet well studied, evidence suggests that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infections and per day mortality rate from this infection is positively associated with weather conditions, and the diurnal temperature range (DTR) (Su et al., 2016; Islam et al., 2020) . However, the exact role of geo-climatic conditions on SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, but it would be worth keeping in mind that this novel disease originated from wildlife before spreading to humans (Harvey, 2020) . Therefore, genomic mutation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 strains, integrated with geographic and climatic data, would provide a fuller understanding of the origin, dispersal and dynamics of the evolving SARS-CoV-2 virus.\nAlthough several reports predicted possible adaptations at the nucleotide and aa level, along with structural heterogeneity in viral proteins, especially in the S protein (Armijos-Jaramillo et al., 2020; Islam et al., 2020; Phan, 2020; Sardar et al., 2020) , most of these studies were carried out few complete representative genomes from a limited geographic area. As the genome number is increasing day by day, regular in-house monitoring of the crucial components such as the S protein is urgently necessary to understand the genomic basis and evolution of the diagnostic RT-PCR primer. There are a few pipelines (Yin, 2020) and websites (https://mendel.bii.astar.edu.sg/METHO DS/ coron a/beta/MUTAT IONS/hCoV19_Human_2019_Wuhan WIV04/ hCoV-19_Spike_new_mutat ions_table.html) in GSAID where aa change or substitution can be observed. In order to provide an alternative tool with a wider range of functions, we present an easy rapid pipeline that will assist in the alignment of large volumes of viral genomes, remove low-quality sequences and in-frame stop codons and provide in-house non-synonymous mutation analysis of large volumes of sequences while requiring minimal knowledge of the command line. This tool can perform this analysis for any other proteins as required. This study aimed to investigate the mutational spectra of aa utilizing this novel methodology in the S proteins in 35,750 complete genome sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 belonging to 135 countries and/regions, and five climatic zones around the world, retrieved from the global initiative on sharing all influenza data (GISAID) (https://www.gisaid.org/) up to 24\nJune 2020 (Data S1)."}, {"section_title": "| Genomic data collection and processing", "text": "To decipher the genetic variations of the S glycoprotein, we retrieved 53,981 complete (or near-complete) genome sequences of variation of many other divergent RNA viruses in the future.
