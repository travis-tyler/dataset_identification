The goal of the current study was to evaluate multiple whole-brain and region-specific approaches to detect clinically relevant tau PET signal. Two independent cohorts of cognitively normal adults and amyloid-positive (A\u03b2 + ) patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD-dementia underwent [\n18 F]AV-1451 PET. Methods for tau tracer quantification included: (i) in vivo Braak staging, (ii) regional uptake in Braak composite regions, (iii) several whole-brain measures of tracer uptake, (iv) regional uptake in AD-vulnerable voxels, and (v) uptake in a priori defined regions. Receiver operating curves characterized accuracy in distinguishing A\u03b2 -controls from AD/MCI patients and yielded tau positivity cutoffs.\nClinical relevance of tau PET measures was assessed by regressions against cognition and MR imaging measures. Key tracer uptake patterns were identified by a factor analysis and voxel-wise contrasts. Braak staging, global and region-specific tau measures yielded similar diagnostic accuracies, which differed between cohorts. While all tau measures were related to amyloid and global cognition, memory and hippocampal/ entorhinal volume/thickness were associated with regional tracer retention in the medial temporal lobe. Key regions of tau accumulation included medial temporal and inferior/middle temporal regions, retrosplenial cortex, and banks of the superior temporal sulcus. Our data indicate that whole-brain tau PET measures might be adequate biomarkers to detect AD-related tau pathology. However, regional measures covering ADvulnerable regions may increase sensitivity to early tau PET signal, atrophy and memory decline."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein into intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) is one of the key pathological lesions in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but early tau pathology in medial temporal lobe regions is also common in cognitively normal elderly people (Crary et al., 2014) . Post-mortem data indicate that tau accumulation begins in mid-life, years before amyloid beta (A\u03b2) plaques deposit in the neocortex Braak, 1991, 1997) . The recent advent of tauspecific positron emission tomography (PET) tracers now allows assessment of regional tau load in the living human brain (Dani et al., 2016; Saint-Aubert et al., 2017; Villemagne et al., 2015) , which will provide new insights into the etiology of AD, and help diagnostic accuracy, early detection, and development of treatment. The tauspecific radioligand that has been most widely studied so far is 18 [F] filament tau in AD patients (Chien et al., 2013; Lowe et al., 2016; Marqui\u00e9 et al., 2015) . Several studies have recently shown that the topography of tau tracer retention corresponds well with expected pathologic stages of NFT deposition delineated by Braak and Braak (Cho et al., 2016a; Johnson et al., 2016; Sch\u00f6ll et al., 2016; Schwarz et al., 2016) . Across studies, most normal elderly adults demonstrate elevated binding confined to the medial temporal lobe, whereas neocortical binding, particularly in the inferior temporal lobe, is associated with clinical impairment and the presence of A\u03b2. Furthermore, recent tau PET studies have found a close relationship between patterns of tau deposition and hypometabolism Saint-Aubert et al., 2016) , atrophy Wang et al., 2016) and cognitive impairment (Brier et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2016; Ossenkoppele et al., 2016) , in contrast to weaker associations seen with A\u03b2. A\u03b2 PET imaging has been employed for over a decade, and it is now commonly used in therapeutic trials and as a biomarker for clinical diagnosis (McKhann et al., 2011; Siemers et al., 2016) . In contrast, the novel modality of tau PET has only recently been incorporated into a proposed new biomarker classification system (Jack et al., 2016a) . In this new A/T/N system, A\u03b2 (PET or CSF A\u03b2 42), tau (PET or CSF phospho-tau), and neurodegeneration (fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, structural MRI, or CSF total tau) are each rated as positive or negative to categorize individuals. While cutoffs for A\u03b2 PET positivity have been intensively studied and compared across different A\u03b2 PET imaging agents (Landau et al., 2013; Mormino et al., 2012; Villeneuve et al., 2014) , there is no consensus yet on how to label tau PET scans as normal or abnormal. Unlike the diffuse distribution of A\u03b2, which is commonly quantified as global cortical mean tracer uptake, tau accumulation shows a hierarchical pattern of spread (Cho et al., 2016a) . Thus, the question of how to define tau accumulation requires examination of both the quantity of tracer retention and its location, each of which can be defined in multiple ways. One approach that has been recently used to categorize tau PET positivity is based on the mean tracer uptake in a pre-specified set of \"AD-signature\" regions (Jack et al., 2016b; Wang et al., 2016) . Authors defined cut points by the accuracy to distinguish between clinically impaired and cognitively normal adults. An alternative to a binary classification, previously examined in our lab , is a multi-stage approach as proposed by Braak and Braak that is based on the topographic pattern of NFT pathology.\nThe goal of the current study was to evaluate and compare different approaches to detect clinically relevant tau PET signal and to stage participants. Two independent cohorts of A\u03b2 + and A\u03b2 -cognitively healthy adults as well as A\u03b2 + patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD-dementia received [ 18 F]AV-1451 tau PET. We employed topographic staging of tau based on Braak-region specific tracer uptake. We also assessed different whole-brain measures to define tracer retention including a global average, a voxel-wise t-score relative to young/middle-aged participants, and the number of supra-threshold voxels. Finally, we quantified tau from AD-vulnerable composite regions: one defined by our group of MCI and AD patients and a second reported in the literature (Jack et al., 2016b ). Because we do not have independent neuropathological data to confirm the validity of each method, we examined reliability across cohorts, and correlations with clinical and other variables to assess face validity. For each approach we derived imaging biomarker cut points of tau positivity by discriminating A\u03b2 -cognitively normal elderly participants from A\u03b2 + MCI and AD patients in one cohort, and tested their reliability (i.e. accuracy) in the other cohort. Finally, we compared the regional pattern of tau PET signal across the different approaches."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "We studied two independent samples, both of which included A\u03b2 + and A\u03b2 -cognitively normal adults, as well as A\u03b2 + patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or probable AD dementia (Table 1) .

A detailed description of this approach can be found in Sch\u00f6ll et al. (2016) .\nIn brief, we employed a conditional inference tree in R (v. 3.1.2; Ihaka and Gentleman, 1996) using the function \"ctree\" of the package \"party\" to classify subjects with regard to their clinical diagnosis (i.e. YC, OC, AD). We started at late Braak regions, entering the whole dataset into the model to derive an SUVR threshold above which subjects were classified as stage V/VI. After removal of those subjects, we continued the staging with the next Braak ROI (III/IV). Continuing this approach we derived 3 thresholds to assign subjects to stage V/VI, stage III/IV, and stage I/II, defining subjects reaching no threshold as stage 0.\nIn the current study, we first aimed to re-calculate Braak ROI-based thresholds due to changes in data pre-processing. Therefore, we used the original sample of 5 young (age range 20-26 yrs) and 33 elderly controls from BACS and 15 AD subjects from UCSF. Changes to preprocessing included an initial smoothing to match ADNI AV-1451 resolution, the addition of non-cerebral tissues to the PVC, as well as final re-normalization of each region post-PVC by inferior cerebellar gray.

First, to derive a global mean SUVR, we calculated a size-weighted average across all ROIs that were included in the Braak regions after PVC (note that this does not include basal ganglia and thalamus).\nSecond, we used the MNI space SUVR images (no PVC, cortical mask excluding basal ganglia and thalamus) to calculate a global sum tvalue score across \"abnormal\" voxels. The explicit mask can be downloaded from Supplementary file 1. The t-value for each voxel in each scan was calculated relative to the mean and standard error of the mean of BACS YC/MAC subjects (for each voxel: t subject =[SUVR subjectmean(SUVR YC/MAC )]/SE(SUVR YC/MAC ). For every participant, we calculated the sum of t-values across all voxels where t > 4 (corresponding to 1-sided alpha of .001, 11 degrees of freedom). The utility of a tsum score as a diagnostic indicator of PET scan abnormality has been reported previously (Chen et al., 2011; Herholz et al., 2002) when using FDG-PET to calculate a summary measure of hypometabolism. A square-root transformation of the t-sum was performed as proposed by Herholz et al. (2002) .\nFinally, as a whole-brain measure of tau spread, we counted the number of voxels above a certain SUVR threshold for each subject in MNI space data (no PVC, cortical mask excluding basal ganglia and thalamus; see Supplementary file 1). First we examined the relationship between SUVR threshold and number of supra-threshold voxels in each group. We determined the SUVR threshold (in an SUVR range from 1 to 3, with .1 step-size) that yielded the best discrimination between A\u03b2 -OC and MCI/AD patients by means of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) area under the curve (AUC). A threshold of 1.4\nyielded the highest AUC compared to other cutoffs (see results); we therefore used percentage of voxels above an SUVR of 1.4 as a measure for subsequent analyses.\nThe global mean SUVRs derived from a weighted average across all Braak regions (excluding basal ganglia and thalamus) after PVC are displayed as individual data and group-specific mean values in Fig. 2A ).

A threshold of 1.4 yielded the highest AUC compared to other cutoffs (see Methods and Fig. 2B ). Individual subject data and average values by diagnostic groups are shown in Fig. 2C .

The resulting factor score serves as summary uptake measures unbiased by assumptions of ROI or reference regions. A similar approach has been used recently by Brier et al. (2016) , who applied singular value decomposition on AV-1451 data to identify unique disease-related stereotypical spatial patterns.\nThe particular type of factor analysis we used is called Nonparametric Sparse Factor Analysis (NSFA; Knowles and Ghahramani, 2011) , which optimizes for sparsity (and hence, interpretability) of latent topographical factors, while allowing the number of factors to grow as needed. We fit the model to 89 baseline AV-1451 PET scans in the ADNI database (31 OC, 11 SMC, 19 EMCI, 19 LMCI, and 9 AD subjects). Of note, the factor analysis was run prior to the current analyses on an earlier data set of ADNI AV-1451 scans also including A\u03b2 -MCI and AD patients to increase variability.\nTo convert AV-1451 scans into an input format amenable for factor analysis, we represented each scan as a vector consisting of the PVcorrected means of 40 bilateral FreeSurfer-defined brain regions. These include the 36 bilateral Braak ROIs as well as cerebral white matter, cerebellar gray matter, cerebellar white matter and brainstem (note that choroid plexus and non-cerebral tissues were not included here). Each scan vector was normalized by its l 1 -norm (\"Manhattan norm\"), and then each region value was standardized to a Z-score across all subjects.

The initial step involved recalculation of the previously published Braak stage classification using the original data set (5 young and 33 old controls, 15 AD patients) reprocessed as described above. To derive thresholds for each Braak composite ROI, we used a non-parametric class of regression trees to classify subjects in stages (I/II, III/IV, V/VI) with regard to clinical diagnosis, based on each subject's mean SUVR in that ROI. Proceeding from high (V/VI) to low Braak (I/II) regions, we derived cutoff SUVR values above which subjects were classified at the specific stage (all p-values < .001). Results are summarized in Table 2 . Similar to our previous results , the classification approach assigned 14/15 AD patients to stage V/VI (Braak V/VI mean SUVR > 1.873), the 1 remaining AD subject and 6/33 elderly controls to stage III/IV (Braak III/IV mean SUVR > 1.304), and 23/33 elderly controls and 2/5 young subjects to stage I/II (Braak I/II mean SUVR > 1.129). The remaining 4/33 old and 3/5 young controls were classified as stage 0. Similarly, thresholds for non PV-corrected data were derived and are as follows: 1.407, 1.232 and 1.135 for Braak V/VI, Braak III/IV and Braak I/II mean SUVR, respectively. When using non-PV corrected data, stages differed by \u00b1 1 for 22/146 BACS/UCSF and 10/ 70 ADNI subjects.\nValidation of Braak stage ROI thresholds on independent data sets. Next we applied the new thresholds (PV-corrected) to the remaining newly acquired BACS controls (7 YC/MAC, 41 OC) as well as 12 MCI and 33 AD patients from UCSF (Table 2) . Most AD subjects (n = 29/33) were assigned to stage V/VI, whereas the majority of MCI patients were classified as stage III/IV (n = 5/12), with 4 in stage V/VI and 3 in stage I/II. Only 7/41 elderly controls were assigned to stage III/IV. The majority of old controls (n = 34/41) and all YC/MAC participants were assigned to stage I/II or 0. Braak ROI specific tracer uptake for each group across the whole BACS/UCSF sample is displayed in Fig. 1A (left panel) . Thresholds are illustrated as solid lines. Braak ROI uptake for early-versus late-onset ADs is further illustrated in Supplementary Fig. S1 . Early-onset AD patients (age < 65 years) showed stronger uptake in Braak V/VI regions compared to late-onset patients (p = .002).\nIn a next step we used the Braak ROI thresholds to categorize ADNI subjects (Table 2 and Fig. 1A ; right panel). ADNI AD patients had overall lower Braak V/VI ROI uptake than UCSF patients. Only 1/9 AD and 1/19 MCI patients exceeded the threshold for stage V/VI. Most MCI (n = 10/19) and AD patients (n = 5/9) were assigned to stage III/ IV, the remaining patients to stage I/II (5/19 MCIs, 3/9 ADs) or stage 0 (3/19 MCIs). From all 43 ADNI elderly controls, 8 were classified as III/IV, whereas the majority (n = 25/43) were categorized as stage I/II. The remaining 9/43 OC were classified as stage 0.\nAcross both samples, 70% of A\u03b2 -OC were categorized as stage I/II and only 6% as stage III/IV, while in A\u03b2 + OC the proportion for stage III/IV was much higher with 36%. No elderly normal subject exceeded the threshold for stage V/VI. Regarding MCI subjects, 48% fell into the III/IV category and 16% exceeded the threshold for stage V/VI. Out of all AD patients, 77% were assigned to stage V/VI, 16% to stage III/IV and only 7% stage I/II. The percentage of subjects assigned to specific stage is illustrated for each group in Supplementary Fig. S2 .\nVoxel-wise comparisons between Braak ROI stages. In a next step we wanted to verify the regions accounting for the difference in Braak ROIspecific AV-1451 uptake and thus assignment to different stages. We performed voxel-wise 2-sample t-tests between participants assigned to contiguous stages (using the MNI-warped SUVR images, no PVC), merging both samples to increase sample size. Results are illustrated in Fig. 1B . Stage I/II participants (n = 89) showed significantly more tau tracer uptake in hippocampus and adjacent parahippocampal regions (mostly anterior) than stage 0 participants (n = 33). Voxel-wise t-tests between stage III/IV (n = 45) and I/II subjects revealed elevated uptake in medial temporal lobe, inferior temporal cortex, retrosplenial/ posterior cingulate cortex, parietal and frontal regions. Stage III/IV is of particular interest since it might be considered as the transitional stage towards AD. We additionally examined tracer uptake patterns separately patients (MCI/AD, n = 24) and controls (n = 21) in stage III/IV (see Supplementary Fig. S3 ). Regions showing elevated tracer retention (relative to stage I/II controls) in cognitively normal subjects staged III/IV were remarkably similar to those seen in AD/MCI patients, but with weaker tracer uptake. In both t-tests, strongest difference was seen in amygdala/entorhinal cortex at the border towards the hippocampal head.

Since many ROIs were highly correlated with each other, they might be more concisely summarized as topographies. We only report the factor that explained most variance (81%) and that might be interpreted as global tau. Factor weights for all individual Braak stage ROIs are displayed in Table 4 sorted from low to high Braak stage. In addition, positive factor weights are illustrated as a heat map in Fig. 5 . Regions with strongest positive factor weights comprised inferior parietal, middle and inferior temporal, and middle frontal cortex. Basal ganglia, and thalamus, regions that typically show off-target binding, had highest negative factor weights (not shown). Furthermore, cerebellum, brain stem and cerebral white matter, regions that usually show no tracer uptake, also had negative factor loadings. In addition to the factor analysis, we calculated the percentage of each individual region included in a specific tau measure (e.g. a composite ROI or binary mask; see Table 4 ). Regions of which more than 50% were covered by a mask/composite ROI are highlighted in bold in Table 4 .

Parietal and frontal regions received high factor weights in the factor analysis, and also partially contributed to the AD-vulnerable mask and to supra-threshold voxels."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In the current study we evaluated multiple approaches for in vivo quantification and staging of tau pathology measured by AV-1451 PET. In two independent cohorts of cognitively normal and impaired subjects we examined the quantity of tau tracer retention and its location. Braak region-based staging, whole-brain and regional tau measures all showed similar diagnostic accuracies when distinguishing MCI and AD patients from A\u03b2 -cognitively normal elderly subjects (Table 3) . Across the different approaches, key regions vulnerable to tau accumulation included entorhinal, parahippocampal, fusiform, amygdala, inferior/middle temporal, retrosplenial cortex, inferior parietal cortex, precuneus and banks of the superior temporal sulcus (Table 4 ). Our data suggest that global measures can capture tau PET signal in those brain regions and might be eligible biomarkers for classifying tau PET scans as abnormal. However, while all tau measures were related to A\u03b2 and global cognition, whole-brain measures showed weak associations with memory and medial temporal lobe atrophy measures (Fig. 4) . Medial temporal lobe structures are affected early in the neurodegenerative process and previous imaging studies suggest that entorhinal thickness and hippocampal volume are sensitive markers of early AD (e.g. Desikan et al., 2009; Jack et al., 1997) . Thus it appears that while a more global approach performs well for staging and classification, regional tau measures are more sensitive to early neurodegeneration and memory decline.\nThere is emerging evidence from recent tau PET studies that regional tau deposition is closely linked to structural and functional deterioration in aging and AD (e.g. Ossenkoppele et al., 2016; Saint- Aubert et al., 2016; Sepulcre et al., 2016) . Consistent with our findings, Cho et al. (2016) reported strongest correlations between memory scores and medial temporal tau, whereas global cognition was associated with tau in wide regions of the cortex across MCI and AD patients. Similar findings have been seen in cognitively normal adults and AD patients Sch\u00f6ll et al., 2016 ; but see also Brier et al., 2016 for opposite pattern of results). Furthermore, several tau PET studies have shown a close relationship between patterns of tau deposition and atrophy measures (Cho et al., 2016b; Sepulcre et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016) . Sepulcre et al. (2016) reported strongest local-to-local associations between in vivo tau accumulation and gray matter intensities in the anterior medial temporal lobe. Similarly our data revealed strongest correlations of hippocampal volume and entorhinal thickness with tau tracer uptake in Braak I/II ROIs across both samples and further supports that tau deposition closely mirrors neurodegeneration and functional decline.\nTo assess reliability of tau PET biomarkers we ran all analyses in two independent cohorts. Although most tau PET measures yielded similar discrimination based on AUC within each sample, accuracies were overall lower in ADNI compared to BACS/UCSF. Samples differed in demographic and clinical characteristics for both patients and controls. The ADNI sample was much smaller than BACS/UCSF, and in contrast to UCSF patients the majority of ADNI patients were only mildly cognitively impaired. While all ADNI patients were amnestic and mostly above 70 years of age, UCSF patients comprised a variety of AD clinical phenotypes of mostly early age-of-onset. Furthermore, almost 70% of ADNI AD patients were carriers of the APOE \u03f54 allele, whereas the proportion in UCSF AD patients was lower at around 50%. ADNI AD patients had relatively low neocortical tracer uptake ( Fig. 1A; right), and voxel-wise as well as ROI-based analyses revealed highest tracer uptake in the medial temporal lobe extending to inferior temporal and posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortex ( Fig. 3A; right) . In contrast, UCSF AD patients had prominent neocortical uptake across wide regions of the brain ( Fig. 3A; left) . Within UCSF AD patients, early-onset patients showed higher neocortical uptake ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Together these findings are in line with previous observations by Ossenkoppele et al. (2016) ; overlapping data set) that greater AV-1451 uptake in neocortical regions is associated with younger age-of-onset and non-amnestic clinical presentations of AD patients, while greater medial temporal lobe vulnerability is seen in older patients with amnestic symptoms and carriers of the APOE \u03f54 allele. The different characteristics of AD patients are the likely explanation for the lower accuracies in ADNI compared with BACS/ UCSF.\nADNI control participants were younger than BACS subjects. A\u03b2 + controls in ADNI had similarly high tau measures as ADNI AD and MCI patients, and 50% of ADNI A\u03b2 + OC were classified as stage III/IV compared to only 30% of BACS A\u03b2 + elderly control participants.\nAlthough A\u03b2 + OC in BACS had on average higher tracer uptake than A\u03b2 -OC, there was a large range of tau PET values within and overlap between both groups. One explanation for the relatively low tau values seen in some A\u03b2 + BACS participants could be differing A\u03b2 positivity thresholds for PiB vs. Florbetapir. The cutoff for A\u03b2 positivity applied to BACS (PiB DVR > 1.065), which is based on previous results from our lab Villeneuve et al., 2015) , was lower compared to the cutoff used in ADNI (Florbetapir DVR > 1.1) as suggested by a comparative radiotracer study (Landau et al., 2013 Percentage of each region included in a specific mask (sensitive for measuring \"abnormal\" tau). Regions are sorted by Braak stage (low to high) and stages separated by a line. Bold indicates values > 50%. To identify regions that show high tracer uptake (SUVR > 1.4) across both samples, we created an overlap mask between frequency maps. The AD-mask is the overlap of significant t-test results (AD/MCI > A\u03b2 -old controls) between both samples. Factor score weights are shown for the factor explaining most variance derived from a factor analysis on ADNI SUVR data. STS=superior temporal sulcus. Fig. 5 . Key regions identified by factor analysis. We performed a factor analysis to determine the regions that mainly contributed to high global tau signal using a sample of elderly controls, MCI and AD patients from ADNI. Only positive weights for the factor that explained most of the variance are illustrated.\n2014; Sch\u00f6ll et al., 2016) . Regardless of the exact reason, it seems that the two cohorts were different in two important ways: the ADNI cohort AD patients had less neocortical tau than the UCSF AD patients, and the ADNI A\u03b2 + OC had more neocortical tau accumulation than BACS A\u03b2 + OC. These cohort differences likely drive the different sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the varying thresholds we tested. Despite these differences, cutoffs were remarkably similar across cohorts. It is worth noting that, while these cohort differences are important for the ultimate deployment of thresholds and for understanding the biology of the AD pathway, they are not crucial to the conclusions of this study. Our primary aim in comparing the performance of different metrics was not to \"diagnose\" AD, but rather to see how the different metrics perform in different situations. Thus, we chose a simple discrimination -separating A\u03b2 -controls from A\u03b2 + patients -and uniformly compared the metrics. We compared the diagnostic performance of these different measures as an indication of the test characteristics; we do not propose that these results indicate diagnostic accuracy. More work with larger samples and validation with neuropathological data will be needed for this.\nOnly recently has tau PET been incorporated into a proposed biomarker classification system (Jack et al., 2016a) . Classification of individuals as tau 'positive' or 'negative' is relevant for clinical diagnosis, for inclusion of subjects in therapeutic trials, or for studies on normal aging, and the optimal cutoff depends on the context of use. Two previous studies that investigated cut points for AV-1451 tau PET imaging (Jack et al., 2016b; Wang et al., 2016 ) used a similar a priori defined AD-signature ROI to derive SUVR values for classification of subjects. Wang et al. determined an SUVR of 1.19 (applying PVC) and Jack et al. an SUVR of 1.32 (without PVC) as optimal cut points to separate A\u03b2 + AD patients from A\u03b2 \u2212 elderly controls. Using the same a priori ROI as Jack and colleagues, we derived an SUVR cut point of 1.4 with PVC and an SUVR of~1.2 without PVC. Interestingly, most of our approaches converged on a critical cutoff SUVR between 1.2-1.5, suggesting that values above that range might be considered as pathological. Similarly, the percentage of voxels above 1.4 (non-PV corrected) yielded good diagnostic accuracy in both cohorts and was correlated with clinical measures. Applying PVC to the data overall increased cut points (by~.1 SUVR units), a factor that has to be taken into account when cutoffs are applied. We chose to apply PVC because AV-1451 shows strong age-related off-target binding to basal ganglia and choroid plexus as well as binding to skull, meninges and tissue bleeding into neighbored cortical regions (see Baker et al., submitted for publication). However, PVC can also introduce errors which differ according to the correction method employed. We feel that partial volume corrected results should be compared with uncorrected results to evaluate introduction of errors. In our results, accuracies for staging of patients and controls were very similar for non-PVC and PVC data, suggesting that effects of PVC might be small at the group level. However, because off-target binding varies considerably across subjects and is related to age, it might strongly affect the data at the individual level. In addition to the choice of PVC, other factors such as reference region, smoothing filter or normalization to a standard space will impact the exact cut point, and so far no standard processing method for AV-1451 exists. Thus, at this point, thresholds for positivity are likely to be laboratory-dependent.\nOur data suggest that whole-brain tau PET measures might be adequate biomarkers to detect AD-related tau pathology with high specificity, since AD patients usually show tau accumulation in wide areas of the neocortex (Braak stages IV-VI). Regional tau PET measures covering AD vulnerable regions might be more sensitive to detection of early tau pathology, which can be important for therapeutic intervention in clinical trials of preclinical AD or for studies of normal aging. However, a single value and binary classification scheme cannot cover the full spectrum of disease progression. Recent in vivo data (Cho et al., 2016a; Sch\u00f6ll et al., 2016; Schwarz et al., 2016) recapitulated the known ex vivo pattern of hierarchical tau spread described by Braak and Braak (1991) . Thus, a topographical tau PET staging system might better track the gradual expansion of tau accumulation than a binary classification system. We assessed the feasibility of Braak ROI-based tau PET staging in two independent cohorts. Our 4-stage system assigned most young/middle-aged adults to stage 0, most healthy elderly subjects to stage I/II, most MCI patients to stage III/IV and most AD patients to stage V/VI (see Supplementary Fig. S2 ). Increasing Braak stage was related to increasing A\u03b2 and worse cognition and tracer uptake in early Braak regions was related to early structural and cognitive markers of AD, which further supports the concept that the Braak staging system tracks disease progression. An alternative, similar staging system (MeTeRscale), which uses a mesial temporal, temporoparietal and neocortical composite ROIs has been proposed by Villemagne and colleagues (Villemagne et al., 2016) .\nThe transition from normal aging to preclinical AD is characterized by an increase of tau tangles within and spread out of the medial temporal lobe to limbic areas (Braak stage III-IV; see e.g. Petersen et al., 2006) . Consistent with neuropathological data, more than 40% of MCI patients included in our study were categorized as Braak ROIbased stage III/IV (Knopman et al., 2003) . Of all cognitively normal controls, 21% exceeded the threshold for stage III/IV, which is also congruent with neuropathological findings (Braak and Braak, 1997; Knopman et al., 2003) . Notably, the topography of in vivo tau accumulation was remarkably similar between cognitively normal elderly subjects and impaired subjects assigned to stage III/IV, and was characterized by elevated tracer retention in the temporal lobe, posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortex, and parietal cortex/precuneus ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). The same regions have been identified by other studies as being vulnerable to tau accumulation in aging and AD (Brier et al., 2016; Cho et al., 2016a; Delacourte et al., 1999; Schwarz et al., 2016) , and to related functional and structural decline (Dickerson et al., 2009; Saint-Aubert et al., 2016; Sepulcre et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016) . These findings indicate that cognitively normal subjects assigned to a stage of III/IV might be in a transition phase of evolving AD, where tau pathology has not produced any clinically detectable cognitive changes yet.\nIt is also important to note that the peak difference between patients or control subjects assigned to Braak stage III/IV compared to I/II was located in the anterior temporal lobe, encompassing early Braak stage regions such as entorhinal cortex, amygdala and anterior hippocampus. This indicates that tau accumulation is relentlessly progressing in the course of the disease and confirms neuropathological data by Braak and Braak, who found fresh neurofibrillary tangles co-occurring with \"ghost\" tangles across all Braak stages (Braak and Braak, 1997) . This further supports the argument that regions affected early by tau pathology such as entorhinal cortex should be incorporated into regional tau PET biomarkers (as done by Jack et al., 2016b) . While the Braak staging approach encompasses the hierarchical pattern of tau spread with decreasing thresholds from late to early Braak ROIs, it places less importance on the amount of tau within each region and does not capture continued accumulation in early Braak regions. Thus, AD patients with prominent tau deposition confined to the medial temporal lobe might be classified as stage I/II, similar to controls with less uptake, which is one limitation of this approach. As a measure that incorporates both the amount of tau accumulation and its extent, a tsum is a promising tau PET biomarker. A recent study has shown that average AV-1451 tracer uptake significantly varies across regions even in young individuals with expected minimal or no neurofibrillary tangles (Vemuri et al., 2017) , which can be accounted for in a t-score relative to young controls. In our study, the sum of t-values across \"abnormal\" voxels was based on tracer uptake in a very small control group of young and middle-aged subjects, and future studies with larger sample sizes need to further test eligibility of such an approach.\nTo summarize, our study indicates that a number of different approaches to categorize individuals as positive or negative for tau accumulation produce similar results. The similar categorization performance of many of the whole brain measures is undoubtedly related to the finding that all these measures comprise uptake in the key regions vulnerable to tau accumulation largely included in Braak I-IV ROIs or the AD-signature ROI proposed by Jack et al. (2016b) (see also Wang et al., 2016) . While this suggests that whole brain approaches might be similar in the separation of A\u03b2 \u2212 aging from AD, the regional associations with memory performance and brain atrophy suggest that smaller groups of ROIs such as the Braak III/IV ROIs, or even Braak I/II ROIs might be more sensitive to the very earliest stages of tau accumulation seen in the transition from A\u03b2 \u2212 to A\u03b2 + normal aging or MCI. Alternately, uptake in late neocortical Braak stage regions might be more sensitive to the transition from MCI to dementia. Thus, the problem of categorization of subjects as taunegative or positive seems to support many different potential metrics that have similar test performance. However, it seems likely that to define the very earliest stages of tau accumulation, a more fine-grained approach -such as Braak staging or measurement of tau accumulation in specific medial temporal lobe ROIs -may be necessary. The ultimate validation of any of these approaches will require longitudinal observation and neuropathological correlation."}]
