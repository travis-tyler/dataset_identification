Using mutual information-based feature selection, we identify 5 key features optimizing the classification of MCI converters. These features are the left and right hippocampi gradings and cortical thicknesses of the left precuneus, left superior temporal sulcus, and right anterior part of the parahippocampal gyrus. We show that these features are highly stable in cross-validation and enable a prediction accuracy of 72% using a simple linear discriminant classifier, the highest prediction accuracy obtained on the baseline Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative first phase cohort to date.

Measures of neuronal injury and neurodegeneration are among the most important biomarkers of AD (Jack et al., 2012) . Cerebral atrophy caused by the progressive neurodegeneration can be measured in detail by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Anatomic MRI is routinely carried out in clinical practice when diagnosing patients with cognitive disturbances, such as memory problems, to eliminate other possible symptom causes. Thus, atrophy biomarkers based on MRI have a minimal cost impact because MRI scanning is often part of the standard assessment. Optimizing such MRI-based biomarkers for detection and prediction of AD may have a significant impact on early diagnosis of patients and being valuable tools when designing therapeutic studies of individuals at risk of AD to prevent or alter the progression of the disease.\nHippocampal atrophy has long been recognized as an early feature of the degenerative process in AD (Ball et al., 1985) . Reductions in hippocampal volume appear to correspond to early memory decline (De Leon et al., 1989) . Although sensitive, hippocampal degeneration is involved in other dementias, such as vascular dementia (Gainotti et al., 2004) , and is known to be part of nonpathologic brain aging (Driscoll et al., 2003) . Thus, volumetric measurements of the hippocampus (HC) are limited in their ability to predict the progression of AD (Chupin et al., 2009; Clerx et al., 2013; Coup\u00e9 et al., 2012b; Wolz et al., 2011) . Evidence suggests that the nature of degeneration in the HC and surrounding structures, such as the entorhinal cortex (ERC) and parahippocampal gyrus, is different in AD compared with other dementias and different from the changes occurring during normal aging (Devanand et al., 2012) . We have recently obtained results that support this finding; prediction can be improved by considering the structural composition of the HC and its surrounding structures in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) (Coup\u00e9 et al., 2012b) . Our results were obtained using a novel concept of measuring structural similarities, comparing the anatomy of a test subject to a library of AD patients and cognitively normal (CN) subjects.\nStudies have shown that, apart from hippocampal and MTL atrophies, AD has a characteristic neocortical atrophy pattern (Dickerson et al., 2009; McEvoy et al., 2009) . Cortical thinning of temporal and parietal lobe regions, the posterior cingulate, and the precuneus seems to be involved at early stages of the disease (Reiman and Jagust, 2012) . In the advanced stages of the disease, atrophy spreads to almost the entire cortex sparing only the sensory-motor and visual cortices (Eskildsen et al., 2012b) . Recently, we showed in Eskildsen et al. (2013) that if cortical thickness is measured in a consistent manner, patterns of cortical thinning can predict conversion to AD among mild cognitive impaired subjects with higher accuracy (68%) compared with conventional voxel-based morphometry (56%) (Davatzikos et al., 2011) and deformation-based morphometry (64%) (Wolz et al., 2011) .\nIn the present study, we combine measurements of structural pathologic patterns, measured by analyzing morphologic alterations, in key structures of the MTL with degenerative patterns of the neocortex, measured by cortical thickness, to determine if prediction accuracies can be improved further by considering the entire gray matter (GM) atrophy footprint of AD. Moreover, we study the advantage of using feature selection to extract the highest relevant information from a set of potential discriminant features."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants and imaging", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu). The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, positron emission tomography, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessments can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness and lessen the time and cost of clinical trials. ADNI began in 2004 and is ongoing now in its third phase (ADNI2). In this study, we focused on the now completed first phase of ADNI (ADNI1, 2004e2010). For up-to-date information, see http://www.adniinfo.org/.\nIn this study, we selected all 834 ADNI1 subjects available at baseline or screening. Note that only 819 subjects were officially enrolled in ADNI1. However, to compare results with recently published studies on ADNI data (Coup\u00e9 et al., 2012b; Eskildsen et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2012; Wolz et al., 2011) , we decided to conform to the subject inclusion criteria described in these articles. At baseline or screening, 198 subjects were diagnosed as AD patients, 405 had MCI, and 231 were categorized as CN. As done by Wolz et al. (2011) , we determined progressive MCI (pMCI) as those patients who had a diagnosis of AD as of July 2011. The complementary group of MCI patients was considered stable MCI (sMCI). It should be noted that because of study dropouts and to the limited follow-up period, the label sMCI is uncertain for a potentially important group of MCI patients. Table 1 summarizes the cohorts in our study. For our analyses, we used baseline (or screening) T1weighted MRI acquired at 1.5 T only. One of our goals was to determine how well we could predict conversion to AD using only cross-sectional data, as would be the case at the first visit of a patient in clinical practice. AD and CN subject baseline scans were used for extracting image features sensitive to the pathology, thus enabling an independent analysis for sMCI and pMCI populations. Although there were no statistical significant differences in age or sex between AD and CN (age: p \u00bc 0.490, sex: p \u00bc 0.652) and between sMCI and pMCI (age: p \u00bc 0.532, sex: p \u00bc 0.206), it is important to note that there were statistically significant sex differences between the MCI cohort and the AD and CN cohorts. The MCI cohort has a significantly (p < 0.005) lower rate of females. A complete list of the MCI subjects used in the analyses identified by ADNI ID can be found in the supplementary material of Eskildsen et al. (2013) ."}, {"section_title": "Image preprocessing", "text": "All images were processed using a fully automatic pipeline (Aubert-Broche et al., 2013) . Images were denoised (Coupe et al., 2008) using a Rician-adapted noise estimation (Coup\u00e9 et al., 2010) , bias field corrected (Sled et al., 1998) , and registered to Montreal Neurological Institute space using a 12-parameter affine transformation (Collins et al., 1994) . To enable robust registrations, we used as registration target a population-specific template derived from the ADNI1 database constructed using a series of linear and nonlinear registrations as described in Fonov et al. (2011) . The custom template was created from 50 AD and 50 CN randomly selected subjects. This template better reflects the anatomy of ADNI data compared with the conventional ICBM (International Consortium for Brain Mapping) template build from young healthy adults. Image intensities were normalized to match the intensity profile of the template (Nyul and Udupa, 2000) , and finally, the images were skull stripped using BEaST (Brain Extraction based on nonlocal Segmentation Technique) ."}, {"section_title": "Hippocampus and entorhinal cortex", "text": "The Scoring by Nonlocal Image Patch Estimator (SNIPE) method was used to extract structural features of the hippocampal complex (Coup\u00e9 et al., 2012a (Coup\u00e9 et al., , 2012b . In this technique, the local structural information surrounding each voxel (i.e., 3-dimensional patch) of a test subject is compared with those in a library of prelabeled MRI datasets from AD and CN subjects. In short, a small patch of MRI data around each voxel (e.g., 7 \u00c2 7 \u00c2 7 voxel patches) from the test subject is compared with the training library in a nonlocal fashion, with a goal to find similar patches, where similar is defined by the sum of squared intensity differences. The patch similarity is used to compute a weight for the match and used to determine 2 pieces of information. First, the weight is integrated for the different voxel labels in the template library (i.e., background, HC, or ERC) and the label with the maximum weight determines the label of the voxel in the test subject, thus achieving segmentation. Second, the weights are multiplied against the subject group label (AD \u00bc \u00c01.0, CN \u00bc \u00fe1.0) in the template library, and integrated over all matches, to determine if the voxel in question is more similar to the AD group (with a negative integrated score) or the CN group (with a positive integrated score). More specific details are given in Coup\u00e9 et al. (2012a Coup\u00e9 et al. ( ), (2012b . Before running SNIPE, images were cropped around the structures of interest and intensity cross-normalized between the subjects using a histogram-based method applied within the MTL region (Nyul and Udupa, 2000) . We used SNIPE to obtain both grading values and volumes of the left and right HC and ERC of all MCI subjects using the parameters proposed in Coup\u00e9 et al. (2012b) . As detailed in Coup\u00e9 et al. (2012a) , (2012b), the first step to apply SNIPE to the ADNI dataset was to perform a label propagation. This step consisted in propagating a small number of manual segmentations over the entire training library using the segmentation described in Coup\u00e9 et al. (2011) . As in Coup\u00e9 et al. (2012a) , (2012b), we used 20 scans randomly selected from the AD and CN populations (10 CN and 10 AD) for manual labeling by an expert using the protocol described in Pruessner et al. (2002) . Then, these manual segmentations were used to segment the entire AD and CN populations. Finally, HC and ERC segmentations were available for the 231 CN subjects and 198 AD patients constituting our training library. The second step of the SNIPE is the structure grading using automatic segmentations obtained from the propagation step. As proposed in Coup\u00e9 et al. (2012a) , (2012b), the 50 closest subjects were first selected from each training population (i.e., 50 AD and 50 CN) using sum of squared intensity difference over an initialization mask. Then, the grading maps and the segmentations of the considered structure were obtained simultaneously using SNIPE. Finally, the 8 SNIPE-based features extracted were the average grading value over the left and right HC and ERC (see Fig. 1 ) and the volume of the same 4 structures (features 1e8). Volumes were calculated in normalized space (Montreal Neurological Institute space) to avoid bias toward head size."}, {"section_title": "Neocortex", "text": "Cortical thickness was calculated using Fast Accurate Cortex Extraction (Eskildsen and Ostergaard, 2006; Eskildsen et al., 2005) and mapped to the cortical surface of the population-specific average nonlinear anatomic template using an iterative feature-based algorithm (Eskildsen and Ostergaard, 2008) . All AD and CN subjects were used to generate a statistical map of group differences in cortical thickness. From this t map, cortical thickness features were derived with the procedure described in Eskildsen et al. (2013) using the proportion of the cortical surface with the 20% largest t values corresponding to a threshold of t \u00bc 7.4 (see Fig. 2 ). In brief, candidate regions of interest (ROIs) were calculated using a multi-seedeconstrained surface-based regiongrowing algorithm initialized at local maxima of the 20% t map. In Eskildsen et al. (2013) , we found a cortical area of 10%e15% to be suitable for searching for candidate ROIs. In the present study, we decided to increase the threshold, and thereby the search area, to account for population differences between selection and prediction datasets (AD/CN vs. pMCI/sMCI). Note that here, as in the application of SNIPE previously, the feature generation is completely independent of the test data. The CN and AD groups are used to determine the ROIs in terms of cortical thickness, and these are used to evaluate the independent MCI group. A total of 63 candidate cortical thickness ROIs were identified this way (see Fig. 2 ). Neocortical features comprised the mean cortical thickness within each of these ROIs (features 9e71) measured in subject native space."}, {"section_title": "Quality control", "text": "All results were visually evaluated for quality control by an expert, and subjects were excluded if errors were found in one of the image-processing steps mentioned previously.

To select discriminant features, we used a mutual information feature selection (MIFS) method (Battiti, 1994) . In this method, features are selected iteratively in ascending order according to their mutual information score between feature and class and the already selected features. This way features are selected for being informative of the class without being predictable from the current set of features, thus removing redundancy in the feature set. In the given prediction problem, many of the candidate features can be assumed highly correlated, especially as cortical ROIs are spatially close. Thus, we expect the MIFS algorithm to remove many redundant features while keeping the most informative ones. Feature values were standardized before calculating the mutual information. As the selection method does not provide any information of the optimal number of features, we automatically selected features using the MIFS method generating feature sets consisting of 1e30 features to be tested by the classifier. To get an unbiased estimate of the prediction accuracy, we carefully performed feature selection independent of the subject to be classified. This was done in a leave-one-out (LOO) fashion where the feature set optimizing the classification of the training set was used to classify the subject left out. This nested LOO procedure resulted in a specific feature set for each subject. To analyze the stability of the selected features, we recorded how frequent each feature was chosen for optimal classification in the training data."}, {"section_title": "Prediction", "text": "Generated features were used for prediction of MCI subjects using a linear discriminant classifier in the LOO cross-validation procedure mentioned previously. Eight different feature sets were tested: (1) total Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score; (2) long delayed recall score of Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT); (3) all cortical thickness features; (4) all SNIPE features; (5) all imaging features; (6) selected cortical thickness features; (7) selected SNIPE features; and (8) selected features among all imaging features (identified subsequently as the combined feature set). This was done to evaluate the added prediction power of each method and the effect of using feature selection. Prediction using MMSE alone was chosen as a reference as this neuropsychological assessment is widely used in clinical practice for screening purposes and permits comparisons with previous literature using the ADNI database. However, studies have shown that episodic memory may be a better predictor of disease progression (Balthazar et al., 2010; Mormino et al., 2009 ). Thus, we included RAVLT scores for comparison in our analysis. To be of any value, predictions based on imaging should improve the prediction based on cognitive scores alone. In all scenarios, the subject age was included as feature, as our previous results have shown improved prediction accuracies when age is used in combination with structural features (Coup\u00e9 et al., 2012a; Eskildsen et al., 2013) . Table 2 ). The next most selected features were only selected in about quarter of the experiments. In most experiments, 2 features were found to be optimal. This fully automatic feature selection is in line with the results obtained in Coup\u00e9 et al. (2012b) doing an exhaustive search of the optimal combination of SNIPE features. Using cortical thickness features only, the left precuneus were chosen in all cases followed by the left parahippocampal gyrus and an area corresponding to the uncal recess of the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle on top of the HC. In this case, 3 features were found to be optimal for most classification experiments. Interestingly, when applying the feature selection on the combined feature set, the stability of the selected features increased. The same 5 imaging features were selected in almost all experiments. These were left and right HC grading values and cortical thickness of the left precuneus, left superior temporal sulcus, and right anterior part of parahippocampal gyrus. Figure 3 visualizes the cortical thickness features most frequently selected for cortical thickness only and the combined feature set, respectively. The same 5 features were chosen in almost all experiments, making 5 the optimal number of features. Figure 4 visualizes the estimated prediction accuracy using varying number of selected features of the combined feature set. Table 3 lists the results of predicting conversion using the linear discriminant classifier in the 8 different scenarios. Four things should be noted: (1) using just MMSE and age do not provide better accuracy than random selection (p \u00bc 0.07, McNemar test), whereas all other feature sets do (p < 0.05); (2) SNIPE features yield nominally higher accuracies than cortical thickness features, although differences were not significant (p > 0.05, see subsequently); (3) applying feature selection increases accuracy (p 0.003, see subsequently); and (4) the combined selected features reach the best prediction among the tested scenarios, although only borderline significantly better than SNIPE (p \u00bc 0.068, see subsequently). Figure 5 shows the corresponding receiver-operating characteristic curves for the 3 scenarios with feature selection. Using DeLong test for 2 receiver-operating characteristic curves (DeLong et al., 1988) revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) for the combined classifier was significantly different from the AUC of the cortical thickness classifier (p \u00bc 0.027) and almost significantly different from the AUC of the SNIPE classifier (p \u00bc 0.068). AUCs were not significantly different between the SNIPE and the cortical thickness classifiers both with and without feature selection. Using feature selection significantly improved the AUC in all feature sets (p 0.003). Although prediction using RAVLT scores was significantly better than random selection (p \u00bc 0.028), RAVLT was not significantly better than MMSE (p \u00bc 0.31). The classifier using the combined feature set performed significantly better than RAVLT scores (p \u00bc 0.012)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "When using SNIPE features only, the feature selection method selected left and right HC grading values in all LOO experiments", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The results demonstrate that the optimal prediction accuracy can be obtained using a set of few selected features from the MTL, lateral temporal lobe, and the precuneus. Adding further features reduces the prediction accuracy as additional noise is introduced without adding discriminative information. In general, it seems that there are many irrelevant candidates within the cortical thickness features. This might result from that fact that the cortical thickness features are based on statistical differences between AD patients and CN subjects. The same could be said for the SNIPE features as they too were built from AD/CN templates. However, in this case, the features are predetermined and not driven by the AD/CN contrast. Although the t map of cortical AD/CN differences covers the regions involved in early AD, there are also large parts of the cortex that are affected in the later stages of the disease. Therefore, candidate features not suited for the sMCI/pMCI classification are also generated by the feature extraction method. However, the MIFS method (Battiti, 1994) manages to identify a few discriminative ROIs from the 63 candidate ROIs. In the future, we will investigate feature selection based on the sMCI/pMCI differences.\nFrom Table 2 , it can be observed that the same 5 features are selected in almost all the LOO experiments of the combined feature set and that in Fig. 4 these 5 features seem to optimize the prediction accuracy. This indicates that the method proposed to generate and select features is stable and should generalize well to other datasets. The stability of the estimated prediction accuracy (indicated by the small standard error in Fig. 4) indicates that our reported prediction accuracy of 72% is what can be expected in a real clinical prospective setup.\nThe prediction accuracy we obtain for conversion from MCI to AD is nominally higher than most recently published results on ADNI data (Chincarini et al., 2011; Cho et al., 2012; Chupin et al., 2009; Coup\u00e9 et al., 2012b; Cuingnet et al., 2011; Davatzikos et al., 2011; Eskildsen et al., 2013; Gray et al., 2013; Westman et al., 2011 Westman et al., , 2013 Wolz et al., 2011) . Although cohort definitions and sizes vary among studies, our cohort definition is identical to several of these published works (Coup\u00e9 et al., 2012b; Eskildsen et al., 2013; Wolz et al., 2011) . A few studies report slightly higher accuracy than we obtain here (Li et al., 2012; Misra et al., 2009; Wee et al., 2012) . However, these studies are all based on a smaller subset of the cohorts studied here; thus, comparability with the current results is limited. In addition, nonlinear classifiers were applied in these studies, which can potentially lead to unstable feature selection during training (Kalousis et al., 2007) . Here, we demonstrate relatively high accuracy on all baseline ADNI1 data (excluding the 3% failing the image processing) using a linear classifier and few features, which are highly stable when cross validated, imposing more confidence in the selected features. The improvement in prediction accuracy over similar methods based on T1-weighted MRI (Chincarini et al., 2011; Cho et al., 2012; Chupin et al., 2009; Cuingnet et al., 2011; Westman et al., 2013; Wolz et al., 2011) as demonstrated here is likely because of (1) the robustness and consistency of the image-processing pipeline demonstrated by the very low failure rate; (2) the complementarity of the features extracted from the images (MTL and neocortical structures), as the neurodegenerative process in AD occurs across several regions of the brain; (3) the use of a robust and consistent feature extraction method reducing noise in the measurements; and (4) the high relevance of certain features such as HC grading and thickness of left precuneus and left superior temporal sulcus. The selection strategy showed that only a few key features extracted from structural MRI are sufficient for reaching prediction accuracy superior to state-of-the-art methods involving several thousands of features (Chincarini et al., 2011) or involving multimodal features including MRI and positron emission tomography (Gray et al., 2013) .\nStudies to date suggest a natural limit in the prediction accuracy obtained on the ADNI data. No method achieves higher accuracy than we report here on the baseline ADNI1 cohort; thus, one can assume an upper limit of the prediction accuracy well <100%. This limitation may have several explanations. First, because of study dropouts and limited follow-up, the status of a potentially important group of MCI subjects remain unknown; yet, they are all grouped together as sMCI. Second, many MCI subjects may have mixed pathologies affecting their cognitive performance. Thus, subjects not converting to AD may still suffer from other neurodegenerative processes with similar or overlapping atrophy patterns compared with the atrophy pattern of AD. Third, subjects diagnosed as sMCI might still convert to AD in the future, but because they have not done so yet are misdiagnosed as sMCI and confound the analysis. Finally, there is still a high uncertainty attached to the clinical diagnosis of AD. All of these issues will negatively affect the training of a classifier and impair its predictive power.\nContrary to recently reported prediction results on the ADNI data that rely on complex combinations of features (Chincarini et al., 2011; Cho et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012; Wee et al., 2012) , we wanted to have simple interpretable features. This was obtained by selecting a set of features linked to specific anatomic structures (not voxel or vertex level) and not transforming the feature space as done in many feature reduction methods (Brunzell and Eriksson, 2000) . With a small feature set as we report here, it is easier to replicate findings on other cohorts. In addition, by doing feature selection instead of feature reduction, new knowledge can be put into the context of the pathophysiological process of AD.\nThe stability of which the same set of features were selected in the LOO experiments show that these features are measuring key processes involved in early AD. Contrary to other methods (Misra et al., 2009; Wee et al., 2012; Westman et al., 2013) , the features proposed here do not need any normalization or modulation, are stable across sites with well-aligned scanner parameters (e.g., 59 different acquisition sites are involved in ADNI), and do not rely on longitudinal information as they can be obtained from a single T1weighted MRI sequence. It is very important to be able to predict outcome already at patient's first visit. Waiting, for example, 6e12 months for a follow-up scan may unnecessarily delay initiation of crucial neuroprotective therapies.\nThe regions we report to be the most sensitive in predicting AD among subjects with MCI overlaps with atrophic regions identified in early AD (Apostolova and Thompson, 2008; Desikan et al., 2010; Reiman and Jagust, 2012; Vemuri et al., 2008) and are consistent with the Braak stages (Braak and Braak, 1991) . The selection of the left precuneus as a predictive feature for the disease progression is notable. Ishii et al. (2005) showed that GM density of the precuneus was lower in early-onset AD (EOAD) compared with late-onset AD, whereas there were no statistical differences in GM densities in the MTL between groups. EOAD has a more aggressive course and higher pathologic burden than late-onset AD. Although none of the subjects enrolled in our study can be characterized as EOAD, we speculate that atrophy of the precuneus may be a sign that the pathology is taking a more progressive trajectory than those with mainly MTL atrophy. It should be noted that the features selected to optimize the prediction of AD do not reflect the full atrophic pattern of early structural changes. Several potentially pathologically important ROIs correlated with selected regions are excluded by the classifier because of information redundancy.\nThe grading method obtained by SNIPE, although quantified over a single structure, includes information of the surrounding structures. Indeed, although HC grading value is estimated over the HC segmentation only, the involved patch similarity is estimated between patches of 7 \u00c2 7 \u00c2 7 voxels (mm) and thus includes larger structural patterns. Therefore, the HC grading may encode pathologic structures found in the parahippocampal gyrus and other neighboring anatomy. This is further supported by the fact that the feature selection method chose cortical ROIs away from the HC region in the combined feature set, where both the left and right HC gradings were chosen in all experiments. Our results demonstrate that grading values of the HC are compact measures of MTL changes Fig. 5 . Receiver-operating characteristic curves for the linear discriminant classifier on the 3 different feature sets selected using mutual information feature selection. Area under the curve (AUC) is shown along with the 95% confidence interval computed with 2000 stratified bootstrap replicates (Robin et al., 2011). because of disease and captures the early neurodegenerative process in AD yielding relatively high prediction accuracy. This enables even higher prediction accuracy with the support of only a few key cortical ROIs.\nIn line with the previous work (Balthazar et al., 2010; Mormino et al., 2009) , we find that episodic memory seems to be a better predictor of disease progression than global cognitive scores, such as MMSE. However, our results demonstrate that a small set of features extracted from structural MRI significantly improve prediction over neuropsychological tests."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "We demonstrate that AD can be predicted with relatively high accuracy using a small set of key anatomic features extracted from a single T1-weighted MR image. The prediction accuracy of 72% is the highest reported on the entire baseline ADNI1 cohort. The improvement in accuracy is likely because of the application of a novel and compact description of structural changes in the MTL combined with neocortical thickness features and a highly robust image-processing pipeline. Using feature selection based on mutual information leads to the selection of only 5 features highly stable under cross validation. The 5 proposed features are the left and right HC gradings and the cortical thickness of the left precuneus, left superior temporal sulcus, and right anterior part of the parahippocampal gyrus. These are consistent with Braak stages and previously reported atrophic patterns in AD and are easy to transfer to new cohorts and to clinical practice."}]
