INTRODUCTION", "text": "Education contains a teaching-learning process, with a new paradigm that recently known as learning. Understanding of learning is an interaction activity between students and teachers to convey knowledge values and attitudes in the process of education in the classroom. Learning activities in basic education units should be directed so can challenge, give fun, and motivate students to participate, provide creativity enhance independence opportunities to develop students' potential.\nEducation in the 21st century is required to emphasize the critical thinking and problem solving, creativity and innovation, communication, collaboration, and global awareness (Marjohan, 2013: 77) . The five aspects, problem solving or problem solving becomes one of the priority aspects in education. Problem solving is an attempt to find a way out of a difficulty to achieve the previously acquired goals into the new condition. It is said to have problem-solving skills when one is able to identify problems, formulate problems, hypothesize problems, analyze data and find solutions to problems. The goals of Indonesia's education have been in line with the 21st century education priorities.\nAccording to Gunansyah (2015: 9) , each field of study has the domain of teaching materials, namely the knowledge knowledge, skills, and attitude. As the same, with the current 2013 curriculum learning. Although learning now is not separated as in the previous curriculum, but still in one lesson that is in the 2013 curriculum integrated with other subjects. Among them there is a social studies learning content content. In the skill domain in social studies has the goal to develop the skills include: (1) thinking skills that include critical thinking, creative thinking, problem-solving thinking, and decisionmaking thinking; (2) academic skills; (3) social skills; (4) cooperation and participation skills; (5) media and ICT literacy (Information Communication Technology) skills; and (6) communication skills.\nThe results of the PISA (Program for International Students Assessment) and TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study) survey showed that Indonesian students' ability in problem solving is poor. This is evidenced by the data released by both surveys in 2016 that showed the position of Indonesian students in the lowest 10 ranking. Surveys were conducted with the aim of knowing how far students can apply the lessons they have learned.\nProblem-solving skills need to be trained and developed since childhood, especially at elementary school level. Teachers require students to learn and solve problems, but do not provide guidance on how to solve the problem which is part of the problems faced today in teaching (Arend in Trianto, 2011: 66) . The author wants to prove whether the problem occurs in schools that are pilot schools or not. Finally, the author chose Gempol 3 State Primary School Pasuruan as a place to be used as a research location.\nIn a preliminary study conducted on Monday, February 1, 2018 at Gempol 3 State Primary School Pasuruan, the author found the interaction of teachers with students in learning and demanding students to solve problems. In an interview conducted with one of the class V teachers, the teacher conveyed about the conditions at the time of the lesson. Teachers said that the learning methods that are used are lecture, discussion, and question and answer. Teachers rarely involve students directly in solving problems, less related to real life, and poor problem solving strategies are used, making learning less attractive and students feel less challenged while following the lesson.\nFrom the description, the students need to be trained with problem solving skills to be able to resolve if having various social problems that existed in the community. As we know a lot of problems that exist due to economic activities in our country. In theme 8 \"Environment of Our Friends\" there is learning that contains social studies materials. The lesson discusses the economic role of the people's welfare. The material is very closely related to daily life that must be experienced by students. To practice problem solving skills students need an appropriate learning method, one of which is the brainstorming method.\nBrainstorming or brainstorming is a method of collecting large numbers of ideas from a group of people in a short time to express their ideas (Sani, 2014: 203) . The advantages of brainstorming methods are to train students to think actively, to think fast, to be logical, and to increase student participation in receiving lessons (Roestiyah, 2012: 74) . Brainstorming methods can be used in learning activities because it is active, fun and practice problem-solving skills on every lesson. The use of appropriate methods in social studies in teaching materials can support the achievement of learning objectives. Brainstorming methods aimed at combining different ideas from students are then drawn to the conclusion to solve the problem by the students themselves.\nBased on the above description, it can be concluded that learning materials that contain social studies materials also require learning methods that can help students to solve problems. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to apply the brainstorming method to find out whether the method affects the problem-solving abilities of social studies learning subjects. In fullfilling those needs, the research was proposed under the title \"The Influence of Brainstorming Methods on Problem Solving on Content of Social Studies 8th theme \"The Environment of Our Friends\" Gempol 3 State Primary School Pasuruan\".\nAccording Sani (2014: 158) , the method of learning when understood is a way used in implementing the learning strategy that has been chosen. Teacher used the method in learning has aim to create a pleasant learning environment and as a basis for teacher and student activity. According to Hamiyah and Jauhar (2014: 49), methods in learning have scope, among them (1) giving encouragement, (2) creating interest in learning; (3) delivering teaching materials; (4) increasing an atmosphere of learning; (5) fostering creativity; (6) encouraging individual improvement of learning activities and outcomes; and (7) encouraging in refining learning outcomes.\nAccording Sani (2014: 203) , brainstorming methods are a number of ideas gathered from a group of people in a short time. The purpose of the brainstorming learning method is to express what the student thinks thoroughly in response to and solve the problems given by the teacher in the classroom (Roestiyah, 2012: 74) .\nAccording Sani (2014: 204) , in implementing the brainstorming method there are some rules as follows; (1) is prohibited from criticizing; (2) relax and free; (3) focused on the quantity of ideas; (4) record ideas; (5) incubation before evaluating. The stages of brainstorming method when ideas are collected and evaluated are the brainstorming rules and topics studied are explained by the teacher, the notes assigned to record teachers' ideas, the teacher motivates the students in the opinion, the breaks are given, and the minutes show the notes made; and choose relevant ideas by analyzing and evaluating ideas with teacher guidance.\nAccording to Roestiyah (2012: 74) , the advantages of brainstorming methods are opinions expressed by students with active thinking, students are trained to think fast and logical, encourage students to think according to the problems given teachers, student participation in receiving lessons increases, friends and teachers provide assistance for students who are less active, lead to healthy learning competition, students feel happy and free when issuing opinions, and can create an atmosphere of democracy and discipline.\nAccording to Gunansyah (2015: 59) , problem solving provides students with experience to search for and direct issues by using the knowledge and skills they already possess. The purpose of problem solving in the learning process can provide a firm grounding for students to think actively. The indicators of successful in problem solving is to understand the problem, design the solution, the problem is solved based on the plan being made, and the steps that have been done are checked.\nThe essence of Social Studies is an applied science that is very useful because it is able to provide knowledge and a very broad understanding to the students so that later students can interact with the environment, ready to interact with real social life with various social problems, and form a good student personality. The scope of Social Studies learning in primary schools is limited to social issues in daily life. The limitation of the scope of Social Studies aims to adjust the ability of students at every level, because Social Studies has a very extensive study. So for elementary school students a lot of material that introduces about life and social problems that exist in the community in order to later students can be a person capable of addressing every social problem that appears in the surrounding environment. The material is certainly adjusted to the level of ability and interest of students.\nThe purpose of Social Studies in elementary school is to assist and guide students' ability to develop critical and creative thinking skills in order to understand and solve problems that occur in society and to form student personality into good citizens."}, {"section_title": "II.

The use of significance level of 5% because this research is an educational research which does not require high level of accuracy. A significance level of 5% or 0.05 means that in this study 95% of the decision to reject the wrong hypothesis is correct. After writen down all their ideas and ideas, the teacher chooses one of the students who serve as a note. Group representatives convey the results of their discussions in front of the class and the minutes they write their opinions. Students look very enthusiastic follow the learning process. It can be seen from how they follow the learning with passion, actively ask and answer, can not wait forward to convey the results of discussion. After all opinions are written, the teacher gives a five minute break. The activity is continued by evaluating all the answers. Teachers write their answers on the board, then choose, sort, or combine positive and potential ideas. From these activities there are various answers. From this activity, students know that there are many solutions that can be given from a problem.\nAt the end of the lesson, the control class students and the experimental class are given posttest. This posttest to find out student learning outcomes after following the learning process by using brainstorming method.\nAfter doing the research the next step is to perform data analysis of research results. The data obtained in this study are the data of learning outcomes in the form of problem-solving skills of students in charge of the IPS material obtained from a given test item prior to treatment (pretest) and after treatment (posttest). The pretest and posttest issues are the same weighted questions to avoid any effect of the difference in the quality of the instrument from the change of knowledge and understanding of students after the treatment.\nThe test is a five-point description. This test aims to determine the effect that occurs on the results of student problem solving skills on the content of Social Studies material after the treatment in the experimental class group with the control class group as a comparison.

Provision of treatment in the learning process aims to deepen the material of the basic competencies to be achieved. Next data taking is done through the acquisition of pretest and posttest of students on the content of Social Studies about the influence of economic activities on the welfare of the community. The pretest and posttest results were then analyzed using normality test, homogeneity test, t-test, and n-gain.\nHypothesis test is done after it is known that the data is normal and homogeneous distributed by using independent sample t-test. Calculation of t-test can be known if the valuetcount <-ttable and significance <0,05. The t-test calculation shows that tcount -3,900. The t-test value is an empirical t-test value which can be consulted with table t value for df = n-2 that is 59-2 = 57, with 5% significance level is -2.002. From these results it is known that t count is smaller than ttable. (tcount -3,900 <ttable -2.002) and 0,000 <0.05. So it can be concluded that Ho is not proven and hence the hypothesis \"The influence of brainstorming method on problem solving skills on content of Social Studies theme 8 environment of our friend SDN Gempol 3 Pasuruan\" accepted.\nAfter the calculation of the pretest and posttest results of the two classes that become the research sample, in the control class obtained the average value as in the following table: Based on table 9 shows pretest and posttest results of both classes have differences. The posttest result of the experimental class is higher than the control class. Here is a comparison chart of the pretest and posttest results obtained in the experimental class and control class. Based on the diagram above, the result of pretest and posttest values of the two classes is different. It is indicated that there has been an increase of pretest and posttest results from both classes, but a higher increase occurs in the experimental class. Where the experimental class is a class that has been through treatment on learning activities. Treatment is the use of brainstorming methods.\nIn the normalized n-gain test analysis conducted in this study showed that there was an increase in both the control class and the experimental class. The calculation of normalized n-gain test analysis conducted in both classes shows that in the control class there has been an increase of 0.16 with the low category and in the experimental class there has been an increase of 0.64 in the medium category. Although there has been an increase in both classes, the increase in experiment class is higher than the increase in the control class.\nAt the time of the learning process, researchers apply the brainstorming method in the experimental class according to the rules and the existing stages. In the delivery of materials using brainstorming matrices, researchers invite students to interact with question and answer questions and motivate students to express opinions or ideas as much as possible without any criticism. During the process of learning activities, researchers also provide guidance when students have difficulty.\nThe problem solving skills of the students in the experimental class which in their learning use the brainstorming method is better than the control class students who do not use the brainstorming method in their learning. This is in accordance with Roestiyah's opinion (2012: 74) that the brainstorming method has advantages that activate students' thinking to express opinions, train students to think logically, children feel free to create an atmosphere of democracy and discipline. Students have applied previously acquired knowledge into a new, unknown state in finding and resolving a problem.\nBased on the theory of problem solving and the advantages of brainstorming methods, shows that brainstorming methods affect the problem solving with the activity, creativity and experience of students. Because by giving the problem students will understand the problem then the students express an Advances in Social Science, Education and Humanities Research, volume 212 opinion that allows the problem to develop into a new problem or allow for a problem solving.\nBased on data analysis and discussion, it can be seen that there are differences in problem solving skills in the experimental class and control class.
