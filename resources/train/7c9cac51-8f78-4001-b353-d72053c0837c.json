[{"section_title": "First followup survey", "text": "The first followup of NELS:88 was comprised of surveys and tests of students, surveys of teachers and school administrators, and three new componentsthe dropout study, the base-year ineligible study, and the school effectiveness study. Students, augmented by a freshened sample, completed a questionnaire and a series of cognitive tests. The survey gathered information on students' school and home environment, coursework, extra-curricular activities, employment, education aspirations, and self-concept. The test was designed to measure tenth grade achievement and cognitive growth in the period in the same four subject areas as in the base year. The teacher and administrator surveys were administered in the same way as in the base year. A new student supplement was completed by first-time participants, including students who were added to the sample through the freshening process, students who were ineligible in the base year but became eligible now, and base-year nonrespondents who participated in the first followup. The dropout study surveyed and tested youths who had dropped out of school between the spring term of the 1987-88 school year and the spring term of the 1989-90 school year. Students were selected in two stages. The first stage involved the selection of 21,474 students who were in the eighth grade sample in 1988. Since some tenth graders in 1990 were not in the eighth grade or not in the country in the 1988 spring term, a freshening process was used to add 1,043 tenth graders into the sample such that the resulting sample represented the 1990 national population of tenth graders. The base-year ineligible study was added to the first followup to ascertain the 1990 school enrollment status and the 1990 NELS:88 eligibility status of students who were excluded from the base-year survey due to language barrier or disabilities. Because 90 percent of NELS:88 base year students changed schools between 8th and 10th grades, the first follow-up school sample was no longer nationally representative. To sustain analyses of high school issues with longitudinal data, it was necessary to conduct a school effectiveness study in conjunction with the first followup survey. This study involved a sizable and representative within-school student sample that consisted of 248 NELS:88 schools from 30 major metropolitan areas. As participants of the first followup, these schools cooperated in additional data collection for the school effectiveness study. 3."}, {"section_title": "Second followup survey", "text": "The second followup repeated all components of the first followup, re-included the parent component, and initiated two new componentsthe transcript and course offerings components. The course offerings component was implemented as a part of the school effectiveness study. The transcript component was undertaken for sample members who were students attending sampled schools in the spring of 1992, all dropouts, dropouts in alternative programs, early graduates, and \"triple ineligibles\" (those 1988 eighth graders who were ineligible for the base year, first followup, and second followup due to language barriers or disabilities). The student component again consisted of a questionnaire and a series of cognitive tests. The questionnaire focused on planning for postsecondary education and work, among other topics. The test measured twelfth grade achievement and cognitive growth in the same four subject areas. The student questionnaire contained a supplement for early graduates, which tapped the reasons for 4 NELS:88 Research Framework and Issues 1 ,; Overview of NELS:88 Database and circumstances of early graduation. From first-time participants in NELS:88 (either via the freshening process or the ineligible study), another supplement questionnaire collected demographic background data. While teachers and administrators were surveyed again, only one teacher for each studentrather than two as in previous waveswas asked to participate. Each student and dropout selected for the first followup was included in the second followup. From the schools attended by the sample members, 1,500 schools with 12th grade were included into the school sample. All components were completed in 1,374 schools, but only the student and parent questionnaires were administered in the remaining 126. The student sample was then freshened to provide a representative sample of students enrolled in the 12th grade during the spring term of the 1991-92 school year. The second followup school effectiveness study included 247 participating schools. The sampling process involved freshening and additional selection of students.

For example, the status of a student surveyed as an eighth grader could change several times between the base year and second followup (e.g., student in 1988, dropout in 1990, and student in 1992). By the time this student was surveyed in 1994, he/she might have completed high school, earned a GED, or still not have a high school diploma. The above example is further elaborated in figure 1 which presents the statuses (and numbers) of NELS:88 sample students who followed selected paths as of the second followup. For example, out of 20,062 students (column 1) who were sampled in the base-year and retained in the first followup surveys, 18,270 (column 2) were classified as students in the first followup. Of these 18,270 students, 16,885 (column 3-69 + 16,339 + 11 + 466) were classified as students during the second followup.

Users of NELS:88 data will be able to study the effect of a wide variety of factors on students' educational and professional attainment. The longitudinal data gathered from students, and augmented through parent, teacher, school administrator, and school record of students' progression and development (for example, academic transcripts), will facilitate scrutiny of various facets of students' lives and permit examination of the relationships of these factors on social, behavioral, educational, and vocational development. 2."}, {"section_title": "Cross-sectional analysis", "text": "The second analytic type within NELS:88 is cross-sectional. By beginning with a cross-section of 1988 eighth graders, following a substantial subsample of these students at two-year intervals, and freshening the 1990 and 1992 samples to obtain representative national cross-sections of tenth and twelfth graders, the study also provides a statistical profile of America's eighth graders, high school sophomores, and high school seniors. 3."}, {"section_title": "Cross-cohort comparison", "text": "Finally, NELS:88 has been designed to provide researchers with data for drawing comparisons with previous NELS-sponsored longitudinal studies. To facilitate cross-cohort comparisons, many of the content areas and related questionnaire items contained in the NLS-72 and HS&B surveys were repeated in NELS:88 surveys. The comparability and consistency of items across these three data sets allow us to conduct, among others, the following trend analyses: NELS:88 1990 sophomores (with freshening) can be compared to HS&B 1980 sophomores; NELS:88 1990 (with freshening) sophomores two years later (that is, in 1992) can be compared to HS&B 1980 sophomores two years later (in 1982); NELS:88 1990 (with freshening) sophomore cohort dropouts (as of 1992) can be compared to HS&B 1980 sophomore cohort dropouts (as of 1982); NELS:88 1992 seniors (with freshening) can be compared to HS&B 1980 seniors and NLS-72 1972 seniors; and Analysis Perspectives NELS:88 collected high school transcripts can be compared to HS&B 1982 collected high school transcripts. Comparisons are also possible using transcript data collected for 1987 and 1990 high school graduates in NAEP schools. Table 1 summarizes the types of trend comparisons possible. "}, {"section_title": "Level of Analysis", "text": "Both descriptive and relational analyses can be conducted with NELS:88 data. Descriptive analyses, often used to summarize education conditions, can be used to produce a snap shot of statistics for one year or statistics across years. For example, achievement test results can be generated for a given year or for cross years. They can also be presented in comparison to earlier cohorts at the same grade level; for example, achievement by tenth graders from the class of 1990 in NELS:88 first followup and tenth graders from the class of 1980 in HS&B. Such analyses may suggest trends of achievement growth across cohorts. Relational analyses usually seek to identify the relationships between an outcome variable and the variables that theoretically influence the outcome. This can be done in either cross-sectional or longitudinal designs. Results from cross-sectional analyses can be generalized to the national population because the NELS:88 student sample was freshened in each wave to represent the national population at a given grade level. The longitudinal design, in which the main sample of the cohort was followed throughout the first four waves of the survey, allows researchers to ascertain relationships between antecedent variables (e.g., demographic background and coursework) and outcome variables (e.g., high school completion and college attendance). Furthermore, cross-cohort analyses make it possible to see how the relationships revealed by relational analyses based on either cross-sectional or longitudinal designs changed in the past decades. For instance, with data from NLS-72, HS&B, and NELS:88, we can examine how the relationship between high school course taking and college entrance changes among high school graduates of 1972, 1980, and 1992. C."}, {"section_title": "Unit of Analysis", "text": "By design, the basic unit of analysis for most NELS:88 analyses is the student. The school administrator, parent, and teacher data can be thought of as providing contextual data (e.g., background, school characteristics, opportunity to learn). The exception to this rule is the baseyear school file. Because the base year of NELS:88 involved the random selection of 1,000 schools from across the nation, the eighth-grade school sample can also be considered to be a stand-alone file in that the basic unit of analysis can be the school. This is not true of the first and second followup school files, however. These schools were selected because they contained students who participated in NELS:88 during the base year. Using common IDs, the individual data files comprising NELS:88 can be merged with each other to form working data files containing student, parent, school, and teacher data.

Within each area, specific research issues as identified by NCES staff and the conference participants are listed. For each issue, a short summary is presented, providing information on 1) the significance of the issue to policy making, 2) addressability using NELS:88 data, and 3) possible cautions due to methodological complications. The amount of detail provided in each summary varies. For some areas where much research has already been conducted, the summary statements tend to be longer and more detailed. In other areas, less research had been conducted and thus the summary may point to the need for future research. In these areas, ideas rather than results of past research are presented. A listing of relevant literature is included for most research issues. The citations cover only research that used NELS:88 data and that were published into 1995. Note that NELS:88-based research regarding postsecondary education and later transition is scant in the literature. This is because NELS:88 data on postsecondary education, collected in the third followup, are being processed and are not yet publicly available. Readers should consult other sources of literature to develop theoretic and technical understanding of those research issues. A."}, {"section_title": "Secondary Education", "text": "NELS:88 was designed to study the transitions students experienced as they moved from eighth grade to high school.

NELS:88 has improved its tests, particularly the mathematics test, by taking an adaptive test approach whereby both mainstream and disadvantaged students have opportunity to show their cognitive growth. Their test gains, however, tend to be in different areas: high ability students may gain in problem solving skills whereas disadvantaged students may gain in repertory skills. Because their gains may look similar on the aggregated scale, it is necessary to differentiate gains at different proficiency levels in performing analyses. To identify the process in which the achievement gains take place, one can use transcripts to examine the courses taken by students Summary of Research Issues instruction features to test scores that reflect the outcome of two years. In addition, measurement of instruction tends to be overly simplistic. For instance, in science instruction, the more time spent in classroom discussion, the less time spent in hands-on experiments, but both are crucial for effective science learning. If we only look at one activity's correlation with the outcome, the complex process of instruction and learning can be misleadingly simplified. The instruction data are promising, but need to be handled cautiously in analysis. Relevant literature Bobbitt, S.A. (1993).

Issue: Opportunity to learn (OTL) with alternative definitions to distribution of OTL across student groups Alternative definitions for OTL may use a variety of variables including content of instruction, instructional strategies, resources and expenditures, availability of technology, staff quality, and compensation. These alternative definitions can be used to examine the differential distribution of OTL by student needs. A question that can be asked is how tangible resources (e.g., money and technology) lead to shaping a positive learning environment, which further leads to higher achievement. The results from such an examination can help policymakers and the administration monitor the condition of OTL. NELS:88 contains a large number of data items to tap OTL.  Issue: Academic growth profiles to related background and curriculum factors Study of academic growth conceptualized as group profiles can typify growth rates and the shape of the growth curve differentiated by important school and sociodemographic factors. More responsive instruction can be developed according to meaningful growth profiling. Particularly interesting will be growth profiling at high proficiency levels, as the results will reflect the learning of problem solving skills (one of the Goals 2000). With NELS:88 test score gains, three growth profiles can be generated: (1) \"early accelerated growth,\" which includes students who made their biggest gain between grades 8 and 10, (2) \"later accelerated growth,\" which refers to those who gained more between grades 10 and 12, and (3) \"constant growth,\" which covers those who made about the same gains across the four year NELS:88 Research Framework and Issues 17 2; Summary of Research Issues period. The three profiles can then be correlated to background (e.g., SES, sex, and locale) atici schooling (course work, curriculum, and school policies).

Issue: Teacher characteristics, teacher-student interaction, and school performance Study is needed to focus on personal interaction and relationships between teachers and students in elementary and secondary schools. Instruction and learning can be studied by examining the teacher-student relationship. Teachers' evaluations and expectations regarding student efforts and performance on one hand, and students' perceptions about classroom instruction and teacher attitudes on the other, are jointly responsible for the outcomes. Research on the issue is important for pedagogy improvement. A unique strength of NELS:88 data is the link between data about student learning collected from teachers and data about instruction collected from students. This feature allows researchers to delve into the processes in which teaching influences students' perception on instruction and learning, and such perceptions in turn affect performance. Caution: Teachers' responses to pedagogical questions probably cover a period (usually a semester or one year) shorter than the two-year time span in which the followup took place. Thus, the information provided by the teacher may not fully reflect the pedagogical effects on the student outcomes in the two years.\nChaney, B. (1994).

In Issue: Home environment and family support for learning in relation to student motivation, learning approach, and education outcomes The dilemma facing public schools in teaching values and behavior leaves family a major role to play in guiding and supporting students to learn. Available research suggests that the family helps form children's values, aspirations, and expectations that are essential for achieving academic excellence. These influences, as cultural ingredients, are exerted in the home setting by senior members of the family. Understanding how home environment and school factors jointly affect student learning and behavior can contribute to policymaking and program development for parental involvement. NELS:88 contains a wealth of data for scrutinizing home environment; for example, family composition and family members (parents, siblings, and other relatives), home language, family rules regarding children's behavior and activities, parents' expectations for children, interaction between parents and children, family activities conducive to learning and achievement (e.g., Lee, V.E., Burkam, D.T., Zimiles, H. & Ladewski, B.

How does community participation in school decisionmaking help improve school performance? Do children have a sense of attachment to the community? The community or students' immediate neighborhood may influence students' behavior, aspirations, and educational performance to a great extent. And such community influences are particularly intense in disadvantaged urban neighborhoods and isolated rural places. However, the community-school relationship and its impact on school outcomes is probably one of the weakest areas in education research. Merging NELS:88 data with Census and CCD data offers opportunities for dealing with these issues. The research can be oriented to developing both policy and theory.

These groups have different needs and learning approaches, and face different school environments (school resources and climate) and variant opportunities to learn (e.g., course content, amount, and instruction strategies). Two student populations in particular concern researchers. One is students in urban areas, surrounded by violence and poverty; the other is Hispanics with extremely low literacy. The two populations are growing rapidly and pose serious policy questions relating to their education. NELS:88 offers information for studying the two groups, with oversampling of Hispanics. Many pressing issues related to the two groups can be addressed.  (1994). What do student grades mean? Differences across schools. Washington, DC: Author. Schneider, B. & Shouse, R. (1992).

Using the NELS:88 State Augmentation File that provides data with additional samples for five states, researchers can perform state-to-state or state-to-nation comparisons. While the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) survey provides cross-sectional assessment data, the NELS:88 longitudinal design (following the same cohort of students) enables researchers performing state analysis to look at more specific policy factors that may explain the outcome differences within or across states. The results of such studies may go beyond the scope of an aggregated \"report card\" and pinpoint problems contributing to equity in specific states.

Student behavior normally is highly stable (e.g., disciplining, engagement) and impacts academic outcomes. Student misbehaviors (including absence or truancy, violence, drug use, and crime) can be studied to identify community and school conditions which may be responsible for behavioral problems or that contribute to school order. It may be also interesting to examine the relationship between misbehavior and other psychosocial problems such as impaired self-concept and emotional disorder (see the issues in number 2. Self-Concept, Locus-of-Control, and Social Behavior under Motivation, Aspiration, Self-Concept, and Other Psychosocial Issues). For both practitioners and policymakers, knowledge on these issues will be valuable. NELS:88 provides data on problem behavior and school discipline measures (reported by students) which can be linked to school performance; the school survey contains data on school policies and efforts for discipline which can be related to student reported misbehavior. Issue: The impact of retention on student performance Controversial as it is, retention is a measure intended to, by repeating the grade, help students meet academic achievement requirements after they fail at the current grade level. Critics argue that this approach works against its intended goal: instead of helping retained students, it damages students' self-esteem and academic motivation, and makes these students fall further behind. Because retention happens more often to disadvantaged students, the joint effect of retention and other risk factors may push students to eventual school failure. Many issues in this connection, however, remain unclear. For example, is there a uniform negative effect of retention on later achievement? If not, what are the differential effects of retention on different student groups (e.g., gender, race, or students with specific disabilities)? Does the timing of retention (e.g., in middle school versus high school) make differences to the outcomes? What are alternative ways to help students who temporarily fail in school? Two types of information on retention are available in NELS:88. Transcript data from eighth grade to high school senior reflect retention experiences in middle school and high school. Parent recollection of experience of retention at each grade level from kindergarten to seventh grade is another source for checking early retention. With data on student background and school outcomes, a variety of retention related issues can be addressed. Caution: Retrospective data collected from students or parents on early experiences of retention should be handled with caution, and perhaps be checked against transcript data. Issue: Academic resilience and school experience among disadvantaged students Not all disadvantaged children fail in school. Some of them are highly successful in secondary and college education and many manage to acquire basic literacy and to function in society. For practitioners and researchers alike, it is interesting to understand how academic resilience is developed against the odds of a disadvantageous environment. Children of racial or language minorities, families in poverty, and schools in inner cities or remote rural areas, for example, may be considered at education disadvantage. Studies are needed to learn about the process in which institutional, community, and family conditions work with personal characteristics to develop resilience and academic success. These conditions may interact with one another and jointly contribute to subsequent school performance and personal development. With the NELS:88 oversampling of certain disadvantaged groups (Hispanic and Asian students), a reasonably large number of resilient students can be identified for analysis. Drawing data about school, family, and student personal experience, NELS:88 makes it feasible to examine the resilience issue. Attention should be focused on the interaction patterns in which school, family, and the student's personal effort affect outcomes."}, {"section_title": "NELS:88 Research Framework and Issues", "text": "Issue: The causes and the long-term effects of teen parenthood Teen sex, pregnancy, and parenthood not only affect students' academic achievement but also affect their adult lives. In connection to the proposed welfare reform, research into the causality and the long-term effects of teen parenthood is highly significant. For example, what is the impact of teen pregnancy on high school completion and postsecondary educational attainment? How effective are programs of sex education and pregnancy prevention in reducing the problem? What is the effect of family/parental involvement in both preventing and coping with the eventuality? What kind of role do peers play in the process? NELS:88 systematically collects data on dating, sexual behavior (e.g., first time sex, the number of partners, and use of contraception), knowledge about sex and pregnancy, pregnancy, and child bearing. Data on school programs dealing with teen sex and pregnancy are available as well. The longitudinal design makes it possible to examine the effectiveness of programs and the consequence of teen pregnancy. Summary of Research Issues NELS:88 and HS&B contain many comparable measures of academic achievement, student demographics, and grouping by program/curriculum. Such comparability enables intercohort analysis of achievement gap relating to SES background and curriculum grouping. The analysis can clarify whether or not the achievement gaps between curriculum groups and demographic groups have widened in the last decade when education reform has been on the national agenda. Group differences in learning on specific subjects (e.g., math and science) for the same grade span (e.g., from sophomore to the senior year) of the two cohorts, measured with standard deviation units, can be compared. A partition analysis used by demographers can partition cohort differences into three components: difference due to demographic shifts, difference due to educational reform (e.g., policies and curriculum), and difference due to the interaction of the two. Issue: Studying systemic reform of school with econometric modeling Education reform calls for schools to produce high quality graduates with limited resources. To achieve school effectiveness, administrators and policymakers need to understand the process by which variables of involved parties (the district, school, teachers, and students) jointly determine the final outcomes (i.e., students of high achievement and responsible citizenry). An econometric modeling approach can be applied to scrutinize the factors operating in the reform. NELS:88 with its comprehensive coverage of relevant data and longitudinal design makes econometric modeling possible. Such models address learning environment/ process (including both classroom conditions and broader institutional reform) and performance outcomes. This approach not only involves multilevel modeling (such as in HLM) but also allows simultaneous estimating to predict the outcomes with multilevel path analysis. Some ongoing studies are already attempting this: with teacher-student paired data and school-level data, by modeling science teaching and learning, and with simultaneous three-level path analysis to predict science education outcome. With \"switches\" in the model (i.e., variables that are important theoretically or closely related to policymaking and that can be manipulated in the analysis), one can use the model to see how these variables affect the outcome and use the models for decision-making. Caution: A constraint to such analyses with NELS:88 data is that the sample did not have enough students in each class, nor enough classes in each school. It is only possible to model two levels, the student and the school. Aggregating classroom data into the school level may lessen or confuse the effects of instruction/curriculum variables.

Issue: The effectiveness of restructured social services in the school and community Integrated services is a new strategy for dealing with multiple problems facing disadvantaged students and families. How has this approach worked so far? With what kind of problems or student groups has integrated services worked more effectively? Answers to these questions are helpful for improving practice and decisionmaking on program administration and planning. With data from recent years, NELS:88 may be able to help address some of the questions. Issue: The impact of national or state standards for academic achievement The notion of national standards that hold high expectations for all children are controversial. Critics say that standardization simply adds bureaucratic procedures to the already ineffective system and forces students with diverse backgrounds to learn skills irrelevant to the needs of the local labor market and community. Empirical evidence is required to show whether high standards actually help schools raise their performance through accountability. NELS:88 data allow such research. Outcome measures are available for students with different prior performance. Student and school background, resources, technical support, and incentives for achieving the standards also can be examined to isolate the effects of standardization. Study can compare the achievement outcomes of schools that have adapted state standards or some form of national standards and those that have not. Caution: Data on state standards and on school adaptation of standards may be insufficient. Additional data are probably needed from state governments."}, {"section_title": "5.", "text": "Parent/Community Involvement Issue: The functions of market mechanisms and parents' \"choice\" of school that increase school competition for student enrollment Research is needed to find out how to empower parents so that they can exercise real influence in school policymaking and operation. Some market mechanisms have been introduced to increase the competition for students among schools in order to improve school efficiency. Parents' \"choice\" of school is a key element in the proposed change. Has this competition mechanism worked to strengthen parents' influence and to improve school accountability? Many are skeptical about this.  Knowledge about the effectiveness of parental support and how to advise parents to use appropriate approaches can help schools develop better strategies for involving parents. With NELS:88 data gathered from students, teachers, and parents, in-depth study into parental involvement is possible."}, {"section_title": "Student Mobility", "text": "Issue: Student transition: continuing versus dropping out of school, transferring across schools or school sectors, and other issues related to student mobility Over the years of secondary schooling, especially between middle school and high school, a substantial portion of students experience transitions that often cause stress and influence students' later education: early dropping out can happen during the transition, some students change from public to private schools or vice versa, and most students change their schools as they upgrade from middle school or junior high into high school. Some families move and students are relocated into different schools. Administration imposed transition may take place in such forms as school consolidation and district rezoning. Learning about the complicated patterns of student transition and subsequent school experience is helpful for improving administration and planning to reduce difficulties facing mobile students."}, {"section_title": "Summary of Research Issues", "text": "NELS:88 tracks students' transitions; the resulting high sample attrition rates provide data for such studies. The school is a social organization with diverse administrative structures, varying sizes of staff and enrollment, changing policies, and distinct institutional cultures. It is a challenge to education research to understand how school works to achieve equity and excellence. Systematic studies focusing on school as an institution are framed in different intellectual perspectives (e.g., in economic models, school is an input/output production process; in sociological theories, school is a structured arrangement wherein groups and individuals interact). Relevant to policy analysis, school sector (public versus private), size, socioeconomic conditions of the community, administrative approach, policies and climate are all important concepts. NELS:88 offers school data including school demographics (e.g., enrollment, student/staff racial/ethnic composition, sector, and locale), school facilities, school regulations and rules, program offerings, and school climate as perceived by teachers and students. Data were collected from administrators, teachers, parents and students. Linking data about school resources and climate with data on student performance, economic models can be applied. Linking different sources of data about school culture (e.g., students' perception about school climate and studentteacher relationships, teachers' perception about student behavior and school administration), social psychological concerns can be addressed.\nIssue: Test indicator scales with the multilevel structural equation technique The indicator systems can be studied with multilevel structural equation modeling (with packages such as LISREL or PRE LIS). This approach, combining the strength of multilevel regression and path analysis techniques, promises to model student achievement by taking into account the fact that differences in policies and practices occur at the school and classroom levels. The model can be used to validate the indicators and to study the effects of changes in policy-related variables on achievement. Ongoing research has explored science achievement modeling and the related indicator system. These studies examine the existing items in NELS:88 achievement scales to see how they differentially reflect the underlying concepts and how they are related to policy-relevant variables. Such studies can help refine the indicator systems by making them more sensitive to policy variation while increasing survey efficiency. Besides cognitive tests, other indicator systems, such as those for school climate, student self-esteem, parental involvement, and academic motivation can be considered. NELS:88, HS&B, NLS-72 contain such multi-item scales. PRE LIS or other sophisticated software is needed to examine both construct validity and reliability. PRE LIS does confirmative factoring based on some theoretical constructs. Examining the factor correlation matrix resulting from LISREL can help eliminate some trivial items that load little on the conceptual construct. The approach is a solid way to test a hypothesis since some theoretic presupposition was imposed upon the data. Caution: The small number of students nested in each classroom (which in turn is nested in each school) in the NELS:88 sampling design makes it impossible to deal with between-classroom differences. Another problem is related to the theoretical basis of such modeling. We assume a common factor structure across all schools in considering school policies and school climate. But, in reality, the structure can vary across schools. There may be different underlying factors for the notion of school climate (not just differences in the magnitude of factor loadings of items) depending on different school types (e.g., private versus public, disadvantaged versus advantaged). To allow the school level variables to vary and to investigate the implications of such school-level variance, we may want to do separate multilevel factor analysis with different types (groups) of schools. This way we can see different climate factor structures in different types of schools. Future research should consider this important issue."}, {"section_title": "Relevant", "text": "While NELS:88 has not maintained its school sample as nationally representative after the base year, a School Effectiveness Study was added to the first followup to provide a nationally representative sample of 10th and twelfth grade schools. This supplementary project sustains longitudinal school-level analysis. Caution: In followups, schools are no longer a focus of sampling design because of complicated student transitions after middle school. Therefore, school weighting needs to be developed (see the first issue of number 2, Research on Sampling Problems, in Methodological Research) if school is the unit of analysis.

The transition may involve a series of events, such as high school completion, dropping out, or acquisition of alternative credentials such as the GED; labor force participation, employment, and occupational advance; and participation in adult education or other on-the-job training. Understanding the transition process entails studies on such themes as education/career aspirations, information access and planning, labor market adjustment, and career decision making. Transition data were collected in the NELS:88 third followup in 1994 and are currently being processed. While comparable to NLS-72 and HS&B, NELS:88 will allow broader coverage of issues relevant to postsecondary issues because other data sources can be integrated into NELS:88. For example, occupational attainment studies require data on local economic conditions and the labor market context, which are available by merging NELS:88 files with CCD and Census data with the common ID numbers. The school level or household level data will also be available on CD-ROM. Thus, opportunity for research on postsecondary issues is enhanced substantially with NELS:88 data."}, {"section_title": "1.", "text": "High School Completion, GED, and Dropout Issue: High school completion/dropout and related individual, school, and community factors High school completion is a basic requirement for an individual to function in today's labor market. Without a high school credential, one would face significantly higher risk of low-pay employment, unemployment, and dependency on public assistance. High school dropping out, in some research, is related to not only individuals' failure in the labor market, but also to institutional consequences such as a loss of local or state tax revenue and an increase of public service costs. Comparative study of high school completion/dropout rates across demographic groups and regions are thus an important undertaking for policymaking purposes. NELS:88 has improved the data quality on dropping out of school. All known dropouts were sampled with certainty in followups. Data were collected by administering questionnaires in the presence of project staff or via telephone interview. With data on school and community, it is possible to do comparative analysis of school completion/dropout rates and to link the differences to an array of individual, school, and community variables. \nData Quality and Measurement Issue: Data validating Data validating is a pressing issue for improving NCES data quality. Research has found problems in data validity, problems which were caused by irregular responses or inappropriate instrument design. African American male students tend to provide irregular responses to surveys to a much greater extent than other students. Social desirability can undermine data validity. Different or conflicting views on school issues are held by students, teachers, and parents; the perceptions of low ability students and high ability students differ. The meanings of such responses should be S0 NELS:88 Research Framework and Issues J J Z; sorted out. Such efforts can help improve survey design within relevant theoretical or policymakirig frameworks. With its comprehensive data contents and multiple data sources (students, teachers, parents, and administrator), NELS:88 should be subject to data validation. For example, 99 percent of the teachers in the survey answered that they stressed critical thinking skills, but we know that is not the case. Checking against student responses to questions on classroom process may help figure out the instructional reality. A \"convergent\" approach, in which the same information is collected from different informants (the student, his/her teacher and parents, and the school administrator), would enable researchers to examine data validity. Such a data validating process can also generate information to determine the best possible sources and best possible questionnaire items on specific issues for future survey design.

The rates of labor force participation among this population, however, differ across geographic areas and student groups. The timing of entry also varies: some students start part-time work while still in school, others begin after graduation or after further delay. A substantial number of youth do not participate in the labor force after school due to child bearing or other difficulties. Finally, the nature of labor force participation differs (e.g., temporary job versus permanent career, part-time versus full-time; working while going to school versus working without plans for college). Initial wages and working conditions differ as well. The differential processes of labor force entrance have important implications for examining and crafting education and labor policies. NELS:88 contains data on student employment before high school (in the base year to the second followup). Data on employment after high school are covered in the third followup. All together, there is information about labor force entry, timing, weekly hours, wages, job changes and changes in labor force participation status. Issue: Employment, occupational performance, and participation in public assistance programs Policymaking can be informed by studies of the employment experiences of high school graduates (and nongraduates) after they enter the labor force. These experiences include occupational performance and career advance during employment, changes in income, experience of unemployment, and receiving public assistance. Analyses focusing on differences across demographic groups or geographic areas will be particularly valuable for advising the current reform of the employment and welfare services and other social services programs. Issue: The effect of high school curricula on rural-to-urban migration The rural-to-urban migration of educated youth is an important issue in rural communities. Some critics contend that the establishment of public schools is actually leading educated rural youth to move out of the community and hence contributes to the decline of rural America, because the established curriculum is oriented only to the urban labor market. It is not clear what kind of high school curriculum can help foster community attachment and construct the meanings of rural life as well as teach skills to meet the local needs.

Issue: Community colleges' growing and changing role in education Community colleges are growing into an important and increasingly diverse component in the nation's postsecondary education system. It is necessary for policymaking purposes to know the multiple roles played by community colleges, including academic/vocational/technical training, adult and continuing education, service to underrepresented groups and disadvantaged areas, and local cultural and developmental activities. Institutional characteristics should be examined to see how they are associated with high rates of student retention or transference to four-year programs and high enrollment of disadvantaged groups. NELS:88 and the NCES higher education surveys (IPEDS, B&B, RCG, and BPS) contain institutional data. Statistics can be generalized to the national population from the representative institutional samples (except that from NELS:88, which did not sample institutions after the base year)."}, {"section_title": "Attainment of Professional and Graduate Education", "text": "Issue: Choice of and entry into professional and graduate education programs Recent years have witnessed a significant increase of women and minority enrollment in professional and graduate education programs. The distribution of women and minority students across major academic fields (e.g., science/engineering, social sciences/humanities, medicine, law, and business administration), however, is not even. It is interesting to study gender-or racedifferentiated enrollment of graduate programs by relating advanced program attendance to secondary and undergraduate college experience. A host of important questions can be asked: What motivates students to go into advanced programs? What is the impact of high school coursework on the choice of specific professional/graduate programs? When and how did the gender/race differences in academic field selection emerge? Why do some students change their fields between undergraduate and graduate programs? What are the financial sources for advanced studies and how does financial support influence program choice and completion? NELS:88 will collect data relevant to these questions in its fourth followup in 1998. The advantage of NELS:88 data (relative to the NCES higher education surveys) is its long range of data collection from middle school up to postgraduate education. In-depth studies can be formed to address issues related to professional and graduate education. Issue: Aspiration, choice, and completion of advanced programs in science and engineering It has been documented that, in the past decades, students' aspiration for and performance in science/engineering learning is declining. To maintain the nation's strong foothold in the global technological and economic competition, graduate education in science and engineering has a vital role to play. Studying the experience of students who are motivated to and succeed in advanced science/engineering training may shed light on policymaking and program planning aimed to improve high level training in these fields. Relevant to the issue of equity, study of graduate experience in science and technology training among traditionally disadvantaged groups is also needed. It can inform decisionmaking regarding resources and incentives for encouraging science/engineering studies among disadvantaged groups. Again, with its rich data on student background, family and community, earlier stages of schooling, and college education, plus the to-be-collected data on graduate training, NELS:88 will be a promising source for research on graduate education and the career paths of scientists and Motivation, Aspiration, Self-Concept, and Other Psychosocial Issues Social psychological study of student motivation, aspiration, self-concept, attitudes, and perceptions has accumulated a large literature.

Among minority students, aspirations can be examined against the reality (their academic performance and lifestyle, access to information about opportunities for higher education, and their parents' expectations and planning). How do students' \"realistic\" aspirations affect postsecondary outcomes? Some incongruency is often found among African American students.

What is the role of family and community in encouraging students to study math and science? Some integrated theoretical models (e.g., educational productivity model) are available to guide systematic research on both the cognitive and psychosocial effects of learning. NELS:88 provides relevant data for such studies, including peer values regarding academic learning in general and specific subjects; communication with peers, teachers, parents, and other significant others; and frequency and time spent with friends. Relating these data with data on students' likings, aspirations, and learning processes on math and science, as well as the influences of parents, teachers, and school programs, it is feasible to operationalize research on peer influence.

Issue: Substance use among high school and college students Recent research indicates that substance use among the younger population, particularly marijuana use among high school and college students has been increasing since 1990, after a decline in the 1980s. The possible new rising trend of drug abuse among adolescent and young adults is alerting policymakers and practitioners to come up with new solutions. Understanding the causes of drug use, thus, is critical for policymaking and program planning. NELS:88 provides standardized measures of major classes of substance use with lifetime, annual, and monthly incidence data. The data set may be helpful for explaining, rather than describing, the behavior of substance use. Because of the large time span of its longitudinal design and dense information about school, family, and peer groups, NELS:88 is good for tracing the drug use career (initiation, gatewaying, changing pattern of use, and cessation); evaluating the impact of family, community, and school experience on the behavior; and examining the long-term consequences of drug use."}, {"section_title": "E.", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Methodological Research", "text": "Methodological/technical matters are always intertwined with substantive issues.

It is not that the idea of school climate is unimportant; rather, it is that measuring school climate is a problem. The composite score is not useful because different people perceive the question differently. What is the difference really meant by respondents when they say \"disagree\" in contrast to \"agree\"? A study shows that school climate variance occurs mostly within school; i.e., different views are held by teachers within the same school, not across schools. It is important to have both accurate measurement and an appropriate analytic approach at the school and individual levels. In addition to school climate measures, NELS:88 also contains other indicator scales with multiple items, such as that of self-concept and opportunity to learn, which also need study. These scales can be examined with NELS:88 data. The results can be compared with that from other data sets that provide indicators for the same constructs (e.g., NAEP, SASS). NELS:88's weighting procedures include adjustment for unit nonresponse. Item nonresponse, however, has not been compensated (with some exceptions).

NELS:88 affords a laboratory to test the essence of sophistication of analytic techniques. Comparing results from analyses with different levels of sophistication but which cover the same data may help address the issues. For example, contrasting the results from LISREL with the SAS maximum likelihood estimate procedure (MLE) may be helpful for determining more efficient procedures in data analysis. Or, one can compare results from hierarchical regression on student data nested in schools with that from conventional multiple regression (with sampling bias correction procedures) to identify what kind of differences occur in the results. Factors (e.g., data measurement, scaling, range) that alter sensitivity of the outcomes to analytic techniques can be considered. Issue: Using sampling weights in multilevel analysis and structural equation modeling Questions arise as to how to apply sampling weights to complicated analysis with multilevel regression analysis. In addition, the problem of normality assumption with multistage sampling makes the LISREL model questionable. Estimates of variance with a multistage sampling design require sampling bias adjustment.

Efforts are needed to develop better ways to present HLM results (e.g., fixed effects and random effects at two or more levels) to make the results more informative.

If we have test scores for the same student at the different grade levels (e.g., grades 8-12), we can predict 12th grade scores based on the initial scores and a growth projectory within the time frame, and then identify the difference between the predicted 12th grade score and the actual 12th grade score. Though the predicted model may be a flat growth curve (which is not desirable), one can manipulate (\"switch\" on or off) certain variables either at school level (probably more policy-relevant) or individual level to see how the flat curve can be changed into a slope. Latent variables in the model are useful for such manipulation. The results can identify factors that are important in improving academic achievement growth. Such studies are underway [by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) and some doctoral dissertations work with the growth curve technique] and the results probably will be available soon. This approach is consistent with a generic way of looking at the data and policy issues: if a correlation is found, then researchers can go further to check at the experimental level to see how it works to improve outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Issue: Methods for intercohort analysis", "text": "Comparative analysis with longitudinal survey data collected from different cohorts across decades is highly valuable for policy studies. Major historical changes in education legislation and policies can be examined in connection to learning, behavior, and academic performance among NELS:88 Research Framework and Issues Summary of Research Issues students of different cohorts. The approach can be used for different comparisons. For example, at the student level, time-lag, fixed time, and longitudinal comparative analysis can be performed. The analysis involves technical difficulties such as combining data sets, handling different attrition rates, developing analytic strategies that appropriately compare statistics resulting from different surveys; establishing comparability of measurements used in different surveys, and interpreting subtle inconsistency of seemingly similar items across data sets. Methodological research and technical support is needed to develop sound strategies for intercohort analysis. NELS:88, HS&B, and NLS-72, with data that cover three decades of education changes in the U.S., offer abundant opportunities for exploring the issue. Further, one can compare statistical results from intercohort analysis to other information sources about historical changes in American education, including interpretive analysisas in contrast to statistical analysisof cross generation changes in broader literature of social sciences. ase-year ineligible students -The NELS:88 Base-year Survey excluded students who were in the sample but could not complete the questionnaire due to language or physical/mental disabilities. Among this group, those who became eligible at the time of the first followup were located and surveyed by the NELS:88 Base-year Ineligible Study. Ceiling effect -The result of a cognitive test having insufficient numbers of the more difficult items. In a longitudinal study, ceiling effects in the followup testings can cause change scores to be artificially constrained for high ability examinees. To reduce such bias, we can match test item difficulty to a person's ability level; this increases reliability at the extremes of the score distribution where it is most needed for studies of longitudinal change. The NELS:88 first and second followups used what was called \"proficiency level tests\" to minimize ceiling effects and floor effects (see also Floor effect). The multilevel tests are \"adaptive\" to the ability level of the students as they are assigned based on prior test performance. The results not only reduce the bias of the estimated score gains, but also allow more meaningful comparisons by linking score gains to learning and instruction. Centered score -A data transformation procedure used in hierarchical data analysis (e.g., with student-and school-level data); it typically involves subtracting the mean (either grand mean or school means) from the raw value of a student-level predictor variable. The procedure may make estimates more stable and intercepts more meaningful in interpretation. Cohort -A group of individuals who have a statistical characteristic in common, for example year of birth or grade in school or year of high school graduation. NELS:88 includes three overlapping but distinct nationally-representative grade cohorts: 1987-88 eighth graders, 1989-90 high school sophomores, and 1991-92 high school seniors. Composite -A derived variable that is created as a function of one or more variables for which data was directly collected (e.g., socioeconomic status is developed from five parent variables in NELS:88). Cross-sectional analysis -An analysis that focuses on events and statuses at a single point in time. For example, a cross-sectional analysis examines educational attainment of students at a particular, stage of schooling (e.g., eighth grade, tenth grade, or twelfth grade). NELS:88 is a longitudinal survey but with its sample freshening, three representative cross-sections are available for cross-sectional analysis (see also Freshening and Longitudinal analysis).
