However, only a portion of MCI patients progress to dementia while some individuals remain stable or even revert to the normal cognitive status [2] . Identifying predictors of conversion to AD is therefore critically important for AD prevention and targeted treatment.\nExisting research has implicated a number of biomarkers that predict conversion from MCI to AD or cognitive decline, including neuroimaging biomarkers [3] [4] [5] [6] , neuropsychological assessments [7] [8] [9] , and biomedical biomarkers [10, 11] . Most existing studies [12, 13] of predicting time-to-AD adopt Cox regression models with baseline measures. Such an approach implicitly assumes that the predictors stay constant over the length of study, which is unlikely to be true in studies over an extensive period of time. Moreover, the majority of such studies [14, 15] , exploiting longitudinal measures for predicting future biomarkers or clinical score of MCI patients, fail to take into account dependent terminal events, i.e., a biomarker's trajectory is directly informative about the time to event. In this scenario, separate modeling of the survival outcome and the longitudinal processes may overlook the underlying association and lead to biased inference.\nThe goal of this research is to identify the optimal outcome measures for enriching an MCI treatment study population with subjects who are most likely to progress over time. Current study designs have become reliant on biomarkers at baseline as a strategy for enriching with decliners, but it remains to be seen whether this strategy will be effective. Incorporation of longitudinal data for subject selection is plausible, and some adaptive design studies have begun to explore this strategy [16] [17] [18] . However, the comparative predictive value of longitudinal clinical and imaging data has not been previously reported. In this paper, instead of considering the conversion of MCI to AD as a binary response, we assessed the ability of various measures to predict time from study entry to AD conversion (first occurrence) for MCI patients using joint modeling of longitudinal and time-to-event data [19, 20] . The joint model analyzed these two types of outcomes simultaneously and was able to give more accurate parameter estimation and smaller standard errors which in turn yield greater statistical power. The specific measures chosen for comparison in this study covered the domains of clinical measures, neuropsychological assessments, neuroimaging, and functional and behavioral assessments. Relevant demographic and genetic variables (i.e., age, gender, education and APOE genotype) were employed as covariates given their potential effects on disease progression in AD [9] ."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study design and participants", "text": "Data used in this analysis were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (ADNI-1) study (http://adni.loni.ucla.edu), which investigates the progression of Alzheimer's disease using serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and various clinical and neurocognitive measures.

The analyzed data from previous studies [21] [22] [23] [24] were used.

The MRI data were acquired on 1.5T or 3T MRI scanners, and volumes of the region of interests (ROIs) were reconstructed with the Freesurfer [24] ."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analyses", "text": "The markers in this analysis were collected from participants at multiple time points during the follow-up period and were hypothesized to be related to AD progression-the event of interest. When the value of a marker at a time point is affected by the occurrence of an event at that time point, the longitudinal marker is an endogenous time-dependent covariate. However, the Cox model and its extensions cannot properly handle endogenous covariates [25] . We simultaneously modeled time-to-dementia as well as longitudinal change in the aforementioned neuro-psychological, neuro-imaging or functional/behavioral variables, using joint modelling for longitudinal and survival data. A joint model consisted of two submodels: the longitudinal sub-model and the survival sub-model. The longitudinal sub-model allowed us to describe the evolution of a repeated measure over time, while adjusting for age at baseline and presence of apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 allele. A random intercept and a random slope of time were also included in the sub-model to capture the between subject variation. We assumed linear trajectories for the markers, because the longitudinal measures under consideration did not display highly non-linearity in the trajectories before their AD conversion ( Figure 1 and 2). However, in a different setting where patients could have highly non-linear evolution, spline could be implemented in the longitudinal model to account for the nonlinear trajectories of measures. The survival time (in years) was defined as from the baseline visit date to AD conversion or censoring. Although certain participants were continued followed after the event of interest in the original study, we excluded the visits and measurements after AD conversion from this analysis. The survival sub-model took the form of a proportional hazards model with baseline covariates such as gender, age at baseline, presence of the APOE \u03b54 allele, years of education, and one of the longitudinal measures.\nAn association parameter (\u03b1) linked the two sub-models, assuming the hazard was dependent on the longitudinal measure through its current value. The parameter b 0i was the random intercept, b 1i was the random slope indicating subjectspecific change rate of the measure, and \u03b5 i (t ij ) was the measurement error. A significant \u03b1 indicated a strong association between the longitudinal measure and time to AD conversion. The joint model was reduced to separate models if \u03b1 = 0, and the advantage of joint model disappeared. The quantity exp(\u03b1) was the hazard ratio (HR; inverse hazard ratio HR \u22121 was used when the \u03b1 estimate was negative) for a one-unit increase in the trajectory m i (t), at time t. Specifically, a one-unit increase in trajectory increased the hazard by exp(\u03b1) times. To facilitate the comparison of the association parameter among markers, each maker was scaled to zero-mean and unit variance using the mean and standard deviation (SD) among all the participants and all the time points. For comparison, we also fitted a cross-sectional proportional hazards model (Cox model) that only incorporated the baseline measure in the prediction. The cross-sectional Cox model was represented as where h 0 (t) was the baseline hazard function and y i1 was the measure taken at the baseline visit. The parameter \u03b1 in the Cox model quantified the association between the baseline measurement and the event hazard. We refer the readers to [26] for an introductory overview on joint modeling and the comparison with Cox model. For consistency, we scaled each marker at baseline to zero-mean and unit variance.\nWe also assessed how well these measures could discriminate between MCI patients who progressed to AD and those who had a stable status. We calculated time-dependent areas under the ROC curves (AUCs) to assess the performance of the longitudinal marker at different time points over the follow-up period. We also computed the dynamic discrimination index (DDI) [27] , which summarized the discrimination power of the measure over the whole follow-up period for a \u0394t ahead prediction, using a weighted average of AUCs. In general, higher AUCs and DDI indicate higher discrimination of the models. We computed the probabilities of conversion to probable AD in the time frame (t, t +\u0394t], which meant using all measures of subject survived till time t to perform a \u0394t ahead prediction. We selected t at 12 th , 18 th , and 24 th month, and \u0394t as 6 and 12 months.\nTo avoid overestimation of the predictive performance of the markers [28] , we conducted a k-fold cross validation. The total sample of the MCI patients was randomly broken into k subgroups of approximately equal sizes. The analysis was repeated k times with one subset being left out as the test set and the others being used as the training set in each analysis. Parameter estimates of the joint model were derived from the training set and applied to the test set. Predictive accuracies were then computed by averaging the k separate analyses. We used k as 6 to have about 320 subjects in the training set and 64 subjects in the test set, which was considered necessary for power and allowed for a reasonable number of validations. All the analyses were performed using R (version 3\u00b72\u00b71). Cross-sectional Cox modeling and proportionality testing were conducted using the survival package. The Joint modeling and time-dependent AUCs calculation were achieved using the JM package [29] ."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The demographic characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1 . Participants were followed up for a mean of 3.2 years (SD 2.6; range 0.4-9.3 years) before conversion to AD or censoring. The average age at baseline was 74.7, 37.5% were women and a 15.6 years average education length. More than 54.2% of subjects had one or more APOE \u03b54 alleles.\nAmong the 384 MCI patients, 200 patients converted to AD over a mean follow-up period of 2.3 years. 184 patients had stable MCI, of which 77 had less than 3 years of follow-up while 107 were followed for at least 3 years. 23% subjects had only one follow-up visit. Table 2 shows the results of two models for each measure. We conducted the Z test of the null hypothesis in which the association parameter was zero (no association between maker and time to AD conversion). The HR was the primary effect size, and the markers were ranked based on the absolute Z value of the association parameter \u03b1 from the longitudinal prediction model. Figure 2 shows the trajectories and fitted spline curves for participants who progressed and those who did not progress to AD, for ADAS-Cog 13, ADAS-Cog 11, CDR-SB and FDG-PET, respectively. Only measurements before AD conversion or censoring are plotted on the figure. Participants who progressed to AD and those who did not progressed to AD during the study can be clearly distinguished by each of these measures. "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this paper, we used comprehensive longitudinal assessments to predict dementia in Alzheimer's disease in a manner that has not been accomplished by prior studies. By accounting for dependent terminal events, the joint models of longitudinal change and time to AD conversion identified several significant predictors. The strongest predictors are in the cognitive domain (ADAS-Cog, RAVLT), functional domain (FAQ), and neuroimaging domain (middle temporal gyrus and hippocampal volume). These findings are consistent with reports in the literature [3, 4, [6] [7] [8] [9] .\nOur study has also consolidated the findings in Fleisher, et al. [30] in the sense that common cognitive measures could provide more accurate prediction regarding AD conversion than volumetric MRI measures by evaluating the discriminative capability of the measures at different time points. In a large meta-analysis which did not include ADNI data, baseline cognitive measures were demonstrated as better predictors of AD conversion than brain volumetric markers [31] . Thus, with consideration of the comparative economy of cognitive measures, in expense and time, these measures should still be the gold standard for clinical assessment of conversion from MCI to AD. In addition, we note that different markers may show different predictive values at different times in disease progression. This has been reflected in the different changes of AUCs with the passage of time. The cognitive measures such as ADAS-Cog retain a moderate discriminative capability even in the later phrase of disease process while neuroimaging measures (volumetric MRI, PET) become less useful as time passes. This may explain why volumetric changes on MRI were reported to be better predictors than cognitive measures among cognitively normal individuals [32] . A similar point was also made in the literature [33, 34] . Our analyses controlled for the presence of APOE and demographic variables that have been associated with cognitive decline or the likelihood of developing AD. One caveat in our study is that some neuropsychological tests and clinical measures, such as CDR Sum of Boxes, may be used in the diagnostic process of AD. However, diagnoses are based, in various weight, on clinical history, laboratory data, and a full battery of tests which include some of the selected measures. It is also known that how far someone has progressed on a staging or cognitive measure predicts how fast they decline. So it is reasonable to explore selected measures as predictors in the joint models.\nThere are several limitations in our study. First, not all ADNI-1 participants underwent all measurements examinations, especially PET imaging and Everyday Cognition. The differences in sample sizes, particularly the smaller sample of FDG-PET and PIB-PET, may limit our ability to compare their predictive capabilities. However, this did not affect our conclusion on the other markers. Second, while each measure independently showed promise in predicting disease progression in our study, many recent researchers have shown interest in examining biomarker combinations as predictors for AD conversion [35] [36] [37] . The joint model adopted in present analysis can only handle a single longitudinal outcome, but can be extended to incorporate multivariate longitudinal measures as proposed in He, et al. [38] . The general idea is to introduce a continuous latent variable to represent patients' underlying disease severity. The observed longitudinal markers can be modeled as measurements of the latent variable using a multilevel item response theory sub-model and the time-to-event data are modeled using a Cox proportional hazard sub-model. Because all outcomes share the same latent variable, the dimensionality of the data can be reduced and fewer parameters are needed. Wang, et al. [39] proposed a prediction framework for multiple longitudinal measures and event time data based on the method. Simultaneous modeling of multiple longitudinal outcomes in joint models may substantially enhance the predictive ability of a joint model, and help to identifying the optimal combination of measures in determining the risk of incident AD dementia in MCI patients. Moreover, rather than using the diagnoses assigned by ADNI, which has been shown to produce a high rate of false positive diagnostic errors, the new approach for staging preclinical AD [40] would sharpen our model to identify early predictors. Last, the ADNI cohort is a convenience sample rather than an epidemiologic cohort, it is likely to result in recruiting more impaired subjects. However, this study focus on MCI population, may be less prone to selection bias than the larger ADNI study population. The cross-validation used in the analysis was an internal validation, and external validation with an independent data set could further consolidate our findings.\nIn summary, our study was the first attempt to comprehensively and systematically evaluate the predictive ability of markers for AD conversion under the joint model framework, which includes both baseline measures and changes in these measures over time. The sample from ADNI that we used was large, and the data were collected uniformly, rigorously and on a broad range of measures. We demonstrated that cognitive measures were consistently significant and generally stronger predictors than imaging measures, with ADAS-Cog 13 as the optimal predictor. Moreover, the measures identified as strong predictors in this study along with each joint model can be used for subject specific prediction. Such individualized risk prediction can help personalize screening strategies and/or guide the initiation of treatment among MCI patients or subject selection for clinical trials.
