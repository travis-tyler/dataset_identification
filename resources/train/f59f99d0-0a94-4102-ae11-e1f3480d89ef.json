Section 1 is on context/environment and includes four modules that address special education teacher quality (from the Study of Personnel Needs in Teacher Education (SPeNSE)); costs of special education (from the Special Education Expenditure Project); low income children with disabilities (from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study--kindergarten class of 1998-99); and use of the developmental delay classification for children ages 3 through 9. Section 2 provides information about student characteristics organized as follows: infants and toddlers; preschoolers; students ages 6 through 21; and individual and household characteristics of high school students with disabilities (from the National Longitudinal Transition Study 2). The four modules of Section 3 examine programs and services for students with disabilities and include quantity and quality of school-passed speechlanguage pathologists (based on data from SPeNSE); social adaptation and problem behaviors of elementary and middle school special education students (from the Special Education Elementary Longitudinal Study); educational environments (based on state-reported data on service settings), and state and local implementation and impact of IDEA (a view from the field). The final section's three modules report high school graduation rates among students with disabilities, data from the National Early Intervention Longitudinal Study on results experienced by children and families 1 year after beginning early intervention, and state improvement and monitoring. Extensive appendices provide data tables on child count, educational\n\nReproductions supplied by EDRS are the best that can be made from the original document.\n\n\fenvironments, personnel, program exiting, discipline, population and enrollment, state grant awards, and early intervention.

The first module presents information from the Study of Personnel Needs in Special Education (SPeNSE). The second provides information from the Special Education Expenditure Project (SEEP). The third module analyzes data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal StudyKindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K) to discuss children with disabilities in low-income families. Developmental delay is the focus of the fourth module.\nSpecial Education Teacher Quality\nSPeNSE was designed to describe the quality of personnel serving students with disabilities and the factors associated with workforce quality. SPeNSE data show that the nation's special education teachers, as a group, are highly experienced, averaging 14.3 years of teaching in 1999-2000; 12.3 of those years were spent teaching special education. SPeNSE data show that 59% of special education teachers had a master's degree, compared to 49% of regular education teachers. SPeNSE data tested five teacher-quality factors: experience, credentials, self-efficacy, professionalism, and selected classroom practices. Experience proved to be the strongest of the factors in this first analysis.\nWhat Are We Spending on SpecialEducation Services in the UnitedStates,\n1999-2000?\nThis module is based on descriptive information derived from SEEP. Data from SEEP indicate that the total spending to educate the average student with a disability amounts to $12,639. Total special education spending alone accounts for 13.9% of the $360.6 billion total spent on elementary and secondary education in the United States.\nxxi\n23\n\n\f24\" Annual Report to Congress\nIn constant dollars, total spending on special education (excluding Other Special Needs Program Services) has increased from an average of $9,858 per pupil in 1985-86 to $12,474 in 1999-2000, an annualized growth rate of 0.7%.\nDuring the 1999-2000 school year, over 80% of total special education expenditures were allocated to direct instruction and related services.\nChildren With Disabilities in Low-Income Families: AR Analysis of Data From the ECLS-If\nChild poverty has implications for the field of special education because it\ncan affect children's health and behavior, as well as their cognitive\ndevelopment and academic achievement.\nA third of mothers of poor children with individualized education\nprograms (IEPs) did not finish high school, compared with 7% of mothers of nonpoor children with IEPs. While single parenthood and lower parental educational attainment are by no means found exclusively among poor families, these demographic characteristics are strongly associated with poverty. Poverty alone had a negative effect on teacher ratings of approaches to learning.\nUse of the Developmental DelayClassification for Children Ages 3 Through\nThe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Amendments of 1997 expanded the age range to which develOpmental delay may apply to cover ages 3 through 9. By 2000-01, 20 states had expanded their age range above age 5, although not necessarily for the entire 6-through-9 age range. States report that using developmental delay through age 9 allows for continuity of services throughout the developmental years without a stigmatizing label that may be associated with a specific disability category. State-reported data suggest that there has been no surge in the number of children reported to be receiving services under IDEA and that use of the developmental delay option steadily decreases as chronological age\nincreases.\n2 4\n\n\fExecutive Summary\nSection II Student Characteristics\nThis section contains information about the characteristics of children and students receiving services under IDEA. The populations reported are children and families entering early intervention, preschoolers, and students ages 6 through 21. Data from the National Longitudinal Transition Study 2 (NLTS2) make up the final module.\nInfants and Toddlers Served Under IDEA\nAccording to the 2000 child count data, 63% of the children served under Part C were classified as White (non-Hispanic); 17% were Hispanic; 16% were Black (non-Hispanic); 4% were Asian/Pacific Islander; and 1% were American Indian/Alaska Native. During the 1999-2000 reporting period, states reported that 68% of all early intervention services took place in the home, compared with 63%\nserved in 1998-99 and 53% in 1995-96, before enactment of the IDEA\nAmendments of 1997. During this second year of collecting exit data, states continued to report eligibility for Part B as the most common reason for exit.\nPreschoolers Served Under IDEA\nFor the 2000-01 school year, states reported serving 599,678 children ages 3 through 5 with disabilities under IDEA, up from 589,134 in 1999-2000. Speech or language impairment was the most prevalent disability category, accounting for 55.2% of all preschoolers served in 2000-01.\nWhite (non-Hispanic) preschoolers were overrepresented in the Part B\npopulation. Asian/Pacific Islander and, especially, Hispanic children were underrepresented among the preschoolers served under IDEA.\nStudents Ages 6 Through 21 Served Under IDEA\nThe 5,775,722 students ages 6 through 21 served under Part B represented 8.8% of the U.S. resident population in 2000-01. Specific learning disabilities, speech or language impairments, mental\nretardation, and emotional disturbance continued to account for the\nmajority of students served under IDEA.\n2 5\n\n\f24t1 Annual Report to Congress\nWhite students made up 62.3% of the students served; 19.8% were Black; 14.5% were Hispanic; 1.9% were Asian/Pacific Islander; and 1.5% were American Indian/Alaska Native.\nIn 2000-01, the rank ordering of the top five disability categories was nearly identical for all racial/ethnic groups; however, students from some racial/ethnic groups were overrepresented or underrepresented in specific disability categories when compared with the IDEA student population as\na whole.\nA Chaugthg Population: Individual andHousehold Characteristics of High School Students With Disabilities\nThis study, which is modeled on NLTS, will follow secondary-school-age students through their mid-20s, collecting data on their secondary school experiences and achievements and how those influenced their postschool outcomes.\nThe population of high school students receiving special education in 2001\nmore closely mirrored the racial/ethnic distribution of the general\npopulation than had been true in 1987.\nHigh-school-age students with disabilities in 2001 were first identified as having a disability or delay significantly earlier than were their peers in\n1987.\nThe decline in the average age at first identification of a disability that was noted for students with disabilities as a whole resulted from statistically\nsignificant reductions in age for students in four disability categories learning disabilities, emotional disturbance, and orthopedic and other health impairmentsranging from almost 10 to 18 months.\nSection IIIPrograms and Services\nThe four modules in the section examine some of the programs and services available within schools for children and youth with disabilities and their families. The first module uses data from SPeNSE to discuss the quantity and quality of school-based speech-language pathologists. The module on social adaptation and problem behaviors of elementary and middle school students receiving special education reports data from the Special Education Elementary Longitudinal Study\n(SEELS). The next module, educational environments, contains state-reported data on the settings in which children and youth receive services. The last module in this\nxxiv\n2 6\n\n\fExecutive Summary\nsection describes SLIIDEA (State and Local Implementation and Impact of IDEA) and presents preliminary findings.\nEnsufing all Adequate Supply of High-Qualgy, School-Based SpeechLanguage Pathologists\nBecause so many students with disabilities require speech-language services, ensuring an adequate supply of high-quality speech-language\npathologists is crucial to the success of the students served under IDEA.\nHaving an adequate supply of school-based speech-language pathologists is as important as the quality of those available because shortages typically force administrators to hire less qualified individuals.\nSpeech-language pathologists devoted an average of 7.1 hours per week to completing paperwork, 4.6 hours per week to preparing services, 1.8 to sharing expertise with colleagues, 1.7 to reading background material, and 0.9 hours per week to communicating with parents.\nSchool-based speech-language pathologists rated their skills in a few areas as relatively low, suggesting a need for professional development in using technology in instruction, accommodating diverse students' needs, supervising paraprofessionals, using literature to address problems, and managing student behavior.\nSocial Adaptation and Problem Behaviors of Elementary and Middle School Students Receiving Special Education\nThe importance of behavior itself as an outcome, as well as its role as a mediating factor in many other important outcome domains, made it a priority area to address in OSEP's national assessment, including SEELS.\nSEELS data showed that students with learning, speech, hearing, vision, and orthopedic impairments received positive marks from parents and teachers in assertion, self-control, and cooperation.\nSocial development is a key outcome for many students with disabilities, and concerns about school safety and discipline generally have been increasing in recent years.\nAccording to parents, 14% of students with disabilities in elementary and middle school had been expelled or suspended at some point in their school careers.\n2?\n\n\f2e1Annual Report to Congress\nEducational Environments for Students With Disabilities\nIn 1999-2000, 95.9% of students with disabilities were served in regular school buildings; of those students, 47.3% were served outside of the regular classroom for less than 21% of the school day.\nStudents with low-incidence disabilities are less likely to spend the majority of their school day in the regular classroom, while the majority of students with learning disabilities and speech language impairments are served in the regular classroom.\nIt is possible that the differences in placement by race/ethnicity may reflect the disproportional representation of some minority groups in disability categories that are predominantly served in more restrictive\nsettings.\nStudy of State and Local Implementation and Impact of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act: A View From the Field of District Implementation\nSLIIDEA's charge is to understand both the implementation and impact of policy changes made in the IDEA Amendments of 1997 at the state, district, and school levels.\nThe SLIIDEA study is collecting data over a 5-year period by means of mail surveys at the state, district, and school levels and through focus studies of the implementation of IDEA in selected school districts.\nDistricts that showed evidence of use of a comprehensive range of\nimplementation tools, a consistent relationship between stated policies and activities, consistency across stakeholders on the knowledge base and skills required for implementation, and stakeholder satisfaction were more likely to have fewer students living in poverty, be smaller, and be suburban.\nSection IVResults\nThis section of the annual report contains three modules. The modules describe high school graduation among students with disabilities, data from the National Early Intervention Longitudinal Study on the results experienced by children and families 1 year after beginning early intervention, and state improvement and monitoring activities.\n\n\fExecutive Summary\nHi0 School Graduation Among Students With Disabilities\nIn 1999-2000, the standard diploma graduation rate for students with\ndisabilities age 14 and older was 56.2%. The graduation rate was highest, and the dropout rate lowest, for White and Asian/Pacific Islander students.\nImprovements in the dropout rate took place in almost every disability category, most notably among students with speech/language impairments, specific learning disabilities, orthopedic impairments, hearing impairments, and emotional disturbance.\nResults Experienced by Children and Families 1 YearAfter Beginning Early Intervention\nChildren in all age groups are advancing developmentally, with significantly higher percentages of children in each group showing mastery of selected milestones 1 year after entering early intervention. Notably, for all four age groups, after 1 year, significantly more families felt confident about their ability to help their child learn and develop. Families report that their child's communication and motor skills have improved, and over two thirds of families report that early intervention has had a lot of impact on the child's development.\nFamilies of nearly all children in early intervention reported that their children had a place to go for regular medical care; there has been no change in this variable since the first year in early intervention.\nState Improvement and Monitoring\nOSEP has redesigned its accountability system into a Continuous Improvement Monitoring Process (CIMP) that incorporates strategies\ndesigned to foster greater state accountability, increase parental\ninvolvement, establish a data-driven process to inform improvement\nplanning, and ensure public awareness and dissemination.\nOSEP is assisting states in completing self-assessments, designing and implementing effective improvement plans, and obtaining data to support\nprogram accountability.\nxxvii\n29\n\n\f24th Annual Report to Congress\nOSEP is working with states to develop procedures leading to effective transition, including the development of shared data systems to track children as they move through transition activities.\no Implementation of the CIMP has increased accountability of states, ensured public involvement and input, focused on processes with the\nstrongest relationship to positive results, created mechanisms for making data-driven decisions, and increased emphasis on improving results for children with disabilities and their families.\n\nxxviii\n\n30\n\n\fI. CONTEXT/ENVIRONMENT\nSpecial Education Teacher Quality What Are We Spending on Special Education Services in the\nUnited States, 1999-2000? Children With Disabilities in Low-Income Families: An Analysis\nof Data From the ECLS-K Use of the Developmental Delay Classification for Children\nAges 3 Through 9\n3 1\n\n\fSpecial Education Teacher Quality\nRecent Federal legislation has been peppered with references to teacher quality and its importance in improving educational outcomes. The No Child Left Behind Act, which President Bush signed into law in January 2002, includes grants to assist public agencies in enhancing students' academic achievement by increasing teacher quality and the number of highly qualified teachers. In amending the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) in 1997, Congress reasserted its support for professional development activities to give teachers the knowledge and skills they need to help students meet challenging educational goals and lead productive, independent adult lives 5601(c)(5)).\nOver the past 20 years, a consensus has gradually emerged that teacher quality is best measured by student achievement, and previous research shows that the quality of children's teachers significantly influences their achievement. In a Tennessee-based study, Sanders and Rivers (1996) found that, on average, the least effective teachers in one district produced annual gains of roughly 14 percentile points among lowachieving students, while the most effective teachers produced gains of 53 percentile points. Furthermore, they reported that the effects of teachers were long term: 2\nyears after having a particularly weak or strong third-grade teacher, student\nachievement was still affected. The researchers concluded that students with similar initial achievement levels have \"vastly different academic outcomes as a result of the sequence of teachers to which they are assigned\" (p. 6). Similar results have been documented in Dallas and Boston (Bain et al., as cited in Haycock, 1998; Jordan, Mendro, & Weerasinghe, 1997).\nHowever, these studies leave many questions unanswered. They do not indicate what teacher practices, attitudes, or attributes account for differences in student outcomes. In addition, the studies have been conducted in regular education rather than special education. High-quality special educators may possess knowledge and skills not required of high-quality general educators. Moreover, because special education teachers often serve a supporting rather than a primary role in delivering instruction,\ntheir influence on student achievement may be indirect or intermingled with that of\nregular education teachers.\nStudy Methods\nThe Study of Personnel Needs in Special Education (SPeNSE), conducted by Westat under contract with the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP), was designed to describe the quality of personnel serving students\nI-1\n32\n\n\f24' Annual Report to Congress\n\nwith disabilities and the factors associated with workforce quality.' It included\ntelephone interviews with a nationally representative sample of 358 local\nadministrators and 8,061 service providers, including special and regular education teachers, speech-language pathologists, and special education paraprofessionals.2 This module summarizes results from SPeNSE on special education teacher quality.\nBefore we can answer questions about the quality of the nation's special education teachers, we must first explore further what we mean by a high-quality teacher. Teacher quality is a highly complex construct. As such, it cannot be defined or measured through one or two variables. Rather, many different beliefs, attributes, and experiences, and the behaviors that result from those beliefs, attributes, and experiences, interact as indicators of teacher quality.\nSPeNSE researchers used factor analysis to explore the extent to which the data reported by special education teachers supported previous theoretical and empirical work on teacher quality and to derive a teacher-quality measure. Factor analysis manipulates a large set of variables and groups them into a smaller number of factors that contain most of the information inherent in the original variables, making the data easier to analyze and interpret. In this analysis, LISREL was used to conduct a\nconfirmatory factor analysis, meaning the factors were determined a priori.\nLimitations of SPeNSE for Measuring Teacher Quality\nIt is important to note from the outset that there were several limitations for\nmeasuring teacher quality using the SPeNSE data. First, in regular education, strong verbal and math skills have been associated with student achievement. For example, in studies in Texas and Alabama (Ferguson, 1991; Ferguson & Ladd, 1996), higher scoring teachers were more likely than their lower scoring colleagues to produce significant gains in student performance, when teachers were assessed on a basic literacy test or the American College Test (ACT). While SPeNSE interviews included a few items on teachers' test participation and performance, specifically with regard to tests for certification or licensure, an insufficient number of special education teachers took those tests to include the items in the factor analysis. Furthermore, the missing data were not random. Because tests for certification have become more prevalent in recent years, teachers who took them had significantly fewer years of teaching experience than those who did not. This precluded entering teachers' years of experience and test performance in the same model. Consequently, we cannot speak to verbal ability specifically, or tested ability more generally, as a component of teacher quality.\n\nI For more information on the SPeNSE study design and results, go to www.spense.org. 2 SPeNSE data were weighted to generate national estimates.\n\n1-2\n\n33\n\n\fSpecial Education Teacher Quality\nSecond, if growth in student achievement is the ultimate measure of teacher quality, the validity of the SPeNSE model can only be tested through a confirmatory analysis using a data set that contains relevant information on special education teachers and the achievement of the students they serve. The SPeNSE data set does not include student achievement data. As such, this analysis and its results should be considered exploratory. Despite its limitations, it may further the dialogue on ways to identify, prepare, and retain high-quality teachers. It represents a first step in the exploration of special education teacher quality. At the end of this module, plans for further research are described.\nCorrelates of Teacher Quality\nUsing the SPeNSE data on special education teachers, five teacher-quality factors were tested. They were:\nexperience, credentials, self-efficacy, professionalism, and\nselected classroom practices.\nTable I-1 includes a brief description of the variables included in each of the teacher-\nquality factors. At the end of this module, a table lists factor loadings for each\nvariable and the amount of variance explained by the factor.\nThis next section presents descriptive information on the variables that were important in the factor analysis on special education teacher quality. This information provides a context for understanding the results of the factor analysis\nand the resulting factor scores. Where appropriate, we summarize previous research related to the relationship between the factor in question and student achievement.\nFactor I: Experience\nOver the past 20 years, research has shown a consistent, positive relationship between teachers' experience and student achievement (Biniaminov & Glasman,\n1983; Lopez, 1995; Murnane, 1981) at the individual, classroom, school, and district\n1-3\n\n\f241! Annual Report to Congress\nTable I-1 Variables Included in the Five Teacher-Quality Factors\nFactor 1: Experience. This factor included two variablesyears teaching and years teaching special education. The factor loadings for the two experience variables are close to 1, which is very high. This means that the factor explains most of the variance.\nFactor 2: Credentials. This factor included three variables: level of certification (none, emergency, certified out of field, fully certified for position); number of fields in which teachers were certified; and highest degree earned. In defining the credential factor, level of certification was most important. The variable that measured the number of fields in which teachers were certified was least important, with its variance largely unexplained.\nFactor 3: Self-efficacy. This factor included three variables. The first was a scale on special education teachers' perceptions of their skill in completing a variety of tasks related to their work, such as using appropriate instructional techniques, managing behavior, monitoring student progress and adjusting instruction accordingly, and working with parents. The second was teachers' assessment of their overall performance as a teacher. The third summarized several items designed to measure teacher beliefs (e.g., Ifyou try hard you can set through to even the most difficult student). The factor loadings for all three self-efficacy variables were reasonably high.\nFactor 4: Professionalism. This factor included three variables: the number of professional journals teachers read regularly, the number of professional associations to which they belonged, and the number of times per month that colleagues asked them for professional advice. The three variables have moderate and more or less equal factor loadings; their variances are largely unexplained.\nFactor 5: Selected classroom practices. This factor included four variables. Three of them were scale scores for the frequency with which special education teachers reported using specified best practices in teaching reading, managing behavior, and promoting inclusion. The fourth was a variable on the extent to which teachers individualized reading instruction. The reading scale and the inclusion scale have reasonable factor loadings. The other variables, although significant, have small factor loadings.\nSource: Study of Personnel Needs in Special Education.\nlevels (Ferguson, 1991; Murnane, 1981; Turner & Camilli, 1988; Wendling & Cohen,\n1980). Ferguson (1991) found that students in districts with more experienced teachers performed better after controlling for many other factors. The percentage of a district's teachers with 5 to 9 or 9 or more years of experience explained more than 10% of the between-district variance in student test scores. For elementary school teachers, experience beyond 5 years did not contribute to enhanced\nachievement, but it did for high school teachers.\nBased on studies of classes and schools in two U.S. cities, Murnane (1981) reported that teachers with 3 to 5 years of experience were more effective than those with fewer than 3 years of experience. He found that classes with teachers who had 3 to 5 years of teaching experience averaged 2 to 3 months more reading progress in\nsecond grade than did classes with first-year teachers. Differences in math\nachievement were even greater.\n\n1-4\n\n35;\n\nBEST COPY AVAILABLE\n\n\fSpecial Education Teacher Quality\nSPeNSE data show that the nation's special education teachers, as a group, are highly experienced, averaging 14.3 years of teaching in 1999-2000; 12.3 of those years were spent teaching special education. This compares with SPeNSE estimates of 15.5 years of teaching experience for the nation's regular education teachers.\nFactor 2: Credentials\nThe two components of the teacher credential factor were certification and teachers' level of education. There has been considerable debate in the literature about the importance of certification as a component or measure of teacher quality (Abell Foundation, 2001; Ballou & Podgursky, 1998; Darling-Hammond, 2000; Goldhaber\n& Brewer, 2000). Results of research on the relationship between student\nachievement and teacher certification have been ambiguous. Lopez (1995) found that teacher certification did not affect student achievement. However, Goldhaber and Brewer (2000) found that having a teacher who had standard certification had a statistically significant positive effect on 12th-grade test scores in math compared to teachers with private school certification or no certification in mathematics. They\nalso reported that students assigned to mathematics and science teachers with emergency certification did no worse than students assigned to teachers with standard certification after controlling for many other factors. Darling-Hammond (2000) found that the proportion of a state's teachers with full state certification and a major in their teaching field was a significant predictor of student achievement at\nthe state level.\nSPeNSE data indicate that nationwide, 92% of special education teachers were fully certified for their main teaching assignment. Of those who were not fully certified, 1.5% did not have any teaching certificate or license, 4.8% had only an emergency\ncertificate, and 2.0% were fully certified in a position other than their main\nassignment or in another state. Certification issues were most prevalent among less experienced teachers and teachers of students with emotional disturbance (ED). Only 71% of teachers with fewer than 3 years of experience were fully certified for their positions, compared to 94% of those with 3 or more years' experience. Eightyfour percent of all ED teachers were fully certified for their positions.\nResults of previous studies have been ambiguous about a relationship between teacher level of education and student achievement (Darling-Hammond, 2000; Ferguson, 1991; Goldhaber & Brewer, 1997; Hedges, Laine, & Greenwald, 1994; Wenglinsky, 2000). Darling-Hammond (2000) reported that the percentage of a state's teachers with a master's degree was a weak but significant predictor of student achievement. In SPeNSE, teacher's level of education was significantly and moderately associated with the credentials factor. SPeNSE data show that 59% of\n1-5\n3.6\n\n\f24111 Annual Report to Congress\nspecial education teachers had a master's degree, compared to 49% of regular\neducation teachers.\nFactor 3: Self-Efficacy\nTeacher self-efficacy' has repeatedly predicted student achievement and other important student outcomes despite inconsistencies in the instruments used to measure self-efficacy and the tests used to measure student achievement (Ashton & Webb, 1986; Midgley, Feldlaufer, & Eccles, 1989; Moore & Esselman, 1992; Ross,\n1992. Gibson and Dembo (1984) found that teachers with high self-efficacy behaved differently from their colleagues. They more often persisted with struggling students and less often criticized students who answered incorrectly. Bender and Ukeje (1989)\nfound that teachers with high self-efficacy were more likely to use effective\ninstructional practices, and Landrum and Kaufman (1992) found that colleagues of regular education teachers with high self-efficacy perceived these teachers to be more capable of teaching students with behavior disorders.\nOverall, special education teachers reported high levels of self-efficacy in SPeNSE. They agreed to a moderate/great extent that they had the preparation and experience to deal with most of their students' learning problems, that they dealt successfully with their students' behavior problems, and that they made a significant difference in their students' lives. They were slightly less likely to agree that if they tried hard, they could get through to even the most difficult or unmotivated students, or if their students mastered a new concept quickly, it was probably because they knew how to teach it. In rating their overall job performance, 62% said veg good, and 20% said\nexceptional.\nSpecial education teachers reported being highly skilled in many specific tasks\nrequired in their work, including planning effective lessons, managing behavior, using appropriate instructional techniques, and working with parents. They considered themselves relatively less skilled in using technology in instruction and accommodating culturally and linguistically diverse students' instructional needs.\nFactor 4: Professionalism\nReading professional journals and belonging to professional associations may help teachers stay abreast of developments in the field and promote a sense of community among educators. However, rather than being a direct measure of teacher quality,\n3 Brownell and Pajares (1999) defmed teacher efficacy as \"situation-specific 'perceptions of their own teaching abilities'. . .contextual judgments of their capability to succeed in particular instructional endeavors\" (p. 154).\nI-6\n3 7\n\n\fSpecial Education Teacher Quality\nprofessionalism is likely a proxy for attitudinal differences among educators, such as professional identity, commitment to teaching, or an orientation toward life-long learning.\nProfessionalism from the SPeNSE factor analysis is loosely aligned with the concept\nof the professional teacher described by Murnane and Raizen (1988). Their professional teacher is knowledgeable about the subject matter, is intellectually\ncurious, can modify curricula to best benefit students, and is a life-long learner. The\nauthors also mention involvement in professional associations and work on publications as activities appropriate for the professional teacher (Murnane &\nRaizen, 1988).\nSPeNSE found that the typical special education teacher reads one professional journal on a regular basis and belongs to one professional association. While professional activities emerged as a strong factor in SPeNSE, no research has been identified to support or refute the theory that students of teachers who read professional journals and belong to professional associations have better rates of\nacademic achievement.\nFactor 5: Selected Classroom Practices\nClassroom practices are basic to teacher quality because interactions between teachers and their students directly affect the outcome of interestimproved student achievement. Process-product research has shown that specific teaching practices are related to student achievement (Pressley, Wharton-McDonald, Allington, Block, & Morrow, 1998; Wenglinsky, 2000). However, specific practices may also have their limits as indicators of teacher quality because good teaching requires using a variety of strategies, depending on the instructional context (Murnane & Raizen, 1988). This may be especially true in special education, where\nflexibility and individualization of instruction are especially important.\nSPeNSE did not measure classroom practices through direct observation. Rather, it relied on self-reports of the use of various classroom practices. SPeNSE gave particular attention to five instructional areas: teaching reading, managing behavior, facilitating secondary transition, teaching English language learners (ELLs), and promoting inclusion.4 Two of the instructional areas, teaching ELLs and facilitating\n4 In each of these professional areas, service providers were asked the extent to which they used various best practices identified by experts in the field. For example, 12 instructional practices were listed for teaching reading, and respondents were asked, for each of the 12, whether they use that approach not at all, to a small extent, to a moderate extent, or to a great extent. Scale scores were created by combining responses to those items that were highly correlated.\n1-7\n\n\f24th Annual Report to Congress\nsecondary transition, were excluded from this factor analysis because the items were inappropriate for many of the respondents due to the types of students they taught.\nTeachers' responses on the frequency with which they used various classroom practices were combined into scales for teaching reading, managing behavior, and promoting inclusion. On average, special education teachers reported using all three categories of classroom practices (i.e., teaching reading, managing behavior, and\npromoting inclusion) to a moderate extent.\nMost of the individual items included in the SPeNSE classroom practice scales have documented links to student achievement. For example, the reading scale included questions about how often teachers asked their students to practice phonics or phonemic skills, systematically learn vocabulary, study the style or structure of a text, summarize what they had read, and read aloud. Previous research consistently links these practices with improvements in reading achievement (Pressley et al., 1998; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2000).\nPositive behavioral supports, which use \". . . long-term strategies to reduce inappropriate behavior, teach more appropriate behavior, and provide contextual support necessary for successful outcomes\" (Warger, 1999, p. 1), have been\nassociated with reductions in problem behaviors, increases in instructional time, and enhanced academic achievement (Pressley et al., 1998; Sugai & Homer, 2001). Many of the items included in the best practice scale for managing behavior are associated with research on positive behavioral supports, including teaching social skills, using tangible and social acknowledgements for appropriate behavior, giving in-class timeouts, and conducting functional behavioral assessments.\nThe goals of including students with disabilities in ciSses with their nondisabled peers are often social and functional as well as academic. Studies have linked the use of co-teaching models, in which special and general educators teach classes together, with enhanced social skills and academic achievement for low-achieving students (Pugach & Wesson, 1995; Walther-Thomas, 1997). However, most of the literature on inclusion does not attempt to associate student outcomes with specific teaching practices used in inclusive schools and classrooms. Consequently, the connection between student achievement and the items in the SPeNSE best practice scale on inclusion is tenuous.\nAn Aggregate Teacher-Quality Measure\nIn an attempt to derive a single measure of teacher quality, SPeNSE researchers conducted a second-order factor analysis in which the first-order factors (experience, credentials, self-efficacy, professionalism, and selected classroom practices) were combined to generate a single teacher-quality factor. In the aggregate teacher-quality\n1-8\n39\n\n\fSpecial Education Teacher Quality\nmeasure, professionalism was the most important factor, followed by self-efficacy. The other three were almost equal, with moderate factor loadings. The results suggest that each of the five teacher-quality factors is an important component of an aggregate teacher-quality measure and should be considered in future research on teacher quality.\nSPeNSE analyses suggest that complex measures are required for assessing whether teachers are of high quality or for comparing workforce quality across schools, districts, or states. SPeNSE also suggests that teacher attitudes, such as self-efficacy or an orientation toward life-long learning, may be important areas of research in teacher quality. In particular, the professionalism factor requires further exploration\nto determine its component parts and their relationship to teacher quality and\nstudent achievement. It may be equally important to learn whether teacher attitudes linked to student achievement are relatively stable aspects of a teacher's personality or whether they can be taught during preservice preparation and, if so, how that is best accomplished.\nNext Steps: Testing the Model Using Student Achievement Data\nOSEP has a unique opportunity to test the validity of the teacher-quality model described in this module. The Special Education Elementary Longitudinal Study (SEELS), which is being conducted by SRI International under contract with the U.S. Department of Education, will provide nationally representative data on students with disabilities, including their academic achievement and the characteristics of their language arts teachers. Through a coordinated set of analyses using data from SPeNSE and SEELS, researchers will study the influence of teacher characteristics on the academic athievement of students with disabilities.\nResearchers will develop multivariate models that explore the relationship between teacher characteristics, such as years of experience, certification status, level of education, self-efficacy, and practices for teaching reading,' and student achievement, while controlling for other known correlates of student achievement (e.g., parents' education, family income, and school size). Several different models will be developed. Some will include individual teacher characteristics, like those specified; others will include an aggregate teacher-quality measure that combines these various teacher characteristics into a single variable.\nIt is likely that the quality of the special education teachers in a given school or district may be affected by many variables. These variables may include preservice\n5 SEELS did not include questions on facilitating inclusion, managing behavior, or professional\nactivities.\n1-9\n40\n\n\f24th Annual Report to Congress\npreparation that provides future teachers with the knowledge and skills needed in the classroom, personnel policies that help administrators recruit and retain high-quality staff, continuing professional development that hones teachers' skills, and working conditions that facilitate the teaching and learning process. These influences may also affect the quality of the workforce nationwide through the career choices people make. For example, if salaries in teaching are not competitive with those in other professions, talented young adults may chose alternative careers, and experienced teachers may leave teaching for higher paying positions in other fields.\nLocal, state, and Federal policymakers and administrators of teacher preparation programs must make difficult choices about how to allocate their financial and personnel resources to greatest effect. It is important for them to know what changes in policy and practice are most effective for improving teacher quality in special education. If the SPeNSE teacher-quality model is confirmed in SEELS, researchers will try to address these issues by exploring conditions and experiences associated with high-quality teachers. Such research would yield information on issues such as the role of professional development in enhancing teacher quality, the influence of salary and other forms of compensation on teacher quality, and the relationship between preservice program characteristics and teacher quality.\nSummary\nThe initial SPeNSE factor analysis tested experience, credentials, self-efficacy,\nprofessionalism, and selected classroom practices. Experience proved to be the strongest of the factors in this first analysis, with the highest factor loadings.\nResearchers then conducted a second-order factor analysis in an attempt to derive a single, aggregate measure of teacher quality. The second analysis indicated that professionalism, as defined by a finite set of professional activities, was the most important factor in the aggregate measure, followed by self-efficacy. The three remaining factors had moderate and nearly equal factor loadings. The results of the second analysis suggest that all five of the teacher-quality factors are important components of the aggregate teacher-quality measure.\nAttempts to use SPeNSE data to measure teacher quality have several limitations. However, these exploratory analyses are an important first step in measuring special education teacher quality. Future analyses of SPeNSE data in conjunction with SEELS data will test the validity of the SPeNSE teacher-quality model and shed new light on how teacher characteristics influence the academic achievement of students with disabilities.\n\n1-10\n\n41\n\n\fSpecial Education Teacher Quality,\nAppendix\nFactor Loadings and Model Fit Statistics\nThe factor loadings range from 1 to 1. The size indicates the relative importance of each variable among those variables that define the factor. The factor loadings are the correlations between the variables and the factor. Their squares tell how much variance is explained by the factor. For example, if a factor loading of a variable is 0.5, then 25% of its variance is explained by the factor.\n\n\f24' Annual Report to Congress\n\nFactor Loadings of the First-Order Factorsw\n\nVariable SYEARTCH SYEARSSE D2CERT\nDHIGHED DCNTCERT\nSEFF11/\nDOVERALL DSKILLSE\nSJOURNALS SASSOCIA DRADVICE\nDREADSP\nDINDIV\nDMANAGS2\nDIN CLUS2\nDREMAIN SFARRELO SKNOWCUL\n\nVariable description Years teaching\nYears teaching in special education Level of certification\nHighest degree earned Number of fields in which certified\nScore on the Gibson & Dembo self-efficacy scale\nGeneral self-assessment of performance as a teacher Scale combining self-assessment on specific professional skills, a subset of those in the CEC Standards for Entry into Practice\n# professional journals teachers read regularly\n# professional associations to which teachers belong Times per month teachers are asked for professional advice from colleagues\nFrequency with which teachers reported using identified best practices to teach reading Extent to which teachers individualized reading instruction\nFrequency with which teachers reported using identified best practices to manage behavior\nFrequency with which teachers reported using identified best practices to promote inclusion Plans to remain in teaching special education\nDistance teacher relocated to accept current position\nExtent to which teachers know the cultures of the students in their school\n\nExper .986 .908\n\nFactor loadings\nCred Self-e f Prof\n.560 .367 .181\n.510 .682 .768\n.301 .333 .331\n\nPedag\n.504 .163 .295 .523\n\nError variance\n0.03 0.18 0.69 0.88 0.97 0.73 0.53 0.40\n0.90 0.89 0.89\n0.75\n0.90\n0.92\n0.72\n\na/\n\nAll variables with significant factor loadings in LISREL were retained.\n\nb/\n\nThis variable was itself derived through a factor analysis of individual items in the Gibson &\n\nDembo self-efficacy scale.\n\nSource: Study of Personnel Needs in Special Education.\n\n1-12\n\n43\n\nBEST COPY AVAILABLE\n\n\fSpecial Education Teacher Quality\n\nFactor Loadings of the Second-Order Factor\n\nFactor: Teacher Quality\nVariable\nEXPERIENCE CREDENTIALS SELF-EFFICACY PROFESSIONALISM SELECTED CLASSROOM PRACTICES\n\nFactor Loading 0.400 0.414 0.874 0.924\n0.441\n\nSource: Study of Personnel Needs in Special Education.\n\nError Variance 0.84 0.83 0.24 0.15\n0.81\n\nModel Fit Statistics\n\nThe following model fit statistics show that the model fit was adequate.

SEEP is the fourth project sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education to examine the nation's spending on special education and related services (Kakalik, Furry, Thomas, & Carney, 1981; Moore,\nStrang, Schwartz, & Braddock, 1988; Rossmiller, Hale, & Frohreich, 1970).\nThis module provides basic summary information on the following issues for the\n1999-2000 school year:\nWhat are we spending on special education services for students with\ndisabilities in the United States?\nHow do special and regular education expenditures compare?\nHow has special education spending changed over time?\nWhat are the components of special education spending?\nWhat are we spending on transportation services for students with\ndisabilities?\nWhat are we spending on identification and due process for students with\ndisabilities?\nA Conceptual Framework for Analyzing Special Education Spending\nBefore presenting the numbers, it is important to distinguish between total ipecial\neducation ipending and total .0ending to educate a student with a disabilio. Total .pecial education\nipending includes amounts used to employ special education teachers, related service providers, and special education administrators, as well as spending on special\nA longer article with greater detail can be found at: www.seep.org/results.html.

Some portion of special education spending is used for instructional services that normally would be provided as part of the general education curriculum offered to regular education students.\nIn contrast to total special education spending, total spending to educate a student with a\ndisabilio encompasses all school resources, including both special and regular education and other special needs programs, used to provide a comprehensive educational program to meet student needs. Most students with disabilities spend substantial amounts of time in the regular education program and benefit from the\nsame administrative and support services as all other students.\nThe additional expenditure attributable to special education students is measured by the difference between the total spending to educate a student with a disability and the total spending to educate a regular education student (i.e., a student with no\ndisabilities or other special needs). This concept of additional expenditure\nemphasizes that what is being measured is a reflection of actual spending patterns on special and regular education students and not a reflection of some ideal concept of what it should cost to educate either student. The numbers presented in this report represent \"what is\" rather than necessarily \"what ought to be.\"\nThis report uses the term expenditure instead of cost to emphasize the fact that all\nthat is being measured is the flow of dollars. The word cost, in contrast to\nexpenditure, implies that one knows something about results. To say it cost twice as much to educate a special versus a regular education student implies that one is holding constant what is meant by the term \"educate.\" All of the studies (including the present study) are focused on expenditures with no implications about the\nresults. The expenditure figures presented represent an estimate of the current\nbehavior of the schools and districts across the nation and imply nothing about what spending is required to provide similar results for students with disabilities.\nTotal Spending on Students With Disabilities\nDuring the 1999-2000 school year, the United States spent about $50 billion on special education services. Another $27.3 billion was expended on regular education services, and an additional $1 billion was spent on other special needs programs (e.g., Title I, English language learners, or Gifted and Talented Education) for students with disabilities eligible for special education. Thus, total spending to educate all students with disabilities found eligible for special education programs amounted to\n$78.3 billion (see Figure I-1).\n1-20\n5 0\n\n\fWhat Are We Spending on Special Education Services in the United States, 1999-2000?\nFigure I-1 Total Spending on Students With Disabilities Who Are Eligible for Special\nEducation Services in the United States, 1999-2000\n\nSpecial Education Spending on\nSpecial Education Students $50.0 billion\nSource: Special Education Expenditure Project.\n\nRegular Education Spending $27.3 billion\nSpending on Other Special\nPrograms $1.0 billion\n\nIn per-pupil terms, the total spending used to educate the average student with a disability amounts to $12,639 (see Figure 1-2). This amount includes $8,080 per pupil on special education services, $4,394 per pupil on regular education services, and $165 per pupil on services from other special need programs (e.g., Title I, English language learners, or Gifted and Talented Education). The total including only the regular and special education services amounts to $12,474 per pupil.\nBased on these figures, the total spending to educate students with disabilities, including regular education, special education, and other special needs programs combined, represents 21.4% of the $360.6 billion total spending on elementary and secondary education in the United States. Total special education spending alone\naccounts for 13.9% of total spending.\n\n1-21\n\nBEST COPY AVAILABLE\n\n51\n\n\f240 Annual Report to Congress\nFigure 1-2 Calculation of Additional Expenditure on a Student With a Disability,\n1999-2000\n\n$14,000\n\nTotal: $12,639\n\nTotal: $12,639\n\n$12,000 $10,000\n\nOther 7\nspecial programs\n$165\n\n$8,000 $6,000 -\n\nSpecial education expenditure\n$8,080\n\n$4,000 $2,000\n\nRegular education expenditure\n$4,394\n\nAdditional expenditure attributable to other special programs\n$165\n\nAdditional expenditure attributable\nto special education\n$5,918\nExpenditure to educate a\nregular education student with no special\nneeds\n\n$6,556\n\n$0\n\nComponents of total expenditure to educate a student with a disability\n\nDifference between expenditure to educate a regular education student\nand a student with a disability\n\nSource: Special Education Expenditure Project.\nAdditional Expenditure To Educate a Student With a DisabiliOr\nHow much more is being expended to educate a student with a disability than a student with no special programmatic needs? In other words, what is the additional spending on a student with a disability? Addressing this question permits a comparison of the special education student to a consistent benchmarkthe regular education student who requires no services from any special program (e.g., for students with disabilities, students from economically disadvantaged homes, or students who are\nEnglish language learners).\n\nEST C*t\" Y AVAILABLE\n1-22\n52\n\n\fWhat Are We Spending on Special Education Services in the United States, 1999-2000?\nThe data derived from SEEP indicate that the base expenditure on a regular\neducation student amounts to $6,556 per pupil. Comparing this figure to the average expenditure for a student eligible to receive special education services, the additional expenditure amounts to $5,918 per pupil attributable to special education.\nAlternatively, one can use these figures to estimate the ratio of expenditure to educate a special versus regular education student. The ratio of additional expenditures attributable exclusively to special education may be estimated as 1.90\n($12,639-$165)/$6,556). This suggests that, on average, the nation spends 90% more on a special education student than on a regular education student.\nIn most states, school funding formulas are designed to provide revenues necessary\nto support current operating expenditures for schools and school districts.2 Expenditures on capital facilities such as school and central office buildings are funded separately from the standard school funding formulas. The expenditure\nfigures reported above include both current operating expenditures and estimates of capital expenditures for serving special and regular education students. If one excludes expenditures on capital facilities from the figures above, the ratio of current operating expenditure to educate a special education student relative to a regular education student is 2.08 (or 2.11 if other special programs are included)? In other\nwords, the additional current operating expenditure to educate a special\neducation student is 108% of the current operating expenditure to educate a regular education student with no special needs. The reason this ratio increases from 1.90 to 2.08 is that the additional time and personnel required to meet the needs of special versus regular education students exceeds the additional amount of classroom space necessary to serve these needs in relative terms.4\n\n2 Current operating expenditures include salaries, employee benefits, purchased services, supplies, tuition, and other annual expenditures for operations. Examples of items not included are capital outlays, debt service, facilities acquisition and construction, and property expenditures.\n3 This ratio is calculated by dividing total current expenditures used to educate students with\ndisabilities (excluding facilities, $11,096) by total current expenditure for a regular education student with no special needs (excluding facilities, $5,325). Thus, the ratio is 2.08 = 11,096/$5,325. This 2.08 ratio compares to the 1.90 reported previously.\n4 Consider the example of a special education student whose needs are met by adding the time of a resource specialist in the regular classroom. There is virtually no additional classroom space required (e.g., capital expenditure), while there is an increase in the time required of professional staff to provide services (e.g., operating expenditure).\n\n53\n\n1-23\n\n\f24th Annual Report to Congress\nFigure 1-3 Changes in Special Education Spending Per Pupil Over Time\n(Excluding Other Special Needs Program Spending)\n\n$14,000 $12,000\n\nS12,474\n\n$12,474\n\n$10,000\n\n$8,000 $6,000\n\n$6,335\n\n$4,000 $2,000\n\n$0 1968-69 1977-78 1985-86 1999-2000\nPer pupil in 1999-2000 dollars\n\n1968-69 1977-78 1985-86 1999-2000\nPer pupil in unadjusted dollars\n\nSource: Special Education Expenditure Project.\nChanges in Spending Over Time\nFigure 1-3 illustrates how expenditures have changed over time by comparing the findings from this study with those from the previous three studies of special education spending sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education. In constant dollars, total spending to educate a student with a disability (excluding Other Special Needs Program Spending) has increased from an average of $9,858 per pupil in 1985-86 to $12,474 in 1999-2000, an annualized growth rate of 0.7%. During this same period, total expenditure per pupil (including all students but excluding Other Special Needs Spending) in public elementary and secondary schools increased from $5,795 to $7,597, an annualized growth rate of 0.8%.\nSince 1968-69, when the earliest study on special education expenditures was conducted, the total per pupil spending on students with disabilities has risen from\n\n1-24\nBEST COPY AVAILABLE 5 4\n\n\fWhat Are We Spending on Special Education Services in the United States, 1999-2000?\n$5,961 to $12,474 in constant dollars, while total spending per pupil in all public elementary and secondary schools (excluding Other Special Needs Program Spending) has increased from $3,106 to $7,597. In other words, total per pupil spending on the average special education student has increased by 110%, while total per pupil spending on a// elementary and secondary education students has increased\nby 140%.\nWhile per pupil spending for all students increased at a faster relative rate than per\npupil spending on students with disabilities, total spending on students with disabilities as a percentage of total education spending (excluding Other Special Needs Program Services) increased from about 16.6% in 1977-19785 to 21.4% in\n1999-2000. Over the same period, the percentage of students ages 3 through 22 who were receiving special education services increased from about 8.5% to almost 13% of the school-age population. The implication is that the growth in the numbers of students served in special education programs accounts for the increase in spending on special education.\nChanges in Spending Ratio Over Time\nFor the past decade, policymakers, researchers, and practitioners familiar with special education finance estimated the ratio of total expenditure (including Other Special Needs Sepnding) to educate a student with a disability to the total expenditure to educate the typical regular education student to be about 1.3. That is, the additional expenditure (i.e., the spending ratio) on a student with disabilities was estimated to be 130% more (1.3 times) than the amount spent on a typical regular education student. However, using the 1999-2000 school year SEEP data, this spending ratio is now estimated to be 1.90 or 90% more than the amount spent on a typical regular\neducation student. Expressed in dollars, the additional expenditure amounts to $5,918 per pupil over the base expenditure of $6,556.6 Figure 1-4 shows how the estimated expenditure ratio has changed over the time-span of the four special education expenditure studies. The ratio appears to have increased from 1.92 in\n\n5 The 1977-78 school year was 2 years after passage of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, P.L. 94-142, the predecessor to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).\n6 Estimates of per pupil expenditure for a regular education student are based on a combination of data from the SEEP school surveys and the surveys for those special education students who spend the vast majority of their time in the regular education classroom. Expenditures for these students include both direct instruction as well as administration and support services provided to the typical regular education student.\n\n55\n\n1-25\n\n\f24' Annual Report to Congress\nFigure 1-4 Ratio of Spending Per Special and Regular Education Student Over Time\n(Including Other Special Needs Program Spending)\n\n2.40\n2.30 2.20 -\n2.10 -\n2.00 -\n1.92 1.90\n1.80 -\n1.70 1968-69\n\n2.17\n1977-78\n\n2.28\n\n1.90\n\n1985-86\n\n1999-2000\n\nSource: Special Education Expenditure Project.\n1968-69, to 2.17 in 1977-78, to a high of 2.28 in 1985-86, then declined to 1.90 in\n1999-2000.7\nSeveral factors have likely affected the changes in this ratio over time. First, there has been a substantial increase in the proportion of students identified with less intensive\nservice needs over recent decades. Since 1975, the proportion of students with learning disabilities has increased from about one fourth of the population of students with disabilities to almost one half. The special educational services necessary to meet these students' needs may not be as costly as other disability\ncategories, thus lowering the overall incremental expenditure.\n\n7 In addition to estimates based on the current SEEP, these ratios are derived from Kakalik et al. (1981), Moore et al. (1988), and Rossmiller et al. (1970). For a summary of these three previous studies, see Chaikind, Danielson, & Brauen (1993). The ratios are estimated from data derived from Chaikind et al. (1993), Table 7.\n1-26\nto EST COPY AVAILABLE- 6\n\n\fWhat Are We Spending on Special Education Services in the United States, 1999-2000?\nSecond, over the past 10 years, there has been a decline in the extent to which special education students are served outside of the regular education classroom and in separate school facilities. These trends toward less restrictive placements may have resulted in somewhat lower per pupil expenditures on special education instruction and related services (e.g., home-to-special-school transportation).8\nWorking in the opposite direction to increase the incremental expenditure are the successes in medical science that have reduced mortality among students with certain severely disabling conditions who might not have survived long enough to be enrolled in special education programs. Some of these students may be among the most severely disabled populations served currently under IDEA, tending to increase the per pupil expenditure necessary to serve students with disabilities overall.\nAllocation of Special Education Expenditures\nComponents of Special Education Spending\nFocusing on the $50 billion of special education spending, it is useful to see how funds are allocated among different spending components. Special education spending includes central office administration and support of the program, direct instruction and related services for preschool (ages 3 through 5) and school-aged (ages 6 through 21) students, special education summer school, programs for students who are homebound or hospitalized, and special transportation services. Figure 1-5 shows the dollar amount and percentage of special education spending on each of these components.\nDirect Instruction and Related Services\nDuring the 1999-2000 school year, over 80% of total special education expenditures\nwere allocated to direct instruction and related services. This figure includes preschool programs, school-aged programs, summer school programs, and homebound and hospital programs. It takes into account the salaries of special education teachers, related service personnel, and special education teaching assistants. It also includes nonpersonnel expenditures (i.e., supplies, materials, and capital outlay for specialized equipment) necessary to provide direct special\neducation instruction and related services to students with disabilities.\n\n8 See Figure III-1 in the 27' Annual Report to Congress on the Implementation of the Individualr with\nDisabilities Education Act.\n\n5\n\n1-27\n\n\f24th Annual Report to Congress\nFigure 1-5 Allocation of Special Education Expenditures, 1999-2000\n\nSchool-aged programs operated\nwithin public schools\n(61%, $30.7 billion)\n\nSchool-aged programs operated outside public schools (11%, $5.3 billion)\nPreschool programs operated within public schools (8%, $4.1 billion)\nPreschool programs operated outside public schools (1%, S263 million)\nOther instructional programs (homebound & summer) (2%, S912 million)\nTransportation services (70/o, $3.7 billion)\nAdministration & support services (10%, $5.0 billion)\n\nSource: Special Education Expenditure Project.\nDirect instruction and related services for special education preschool programs represent approximately 9% of total special education expenditures, or $4.4 billion. The majority of preschool spending ($4.1 billion) occurs in public schools operated by the school districts in which students reside. Most of the remaining funds allocated to preschool programs ($263 million) are used to pay tuition and fees for preschool programs operated in nonpublic schools or public agencies other than the public school district in which the student resides and to support direct expenditures\nfor additional related services.\nAt $36 billion, instruction and related services for school-aged students (ages 6 through 21) account for 72% of total special education expenditures. Direct instruction and related services for programs operated by the student's home district amount to approximately $31 billion. This represents more than 60% of total special education expenditures, serving almost 5.4 million of the 6.2 million special\neducation students in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. For the\napproximately 200,000 students placed in nonpublic school programs or programs operated by public agencies or institutions other than the public school district in which they reside, the expenditure is $5.3 billion. These expenditures include tuition,\n\n1-28\nBEST C Y AVM BLE\n\n5 8\n\n\fWhat Are We Spending on Special Education Services in the United States, 1999-2000?\nfees, and amounts allocated for other related services that are provided by the home district.\nOther instructional programs include homebound and hospital programs, as well as summer school programs for students with disabilities. It is estimated that, for the 1999-2000 school year, just under 30,000 students with disabilities were served in homebound and hospital programs and that these programs account for less than 0.5%, or $98 million, of the total special education spending. Summer school programs serve about 10% of the total number of students (623,000) in special education programs and account for about 1.6% ($815 million) of the total special education expenditures.\nAdministration and Support\nOverall, administration and support account for about 10% or $5 billion of total special education spending. Administration and support expenditures include three components:\nCentral office administration and support of the special education\nprogram$4 billion, or 8.2% of total special education expenditures. This expenditure includes salaries of central office employees, fees for contractors, and nonpersonnel expenditures to support staff in the performance of central office functions for the special education programs. These functions include administration, coordination, staff supervision, monitoring and evaluation, due process, mediation, litigation support, assessment of student\nprogress, and eligibility determination.\nCertain categories of related service personnel assigned to the school site$745 million, or 1.5% of total special education expenditures. These categories of school-site staff spend a substantial portion of their time involved in various indirect support activities related to assessment and\nevaluation of students with disabilities.\nAdministration and support activities of special education schools$131 million, or less than 0.3% of total special education spending. These schools are designed explicitly and exclusively for serving students with disabilities\ngenerally the most severely disabled students.9\n\n9 Special schools include those operated by public school districts as well as state special education schools.\n\n59\n\n1-29\n\n\f24111 Annual Report to Congress\nTransportation\nIt is estimated that more than 800,000 students with disabilities receive special hometo-school transportation services at a total expenditure of more than $3.7 billion. These numbers suggest that less than 14% of students with disabilities received special transportation services during the 1999-2000 school year, representing about\none fourth of total expenditures on all home-to-school transportation services\nprovided in the United States:I'\nSince 1985-86, the percentage of students receiving special transportation has dropped by more than half, and the per pupil expenditure (expressed in constant dollars) has increased from about $2,463 to $4,418 (an increase of 180%).\" These comparative data suggest that fewer students are being transported today to separate special education schools and that perhaps only the most severely disabled students, who require more costly accommodations, are currently receiving special transportation services. The evidence further suggests that more students with\ndisabilities are receiving regular transportation services.\nPer Pupil Spending 011 Special Education Services\nFigure 1-6 provides another perspective for exploring special education expenditure by dividing the total expenditure within each special education program component by the number of students served within that component to arrive at per-pupil spending. These figures include only the special education expenditures associated with each component; they do not include the full expenditure to educate these students since no regular education instruction or administrative expenditures are included in these numbers.\nAverage special education spending on a student served in programs outside the public schools amounted to $26,440. This figure includes spending on the tuition for nonpublic schools and expenditures on any direct, related services that might be\n1\" According to figures reported by the sample districts, it is estimated that total transportation expenditure (regular and special transportation combined) amounts to more than $13 billion per year. Based on these figures, special education transportation represents about 27% of total transportation expenditure.\n\" Moore et al. (1988) reported that 30% of students with disabilities received special transportation services at an average expenditure per student of $1,583. Using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) adjusted to the school year, per student expenditure adjusted to 1999-2000 dollars amounts to $2,463 [=1,583/(108.8/169.3) where 169.3 is the CPI for 1999-2000 school year and 108.8 = the CPI for the 1985-86 school year].\n1-30\n60\n\n\fWhat Are We Spending on Special Education Services in the United States, 1999-2000?\nFigure 1-6 Per Pupil Special Education Spending, 1999-2000\n\n$30,000 $25,000\n\n$26,440\n\n$20,000\n\n$15,000\n\n$10,000 $5,000\n\n$4,388\n\n$7,667\n\n$9,062\n\n$5,709\n\n$4,418\n\n$662\n\n$0\n\nCentral office Special school administration of administration\nthe program and support\n\nI reschool\n\nI reschool\n\nSchool-aged School-aged Tra esportation\n\nI rograms\n\nprogams\n\nprograms\n\nprograms\n\nTrvices\n\nope ated within operated outside operated waNn operated outside\n\npublic schools public schools public schools public schools\n\nSource: Special Education Expenditure Project.\nprovided by the district of residence. In contrast, special education spending on direct instruction and related services for school-aged students served within public schools amounted to $5,709 per pupil. For preschool students, the special education spending on students served in programs operated outside public schools amounted to $9,062 per pupil compared to $7,667 for those students served in programs within public schools.\n\nThe expenditures on central office administration of the special education program (i.e., the operations of the office of the director of special education within local education agencies) amounted to $662 per pupil. Administration and support expenditures for operation of a special education school averaged $4,388.12\n\n12 This figure includes both special education schools operated within local school districts as well as those operated by the state such as the state schools for the deaf and blind.\n\nBEST COPY AVAILABLE\n\n61\n\n1-31\n\n\f24111 Annual Report to Congress\nExpenditures On Assessment, Evaluation, and IEP-Related Activities\nPrevious studies have suggested that expenditures for the processes that determine the eligibility of students to be served in the special education program take up a substantial share of total special education spending.\u00b0 For the purposes of this study, determination of eligibility involves a variety of activities, including prereferral and referral activities; initial screening; ongoing assessment, evaluations, and reviews; and preparation of the individualized education program (IEP).\nBased on SEEP data, it is estimated that total spending on eligibility determination activities during the 1999-2000 school year was about $6.8 billion, or $1,086 per special education student.\" As Figure 1-7 indicates, 28% of the total expenditure on these activities is accounted for by salaries and benefits of special education relatedservice providers at the school site, while 27% is spent on special education teachers, 23% on regular education teachers, and 22% on central office special education staff.\nIt is important to recognize that the $1,086 per pupil does not represent the\nexpenditure to determine the eligibility for any given student. While the figures above\nreflect the best estimates of the total dollars supporting these activities, the\ndenominator is simply the count of special education students. Some students who go through this process for determining eligibility are found ineligible to receive special education services. On the other hand, re-evaluations of students who are already in the special education program can, in many instances, be done with relatively limited effort on the part of staff.\nAllocation and Use of Federal Funds\nIn 1999-2000, local school districts received a total of $3.7 billion (or $605 per student) in Federal IDEA funds for the purpose of providing special education services.\u00b0 As such, Federal funds supported 7.5% of total special education expenditures at the local level and 4.9% of total expenditures used to educate a student with disabilities.

The average per pupil amount of Federal funding awarded to the states for 1999-2000 was about $734 (or $4.5 billion, including $4.2 billion from the basic grant and $371 million for the preschool grant). Approximately 17% of the Federal funds were retained at the state level.\n\n1-32\n\n62\n\nc.\n\n\fWhat Are We Spending on Special Education Services in the United States, 1999-2000?\nFigure 1-7 Assessment, Evaluation, and IEP-Related Expenditures, 1999-2000\n\nSpecial Education Teachers\n27% ($1.8 billion)\n\nRelated Service Providers at the\nSchool Site 28% ($1.9 billion)\n\nCentral Office Staff 22% ($1.5 billion)\n\nSource: Special Education Expenditure Project.\na special versus regular education student, Federal IDEA funds amounted to more than 10% of the additional expenditure on students with disabilities for the 1999-\n2000 school year.16\nFigure 1-8 shows how these Federal IDEA fundsbasic and preschoolare\nallocated to instruction, related services, and administration, and it compares the use of Federal funds to the use of all Federal and non-Federal funds that support special education spending.

In districts reporting how the preschool funds were spent, almost three fourths of the funds were used for instruction, 21% were allocated to related services, and the remaining 6% were expended on administration and support\nservices.\nMedicaid is another source of Federal funding for providing special education services. Of reporting districts, 44% of districts recovered funds spent on special education services from Medicaid, with an average of $105 per special education student.

Further analysis will also examine specific components of special education expenditures such as due process, assessment and the processes surrounding the development of individualized education programs, and transportation services.\n\n6 5\n\n1-35\n\n\f24th Annual Report to Congress\nReferences\nChaikind, S., Danielson, L.C., & Brauen, M.L.

This figure represents 16% of all U.S. children under the age of 18 (Dalaker, 2001). The Census Bureau poverty threshold for a\nfamily of four was $18,267 in 2001.\nChild poverty has implications for the field of special education because it can affect children's health and behavior, as well as their cognitive development and academic\nachievement. Although poverty has not been established as a direct cause of\ndisability, studies show that it \"acts as a proxy for many of the variables that in turn increase the risk of disability. Inadequate prenatal care, single teenage pregnancy, poor nutrition, and low educational attainment, while not exclusive to any one segment of society, are more readily encountered among the poor\" (Seelman & Sweeney, 1995, p. 3). Researchers have found that poverty trends are exacerbated when a child with a disability lives in the household; they also have identified an increased risk of disability among children in poor families (Fujiura & Yamaki, 2000). The association between poverty and disability is therefore an important issue for special education researchers to address.\nChild poverty is of importance to special education service delivery for another reason as well. The initial funding formula for P.L. 94-142 based allocations on the number of children with disabilities receiving special education and related services in each state. However, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Amendments of 1997 revised the funding formula so that a percentage of the funds allocated to each state is based on the relative population of children living in poverty in that state. This change in the funding formula, which took effect in Federal fiscal year (FFY) 1998 for the Preschool Grants Program and FFY 2000 for the Grants to States program, has heightened the importance of studying child\npoverty in relation to children with disabilities.\nThe study reported in this module uses base-year data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K) to examine the effects of poverty and associated variables on cognitive assessment scores and social skills ratings. It also compares the demographic characteristics of poor and nonpoor\nkindergartners with disabilities.\n\n67\n\n1-37\n\n\f24111 Annual Report to Congress\nThe module begins with a review of the literature on the physical, cognitive, and behavioral effects that poverty may have on children. Subsequent sections explain the methods used in the study and present the study findings. The final section of the module discusses those findings in relation to the literature and suggests directions for future research.\nPoverty and Child Development\nResearch has demonstrated that poverty may have an impact on children's physical health, their cognitive development and achievement, and their behavior. This section of the module discusses some of the research in each of these areas.\nPhysical Health\nThe literature suggests a general relationship between children's health and family income, with lower income families reporting that their children are in poorer health (e.g., Brooks-Gunn & Duncan, 1997; Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics, 2001). In addition to differences in general measures of child health, research indicates that poor children are more likely to experience a number of specific health-related problems that may lead to eligibility for services under IDEA. One example is low birth weight (LBW), which is defined as weighing less than 2,500 grams at birth. LBW significantly increases the risk of long-term disability and early mortality (Ventura, Martin, Curtin, & Mathews, 1997) and is associated with higher rates of specific health problems such as childhood asthma (Brooks, Byrd, Weitzman, Auinger, & McBride, 2001). It is also associated with learning disabilities and with negative school outcomes such as grade repetition, as well as lower levels of intelligence and of math and reading achievement (Brooks-Gunn & Duncan, 1997). LBW children frequently score lower on intelligence tests than do children of normal birth weight, even after controlling for other sociodemographic variables (Hack, Klein, & Taylor, 1995). Low birth weight is 1.7 times more common among poor children than nonpoor children (Federman et al., as cited in BrooksGunn & Duncan, 1997).\nLead poisoning is another health problem that occurs more frequently in poor children, as well as those living in older housing (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2000). Even low levels of lead exposure can have negative effects, and health problems vary with the length and intensity of exposure and the child's developmental stage, with risks beginning before birth (Brooks-Gunn & Duncan, 1997). Lead exposure is associated with health problems such as hearing loss (Schwartz & Otto, 1991) and damage to the renal, endocrine, reproductive, and central nervous systems (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 1993). It is also associated with a decrease in intelligence quotient (IQ) (Schwartz, 1994), a\n1-38\n6 8\n\n\fChildren With Disabilities in Low-Income Families: An Analysis of Data From the ECLS-K\n\nproblem that is discussed in detail later in this module, and with a range of behavior problems (National Research Council (NRC), 2002). Studies using Federal data have repeatedly indicated that poor and minority children are at greater risk for lead poisoning, a risk that is compounded by the fact that low-income families are more likely to live in older housing (Brody et al., 1994; CDC, 1997; President's Task Force on Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children, 2000). The most recent prevalence data indicate that 8% of children in low-income families have elevated blood lead levels, compared with about 2% of middle-income children and 1% of high-income children. About 11% of Black children have elevated blood lead levels, as do 4% of Mexican American children and 1% of White children (Needleham, as cited in NRC, 2002).\n\nCognitive Abil, and Achievement\n\nThe NRC (2002) has noted that child outcomes are indisputably worse in families with low socioeconomic status but that the reasons for this difference are complex. Nonetheless, poorer outcomes, both academically and behaviorally, often result in referrals for special education and related services. This section of the module first reviews some of the studies showing differences in cognitive outcomes by poverty status, then discusses some of the biological and environmental influences on\ncognitive ability and achievement.\n\nDifferences in AbiliO, and Achievement\n\nA number of studies have demonstrated that child poverty is associated with lower scores on standardized ability and achievement tests. In general, the IQ scores of poor children average 5 to 10 points lower than those of middle-class comparison samples, and a greater number of poor children fall into the range of borderline or mild mental retardation (Kaiser & Delaney, 1996)1. Some of these differences may be due to lead poisoning, which, as noted above, is associated with a decrease in IQ as well as with various physical problems. Poor nutrition and maternal alcohol and tobacco use during pregnancy are other biological factors that are associated with\nlower achievement (NRC, 2002).\n\nA number of studies have shown that children from lower income families have poorer academic outcomes than do children from middle-class families. For example, one study used National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) data to compare children in families with incomes below 50% of the poverty threshold to\n\n1 Since many standardized ability and achievement tests were developed for and normed on White, middle-class children, test bias may also influence the scores of lower income and minority children.\n\n69\n\n1-39\n\n\f24th Annual Report to Congress\nchildren whose family incomes were between 1.5 and 2 times the poverty threshold. After controlling for characteristics associated with poverty (e.g., family structure, mother's education), the poorer children scored 6 to 13 points lower on standardized tests of IQ, verbal ability, and achievement (Korenman, Miller, & Sjaastad, 1995). (Many standardized tests have a standard deviation of 10 points.)\nDuncan and his colleagues (1994) used the Infant Health and Development Program dataset to investigate poverty and IQ scores in 5-year-olds. The IQ scores of children who had lived in persistent poverty were an average of 9 points lower than those of children who had not experienced poverty at all in their first 5 years of life (SE = 2.1), while those who had experienced short-term poverty were an average of 4 points lower (SE = 1.6).\nIn addition to test scores, school outcomes such as high school graduation rates also differ by poverty status. These differences may be related both to cognitive ability and achievement and to behavioral problems, an issue that is discussed later in this module. Data from Series 10 of Vital Health and Statistics (as cited in Brooks-Gunn & Duncan, 1997) indicate that poor children are twice as likely as nonpoor children to repeat a grade or to be suspended or expelled. Children from low-income families are also significantly less likely to graduate from high school. In 1999, there was an 11% dropout rate among students whose family incomes were in the bottom 20% of the income distribution. This figure may be compared with the 5% dropout rate among students from middle-income families and the 2.1% dropout rate among\nthose in the top 20% of the income distribution (Kaufman, Kwon, Klein, &\nChapman, 2000).\nLead poisoning also has negative effects on cognitive ability and achievement. As previously discussed, research has consistently demonstrated that exposure to lead is associated with lower IQs. According to the National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH, 1998), even low levels of lead exposure have been shown to be related to decreased intelligence. Lead poisoning is also associated with learning disabilities and behavioral problems (National Academy of Sciences, 1993; NCEH, 2001). In a meta-analysis of studies examining the relationship between blood lead levels and IQ in school-aged children, Schwartz (1994) found that an increase in blood lead from 10 to 20 micrograms per deciliter was associated with a decrease of 2.6 IQ points. Since lead poisoning is disproportionately found among poor children (CDC, 1997, 2000), this environmental hazard must be considered as one of the factors that contributes to problems with cognitive development and achievement in this population.\n1-40\n\n\fChildren With Disabilities in Low-Income Families: An Analysis of Data From the ECLS-K\nSocial and Environmental Influences on Cognitive Development\nAlthough the evidence does suggest that biological factors play a role in achievement differences, those influences are only part of the story. More than 20 years ago, Urie\nBronfenbrenner (1979) presented an ecological model of child development\nsuggesting that biology, family, caregivers, school, and other contextual influences all\nhave powerful and reciprocal influences on human development. This seminal research led to the current understanding that \"biological and environmental factors are not completely separate parts of the picture. . . . They combine as two pigments in a single paint, together determining a color that neither alone could create\" (NRC, 2002, p. 94). Moreover, in the past two decades, researchers have increasingly adopted the view that the number and combination of risk factors in a child's life have a powerful influence on that child's development. As the number of stresses\nrises, the probability of a positive outcome declines (NRC, 2002).\nWhile some of the differences in cognitive ability and achievement discussed above are related to biological factors such as lead exposure, others may be attributed to\ndifferences in home and family environments and to multiple risks and the interactions among them. As the NRC (2002) notes, \"Children, themselves tremendously diverse in the individual characteristics they bring into the world, develop in family and community contexts that vary widely\" (p. 121). Further,\npoverty \"is strongly correlated with less optimal home environments\" (NRC, 2002, p. 123).\nA wide range of social and contextual factors influence child development and, in turn, affect the likelihood that a child will be referred for special education. For example, many studies have demonstrated that parenting styles, parental responsiveness and sensitivity to the child, and the amount and type of language stimulation provided to the child all strongly influence a child's intellectual and problem-solving abilities (NRC, 2002).\nIn addition, early language development is a key element of later school success. Vocabulary size is the single most important predictor of reading success (Anderson & Nagy, as cited in NRC, 2002). But studies have consistently demonstrated that children from low-income families have smaller vocabularies than those from middle-class families (Hart & Risley, 1995) and that there is a connection between parents' and children's vocabularies (NRC, 2002). These effects are dramatic: After observing children for a period of nearly 2 1/2 years, Hart and Risley (1995) found that by the time the children were 3 years old, their families' SES accounted for 42% of the variance in their rates of vocabulary growth, 40% of the variance in their vocabulary use, and 29% of the variance in their measured IQ scores. These\n\n71\n\n1-41\n\n\f24th Annual Report to Congress\ndifferences may be largely attributable to differences in home environments. The NRC (2002) reports that in a number of studies, \"higher-SES mothers have been found to talk to children more, sustain conversation longer, and elicit more response from the child\" (p. 125).\nDemographic Characteristics Associated With Lower Achievement\nIn addition to the social and environmental factors discussed above, two family demographic characteristics that are associated with lower academic achievementsingle parenthood and lower parental education levelsare found more frequently among poor children and families. Some researchers have suggested that these characteristics are related to school problems that may result in referrals to special education. The NRC (2002) has reported that \"poverty is highly correlated with single-parent status, decreasing the parental attention available to the child\" (p. 122). Astone and McLanahan (1991) suggest that family structure may be related to low academic achievement and school failure. They note that \"children from nonintact families report lower educational expectations on the part of their parents, less monitoring of school work by mothers and fathers, and less overall supervision of\nsocial activities than children from intact families\" (p. 318).\nIn their classic longitudinal study of adolescent mothers and their children,\nFurstenberg and his colleagues (1987) noted that single-parent homes may differ from two-parent homes in that \"child supervision is reduced, time spent with the parent is low, and emotional support is difficult in part because of competing demands on a single parent's time\" (p. 107). Although mother's marital status appeared to have only weak effects on preschool outcomes in the Furstenberg et al. study, at follow-up the researchers found that among adolescents, having a single mother was associated with grade failure and behavior problems (Furstenberg, Brooks-Gunn, & Morgan, 1987). Analyses of ECLS-K data carried out by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) found that first-time kindergartners from two-parent families were more likely than those from single-parent families to have reading, mathematics, and general knowledge scores in the highest quartile (NCES, 2000).\nParent education levels may also influence child outcomes. Furstenberg and his colleagues (1987) found that mother's educational status did not appear to influence children's scores on a preschool inventory. By adolescence, however, having a mother who did not complete high school was associated with a considerably higher likelihood of grade failure. ECLS-K analyses performed by NCES found that children whose mothers had higher education levels were more likely to score in the highest quartile on all three cognitive measures (NCES, 2000). Zill (1996), reviewing the literature on the link between parent education and child well-being, noted that\n1-42\n\n\fChildren With Disabilities in Low-Income Families: An Analysis of Data From the ECLS-K\nparent education level is an important independent determinant of well-being among children.\nWhile single parenthood and lower parental educational attainment are by no means found exclusively among poor families, these demographic characteristics are\nstrongly associated with poverty. NCES analyses of ECLS-K data suggest that mother's education and family type, along with home language and the family's receipt of public assistance, influence not only kindergartners' cognitive skill\ndevelopment but their health and physical well-being, social skills, and approaches to learning (NCES, 2000).\nBehavioral Outcomes\nResearch suggests a link between childhood poverty and behavior problems, although poverty's effects on behavioral outcomes are not as pronounced as its effects on cognitive outcomes (Brooks-Gunn & Duncan, 1997). This link is important because behavior problems frequently result in referrals to special\neducation (NRC, 2002).\nAn analysis of data from the NLSY on 3- through 11-year-olds looked at behavior problems in poor and nonpoor children. Children who lived in long-term poverty scored three to seven percentile points higher on a behavior problem index than did children from nonpoor families (Korenman et al., 1995). McLeod and Shanahan (1993), also using NLSY data, found that persistent poverty was positively related to the occurrence of internalizing symptoms such as anxiety and unhappiness in 4- to 8year-olds. This finding held true after controlling for mother's age, education, marital status, and current poverty as determined by family income divided by household\nsize. Current (as opposed to persistent) poverty was associated with greater\noccurrence of externalizing symptoms, such as hyperactivity and peer conflict.\nA study using the Infant Health and Development Program dataset found greater prevalence of both internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in children from persistently poor families. Children whose families experienced short-term poverty also had more behavioral problems than did nonpoor children, although the differences were not as pronounced. Both the short-term and long-term poverty analyses controlled for mother's education and family structure (Duncan, BrooksGunn, & Klebanov, 1994).\nAn analysis of the ECLS-K (NCES, 2000) examined problem behaviors among firsttime kindergartners in general and found some differences by family type. The\n1-43\n7 3\n\n\f2411 Annual Report to Congress\nincidence of problem behaviors was relatively infrequent as reported by both parents and teachers, although parents reported more of these behaviors than did teachers Single mothers were more likely than respondents from two-parent families to report their children as arguing, fighting, or getting angry often or very often. Similarly,\nteachers were more likely to rate children from single-parent households as exhibiting problem behavior (NCES, 2000). The NCES analyses did not examine\ndifferences in behavior by poverty status.\nSome of the differences in behavioral outcomes by poverty status may be due to the biological effects of exposure to substances such as lead, alcohol, and nicotine (see the Twen(y-Second Annual Report to Congress on the Implementation of IDEA for a discussion of prenatal alcohol and tobacco exposure and NRC, 2002, for a full discussion of all three issues). However, behavioral outcomes are also related to differences in home environment and parenting practices. A number of studies cited in the recent NRC report (2002) indicate that social and economic disadvantage have\n\"strong and negative effects\" on parenting practices (p. 123). Research has demonstrated, for example, that \"social disadvantage predicted harsh parental\ndiscipline, which in turn predicted aggressive child behavior\" (Bank et al., as cited in NRC, 2002, p. 123). In addition, researchers have found that preschoolers in lowincome welfare families have the highest prevalence of oppositional defiant disorder (Offord et al., as cited in NRC, 2002). Early behavioral problems strongly predict later behavioral problems. As is true of cognitive and academic outcomes, it is likely\nthat a combination of biological and contextual factors contributes to the poorer behavioral outcomes that have been observed among low-income children (NRC,\n2002).\nSummary of the Literature Review\nAlthough research does not directly link disability among children to poverty status, poor children arc more likely than nonpoor children to experience LBW and other\nhealth complications related to poor maternal nutrition and health care. These children are also less likely to have the adequate nutrition, housing, and health care that might prevent the development of serious health conditions and disabilities (Meyers, Lukemeycr, & Smeeding, 1996). The studies reviewed here indicate that childhood poverty is issociated with lower general health status and with higher levels of health problems such as LBW, asthma, and lead poisoning. In addition, child poverty is associated with problems in cognitive development, behavior\nproblems, and negative school outcomes.\nHealth problems such as LBW occur more frequently in groups with higher poverty rates, particularly among families headed by single mothers and families in which mothers have lower education levels (Brooks-Gunn & Duncan, 1997). Among\n1-44\n74\n\n\fChildren With Disabilities in Low-Income Families: An Analysis of Data From the ECLS-K\nkindergartners, these demographic characteristics also have been linked to lower scores on measures of reading, mathematics, and general knowledge, and to increased reports of behavioral problems (NCES, 2000). Because these relationships may make it difficult to interpret the independent effects of each variable, the study described below examined the effects of poverty and mother's education and family type while controlling for poverty on outcomes such as cognitive assessment scores and social skills ratings for kindergartners with disabilities. The study also attempted to determine the influence of the three explanatory variables, poverty, mother's education, and family type, on the likelihood of having an individualized education program (IEP). Finally, analyses were conducted to determine how poor and\nnonpoor children differ in terms of demographic characteristics.\nMethods\nThe study described here used spring data from the base year of the ECLS-K, which is being conducted by NCES. The Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) also contributes funding and support for the study.\nThe ECLS-K involves direct assessment of children's skills and abilities in order to measure important cognitive and noncognitive outcomes. The cognitive assessment battery included questions in three subject areas: language and literacy, mathematical thinking, and general knowledge. In addition to these direct assessment data, parents and guardians provided information about their children and their households, and teachers provided data about the children and their learning environments. The primary special education teacher or service provider for each child with an IEP also provided data. Since poverty was the primary independent variable of interest and family income data were collected from parents and guardians only in the spring, this study used direct child assessment data, parent data, and teacher data from spring\n1999.\nThe ECLS-K sample included more than 21,000 children. Data were available for 677 kindergartners with IEPs.2 Researchers selected weights in consultation with statistical staff and varied according to the type of data that were being analyzed. We used the parent full-sample weight for analyses of child and parent data and the child-parent-teacher full-sample weight for analyses that included teacher data.\n2 Throughout this module, the terms \"children with IEPs\" and \"children with disabilities\" are used interchangeably.\n1-45\n\n\f24th Annual Report to Congress\nResults\nDescriptive statistics for all students with disabilities, based on our analyses of the ECLS-K, are presented in Table 1-2. The table includes population estimates for all kindergartners with IEPs, regardless of poverty status.\nThe mean income of families of children with disabilities was $40,880, and the median income was $29,294. To compare kindergartners with IEPs living in poverty with those who were not living in poverty, we began with the 1998 Census Bureau poverty threshold of $16,660 for a family of four. To account for factors such as regional differences in the cost of living and in accordance with other recent literature (e.g., Duncan & Brooks-Gunn as cited in Duncan, Yeung, Brooks-Gunn, Smith, & Judith, 1998), we used 150% of the poverty level to arrive at a working poverty threshold of $24,990 for a family of four.' This threshold was well below the sample's mean and median incomes. The poverty variable was computed by dividing household income by the total number of household members.\nAbout 55% of the families of ECLS-K kindergartners with disabilities reported incomes above the threshold of $24,990 for a family of four; 45% of children with disabilities lived in households with incomes below this threshold. Thus, for the purpose of these analyses, children whose household income was below 150% of the Federal poverty threshold were considered to be poor. Those whose family incomes were at or above the 150% poverty level were considered nonpoor.\nOf the demographic data for all kindergartners with IEPs, two findings were of particular note. Sixty-five percent were male, a difference that is not unexpected given that boys tend to outnumber girls among the special education population (U.S. Department of Education, 1998). In addition, the percentage of kindergartners with IEPs who were poor was higher than one might observe in the general population. The U.S. Department of Education (1997) has noted that poverty among children is associated with educational problems that result in referrals to special\neducation, so this finding is again not surprising.\n3 The 150% threshold is also in line with Federal guidelines for free and reduced-price meals. Children in families with incomes below 130% of the Federal poverty guidelines are eligible to receive free meals, while those whose family incomes are below 185% of the guidelines are eligible for reduced-price meals (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2001).\n1-46\n7 6\n\n\fChildren With Disabilities in Low-Income Families: An Analysis of Data From the ECLS-K\n\nTable 1-2\nDemographic Variables for All Kindergartners With IEPs\n\nSex Male Female\nRace/ethnicity\nWhite, non-Hispanic Black Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander Other\nPoverty status Poor Nonpoor\nFamily type Single-parent family/other Two-parent family\nMother's education Less than high school High school diploma or some college Bachelor's degree or higher\nFather's education\nLess than high school High school diploma or some college Bachelor's degree or higher\nPrimary disability category Speech or language impairment Learning disability Developmental delay Mental retardation Health impairment Physical impairment Autism Multiple impairments Emotional disturbance Deaf/hard of hearing Blind/visual impairment Deaf/blind\nFamily received AFDC/TANF in the last 12 months\nYes No\nFamily received food stamps in the last 12 months\nYes\nNo\n\nNational estimates\n\nNumber\n\nPercent\n\n92,110 49,100\n87,787 22,630 23,241\n1,538 5,428\n63,645 77,565\n38,575 102,634\n26,512 90,646 20,543\n15,282 71,708 19,189\n95,610 16,988 13,975 4,301\n3,589 3,176 2,957 2,776 2,527\n881 224\n0\n17,215 122,336\n36,326 103,224\n\n65.2 34.8\n62.4 16.1 16.5\n1.1\n3.9\n45.1 54.9\n27.3 72.7\n19.3 65.8 14.9\n14.4 67.5 18.1\n65.0 11.6 9.5 2.9 2.4 2.2\n2.0 1.9 1.7 0.6 0.2 0.0\n12.3 87.7\n26.0 74.0\n\n1-47\n\n\f24th Annual Report to Congress\n\nTable 1-2 (continued)\n\nNational estimates\n\nNumber\n\nPercent\n\nChild receives free or reduced-price lunch\nYes No\nChild covered by health insurance\nYes\nNo\n\n60,076\n\n67.1\n\n29,403\n\n32.9\n\n131,047\n\n93.5\n\n9,117\n\n6.5\n\nSource: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Early\nChildhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99, Base-Year Restricted-Use Special Education Child File.\n\nDemographic Variables\n\nResearchers compared poor and nonpoor kindergartners with IEPs on nine demographic variables: sex, race, family type (two-parent vs. one-parent/other),\nmother's education, father's education, family receipt of AFDC/TANF in the past 12 months, family receipt of food stamps in the past 12 months, child's receipt of free or reduced-price lunch, and child health insurance coverage (see Table 1-3). All of the chi squares were significant (p < .0001) except for sex and child health insurance coverage. Nonpoor children with IEPs were more likely to be White and to live in a two-parent family.\n\nThe differences in parent education levels were particularly striking. As would be expected, the mothers and fathers of poor kindergarmers with IEPs had lower levels of education than did the parents of the nonpoor children. Particularly noticeable\nwere the differences in the percentages of parents who had less than a high school education. Fully a third of mothers of poor children with IEPs did not finish high school, compared with 7% of mothers of nonpoor children with IEPs. Twenty-nine percent of fathers of poor children had less than a high school diploma, versus 7% of fathers of nonpoor children (see Table 1-3).\n\nCognitive Assessment Scores and Social Skills Ratings\nThe next step in the data analyses was to compare the scaled scores of poor and nonpoor children with disabilities on the three direct cognitive assessments: general knowledge, mathematics, and reading. As Table 1-4 shows, poor children with disabilities had lower scores than nonpoor children with disabilities in all three areas\n(p < .0001).\n\n1-48\n'7 8\n\n\fChildren With Disabilities in Low-Income Families: An Analysis of Data From the ECLS-K\n\nTable 1-3\nDemographic Variables for Kindergartners With IEPs by Poverty Status\n\nPoor\n\nNonpoor\n\nRow percent Row percent\n\nSex Male Female\n\n64.4\n\n66.0\n\n35.7\n\n34.1\n\nRace/ethnicity\nWhite, non-Hispanic Black Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander Other\n\n46.9\n\n75.2\n\n26.1\n\n7.9\n\n22.2\n\n11.8\n\n0.7\n\n1.5\n\n4.2\n\n3.6\n\nFamily type Single-parent/other Two-parent\n\n48.9\n\n15.9\n\n51.1\n\n84.1\n\nMother's education Less than high school High school diploma or some college Bachelor's degree or higher\n\n33.8\n\n7.4\n\n63.4\n\n67.8\n\n2.8\n\n24.8\n\nFather's education\nLess than high school High school diploma or some college Bachelor's degree or higher\n\n29.1\n\n6.8\n\n68.1\n\n67.2\n\n2.8\n\n26.0\n\nFamily received AFDC/TANF in the last 12 months\nYes\nNo\n\n23.3\n\n3.3\n\n76.7\n\n96.7\n\nFamily received food stamps in the last 12 months\nYes No\n\n52.3\n\n4.3\n\n47.7\n\n95.7\n\nChild receives free or reduced-price lunch\nYes No\n\n94.7\n\n35.3\n\n5.3\n\n64.7\n\nChild covered by health insurance\nYes No\n\n92.4\n\n94.4\n\n7.6\n\n5.6\n\nNote: All comparisons were statistically significant (p < .0001) except for sex and health insurance coverage.\nSource: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99, Base-Year Restricted-Use Special Education Child File.\n\n1-49\n7 9\n\n\f24th Annual Report to Congress\n\nTable 1-4\nCognitive Assessment Scores and Social Skills Ratings by Poverty Status\n\nMean scores\n\nPoor\n\nNonpoor\n\n(SE)\n\n(SE)\n\nCognitive skills General knowledge\nReading\nMathematics\n\n18.75 (0.48) 23.33 (0.61) 19.35 (0.51)\n\n25.14k/ (0.58) 28.11k/ (0.66) 24.47k/ (0.60)\n\nParent ratings of social skills Approaches to learning Self-control Social interaction Impulsive/overactivea/ Sad/lonelya/\n\n2.90 (0.04) 2.63 (0.06) 3.22 (0.04) 2.28 (0.05) 1.59 (0.03)\n\n3.02d/ (0.04) 2.78 (0.03) 3.31 (0.04) 2.12d/ (0.04) 1.59 (0.02)\n\nTeacher ratings of social skills Approaches to learning\nSelf-control Interpersonal Externalizing problem behaviorsa/ Internalizing problem behaviorsa/\n\n2.57 (0.06) 2.95 (0.04) 2.80 (0.05) 1.87 (0.07) 1.84 (0.04)\n\n2.82c/ (0.06) 3.01 (0.05) 2.951/ (0.05) 1.76 (0.05)\n1.7211/\n(0.04)\n\nNotes: Standard errors are in parentheses.\n\na/\n\nOn these scales, lower scores are better; on the other social rating scales\n\nand the cognitive skills measures, higher scores are better.\n\nb/ p < .0001.\n\np < .01.\n\nd/\n\np < .05.\n\nSource: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Early Childhood\nLongitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99, Base-Year Restricted-Use Special Education Child File.\n\n1-50\n\nBEST COPY A\\iAILABLE\n\n8 0\n\n\fChildren With Disabilities in Low-Income Families: An Analysis of Data From the ECLS-K\nThe ECLS-K included parent and teacher ratings of social skills using the Social Rating Scale (SRS). The parent SRS has five subscales approaches to learning, selfcontrol, social interaction, impulsive/overactive, and sad/lonely scored on a 4point Likert-type scale, with 1=Never and 4=Very Often. The teacher SRS, which is scored in the same way, also has five subscales: approaches to learning, self-control, interpersonal, externalizing problem behaviors, and internalizing problem behaviors.\nComparisons of poor and nonpoor kindergartners yielded statistically significant differences on the approaches to learning and impulsive/overactive subscales (see Table 1-4). Differences on the self-control subscale approached but did not achieve significance. In each case, nonpoor kindergartners with IEPs scored better than poor kindergartners with IEPs. On the teacher SRS, there were significant differences by poverty status on three subscales: approaches to learning, interpersonal, and internalizing problem behaviors. On each of these subscales, poor children scored worse than nonpoor children (see Table 1-4).\nEffects of Family Type and Mother's Education\nThe results reported above indicate that poor and nonpoor kindergartners with IEPs varied in terms of cognitive assessment scores and social skills ratings. However, it is\nunclear to what extent these effects are attributable to poverty rather than to demographic characteristics such as mother's education and family type that the\nliterature suggests may be associated with lower achievement. For this reason, linear models were developed to analyze the effects of mother's education and family type on kindergartners' cognitive assessment scores and social skills scores while controlling for poverty.\nThe results of the linear model suggest that poverty had a negative effect, or\ninfluence, on all three cognitive assessment scores. (This does not imply that poverty directly caused the scores to be lower; it merely shows that the poverty variable influenced the scores and that the direction of the influence was negative.) Mother's education had the only other significant effect: Among poor kindergartners, children whose mothers had less than a high school education were significantly more likely to have a lower math score. Among nonpoor children, those whose mothers had at\nleast a bachelor's degree had significantly higher scores on all three cognitive measures. Family type did not have an independent effect on cognitive assessment\nscores after controlling for poverty.\nIn regard to the SRS scores, poverty alone had a negative effect on teacher ratings of approaches to learning. Among nonpoor children, maternal education of at least a bachelor's degree had a positive effect on teacher ratings of internalizing problem\n1-51\n8 1\n\n\f24\" Annual Report to Congress\nbehaviors. Family type influenced social interaction and impulsive behavior as rated by parents and externalizing problem behaviors as rated by teachers. Kindergartners from poor one-parent families scored worse on those subscales.\nOne explanation for the apparent overall lack of influence of mother's education and family typc is that the final models controlled for poverty. Preliminary analyses showing effects for those two explanatory variables did not control for poverty, which turned out to be strongly associated for both. Thus, the apparent initial effects of mother's education and family type may have been largely attributable to poverty.\nOdds Ratio for Having an IEP\nFinally, we developed a logistic regression model and calculated an odds ratio to predict thc likelihood of having an IEP, using poverty status, family type, and mother's education as predictors. An odds ratio greater than 1.0 indicates a direct or positive relationship between two variables.\nPoverty had the only significant main effect at the .05 level. The odds of having an IEP were 1.5 times greater for children living in poverty (95% confidence interval, 1.15, 1.97). The interactions of family type and mother's education were not significant.\nDiscussion\nThe findings of this study are limited for several reasons. The ECLS-K was not designed for making comparisons between groups of students based on poverty status, nor was it designed specifically to look at children with disabilities. Another significant limitation is the age of the children at the time the base-year data were collected, since kindergartners have a very different disability distribution than do older children. Data collected in later years of the study may prove more useful for research on students with disabilities. In addition, because the ECLS-K did not oversample for children with IEPs, this subpopulation accounts for only a small proportion of the full sample.\nThese limitations notwithstanding, the analyses of the ECLS-K reported here yielded some interesting findings. Poor and nonpoor kindergartners with disabilities in this study differed on most demographic variables. Poor kindergartners with IEPs scored lower on all three cognitive assessment measures and on several of the parent and teacher SRS subscales. Poor children were 1.5 times more likely to have an IEP than were nonpoor children. The findings reported here suggest that mother's education\n1-52\n8 2\n\n\fChildren With Disabilities in Low-Income Families: An Analysis of Data From the ECLS-K\nand family type have few effects on outcomes for kindergartners with IEPs when controlling for poverty.\nOSEP's current longitudinal studies of students with disabilities, particularly the Special Education Elementary Longitudinal Study (SEELS), the second National Longitudinal Transition Study (NLTS2), and the upcoming Pre-Elementary Longitudinal Study (PEELS), will provide information about poverty status and students with disabilities.

A state could, at its own discretion, define \"developmental delay\" to ensure that all eligible preschool-aged children with disabilities were provided a free appropriate public education without being inappropriately labeled under one of the other disability categories used for school-aged children and youth. The IDEA Amendments of 1997 added some additional requirements pertaining to states' use of developmental delay. Congressional intent is clearly stated in the amendments' legislative history:\n\"[t]he bill expands the definition for service eligibility in part B called \"developmental delay,\" to be used at state and local discretion, for children\nages three through nine. The use of a specific disability category to determine a child's eligibility for special education and related services frequently has led\nto the use of the category to drive the development of the child's\nIndividualized Education Program (IEP) and placement to a greater extent than the child's needs. The committee believes that, in the early years of a child's development, it is often difficult to determine the precise nature of the child's disability. Use of \"developmental delay\" as part of a unified approach will allow the special education and related services to be directly related to the child's needs and prevent locking the child into an eligibility category which may be inappropriate or incorrect, and could actually reduce later referrals of children with disabilities to special education\" (S. Rep. No. 105-17, 1997, pp. 6-7).\nThe 1997 amendments included three overall changes to previous developmental delay requirements. The age range to which developmental delay may apply was expanded to cover ages 3 through 9, and use of the developmental delay category for this expanded age range was stipulated as optional for states. In addition, once a state has adopted use of developmental delay, defined the term, and established an age range, local education agencies (LEAs) were given the option of using or not using\nthe classification.\n1-57\n\n\f24th Annual Report to Congress\nThe regulations implementing the new developmental delay requirements (34 CFR \u00a7300.313) clarify the statutory language. First, the regulations stipulated that states may adopt the term \"developmental delay\" and determine whether it applies to children ages 3 through 9 or to a subset of that age range. The state also defines the term. The state may not require LEAs to use developmental delay, but any LEA that opts to use it must conform to both the state's definition of the term, as well keep within the state's age range. No LEA can use developmental delay absent the state's adoption of the term and establishment of a definition and applicable age range. Finally, the regulations state that the other 13 disability categories may continue to be used for children who fall within the state's prescribed developmental delay age range.\nThese changes to the statute and regulations raised a series of questions about the long-term implications of expanding the age range through age 9. To answer those questions, the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Environmental Health co-funded a project in August 1999 to examine the use of developmental delay through age 9 in states, identify issues affecting states' decisions, and consider options reflecting various ways developmental delay can be implemented above age 5. The project was to study whether the expanded age range would increase the\nnumber of children served under IDEA, thus leading to increased costs for\nproviding services or possible misidentification of children. The project was also to study whether developmental delay would simply be an alternate way of reporting students who would otherwise be eligible under one of the 13 disability categories under Part B or if children classified as developmentally delayed have a distinct set of characteristics separating them from any of the other 13 categories of disability. CDC's interest was based on its approach to serving children with developmental delays from an interdisciplinary approach that remediates skill deficits within the context of the family.\nThe study involved an in-depth survey of state practices on the use of the\ndevelopmental delay classification for preschool-aged children as well as for children ages 6 through 9. The appendix at the end of this module is a summary chart of developmental delay age ranges and classification criteria across states. Twenty states reported using developmental delay above age 5, while other states said they were considering expanding the age range above 5. Use of some or all of the 13 Part B disability categories in conjunction with developmental delay varies among states. In\nsome instances, states continue to use all 13 disability categories in addition to developmental delay, while other states subsume one or more Part B categories under the definition of developmental delay. There is also variation in the definition of developmental delay, including eligibility criteria. For example, some states use two standard deviations below the mean in one developmental area and/or one and a half standard deviations below the mean in two developmental areas, while other\n1-58\n8\n\n\fUse of the Developmental Delay Classification for Children Ages 3 Through 9\nstates use percent delay in one or two developmental areas ational Association of State Directors of Special Education, 2000). Sometimes other criteria in addition to quantitative scores are used to determine eligibility, such as diagnosed conditions, professional judgment, or informed clinical opinion (Danaher, 2001).\nOSEP was concerned that using developmental delay above age 5 could greatly expand the population of children served under IDEA. Public comments on the proposed regulations implementing the IDEA Amendments of 1997 revealed concern about local option to use developmental delay (Federal Register, 1999). In response to these issues, researchers conducted surveys and held focus groups with state Section 619 preschool coordinators, state directors of special education, and school psychologists. Only one fifth of state directors and school psychologists felt there would be significant increases in the number of children being served under IDEA; one third of both groups thought there would be little change, and one third of both groups felt there would be moderate increases (Simeonsson et al., 2001). Only 5% of the state Section 619 coordinators believed there would be a substantial increase in the number of children served (Simeonsson et al., 2001). Local option to use developmental delay did not appear to be a problem. Ninety-six percent of state directors responding to the survey reported that inconsistencies across LEAs do not exist because 95% or more of their LEAs elected to use developmental delay\n(Simeonsson et al., 2001).\nThe surveys and focus group results revealed other areas likely to be affected by the extension of developmental delay above age 5. Some of these areas included training and technical assistance, implementation and programming, family issues, identification and referral, funding mechanisms, assessments, and transition from\ndevelopmental delay to another Part B category or out of special education\n(Simeonsson et al., 2001).\nIn general, the research suggests a positive, child-oriented attitude about using developmental delay both for preschool-aged children as well as for children above age 5. Using developmental delay into the elementary school years was seen as a\nbenefit because it would:\nserve children earlier who would later be found eligible for special education, i.e., keep children from \"falling through the cracks\";\nkeep a functional and service focus on the child rather than deficit-oriented labels that tend to drive services;\nprovide more age appropriate assessments and eligibility determinations for the early elementary years when instruments for determining some specific disability categories are limited or nonexistent;\n1-59\n\n\f24th Annual Report to Congress\ncontinue to serve children who may not meet specific categorical criteria; and\nprovide a smoother transition from preschool into kindergarten or first grade (Simeonsson, 2001).\nSimeonsson et al. (2001) also provide philosophical underpinnings as guidance for states to consider as they study changes in state policy and service delivery systems. These considerations include the premise that developmental delay focuses on functional limitations of the whole child rather than characteristics specific to a Part B disability category. Services can be coordinated from a variety of sources and targeted to address a child's functional levels rather than providing a standard menu of services in response to the diagnostic label of a child. Using developmental delay through age 9 allows for continuity of services throughout the developmental years without a stigmatizing label that may be associated with a specific disability category. Finally, emphasis on functional needs, or a noncategorical approach, may help reduce later referrals to special education. Designing programs based on functional needs also aligns with CDC's interdisciplinary approach to treating the \"whole person\" (Simeonsson et al., 2001).\nSimeonsson et al. (2001) present options for states to consider during the decisionmaking process of whether to use developmental delay above age 5. First, a child eligible for special education under one of the 13 categories could be identified as developmentally delayed rather than assigned another, potentially more stigmatizing, disability category. Developmental delay would be the term used to describe any child with a disability but would not be a discrete additional category. Second, developmental delay could be a discrete category of disability used as a last resort, (i.e., when the child's assessed characteristics do not fit the eligibility requirements of any of the 13 existing categories). Third, developmental delay could be a discrete additional category based on functional limitations regardless of whether eligibility criteria under one of the existing 13 categories were met. A fourth option is a hybrid category so that developmental delay would not be a discrete category but would subsume any existing category or categories for which the criteria of functional limitations would be sufficient to determine eligibility. This option looks at multiple developmental domains that, taken individually, would be assigned to a specific disability category and eliminates the need to determine which disability should be the child's \"main\" disability for categorization and service delivery purposes. The final option is a noncategorical approach for all children with disabilities. This option focuses on functional limitations associated with characteristics needed for learning, regulation of behavior, communication, mobility, seeing and listening, use of limbs and extremities, literacy and numeracy ability, and daily living skills.\n1-60\n\n\fUse of the Developmental Delay Classification for Children Ages 3 Through 9\nChanges in Numbers of Children Served\nIn Table 1-5, Part B annual child count data collected by OSEP for school years 1999-2000 and 2000-01 show the change in use of developmental delay above age 5. The figures indicate that there has not been a substantial increase in the number of children served under Part B. In fact, the number of 6- through 9-year-old children served decreased from 1,730,414 in 1999-2000 to 1,710,389 in 2000-01. There was a small increase in children ages 6 through 9 categorized as developmentally delayed (from 19,304 to 28,935 students), which could reflect the fact that more states used developmental delay above age 5 in 2000-01 than in the previous year.\nState-reported data indicate a steady increase in the number of states expanding use of developmental delay above age 5. In 1999-2000, 18 states used developmental delay above age 5, but did not necessarily use it for the full 6-through-9 age range. By 2000-01, 20 states had expanded their age range above age 5, again not necessarily\nfor the entire 6-through-9 age range. Most of the children who are served as\ndevelopmentally delayed above age 5 are 6 years old.\nStates continue to study the option of using developmental delay for children with disabilities above age 5. Although half of the states have extended use of the classification to 6- through 9-year-olds, there has not been a surge in the numbers of children 6 through 9 served as developmentally delayed. Beginning at age 3, there is a steady decrease in the developmental delay classification as chronological age increases. During 2000-01, 33.4% of 3-year-olds were reported as developmentally delayed, compared to 29.8% of 4-year-olds, and 16.9% of 5-year-olds.\nUse of developmental delay continues in all but two states that adopted it. Nearly 25% of preschool-aged children with disabilities are categorized as developmentally delayed. Comparative data to show if this number is increasing are not yet available because 2000-01 was the first year that child count data for 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old children were reported by disability category. The options for using developmental delay in relation to the other 13 disability categories for preschoolers are similar to the recommendations set forth by Simeonsson et al. (2001). Danaher (2001) reports that some states use developmental delay for the age range to which it applies only after considering other disability categories. More than half of the states add developmental delay to the list of Part B categories (i.e., developmental delay is a\ndiscrete, 14th category).\n\n9\n\n1-61\n\n\fTable 1-5 Total Number of 6-, 7-, 8-, and 9-Year-Old Students With Disabilities and Number With Developmental\nDelay for School Years 1999-2000 and 2000-01\n\nAll 6-yearolds with disabilities\n\n6-year-olds with DD\n\nAll 7-yearolds with disabilities\n\n7-year-olds with DD\n\nAll 8-yearolds with disabilities\n\n8-year-olds with DD\n\nSchool year 1999-2000\n\n328,674\n\n10,021\n\n397,967\n\n5,153\n\n470,944\n\n3,103\n\nSchool year 2000-01\n\n331,439\n\n14,593\n\n393,828\n\n8,278\n\n463,958\n\n4,491\n\nSource: U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education Programs, Data Analysis System (DANS).\n\nAll 9-yearolds with disabilities\n532,830\n521,164\n\n9-year-olds with DD\n1,027\n1,573\n\n\fUse of the Developmental Delay Classification for Children Ages 3 Through 9\nSummary\nThe IDEA Amendments of 1997 extended the use of the term developmental delay for 6- through 9-year-olds at states' discretion. OSEP and the CDC commissioned a study of how states have used the term since the 1997 amendments. Twenty states reported using the developmental delay option for children over 5, while other states said they are considering doing so. State-reported data suggest that there has been no surge in the number of children reported to be receiving services under IDEA and that use of the developmental delay option steadily decreases as chronological age increases.\n\n93\n\n1-63\n\n\f241h Annual Report to Congress\nReferences\nCode of Federal Regulations, Title 34, Part 300.

STUDENT CHARACTERISTICS Infants and Toddlers Served Under IDEA\nPreschoolers Served Under IDEA Students Ages 6 Through 21 Served Under IDEA A Changing Population: Individual and Household Characteristics of High School Students With Disabilities\n108\n\n\fInfants and Toddlers Served Under IDEA\nThe Education of the Handicapped Act Amendments of 1986 established the Early Intervention Program for Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities under Part H (now Part C) of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The program assists states in developing and implementing a statewide, comprehensive, coordinated, multidisciplinary, interagency system that makes early intervention services available to all children with disabilities from birth through age 2. Full implementation of the program in all states and outlying areas was achieved by September 30, 1994 (U.S. Department of Education, 2000).\nThis module presents state-reported data about the number of infants and toddlers with disabilities receiving services in 2000-01 and the racial/ethnic distribution of this population. It also presents 1999-2000 data on the environments in which services were provided and the percentage of infants and toddlers served who transitioned to Part B services.\nThe Number of Children Served Under IDEA, Part C\nSince 1994, the number of infants and toddlers served under Part C has grown 40%, from 165,351 on December 1, 1994, to 230,853 on December 1, 2000 (see Table AA9 and Figure II-1). After excluding children from the outlying areas, these counts represent 1.4% of the 1994 birth through 2-year-old population and 2% of the 2000 birth through 2-year-old population (see Table AH1). The increase in the number of children receiving services remained steady from 1994 to 1997 but declined in 1998 before resuming its upward direction. Anecdotal reports from states have attributed the increase in the child count to improved Child Find efforts, more efficient data collection procedures, and staff training. Part of the decline in the 1998 Part C child\ncount may be accounted for by changes in the administrative data collection\nprocedures in Illinois and Ohio. In 1998, the lead agency and thus the responsibility for collecting and reporting Part C data in Illinois passed from the Department of\nEducation to the Department of Human Services. Such a change can lead to volatility in the data because different agencies may have different counting\nprocedures and priorities. In the case of Illinois, the change in lead agency resulted in a 31% drop in the number of infants and toddlers served, a decline of 2,403 children. Also in 1998, Ohio changed to a new data collection system it believes is more reliable and able to eliminate possible duplication in the child count that the state experienced in previous data collection years. This change resulted in a 77% drop in Ohio's infant and toddler count, a decline of 17,756 children.\n\n\f2e Annual Report to Congress\nFigure II-1 Number of Infants and Toddlers Served Under IDEA, Part C,\n1994 Through 2000\n\n250,000\n200,000 -\n165,351\n150,000 -\n\n177,286\n\n186,527\n\n196,337\n\n189,462\n\n206,111\n\n230,853\n\n100,000 -\n\n50,000 -\n\n1994\n\n1995\n\n1996\n\n1997\n\n1998\n\n1999\n\n2000\n\nYear\n\nSource: U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education Programs, Data Analysis System (DANS).\nBy 1999, the Illinois and Ohio transitions were complete, and the 10% increase appears to be an adjustment for the aberrant dip in the count for the previous year. The 12% increase in the child count from 1999 to 2000 was the largest 1-year increase since the Part C data collection was fully implemented in 1994. Most states and outlying areas contributed to this increase; however, some states' child count numbers rose at a higher rate than expected. Illinois' child count rose from 8,104 to 11,506, a 42% increase. Illinois attributed this large increase to continued improvements in Child Find efforts. West Virginia reported a 55% increase in its child count, from 833 in 1999 to 1,288 in 2000. The state reported that it was rebounding from difficulties experienced in converting from a database and paper transfer process to a newly created data application. Only seven states and two outlying areas reported a decrease in the number of infants and toddlers served under Part C in 2000. All other states and outlying areas reported increases in Part C child count.\n\nII-2 BEST COPY AVAILABLE\n\n110\n\n\fInfants and Toddlers Served Under IDEA\nIn the 2000 child count, 16% of the total number of children served under Part C were birth through 1 year old. Thirty-two percent of the children served were 1 through 2 years old, and 53% were between 2 and 3 years of age (see Table AH1). Since 1994, the distribution of discrete age groups in the child count has varied only slightly. From year to year, the birth through 1-year-old age group ranged between 16% and 18% of the total; the 1- through 2-year-old age group ranged between 32% and 33%, and the 2- through 3-year-old age group has ranged between 49% and 53% from 1994 to 2000.\nIn 2000, nine states and one outlying area reported serving at-risk infants and toddlers under Part C: California, Hawaii, Indiana, Massachusetts, Nevada, New\nHampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, West Virginia, and Guam. An at-risk child is defined as a child under age 3 who would be at risk of experiencing a substantial developmental delay if early intervention services were not provided. Of the states\nthat reported serving at-risk infants and toddlers in the 2000 child count, two\nreported more than half of their Part C population in the at-risk category: California reported 75% and Hawaii reported 54% of their Part C populations as at risk. New Mexico reported 37%, Indiana reported 14%, and North Carolina reported 13% of their Part C populations in this category. The remaining five states and one outlying area reported serving 4% or less of their child count in the at-risk category (see Tables AH1 and AH2).\nRace/Ethnicity of Infants and Toddlers Served\nThis section describes the racial/ethnic distribution of the children served under Part C in 2000. The collection of race/ethnicity data under IDEA began in 1998. Because New York has not yet submitted race/ethnicity data for 2000, and the data collection is still somewhat new, the figures reported here should be interpreted cautiously. According to the 2000 child count, 63% of the children served under Part C were classified as White (non-Hispanic); 17% were Hispanic; 16% were Black (nonHispanic); 4% were Asian/Pacific Islander; and 1% were American Indian/Alaska\nNative. There has been little change in the distribution of children served by race/ethnicity since these data were first collected in 1998. A comparison of the percentage of children served under Part C with the birth through 2 population of\nthe 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico is shown in Figure 11-2. The data from Summary File 1 of the 2000 Census indicates that 60% of the national birth through 2 population was White (non-Hispanic); 21% was Hispanic; 15% was\nBlack (non-Hispanic); 4% was Asian/Pacific Islander; and 1% was American\nIndian/Alaska Native (see Tables AF6 and AH7).1\nData from the 2000 Census are available from the U.S. Census Bureau web site at www.Census.gov.\nII-3\n\n\f24\" Annual Report to Congress\nFigure 11-2\nRace/Ethnicity: NationaW Versus Part C Percentages\n70\n62.7\n60 50\n\n20.9\n\n20\n\n16.0 14.5\n\n16.7\n\n10 1.1 0.9\n\n3.5 3.8\n\nA merican Indian / A laska\nNative\n\nA sian A merican/Pacitic\nIslander\n\nBlack (nonI lispanic)\n\nRace/Ethnicity\n\nI lispanic\n\nPart C 0 National birth through 2 population\n\nWhite (nonispanic)\n\na/\n\nData from 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.\n\nSource: U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education Programs, Data Analysis System (DANS).\n\nEarly Intervention Service Settings for Infants and Toddlers With Disabilities\n\nData are collected in seven early intervention service setting categories under Part C. The categories are: program designed for children with developmental delays or disabilities, program designed for typically developing children, home, hospital (inpatient), residential facility, service provider location, and other setting. Part C of\nIDEA mandates states to provide services in natural environments. Natural environments include home and community settings in which children without disabilities participate. During the 1999-2000 reporting period, states reported that 68% of all early intervention services took place in the home (see Table AH5), compared with 63% served in 1998-99 and 53% in 1995-96, before the 1997\nAmendments were enacted (see Figure 11-3).\n\n11-4\n\nBEST COPY AVA1LBLE\n\n11 2\n\n\fInfants and Toddlers Served Under IDEA\nFigure 11-3 Part C Settings, 1995 Through 1999\n\n80\n\n70 -\n60\ncip\ncu 50\nbi)\n40 -\na.)\nci\n30 -\n/0\n10\n0\n\n53.2 28.2\n10.4\n1995\n\n55.3 25.6 1/.4\n1996\n\n58.8\n20.6\n1/.4 1997\n\n62.6\n17.6 13.1\n1998\n\n68.4\n14.3\n9./ 1999\n\nYear\n-.0- I l ()me\n-a- Program designed for children with developmental delay or disabilities -- Service-provider location\n\nSource: U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education Programs, Data Analysis System (DANS).\n\nPrograms designed for children with developmental delay or disability were the second most reported service setting for infants and toddlers, accounting for 14% of the children served under Part C (see Table AH5). Use of this service-setting category continues to decline as states move to serve children in more natural environments. In 1995, 28% of infants and toddlers were served in this setting.\n\nThe third most reported service setting was the service-provider location, where 9% of Part C children were served in 1999 (see Table AH5). The percentage of children with disabilities served in this category has varied somewhat from year to year. In 1995, 10% of children were reported as receiving services in the service-provider location, compared with 13% in 1998.\n\nBEST COPY AVADUBLE\n\n11 3\n\n\f241 Annual Report to Congress\nAll states and outlying areas reported 1999-2000 settings data; however,\nMassachusetts reported serving infants and toddlers only in the home setting category. Although Massachusetts families enrolled in Part C receive services in a\nvariety of settings, the state reports that most services are provided in the home.\nTransition to Part B\nThe Part C exiting data were first collected in 1998. Because 1999-2000 was only the second year exiting data were collected, the data should be interpreted cautiously. The exiting categories for reporting children who have reached the maximum age for Part C services include: Part B eligible (65,149); not eligible for Part B, exit with referrals to other programs (12,340); not eligible for Part B, exit with no referrals (6,746); and Part B eligibility not determined (12,611). Among children who had reached the maximum age for Part C services, 67.3% exited Part C eligible for Part B services. This percentage is up slightly from 1998-99 (66.0%). Another 12.7% of children who reached the maximum age for Part C services in 1999-2000 exited Part C with referrals to other programs (see Table AH6).\nSummary\nIn 2000, the number of birth through 2-year-olds with disabilities served under Part C saw its largest 1-year increase since all states and outlying areas reported full implementation of Part C in 1994. States attribute the continued increase in child count to increased Child Find efforts, extensive staff training, improved data processing procedures, and improved data collection systems. Use of the home setting category continues to increase. During this second year of collecting exit data, states continued to report eligibility for Part B as the most common reason for exit.\n11-6\n11 4\n\n\fInfants and Toddlers Served Under IDEA\nReference\nU.S. Department of Education.

Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office.\n11-7\n\n\fPreschoolers Served Under IDEA\nIn 1975, Congress passed the Education for All Handicapped Children Act\n(P.L. 94-142) after determining that millions of children with disabilities were not receiving \"appropriate educational services which would enable them to have full equality of opportunity\" (IDEA Amendments of 1997, \u00a7601(c)(2)(B)). Although the 1975 law ensured the provision of a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to\nstudents with disabilities, it did not mandate services for preschoolers with\ndisabilities. Instead, children ages 3 through 5 with disabilities were served under an incentive grants program. The importance of the preschool years was reflected in the Education of the Handicapped Act (EHA) Amendments of 1986, when Congress amended Section 619 of the law to include a new Preschool Grants for Children with Disabilities Program (U.S. Department of Education, 2000). All states currently participate in the Section 619 program. In order to be eligible to receive funding under the program, states are required to make a free appropriate public education available to all children with disabilities, ages 3 through 5, residing in the state. States may also provide services, at the state's discretion, to 2-year-old children with disabilities who will turn 3 during the school year. States were required to serve all eligible preschoolers by the 1991-92 school year (U.S. Department of Education,\n2000).\nThis module presents state-reported data on preschoolers with disabilities for the 2000-01 school year, including the number of children served under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and their racial/ethnic composition. The module also includes disability category and educational environment data for preschoolers served under IDEA during the 1999-2000 school year.\nNumber of Preschoolers Receiving Special Education Services\nFor the 2000-01 school year, states reported serving 599,678 children ages 3 through 5 with disabilities under IDEA (see Table AA1), up from 589,134 in 1999-2000. This\nnumber represents an increase of 144,229 preschoolers or a 31.7% growth in children served since 1992-93 (see Figure 11-4). From 1992-93 to 2000-01, the\nnumber of 3-year-olds receiving services increased 44%; the number of 4-year-olds increased 37.6%, and the number of 5-year-olds receiving services increased 22.4%.\nPreschoolers served under IDEA accounted for 5% of the total population of\nchildren ages 3 through 5 living in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico (see Tables AA1 and AF3).'\n' Population data are provided from Summary File 1 of the 2000 Census, U.S. Census Bureau.\n11-9\n116\n\n\f2411' Annual Report to Congress\nFigure 11-4 Number of Preschoolers Receiving Services Under IDEA During the 1992-93,\n1996-97, and 2000-01 School Years\n\n700,000 600,000 500,000 400,000 300,000 200,000 100,000\n\nAge 5\no Age 4\nAge 3\n\n1992-93\n\n1996-97\nSchool Years\n\n2000-01\n\nSource: U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education Programs, Data Analysis System (DANS).\n\nComparing 1996-97 data with 2000-01 data shows a similar but less dramatic\nincrease: 13.6% for 3-year-olds, 7.8% for 4-year-olds, and 4.9% for 5-year-olds. The continuing child count increase seen within the youngest age group may in part reflect expanded Child Find outreach activities and states' success in transitioning children from Part C to Part B.\nDisability Categories of Preschool Children Served Under IDEA\nP.L. 94-142 mandated the collection of disability category data on all children with\ndisabilities, but collection of these data for children ages 3 through 5 was\ndiscontinued in the EHA Amendments of 1986. The IDEA Amendments of 1997 restored this requirement.

The 13 disability categories are specific learning disabilities, speech or language impairments, mental retardation, emotional disturbance, hearing impairments, orthopedic impairments, other health impairments, visual impairments, multiple disabilities, deaf-blindness,\nautism, traumatic brain injury, and developmental delay.\n\nAs shown in Table II-1, speech or language impairment was the most prevalent disability category, accounting for 55.2% of all preschoolers served in 2000-01. Developmental delay was the next most common disability category, accounting for 24.9% of preschoolers served (see Table AA7).\n\nThe distribution of disabilities among preschoolers varied by age. For example, developmental delay was more frequent among younger preschoolers, while speech or language impairment was more frequent among older preschoolers. These variations by age may in part reflect the reclassification of preschoolers with developmental delay as more specific disabilities become apparent. The percentages\n\n1 1\n\n\f24111 Annual Report to Congress\n\nof children reported in other disability categories remained relatively small and constant across the 3- through 5-year-old range.\nEducational Environments for Preschoolers With Disabilities\n\nIn 1998-99, the Federal data collection was revised to add separate categories for reporting the educational placements of preschoolers served under IDEA. The revised educational environments for preschoolers now include early childhood setting, early childhood special education setting, home, part-time early childhood/part-time early childhood special education setting, residential facility,\nseparate school, itinerant services outside the home (optional), and reverse\nmainstream (optional).\nDuring the 1999-2000 school year, 36.2% of preschoolers were served in early childhood settings, 34.0% in early childhood special education settings, and 12.9% in part-time early childhood/part-time early childhood special education settings (see Table AB1). Another 3.6% were served at home; 7.1% received itinerant services outside the home; 4.4% attended a separate school; 1.7% were served in a reverse\nmainstream setting; and 0.1% lived in a residential facility. These figures indicate that 60% of the preschoolers were served in environments specifically designed to serve children with disabilities, and 40% were served in typical early childhood settings or at home.2 Eleven states reported serving more than 50% of their preschoolers with disabilities in early childhood settings, and 17 states reported serving fewer than 25% of their preschoolers in such settings.\nEducational Environments by Race/Ethnicity\n\nTable 11-2 presents educational environment data by race/ethnicity for preschoolers served in 1999-2000. Early childhood settings were the most common placement for American Indian children (44.9%), White non-Hispanic children (36.9%), and Black non-Hispanic children (35.9%) (see Table AB9). In contrast, early childhood special education settings were the most frequently reported placement for Asian/Pacific Islander preschoolers (48.8%) and Hispanic preschoolers (40.5%). Across racial/ethnic groups, similar percentages of children were reported as being served in the home, in a residential facility, in a separate school, or in a reverse mainstream setting. When compared to other racial/ethnic groups, relatively fewer Asian/Pacific Islander children were served in part-time early childhood special education settings, and relatively fewer American Indian children were reported as receiving itinerant services outside the home.\nTexas and the District of Columbia did not report settings data for preschoolers served under IDEA.\n\n11-12\n\n4\n\n119\n\n\fPreschoolers Served Under IDEA\n\nTable 11-2\nPreschool Educational Environments by Race/Ethnicity, 1999-2000\n\nEducational environments Early childhood Early childhood special education Home Part-time early childhood/part-time early childhood special education Residential facility Separate school Itinerant service outside the home Reverse mainstream setting Total\n\nAmerican Indian 44.9 30.0 2.5\n15.2 0.3 2.6 3.4 1.1 100.0\n\nAsian/ Pacific Islander\n24.3 48.8\n4.0\n7.9 0.3 3.0 10.4 1.2 100.0\n\nBlack 35.9 33.4 2.7\n15.3 0.4 4.2 7.1 0.9 100.0\n\nHispanic 29.3 40.5 3.4\n\nWhite 36.9 33.1 3.9\n\n13.2 0.3 2.5 9.2 1.5 100.0\n\n12.1 0.4 3.6 8.0 2.0 100.0\n\nSource: U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education Programs, Data Analysis System (DANS).\n\nRace/Ethnicity of Preschoolers Served Under IDEA\n\nThe IDEA Amendments of 1997 require states to submit data on the race/ethnicity of students receiving special education and related services beginning with the 199899 school year. This section of the module describes the racial/ethnic distribution of preschoolers served in 2000-01 and the disability distribution within each racial/ethnic group. Because New York has not yet submitted race/ethnicity data for the 2000-01 school year, the data presented here are incomplete and should be interpreted accordingly.\n\nAppendix Table AF7 presents race/ethnicity data for the preschoolers served under Part B in 2000-01. As Figure 11-5 shows, White (non-Hispanic) preschoolers were overrepresented in the Part B population. Asian American/Pacific Islander and,\nespecially, Hispanic children were underrepresented among the preschoolers served\nunder IDEA. For American Indian/Alaska Native and Black (non-Hispanic)\npreschoolers, the Part B and general populations were roughly equal.\n\n120\n\n11-13\n\n\f24th Annual Report to Congress\nFigure 11-5\nRace/Ethnicity: Nationalw Versus Part B Percentages\n67.4\n\n20.0 15.4 14.8\n\nA merican Indian/Alaska\nNative\n\n3'8 2.1\n\n1\nA sian A merican/Pacific\nIslander\n\nBlack (nonH ispanic)\n\nRace/Ethnicity\n\nHispanic\n\nNational 3- through 5-year-old population 0 Part B\n\nWhite (nonl-lispanic)\n\na/\n\nData from 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.\n\nSource: U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education Programs, Data Analysis System\nPANS).\n\nDisability Distribution by Race/Ethnicity\n\nSpeech or language impairment was the most frequently reported disability category for all racial/ethnic groups with one exception: among American Indian/Alaska Native preschoolers, developmental delay was the most frequently reported category, accounting for nearly half of the children served under IDEA (see Table 11-3).\nAmong White, Hispanic, Black, and Asian/Pacific Islander preschoolers, developmental delay was the next largest disability category, but the proportion of Hispanic children reported in this category was smaller than that of other\nracial/ethnic groups (19.0% vs. 32.9% for Black children, 29.4% for Asian/Pacific\nIslanders, and 27.2% for White children).\n\nBEST COPY AVAILABLE\nII-14\n\n1 21\n\n\fPreschoolers Served Under IDEA\n\nTable 11-3\nDisability Distribution by Race/Ethnicity for Preschoolers Served\nin 2000-01\n\nSpecific disabilities Specific learning disabilities Speech or language impairments Mental retardation Emotional disturbance Multiple disabilities Hearing impairments Orthopedic impairments Other health impairments Visual impairments Autism Deaf-blindness Traumatic brain injury Developmental delay All Disabilities\n\nAmerican Indian/ Alaska Native\n3.3 39.4\n1.8 0.6 1.1 1.1 0.9 1.5 0.5 0.9 0.1 0.1 48.6 100.0\n\nAsian/ Pacific Islander\n3.5 42.6\n5.2 0.9 2.1 2.3 2.9 2.3 1.0 7.5 0.1 0.2 29.4 100.0\n\nBlack 3.1\n47.7 5.8 1.4 1.6 1.2 1.7 1.6 0.5 2.2 0.0 0.2\n32.9 100.0\n\nHispanic 6.4 56.3 5.2\n0.5 1.8 1.8 2.7 2.7 0.8 2.6 0.1 0.1 19.0 100.0\n\nWhite 2.3\n56.2 4.0 1.9 1.4 1.3 1.7 1.6 0.5 2.3 0.0 0.1\n27.2 100.0\n\nSource: U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education Programs, Data Analysis System (DANS).\n\nAmong Asian/Pacific Islander preschoolers, 7.5% were reported to have autism.

More than . 6% of Hispanic preschoolers were reported in the specific learning disabilities category, compared with between 3% to 4% of American Indian/Alaska Native,\nAsian/Pacific Islander, and Black children and 2.3% of White children. More than 5% of Asian/Pacific Islander, Black, and Hispanic preschoolers were reported as having mental retardation, compared with about 2% of American Indian/Alaska Native preschoolers and 4% of White preschoolers.\n\nSummary\n\nThe number of preschool children with disabilities served under IDEA increased in 2000-01, but at a slower rate than in previous years.

During this 25-year period, the number of students receiving services has grown to more than 5 million. This module describes the characteristics of students with\ndisabilities served during the 2000-01 school year and discusses changes in the number of students served, their distribution across disability categories, and their\ndistribution across age groups since 1991-92.\nStudents Served Under IDEA by Disability Category\nIn 2000-01, states and outlying areas reported serving 5,775,722 students ages 6 through 21 under IDEA. This represents an increase of 28.4% since the 1991-92 school year. Students ages 6 through 17 with disabilities made up 11.5% of the estimated student enrollment for grades prekindergarten through 12th grade (see Table AA13). This percentage is also comparable to previous years (11.4% in 1999-\n2000).1\nStates report disability data in 13 categories: specific learning disabilities, speech or language impairments, mental retardation, emotional disturbance, multiple disabilities, hearing impairments, orthopedic impairments, other health impairments, visual impairments, autism, deaf-blindness, traumatic brain injury, and developmental delay. The developmental delay category, introduced in 1997-98, is applicable only to children ages 3 through 9. Its use for students ages 6 through 9 is optional for states and local education agencies (LEAs). In 2000-01, 28 states, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and outlying areas used the developmental delay category to report data for 6- through 9-year-olds. Table 11-4 shows the distribution of students served under IDEA during school years 1991-92 and 2000-01 by disability category and shows the percent change in each category during that period (see Tables AA3 and AA9).\nEnrollment data are 2000-01 estimates from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). These estimates include students with and without disabilities.\n11-19\n\n\f24111 Annual Report to Congress\n\nTable 11-4\nNumber of Students Ages 6 Through 21 Served Under IDEA During 1991-92 and 2000-01\n\nDisability Specific learning disabilities Speech or language impairments Mental retardation Emotional disturbance Multiple disabilities Hearing impairments Orthopedic impairments Other health impairments Visual impairments Autism Deaf-blindness Traumatic brain injury Developmental delay All disabilities\n\n1991-92 2,247,004\n998,904 553,262 400,211 98,408 60,727 51,389 58,749 24,083\n5,415 1,427\n245\n4,499,824\n\n2000-01 2,887,217 1,093,808\n612,978 473,663 122,559 70,767 73,057 291,850 25,975 78,749\n1,320 14,844 28,935 5,775,722\n\nPercent change in number\n28.5 9.5 10.8 18.4\n24.5 16.5 42.2 396.8 7.9 1,354.3 -7.5 5,958.8 -28.4\n\nNote: Reporting in the autism and traumatic brain injury categories was optional in 1991-92 and required beginning in 1992-93.\nData from 1991-92 include children with disabilities served under the\nChapter 1 Handicapped program.\nSource: U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education Programs, Data Analysis System (DANS).\n\nFour disability categories (specific learning disabilities, speech or language impairments, mental retardation, and emotional disturbance) continued to account for the majority of students served under IDEA. The specific learning disabilities category represented half of all students served. Speech or language impairments\n(18.9%), mental retardation (10.6%), and emotional disturbance (8.2%) were the next largest categories. Together, these four categories represented 87.7% of all students ages 6 through 21 served under IDEA, down somewhat from the 93.3% of students served that these categories represented in 1991-92 (see Table AA9).\nOf the categories that now include 100,000 students or more, other health\nimpairments showed the largest increase between 1991-92 and 2000-01 (from 58,749\n\nII-20\n\nBESTCOPY AVAILABLE 1 26\n\n\fStudents Ages 6 Through 21 Served Under IDEA\nto 291,850). As a percentage of total students served, this category grew from 1% of the total in 1991-92 to 5% in 2000-01 (see Table AA9). Moreover, four states (Colorado, Delaware, Michigan, and Mississippi) report children with other health impairments under the orthopedic impairments category. If these four states did not combine these categories, it is likely that the growth in the other health impairments\ncategory would be even larger. One possible explanation for the growth in this\ncategory comes from the states, which have reported that the increase is due in large\npart to the increased identification and provision of services to children with\nattention deficit disorder and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nDevelopmental delay is another category that has experienced substantial growth. Since the category was introduced in 1997-98, the number of students reported in it has grown by 663%. The category grew 50.2% in the past year alone. And although autism accounts for a relatively small number of students served, reporting in this category has also increased dramatically in recent years, growing more than 400% since reporting in this category was first required in 1992-93 (see Table AA9).\nAge-Group Distribution\nBetween 1991-92 and 2000-01, the growth in the number of children served has varied by age group. The 12-through-17 age group showed the greatest growth. The number of students served in this age group increased 40.5% during that period. For the 18-through-21 age group, the increase during the same period was 20.1%, and for the 6-through-11 age group, it was 19.3% (see Table AA9).\nAmong all age groups, specific learning disabilities has continued to be the largest disability category. However, the rank order of the next largest categories differs by age group. For students ages 6 through 11, the second largest disability category was speech or language impairments, followed by mental retardation and emotional disturbance. For students in the 12-through-17 and 18-through-21 age groups, the speech or language impairments category was ranked fifth and sixth in size, respectively. For these age groups, mental retardation and emotional disturbance were the second and third largest disability categories after specific learning disabilities (see Table AA9).\nRace/Ethnicity\nThe IDEA Amendments of 1997 require that states report the race/ethnicity of children who receive special education and related services. States report race/ethnicity data in five categories: American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Pacific\n\n127\n\n11-21\n\n\f24\"' Annual Report to Congress\n\nTable 11-5\nPercentage of Students Ages 6 Through 21 Served Under IDEA by Disability and Race/Ethnicity, During the 2000-01 School Year\n\nDisability\nSpecific learning disabilities Speech or language impairments Mental retardation Emotional disturbance Multiple disabilities Hearing impairments Orthopedic impairments Other health impairments Visual impairments Autism Deaf-blindness Traumatic brain injury Developmental delay All disabilities\n\nAmerican Indian/ Alaska Native\n\nAsian/ Pacific Islander\n\n56.3\n\n43.2\n\n17.1\n\n25.2\n\n8.5\n\n10.1\n\n7.5\n\n5.3\n\n2.5\n\n2.3\n\n1.1\n\n2.9\n\n0.8\n\n2.0\n\n4.1\n0.4 0.6 0.0 0.3 0.7 100.0\n\n3.9 0.8 3.4 0.0 0.3 0.6 100.0\n\nBlack (nonHispanic)\n45.2\n15.1 18.9 10.7 1.9 1.0 0.9\n3.7 0.4 1.2 0.0 0.2 0.7 100.0\n\nHispanic\n60.3\n17.3 8.6 4.5 1.8 1.5 1.4\n2.8 0.5 0.9 0.0 0.2 0.2 100.0\n\nWhite (nonHispanic)\n48.9\n20.8 9.3 8.0 1.8 1.2 1.4\n5.9 0.5 1.4 0.0 0.3 0.6 100.0\n\nAll students served\n50.0\n18.9 10.6 8.2 2.1 1.2 1.3\n5.1\n0.4 1.4 0.0 0.3 0.5 100.0\n\nNote: Does not include data for New York State.\nSource: U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education Programs, Data Analysis System (DANS).\n\nIslander, Black (non-Hispanic), Hispanic, and White (non-Hispanic). This section of the module examines the racial/ethnic composition of the IDEA 6 through 21\npopulation. For each racial/ethnic group, it examines the distribution across disability categories and compares these results with the distribution of all students with disabilities. However, it should be remembered that this is only the third year that race/ethnicity data have been reported and that the reporting of these data continues to be a problem for states. Table 11-5 shows the percentage of students\nserved by race/ethnicity and disability during the 2000-01 school year.'\n2 New York's data are not included in the data presented in Table 11-2. New York has not yet provided race/ethnicity data for 2000-01.\n11-22\n128\n\n\fStudents Ages 6 Through 21 Served Under IDEA\nThe 2000-01 racial/ethnic make up of students ages 6 through 21 served under IDEA is similar to that reported for 1999-2000. White students made up 62.3% of the students served; 19.8% of students served were Black; 14.5% were Hispanic; 1.9% were Asian/Pacific Islander; and 1.5% were American Indian/Alaska Native (see Table AA15). The 2000 Census allowed respondents to report themselves in multiple racial/ethnic categories. IDEA, however, uses five mutually exclusive racial/ethnic categories. Using data from Summary File 1 of 2000 Census, we estimate that 62.9% of all children ages 6 through 21 would be considered White (non-Hispanic), using the IDEA race/ethnicity categories; 14.8% would be considered Black (non-Hispanic); 17.5% would be considered Hispanic; 3.8% would be considered Asian/Pacific Islander; and 1% would be considered American\nIndian/Alaska Native (see Table AF8).\nTable 11-5 presents the distribution of each racial/ethnic group across the 13\ndisability categories. As shown in that table, specific learning disabilities was the most frequent disability category for all racial/ethnic groups. In fact, with one exception, the rank order of the five largest disability categories is the same for all groups: specific learning disabilities, speech or language impairments, mental retardation, emotional disturbance, and other health impairments. The exception is that the order of mental retardation and speech or language impairments is reversed for Blacks (see\nTable AA15).\nWhen compared with the average percentages for all students with disabilities, the percentages of Black students receiving services for mental retardation or emotional disturbance were higher, and the percentages receiving services for specific learning disabilities or speech/language impairments were lower. Among Hispanic students, the percentage receiving services for specific learning disabilities was higher than that for all students with disabilities, and the percentages receiving services for emotional disturbance, other health impairments, or mental retardation were lower. The\npercentages of Asian/Pacific Islander students receiving services for speech/ language impairments or autism were higher than those for all students with\ndisabilities, and the percentages receiving services for specific learning disabilities or\nemotional disturbance were lower. As is the case for Hispanic students, the\npercentage of American Indian/Alaska Native students receiving services for specific learning disabilities was higher than that for all students with disabilities, and the percentage receiving services for mental retardation was lower. The percentages of\nWhite students in most disability categories were all close to those for the IDEA student population as a whole, but the percentages of White students in the other\nhealth impairments category was higher.\n\n2\n\n11-23\n\n\f24th Annual Report to Congress\nS ummary\nThe number of students ages 6 to 21 with disabilities served under IDEA has continued to grow at a steady rate, rising 28.4% since 1991-92. During this time\nperiod, four disability categories have accounted for the majority of students served: specific learning disabilities, speech or language impairments, mental retardation, and\nemotional disturbance. The other health impairments category experienced\nsubstantial growth in both the number of children served and as a percentage of all children with disabilities. Developmental delay and autism, although small categories in terms of the percentages of children served, have also experienced large growth during the same period.\nIn 2000-01, the rank ordering of the top five disability categories was nearly identical for all racial/ethnic groups; however, students from some racial/ethnic groups were overrepresented or underrepresented in specific disability categories when compared with the IDEA student population as a whole. For example, the percentages of White children receiving services for other health impairments, American Indian/\nAlaska Native and Hispanic children receiving services for specific learning disabilities, the percentage of Asian/Pacific Islander children receiving services for speech or language impairments, and the percentage of Black children receiving services for mental retardation were somewhat higher than the percentages for all students served under IDEA. Conversely, the percentages of Asian/Pacific Islander and Hispanic children receiving services for emotional disturbance and the\npercentage of Hispanic children receiving services for other health impairments were lower than the percentages observed for all IDEA students. Race/ethnicity data should still be viewed with caution, however.\n11-24\n3 0\n\n\fA Changing Population: Individual and Household Characteristics of High School Students With Disabilities\n\nThe composition of the student population in America's schools has changed dramatically in recent decades. For example, there has been a marked increase in\nthe diversity of students' racial/cultural and language backgrounds. The population of students with disabilities clearly reflects such demographic changes (see Table II8). The population of students with disabilities also reflects changes in the numbers of children identified in particular disability categories (such as specific learning\ndisabilities or other health impairments) over time (see Table 11-6).\n\nTwo studies sponsored by the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) provide a unique opportunity to identify the nature and extent of such changes among students receiving special education services in secondary school. The\nNational Longitudinal Transition Study (NLTS), conducted from 1987 through 1993,\nexamined the characteristics, experiences, and achievements of a nationally\nrepresentative sample of secondary school students receiving special education as\nthey transitioned into early adulthood. As the first source of nationally representative data on students with disabilities, NLTS prompted OSEP to launch an extensive program of longitudinal research that includes children and youth from birth to young adulthood. As part of that research program, the National Longitudinal\nTransition Study-2 (NLTS2) was commissioned in 2000. This study, which is\nmodeled on NLTS, will follow secondary-school-age students through their mid-20s, collecting data on secondary school and postschool experiences. The two studies\nwere designed so that valid comparisons can be made between students who\nreceived special education in the late 1980s and students receiving special education\nin the early years of the 21st century.\n\nInformation now is available from the first wave of interviews with parents of\nNLTS2 students, conducted in the spring and summer of 2001. This information can be compared with data from similar interviews of parents conducted in 1987 for the age groups of students included in Wave 1 of both studies: 15-, 16-, and 17-yearolds.' A series of reports over the next few years will examine changes in many aspects of student characteristics and their experiences in high school. Later waves of\ndata also will be compared to illuminate differences in the postsecondary\nachievements of young people with disabilities.\nThe samples were weighted to have the same distribution of these three age groups: 26% are 15, 35% are 16, and 38% are 17.\n\n1 31\n\n11-25\n\n\fTable 11-6 Disability Category Distribution of Youth With Disabilities, 1987 and 2000\n\nPrimary disability category Learning disability Speech/language impairment Mental retardation Emotional disturbance\nHearing impairment Visual impairment Orthopedic impairment Other health impairment Multiple disabilities Deaf-blindnessil\nAutism 12/\nTraumatic brain injurylil All disabilities\n\nFederal child count (ages 12 through 17)\n\nCohort 1\n\nCohort 2\n\nNumber\n1,014,618 104,968 292,746 196,153 17,377 7,905 16,208 19,572 23,631 252 NA NA\n1,693,430\n\nPercentage 59.9 6.2 17.3 11.6\n1.0 .5 1.0 1.2 1.4 .0\n\nNumber\n1,649,306 129,683 312,133 286,909 32,723 11,865 31,032 142,853 52,074 518 22,289 7,711\n2,679,096\n\nPercentage 61.6 4.8 11.7 10.7\n1.2 .4 1.2 5.3 1.9 .0 .8 .3\n\nPercentage point change\n+1.7 -1.4 -5.6 -.9 +.2 -.0 +.2 +4.2 +.5 +.0 +.8 +.3\n\nNLTS/NLTS2 (ages 15 through 17)\n\nCohort 1 60.4\n\nCohort 2 61.4\n\nPercentage point change\n+1.0\n\n4.4\n\n3.2\n\n-1.2\n\n18.0\n\n13.0\n\n-5.0\n\n11.4\n\n11.9\n\n+.5\n\n1.4\n\n1.4\n\n.0\n\n.6\n\n.6\n\n.0\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n+.2\n\n1.4\n\n5.21\n\n+3.8\n\n1.3b\n\n2.2 b\n\n+.9\n\na/ Includes students with deaf-blindness.\n\nb/\n\nStudents with autism and traumatic brain injury have included in this other health impairments category.\n\nbeen\n\nreassigned,\n\nfor\n\ncomparison\n\npurposes,\n\nto\n\nother\n\ncategories\n\nas\n\ndesciibed\n\nin\n\nthis\n\ntext,\n\nwith\n\nmany\n\nbeing\n\n\fA Changing Population: Individual and Household Characteristics of High School Students With Disabilities\nIn this module, an initial comparison of students represented by NLTS and NLTS2 (referred to as Cohorts 1 and 2) focuses on changes in students and their households between 1987 and 2001, including aspects of students' disability profiles and student and household demographic characteristics. Findings are presented for secondary school students receiving special education as a whole and for the nine disability categories that were in use in both 1987 and 2001. The module includes comparisons with the general population where comparable data are available.\nStudents' Disability Profiles\nThis section of the module highlights changes in key aspects of students' disability profiles, including their primary disability classification and the ages at which their disabilities were first identified and when they first received disability-related services.\nPrimly Disabili07 Classification\nUsing Federal child count data, Table 11-6 depicts the considerable growth in the\nnumber of adolescents receiving special education, as well as changes in the\ndistribution of disability categories between 1987 (Cohort 1) and 2000 (Cohort 2). Although there has been a 58% increase in the number of students ages 12 through 17 who receive special education, the more important point for comparing the two cohorts is the different mix of disabilities at the two time points. Most notably, in 1990, Public Law 101-476 added two new disability categoriesautism and traumatic brain injury (TBI) to the Education of All Handicapped Children Act. Students with those conditions previously had been distributed among other categories, with the heaviest concentration in the other health impairments category. Despite the removal of students with autism and TBI, the other health impairments category still has shown more than a fourfold increase. It comprised only slightly more than 1% of students with disabilities in this age range in 1987 but more than 5% in 2000. This change reflects, in part, the increase in the number of students diagnosed with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as a primary disability, who may be reported in the other health impairments category. A decline of similar size was evident for students with mental retardation (17% to 12%).\nSmaller changes were evident in some other categories. The number of students with learning disabilities grew by less than 2 percentage points, and declines of about 1 to 2 percentage points were noted for students with speech/language impairments and emotional disturbance. Other changes were less than 1 percentage point. Overall, the distributions of primary disability classifications of the NLTS and NLTS2 samples of 15- to 17-year-olds match the 1987 and 2000 national distribution of 12- to 17-yearolds quite closely.\nII-27\n133\n\n\f24th Annual Report to Congress\nThe small shifts in disability distribution between the two time points should be kept\nin mind when considering the findings regarding changes in the population of\nstudents with disabilities as a wholethe characteristics and experiences of Cohort 2 reflect students with learning disabilities and other health impairments more than was true for Cohort 1.\nAge at First Identffication of and Service for Disabil,\nThe age at which children first are recognized as having a disability can suggest much about the nature of their disabilities and the experiences children and families have with them. Some disabilities, such as genetic disorders and some conditions that result from premature birth, affect children throughout their lifetimes; these children and their families never experience a time when disability is not an aspect of their\nrelationship. Other disabilities emerge when children reach the ages of typical developmental milestones and exhibit delays in acquiring skills such as walking or talking. Still others become apparent when children take on more sophisticated cognitive tasks, such as reading or mathematics, and demonstrate difficulty in\nlearning. Other disabilities can result from accidents that occur at any age. Regardless of the age at which disabilities emerge, promptness in identifying and addressing\nthem can be extremely important in ameliorating their effects on children's development and functioning. IDEA includes an early intervention program for infants and toddlers with disabilities that begins at birth and has outreach\ncomponents for their families.\nTable 11-7 indicates that high-school-age students with disabilities in 2001 were first identified as having a disability or delay significantly earlier than were their peers in 1987.1 The average age at first identification reported by parents dropped by about 8 months, from 6.6 years for Cohort 1 to 5.9 years for Cohort 2. Higher proportions of youth in Cohort 2 first were identified as infants and toddlers (19% vs. 16.5%) and as preschoolers (10% vs. 6%), significantly so in the latter case. Receipt of disability-related services also began significantly earlier for Cohort 2; the average age of first service was 7.4 years for Cohort 2, compared with 8.5 years for Cohort 1.\nFor this and subsequent tables, significance levels are calculated using the standard errors presented in each table. Standard errors have a 25% \"cushion\" in order to minimize the possibility that a difference between two estimates meets the standard for statistical significance by chance alone.\n11-28\n134\n\n\fA Changing Population: Individual and Household Characteristics of High School Students With Disabilities\n\nTable 11-7\nChanges in Age at First Identification of and Service for Disability, by Cohort\n\nPercentage whose disability or delay first was identified at age:\nBirth through 2 3 or 4 5 or 6 7 through 10 11 or older\nAverage age when disability or delay first was identified\nPercentage who began receiving service for a disability or delay at age:\nBirth to 2 3 or 4 5 or 6 7 through 10 11 or older\nAverage age when first began receiving service for a disability or delay\nSample size\n\nCohort 1\n16.5 (1.7) 5.5 (1.1)\n27.0 (2.1) 37.2 (2.3) 13.7 (1.6)\n6.6 (.2)\n4.3 (1.0) 5.6 (1.1) 18.3 (1.8) 44.4 (2.3) 27.3 (2.1)\n8.5 (.2) 2,729\n\nCohort 2\n19.0 (1.6) 9.5 (1.2) 31.3 (1.9) 29.6 (1.9) 10.6 (1.8)\n5.9 (.1)\n9.1 (1.2) 7.9 (1.1) 21.5 (1.7) 42.8 (2.0) 18.8 (1.6)\n7.4 (.1) 5,665\n\nChange\n+2.5 +4.0* +4.3 -3.1\n+2.3 +3.2 -1.6\n\nNotes: Source:\n\nStandard errors are in parentheses.

Gender\nand racial/ethnic background are two other individual characteristics that have pervasive influences on adolescents' perspectives, preferences, and experiences.\n\n11-29\n135\n\n\f24th Annual Report to Congress\nTable 11-8 compares the gender and racial/ethnic distributions' of students in 1987 and 2001.\nThere was no significant change over time in the gender distribution of students with disabilities (69% and 67% male); at both time periods, males were significantly overrepresented among students receiving special education relative to students in the general population. Interestingly, a similar overrepresentation of males was evident even among infants and toddlers with disabilities (61%; Hebbeler et al., 2001).\nThe increase in the racial/ethnic diversity of the general student population is also evident among students with disabilities. Hispanic students exhibited the largest increase for both groups, being half again as large in 2001 as in 1987 (14% vs. 9%, p<.05). In contrast, the proportions of students with disabilities who were White or Black declined by just over 2 percentage points. With these changes, the population of high school students receiving special education in 2001 more closely mirrored the racial/ethnic distribution of the general population than had been true in 1987.\nConsistent with the increase in the Hispanic population, there was more than a fourfold increase in the proportion of students with disabilities who did not use primarily English at home: the percentage grew from 3% to 14%. Thus, students\nwith disabilities increasingly faced the challenges of communicating in two languages\nand accommodating two cultures, in addition to the challenges posed by their\ndisabilities.\nCharacteristics of Students' Households\nA student's household is his or her first educational setting. At home, children form their first emotional attachments, achieve early developmental milestones, and develop a foundation for subsequent growth and learning. As children grow up, what they need from family and others who share their households may change, but values, expectations, and preferences continue to be shaped by experiences at home.\n2 The racial/ethnic classification of students in Cohort 1 relied on information supplied by parents. In Cohort 2, information came primarily from the school districts or state-supported special schools from which students were sampled. In cases in which schools or districts did not supply this information, parent reports of racial/ethnic classifications were used.\n11-30\n136\n\n\fTable 11-8\nChanges in the Gender and Racial/Ethnic Distributions of Students With Disabilities and Students in the General\nPopulation\n\nIndividual characteristics\nPercentage male\nPercentage who were: White Black\nHispanic Asian/Pacific Islander American Indian/Alaska Native Mixed/other Percentage who did not use English at home\nSample size\n\nYouth with disabilities\n\nCohort 1 68.6 (2.0)\n\nCohort 2 67.4 (1.9)\n\nPercentage point change\n-1.2\n\n64.9 (2.1) 23.5 (1.8)\n8.7 (1.2) 1.4 (.5)\n.6 (.3) .8 (.3)\n3.3 (.8) 2,988\n\n62.5 (1.9) 20.7 (1.6) 13.6 (1.3)\n1.3 (.4) 1.4 (.5) .6 (.2)\n14.2 (1.4) 6,002\n\n-2.4 -2.8\n+4.9**\n-.1\n+.8 -.2\n+10.9'1**\n\nYouth in the general population\n\nCohort la/\n50.0\n\nCohort 2h/ 51.0\n\nPercentage point change\n+1.0\n\n68.8\n\n63.1\n\n-5.7\n\n16.4\n\n16.1\n\n-.3\n\n10.8\n\n15.7\n\n+4.9\n\n3.9\n\n5.1\n\n+1.2\n\n3.5\n\n5.0\n\n+2.5\n\na/ Figures are for 5- through 17-year-olds.

Small declines were noted in the proportion of youth with disabilities who were living in group settings other than families. The declines in these living arrangements were offset by an increase of almost 4 percentage points in youth living with friends or family members other than parents.\nHousehold Composition\nThe percentage of young people living in single-parent households was relatively stable over time for both youth with disabilities and those in the general population. However, the 4- to 6-percentage-point increase in youth with disabilities who were living in two-parent households with only their biological mother or father suggests that two-parent households increasingly included stepparents. The percentage of youth with disabilities who were living with neither biological parent declined by almost 6 percentage points, consistent with the decline in youth living in group settings other than households. This decline contrasts with a doubling of students living in households with no biological parents in the general population. Nonetheless, the rate at which young people with disabilities lived in households with no biological parents (e.g., with foster or adoptive parents) was more than twice that of students in the general population in 2001.\nThe average number of children in the households of youth with disabilities dropped\nslightly over time from 2.6 to 2.3 children, and the percentage of students in households with another child with a disability increased by almost 5 percentage\npoints, although this change was not large enough to be statistically significant.\nHead of Ho usehold Education and Employment\nTable II-10 demonstrates a marked improvement in the education and employment status of heads of households among both youth with disabilities and youth in the\nII-32\n138\n\n\fTable 11-9\nChanges in Household Composition of Youth With Disabilities and Youth in the General Population\n\nIndividual characteristics Percentage of youth living:\nWith a parent or guardian With another family member or friend In a residential school In a supervised group home In an institution In another arrangement\nPercentage living in a single-parent household\n\nYouth with disabilities\n\nCohort 1\n\nCohort 2\n\nPercentage point change\n\n94.0 (1.0) 2.2 (.6) .6 (.3) .7 (.4) 1.0 (.4) 1.6 (.7)\n35.8 (2.2)\n\n92.8 (1.0) 5.8 (.9) .1 (.1) .2 (.2) .4 (.2) .7 (.4)\n37.2 (1.9)\n\n-1.2\n+3.6***\n-.5 -.5 -.6 -.9\n+1.4\n\nPercentage of households with: No biological parents present Biological father present Biological mother present Both biological parents present\nAverage number of children in the household\n\n19.0 (1.8) 3.8 (.9) 34.8 (2.2) 42.4 (2.2)\n2.6 (.1)\n\n13.5 (1.3) 7.8 (1.0) 41.2 (1.9) 37.6 (1.9)\n2.3 (.1)\n\n-5.5* +4.0** +6.4* -4.8\n-.3*\n\nPercentage with another child/other children\n\nwith disabilities\n\n21.5 (1.9)\n\n26.1 (1.8)\n\n+4.6\n\nSample size\n\n2,890\n\n5,747\n\na/ Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics, 2001.\n13/ U.S. Census Bureau, 1987.

Income data are not adjusted for inflation.\n\nSource: NLTS2.\n\n\fA Changing Population: Individual and Household Characteristics of High School Students With Disabilities\ngeneral population. For example, the percentage of youth with disabilities living in households whose head was not a high school graduate dropped by about half (from 41% to 22%), which greatly exceeded the decline in the general population (from 22% to 13%). There were corresponding increases at every other education level for heads of households of students with disabilities. However, the average education\nlevel of heads of households in which youth with disabilities lived remained\nsubstantially below that of youth in the general population.\nThe strong economy through the late 1990s and early 21st century was reflected in the higher employment rates of heads of households of both youth with disabilities and youth in the general population. Unemployment among heads of households of young people with disabilities dropped by almost 11 percentage points, and full-time employment rose by a similar amount. Improvements in employment and other financial indicators also may have been affected by the changing demographics of the student population.\nHigher employment clearly contributed to increases in income over time. Because income data are not adjusted for inflation, a sizable increase in income would be expected because of inflation alone, whether or not gains in real income occurred. However, income gains for households of youth with disabilities were much larger than for those of students in the general population. Although youth with disabilities were substantially more likely than students in the general population to be living in households with incomes below $25,000, that group had declined by almost 33 percentage points by 2001, compared with a 19 percentage point decline in the general population. At the same time, the proportion of students with disabilities living in households with incomes of more than $50,000 increased by 30 percentage points, similar to the increase among students in the general population. However, students with disabilities continued to have significantly lower household incomes than did students in the general population.\nBoth higher incomes and welfare reform probably contributed to the reduced rates of participation in Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) (renamed\nTemporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) in 1996) and food stamps of almost 4 and 11 percentage points, respectively. The decline in AFDC/TANF was mirrored in the general population of students, although they did not experience a\ndecline in food stamp participation similar to students with disabilities.\n11-35\n142\n\n\f241! Annual Report to Congress\nDifferences in Rates of Change Between Disability Categories'\nThe kinds of changes in the population of high school students receiving special education described thus far did not affect all categories of students similarly. Students in some disability categories experienced a greater degree of change than was evident for students overall, whereas change was less marked for students in other categories. The most notable differences in the rates of change between\ndisability categories are highlighted here.\nStudents'DisabilityProhles\nThe decline in the average age at first identification of a disability that was noted for students with disabilities as a whole resulted from statistically significant reductions\nin age for students in four disability categorieslearning disabilities, emotional disturbance, and orthopedic and other health impairmentsranging from almost 10\nto 18 months (Table II-11). For students in other categories, there was no significant change in age at first identification. The overall drop in age at first service for disability of almost a full year that was seen in the population as a whole was more widely shared across the disability categories. Significant declines of 1 to 2 years in age at first service were evident for students in all categories except students with hearing impairments.\nIn general, the smallest reductions in age at first identification and first service were\nevident in categories for which the ages already were among the lowest of the\ndisability categories. For example, there was essentially no change in the average age\nof identification for students with hearing or visual impairments or multiple disabilities, for whom the average age was already 2 or younger. Similarly, the\nsmallest change in the age at first service was for students with hearing impairments,\n\nIn comparing the disability categories, it is important to understand the adjustments made in this analysis to improve the comparability of the two cohorts:\nThe two Cohort 1 categories of deaf and hard of hearing were combined to be comparable to the single Cohort 2 category of hearing impairment.\nIn both cohorts, students with deaf-blindness were included in the multiple impairments\ncategory.\nCohort 2 students with autism or TBI were included in other categories, using descriptions of the primary disability provided by parents. If parents said the primary disability of these students was autism or TBI, with no other information provided, students were included in the other health impairments category. If more than one disability, in addition to autism or TBI, was mentioned by parents, students were included in the multiple impairments category. A few students with autism or TBI were included in other categories on the basis of parents' reports. This distribution mirrors the fairly broad dispersion of students with autism and TBI in Cohort 1.\n\nII-36\n\n142\n\n\fTable II-11 Changes in Disability Profiles of Youth With Disabilities, by Cohort and Disability Category\n\nAverage age when disability was identified\nCohort 1 Cohort 2\nChange in average age\nAverage age when first received service for a disability\nCohort 1 Cohort 2\nChange in average age\nAverage self-care skills score Cohort 1 Cohort 2 Change in scale score\nAverage functional mental skills scale score\nCohort 1 Cohort 2 Change in scale score\n\nLearning disability\n\nSpeech/ language impairment\n\nMental retardation\n\nEmotional disturbance\n\nHearing impairment\n\n7.3 (.2)\n6.5 (.2)\n-.8\"\n\n5.9 (.4) 5.8 (.2) -.1\n\n4.8 (.3) 4.1 (.2) -.7\n\n7.4 (.3) 6.5 (.2)\n-.9*\n\n2.2 (.2) 2.5 (.2) +.3\n\n9.0 (.2) 8.0 (.2)\n-1.0*\"\n11.9 (.0) 11.7 (.0)\n-.2*\n\n8.4 (.3) 7.4 (.2)\n4.0**\n11.8 (.1) 11.7 (.1)\n-.1\n\n6.8 (.3)\n5.7 (.2)\n-1.1\"\n\n9.5 (.3)\n8.5 (.2)\n4.0**\n\n11.00 (.2) 10.7 (.1)\n-.3\n\n11.9 (.1) 11.7 (.0)\n-.2*\n\n4.6 (.3) 4.1 (.2) -.5\n11.8 (.0) 11.6 (.1)\n-.2*\n\n14.6 (.1) 14.1 (.1)\n_.5***\n\n14.5 (.2) 14.4 (.1)\n-.1\n\n12.0 (.3) 11.3 (.2) +.7\n\n(.2) 14.5 (.1)\n+.2\n\n14.2 (.2) 14.2 (.2)\n.0\n\nAverage household responsibilities scale score\nCohort 1\nCohort 2\nChange in scale score Sample size: Cohort 1/2\n\n10.6 (.2)\n9.6 (.2) -1.0***\n342/590\n\n10.7 (.3)\n9.8 (.2)\n-.9* 188/423\n\n9.6 (.2)\n10.5 (.2)\n+.9** 280/552\n\n9.9 (.2)\n10.1 (.2) +.2 258/523\n\n10.9 (.2)\n9.2 (.2)\n-1.7*\"\n604/585\n\nStandard errors are in parentheses.

One exception was the average age at identification for students with speech/language impairments, which did not decline; on average, students in both cohorts first were identified as having a speech/language disability or delay at school entry age.\nStudents' Demographic Characteristics\nThe fairly stable gender distribution that was noted for students with disabilities as a whole also was evident for most disability categories. Only among students with other health impairments was there a significant change, with the proportion of males in that category increasing from 54% in Cohort 1 to 75% in Cohort 2. This change resulted primarily from the considerable increases in the number of students\nwith autism and ADHD, most of whom were included in the other health impairments category for comparison purposes. Students with autism had the\nhighest proportion of males of any disability category.\nTable 11-12 shows that changes in the racial/ethnic distribution that were observed for students with disabilities as a whole affected students in different disability categories quite differently. For example, the small decline in the proportion of students as a whole who were White was evident for six of the nine disability categories. In contrast, there were increases of 13 and 20 percentage points in the proportion of White students among youth with speech/language and other health impairments, respectively. The small overall decline in the percentage of students with disabilities who were Black occurred for eight of the nine disability categories, with the decline of 11 percentage points among students with speech/language impairments being the largest. Only students with mental retardation showed an increase, which did not attain statistical significance.\nIncreases in the Hispanic population were evident in eight of nine disability categories, with the largest apparent among students with learning disabilities or visual impairments. For those students, the proportion of students who were\nHispanic increased 7 and 8 percentage points. In contrast, there was a 17 percentage point decrease in the percentage of Hispanic students among those with other health impairments, consistent with the large increase in White students in that group.\nIn seven disability categories, there were increases in the percentage of students who did not use primarily English at home, ranging from 7 to 22 percentage points. Many of these increases were consistent with increases in the proportion of Hispanic\nstudents. However, the largest increase was among students with hearing\nimpairments, which reflected a growth in reporting of the use of signed\n\n11-38\n\n144\n\n\fTable 11-12\nChanges in Racial/Ethnic Backgrounds and Language Use, by Cohort and Disability Category\n\nPercentage who were: White Cohort 1 Cohort 2\nPercentage point change\nBlack Cohort 1 Cohort 2\nPercentage point change\nHispanic Cohort 1 Cohort 2\nPercentage point change Percentage who do not use English at home\nCohort 1 Cohort 2\nPercentage point change Sample size: Cohort 1/2\n\nLearning disability\n67.0 (3.1) 62.5 (2.9) -4.5\n21.2 (2.7) 18.4 (2.3) -2.8\n8.7 (1.9) 15.4 (2.2)\n+6.7*\n13.0 (.8) 15.4 (2.2) +14.1***\n383/630\n\nSpeech/ language impairment\n53.8 (4.4) 66.5 (3.1) +12.7*\n27.4 (3.9) 16.8 (2.5) -10.6*\n15.7 (3.2) 14.3 (2.3) +1.4\n7.6 (2.4) 17.6 (2.6)\n+10.0\"\n219/471\n\nMental retardation\n60.2 (3.5) 55.2 (3.0) -5.0\n30.3 (3.3) 32.6 (2.9) +2.3\n6.3 (1.7) 9.5 (1.8) +3.2\n5.9 (1.7) 11.4 (2.0)\n+5.5* 323/607\n\nEmotional Hearing disturbance impairment\n\n67.5 (3.7) 61.5 (3.0) -6.0\n\n61.0 (3.5) 60.8 (3.2)\n-.2\n\n24.9 (3.4) 24.2 (2.6)\n-.7\n\n20.4 (2.9) 17.7 (2.5) -2.7\n\n6.0 (1.9) 10.5 (1.9) +4.5\n\n14.4 (2.5) 16.1 (2.4) +1.7\n\n1.5 (1.0)\n8.9 (1.8)\n+7.4*** 288/575\n\n18.0 (2.8) 40.4 (3.3) +22.4***\n626/612\n\nVisual impairment\n62.7 (4.9) 60.9 (4.2) -1.8\n26.1 (4.4) 19.5 (3.4) -6.6\n7.7 (2.7) 15.4 (3.1)\n+7.7**\n5.6 (2.3) 17.7 (3.3)\n+12.1\"\n339/489\n\nOrthopedic Other health Multiple impairment impairment disabilities\n\n62.6 (4.4) 64.3 (3.2) -1.7\n\n55.0 (4.8) 74.9 (2.2) +19.9***\n\n63.0 (6.3) 65.3 (3.0) +2.3\n\n20.2 (3.7) 14.9 (2.4) -5.3\n\n17.2 (3.7) 15.0 (1.8) -2.2\n\n20.8 (5.3) 18.3 (2.4) -2.5\n\n15.5 (3.3) 16.6 (2.5) +1.1\n\n24.4 (4.2) 7.2 (1.3)\n-17.2***\n\n10.8 (4.0) 12.0 (2.0) +1.2\n\n7.6 (2.5) 14.9 (2.5) +7.3\n300/627\n\n10.3 (3.0) 9.0 (1.5) -1.3 229/1,226\n\n33.5 (6.1)\n15.6 (2.3)\n-17.9\"\n281/739\n\nStandard errors are in parentheses.\nStatistically significant difference in a two-tailed test at the following levels: *p<.05, \"p<.01,***p<.001.\n5 Source: NLTS2.\ne.D\n\n\f24th Annual Report to Congress\ncommunication. Decreases in the use of a language other than English were noted for students with other health impairments and multiple disabilities; the decrease of 18 percentage points for the latter group was statistically significant.\nHousehold and Parent Characteristics\nSeveral of the patterns of change in the households of students with disabilities that were observed for the group as a whole applied fairly uniformly across disability categories, including the general stability in living arrangements and the significant decrease in the number of children in the household. However, Table 11-13 shows that the overall absence of significant change in the percentage of students living in single-parent households was seen only in some disability categories. Most notably, the decline was 17 percentage points among students with other health impairments. This large reduction was in the category of students with among the highest rates in Cohort 1.\nChanges in parent characteristics also did not always affect students equally across disability categories. For example, although all categories of Cohort 2 students were significantly less likely than those in Cohort 1 to have parents who had not graduated from high school, the significant increase in college graduates that was evident for students with disabilities as a whole occurred only among parents of students in six disability categories, with increases ranging from 7 to 12 percentage points. The increases in college graduates among parents of students with learning disabilities,\nmental retardation, and visual impairments were not statistically significant.\nImprovements in employment status also did not occur uniformly. Although there were fewer heads of households who were not employed and more who were employed full-time in all categories, heads of households of students with emotional disturbances, visual impairments, and multiple disabilities experienced those changes to a lesser degree than most others.\nWhile household incomes improved markedly for all students with disabilities, the percentage point drop in households with incomes of less than $25,000 ranged\nwidely, from 20 percentage points for households of students with mental retardation and 30 percentage points for those with emotional disturbance to 47 percentage points for students with speech/language impairments and almost 46 percentage points for those with other health impairments. Students with mental\nretardation and emotional disturbance also had the smallest increases in households earning more than $50,000. One fourth to more than one half of households of students with disabilities had annual incomes of $25,000 or less.\n11-40\n146\n\n\fTable 11-13\nChanges in Household and Parent Characteristics, by Cohort and Disability Category\n\nHousehold characteristics Percentage living in a single-parent household\nCohort 1 Cohort 2\nPercentage point change Percentage with head of household with 4-year college degree or more\nCohort 1 Cohort 2\nPercentage point change Percentage with a head of household who was:\nEmployed full time Cohort 1 Cohort 2\nPercentage point change\nNot employed Cohort 1 Cohort 2\nPercentage point change\n\nLearning disability\n\nSpeech/ language impairment\n\n33.6 (3.3) 35.3 (2.9) +1.7\n\n44.7 (4.5) 33.1 (3.1) -9.6\n\n8.8 (2.0) 11.9 (2.0) +3.1\n\n11.4 (2.9) 22.6 (2.9) +11.2**\n\n66.2 (3.3) 77.3 (2.6) +11.1**\n\n61.2 (4.4) 77.9 (2.9) +16.74*\n\n25.3 (3.0) 14.9 (2.2) -10.4**\n\n27.0 (4.1) 14.6 (2.5)\n-U.4**\n\nMental\n\nEmotional Hearing\n\nVisual Orthopedic Other health Multiple\n\nretardation disturbance impairment impairment impairment impairments disabilities\n\n36.3 (3.6) 43.7 (3.0) +7.4\n\n41.8 (4.0) 46.5 (3.2) +4.7\n\n34.1 (3.4) 34.6 (3.6)\n.5\n\n36.2 (4.8) 41.5 (4.2) +5.3\n\n37.4 (4.5) 32.6 (3.2) -5.8\n\n44.7 (5.0) 27.4 (2.3)\n47.3***\n\n38.1 (6.8) 34.3 (3.0) -3.8\n\n5.7 (1.7) 9.3 (1.8) +3.6\n\n6.0 (1.9) 13.4 (2.1)\n+7.4**\n\n11.2 (2.3) 23.0 (2.9) +11.8**\n\n15.4 (3.6) 17.1 (3.3) +1.7\n\n17.3 (3.5) 27.8 (3.1) +10.5*\n\n17.1 (3.8) 27.4 (2.3) +10.3*\n\n12.7 (4.7) 23.9 (2.8) +11.2*\n\n48.6 (3.7) 61.4 (3.1) +12.8**\n\n64.9 (3.9) 66.8 (3.0) +1.9\n\n66.7 (3.4) 76.0 (3.0)\n+93*\n\n65.2 (4.8) 68.0 (4.0) +2.5\n\n57.3 (4.6) 74.0 (3.1) +16.7**\n\n54.8 (5.0) 78.0 (2.2) +23.24ci*\n\n64.9 (6.8) 69.7 (3.0) +4.8\n\n43.3 (3.7) 29.6 (2.9) -13.7**\n\n25.9 (3.6) 25.8 (2.8)\n-.1\n\n25.9 (3.2) 18.0 (2.7) -7.9\n\n26.4 (4.4) 19.9 (3.5) -6.5\n\n34.1 (4.4)\n17.1 (2.7)\n-17.0m\n\n30.5 (4.6) 15.0 (1.9) -15.5**\n\n30.8 (6.5) 22.6 (2.7) -8.2\n\n\fTable 11-13 (continued)\n\nHousehold characteristics Percentage in a household with annual income of:\n$25,000 or less Cohort 1 Cohort 2\nPercentage point change More than $50,000\nCohort 1 Cohort 2\nPercentage point change Percentage in a household that recently received:\nAFDC/TANF Cohort 1 Cohort 2\nPercentage point change\n\nLearning disability\n\nSpeech/ language impairment\n\nMental retardation\n\nEmotional Hearing disturbance impairment\n\nVisual impairment\n\n65.0 (3.4) 31.0 (3.0) -34.0***\n\n72.7 (4.1) 25.6 (3.2) -47.1***\n\n74.8 (3.4) 54.4 (3.3) -20.4***\n\n72.9 (3.7) 42.8 (3.2) -30.14424'\n\n67.9 (3.5) 30.7 (3.3) -37.2***\n\n65.3 (5.0) 29.6 (4.0) -35.744*\n\n5.3 (1.6) 37.9 (3.1) +32.644*\n\n6.8 (2.3) 43.2 (3.6) +36.444*\n\n1.7 (1.0) 18.2 (2.6) +16.34**\n\n5.4 (1.9)\n27.9 (2.9)\n+22.5*\"\n\n6.9 (1.9) 40.3 (3.5) +33.4***\n\n4.4 (2.1) 35.8 (4.2) +31.4***\n\n14.2 (2.4) 9.2 (1.8) -5.0\n\n10.6 (2.8) 8.9 (2.0) -1.7\n\n16.3 (2.7) 15.2 (2.3) -1.1\n\n12.3 (2.7) 14.9 (2.3) +2.6\n\n9.2 (2.1) 8.5 (1.9) -.7\n\n13.0 (3.4) 11.0 (2.7) -2.3\n\nFood Stamps Cohort 1 Cohort 2\nPercentage point change Sample size: Cohort 1/2\n\n25.7 (3.0) 14.0 (2.2) -11.7**\n328/564\n\nNotes: Standard errors are in parentheses.\n\n22.9 (3.8) 11.7 (2.2) -11.2* 196/401\n\n33.0 (3.5) 24.6 (2.7) -8.4\n272/536\n\n25.5 (3.6) 25.0 (2.8)\n-.5\n260/509\n\n18.8 (2.8) 11.7 (2.2) -7.1*\n551/542\n\n19.9 (4.0) 9.7 (2.5)\n-10.2* 299/430\n\nStatistically significant difference in a two-tailed test at the following levels: *p<.05, **p<.01,***p<.001.

Along with students with mental retardation, they were the only categories whose drop in food stamp participation was not statistically significant.\nConclusion\nThis analysis of changes in the characteristics of high-school-age students with disabilities between 1987 and 2001 reveals both improvements and challenges. For example, an improved economy was apparent in higher employment rates in 2001 than in 1987, and Cohort 2 parents were substantially better educated than their predecessors. However, these improvements also may have reflected shifts in the demographics of students and their households. The racial/ethnic distribution of students with disabilities more closely resembled that of the general population in 2001 than in 1987. However, more students came from blended families, rather than traditional families with two biological parents, and more students had bilingual and bicultural backgrounds. These changes may add challenges and stress to the lives of\nyouth with disabilities and their families that were less prevalent in earlier years.\nThe increasing racial/ethnic and language diversity of students was matched by an increasing diversity of disabilities. For example, Cohort 2 students were markedly more likely to have their disabilities identified and served at younger ages. Sharp increases in the numbers of students with such disabilities as ADHD and autism changed the mix of the population of students with disabilities further.\nThe increased diversity along multiple dimensions among high-school-age students receiving special education may well have been met by changes in school policies and programs to accommodate the increased diversity. Further analyses will be needed to identify changes in students' schools and school programs and to assess the impacts\nof changes in students' characteristics and in their programs on students'\nperformance in high school and early adulthood. Over the next several years, NLTS2 will generate those analyses to inform policy-making and program improvement.\nII-43\n4\n\n\f24th Annual Report to Congress\nReferences\nFederal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics.

PROGRAMS AND SERVICES\nEnsuring an Adequate Supply of High-Quality, School-Based Speech-Language Pathologists\nSocial Adaptation and Problem Behaviors of Elementary and Middle School Students Receiving Special Education\nEducational Environments for Students With Disabilities\nStudy of State and Local Implementation and Impact of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act: A View From the\nField of District Implementation\n\n\fEnsuring an Adequate Supply of High-Quality, School-Based Speech-Language Pathologists\nIn 1999-2000, 1,089,964 students had speech or language impairments as their primary disability, accounting for 19.2% of all students ages 6 through 21 with disabilities served under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) (U.S. Department of Education, 2001). Many additional students had speech or language impairments as secondary or tertiary disabilities. The high incidence of speech/language impairments requires a large, highly qualified pool of speechlanguage pathologists to meet these students' needs.\nThe quality of the nation's speech-language pathologist workforce depends on having an adequate supply of qualified individuals. Should shortages occur, local districts may be forced to hire less qualified personnel or assign staff to positions for which they are unprepared. This module describes the nation's school-based speechlanguage pathologists in terms of quantity and quality. It also describes the severity of current shortages, threats of future shortages, and the association between working conditions and speech-language pathologists' intent to stay in the\nprofession. Finally, the module documents speech-language pathologists'\nqualifications and credentials, the impact of professional development on perceptions of competence, and factors that explain some variation in workforce\nquality.\nThe data in this module are drawn from the Study of Personnel Needs in Special Education (SPeNSE). The U.S. Department of Education's Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) contracted with Westat to conduct this study in order to address concerns about nationwide shortages in the number of personnel serving students with disabilities and the need for improvement in the qualifications of those employed.' In all, 8,061 special education service providers completed SPeNSE interviews. Service providers interviewed included special education teachers, general education teachers, speech-language pathologists, and paraprofessionals. The information in this module is reported as weighted estimates based on the results from interviews with the 868 participating school-based speech-language pathologists and their local administrators.\n' For more information on SPeNSE, visit the SPeNSE web site at www.spense.org.\n152\n\n\f241 Annual Report to Congress\nIssues of Quantity\nAccording to SPeNSE estimates, the nation's educational agencies employed 49,721 speech-language pathologists in 1999-2000. This compares to reports from state education agencies that they employed 37,054 full-time equivalent speech-language pathologists (see Table AC3). Full-time equivalents are, by definition, lower than counts of individuals because two half-time employees would be reported as one full-time equivalent. Having an adequate supply of school-based speech-language pathologists is as important as the quality of those available because shortages typically force administrators to hire less qualified individuals. Even if the supply meets demand overall, that is unlikely to be the case in every district across the\ncountry. Nationwide, 86% of local special education administrators with job\nopenings for speech-language pathologists hired personnel whom they considered to be fully qualified for some or all of those positions.2 Twelve percent hired one or more speech-language pathologists whom they considered less than fully qualified. Those who were unable to fill all their openings used other methods to deal with shortages. Twenty percent increased other speech-language pathologists' caseloads; 18% hired speech-language pathology assistants; and 33% contracted for speech services. These findings were similar to the results of searches for physical therapists and occupational therapists and do not, in and of themselves, suggest a severe shortage of speech-language pathologists. However, when asked to what extent a shortage of qualified applicants was a barrier to hiring speech-language pathologists, 59% of administrators said \"a great extent.\"\nPerhaps of greater concern than current shortages is the potential for future\nshortages. Forty-nine percent of school-based speech-language pathologists are 45 years of age or older and will be eligible to retire over the next 15 years. The eldest groups of speech-language pathologists are in suburban and rural communities and in the western region of the United States; therefore, shortages may worsen more quickly in those areas. Another 5% of the workforce reported that they plan to leave school-based practice as soon as possible, for reasons unrelated to age or retirement.\nFigure III-1 demonstrates the uneven distribution of school-based speech-language pathologists by age. As can be seen, the larger cohort is the group of speechlanguage pathologists who are 45 or older. There are fewer speech-language pathologists available in the younger age groups to fill the anticipated age-related vacancies that will likely occur.\n\n2 The definition of \"fully qualified\" varies by state and district.\n\nIII-2\n\n153\n\n\fEnsuring an Adequate Supply of High-Quality, School-Based Speech-Language Pathologists\nFigure III-1 Distribution of School-Based Speech-Language Pathologists by Age\n\n3000\n\n2500\n\n2000\n\n3 1500\n0\n1000\n\n500\n\n0\n\n-F lThmr-\n\n24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50 52 54 56 58 60 62 64 67 69 75\n\nAge\n\nSource: SPeNSE.\n\nWorking Conditions and Then. Relationship to Career Plans\nPoor working conditions may limit the time and attention speech-language pathologists' devote to meeting the needs of their students and may contribute to attrition. Conversely, good working conditions may contribute to the quality of\nservices and to personnel retention. The working conditions described here include:\ncaseload;\njob responsibilities; and\nschool climate, which includes perceived levels of support from\nadministrators and colleagues.\n\nBEST COPY/AMIABLE\n\n154\n\nIII-3\n\n\f24111 Annual Report to Congress\nEach of these working conditions has been tied to teacher attrition (Billingsley, 1993; Brownell & Smith, 1992; Morvant, Gersten, Gillman, Keating, & Blake, 1995) although the connection with attrition for speech-language pathologists is less well\ndocumented. Although SPeNSE did not include a direct measure of attrition, it included a measure of speech-language pathologists' intent to stay in their position,\nwhich is highly correlated with attrition (Morvant et al., 1995).\nCaseload\nOne approach to addressing shortages of speech-language pathologists is to increase caseloads. However, since research suggests that caseload size and characteristics are associated with teacher attrition, this method of addressing shortages may actually\nexacerbate them. It seems possible that the same would hold true for speech-\nlanguage pathologists.\nSPeNSE data indicate that in 1999-2000, a typical school-based speech-language\npathologist served 49 students per week. This caseload included students representing a wide range of ages, different primary disability categories, and\ndifferent speech-language impairments. Only 5% of speech-language pathologists served students who all had the same primary disability; 40% had caseloads with six or more different disabilities represented. Speech or language impairments, learning disabilities, mental retardation, and autism were the most common disabilities among the students served.\nSpeech-language pathologists also served students with a variety of different speechlanguage impairments. Nearly all speech-language pathologists reported serving students with language disorders and articulation or phonological disorders. Almost three quarters served students with fluency disorders, and more than half served students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, and/or apraxia (see Table III-1).\nFurthermore, speech-language pathologists' caseloads comprised students from many different cultural and linguistic groups. Speech-language pathologists reported that, on average, more than one fourth of their students were from a cultural or\nlinguistic group different from their own, and 8.8% were English-language learners.\nCaseload size was significantly associated with speech-language pathologists' intent to stay in the profession. The median caseload for speech-language pathologists who planned to stay as long as possible or until retirement was 46.2 students, compared to 49.2 for those who were undecided about their career plans and 59.7 for those\n\n111-4\n\n155\n\n\fEnsuring an Adequate Supply of High-Quality, School-Based Speech-Language Pathologists\n\nTable III-1 Percent of School-Based Speech-Language Pathologists Serving Students\nWith Different Speech-Language Impairments\n\nSpeech-language impairments\nLanguage disorders An impairment in the ability to understand and/or use words in context, both verbally and nonverbally.

There were no significant differences in speech-language pathologists'\ncareer plans based on most other caseload characteristics, such as cultural or\nlinguistic diversity. Those who planned to leave as soon as possible were more likely to serve students with fluency disorders, but the reason for that relationship is not\nclear.\nJob Responsibilities\nTo ensure that speech-language pathologists receive the support and training needed to meet their current job responsibilities, it is important to understand what those responsibilities are. The typical school-based speech-language pathologist spent 24.5 hours per week providing direct services to students. They averaged 149 sessions per month and served students primarily in groups rather than individually. Twenty-six percent of their sessions were one-on-one. Speech-language pathologists devoted, on\naverage, 7.1 hours per week to completing paperwork, 4.6 hours per week to\npreparing services, 1.8 hours per week to sharing expertise with colleagues, 1.7 hours per week to reading background material, and 0.9 hours per week to communicating with parents. The school-based speech-language pathologists who participated in SPeNSE also reported a number of other job responsibilities, for a total average work week of 49 hours. The sample included both full- and part-time practitioners.\n\nIII-6\n\n1 5 7\n\n\fEnsuring an Adequate Supply of High-Quality, School-Based Speech-Language Pathologists\nThe IDEA Amendments of 1997 placed a new emphasis on ensuring that students with disabilities have access to the general curriculum. Implementing individualized education programs that support students in academic, nonacademic, and extracurricular activities may require that speech-language pathologists add collaborative consultation, curriculum-based intervention programs, classroom-based services, and authentic assessments to their service model (Whitmire, 2000). Despite\nIDEA guidance stipulating that services be provided in the least restrictive environment possible, speech-language pathologists reported providing 82.8% of\ntheir services in special education settings, such as resource rooms for students with speech-language impairments.\nOverall, 70% of school-based speech-language pathologists reported that they found their workload manageable to a moderate or great extent; 22.6% found it manageable to a small extent; and 4.1% found it not at all manageable. These findings are similar to SPeNSE percentages for special education teachers. The total number of sessions\nper month and the number of individual sessions per month were unrelated to\nspeech-language pathologists' intent to stay in school-based positions.\nSchool Climate\nIntangible aspects of a position, such as perceived support, may be as important to attrition and retention as are more easily measured job characteristics such as caseload size. School climate is a subjective measure of the way speech-language pathologists feel about the schools in which they work and includes perceived levels of support from colleagues and administrators. On a scale from 1 (worst climate) to 100 (best climate), speech-language pathologists rated the climate of their schools as 71. The manageability of speech-language pathologists' worldoads was significantly related to their perception of the climate of their schools. Those in schools with a positive climate found their work significantly more manageable. School climate was\nalso significantly related to speech-language pathologists' intent to stay in the\nprofession: a less positive climate was reported by those who were undecided or planned to leave as soon as possible.\nIssues of Quality\nThe quality of the nation's school-based speech-language pathologists is as important as the quantity. This section describes quality both in terms of credentials, including certification and licensure, advanced degrees, and years of experience, and in terms of perceived skillfulness. Because states differ in the minimal qualifications they require of speech-language pathologists, those requirements are also discussed.\n\n158\n\nIII-7\n\n\f24th Annual Report to Congress\nCredentials\nStates differ in their requirements for working as a school-based speech-language pathologist. Some states use universal licensure, which is a state license to practice speech-language pathology in school and healthcare settings that is typically issued and administered by the state's department of professional regulation. Some states exempt school-based speech-language pathologists from the licensing law but have other requirements established by the state education agency. Others require both state licensure and teacher certification or state licensure plus education-specific coursework and examinations. States may also require speech-language pathologists to have at least a master's degree and to be state licensed or to meet additional requirements (Pilch, 2001). Nationwide, SPeNSE data indicate that 92% of schoolbased speech-language pathologists hold some form of license or certificate to provide speech-language pathology.\nAdvanced Degrees\nThirty-six states require speech-language pathologists to hold at least a master's degree. However, many individuals working as speech-language pathologists in those states entered the field when only a bachelor's degree was required. Generally, states require bachelor's level personnel to acquire a master's degree within a certain time or risk dismissal. However, seven states (Alabama, Arizona, Nevada, New York, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee) allow bachelor's level personnel to work as speech-language pathologists in the public schools with no requirement that thty pursue a master's. Three states (Alaska, Utah, Vermont) allow bachelor's level personnel to work as school-based speech-language pathologists under emergency certification (Pilch, 2001). Nationwide, SPeNSE findings indicate that almost 87% of speech-language pathologists had master's degrees, compared with 59% of special education teachers.\nAmerican Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) Certificate of Clinical Competence in Speech-Language Pathology\nSeventy-one percent of speech-language pathologists report they have or will soon have their Certificate of Clinical Competence (CCC). This credential indicates that an individual has met national speech-language pathology requirements set by ASHA\nand has achieved the highest qualification in the nation for speech-language\npathologists. This certification is frequently used as a national standard by employers for hiring qualified speech-language pathologists (ASHA, 2000a,b; Pilch, 2001).\n\nIII-8\n\n159\n\n\fEnsuring an Adequate Supply of High-Quality, School-Based Speech-Language Pathologists\nCandidates for the CCC must complete a master's-level graduate program that meets\nASHA CCC requirements and/or is accredited by the Council on Academic\nAccreditation in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology (ASHA, 2000a; ASHA,\n2001). The program must include 36 semester credit hours in professional\ncoursework, 25 hours of supervised clinical observation, and a 350-hour supervised clinical practicum (ASHA, 2000a). Applicants must complete the equivalent of a fulltime, 9-month, paid clinical fellowship under the supervision of an ASHA-certified professional and achieve passing scores on two certification exams. One exam is a national paper-pencil exam developed by the Educational Testing Service for speechlanguage pathologists, and the other is a portfolio-like review performed three times during the speech-language pathologist's first year of paid employment (ASHA, 2000b).\nASHA compares the CCC standards to those presently required for certification by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS), the teaching profession's highest credential for highly skilled teachers (ASHA, 2000b). The requirements are similar with the following exceptions: ASHA requires a master's degree and completion of the three portfolio-like reviews described above. NBPTS uses a 1/2-day assessment that measures teacher knowledge of subject matter content. Candidates are also required to submit four portfolio entries over a school year. Three entries are classroom based and include two videos that document the candidate's teaching practice through student work. The fourth entry consists of written commentary reflecting the candidate's work with students, families, and community and collaboration with the professional community. NBPTS candidates may have at a minimum a bachelor's degree and may have multiple years of teaching experience. The NBPTS award is relatively new; the first certificate was issued in 1993. ASHA has been certifying providers since 1952.\nYears of Eapeneace\nOn average, school-based speech-language pathologists had 14 years of experience providing speech-language services in public or private schools. Twenty-nine percent of the speech-language pathologist workforce reported that all of their years of experience were not consecutive but that they had typically been working at least 10 consecutive years since returning to work.\nFigure 111-2 shows that speech-language pathologists with more years of experience were less likely than their less experienced peers to have the CCC. Of those with 1 through 3 years of experience, 89.4% held the CCC. Of speech-language pathologists\n160\n\n\f24111 Annual Report to Congress\nFigure 111-2\nPercent of ASHA-Certified Speech-Language Pathologists by Years of Experience\n\n100 89.4\n90 -\n80 2\n70\n60\n=\ncn 50\ntls 40\na.) 30\n4.4\na.)\n20 -\n10 -\n0\n3 or Less Years\n\n83.1 80.6 62.6\n\n4-6 Years\n\n7-9 Years\n\nYears of Experience\n\n10 or More Years\n\nSource: SPeNSE.\nwith 4 through 6 years of experience, 83.1% had the CCC.

When asked to assess their skill in specific jobrelated tasks, speech-language pathologists usually indicated they were skillful from a\nmoderate to a great extent. The areas in which school-based speech-language pathologists felt most skillful included interpreting results of standardized tests, planning effective services, using appropriate clinical skills, and monitoring student\nprogress and adjusting instruction accordingly. Areas in which they felt least skillful\n\nBEST COPY AVAILABLE 161\n\n\fEnsuring an Adequate Supply of High-Quality, School-Based Speech-Language Pathologists\n\nTable 111-2\nSpeech-Language Pathologists' Perceived Areas of Strengths and Needs\n\nMost skillful areas Interpreting results of standardized tests Planning effective services\nUsing appropriate clinical skills Monitoring students' progress and adjusting instruction accordingly Source: SPeNSE.\n\nLeast skillful areas\nUsing technology in instruction Accommodating culturally and linguistically diverse students' leatning needs\nSupervising paraprofessionals Using professional literature to address problems encountered in providing services\n\nincluded using technology in instruction, accommodating culturally and linguistically diverse students' needs, supervising paraprofessionals, and using professional literature to address problems encountered in providing services (see Table 111-2). In response to questions about their attitudes toward their work, most speech-language pathologists agreed that they can work with even the most difficult or unmotivated\nstudents, have enough preparation and relevant experience to deal with most\nstudents' learning problems, have students who are capable of learning the material provided, can deal successfully with students' behavior problems, and make a significant difference in the lives of their students.\nIndividuals differ in the professional skills they bring to their job, and factors such as\nyears of experience, credentials, and exposure to professional development\nopportunities may help explain that variation. In many skill areas, speech-language pathologists with 3 or more years of experience rated their skills higher than did their less experienced peers, although the differences were small. These areas included using technology in instruction, collaborating with regular education teachers and related services personnel, working with parents, managing student behavior, using professional literature to address problems, and supervising paraprofessionals. However, there were no significant differences in their reported use of best practices for managing behavior or teaching English language learners. In contrast, teachers with 3 or more years of experience were more likely to report using practices that facilitate inclusion of students with disabilities in classes with their nondisabled peers, but these differences were quite small. They may reflect more experienced teachers'\ngreater comfort with collaboration.\nFor administrators hiring new staff, credentials may be one way of distinguishing among more and less qualified applicants. However, in this study, there were no significant differences between speech-language pathologists with and without a\n\n162\n\n\f24111 Annual Report to Congress\nCCC in their perceived level of skill in various job-related activities. This may reflect the greater professional experience of speech-language pathologists without a CCC, because experience was associated with perceived skill, and those without a CCC were on average more experienced.\nIn contrast, the content of preservice preparation and amount of continuing\nprofessional development in which speech-language pathologists participated was clearly related to their perceived level of skill. Recently prepared speech-language\npathologists' (those with 6 or fewer years of experience) whose preservice preparation included using technology in instruction, addressing the needs of\nculturally and linguistically diverse students, supervising paraprofessionals,\nmonitoring students' progress and adjusting instruction accordingly, and using professional literature to address problems rated their skills in these areas more\nhighly than those with no such training.\nSpeech-language pathologists who had 8 or more hours of professional development in a specific topic in the past 3 years also reported higher levels of skill than speechlanguage pathologists who had fewer than 8 hours.' This was true for every skill area addressed, including:\nusing appropriate clinical skills;\nusing technology in instruction;\naccommodating culturally and linguistically diverse students' instructional needs;\nmanaging behavior; and\ninterpreting standardized test results.\nFor example, speech-language pathologists with more than 8 hours of professional development in using technology in instruction felt skillful to a moderate/great extent; those with 1 to 8 hours felt skillful to a small/moderate extent; and those with no hours felt skillful to a small extent. A similar pattern emerged for perceived skill in managing student behavior based on hours of professional development.\nMost speech-language pathologists had little or no training in supervising\n3 Recently prepared school-based speech-language pathologists constitute 28.5% of those employed nationwide.\n4 The percentage of speech-language pathologists who received more than 8 hours of professional development ranged from 11.7% for supervising paraprofessionals to 71.6% for using appropriate\nclinical skills.\nIII-12\nn\n\n\fEnsuring an Adequate Supply of High-Quality, School-Based Speech-Language Pathologists\nparaprofessionals, which may account for low levels of perceived skill in this area. Clearly, the content and duration of professional development opportunities was important in relation to perceived skill. It is interesting to note that differences in\nperceived skill were rarely significant between those with no professional\ndevelopment and those with 1 to 8 hours of professional development. Rather, the differences were associated with professional development of 8 hours or more.\nSummary and Implications\nAlthough many of the data here are subject to the limitation of self-report, SPeNSE provides important information about the speech-language pathologist workforce. Because so many students with disabilities require speech-language services, ensuring an adequate supply of high-quality speech-language pathologists is crucial to the success of the students served under IDEA. SPeNSE data suggest that the current shortage of speech-language pathologists is mild, but the threat of future shortages is\nmore pronounced. The age distribution of the workforce is a major cause for\nconcern. Almost half of all school-based speech-language pathologists will be eligible for retirement within approximately 15 years. Unless the number of newly prepared speech-language pathologists increases substantially, a severe shortage seems unavoidable. The percentage of speech-language pathologists who reported that they plan to leave the profession as soon as possible is also of concern. Future shortages may be averted or moderated through preventative actions, such as:\ninducing speech-language pathologists to work beyond the typical age of\nretirement;\nreducing attrition among those below retirement age; and\nincreasing the number of fully qualified speech-language pathologists\nentering the profession.\nThe SPeNSE findings suggest several approaches for reducing attrition. One approach is to keep caseloads to 46 or fewer students. Another is to take steps to\nimprove perceived school climate by increasing speech-language pathologists' sense of belonging and bolstering their perceptions of support from administrators and colleagues.\nThe nation's school-based speech-language pathologists are a great asset. They are highly qualified for their positions and bring to their jobs a wealth of experience. However, as the skills required for school-based speech-language pathology change in response to emerging student populations and new service delivery models, these\n164\n\n\f24111 Annual Report to Congress\nhighly experienced personnel will require continuing professional development to keep pace with changes in the field. School-based speech-language pathologists rated\ntheir skills relatively low in a few areas, suggesting a need for professional\ndevelopment in using technology in instruction, accommodating diverse students' needs, supervising paraprofessionals, using literature to address problems, and managing student behavior. These findings are consistent with issues identified by ASHA. Its agenda calls for activities to address (a) services for culturally and\nlinguistically diverse students, (b) improved use of web-based and advanced\ntechnology, and (c) supervision of speech-language pathology assistants (Whitmire &\nClausen, 2001). Finally, SPeNSE data indicate that professional development activities of relatively short duration (i.e., fewer than 8 hours) did not increase speech-language pathologists' perception of their skills. This finding suggests that training of longer duration or greater intensity may be more helpful in raising\nperceived skill levels.\nIII-14\n165\n\n\fEnsuring an Adequate Supply of High-Quality, School-Based Speech-Language Pathologists\nReferences\nAmerican Speech-Language-Hearing Association.

There had been many calls for\ncomprehensive assessment of special education students (e.g., Sabornie, 1994), and IDEA posited that understanding the relationship between learning and behavior was crucial to planning an individualized education program (IEP). For students with behavioral problems, as for all students served under IDEA, the IEP is a blueprint for change and a key to the goal of giving students with disabilities access to the regular education curriculum. Functional behavioral assessments are specifically required for students whose behavior interferes with the educational process. Functional behavioral assessments are intended to provide concrete, measurable information about the status and progress of students in special education (Sugai, Lewis-Palmer, & Hagan, 1998) and to provide the rationale and goals that are the basis for an IEP (Scott & Nelson, 1999). Thus, functional behavioral assessment and\nbehavioral intervention planning, which includes IEP planning and proposed\nresponses to disciplinary actions, may be viewed as a single, integrated, continuous process Golivette, Scott, & Nelson, 2000).\nPublic focus on students with behavioral problems has increased in recent years for at least three reasons. First, disruptive behavior interferes with the educational process and places a burden on teachers. Concerns about the quality of education in the United States have fueled greater attention to students who cannot or will not follow classroom rules. Second, today's youth are much more at risk for negative outcomes as a result of long-term exposure to poverty, social fragmentation, and violence in their communities (Walker, Zeller, & Close, 1999). For children with behavior problems, academic success is viewed as a pathway to a productive future, while recovery from academic failure and school dropout can be extremely difficult. Third, students with behavioral and emotional disorders are often involvedeither as perpetrators or victimsin acts of school violence.\nHow widespread is school violence? It depends. On the question of protecting life and limb, schools are very safe. According to the Justice Policy Institute (Donohue, Schiraldi, & Ziedenberg, 1998), there was less than a one-in-a-million chance that a school-aged child would be killed in school during the 1998-99 school years. During 1992-93, a period associated with a high number of school-related homicides, the likelihood of a child being murdered away from school was 115 times greater than the chances of a violent death at school (Snyder & Sickmund, 1999). The final report\nIII-17\n167\n\n\f24111 Annual Report to Congress\nof the bi-partisan working group on youth violence to the 106111 Congress in February 2000 concluded that schools are among the safest places for children to be.\nShootings and homicides are at one extreme in the spectrum of hurtful acts at school. Bullying, fighting, and other forms of aggression are more commonplace in classrooms and on playgrounds (Olweus, Block, & Radke-Yarrow, 1986). When a student in the regular classroom is identified as a chronic source of aggressive, bullying, or harmful behaviors, he or she may be referred for evaluation and placement in special education. Of course, not all disruptive and misbehaving children require assessment and placement. There are no straightforward, one-to-one relationships among past, present, and future behavior. Behavior is highly contextspecific and may not generalize over time or across settings. Nevertheless, many behaviors do become consolidated into a pattern over time, and students with recurrent behavior problems are at risk for later delinquency or criminality. As Sprague, Walker, and Stieber (2001) observed, the relationship between disciplinary\nreferrals and delinquency or criminality has predictive power.\nDisciplinary referrals require disciplinary policies and procedures. For example, some\nsuggest that punishment stimulates avoidance and does little to abrogate the\nconditions that elicit bad conduct (e.g., Walker et al., 1999). Similarly, social skills training programs have had limited success in reducing aggressive behavior (Cairns & Cairns, 1997; Gresham, Sugai, & Homer, 2001). Social skills interventions attempt to reduce deviance and aggressiveness through training designed to improve social competence, which recipients presumably lack. A drawback to these deficit-focus models is that lack of social skills may not be a characteristic of students who engage in deviant behaviors (Giordano, Cernkovich, & Pugh, 1986; Rodkin, Farmer, Pearl, & Van Acker, 2000). Deficit models often fail to account for the adaptive functions of some problem behaviors, for example, gang participation (Cairns, Cadwallader, Estell, & Neckerman, 1997).\nBehavior is strongly influenced by social and contextual conditions. Deviant and aggressive children are often both \"architect and victim\" of circumstances that limit positive, productive interactions with others (Patterson, 1976). But social interactions are only one piece of the puzzle. Correlated conditions that constrain behavior include peer social networks, the presence or absence of parental monitoring, poverty, and school performance. Comprehensive understanding of the sources and consequences of behavior, and the conditions that lead to lasting behavioral modification, demands a theoretical model that attends to what is present, as well as absent, in the social lives of children. Longitudinal research is a vital component of that model (Walker & Sprague, 1999).\nIII-18\n168\n\n\fSocial Adaptation and Problem Behaviors of Elementary and Middle School Students Receiving Special Education\nThe importance of behavior itself as an outcome, as well as its role as a mediating factor in many other important outcome domains, made it a priority area to address in OSEP's national assessment, including the Special Education Elementary Longitudinal Study (SEELS). One fundamental goal of SEELS is to follow over time the developmental pathways of children receiving special education. Therefore, the social development of students was emphasized when SEELS instruments were being designed. As a result, SEELS is well equipped to track the social progress of these youth as they transition from elementary school to middle and high school. The SEELS sample was drawn to be nationally representative. SEELS includes sources of information related to both social development and problem behavior. Social skills and social adaptation were described by the parents of SEELS students. Teachers also rated students' social skills and provided information about problem behaviors. Finally, parents detailed the disciplinary referrals of special education students through reports of suspensions and expulsions. The initial SEELS findings regarding social skills and adaptation are presented next.\nSocial Skills and Social Adaptation\nThe importance of childhood social interactions to positive child development is well established. Empirical research supports the common sense view that competence in social exchanges is a key factor in engagement at school and academic success. In the alternative, problems in social functioning usually indicate difficulties in multiple domains. Students receiving special education include a disproportionate number of\nstudents who are at high risk for delays or difficulties in social development, particularly students with autism and emotional disturbance (Cadwallader, Cameto, Blackorby, Giacalone, & Wagner, 2002). Parents reported that many students from other disability categories had difficulties in social development as secondary\nconditions. Students with these kinds of disabilities are most likely to be targeted for functional behavioral assessment and behavioral intervention plans.\nSocial Skills of Students ifith Disabilities\nThe social skills of students with disabilities were assessed through parent and teacher responses to items drawn from the Social Skills Rating System (SSRS), Teacher and Parent Forms (Gresham & Elliott, 1990).1 Teachers responded to 17 questions about students, and parents answered 11 questions about their children.\nThese items addressed three areas of social ability:\n\nSEELS teacher data were collected in spring 2001 by written survey from teachers who provided language arts instruction to SEELS students. Parent reports were obtained by telephone interview\nand written survey from summer 2000 through winter 2001.\n\n169\n\nIII-19\n\n\f24\"' Annual Report to Congress\nAssertiona student's ability and willingness to become involved in social\nactivities (e.g., joins groups without being told).\nSelf-controla students' ability to cope with frustration and to deal with\nconflict (e.g., ends disagreements calmly).\nCooperationa student's ability to cooperate and stay on task (e.g.,\ncooperates with family members without being asked to do so).\nThere are good reasons for collecting and reporting data from both parents and teachers. From a practical point of view, the different perspectives of the raters themselves may be of interest. Agreements and differences in teacher and parent ratings of SEELS students are detailed below.\nDifferences in Social Skills byDisability Category\nThere are reasons to expect that the impact of a disability on a student's social skills might vary by type of disability. For example, we might expect that students with severe cognitive or speech-language impairments could have problems with social functioning because of communication difficulties. Expressing personal intentions and expectations and recognizing the intentions of others are key ingredients in social relationships. Difficulties in expressing oneself or understanding others frequently undermine the development of prosocial behavior and self-identity through social interactions. Social functioning difficulties resulting from perceptual or expressive limitations also may lead to frustration and withdrawal from social interchanges. And children who cannot easily or do not engage in social contact have limited exposure to the reciprocity that guides much of our intra- and interpersonal development.\nTable 111-3 shows teacher and parent ratings of overall social skills. The social skills of students with disabilities were assessed using questions to caregivers that were drawn from the Social Skills Rating System, Parent Form (Gresham & Elliott, 1990). Parents and teachers responded to a number of questions about their children that addressed the three areas of social ability discussed above: assertion, self-control, and cooperation:\nA scale was created to measure each of these areas of social ability. The assertion and self-control scales range from 0 to 8 and have a mean score of 5. The cooperation scale ranges from 0 to 6 and has a mean of 4. A fourth scale was created by summing these three scales to create a broad measure of general social skills; it ranges from 0\nto 22 and has a mean of 14. Ratings are categorized as high (greater than one\nIII-20\n170\n\n\fSocial Adaptation and Problem Behaviors of Elementary and Middle School Students Receiving Special Education\n\nTable 111-3\nSocial Skills Ratings of Students With Disabilities\n\nPercentage with overall social skills rated: High Medium Low\nPercentage with assertion skills rated: High Medium Low\nPercentage with self-control skills rated: High Medium Low\nPercentage with cooperation skills rated: High Medium Low Sample size\n\nTeachers\n22.2 59.7 18.2\n22.3 66.6 11.1\n16.7 64.5 18.9\n20.6 64.9 14.5 4,541\n\nParents\n20.5 68.2 11.4\n33.8 58.7\n7.4\n17.8 71.2 10.9\n16.0 71.0 13.0 4,466\n\nNote: Ratings are based on a point system, where Low=1, Medium=2, and High=3.

It is worth noting that teachers and parents rate most students receiving special education as having medium to high social skills. Parents rated 89% of such students as medium to high on social skills, broadly defined. Teachers gave medium-to-high overall ratings to 82% of students.\nStudents got the highest scores for assertiveness, with over one third of students scoring high, and 93% being rated medium or high by parents. Teachers placed almost a quarter of these youth high on the assertion scale and ranked 89% medium to high for assertiveness. About one in six students scored in the high range on both parent and teacher ratings of cooperation. Teachers gave 81% and parents gave 89% of students medium to high marks for self-control.\nFigure 111-3 depicts total scale ratings by parents and teachers for students with different primary disabilities.

Parents and teachers generally agreed in their assessment of students with mental retardation, giving these students lower ratings on the selfcontrol scale than on the assertion and cooperation scales. The greatest differences\n\nIII-22\nBEST COPY AVAILABLE 172\n\n\fSocial Adaptation and Problem Behaviors of Elementary and Middle School Students Receiving Special Education\nbetween teachers and parents were in their assessment of students with emotional/ behavioral disorders, other health impairments, autism, and multiple disabilities. Notably, three of those four categories include students with significant behavioral problems (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is most often included in\nthe category of other health impairments). In every instance of significant\ndisagreement between teacher and parents, parents gave more positive ratings than teachers.\nCertain differences between teacher and parent ratings were striking. For example, parents said that 89% of the youth with multiple disabilities had medium to high levels of self-control. Teachers gave that same rating to only 69% of the students with multiple disabilities. On the self-control scale, parents described 84% of the children with autism as having medium to high skills. Teachers gave similar ratings to\nonly 61% of the students with autism. These differences in ratings were not consistent from scale to scale. In general, teacher and parent ratings were more\nclosely aligned on the cooperation scale than on the assertion and self-control scales. Parents and teachers agreed that 77% of the students with autism had medium to high scores for cooperation. They disagreed on the assertion scale; parents gave medium to high ratings to 63% of the children with autism, while teachers rated only 48% as medium to high on that dimension.\nDifficulty in social situations is one of the diagnostic criteria for children with autism and emotional/behavioral disabilities, and social skills ratings for these students were low. Nevertheless, teachers and parents did not fully agree on the social skills of students with emotional disorders (ED). Teachers said that 79% of the students with ED had medium to high assertion skills. Parents gave medium to high ratings to 89% of the children with ED. Teachers and parents both described students with ED as\nhaving low self-control. Parents gave low self-control ratings to 32% of the population with ED, while teachers rated 46% of those students as low on selfcontrol. As above, teachers and parents were more consistent on the cooperation\nscale. Teachers described 76% of the students with emotional/behavioral disorders as medium to highly cooperative. Parents gave medium to high ratings to 75% of the students with ED.\nCompared to parents, teachers consistently rank fewer youth in the high range for social skills and rate more students in the low range. Presumably, teachers have a greater range of student behaviors as a frame of referencethey work with large numbers of students and a continuum of behaviors.\nIII-23\n173\n\n\f2411 Annual Report to Congress\n\nTable 111-4\nStudents' Social Skills, by Age and Gender\n\nPercentage with overall social skills rated:\n\nHigh\n\nTeacher\n\nParent\n\nMedium Teacher\n\nParent\n\nLow\n\nTeacher\n\nParent\n\nPercentage with assertion skills rated:\n\nHigh\n\nTeacher\n\nParent\n\nMedium Teacher\n\nParent\n\nLow\n\nTeacher\n\nParent\n\nPercentage with self-control skills rated:\n\nHigh\n\nTeacher\n\nParent\n\nMedium Teacher\n\nParent\n\nLow\n\nTeacher\n\nParent\n\nPercentage with cooperation skills rated:\n\nHigh\n\nTeacher\n\nParent\n\nMedium Teacher\n\nParent\n\nLow\n\nTeacher\n\nParent\n\nSample size-Teacher\n\nSample size-Parent\n\nSource: SEELS.\n\n1.ke\n\n6 to 9 10 to 12\n\n23.4\n\n17.7\n\n22.4\n\n18.3\n\n60.6\n\n62.3\n\n66.4\n\n70.0\n\n16.0\n\n20.0\n\n11.2\n\n11.6\n\n25.0\n\n20.0\n\n38.7\n\n29.1\n\n65.3\n\n67.1\n\n54.0\n\n63.3\n\n9.7\n\n13.0\n\n7.3\n\n7.7\n\n16.6\n\n15.3\n\n18.4\n\n17.2\n\n64.6\n\n65.2\n\n70.9\n\n71.4\n\n18.8\n\n19.5\n\n10.7\n\n11.4\n\n21.8 17.3 65.4 70.4 12.8 12.3\n3,106 2,467\n\n16.9 14.1 65.7 71.9 17.5 14.0 2,362 1,882\n\nGender\n\nBoys\n\nGirls\n\n19.3\n\n28.2\n\n19.2\n\n22.8\n\n59.6\n\n59.4\n\n68.5\n\n67.6\n\n21.1\n\n12.3\n\n12.3\n\n9.5\n\n21.3\n\n24.4\n\n32.2\n\n37.2\n\n67.2\n\n65.1\n\n59.9\n\n56.2\n\n11.4\n\n10.5\n\n7.8\n\n6.6\n\n14.2\n\n21.9\n\n17.1\n\n19.1\n\n63.7\n\n66.2\n\n72.0\n\n70.2\n\n22.1\n\n12.0\n\n10.9\n\n10.7\n\n18.3 14.9 65.0 71.4 16.7 13.7 2,955 2,911\n\n25.5 17.9 64.5 70.4 10.0 11.7 1,536 1,507\n\nDemographic Differences ill Social Skills\nAge. As Table 111-4 illustrates, as age increased there was a downward trend in\noverall social skills ratings. There are at least two possible reasons for this\nphenomenon. First, the tendency of parents to give lower ratings to older students may reflect the changing mix of disabilities represented by the different age cohorts; students with greater difficulties were more likely to have continued receiving special education as they got older. Also, significant emotional issues were just emerging for some students in the late elementary years, causing an influx of more students with\n\n111-24\n\n174\n\n\fSocial Adaptation and Problem Behaviors of Elementary and Middle School Students Receiving Special Education\nED. Further, students may have been held to different standards of conduct as they got older. For example, hitting is tolerated more among kindergartners than it is among middle school students.\nGender. Teachers and parents alike identified slightly higher social skills ratings for girls compared with boys. Differences between boys and girls were relatively small,\nwhile differences between parent and teacher ratings were somewhat greater. Compared with parents, teachers gave higher ratings to girls and lower ratings to\nboys, particularly in the areas of assertion and self-control. Teachers identified more students at the top of the cooperation scale, while parents put more students in the medium category. It is important to recall, however, that boys substantially outnumber girls among the students who receive special education, and that is also represented in the sample for this study.\nOverall differences based on gender for students with disabilities were consistent with those found among the general population of students at this age (Ruble & Martin, 1998). Differences in social characteristics of boys and girls may be expected to increase with age. The interests and activities of boys and girls have been shown to differ as they enter adolescence. In general, boys prefer group and competitive activities, while girls seek more intimate, cooperative activities involving just two\npeople (Berndt & Savin-Williams, 1992). Girls also tend to desist in the use of physical aggression at a younger age than boys and turn to more subtle forms of\nsocial influence as they approach puberty (Xie, Cairns, & Cairns, 1999).\nHousehold income. There was a consistent relationship between income and social skills ratings. Table 111-5 shows that ratings of assertion, self-control, and cooperation were higher among higher income groups. Children from upper income households (more than $50,000/year) were described by their parents as highly assertive, while teachers identified students from those homes as having good cooperation skills. Increases from one income level to the next were reliable across the three social skills areas.\nRace/ethnicity. Levels of agreement varied between parents and teachers in\nweighted estimates of social skills based on race or ethnicity. Table 111-5 shows that parents of White, African American, Hispanic, and Asian students rated 85% to 90% of their children in the medium to high range for overall social skills. Teachers gave\nsimilar ratings to White and Hispanic students. Teachers identified 94% of\nAsian/Pacific Islander students as having medium to high social skills. Parents gave Asian/Pacific Islander youth lower ratings than those given by teachers for selfcontrol and cooperation.\n\n175\n\nIII-25\n\n\fTable 111-5\nStudents' Social Skills, by Income and Race/Ethnicity\n\nPercentage with overall social skills rated:\n\nHigh\n\nTeacher\n\nParent\n\nMedium Teacher\n\nParent\n\nLow\n\nTeacher\n\nParent\n\nPercentage with assertion skills rated:\n\nHigh\n\nTeacher\n\nParent\n\nMedium Teacher\n\nParent\n\nLow\n\nTeacher\n\nParent\n\nPercentage with self-control skills rated:\n\nHigh\n\nTeacher\n\nParent\n\nMedium Teacher\n\nParent\n\nLow\n\nTeacher\n\nParent\n\nPercentage with cooperation skills rated:\n\nHigh\n\nTeacher\n\nParent\n\nMedium Teacher\n\nParent\n\nLow\n\nTeacher\n\nParent\n\nSample size-Teacher\n\nSample size-Parent\n\nSource: SEF.I.S.\n\nIncome\n\n<=\n$25,000\n\n$25,001 to More than\n\n$50,000\n\n$50,000\n\n13.0\n\n22.4\n\n30.1\n\n13.9\n\n21.9\n\n27.2\n\n61.8\n\n61.8\n\n56.9\n\n70.0\n\n67.0\n\n67.0\n\n25.1\n\n15.8\n\n13.0\n\n16.1\n\n11.0\n\n5.8\n\n17.6\n\n22.7\n\n26.7\n\n23.4\n\n35.2\n\n42.4\n\n70.3\n\n65.3\n\n63.1\n\n66.8\n\n57.9\n\n52.6\n\n12.2\n\n12.0\n\n10.2\n\n9.8\n\n6.9\n\n5.0\n\n10.3\n\n17.9\n\n23.2\n\n12.7\n\n19.3\n\n23.1\n\n62.2\n\n67.2\n\n64.3\n\n71.5\n\n71.1\n\n71.6\n\n27.5\n\n15.0\n\n12.6\n\n15.8\n\n9.5\n\n5.3\n\n14.6 17.1 66.5 64.2 18.9 18.8 1,451 1,446\n\n17.8 15.2 67.7 72.5 14.5 12.3 1,238 1,233\n\n29.1 16.4 61.9 77.2 9.0 6.4 1,502 1,495\n\nWhite\n23.9 21.7 60.5 66.8 15.6 11.5\n22.8 36.7 66.6 57.2 10.6\n6.1\n18.6 18.7 65.3 70.3 16.1 11.0\n22.5 14.2 64.4 73.8 13.1 12.1 3,688 3,021\n\nRace/ethnicity\n\nAfrican American Hispanic\n\nAsian/ Pacific Islander\n\nAmerican Indian/ Alaska Native\n\n13.2\n\n17.1\n\n5.6\n\n5.5\n\n16.2\n\n14.9\n\n7.8\n\n57.7\n\n61.4\n\n65.3\n\n88.7\n\n57.2\n\n71.9\n\n75.1\n\n77.0\n\n39.0\n\n25.4\n\n17.6\n\n5.7\n\n37.3\n\n11.9\n\n10.0\n\n15.2\n\n3.3\n\n22.0\n\n22.7\n\n13.3\n\n1.2\n\n28.8\n\n23.8\n\n11.3\n\n74.3\n\n64.9\n\n66.1\n\n75.6\n\n89.6\n\n65.7\n\n59.0\n\n82.5\n\n22.6\n\n13.1\n\n11.2\n\n11.1\n\n9.2\n\n5.5\n\n17.3\n\n6.2\n\n3.1\n\n5.1\n\n18.8\n\n15.4\n\n5.8\n\n13.3\n\n17.2\n\n11.7\n\n12.1\n\n66.6\n\n62.4\n\n78.4\n\n59.2\n\n74.6\n\n73.8\n\n75.0\n\n78.0\n\n28.3\n\n18.8\n\n6.2\n\n35.0\n\n12.1\n\n9.0\n\n13.3\n\n9.9\n\n13.3\n\n16.7\n\n7.1\n\n2.0\n\n18.2\n\n21.3\n\n13.5\n\n12.6\n\n64.4\n\n70.0\n\n84.8\n\n64.4\n\n65.7\n\n63.6\n\n68.3\n\n81.1\n\n22.3\n\n13.3\n\n8.2\n\n33.6\n\n16.1\n\n15.1\n\n18.2\n\n6.3\n\n1,060\n\n660\n\n95\n\n41\n\n789\n\n514\n\n76\n\n31\n\n\fSocial Adaptation and Problem Behaviors of Elementary and Middle School Students Receiving Special Education\n\nAmerican youth were even greater. Parents of American Indians and Alaska Natives said that 97% of their children had medium to high social skills. Teachers gave that rating to only 63% of the same group.\nThe race/ethnicity data reported here were weighted to be nationally representative. However, caution is required when considering ethnic and racial differences on rating scales. There may have been real ethnic/racial differences in social skills among children. But there also may have been differences in interpretation of the questions, or there may have been cultural differences related to the importance or relevance of a particular domain. For example, it may be that White parents placed less emphasis on cooperation than they did on assertion or self-control, compared\nwith African American or Hispanic parents. In addition, the sample included\nrelatively few American Indian/Alaska Native students.\nProblem Behaviors and Disciplinary Actions\nThe preceding discussion illustrates the diversity of social skills that students with disabilities bring to the educational setting and process. It is also noteworthy that the majority of students with disabilities received medium to high ratings from teachers and parents on measures of cooperation, assertion, and self-control. However, there is still significant interest among policymakers, teachers, and parents in the degree to which students with disabilities exhibit \"problem behaviors\" (GAO, 2001; Leone, Mayer, Malmgren, & Meisel, 2000; Katsiyannis & Moog, 1998).\nSEELS' approach to the measurement of problem behavior is guided by the\nconceptual framework of the Social Skills Rating System (SSRS), which organizes problem behavior into three distinct categories: hyperactivity, internalizing, and externalizing (Gresham & Elliott, 1990). Below we present teacher ratings of students with disabilities in these three categories, as well as parent reports of disciplinary actions imposed on students with disabilities. Parents did not rate problem behaviors.2\nHjperactivi6 / Problem Behaviors\nThe ability to concentrate and persist in a learning activity for an extended period of time is a common requirement of virtually all approaches to teaching and learning. Hyperactivity is a class of problem behaviors that interfere with this essential\n\n2 Due to parental discomfort in responding to these items, they were discontinued to preserve the integrity of other parental responses and high levels of parental participation.\n\n177\n\nIII-27\n\n\f24111 Annual Report to Congress\nprocess. Such problem behaviors include excessive physical movements and\ndifficulty in concentrating, listening to instructions, paying attention, staying on task, or completing activities. In each case, students who exhibit such behaviors are at risk for missing key components of instruction, whether in the context of individual or group work, which can limit their ability to learn and succeed. Of course, many of\nthese behaviors are now associated with attention deficit disorder (ADD) and\nADHD, which are included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Pgchiatric Association (DSM-IV, American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Some students diagnosed with these disorders receive educational services under Section\n504 or IDEA in the category of other health impairment or other disability categories. Attention deficits and hyperactivity are increasingly recognized as\nproblems faced by American school children, and many students may exhibit some\nlevel of hyperactivity, even if they are not identified to receive services for\nhyperactivity. Figure 111-4 shows that characteristics of hyperactivity are indeed quite common among students with disabilities. Nearly 40% of elementary and middle\nschool students with disabilities were reported by their teachers to be \"easily distracted\" on a frequent basis. Similarly, 25% were reported to frequently \"act impulsively.\" Direct comparisons to the general population of students are not available. Nonetheless, this suggests that problems resulting from distractibility and/or impulsivity may affect the learning of many students with disabilities, regardless of their primary disability designation, which also suggests that interventions focused on hyperactivity should be considered in developing their\neducational programming.\nInternalizing Problem Behaviors\nNot every problem behavior that adversely affects student functioning is attentiongetting, easily or frequently observed, or directly affects other students in class or school settings. Problem behaviors that primarily affect the individual student are referred to as internalizing problem behaviors. Examples of such behaviors are loneliness, depression, and chronic sadness. Because these behaviors may not disrupt classroom activities, or other students, they may not be noticed by school staff or receive attention. In the long run, internalizing behaviors interfere with learning and social development and thus can be just as limiting as other types of problem behaviors. For example, children who are lonely as students are at risk for loneliness, social isolation, or rejection as adults (Asher, Hymel, & Renshaw, 1984). Other internalizing behaviors, such as extreme shyness, anxieties, and phobias, may inhibit the student's ability to function in social situations or cause a child to behave in ways that are perceived as odd, selfish, or arrogant. Behaviors perceived as odd and/or avoidant can set the stage for lasting difficulties in social adaptation. Figure 111-4 shows that 10% of elementary and middle school students with disabilities nationally were reported to be \"lonely\" on a frequent basis. Seven percent were reported by\n\nIII-28\n\n1 78\n\n\fSocial Adaptation and Problem Behaviors of Elementary and Middle School Students Receiving Special Education\nFigure 111-4\nTeacher Reports of Problem Behaviors, Suspensions, and Expulsions Among Students Receiving Special Education\n\nFights with others very often\n\n16.90\n\nArgues with others very often\n\n112.90\n\nAppears lonely very often\n\n19.80\n\nActs sad or depressed very often\n\n16.80\n\nGets easily distracted very often\n\n138.60\n\nActs impulsively very often\n\n125.10\n\nEver suspended or expelled\n\n113.90\n\nSuspended this year\n\n7.60\n\nExpelled this year 0.90\n\n0.00 5.00 10.00 15.00 20.00 25.00 30.00 35.00 40.00 45.00\nPercent\n\ntheir teachers to be frequently \"sad.\" While far less common than problems related to hyperactivity, internalizing problem behaviors affect a significant number of students with disabilities.\n\nExternalizing Problem Behaviors\nExternalizing problem behaviors are those that are most observable and receive the greatest amount of attention from school personnel and the general public. This is because externalizing problem behaviors often present the greatest immediate risk for an individual student, as well as to others in the class or the school. Examples of externalizing problem behaviors include fighting, threatening, defiance, bullying, excessive anger, arguing, theft, vandalism, or drug use. Some externalizing behaviors are considered generally disruptive to the educational process and may lead to referral for special education services, particularly if they are indicative of emotional\n\nEST COPY AVAILABLE\n\n179\n\nIII-29\n\n\f24th Annual Report to Congress\n\ndisturbance. Other types of externalizing behaviors refer to specific incidents or patterns of incidents that lead to disciplinary actions (discussed below). Over the long term, externalizing problem behaviors are linked to a range of undesirable outcomes such as social maladjustment, school failure, school dropout, and even incarceration. Figure 111-4 shows that externalizing problem behaviors are relatively uncommon. Thirteen percent of students with disabilities in elementary and middle school were reported by their teachers to frequently \"argue with others,\" and 7% were reported to frequently \"fight with others.\" While not a common characteristic among students with disabilities, externalizing problem behaviors remain an important issue because of their disruptive potential.\nDisruptive conduct takes on added significance when coupled with low academic achievement. Poor school performance together with high levels of externalizing behavior and aggressiveness are strongly related to school dropout and other negative outcomes. Cairns and Cairns (1994) identified a group of children who were extremely disruptive and performing poorly in the seventh grade. Eighty-two percent of the males in that group failed to complete the 11th grade. Boys who were extreme on one dimension but not on the other (i.e., high aggression or low academic performance) were much more likely to stay in school than those who exhibited both characteristics. These authors emphasize that it is the configuration of characteristics (i.e., low school performance plus aggressive behavior), and not single variables (e.g., socioeconomic status or popularity) that lend predictive power to analyses of social behavior.\nDisciplinary Actions\nEffective behavior management is considered an essential ingredient of effective schools and teaching, but it is a challenge for many American schools (Bos & Vaughn, 1994; Leone et al., 2000). The characteristics of effective behavior management include a school-wide approach with clear expectations, policies, and behavior management practices. In the classroom, teachers use a variety of approaches to direct and shape behavior, such as classroom rules, token economies, and seating arrangements (Epanchin, Townsend, & Stoddard, 1994; Kameenui & Darch, 1995; Walker & Homer, 1996; Woolery, Bailey, & Sugai, 1988). When incidents occur outside the classroom, misconduct can be addressed through parent conferences, behavior contracts, functional behavioral assessments, and behavior management plans. However, in cases where events or behaviors are considered serious violations, schools use the mechanisms of \"in school\" and \"out of school\" suspensions to seek improved behavior. In cases of extreme violations, schools expel students. In the case of students with disabilities, there has been a long-standing tension between the school's efforts to maintain school safety and discipline and the student's right to appropriate, free public education under IDEA. In general, IDEA limits the use of suspensions to 10 consecutive days in a school year. To exceed the\n\nIII-30\n\n180\n\n\fSocial Adaptation and Problem Behaviors of Elementary and Middle School Students Receiving Special Education\n10-day suspension limit, an IEP team meeting must first be held to determine if the\nbehavior was disability related, and an evaluation of any proposed change in\nplacement must be conducted.\nAccording to parents, 14% of students with disabilities in elementary and middle school had been expelled or suspended at some point in their school careers. In addition, 8% had been suspended during the most recent school year. The U.S. General Accounting Office (2001) reports that special education students have more than three times the number of serious misconduct incidents per 1,000 students than the proportion reported for students in general education. Most of the students who engage in serious misconduct face out-of-school suspension (GAO, 2001).\nDifferences in Problem Behaviors and Disciplinaiy Actions by DisabiliOT Categoly\nTable 111-6 depicts teacher ratings of problem behaviors by student disability category. There is diversity across disability categories, and a number of students in each category are reported to engage in each of the problem behaviors in the \"very often\" category. However, it is reasonable to expect problem behaviors to be more common among students whose disabilities include behavior as a diagnostic and eligibility criterion. Table 111-6 illustrates that students with ED indeed stand out in comparison to peers with other disabilities. While this general relationship is not surprising, the magnitude is cause for concern. Students with ED were reported more likely to frequently engage in externalizing problem behaviors (fighting-24%, arguing-40%) than other students. By contrast, fewer than 10% of students in all other disability categories were reported to \"fight with others\" frequently, and fewer than 18% were reported to frequently \"argue with others.\" This is consistent with the association of such externalizing behavior with ED. However, students with ED also stand apart from their peers in both internalizing and hyperactivity problem behaviors. For example, 18% of students with ED were reported to be \"lonely\" or \"sad and depressed.\" Rates for these behaviors were lower for students in all other categories. For example, reports of frequent \"sadness or depression\" ranged from 8% (students with multiple disabilities) to 3% (students with visual impairments). A similar pattern is evident among hyperactivity-related problem behaviors: 60% of students with ED were reported to be \"easily distracted\" on a frequent basis, and 50% were reported to frequently \"act impulsively.\" Students with autism were reported to have similar rates of hyperactivity-related problem behaviors. Rates for students in other disability categories were also high, ranging from 27% to 40% for \"distractibility\" and 19% to 30% for \"impulsivity.\" This illustrates that problem behaviors of all types affect students across the disability spectrum, but that they are\n181\n\n\fTable 111-6\nTeacher Ratings of Problem Behaviors, by Disability Category\n\nFights with others Never Sometimes Very Often\n\nSpecific learning disability\n\nSpeech/\n\nOther\n\nlanguage\n\nMental Emotional Hearing\n\nVisual Orthopedic health\n\nimpairment retardation disturbance impairment impairment impairment impairment\n\n55.5\n\n62.0\n\n47.7\n\n21.5\n\n59.2\n\n57.2\n\n69.6\n\n53.5\n\n39.4\n\n32.6\n\n43.9\n\n55.0\n\n35.2\n\n38.0\n\n25.0\n\n37.9\n\n5.1\n\n5.5\n\n8.4\n\n23.5\n\n5.6\n\n4.8\n\n5.4\n\n8.6\n\nArgues with others Never Sometimes Very Often\n\n36.6\n\n44.2\n\n28.8\n\n11.0\n\n36.2\n\n41.0\n\n48.6\n\n35.6\n\n51.8\n\n47.4\n\n54.2\n\n48.8\n\n53.8\n\n48.7\n\n38.9\n\n50.2\n\n11.6\n\n8.4\n\n17.0\n\n40.2\n\n9.9\n\n10.3\n\n12.5\n\n14.2\n\nAppears lonely Never Sometimes Very Often\n\n56.2\n\n56.4\n\n46.4\n\n28.2\n\n50.2\n\n49.0\n\n51.4\n\n39.7\n\n34.8\n\n34.5\n\n44.5\n\n53.5\n\n42.7\n\n43.9\n\n39.4\n\n47.7\n\n9.0\n\n9.1\n\n9.1\n\n18.3\n\n7.1\n\n7.1\n\n9.1\n\n12.6\n\nActs sad or depressed Never Sometimes Very Often\n\n58.2\n\n60.6\n\n46.2\n\n23.7\n\n54.4\n\n57.8\n\n54.9\n\n47.0\n\n36.1\n\n33.0\n\n46.8\n\n58.2\n\n41.7\n\n39.2\n\n41.5\n\n45.9\n\n5.8\n\n6.4\n\n7.0\n\n18.1\n\n3.9\n\n3.0\n\n3.6\n\n7.1\n\nGets easily distracted Never Sometimes Very Often\n\n8.2\n\n17.1\n\n5.1\n\n3.1\n\n16.2\n\n18.9\n\n13.1\n\n6.4\n\n53.3\n\n54.8\n\n46.0\n\n37.4\n\n50.8\n\n53.9\n\n46.1\n\n41.4\n\n38.6\n\n28.1\n\n48.9\n\n59.5\n\n32.9\n\n27.2\n\n40.9\n\n52.1\n\nActs impulsively\n\nNever\n\n34.9\n\n41.9\n\n23.3\n\n12.6\n\n38.6\n\n35.2\n\n37.8\n\n24.0\n\nSometimes\n\n42.4\n\n38.7\n\n44.5\n\n37.9\n\n37.7\n\n44.2\n\n42.0\n\n45.2\n\nVery Often\n\n22.6\n\n19.5\n\n32.2\n\n49.5\n\n23.7\n\n20.6\n\n20.2\n\n30.8\n\nUnweighted N 664\n\n550\n\n588\n\n496\n\n511\n\n428\n\n563\n\n457\n\nAutism\n57.0 37.1 6.0\n39.6 49.8 10.6\n42.4 43.8 13.8\n46.1 50.9\n3.1\n2.2 35.1 62.7\n14.4 40.5 45.2 646\n\nTraumatic Multiple\n\nDeaf-\n\nbrain injury disabilities blindness\n\n54.8\n\n47.2\n\n100.0\n\n36.0\n\n44.3\n\n9.2\n\n8.5\n\n37.2\n\n34.1\n\n58.4\n\n49.6\n\n51.8\n\n28.2\n\n13.3\n\n14.1\n\n13.3\n\n43.1\n\n48.2\n\n59.4\n\n50.6\n\n43.5\n\n28.8\n\n6.4\n\n8.3\n\n11.9\n\n46.4\n\n44.4\n\n56.3\n\n47.1\n\n47.8\n\n43.7\n\n6.5\n\n7.8\n\n0\n\n10.3\n\n2.9\n\n13.5\n\n41.9\n\n38.4\n\n43.1\n\n47.8\n\n58.8\n\n43.5\n\n25.6\n\n21.3\n\n59.9\n\n34.2\n\n39.4\n\n17.4\n\n40.2\n\n39.3\n\n22.7\n\n207\n\n392\n\n13\n\n\fSocial Adaptation and Problem Behaviors of Elementary and Middle School Students Receiving Special Education\nparticularly acute for students with ED. This is expected since the criteria for ED include these types of behaviors and stipulate that the student's impairment must not be due to other factors (see 34 CFR 300.7).\nTable 111-7 reveals a similar pattern of parent reports of disciplinary actions by student disability. While students in all categories are suspended, students with ED are suspended far more frequently. For example, nearly 50% of students with ED in elementary and middle school had been suspended or expelled at some time in their school careers. Students with learning disabilities (16%), mental retardation (17%), other health impairments (17%) and traumatic brain injuries (15%) all had been suspended at rates above the general population but still far below that of peers with emotional disturbance. Similarly, nearly 31% of students with ED were reported to have been suspended in their most recent school yearnearly three times the rates of the next most common category (other health impairments).\nIt is important to evaluate the long-term effects of these disciplinary actions in the domains of achievement, social development, and school completion. SEELS, as well as other OSEP longitudinal studies, will be able to provide information to address this important question.\nDifferences in Problem Behaviors and Disciplinaly Actions by Demographics\nAge. Several trends emerge in preliminary analyses across age groups (see Tables III8 and 111-9). It appears that externalizing behaviors, such as fighting and arguing, increase with age, while internalizing behaviors, such as feeling lonely or sad, decline somewhat across age groups. Somewhat surprisingly, distractibility appears to\nincrease with age. Age has a clear impact on suspensions and expulsions, with substantial increases observed on these measures based on age of the student. Two caveats need to be kept in mind about these analyses. First, the data are crosssectional and not longitudinal. To clearly establish age trends and to identify the persistence of conduct over time, sequential data are required. SEELS is designed to provide such data, which will be available in later reports. Second, there are potential differences in the age at which students are identified for special education, and youth with behavioral problems (ED) as a primary diagnosis tend to be older than children with other disabilities. It will be interesting to follow these students into adolescence and explore further the relationship of age to social functioning and\nproblem behaviors.\n\n183\n\nBI-33\n\n\fTable 111-7\nParent Reports of Suspensions and Expulsions, by Disability Category\n\nEver Suspended/expelled Unweighted N\n\nSpecific learning disability\n15.5\n1,041\n\nSuspended this year\n\n8.1\n\nUnweighted N 1,004\n\nExpelled this year\n\n0.7\n\nUnweighted N 1,033\n\nSpeech/ language impairment\n5.3 831\n2.4 818\n0.4 829\n\nOther\n\nMental Emotional Hearing\n\nVisual Orthopedic health\n\nretardation disturbance impairment impairment impairment impairment\n\n16.9\n\n48.6\n\n7.9\n\n4.7\n\n6.5\n\n17.2\n\n858\n\n858\n\n1,019\n\n802\n\n977\n\n922\n\n10.2\n\n30.6\n\n4.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n12.1\n\n827\n\n779\n\n1,001\n\n796\n\n963\n\n918\n\n1.8\n\n3.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.7\n\n1.3\n\n850\n\n840\n\n1,016\n\n801\n\n972\n\n921\n\nSource: SEELS.\n\nAutism 6.7\n1,096\n4.7 1,095\n0.6 1,095\n\nTraumatic brain injury\n15.4 359\n\nMultiple disabilities\n13.8\n837\n\n9.6\n\n9.0\n\n352\n\n836\n\n0.8\n\n1.1\n\n359\n\n837\n\nDeafblindness\n3.8 49\n3.8 49\n0.0 49\n\n\fSocial Adaptation and Problem Behaviors of Elementary and Middle School Students Receiving Special Education\n\nTable 111-8\nTeacher Ratings of Problem Behaviors, by Age and Gender\n\nFights with others Never\nSometimes Very Often\nArgues with others Never Sometimes Very Often\nAppears lonely Never Sometimes Very Often\nActs sad or depressed Never\nSometimes Very Often\nGets easily distracted Never\nSometimes Very Often\nActs impulsively Never Sometimes Very Often Unweighted N\n\nAge\n\n6 to 9\n\n10 to 12\n\n55.6\n\n54.2\n\n37.4\n\n39.2\n\n7.1\n\n6.6\n\nGender\n\nMale\n\nFemale\n\n52.2\n\n62.3\n\n40.3\n\n32.6\n\n7.5\n\n5.1\n\n38.3\n\n35.5\n\n36.0\n\n40.7\n\n49.9\n\n50.9\n\n49.0\n\n50.4\n\n11.8\n\n13.6\n\n15.0\n\n8.9\n\n53.9\n\n50.8\n\n53.6\n\n50.1\n\n36.8\n\n38.6\n\n35.9\n\n41.6\n\n9.4\n\n10.7\n\n10.5\n\n8.3\n\n55.3\n\n53.8\n\n57.1\n\n49.2\n\n38.1\n\n39.1\n\n35.7\n\n44.5\n\n6.7\n\n7.2\n\n7.2\n\n6.3\n\n11.5\n\n9.6\n\n8.1\n\n15.1\n\n49.6\n\n52.4\n\n47.9\n\n56.2\n\n38.9\n\n38.0\n\n44.0\n\n28.7\n\n34.4 39.9 25.7 3,036\n\n33.6\n\n27.4\n\n42.4\n\n43.3\n\n23.9\n\n29.3\n\n2,304 I 2,887\n\n46.2 37.8 15.9 1,489\n\nGender. Gender is an important variable in social behavior and development. It is related both to the types and frequencies of behaviors exhibited at particular\ndevelopment stages. Importantly, there is evidence of different behavioral\nexpectations for boys and girls. In regard to problem behaviors, previous research suggests that males are more likely to engage in externalizing and hyperactivityrelated problem behaviors, while girls are more likely to be \"sad or depressed\" (Clark, Hanno, & Kellam, 2000; Morgan, 1991; Ruble & Martin, 1998; Versi, 1995). Table 111-8 generally suggests that this pattern applies to students with disabilities as well. However, the differences are not as large as one might expect. While boys are more likely to often \"argue with others\" and to \"fight with others,\" the differences\nare modest.\n\nBEST COPY AVAILABLE\n\n185\n\nIII-35\n\n\f24\" Annual Report to Congress\n\nTable 111-9\nParent Ratings of Suspensions and Expulsions, by Age and Gender\n\nEver Suspended/expelled\nUnweighted N\nSuspended this year\nUnweighted N\nExpelled this year\nUnweighted N\n\nAp\n\n6 to 9\n\n10 to 12\n\n6.7 2,493\n\n16.6 1,900\n\n3.5 2,474\n\n10.3 1,844\n\n.1\n2,490\n\n1.4 1,887\n\nSource: SEELS.\n\nGender\n\nMale\n\nFemale\n\n17.7 6,290\n\n6.0 3,237\n\n10.0 6,129\n\n3.3 3,211\n\n1.0 6,249\n\n0.7 3,235\n\nHousehold income. Education-related research frequently finds that family background, particularly socioeconomic status, is related to a host of important outcomes such as achievement, school completion, etc. (Cairns & Cairns, 1994). Child health, family stability, in-home support for learning, high expectations, and the stresses of poverty are among the reasons cited for these findings. Table III-10\nshows that this relationship applies for all three categories of problem behaviors, as well as for disciplinary actions. For example, students from families with incomes of less than $25,000 were significantly more likely \"to fight with others\" frequently (11% vs. 3%) and \"to argue with others\" (18% vs. 10%) in comparison to peers from families whose incomes exceeded $50,000. The income pattern also applies to \"loneliness,\" \"distractibility,\" and \"impulsivity.\" The size of this discrepancy is even\nlarger in reported disciplinary actions. Twenty-one percent of students with\ndisabilities from lower income households had been suspended or expelled at some point in their school careers, compared to just 7% of students from higher income\nhouseholds.\n\nRace/ethnicity. Student ethnic background has been an important policy issue in special education for decades. These debates have focused on a number of issues, including the overrepresentation of minority students in specific disability categories, validity of assessments, culturally sensitive and informed instruction, as well as differences in outcomes achieved across ethnic groups. Table III-10 illustrates that there is considerable variation in reports of problem behaviors across ethnic groups. African American students and Native American students were reported to engage more frequently in externalizing and hyperactivity-related problem behaviors. For example, 13% of African American students with disabilities were reported \"to fight with others\" frequently in comparison to 0.5% of Asian students and 5% of Hispanic students. There are also significant differences in the rates at which students from different ethnic groups receive disciplinary actions, according to their\n\n1 6\n\n\fTable III-10 Teacher Ratings of Problem Behaviors, Suspensions, and Expulsions, by Income and Ethnicity\n\nIncome\n\nFights with others Never\nSometimes Very Often Argues with others Never Sometimes Very Often\nAppears lonely Never Sometimes Very Often\nActs sad or depressed Never\nSometimes Very Often Gets easily distracted Never Sometimes Very Often Acts impulsively Never Sometimes Very Often\nEver Suspended/expelled\nSuspended this year\nExpelled this year\n\n<=\n$25,000\n42.4 47.1 10.5\n\n27.0 54.6 18.4\n\n45.6 44.2 10.1\n\n44.9 45.7\n9.4\n\n7.4 46.5 46.1\n\nUnweighted N Unweighted N Unweighted N Unweighted N,\n\n29.6 38.0 32.4 1,417 21.1 3,439 10.9 3,326\n1.6 3,412\n\nSource: SEELS.\n\n$25,001 to $50,000 > $50,000\n\n58.8\n\n66.9\n\n36.9\n\n29.6\n\n4.3\n\n3.4\n\n41.3\n\n47.2\n\n49.0\n\n43.3\n\n9.7\n\n9.5\n\n54.0\n\n57.7\n\n33.8\n\n34.9\n\n12.2\n\n7.4\n\n57.8\n\n62.2\n\n35.6\n\n35.4\n\n6.6\n\n2.4\n\n10.3\n\n16.2\n\n50.7\n\n53.2\n\n39.0\n\n30.6\n\n38.2 40.0 21.8 1,199\n9.5 2,449\n7.5 2,447\n0.3 2,448\n\n38.0 43.5 18.5 1,461\n6.7 2,972\n4.4 2,944\n0.5 2,969\n\nWhite\n59.2 35.3 5.6\n40.8 48.5 10.8\n52.6 37.5\n9.9\n57.7 36.5\n5.8\n11.6 52.2 36.3\n35.0 42.4 22.6 3,596 10.0 6,043\n5.5 5,921\n0.5 6,013\n\nRace/ethnicity\n\nAfrican American\n\nHispanic\n\nAsian/ Pacific Islander\n\n40.0\n\n57.7\n\n56.3\n\n47.3\n\n36.9\n\n43.1\n\n12.7\n\n5.3\n\n0.5\n\nAmerican Indian/ Alaska Native\n42.5 45.2 12.3\n\n19.7\n\n43.2\n\n50.6\n\n32.3\n\n58.6\n\n47.4\n\n45.6\n\n45.6\n\n21.7\n\n9.4\n\n3.8\n\n22.1\n\n51.9\n\n55.0\n\n34.4\n\n61.4\n\n36.8\n\n39.1\n\n52.2\n\n33.6\n\n11.3\n\n5.9\n\n13.5\n\n5.0\n\n45.1\n\n57.3\n\n23.5\n\n57.9\n\n45.4\n\n36.1\n\n65.7\n\n35.5\n\n9.5\n\n6.6\n\n10.9\n\n6.6\n\n4.9\n\n13.1\n\n10.8\n\n6.1\n\n46.7\n\n51.3\n\n62.7\n\n49.1\n\n48.3\n\n35.7\n\n26.5\n\n44.7\n\n24.3\n\n42.9\n\n20.5\n\n28.2\n\n41.8\n\n32.1\n\n64.8\n\n41.6\n\n33.9\n\n25.0\n\n14.7\n\n30.1\n\n1,025\n\n636\n\n94\n\n41\n\n28.1\n\n12.5\n\n0.6\n\n21.9\n\n2,035\n\n1,205\n\n205\n\n61\n\n15.9\n\n7.0\n\n0.3\n\n2.6\n\n1,969\n\n1,186\n\n205\n\n58\n\n2.4\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n2,020\n\n1,204\n\n205\n\n60\n\n\f2411' Annual Report to Congress\nteachers. For example, 28% of African American elementary and middle school students with disabilities had been suspended or expelled at some point during their school careers, and 16% had been suspended in their most recent school year. These rates are significantly higher than those for White students (10%), Hispanic students (13%), and Asian students (0.6%). Unfortunately, SEELS does not have data on the specific reasons for these disciplinary actions, which would allow further evaluation of these numbers. However, the finding of highly elevated suspension rates parallels reports for African American students in the general population (NCES, 1997).\nConclusion\nSocial development is a key outcome for many students with disabilities, and\nconcerns about school safety and discipline generally have been increasing in recent years. Parent and teacher reports on social adjustment and problem behaviors from SEELS Wave 1 illustrate considerable diversity of these complex phenomena. Teachers and parents concur that the majority of students with disabilities have average to above average social skills. However, many students with disabilities also engage in problem behaviors, particularly related to hyperactivity. Attention-getting, problem-externalizing behaviors were relatively uncommon for students with disabilities as a whole, but these behaviors were more commonly reported for African American students, students with ED, or those with lower family incomes. These students were also far more likely than other students with disabilities to receive disciplinary actions such as suspensions. While generally consistent with other reports, the size of the discrepancy in disciplinary actions between students with ED and other students with disabilities was unexpectedly large and represents elevated risk for poor outcomes as these students mature. It will be particularly informative to learn about the continued social development of SEELS students as they enter middle and high school and to explore the relationship of prosocial and problem behavior to other indices of student success.\n\nIII-38\n\n1 88\n\n\fSocial Adaptation and Problem Behaviors of Elementary and Middle School Students Receiving Special Education\nReferences\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.

The Act requires that \"to the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities . . . are educated with children who are not disabled; and . . . removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only when the\nnature or severity of the disability of a child is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily\" (\u00a7612(a)(5)(A)). This goal has been accomplished in part by the continuum of placements available to students with disabilities. These provisions for LRE and a continuum of placements are sometimes a source of contention among parents and educators.\nStudents with disabilities receive services in a variety of educational settings. While some students spend the majority of the school day in regular education classrooms with their nondisabled peers, others are served in separate classrooms or facilities that serve only students with disabilities. Some advocacy organizations, such as the\nAssociation for Persons With Severe Handicaps (TASH) and Schools Are For Everyone (SAFE), advocate serving all children with disabilities in the regular\nclassroom. Others, including the Council for Exceptional Children and the Learning Disabilities Association of America, encourage schools to provide a continuum of placements. For example, \"many leaders in the field of serious emotional disturbance recommend a full continuum of services to help students who exhibit violent or\naggressive behaviors\" (The Discipline Problem, 2001).\nAdvocates often suggest that students with a wide range of disabilities, not just those with behavior problems, may benefit from separate classrooms or facilities. For example, some advocacy groups within the deaf community have expressed concerns\nabout whether a fully inclusive classroom in a public school is truly the most appropriate setting for students who have hearing impairments. Their rationale is that the distinct cultural aspects of being educated in separate schools with similar students may offer more benefits than classrooms with nondisabled peers. A study of deaf students suggests that these students benefit from exposure to both types of environments (Wilson, 1997). Research also suggests that a combination of service environments may be beneficial to students with other types of disabilities. For example, Marston (1996) found greater increases in reading achievement among students who received services in both an inclusive classroom and a resource room,\ncompared to students served exclusively in one setting or the other.\nIII-43\n192\n\n\f241! Annual Report to Congress\nThis module presents state-reported data on the educational environments in which students receive services and examines the extent to which students with disabilities are educated in settings with their nondisabled peers. The module will explore trends and factors associated with different educational placements, such as age, race or ethnicity, and disability category.\nTrends in the Data\nIn 1999-2000, 95.9% of students with disabilities were served in regular school buildings; of those students, 47.3% were served outside of the regular classroom for less than 21% of the school day. Approximately 3% of students were served in separate facilities; 0.7% of students were served in residential facilities; and 0.5% of students were served in home or hospital settings (see Table AB2). Between 1990-91 and 1999-2000, the number of students receiving special education and related services rose 29.8%. During the same period, the percentage change within each educational environment has varied considerably. The number of students served outside of the regular classroom for less than 21% of the school day increased 87.1%, while the number of students served in public separate facilities and public residential facilities decreased 15.3% and 10.1%, respectively, suggesting a trend toward inclusive environments.\nFactors Associated With Different Educational Environments\nAge\nWhile progress in serving students in less restrictive settings has continued across all age groups, elementary-aged students are more likely than older students to be served in the regular classroom, with supplementary aids and support services. During the 1999-2000 school year, 56.8% of all students ages 6 through 11 were\nserved outside of the regular classroom for less than 21% of the school day, compared to 38.7% of students ages 12 through 17 and 32.6% of students ages 18 through 21. In some states and outlying areas, the disparity is more pronounced in\nother environments. For example, more than 20% of students ages 18 through 21 in Michigan, Minnesota, and Utah are served in separate public facilities. In these same states, less than 7% of students ages 6 through 11 and students ages 12 through 17 are served in such environments (see Tables AB3, AB4, and AB5).\n\nIII-44\n\n193\n\n\fEducational Environments for Students With Disabilities\n\nTable III-11\nPercentage of Students Ages 6 Through 21 With Disabilities by Race/ Ethnicity Served in Different Educational Environments: 1999-2000\n\nServed outside the regular class <21% of the day 21 to 60% of the day >60% of the day Separate school Residential facility Home/hospital\n\nAmerican Indian/ Alaska Native\n47.8\n33.6\n15.7\n1.8\n0.8\n0.4\n\nAsian/ Pacific Islander\n46.7 26.5 22.1\n4.1 0.5 0.5\n\nBlack 35.3 28.4 31.0\n3.8 1.0 0.5\n\nHispanic\n41.1 28.5 26.9\n2.5 0.5 0.6\n\nWhite 52.9 28.0 15.3\n2.8 0.6 0.5\n\nSource: U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education Programs, Data Analysis System (DANS).\n\nRace/Ethnicity\n\nDuring the 1998-99 school year, the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) required states and outlying areas to collect data on educational environments by race/ethnicity for the first time. From 1998-99 to 1999-2000, the percentage of\nstudents of various racial and ethnic backgrounds served within each environment remained constant. Fifty-three percent of White students, 41.1% of Hispanic students, 35.3% of Black students, 46.7% of Asian or Pacific Islander students, and\n\n47.8% of American Indian or Alaska Native students were served outside the regular\n\nclassroom less than 21% of the school day. Thirty-one percent of Black students\n\nwere served outside the regular classroom for more than 60% of the school day,\n\ncompared to 15.3% of White students and 26.9% of Hispanic students.\n\nApproximately 3% of American Indian or Alaska Native students were served\n\noutside of the regular school building (see Table III-11). It is possible that the\n\ndifferences in placement by race/ethnicity may reflect the disproportional\n\nrepresentation predominantly\n\nof some minority groups in disability categories that are served in more restrictive settings. Future examination of\n\nrace/ethnicity data in both child count and educational environments may provide\n\nmore information on this trend.\n\nAnother way to examine the data on educational environments by race/ethnicity is\nto compare the racial/ethnic distribution of students in each educational\nenvironment to the racial/ethnic distribution of all students with disabilities. Sixty-\ntwo percent of all students with disabilities are White (non-Hispanic), 20% are Black\n\n194\n\nIII-45\n\n\f24th Annual Report to Congress\n(non-Hispanic), 14.4% are Hispanic, 1.8% are Asian or Pacific Islander, and 1.4% are American Indian or Alaska Native (see Table AB10). While this distribution is similar to the racial/ethnic distribution of students served outside the regular classroom 21\nto 60% of the school day, the racial/ethnic distributions of other educational\nenvironments differ considerably.\nFor example, of the students served in parent-initiated private school placements, 81.6% were White, 9.8% were Black, 5.9% were Hispanic, 2.3% were Asian or Pacific Islander, and 0.3% were American Indian or Alaska Native. Forty-six percent of the students served in correctional facilities were Black, 35.4% were White, 15.4% were Hispanic, 1.6% were American Indian or Alaska Native, and 1.2% were Asian\nor Pacific Islander (see Table AB10).\nDisabilhy Categoiy\nThe number of students placed in particular educational environments continues to vary by disability category. Students with low-incidence disabilities are less likely to spend the majority of their school day in the regular classroom, while the majority of students with learning disabilities and speech language impairments are served in the regular classroom. In 1999-2000, 87.5% of students with speech or language impairments, 45.3% of students with specific learning disabilities, 25.8% of students with emotional disturbance, 14.1% of students with mental retardation, and 11.2% of students with multiple disabilities were served outside the regular classroom less than 21% of the school day (see Table AB2).\nThe percentage of students with a specific disability within each placement category can also be compared to their representation in the total population of students with disabilities. For example, although students with emotional disturbance represented 8.2% of all students with disabilities in 1999-2000, they represented 4.5% of students placed in the regular classroom and 32.9% of the students placed in public separate facilities (see Table 111-12). In contrast, the proportion of students with other health impairments in the total population of students with disabilities is reflected more consistently across the educational environments.\nI[I-46\n5\n\n\fEducational Environments for Students With Disabilities\n\nTable 111-12\nPercentage of Students Ages 6 Through 21 With Disabilities Served in Different Educational Environments: 1999-2000\n\n1999-2000 school year Served outside the regular class\n\nDisabilities Specific learning disabilities Speech or language impairments Mental retardation Emotional disturbance Multiple disabilities Hearing impairments Orthopedic impairment Other health impairments Visual impairments Autism Deaf-blindness Traumatic brain injury\n\nAll students\nwith disabilities\n50.4 19.2 10.8\n8.2 2.1 1.3 1.3 4.5 0.5 1.2 0.02 0.2\n\n<21% of the day\n48.3 35.5\n3.2 4.5 0.5 1.1 1.2 4.2 0.5 0.5 0.01 0.2\n\n21-60% of the day 67.4 4.6 11.3 6.8 1.4 0.9 1.0 5.2 0.3 0.6 0.01 0.2\n\n>60% of the day\n39.2 5.0\n26.9 13.3 4.5\n1.5 1.7 3.8 0.4 2.9 0.05 0.4\n\nPublic separate facility\n9.9 2.5 23.3 32.9 16.8 3.6 2.3 2.1 1.1 4.9 0.2 0.3\n\nSource: U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education Programs, Data\nAnalysis System (DANS).\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, students with disabilities continue to be served in less restrictive\nenvironments, although variation in placement by age, race/ethnicity, and disability continues to occur.

With access to public schools already guaranteed for 6.4 million children with disabilities, the 1997 reauthorization of IDEA set educators' and policymakers' sights on setting higher expectations and improving achievement\nfor these students, as well as on ensuring positive transitions to work or\npostsecondary education after graduation.\nAs part of the reauthorization, Congress instructed the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) to conduct a national assessment to \"examine how well schools, local education agencies, states and other recipients of assistance\" were meeting the requirements of the law. OSEP responded by designing two sets of studies: childoutcome longitudinal studies and topic-specific studies. One of the topic-specific\nstudies is a longitudinal policy study, known as the Study of State and Local\nImplementation and Impact of IDEA (SLIIDEA).\nThe SLIIDEA study is collecting data over a 5-year period by means of mail surveys\nat the state, district, and school levels and through focus studies of the\nimplementation of IDEA in selected school districts. The study is designed to combine the strengths of qualitative and quantitative data and to ensure that the data\ncan be generalized to other schools and districts across the country.\nThis module describes the results of Focus Study I, a qualitative study of district implementation of IDEA with a particular focus on how districts are addressing behavioral issues of children. We present the design and analytic framework for the focus study as well as a summary of focus study findings. The summary of findings is\nfollowed by a discussion of demographic and contextual factors affecting\nimplementation.\nIII-49\n\n\f24111 Annual Report to Congress\nThe Analytic Design of Focus Study I\nSLIIDEA's charge is to understand both the implementation and impact of policy changes made in the IDEA Amendments of 1997 at the state, district, and school levels. Implementation research has become especially important in the context of\nimpact evaluation. Program evaluators quickly realized that they could not\nunderstand how or why certain results occurred without first understanding how the programs had been implemented. This realization led, in the 1980s and 1990s, to more common coordination between implementation and impact studies over the last 2 decades. SLIIDEA is gathering descriptive data and is using these data to describe and interpret variations in how states and localities have used policies, resources, and practices to achieve the legislative goals.\nThe Evaluation Questions\nThe SLIIDEA focus studies were specifically designed to address two goals: (a) to describe IDEA policy implementation over time, and in particular, examine how states, districts, and schools reached the current state of practice with the use of policies and resources (longitudinal component) and (b) to expand and provide indepth information about one of the congressional issues (topical component). In combination with the state, district, and school surveys, the longitudinal component of the focus studies will address a series of congressionally mandated evaluation questions, looking at how well schools, local education agencies, and states are making progress toward:\nImproving the performance of children with disabilities in general scholastic activities and assessments as compared to nondisabled children;\nProviding for the participation of children with disabilities in the general\ncurriculum;\nHelping children with disabilities make effective transitions from early intervention to preschool, preschool to school, and school to adult life;\nPlacing and serving children with disabilities, including minority children, in the least restrictive environment appropriate;\nPreventing children with disabilities, especially those with emotional\ndisturbance or specific learning disabilities, from dropping out of school;\nAddressing behavioral problems of children with disabilities as compared to nondisabled children;\n\nIII-50\n\n1 99\n\n\fStudy of State and Local Implementation and Impact of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act: A View From the Field of District Implementation\n\nCoordinating services provided under IDEA with other educational and pupil services, including preschool and health and social services funded from other sources;\nProviding for the participation of parents in the education of their children with disabilities; and\nResolving disagreements between education personnel and parents through activities such as mediation.\nTo study implementation for each of the congressional issues, as well as the expanded topical issue, OSEP developed a set of implementation questions. Two sources of data contribute to answering the questionssurveys and focus studies.\nThese evaluation questions on implementation and impact include:\nHow do states, districts, and schools use policies, practices, and resources to serve children and youth with disabilities? What factors influence the use of these policies, practices, and resources? To what extent are states, districts, and schools making progress toward achieving academic outcomes?\nWhat is the relationship between state policy and practice and district and school policy and practice? Do state policies affect district and school practices, policies, and resources or the process of local change, and if so, how?\nWhat are the critical and emerging issues in states, districts, and schools?\n\nDesign and Data Collection\nIn Focus Study I, three criteria directed the selection of focus study sites. First, districts were nested in states to understand the relationships between states' policies and resources and local policies and practices. Five states were selected to represent geographic region and diversity of school populations. Up to four districts for each of the five states were recruited into the study. Second, the sampling frame consisted of districts from the full survey sample, excluding districts that had formally declined to participate. And last, the sample was also selected to represent districts that had made little progress toward implementing the 1997 Amendments of IDEA as well as those that had made considerable progress. By studying a range of districts, information about barriers and facilitators to implementation could be examined.\nData were collected via interviews and focus groups with district and school administrators, regular and special education teachers, and parents of students with\n\n200\n\nIII-51\n\n\f24th Annual Report to Congress\nand without disabilities. Following each round of site visits, data collectors wrote case study reports, authored jointly and checked for accuracy. All case study reports were imported and indexed using QSR NUD*IST 5.0, a software package designed to facilitate the organization and management of qualitative data.\nAnalysis Framework\nPreliminary coding schemes were developed for each of the nine congressional\nquestions, designed to focus analysis specifically on the key elements of implementationthe policies, practices, and resources used by districts to\nimplement IDEA. \"Policies\" were defined as legislation, rules and procedures; \"practices\" as the activities carried out to implement the policy or an activity already implemented by the state or locality; and \"resources\" as the staff, materials, and training used to implement policies and practices. The coding schemes also took into\naccount the comprehensiveness of implementation, analyzing whether policies, resources and practices were in place, and the consisteng of implementation, analyzing whether the various stakeholders shared similar perspectives on understanding the use of the policies, resources, and practices in use by the state or locality.\nIn the process of analyzing the site visit data, districts were classified into three categories of implementation. The features of the three categories of implementation\nfollow.\nCategory I: These districts showed minimal or no evidence of use of\nimplementation tools, inconsistencies between stated policies and actions taken, limited or minimal understanding of policy tools among stakeholder groups, stakeholder frustration or dissatisfaction.\nCategory II: These districts showed evidence of use of a wider range of implementation tools, inconsistencies between stated policies and activities, inconsistencies across stakeholders on the necessary knowledge base and\nskills required for implementation, stakeholder frustration or dissatisfaction.\nCategory III: These districts showed evidence of use of a comprehensive range of implementation tools, consistent relationship between stated policies and activities, consistency across stakeholders on the necessary knowledge base and skills required for implementation, stakeholder\nsatisfaction.\nAnalysts worked in pairs to score each site on the nine congressional issues as Category I, Category II, or Category III, as well as to provide brief justification for scores. Any discrepancies were resolved via consensus. After scoring, districts within\n111-52\n2 0\n\n\fStudy of State and Local Implementation and Impact of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act: A View From the Field of District Implementation\neach category of implementation were compared with respect to contextual and demographic characteristics to determine if any common features might explain observed patterns within an implementation category.\nThe Limitations\nFocus Study I was not designed to collect outcome data on the specific indicators for each congressional question. Rather, the surveys were designed to collect and report\non school outcomes.' Also, Focus Study I was not designed to collect data on indicators of quality for each of the issues addressed by the congressional questions. The research literature is too fragmented to define such indicators, and guiding principles have not been developed to define model programs, such as with school reform models. Thus, the analysis falls short of establishing a normative standard against which to judge how well districts are performing, beyond characterizing the\nextent of district implementation.\nAnd last, these three categories of implementation are anticipated to shift over time. As districts continue to address the legislative changes, fewer or more categories may emerge for each of the issues addressed by the congressional questions.\nFocus Study I Results\nThis section describes the results of Focus Study I. It begins with the Focus Study I topical issue, addressing student behavior, and continues by describing results related to six congressional questions.2\nAddressing Student Behavior\nThe 1997 reauthorization of IDEA broadened the authority of school personnel to remove a child with a disability from school for a serious disciplinary violation. Importantly, the 1997 reauthorization moved beyond a narrow focus on discipline by (a) requiring that after certain disciplinary action is taken, if the local education\n\nIn traditional impact studies, child and family outcomes are measured. SLIIDEA collects only data on organizational process and outcomes. Thus, SLIIDEA reports on the process of policy implementation of states, districts, and schools. We can describe these standards of practices and profile the variation observed.\n2 Insufficient data, particularly with respect to consistency across stakeholder perspectives, prevented categorization of districts on the three congressional issues of early childhood transition, secondary transition, and drop-out prevention, and these three issues are not described here.\n\n202\n\n111-53\n\n\f246 Annual Report to Congress\nagency (LEA) did not conduct a functional behavioral assessment and implement a behavioral intervention plan for the child before the behavior that resulted in the disciplinary action, the LEA must convene an individualized education program (IEP) meeting to develop an assessment plan to address the behavior, or if the child already has a behavioral intervention plan, the IEP team must review the plan and modify it as necessary and (b) describing how to determine whether the behavior was a manifestation of the child's disability. If a child with a disability has behavior problems that interfere with his or her learning or the learning of others, the IEP team must consider whether strategies, including positive behavioral interventions and functional behavioral assessments, are needed to address the behavior.\nTjpes and Ranges of Implementation Tools Obseived\nIn analyzing the implementation data for all 17 districts, analysts identified the policies, practices, and resources each district used to address behavioral issues of students with and without disabilities. These implementation tools are described\nbelow.\nPolicies\nBoth formal and informal policies were available for addressing proactive and reactive approaches to behavioral issues of children. In general, these types of policies focused on the use of positive behavioral supports (PBS)3 and discipline for all students, as well as the use of behavioral IEP goals for students with disabilities. Most often, when districts wrote proactive policies for addressing behavioral issues, the districts had established behavioral expectations for the children in the system with the intent of also teaching them the expected behaviors. Proactive policies included the use of character education programs,' use of behavioral assessments, and development of behavioral IEP goals. By setting proactive policies on behavior,\n3 In our visits with school districts, we found that the districts and schools used varying principles of Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS), but did not embody the specific model\narticulated by the OSEP Technical Assistance Center on PBIS. In our report, we use the\ndescriptions used by district and school personnel when describing their behavioral programs, and when available, we describe the principles associated with the behavioral program. Thus, our use of the term, positive behavioral supports (PBS) may be considered imprecise by readers familiar with the PBIS Center.\n4 Character education programs are designed to help students grow as moral beings and to equip them with the internal resources to act effectively on that desire. Educators need to help them develop a deep regard for themselves and for others, an abiding commitment to the core values of justice and caring, and the resolve to live by and speak up for what they believe while also heating, understanding, and accommodating the beliefs of others (Schaps, Schaeffer, & McDonnell, 2001).\nIII-54\n203\n\n\fStudy of State and Local Implementation and Impact of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act: A View From the Field of District Implementation\nthe districts had established how they expected children to conduct themselves with the goal of preventing behavior problems. Most often, when districts developed reactive approaches to behavior, the policies focused on responses to behavioral issues and inappropriate behaviors exhibited by children. In particular, districts established\nconsequences for inappropriate behaviors. Reactive policies included codes of\nconduct and suspension and expulsion procedures.\nPractices\nDistricts reported district-wide, school-wide, and classroom-wide practices that were usually, but not always, consistent with existing policies. As with policies, the practices included both proactive and reactive approaches to addressing behavioral\nissues. More specifically, districts reported on the use of positive behavioral strategies, the incorporation of behavioral goals in the child's IEP, and use of functional assessments. These proactive practices included a variety of behavior management strategies for supporting desirable behaviors, including teaching\nappropriate behaviors, teaching replacement strategies for children who consistently display inappropriate behaviors, using consequences for inappropriate behaviors, and supporting collaborative planning for teachers. Typical examples included character development programs such as \"Make My Day\" and \"Caught Being Good\" targeting specific age groups, rewards for appropriate behavior, anger management classes for select students, and the use of a functional behavioral assessment to identify the\nsource of students' problem behaviors. In addition, districts also reacted to\nbehavioral issues and put in place reactive procedures and practices, such as the use\nof specific intervention for a crisis and use of in-school and out-of school\nsuspensions and Saturday detentions.\nResources\nResources primarily included training opportunities for school personnel and the hiring of skilled staff, often with specialized training in behavior management. Other resources included written materials offering guidance and opportunities for teachers to collaborate with one another.\nDistribution of SitesAcross Implementation Categories\nWith regard to the Focus Study I topical issue of addressing student behavior, analysts categorized the 17 districts into three implementation categories described\nabove. Based upon the comprehensiveness of the district's use of the\nimplementation tools and consistency of perspectives across the stakeholders, three\nIII-55\n\n\f241!! Annual Report to Congress\n\ndistricts were categorized as Category I, 11 were categorized as Category II, and three were categorized as Category III.\n\nThe Category I districts generally took a reactive approach to behavioral management that relied on discipline rather than positive behavioral supports. The\nresponse to discipline infractions was toward an individual student and not a plan for\nthe system. These districts did not use or they misunderstood such proactive behavioral measures as PBS and functional behavioral assessments, and few\nresources were available to support staff development.\n\nCategory II districts used a wider range of practices to manage and prevent behavior\nproblems. This range included some schools implementing school behavioral programs, characterized as \"character education\" programs, as well as districts\nestablishing discipline policies. Individual teachers reported frequently using behavioral management systems as a strategy for classroom management. Some staff development was available to support proactive behavioral measures, yet few staff specialists were consistently available for school staff to access.\n\nCategory III districts had a comprehensive range of policies and practices to prevent\nand manage behavior problems, including codes of conduct and safety plans, handbooks on discipline, and guidelines for conducting functional behavioral assessments. Character development programs also were in evidence. Multiple staff development opportunities and resources, including behavioral experts, were\navailable.\n\nParent Participation\n\nThe changes to IDEA reflect a strengthening of the longstanding Federal\ncommitment to parent involvement in the education of their child with a disability. With the 1997 amendments, Congress has attempted to move this involvement further toward parents and school working together to meet the needs of the child. Changes in the law represent an effort to ensure that school officials consider parents as decision-making partners in providing special education and related services to their child. Congress also has required that parents be more responsive to the public agencies by notifying the agencies about their concerns and intentions.\n\nlypes and Ranges of Implementation Tools Observed\n\nAnalysts reviewed the policies, practices, resources, and evaluation tools used by districts to encourage parents' participation in their children's education. Across all 17 districts, we observed the following:\n\nIII-56\n\n205\n\n\fStudy of State and Local Implementation and Impact of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act: A View From the Field of District Implementation\n\nPolkies\nDistricts reported a range of both formal and informal policies, some that mirrored the procedures spelled out in IDEA and some that went beyond the requirements by offering more explicit guidance on how to encourage parent participation. For example, a district that regularly notified parents of their children's educational progress or of matters related to the scheduling of their IEP conferences was procedurally complying with the law. But a district that required teachers to monitor and record parent contact with phone logs showed how districts can engage parents more aggressively in educational decision making.\n\nPractices\nA wide range of practices were available across districts, some targeting all parents and some specifically targeting the parents of children with disabilities. Practices targeting all parents included parent/school communication (such as phone calls, report cards, parent/teacher conferences and \"Friday Folders\"), volunteer opportunities (such as fundraising or volunteering in the classroom), school functions (such as back-to-school nights and holiday parties), workshops, and opportunities to contribute to school and district-wide decision making. Practices targeting parents of students with disabilities included parent/school communication, involvement in the IEP process, workshops, support networks (including Special Education Parent Advisory Councils and parents of students with disabilities who have received training on how to help other parents understand their rights in IEP meetings), and the opportunity to participate in parent advisory committees.\n\nResources\n\nResources available across districts included workshops targeting either parents or educational personnel, printed materials such as handbooks and pamphlets, and\nfunds to support accommodations such as transportation to parent/teacher\nconferences or scheduling of alternate meeting times to fit parent work or childcare needs. Evaluation tools included surveys of parent satisfaction and tools to monitor\nparent/school contact.\n\nDistribution of Sites Across Implementation Categvries\n\nOn the basis of the data collected through the focus study, we can describe three categories of district implementation of the legislative requirements for parent\n\n206\n\nI[I-57\n\n\f24th Annual Report to Congress\nparticipation. Six districts were categorized as Category I, six districts were\ncategorized as Category II, and five districts were categorized as Category III.\nMost Category I districts had no formal policies to encourage parent participation, either for parents with or without children with disabilities. Nevertheless, teachers reported regular communications with parents on their children's educational progress through report cards or regular notes home. Few opportunities were available for higher level participation, including workshops or district-level decision making. Resources to support parental participation were minimal.\nMost Category II districts had informal goals to increase parent participation, and some did not distinguish between parents of children with or without disabilities. The districts often had interactive communications with parents that invited feedback on student progress. The role of parents in the IEP process ranged from superficial to very involved. Workshops and printed material offering guidance to parents of children with disabilities were widely used.\nCategory III districts were the most aggressive in engaging parents in their children's\neducation. Parents of students with and without disabilities participated in\neducational workshops and in shared decision-making bodies at the school or district level. Parents of students with disabilities often participated in support and advocacy groups.\nCurricular Access and Placement in the Least Restrictive Environment\nP.L. 94-142 required students with disabilities to be educated with their nondisabled peers to the maximum extent appropriate and prohibited the removal of students with disabilities from regular education environments except when the nature or severity of the disability was such that education in the regular classes could not be\nachieved satisfactorily. With the reauthorization of IDEA in 1997, the law maintained its commitment to educating students with disabilities in the least\nrestrictive environment, particularly for minority students.\nIn addition, however, the law now required that students with disabilities be\nprovided access to the general education curriculum, with a particular emphasis on supplementary aids and services. In the regulations finalized by the U.S. Department of Education in 1998 at 34 CFR 300.347(a)(1)(i), the general education curriculum is defined as \"the same curriculum as for nondisabled children\" (p. 98). Thus, students with disabilities continued to be educated alongside their nondisabled peers when appropriate, but they were also taught the same material and held to the same\n\nIII-58\n\n207\n\n\fStudy of State and Local Implementation and Impact of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act: A View From the Field of District Implementation\nstandards as their nondisabled peers, whether or not they were being educated in the same setting.\nTypes and Ranges of Implementation Tools Observed\nAmong the 17 districts, a variety of policies, practices, and resources were identified to support access to the general education curriculum by students with disabilities. Respondents did not distinguish between least restrictive environment and curricular access, and thus the findings combine the two congressional interests.\nPolicies\nThe policy elements described by districts were: (a) a commitment to providing students with disabilities access to the general education curriculum, most often defined as teaching the general education content and using the same materials; (b) having the IEP team determine the modifications needed to make curricular access possible for individual students; (c) having the same expectations for academic achievement for students with and without disabilities; and (d) using the state content standards as the general curriculum.\nPractices\nDistricts described a range of practices reflecting their efforts to provide students with disabilities access to the general curriculum and placement in the least restrictive environment. Practices included the following: providing a range of placement options, teaching students with and without disabilities the same content and using the same materials, providing instructional modifications as needed, encouraging and supporting collaboration among teachers in general education and special education, and improving the abilities of all teachers to address the individual needs of students.\nResources\nThe resources used most frequently were professional development activities for administrators and teachers and additional support staff such as instructional aides. SEAs and districts provided the professional development activities, which were attended by both general and special education staff. Topics relative to curricular access and LRE included co-teaching, differentiated instruction, and teaching heterogeneous groups.\n\n208\n\nM-59\n\n\f24\" Annual Report to Congress\nDistribution of SitesAcross Implementation Categvnes\nOn the basis of the data collected through the focus study, we defined three\ncategories of district implementation of the legislative requirements for access to the\ngeneral education curriculum and LRE. Among the 17 districts, three were\ncategorized as Category I, nine as Category II, and five as Category III.\nCategory I districts offered either (1) a continuum of services, but with placement options that were generally restrictive, or (2) full inclusion with a restrictive range of placements. Policies on access to the general education curriculum were generally not clear or did not offer individualized means for students with disabilities to gain curricular access. Usually students with disabilities were not expected to meet the same academic standards as students without disabilities.\nCategory II districts offered a continuum of least restrictive environment (LRE) placements for students with disabilities. These students usually were taught the same content as students without disabilities and were provided with instructional modifications if necessary. Professional development was available for special education and general education staff. Few policies or range of resources were made\navailable to schools.\nCategory III districts provided a continuum of LRE placement options for students, with IEP teams determining the best placement. The districts taught the same content to students with and without disabilities and provided instructional supports and modifications as determined by the IEP team. Expectations were the same for\nall students. Teachers had assistance from support staff, including school\npsychologists and instructional aides.\nIncluding Children With Disabilities in Accountabili0 Systems\nThe IDEA Amendments of 1997 require states to establish goals for the academic performance of children with disabilities and develop indicators to judge children's progress. The goals and indicators must be consistent, to the maximum extent appropriate, with the goals and standards for all children in the state. In addition, every 2 years the state must report to the Department of Education and to the public on progress toward meeting the established goals.\nThe amendments also address, for the first time, the inclusion of children with disabilities in state, local, and school accountability measures. Students with disabilities are to be included in general state and district-wide assessment programs with necessary accommodations, although some students with significant disabilities\nIII-60\n209\n\n\fStudy of State and Local Implementation and Impact of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act: A View From the Field of District Implementation\n\nmay participate in alternate assessments. Parents of students with disabilities must receive school reports on their child's progress at the same rate as their nondisabled peers. Finally, the IEP team must consider assessment results when developing each child's IEP, and states, districts, and schools must report on the participation and scholastic performance of students with disabilities on state and district-wide assessments.\n\nTypes and Ranges of Implementation Tools Observed\n\nThe following implementation tools were identified based on a review of the\ndescriptions of implementation from all 17 districts.\n\nPolicies\n\nThe core policy elements regarding participation of students with disabilities in assessments were, first and most important, that students with disabilities were expected to participate in the same assessments as students without disabilities. Additional policy elements supported providing assessment accommodations and alternate assessments as needed and reporting achievement scores of students with disabilities in disaggregated form even if they were also reported in aggregated form. While most districts did not describe formal policies concerning assessments, the\ndescribed practices revealed implicit policies.\n\nPractices\n\nSpecific practices paralleled the policy elements and included full participation of students with disabilities in assessments, provision of accommodations, provision of alternate assessments and disaggregated reporting of scores.\n\nResources\n\nResources, when described, most often consisted of training activities and availability of support staff.\n\nDistlibutiou of SifesAcross Implementation Categuries\n\nOn the basis of the data collected through the focus study, we could define three categories of district implementation of the legislative requirements for inclusion of\n\n10\n\nIII-61\n\n\f24th Annual Report to Congress\nstudents with disabilities in accountability measures. Among the 17 districts, six were categorized as Category I, eight as Category II, and three as Category III.\nAll Category I districts provided a range of assessment accommodations to students with disabilities such as setting, timing/scheduling, presentation, and response accommodations. The districts, however, did not use alternate assessments for students with more severe disabilities. Reported scores were not disaggregated for students with disabilities.\nCategory II districts required students with disabilities to participate in assessments. Students were supported by accommodations and alternate assessments; staff was supported by professional development and by assistants with expertise.\nCategory III districts ensured that all students were included in state and district assessments. The students received a full range of accommodations as determined by the IEP team. Alternate assessments were available for those students with severe\ndisabilities.\nFactors Affecting the Progress of District Implementation\nCertain themes were apparent among districts within each implementation category. In general, similarities were most apparent on socio-economic and demographic factors for Category I and III districts. These districts also appeared to be influenced by state and historical influences. Fewer similarities were apparent in contextual factors among Category II districts. Examples of the demographic and contextual factors contributing to the progress of the Category I and III districts are presented below.\nCategoiyI Districts\nMinor4 Studellts and Poverty\nTwo of the demographic similarities evident in the Category I districts were minority status and poverty. In the districts that most often were classified Category I across the issues studied, medium to high percentages of students were minorities. Similarly,\nmedium to high percentages of students also received free and reduced-price\nlunches.\n\nIII-62\n\n21 1\n\n\fStudy of State and Local Implementation and Impact of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act: A View From the Field of District Implementation\n\nServing high percentages of students who are minorities and living in poverty places demands on districts (National Research Council, 2002). As noted below, just as\nCategory III districts were able to focus on instructional goals without the\ndistractions of coping with students who had outside pressures, Category I districts had less time to focus on instructional goals. Students living in poverty often come to school with more educational, social, and emotional needs. They may present more challenges to districts because they often come from homes where one or both parents are not present, or they may be distracted from learning because they come to school hungry. Also, reaching out to parents of these students presents additional challenges to districts because the parents are working two or more jobs, or possibly had endured unsatisfactory schooling experiences.\n\nState Support\n\nCategory I district administrators reported general dissatisfaction with state support across all the issues we studied. In the area of access, all the Category I districts\nindicated dissatisfaction with state support; four of the six districts indicated dissatisfaction on state support for parent participation issues; and two of three\ndistricts indicated dissatisfaction with support with behavior issues. It was apparent that these districts were waiting for direction from the state, and their schools were waiting for direction from them.\n\nCategory III Districts\n\nPoverty\n\nAll the districts classified as Category III on behavior, parent participation, access to the general education curriculum, and accountability had few students living in poverty.\n\nIt is likely that students from higher income families in these districts had fewer social challenges than students living in poverty, and therefore they may present fewer significant behavior problems to schools. Therefore, the Category III districts, which were consistent about preventing behavioral issues, may have been the ones that had the most time to concentrate on providing these services because they were\nleast challenged on a day-to-day basis.\n\nWealthier Category III districts may also have had better access to resources that allowed them to be more consistent about applying policy tools that benefited students with disabilities. Their property tax base was higher, so these districts could\n\n212\n\nIII-63\n\n\f241h Annual Report to Congress\nafford to offer better salaries and professional development activities for teachers and staff. Better trained staff had access to newer methods and more time to keep up with research. As a consequence, there was more evidence in these districts of all the things that allow them to offer a coherent approach to policy implementation.\nIn addition, parent participation in Category III districts could have been influenced by parents' income levels. Parents from higher income brackets, for example, typically have had better lifelong experiences with schools and therefore are more motivated and better equipped to play a role in their children's education. The converse is that low-income parents are typically more intimidated by schools sometimes because they do not receive the same attention and respect from school officials as higher income parents.\nSize\nAll of the districts classified as Category III on the issues of access, parent\nparticipation, accountability, and behavior were small, each with fewer than 10,000\nstudents. It is possible that these districts were more consistently using\nimplementation tools benefiting students with disabilities because their attention was less fragmented. Perhaps these districts could attend more effectively to use of a comprehensive set of implementation tools because they were less overwhelmed than districts serving large numbers of students.\nThe data also suggest that their small size gave these districts the ability to\nindividualize services. With time to familiarize themselves with student needs, district educators might have had more incentive to use the full range of implementation tools available to them.\nSuburban\nAlthough all but two of the districts in the study sample were classified suburban rather than urban, it might nevertheless be noteworthy that in virtually every issue area, all the Category III schools were suburban. The only exception was an urban district that was classified as Category III on parent participation.\nRole of the State\nIn each of the areas of interest, most of the Category III districts were in the\nNortheast. Specifically, every district classified as Category III in assessment, access,\n\nIII-64\n\n2 1 3\n\n\fStudy of State and Local Implementation and Impact of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act: A View From the Field of District Implementation\n\nand behavior was in the Northeast as were four of the five districts in parent\nparticipation.\n\nThe pattern could suggest that states with historic commitments to implementation efforts for educating students with disabilities have had an important influence on the comprehensiveness of district policies, practices, and resources.\n\nThe first of these two states passed legislation concerning the education of students with disabilities in 1972; their law served as a model for the Federal Education for the Handicapped Act (EHA) passed in 1975. Since the 1970s, then, this state has\nrequired districts to educate students with disabilities in the least restrictive environment, which was often a general education classroom. In 1993, the state's comprehensive education reform act went further and emphasized that special education must be consistent with curriculum frameworks and that children with\ndisabilities would continue to be integrated into the general education curriculum.\n\nThe second of these two states does not have a long history of special education reform, but its longtime commitment to high-stakes statewide testing seems to have had an impact on more recent state education reforms on access issues. The state has administered statewide tests for over 100 years, and since 1977, students have been required to take the statewide tests as a condition for high school graduation. So, the state has had a culture that accepts high-stakes testing as an expected and serious part of the school experience.\nSummary\n\nIn sum, Category I districts were most likely to show similarities in race and poverty.\nThese districts often had medium to high percentages of minority students and medium to high percentages of students living in poverty. Serving high percentages of students who are minorities and living in poverty places demands on districts,\nmaking it more difficult for them to focus on instructional issues.\n\nAlso, these districts registered less satisfaction than Category III districts with the state's leadership and support on issues relating to serving students with disabilities. It is likely that the districts' own weaknesses made them more dependent on state support than Category III districts, which were able to rely on their own internal resources and therefore were less dependent on state guidance.\n\nCategory III districts were more likely to have fewer students living in poverty, be smaller in size, and be suburban. Most also were located in the Northeast, where\n\n214\n\nIII-65\n\n\f24111 Annual Report to Congress\nthere have been historic commitments to educating students with disabilities. The pattern could suggest that states with historic commitments to implementation efforts for educating students with disabilities have had an important influence on the comprehensiveness of district policies, practices, and resources.\nThe patterns observed in Category I and III district suggest intriguing possibilities for further research into the importance of demographic issues and the roles of states in determining the use and nature of districts' policies, practices, and resources relating to students with disabilities.\n\n111-66\n\n4\u00b0 1. 5\n\n\fStudy of State and Local Implementation and Impact of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act: A View From the Field of District Implementation\nReference\nNational Research Council.

RESULTS\nHigh School Graduation Among Students With Disabilities Results Experienced by Children and Families 1 Year After\nBeginning Early Intervention State Improvement and Monitoring\n21 7\n\n\fHigh School Graduation Among Students With Disabilities\nThe percentage of students with disabilities exiting school with a regular high school diploma and the percentage who drop out are performance indicators that the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) uses to measure progress in improving results for students with disabilities. This module reports graduation and dropout rates for students with disabilities age 14 and older during the 1999-2000 school year and examines changes in these rates since 1995-96. The module also discusses graduation and dropout rates by disability category and by race/ethnicity.\nGraduation and Dropout Rates for Students With Disabilities\nAccording to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), there are many different ways to calculate graduation and dropout rates (NCES, 2000). The appropriate method largely depends on the data available and the questions to be addressed. For the purpose of establishing performance indicators under the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), OSEP calculates the graduation rate by dividing the number of students age 14 and older who graduated with a standard diploma by the total number of students in the same age group who are known to have left school (i.e., graduated with a standard diploma, received a certificate of completion, reached the maximum age for services, died, or dropped out). The dropout rate is calculated in the same manner but with the number of dropouts in the numerator.\nMost states use several types of diplomas or certificates to document that a student has completed high school. Although a standard diploma is considered the most desirable outcome for all students, including those with disabilities, the definition of a standard diploma and the criteria for earning it vary by state. In general, there are four categories of diploma options. The first is a standard diploma or better with a single set of criteria for all students. Under this option, a standard diploma or a more rigorous alternative, such as an honors diploma, is available to all students. All students must meet the same criteria in order to receive a diploma, including adequate performance on any tests required for graduation (Thurlow & Thompson,\n1999).\nThe second option also involves a standard diploma or better, but includes multiple criteria for earning it. This alternative allows some students to earn the diploma by meeting different criteria, such as completing their IEP goals. A third option is a\n21 8\n\n\f24\" Annual Report to Congress\ncertificate of attendance, completion, or achievement, which is available to all students. Certificate requirements can vary considerably from state to state, and students with IEPs may or may not be allowed to meet the criteria in different ways. The fourth alternative is a special education diploma or certificate that is available only to students with IEPs. This type of diploma is usually added to other diploma options for students without disabilities. All four diploma options vary in rigor and have specific benefits and drawbacks for students with IEPs (Thurlow & Thompson,\n1999).\nIn 1999-2000, the standard diploma graduation rate for students with disabilities age 14 and older was 56.2%. As shown in Figure IV-1, although the graduation rate was down slightly from the previous year, on the whole it has steadily improved since 1995-96.' During this period, the graduation rate rose from 52.6% to 56.2%. During the same period, the dropout rate declined from 34.1% to 29.4%. Figure IV-2 shows the change in the dropout rate.\nGraduation and Dropout Rates by Disability\nIn 1999-2000, the graduation rate varied considerably by disability category.\nGraduation rates ranged from a low of 39.5% for students with mental retardation to a high of 73.4% for students with visual impairments. Seven of the 12 disability categories had graduation rates above 60% (visual impairments, hearing impairments, other health impairments, speech/language impairments, traumatic brain injury, orthopedic impairments, and specific learning disabilities). The remaining disabilitY categories (deaf-blindness, multiple disabilities, autism, emotional disturbance, and mental retardation) had graduation rates below that for all students with disabilities. Table IV-1 presents the graduation rates for each of the 12 disability categories (see Table AD2).\nTable INT-1 also shows that the dropout rate varied by disability category. Only one disability category, emotional disturbance, had a dropout rate (51.4%) above the rate for all students with disabilities. The rate for all students is largely dependent on the number of students with learning disabilities, since they account for more than half of the total number of students served under IDEA. Four disability categories had dropout rates below 15%: deaf-blindness, autism, visual impairments, and hearing impairments (see Table AD2).\nThe decline in the graduation rate for 1999-2000 is the result of a slightly inflated graduation rate for 1998-99. During that year, a number of states appear to have underreported the number of dropouts and certificates received. This in turn reduced the size of the denominator and increased the graduation rate.\nW-2\n2 1 9\n\n\fHigh School Graduation Among Students With Disabilities\nFigure IV-1 Percentage of Students Age 14 and Older Graduating With a Standard\nDiploma, 1995-96 to 1999-2000\n\n60 52.6\n50 -\n40 -\nor 0.0\nu1:1 30 -\nor\n04\n20 -\n10 -\n0\n1995-96\n\n53.5\n1996-97\n\n55.4\n1997-98\nYear\n\n57.4\n\n56.2\n\n1998-99\n\n1999-2000\n\nNote:\n\nGraduation rates were calculated by dividing the number of students 14 and older who graduated with a standard diploma by the number of students 14 and older who graduated with a standard diploma, received a certificate, reached the maximum age for services, died,\nor dropped out.\n\nSource: U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education Programs, Data Analysis System\nPANS).\n\nDuring the period 1995-96 to 1999-2000, the rate of change in the graduation rate was different across disability categories. As shown in Table IV-2, some categories experienced noticeable improvement in the graduation rate, but for other categories the rate remained stable. The rate of improvement in the graduation rate was highest\nfor students with multiple disabilities, speech or language impairments, emotional disturbance, autism, and deaf-blindness. With the exception of speech or language\nimpairments, these are all disability categories mentioned above as having graduation rates below the average for all disability categories combined.

With the exception of mental retardation, these are all disability categories described above as having graduation rates above the rate for disabled students as a whole.\nWith two exceptions, since 1995-96 all disability categories experienced an improvement in dropout rate. One notable exception is deaf-blindness which, as shown in Table IV-2, had a dramatic increase in the dropout rate between 1995-96 and 1999-2000. Deaf-blindness is one of the smallest disability categories, and the dropout rate for this category varies widely from one year to the next.

However, because this was only the second year these data were collected, caution should be used when interpreting\nthe results. In the next year or two, a clearer picture of these data should emerge.\n\nAs described in Table IV-3, the graduation and dropout rates varied for students in different racial/ethnic groups. The graduation rate was highest, and the dropout rate lowest, for White and Asian/Pacific Islander students. Both groups graduated at a rate that was higher, and dropped out at a rate that was lower, than those for all students with disabilities. The graduation rate for White students was 62.5%; for Asian/Pacific Islander students it was 56.3%. The dropout rate was 19.3% for\nAsian/Pacific Islander students, and 26.5% for White students. The lowest graduation rate was for Black students (39.7%). The dropout rate was highest for\nAmerican Indian/Alaska Native students (44.0%) (see Table AD4).\n\nSummary\nBetween 1995-96 and 1999-2000, the high school graduation rate for students with disabilities increased from 52.6% to 56.2%.

These improvements were more notable in some disability categories than in others. The biggest gains in the\ngraduation rate were for students with multiple disabilities, speech/language\nimpairments, emotional disturbance, autism, and deaf-blindness. Most of these are disability categories with the lowest graduation rates. It is unclear why some of the most significant disabilities showed increases in graduation rate; OSEP's longitudinal studies should help explain the change. Similarly, improvement in the dropout rate took place in almost every disability category, most notably among students with speech/language impairments, specific learning disabilities, orthopedic impairments, hearing impairments, and emotional disturbance. Graduation and dropout rates also varied by racial/ethnic group. White students had the highest graduation rate, and Asian/Pacific Islander students had the lowest dropout rate.\nW-8\n225\n\n\fHigh School Graduation Among Students With Disabilities\nReferences\nNational Center for Education Statistics (NCES).

Part C was\nenacted because of the urgent and substantial need:\n\n(1) to enhance the development of infants and toddlers with disabilities and to minimize their potential for developmental delay;\n\n(2) to reduce the educational costs to our society, including our Nation's schools, by minimizing the need for special education and related services\nwhen infants and toddlers with disabilities reach school age;\n\n(3)\n\nto minimize the likelihood of institutionalization of individuals with disabilities and maximize the potential for their independently living in\n\nsociety;\n\n(4) to enhance the capacity of families to meet the special needs of their infants and toddlers with disabilities (631(a)).\n\nTo examine what happens to infants and toddlers with special needs and their families during and after early intervention, the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) commissioned the National Early Intervention Longitudinal Study\n(NEILS). NEILS is following a nationally representative sample of 3,338 infants and\ntoddlers who received early intervention services for the first time between\nSeptember 1997 and November 1998. Information is being collected repeatedly on these children and their families throughout the early intervention years and then again when the children enter kindergarten. The sample consists of children from four birth years. The oldest children in the study exited early intervention in 1998 and started kindergarten in 2000-01. The youngest exited the early intervention service system in 2001 and will probably begin kindergarten in 2003-04. Data from NEILS will play a key role in efforts to improve early intervention services and results for infants and toddlers with disabilities. Descriptive information about the characteristics of children and families receiving early intervention were presented in the 22nd and 23n1 Annual Reports to Congress. This chapter provides data about child and\nfamily results 1 year after entry into early intervention services.\n\n\f24th Annual Report to Congress\nProgression of Children Through Services\nThis chapter examines the results for children and families approximately 12 months\nafter they began early intervention services. The information is based on two\ntelephone interviews conducted with a family member of the child enrolled in early intervention.' The first interview was conducted within the first 4 months after the initial individualized family service plan (IFSP). Most (68%) were conducted within 6 weeks of the IFSP. For younger children, a second interview was conducted about\n12 months after the first IFSP. We began trying to contact the families at\napproximately 11 months after the IFSP and continued until 15 months. For older children, those who turned 36 months of age within the year after the first interview, an interview was conducted around the time the child turned 36 months of age. Thirty-six months is the age when children would be expected to leave early intervention services, and the study design called for interviewing the families of all children at this critical juncture. Nearly all (94%) of these interviews were conducted within 3 months of the child's 3-year birthday. For the first interview and the 36month interview, if a family member could not be reached for the interview, the family was sent a mail questionnaire containing a subset of the questions in the interview. Eighty families returned the survey associated with the first interview, and\n84 returned the survey for the 36-month interview. The data from the mail questionnaires were always collected at least 5 months after the intended data collection point because the questionnaires were only mailed out after months of\nunsuccessfully trying to reach the family by telephone.\nThis module describes results for children and families that had the potential, based on the child's age at IFSP, to spend roughly a year in early intervention. The findings are based on those families who had a family interview (or mail questionnaire) at entry and about 12 months later (n=2,235, 67% of the original sample). The actual time between the first and second data collections ranged from 35 to 69 weeks, with a median of 46 weeks. This timeframe is less than 12 months for most children because all of the first interviews were conducted after the IFSP, and some of the\nsecond interviews were conducted before a complete year had passed. For\nconvenience, we refer to these data as describing the status of children \"12 months later\" because the second data collection was approximately a year after the first IFSP.\nBy definition, the data presented in this chapter exclude the oldest children entering early intervention. (Consider a child who entered early intervention at 29 months of\n' The adult best able to talk about each child and his/her early intervention experiences was the respondent for the telephone interview; the vast majority were the child's biological, adoptive, or foster mother (90%), and respondents are referred to as parents here.\nIV-12\n228\n\n\fResults Experienced by Children and Families 1 Year After Beginning Early Intervention\nFigure IV-3 Status of Children Less Than 26 Months of Age 12 Months After Initial IFSP\nEarly Intervention (EI) Entrants (under 31 months at IFSP)\n\nAge at IFSP\n\n<26 Months: 80%\n\n26 to 30 Months: 20%\n\nU Months Later\n\nDeceased: 1%\n\nAlive: 90%\n\nUnknown: 9%\n\nEI or Spec.

The first interview could have been conducted when the child was 30 months and the second interview at 36 months so only 6 months would have passed between the first and second interview.) Data on all children at 36 months will be included in subsequent NEILS reports, but these analyses focus on the group of children for whom there were data at two time points, with the second being roughly a year after the initial IFSP. NEILS used 26 months of age at IFSP or younger as the cutoff to define the group. All findings are weighted data.\n\nChildren and Families Included in This Chapter. About 80% of the early\nintervention entrants' were under 26 months at the time the IFSP was developed (see Figure IV-3). Because there are substantial differences within the early intervention population between children who enter early intervention at younger\nand older ages, it is important to emphasize that these children do not represent the entire population of children in early intervention. The children who have the potential to spend at least a year in early intervention and for whom data are presented in this chapter differ from the general population of early intervention\n\nI\n\nChildren in the sample had to be younger than 31 months at study enrollment because those entering later than that would not have participated in early intervention long enough to justify\n\nfollowing them longitudinally.\n\nIV-13\n\nBEST COPYNAILABLE\n\n229\n\n\f24111 Annual Report to Congress\nentrants with regard to why they are eligible for early intervention. About half of\nchildren under 26 months of age at IFSP (52%) are eligible because of a\ndevelopmental delay compared with 85% of the older group. Conversely, 24% of the younger group were eligible because of a diagnosed condition compared to only 7%\nof the older group. For almost half of the older group (49%), a speech or\ncommunication problem was listed as their only reason for being eligible for early intervention. This was the case for only 17% of the younger children.\nThe groups also varied in regard to gender. (At least one study has examined the association between gender and reason for eligibility; see Hebbeler,Wagner, Spiker,\nScarborough, Simeonsson, & Collier, 2001.) Seventy-one percent of the older children were male compared to 58% of the younger children. The groups also\ndiffered in regard to whether the family had received public assistance. The families of the younger children were poorer: 42% of them were receiving public assistance at the time of the IFSP compared to 30% of the older children. Children who have the potential to receive a year of early intervention service are a fundamentally different group of children from those who enter in late toddlerhood (and therefore cannot receive at least a year of service). The significance of these differences for the findings presented cannot be easily understood without additional analyses (which will be forthcoming), but it is important to reiterate that these results only reflect information about the 80 families surveyed and do not generalize to all children in early intervention.\nContinuing Receipt of Services Mter 12 Months. Among children who began\nearly intervention services at less than 26 months ofage, about 1% died over the next 12 months, and the status of another 9% was unknown (see Figure IV-3). Of the 90% known to be living 12 months after entering early intervention, about two thirds (64%) were reported by their parents to be receiving either early intervention or preschool special education at the time. Another 20% were reported to be receiving\nno service, and the service status of 17% was unknown.2 Although the age of transition out of early intervention approximates 36 months, it can vary by several\nmonths in either direction depending on state and local policies and where the child's birthday falls relative to the school year. Therefore, early intervention and preschool special education were combined to identify the group of children still receiving services 12 months later. Again, other NEILS analyses will focus exclusively on the transition at 36 months and provide detailed information about what happens to children as they leave early intervention.\n2 These figures could change as additional NEILS data sets are analyzed and merged with the family data. For example, data from the service providers might confirm that a child was alive and receiving services 12 months later even though there are no data from the family.\n1V-14\n230\n\n\fResults Experienced by Children and Families 1 Year After Beginning Early Intervention\nThe remainder of this chapter presents many different kinds of results for both children and families. For children, we look at health, functioning, behavior, and\ndevelopmental attainments. For families, we address family satisfaction with services, parenting skills, family and community supports, and child and family situation.\nBecause many of the findings are quite different for children of different ages, especially in regard to the child result areas, the findings are presented separately for four groups of children. The four groups are based on the child's age at the time of entry into early intervention (the signing of the initial IFSP): under 6 months, 6 to under 12 months, 12 to under 18 months, and 18 months to under 26 months.\nFor each individual result area, we compare what the group looked like at entry and 12 months later. Statistically significant changes in the group between these two time periods are highlighted in the tables with bolding and described in the text.\nResults for Children\nChild Functioning\nTo describe the nature of the abilities and disabilities of children receiving early intervention services, parents were asked a series of questions about various aspects of their child's functioning, including vision, hearing, mobility, and communication. In some of these areas, it is reasonable to expect that the number of problems would actually increase over time, especially for the youngest children, who began services as tiny babies. For example, as these children grow and develop, some of the problems associated with poor birth histories may manifest themselves.\nFor all four age groups, the small proportion of children with a diagnosed hearing problem is similar at entry and 1 year later (see Table IV-4). For the two youngest and the oldest age group, there was a significant increase in the number of infants who had a diagnosed vision problem by 1 year after beginning early intervention. This is a positive finding in that children with suspected problems with vision are being identified and referred for formal evaluations.\nThe percentage of infants and toddlers having trouble using their arms and hands at the time of entry into early intervention and 1 year later is similar for those in the youngest age group and in the two oldest age groups. There was a significant increase in the proportion of those infants who entered between 6 and 12 months and were reported to have normal use of their arms and hands 1 year later.\n\n2 31\n\nIV-15\n\n\f241!

For the youngest age group, more children are reported to be having some difficulty using legs and feet 1 year later. Many of these infants were eligible due to low birth weight or perinatal complications for which gross motor delays may not be apparent until the later half of the first year of life. In contrast, for the other three age groups, 1 year later, more children were reported to have normal functioning of their legs and feet.\nMany of the children in all groups were reported as having trouble communicating.' The change over time results are only meaningful for the two oldest age groups since the items about communication were not asked for infants less than 12 months of age. Nevertheless, for the two youngest age groups, 1 year later, many of them were having communication difficulties (39% and 51%, respectively). In the two oldest age groups, many of whom had a speech and language delay as a primary reason for referral to early intervention, there was a significant increase in the proportion of children who were reported to communicate just as well as other children. Both the improvement and the pervasiveness of language problems among the 18- to 26months olds are apparent. The percentage of children reported to communicate as well as other children in this age group rose from 26% to 35%. This is a significant increase, but it means, however, that 65% of the children are not communicating as well as other children. Parents were also asked about how easy the child is to understand when talking to people he or she doesn't know. Many of the children entering after 12 months of age were not yet using words to communicate, but many more of them were speaking 1 year later. One year later, many of those older toddlers were now speaking, but many of them were somewhat or very hard to understand.\nGeneral Health and Health Care\nParents were asked several questions regarding their child's current health, health care, and health insurance status. Although some children receive early intervention for disabling conditions related to their health, many children are eligible for services because of developmental problems rather than health per se.

It is also notable that more of the children in the two youngest age groups are rated as having fair or poor general health at both times compared to the children in the two oldest age groups. The only group with a change over time was the children who began early intervention between 6 and 12 months: 1 year later, fewer of them were rated as having fair or poor health.\nAnother measure of health is how many nights the child has been hospitalized since coming home from the hospital at birth. These data can only increase over time since the measure is a cumulative count over the child's life, and it did significantly increase for each of the age groups. The more extensive medical involvement of the children who began early intervention as infants compared to those who begin over 18 months is also captured in these data. A year after beginning early intervention, 34% of the youngest group had been hospitalized 5 or more days compared to only 16% for the children who began as 18- to 26-month-olds.\nConsistent with the ratings of overall health, many children in early intervention were reported to be taking prescription medication for a chronic condition (about one third of the first three age groups, and nearly one fifth of the oldest toddlers). The percentages of each age group taking medication did not change over time. For the youngest infants, those who entered early intervention under 6 months of age, the\npercentage reported to be using a medical device of some sort (with the most\ncommon medical devices being respirators, breathing monitors, and nebulizers) was smaller 1 year later.\nWith regard to health care, families of nearly all children in early intervention reported that their children had a place to go for regular medical care, and there was\nno change over the first year in early intervention. Similarly, nearly all children were covered by health insurance, and the percentages of children with coverage did not change over this first year. Finally, about one in five families in each age group reported that their insurance company had refused to pay for something they tried to get for their child, and there were no changes in this proportion from entry to 1 year later.\n\n4 The available national data are for children under age 5 (Adams, Hendershot, & Marano, 1999). For this reason, some of the difference between the national data and these early intervention data could be due to the older children included in the national data.\n\n235\n\nW-19\n\n\f24' Annual Report to Congress\nBehavior\nChildren vary in temperament and personality style from a very early age. The importance of some of these differences is not readily apparent. Does a 2-year-old who pays attention for a long period of time become the child who stays focused in first grade? Does the aggressive toddler become the 5-year-old with behavior problems? Part of the significance of the NEILS behavioral data rests in their stability or the extent to which early behavior serves as a predictor of later behavior. Parents were asked to rate their child's behavior across a number of dimensions; some of the items were not relevant for the youngest infants (e.g., trouble playing with other children), so it is important to describe these behaviors within each of the\nfour age groups and over time.\nFor those infants who entered early intervention under 6 months of age, 1 year later significantly fewer of them were described as being jumpy or easily startled, perhaps reflecting maturation (see Table IV-6). About half of these youngest infants were described as having trouble paying attention and staying focused, both at entry and 1 year later. Similarly, about half were reported to have sleep problems, both at entry and 1 year later. Families' ratings of how easy it was to take the child places were similar at entry and 1 year later. Note that for other behavior ratings that were only relevant for this group 1 year later, such as does things on his own, or trouble playing with or being aggressive with other children, between 10% and 30% of them are having significant troubles with some of these behaviors as they enter toddlerhood.\nFor infants who entered early intervention between 6 and 12 months of age, the patterns on the behavior ratings were similar to those for the younger infants. A notable difference, however, was that more of these children were rated as a little difficult to take places 1 year later than they had been at entry to early intervention. This change may reflect a developmental change from being an infant to a toddler rather than indicating anything about the child's disability or functioning.\nFor the two oldest age groups, across many different behavior items, a similar pattern emerged. Some children, usually about half, were reported by their caregiver to have no trouble with a given behavior. Another third of the children were reported as having some difficulty, and 10% to 40% of the children are described as having behavioral challenges. As for significant changes over time, for those who entered between 12 and 18 months, more of them were described 1 year later as having some trouble playing with peers and with being aggressive with peers, and fewer were described as being jumpy or easily startled. Only two ratings were different over time for the oldest age group: 1 year later, more of them were described as being very active and excitable, and more of them were harder to take\nplaces.\n1V-20\n236\n\n\fResults Experienced by Children and Families 1 Year After Beginning Early Intervention\n\nTable IV-6 Behaviors of Children Entering Early Intervention and a Year Later by Age\nGroup at Entry\n\nAge group at entry\nN=\nDoes things on own even if hard\nVery much like this child A little like this child Not like this child Not asked (if < 12 months\nat interview)\nPays attention and stays focused\nVery much like this child A little like this child Not like this child\nJumpy and easily startled\nVery much like this child A little like this child Not like this child\nVery active and excitable Very much like this child A little like this child Not like this child Not asked (if < 12 months\nat interview)\nTrouble playing with other children\nNo trouble Some trouble A lot of trouble Not around other children Not asked (if < 12 months\nat interview)\nAggressive with other children\nNot at all Sometimes Often Not asked (if < 12 months\nat interview)\n\n0 to 6 Months At Year entry later\n552\n\n--\n\n45\n\n--\n\n34\n\n--\n\n21\n\n100\n\n<1\n\n46\n\n45\n\n38\n\n38\n\n16\n\n17\n\n35\n\n24\n\n33\n\n29\n\n32\n\n47\n\n34\n\n--\n\n34\n\n32\n\n100\n\n<1\n\n66\n\n18\n\n12\n\n4\n\n100\n\n<1\n\n55\n\n36\n\n8\n\n100\n\n<1\n\n6 to 12 Months At Year entry later\n465\n\n6\n\n48\n\n4\n\n34\n\n4\n\n18\n\n86\n\n--\n\n44\n\n40\n\n35\n\n39\n\n21\n\n21\n\n29\n\n23\n\n33\n\n31\n\n38\n\n46\n\n6\n\n36\n\n2\n\n31\n\n5\n\n33\n\n86\n\n--\n\n9\n\n62\n\n3\n\n24\n\n1\n\n10\n\n1\n\n4\n\n87\n\n9\n\n51\n\n3\n\n42\n\n1\n\n7\n\n87\n\n12 to 18 Months At Year entry later\n338\n\n42\n\n51\n\n35\n\n31\n\n23\n\n18\n\n--\n\n41\n\n40\n\n41\n\n42\n\n18\n\n18\n\n23\n\n17\n\n31\n\n32\n\n46\n\n51\n\n37\n\n31\n\n31\n\n34\n\n32\n\n34\n\n--\n\n--\n\n64\n\n55\n\n23\n\n34\n\n8\n\n11\n\n4\n\n1\n\n--\n\n--\n\n51\n\n37\n\n42\n\n51\n\n7\n\n12\n\n--\n\n--\n\n18 to 26 Months At Year entry later\n880\n\n57\n\n56\n\n32\n\n33\n\n11\n\n11\n\n--\n\n41\n\n39\n\n39\n\n39\n\n20\n\n22\n\n18\n\n18\n\n27\n\n26\n\n56\n\n56\n\n38\n\n41\n\n34\n\n29\n\n29\n\n30\n\n--\n\n--\n\n55\n\n56\n\n35\n\n33\n\n9\n\n10\n\n2\n\n1\n\n--\n\n37\n\n37\n\n53\n\n54\n\n10\n\n9\n\n--\n\nBEST COPY AVAILABLE\n\n237\n\nW-21\n\n\f24th Annual Report to Congress\n\nTable IV-6 (continued)\n\nAge group at entry\n\n0 to 6 Months\nAt Year entry later\n\n12 to 18 Months At Year entry later\n\n12 to 18 Months At Year entry later\n\n18 to 26 Months\nAt Year entry later\n\nChild has sleep trouble Rarely or never\nSometimes Often\n\n51\n\n56\n\n49\n\n55\n\n53\n\n46\n\n56\n\n54\n\n30\n\n26\n\n33\n\n26\n\n26\n\n32\n\n25\n\n29\n\n20\n\n18\n\n19\n\n19\n\n21\n\n21\n\n19\n\n17\n\nHow easy is it to take\n\nchild to the store or an\n\nappointment\n\nEasier than other children 22\n\n25\n\n26\n\n21\n\n28\n\n21\n\n21\n\n16\n\nhis/her age\n\nJust_ as easy\n\n48\n\n46\n\n47\n\n49\n\n43\n\n45\n\n43\n\n42\n\nA little harder Much harder\n\n20\n\n20\n\n18\n\n23\n\n21\n\n23\n\n24\n\n27\n\n10\n\n8\n\n9\n\n7\n\n9\n\n11\n\n12\n\n15\n\nNote:\n\nNs refer to the number in each age group.

Additional longitudinal data will reveal whether these challenges persist over time and thus their importance for future growth and development.\n\nDevelopmental Accomplishments\n\nAttaining age-appropriate developmental competencies is an important accomplishment for all infants and toddlers. It is significant for children under 3 because it facilitates interaction with the environment, which forms the foundation of individual child development. The developmental accomplishments of infancy and toddlerhood are also important because they lay the groundwork for the next level of developmental skills children must master as they move through the preschool years and then enter elementary school. For example, communication and mobility are important developmental tasks for young children. Acquiring beginning communication skills allows the child to more effectively communicate his or her needs. Similarly, becoming mobile provides access to a much broader range of environments and objects to explore and enjoy. On the other hand, the child without\nadequate communication skills is limited in his or her ability to interact with\n\nIV-22\n\n2 38\n\n\fResults Experienced by Children and Families 1 Year After Beginning Early Intervention\ncaregivers and others in his or her social world and is possibly frustrated by this limitation. A child who is not mobile is restricted to where he or she is placed and reliant on what others bring for the child to explore.\nNEILS examined developmental attainments by asking parents to report on a set of child behavior and skills in several domains. For each item, the parent was to report whether the child \"does it well,\" \"does it but not well,\" or \"doesn't do it at all.\" The specific milestones were selected because they were judged to have face validity as markers of developmental attainment, to be universal in expression with minimal cultural/socioeconomic bias, and to be observable in everyday activities.\nThe status of children upon entry into early intervention and 1 year later on a select set of the milestones is shown in Tables IV-7 and IV-8. In interpreting these data, it is important to remember that these age groups at entry into early intervention reflect different groups of children with regard to the nature of their disability or\ndelay. (See 23 \"1 Annual Report to Congress for further details.) Children who began early\nintervention and whose families were interviewed when the child was less than 12 months of age are not just younger than the other two age groups. Children who begin early intervention at less than 12 months of age are much more likely to have a diagnosed condition or a risk condition such as low birth weight. Children older than 12 months are much more likely to have a communication-related disability or delay. Some of the milestone items were too advanced or too young for some age groups and therefore were not asked for these children.\nFor all age groups, the children are advancing developmentally, with significantly\nhigher percentages of children in every age group showing mastery for the\nmilestones shown 1 year after entering early intervention. For the children who were less than 6 months old at entry, for instance, 1 year later, most were able to grasp and let go of objects, crawl, creep or scoot, sit up alone, eat bite-size pieces of food, babble, and play peek-a-boo. However, 1 year later, only about one third were able to walk without holding on to anything, about half could lift a cup and drink from it, and about one fourth of them could repeat or imitate a word.\nFor the children who entered early intervention between 6 and 12 months and\nbetween 12 and 18 months of age, a significant percentage had mastered many of the motor and self-help milestones by 1 year later. For instance, while few of those entering between 6 and 12 months could walk independently at entry, 1 year later over half could do so. For the 12- and 18-month-olds, about one third could walk independently at entry, and nearly three fourths could do so 1 year later. Children in these two age groups also showed progress with communication and cognition\n\n2 3 9\n\nW-23\n\n\f2e Annual Report to Congress\n\nTable IV-7\nMilestone Attainment in Motor and Self-Help Domains of Children Entering Early Intervention and a Year Later by Age Group at Entry to Early Intervention Services\n\nAge group at entry\nN=\nMotor Grasp objects and let go of them (10) Crawl, scoot, or creep (11)\nSit up (11) Pick up small objects with\nfinger and thumb (12) Hold a crayon or pencil\n(16)\nWalk without holding on\n(17) Walk quickly or run (25)\nTake paper off candy to unwrap (25)\n\nPercentage of children reported able to do milestone well\n\n0 to 6\n\n6 to 12\n\n12 to 18\n\n18 to 26\n\nMonths\n\nMonths\n\nMonths\n\nMonths\n\nAt Year At Year At Year At Year entry later entry later entry later entry later\n\n552\n\n465\n\n338\n\n880\n\n99\n\n100\n\n40\n\n90\n\n73\n\n95\n\n95\n\n97\n\n13\n\n82\n\n32\n\n87\n\n86\n\n92\n\n99\n\n99\n\n6\n\n81\n\n39\n\n87\n\n86\n\n91\n\n99\n\n99\n\n8\n\n66\n\n38\n\n75\n\n68\n\n79\n\n84\n\n87\n\n1\n\n28\n\n8\n\n46\n\n28\n\n66\n\n66\n\n76\n\n<1\n\n33\n\n<1\n\n24\n\n4\n\n59\n\n34\n\n73\n\n86\n\n93\n\n2\n\n44\n\n22\n\n61\n\n77\n\n85\n\n<1\n\n11\n\n3\n\n21\n\n10\n\n33\n\n41\n\n58\n\nSelf-Help Eats bite size pieces with fingers (11) Lifts a cup and drinks from it (18) Takes off socks without help (23) Washes and dries hands thoroughly (28)\n\n3\n\n80\n\n31\n\n85\n\n86\n\n92\n\n98\n\n99\n\n1\n\n54\n\n15\n\n62\n\n54\n\n75\n\n86\n\n92\n\n--\n\n--\n\n38\n\n60\n\n64\n\n66\n\n74\n\n80\n\n--\n\n--\n\n--\n\n--\n\n--\n\n34\n\n55\n\nNote:\n\nNs refer to the number in each age group.

A similar pattern of progress can be seen for both of these age groups for the percentages of children who were able to show that they knew at least two body parts.\nNearly all children who entered early intervention between 18 and 26 months had\nmastered milestones in the motor domain by the time they entered early\nintervention. The patterns of mastery for these two domains do show, however, that some of these oldest children have significant delays (e.g., 1 year later, only 58% can take paper off candy to unwrap it; only 80% can take off their socks without help). It is notable, furthermore, that even among these children in the oldest age group, 7% were not walking independently 1 year later. These could well be children with limited use of their legs, some of whom may never walk.\nIn this oldest age group, many of whom entered early intervention because of language and communication delays, a significant number of children showed improvements on communication and cognition milestones. For instance, at entry,\nonly 25% could repeat or imitate a word, but 1 year later, 65% could do so. This is a significant change over time, but there are still about one third of the children in this oldest age group who have not yet attained this language milestone that is reached by almost all children in the general population by 18 months of age. This oldest age group also showed significant gains in the percentage of children who could say two or three words in a sentence and who could give their first name. However, it is also notable that a little more than half of these oldest children still had not attained these two communication milestones. Finally, a significantly higher percentage of these children (78%) were able to engage in simple pretend play 1 year later than they did at entry (57%).\nAcross all four age groups, children were showing progress in mastering key developmental milestones in all of the domains. In future analyses, NEILS will\nexamine how differences in milestone attainment are related to the child's particular disabilities, other child and family characteristics, and the services received. NEILS is also developing composite indices for the four developmental domains that can be used to describe developmental change over time.\nResults for Families\nEarly intervention is a program designed for both children and families. Familycentered practices are mandated as an integral part of early intervention services and are expected to permeate all aspects of service delivery (Bailey, Buysse, Edmondson, & Smith, 1992). To address the need for an approach that could be applied in evaluating family results across many families and programs, Bailey et al. (1998) proposed a general framework for assessing family results. The framework identifies\nW-26\n24 2\n\n\fResults Experienced by Children and Families 1 Year After Beginning Early Intervention\ntwo general types of family results and corresponding questions that reflect current values and the results early intervention could be expected to affect. The two general categories of results are the family's perception of their early intervention experience and of how participation in early intervention services may be affecting their child and family. This framework was used to develop the family outcome measures in NEILS. As with the child outcome data, the NEILS data presented here refer to the family's initial perception of the early intervention experiences and their perceptions\n1 year later.\nNEILS examined a number of issues related to the families' satisfaction with the services they received in early intervention. These data are shown in Table IV-9. The great majority of families were generally pleased with the quality and quantity of the early intervention services they were receiving, both at entry and 1 year later, with few changes over time. Two of the three ratings that showed changes over time were for the group of families whose children were under 6 months old at entry. More of these families rated the quality of therapy services received as excellent 1 year later than they did at entry. In contrast, however, more of these families rated the help and information they received as being fair or poor after 1 year than at entry. The only other significant change over time in families' ratings of the quality or quantity of services was that more of the families of the younger toddlers (12 through 18 months old at entry) wanted more therapy services 1 year later. Overall, these ratings indicate that the majority of families are pleased with the quantity and quality of the services they are receiving both at entry and 1 year later. For the few differences that did occur, future analyses will be conducted to explore the relationships between these family perceptions about services and the actual services the families are\nreceiving.\nNEILS also collected data on the parents' perceptions of their parenting and their ability to work well with professionals (see Table IV-10). Overall, the families begin and remain confident about their ability to care for their child, help the child learn and develop, and understand the child's behavior, as well as how to work well with professionals. Notably, for all four age groups, after 1 year, significantly more families felt confident about their ability to help their child learn and develop. For three of the age groups, 1 year later, more of them felt positive about working with professionals and advocating for their child. Additionally, for families of children who entered between 6 and 12 months, 1 year later, significantly more of them felt that they knew how to go about getting good services if needed.\n1V-27\n243\n\n\f24th Annual Report to Congress\n\nTable IV-9\nFamilies' Satisfaction With Their Early Intervention Services at Entry and a Year Later\n\nAge group at entry\nN = Rating of amount of therapy services\nMore than needed About the right amount Less than needed\n\n0 to 6 Months At Year entry later\n552\n\n2\n\n2\n\n79\n\n80\n\n19\n\n19\n\n6 to 12 Months At Year entry later\n465\n\n2\n\n4\n\n74\n\n72\n\n23\n\n24\n\n12 to 18 Months At Year entry later\n338\n\n8\n\n5\n\n73\n\n69\n\n19\n\n25\n\n18 to 26 Months At Year entry later\n880\n\n3\n\n3\n\n77\n\n78\n\n20\n\n18\n\nQuality of therapy services\n\nExcellent\n\n61\n\n67\n\n61\n\n64\n\n59\n\n54\n\n60\n\n64\n\nGood\n\n33\n\n25\n\n32\n\n27\n\n32\n\n33\n\n35\n\n31\n\nFair or poor\n\n6\n\n7\n\n6\n\n8\n\n9\n\n12\n\n5\n\n5\n\nRating of amount of other\n\nearly intervention services\n\nMore than needed\n\n4\n\n6\n\n2\n\n3\n\n6\n\n3\n\n4\n\n4\n\nAbout the right amount\n\n90\n\n85\n\n83\n\n83\n\n85\n\n92\n\n82\n\n84\n\nLess than needed\n\n5\n\n9\n\n15\n\n14\n\n8\n\n5\n\n13\n\n12\n\nQuality of other early intervention services\nExcellent Good Fair or poor\n\n61\n\n63\n\n43\n\n56\n\n54\n\n45\n\n61\n\n59\n\n35\n\n31\n\n48\n\n40\n\n38\n\n46\n\n34\n\n36\n\n4\n\n6\n\n9\n\n4\n\n8\n\n10\n\n5\n\n5\n\nRating of number of\n\nprofessionals working with\n\nchild\n\nToo many\n\n3\n\n5\n\n4\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n4\n\nAbout the right amount\n\n94\n\n89\n\n86\n\n90\n\n92\n\n89\n\n92\n\n90\n\nNot enough\n\n3\n\n6\n\n10\n\n6\n\n6\n\n9\n\n7\n\n7\n\nRating of help and information family had received\nExcellent Good Fair or poor\n\n56\n\n55\n\n54\n\n52\n\n60\n\n52\n\n58\n\n55\n\n38\n\n36\n\n38\n\n40\n\n32\n\n42\n\n33\n\n34\n\n6\n\n9\n\n9\n\n8\n\n8\n\n6\n\n8\n\n11\n\nNote: Ns refer to the number in each age group.

This is an important area of results because it is hypothesized that early intervention may serve to help families build and make use of the informal social and community support systems available to them. At both entry and 1 year later, the majority of families felt supported by relatives and friends and involved in activities in their communities. It is noteworthy, however, that about one in five families across all age groups at both time points did not feel they had family and friends who help them deal with challenges related to their child's special needs.\nThere were only a few changes over time in perceived support. After 1 year, more of\nthe families whose children were 6-12 months and 12-18 months at entry felt supported by relatives and friends. For the two youngest age groups, 1 year later,\nmore of the families felt that they were able to take part in community activities than they did at the time their children entered early intervention. Once again, future analyses will examine how these family perceptions and changes over time are related to the child's disabilities and functioning and the services received.\nFinally, NEILS asked about the families' perceptions of the impact of early\nintervention on their child and their family and on the child and family's quality of life (Table IV-12). Across all four age groups, 1 year later, more families felt that early intervention had had a lot of impact on their child and their family. Some families had been unable to really judge the impact of services on the child at the first interview, which took place shortly after the child was enrolled in early intervention, but for all four age groups, by 1 year later, two thirds or more of them felt that early intervention had had a lot of impact on their child.\nFamilies were asked to rate the quality of their child's current and future life situation and also the current and future quality of their family's life situation (Table IV-12). For all four age groups, the families were generally optimistic about their child and their family, both currently and in the future. Most of the changes over time for these ratings were for the families whose children entered early intervention under 6 months of age. For these families, 1 year later, more of them were more optimistic. Interestingly, families of children in all groups are hopeful in that they are more optimistic about the future than they are about the present, for both their child and for their family.\n\nIV-30\n\n246\n\n\fResults Experienced by Children and Families 1 Year After Beginning Early Intervention\n\nTable IV-11\nFamilies' Perceptions of Their Family and Community Support at Entry and a Year Later\n\nAge group at entry\nN=\nI have relatives or friends to turn to for help or support when I need it.\nStrongly agree\nAgree Disagree Strongly disagree\n\n0 to 6 Months At Year entry later\n552\n\n63\n\n62\n\n27\n\n29\n\n7\n\n6\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6 to 12 Months At Year entry later\n465\n\n51\n\n57\n\n37\n\n33\n\n8\n\n8\n\n5\n\n3\n\n12 to 18 Months At Year entry later\n338\n\n59\n\n62\n\n31\n\n24\n\n6\n\n10\n\n5\n\n4\n\n18 to 26 Months At Year entry later\n880\n\n56\n\n60\n\n32\n\n28\n\n8\n\n8\n\n3\n\n4\n\nI have relatives, friends, or\n\nothers who help me deal\n\nwith the challenges I face\n\nbecause of child's special\n\nneeds.\nStrongly agree\n\n47\n\n42\n\n37\n\n37\n\n42\n\n44\n\n41\n\n39\n\nAgree Disagree\n\n42\n\n40\n\n40\n\n44\n\n39\n\n38\n\n40\n\n44\n\n6\n\n13\n\n18\n\n15\n\n12\n\n14\n\n13\n\n12\n\nStrongly disagree\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5\n\n4\n\n7\n\n5\n\n6\n\n6\n\nI have little chance to take\n\npart in community\n\nactivities, such as\n\nreligious, school, or social\n\nevents.\n\nStrongly agree Agree Disagree Strongly disagree\n\n22\n\n11\n\n17\n\n14\n\n16\n\n12\n\n11\n\n11\n\n23\n\n27\n\n29\n\n30\n\n24\n\n24\n\n25\n\n24\n\n32\n\n37\n\n39\n\n33\n\n35\n\n37\n\n40\n\n37\n\n23\n\n25\n\n15\n\n23\n\n25\n\n26\n\n25\n\n28\n\nOur ability to work and to\n\nplay together as a family is\n\npretty normal, even though\n\nwe have a child with\n\nspecial needs.\nStrongly agree Agree\n\n55\n\n58\n\n52\n\n54\n\n58\n\n55\n\n55\n\n56\n\n38\n\n37\n\n43\n\n40\n\n38\n\n38\n\n41\n\n38\n\nDisagree\n\n7\n\n4\n\n3\n\n5\n\n4\n\n5\n\n3\n\n5\n\nStrongly disagree\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\nNote: Ns refer to the number in each age group.

One year after entry in early intervention, many children have mastered additional developmental milestones and have shown improvements in their behavior. Families report their child's communication and motor skills have improved, and over two thirds of families report that early intervention has had a lot of impact on the child's development. Most families are satisfied with numerous facets of their early intervention experience when they begin services, including the quantity and quality of services received, and they continued to be satisfied 1 year later. Families are confident about parenting issues and remain confident a year later. More families, however, do report knowing how to help their child learn and develop and how to work with professionals and advocate for their child's needs a year after beginning early intervention. Shortly after they began services, about half the families felt they were much better off because of the help and information provided through early intervention. A year later even more families felt this way.\n\nWhat emerges from these data is a picture of child progress and family satisfaction\n12 months after beginning early intervention. These findings describe the\nexperiences of those children who were 26 months or younger at the first IFSP\nmeeting and could have received approximately a year of early intervention services.\nEven this relatively simple picture is not straightforward since some trends only apply to some age groups which is not surprising given age is a powerful developmental predictor and that age in this population is strongly related to the\nidentification of the nature of the child's disability. Understanding who achieves what\n\nIV-33\n249\n\n\f24th Annual Report to Congress\nresults under what circumstances continues to be one of the primary purposes of the study. Understanding the results of early intervention will continue to get more challenging with time as children age and no longer receive early intervention services. Some of these children will stop receiving services before 36 months of age and others at 36 months. For the children reported on here, those less than 26 months of age at IFSP, one in five were no longer receiving services a year later. Additional NEILS analyses will continue to examine the complex relationship between age of child, age of entry to services, nature of the child's delay or disability, nature of services received, age at exit from services, family characteristics and the results achieved. Forthcoming analyses will look at results when the children are 36 months of age and when they reach kindergarten.\nIV-34\n250\n\n\fResults Experienced by Children and Families 1 Year After Beginning Early Intervention\nReferences\nAdams, P.F., Hendershot, G.E., & Marano, M.A. (1999).

OSEP, a component of the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS), provides grants to state educational agencies (SEA) and lead agencies (LA) according to congressional appropriations to assist in implementation of programs and services; in addition, OSEP provides the states and territories technical assistance, policy support, and monitoring oversight. To accomplish these activities, OSEP works in partnership with states, parents, local service providers, technical assistance providers, institutes of higher education, advocacy groups, professional organizations, and others to provide state and local early intervention providers and educational agencies with scientifically based accurate information and effective tools\ndesigned to assist them in improving results.\nAfter the passage of IDEA '97 that placed greater emphasis on improving results for\nchildren, OSEP began to redesign its monitoring process. The Continuous\nImprovement Monitoring Process (CIMP) incorporated strategies designed to foster greater state accountability, increase parental involvement, establish a data-driven\nprocess to inform improvement planning, and ensure public awareness and dissemination. The CIMP activities focus around groupings of required activities under the IDEA called \"cluster areas.\" The cluster areas for Part B are: Free Appropriate Public Education in the Least Restrictive Environment, Parental\nInvolvement, Secondary Transition, and General Supervision. For Part C, the cluster\nareas are Child Find and Public Awareness, Early Intervention Services in the Natural Environment, Family Centered Services, Early Childhood Transition, and General Supervision. The cluster areas contain objectives, components, indicators, and potential state and local data sources for measuring progress in the\nimplementation of IDEA in each of the aforementioned cluster areas.\nOSEP initiated the CIMP with the 12 states scheduled for on-site monitoring visits in 1998-1999. Table IV-13 below provides a schedule of states' involvement in the\nCIMP. In 1998-2000, the CIMP consisted of seven phases: self-assessment,\nvalidation planning, validation data collection, improvement planning, implementation of improvement strategies, verification and consequences, and review and revision of the self-assessment. States established steering committees,\nrepresenting both Part B and Part C constituents that participated in the development of a self-assessment submitted to OSEP. The self-assessment\nIV-37\n252\n\n\f24'' Annual Report to Congress\n\npresented the status of the state's implementation and results for both programs. During 1998-1999 and 1999-2000, OSEP traveled to 21 states to conduct focused public input meetings prior to conducting an on-site data collection visit. In a report describing the on-site data collection visit, OSEP identified areas of noncompliance, suggestions for improved results, and promising practices in the state. OSEP and the state steering committee assisted the SEA and LA in each state in developing an Improvement Plan that addressed both identified noncompliance issues and other areas in need of improvement. States that failed to correct noncompliance identified\nby OSEP in the on-site data collection visit were subject to enforcement actions such\nas OSEP-directed corrective actions, special conditions on grant awards, or\ncompliance agreements.\n\nTable IV-13 Schedule of States' Continuous Improvement Monitoring Process\n\n1998-1999\nSelf-Assessment, On-site Data Collection,\nImprovement Plan Arizona Bureau of Indian\nAffairs (Part B Only) Massachusetts Montana Nebraska New Mexico New York North Dakota South Dakota Utah Washington Wisconsin\n\n1999-2000 Self-Assessment, Onsite Data Collection,\nImprovement Plan Arkansas Colorado Florida Hawaii Louisiana Maryland New Jersey Ohio Pennsylvania\n\n2000-2001 Self-Assessment, *On-\nSite Data Collection, Improvement Plan Connecticut *District of Columbia Delaware Georgia Idaho *Illinois *Iowa Michigan Minnesota New Hampshire *Puerto Rico (Part C Only) *South Carolina *Texas Virginia Wyoming\n\n2001-2002 Self-Assessment, Improvement Plan Alabama California Indiana Kentucky Nevada North Carolina Oklahoma Oregon Rhode Island Tennessee\n\nSource: U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education Programs, Division of Monitoring and State Improvement Planning.\n\nDuring the summers of 2000 (in Salt Lake City and Chicago) and 2001 (in Seattle and\nAtlanta), OSEP and the OSEP-funded Regional Resource Centers (RRCs) and the National Early Childhood Technical Assistance System (NECTAS), conducted\ninstitutes to provide states with information about the self-assessment and improvement planning processes. Generally, a team from each state attended the\n\nIV-38\nBEST COPY AVAILABLE 2,53\n\n\fState Improvement and Monitoring\ninstitutes. State teams included representatives from the SEAs and LAs, parents, state Steering Committee, and others.\nIn 2000, OSEP modified several aspects of the CIMP. The modifications were based on what OSEP had learned from 2 years of implementing CIMP and from informal input from state directors and coordinators. These modifications also reflected a response to the report issued by the National Council on Disability (NCD) entitled \"Back to School on Civil Rights,\" which documents that no state is currently in compliance with the IDEA, and OSEP monitoring needed to change to address this national noncompliance.\nAccountability. During 1998-2000, information about a state's implementation practices was collected primarily through OSEP public input and on-site data collection visits. OSEP then reported strengths and weaknesses to the state. Mandated areas for the state to address in a corrective action plan were addressed by OSEP in the monitoring reports. After 2000, the states, through their self-assessment and comprehensive planning activities in active collaboration with OSEP, have assumed shared accountability for the identification of issues needing improvement, including areas of noncompliance identified through a comprehensive review of evidence conducted by stakeholders.\nPublic Involvement. In 1998-2000, public input during OSEP's monitoring and oversight activities primarily involved OSEP-directed public meetings. Since 2000, OSEP, states, state Steering Committees and OSEP-funded\ntechnical assistance providers (RRCs and NECTAS) are working in\npartnership to share information and solicit public input into the monitoring process. The expanded involvement of other constituents has led to greater\npublic awareness of the states' implementation issues and to enhanced partnerships between OSEP, states, technical assistance providers, and other\nkey stakeholders.\nFocus. Prior to 1997, IDEA focused on process and procedural requirements in its monitoring efforts. The 1997 amendments of IDEA\nplaced emphasis on accountability and results for children. OSEP, during 1998-2000, looked at a combination of process and procedural requirements when conducting an on-site data collection visit. After 2000, OSEP focused on the elements of a state's implementation of IDEA with the strongest relationship to positive results for children such as participation in state- and district-wide assessments and access to the general curriculum. OSEP's procedures now emphasize results by looking at documented performance data in those areas.\nIV-39\n254\n\n\f24\"' Annual Report to Congress\nScope. Prior to 1998, OSEP selected states for a comprehensive visit on a cyclical basis. During 1998-2000, states were selected for an on-site data collection visit based on indicators suggesting that a state may have systemic problems implementing the IDEA. The indicators included last data monitored, previous noncompliance, number of infants and toddlers served in Part C, graduation rates for children with disabilities, and dropout rates. The specific issues for examination during an on-site monitoring visit were determined through an analysis of information obtained from the states' selfassessment and the validation planning (public input) sessions. In 2000, OSEP moved to an approach based on information obtained through statereported data and through self-assessment, including public input, and results of improvement planning. Careful consideration is given to an analysis of several factors, including previous history of compliance within the state, successful efforts of the state in correcting noncompliance, and likelihood of suggested improvement strategies being implemented which lead to positive results for children. Of the 15 states that submitted a self-assessment in 2000, OSEP made on-site data collection visits to six (see Table IV-13). OSEP visited other states to assist Steering Committees and SEA/LA staff develop improvement plans using the CIMP monitoring model.\nImprovement. Prior to 1998, OSEP required states to develop and\nimplement corrective action plans (CAPs) to address noncompliance issues\nand to report to MSIP the results of the implementation efforts. The activities included in CAPS were often procedural in nature and may not have demonstrated direct impact leading to improved results for children.\nBeginning in 1998, states were required to develop improvements plans that, at a minimum, address areas of noncompliance and measure the effect of improvement strategies on improved results for children. In addition, the CIMP is fostering state ownership of areas needing improvement identified at the state level by stakeholders and a shared partnership between SEAs, LAs, local educational agencies (LEAs), and stakeholders, leading to accountability for improving results for children and their families\nTechnical assistance and support. Prior to 1998, staff of MSIP, RRCs,\nand NECTAS individually responded to states' requests for assistance. Since 1998, the staffs of OSEP, RRCs and NECTAS are working in a coordinated\nframework to provide ongoing support and guidance to the state in their involvement in CIMP as well as responding to specific state requests for technical assistance. The process is moving toward OSEP, RRCs, and NECTAS coordinating with other Federal, state, and regional technical assistance networks to provide comprehensive support to states in diagnosing system deficiencies, implementing improvement strategies, and\nIV-40\n255\n\n\fState Improvement and Monitoring\nevaluating the effects of those efforts in demonstrating improved results for children in the Parts C and B programs under the IDEA.\nConsequences. As previously discussed, prior to 1998, states developed CAPs with activities designed to correct areas of noncompliance identified by OSEP during an on-site monitoring visit. Since 1998, all states are developing improvement plans to address issues identified in their self-assessments. Some states are involved in OSEP data collection visits designed to identify areas of noncompliance. OSEP is visiting other states for improvement planning purposes, including assisting the states in filling data gaps, identifying system barriers, verifying conflicting data, or determining the need for an enforcement action. Some states visited by OSEP have compliance agreements or special conditions under their IDEA grant award. The CIMP is moving toward a system of positive and negative consequences, ensuring that all states have an improvement plan focused on accountability to demonstrate improved results for infants, toddlers, children and youth with\ndisabilities and their families.\nState Part B and Part C staff, parents, members of steering committees, and OSEP staff presented \"lessons learned\" at the 2001 summer institute. Collectively, the\npanels were successful in providing insights to states on how to effectively\nimplement CIMP. Comments of the panelists included:\n\"Our state learned lessons about holes in our data. We had a lot of data but not all of it was valid. We are now doing a better job with data collection, and mining it more thoroughly than before.\"\n\"Collaboration between Parts C and B have been strengthened considerably through these efforts.\"\n'We used public data to validate and triangulate quantitative data. That\nstrengthened the conclusions we could draw.\"\n\"The process helps to focus on what priorities are important and how it is connected to other efforts.\"\n\"Unanticipated result has been accountability to [state advisory] council on quality of improvement plan.\"\nIV-41\n256\n\n\f24(1' Annual Report to Congress\n\"It's very good to have parents participating in all activities as key\nstakeholders.\"\n\"Opportunity to get parents involved in self-assessment and planning the effort. Will lead to significant systems change. Involvement from OSEP has been very powerful. OSEP has been a real collaborative partner in the process.\"\n\"This is the state's work; it's part of what states do, not something added on.\"\nOSEP is assisting states in completing a self-assessment, designing and implementing effective improvement planning, and obtaining data to support program\naccountability, OSEP's future technical assistance efforts with states will be\nconcentrated on three primary activities:\nAssistance in analyzing barriers to achieving results. OSEP and states\nhave successfully gathered data to demonstrate the results achieved through\nIDEA implementation in the state. For example, states gather data to indicate the number of students with disabilities who drop out of school. If the number of dropouts exceeds the state's goal, the state develops and implements activities to ensure that students with disabilities remain in school until receipt of a regular diploma. The challenge for a state is in identifying the factors that cause students to drop out. Activities leading to\ndecreasing the dropout rate would differ if the reason for a high dropout rate is that the students have been placed in regular classrooms without supports and services necessary to ensure student success; if the school climate does not encourage students with more significant disabilities to participate in school activities; or the state law permits a student to drop out at an early age prior to receiving the standard diploma. The analysis of the barriers to achieving the desired result is a critical factor in designing effective strategies to ensure successful implementation of the IDEA. OSEP, the RRCs, and NECTAS are currently working with states to develop procedures to assist in identifying barriers to achieving successful IDEA implementation. While states and their steering committees have flexibility in designing improvement strategies, OSEP is reviewing improvement plans to ensure that states are addressing, as appropriate, a range of implementation barriers, including state and local administration factors, personnel issues, and procedural errors. By understanding and documenting barriers, states can then identify evidence-based strategies designed to remove these barriers, thereby improving accountability for results.\nIV-42\n\n\fState Improvement and Monitoring\nAssistance in designing, implementing, and evaluating improvement planning. OSEP provides states assistance and guidance in developing, implementing, and evaluating improvement plans. After an analysis of barriers to achieving positive results and development of an improvement plan reasonably designed to address the identified issue, the state must conduct an evaluation of the effects of the strategies implemented. Benchmarks contained in the state's improvement plan enable the state to\nensure that the improvement strategies selected and implemented achieve the desired results. OSEP is working closely with states and their steering committees to ensure that appropriate methods of data gathering are used to provide information about the success of their improvement plans. States must gather data on the impact and effect of the activity, not just data on the effort. For example, if training is used as an improvement strategy, the state should not rely solely on data such as attendance to indicate success. The state must design and implement strategies to gather \"impact\" data such as changes in practices that resulted from training activities. The impact data indicate if the identified benchmarks are met. If states are unable to reach an\nestablished \"benchmark,\" they must work with OSEP to revise the\nimprovement plan, constantly monitoring progress designed to ensure\nimproved accountability for results.\nOSEP technical assistance and funded technical assistance providers. OSEP is increasing its capacity to help states identify issues that need improvement, barriers to achieving positive results for children and their\nfamilies, and strategies to evaluate the effects of implemented improvement strategies. OSEP's internal planning process gives strong consideration to monitoring findings as well as issues identified by states' self-assessments in determining funding priorities for subsequent fiscal years. OSEP's Research to Practice (RTP) and MSIP Divisions are forging stronger links so that state\ncontacts in MSIP use information from project officers in RTP to\ndisseminate best practice and current research information to states. MSIP and RTP recently established crosscutting workgroups in specialized areas (early childhood, secondary transition, personnel) to ensure a coordinated approach to providing states information on evidence-based practices and technical assistance. OSEP has completed a pilot of a model for providing\ncomprehensive technical assistance to states using MSIP and RTP staff combined with OSEP-funded technical assistance, research, and outreach\nprojects.\n\n\f24111 Annual Report to Congress\nThrough analyses of monitoring reports from OSEP's on-site monitoring visits during 1998-99 and 1999-00 and information from OSEP's ongoing work with SEA and LA staff and document reviews, OSEP has identified some major systemic challenges for Part B and Part C programs which must be successfully addressed to ensure accountability for improved results throughout the United States.\nServices to Infants and Toddlers Under Part C\nThe CIMP process has documented the fact that significant challenges remain for state LAs in administering Part C programs. Many states have not implemented an effective interagency system of care for young children with disabilities and their\nfamilies. States have established a program of early intervention services\nadministered by an LA. However, in many states, OSEP has observed two or more state programs designed to serve infants and toddlers, usually administered by different state agencies, operating side-by-side with little or no coordination. Only children served by the lead agency are reported to OSEP as receiving services. This practice may contribute to a depressed national count of children receiving services under Part C. Another potential outcome of this documented fragmentation in the service delivery system for infants and toddlers with disabilities is that all children may not be receiving services to meet all their identified needs if either program does not offer the full array of needed services. A lack of coordination among programs in a state may also lead to other systemic issues, including ineffective utilization of fiscal resources, families not receiving the procedural safeguards to which they are entitled under Part C, duplicative service provision and processes, and confusion for providers. States are beginning to address these concerns through establishment of more inclusive steering committees, greater public input into identification of issues that need to be addressed in creating effective infant and toddler service systems, and strategies for improvement. States are developing improvement strategies to coordinate services to children and their families. The creation of shared, interagency data systems is allowing state programs to collaborate in making programmatic decisions based on knowledge of all state resources and to avoid duplicative activities. This enhanced collaboration will result in increased accountability for results and maximization of resource utilization in Part C programs.\nOne challenge for states is to develop and implement effective state general\nsupervision and administration practices, specifically in the monitoring and oversight of programs providing early intervention services to eligible children and families. An analysis of the results of the OSEP on-site monitoring in 20 states from the 19981999 and 1999-2000 monitoring cycles indicates challenges that remain in this area.\nEleven (55%) of the states had monitoring procedures that were ineffective in\nMonitoring reports are available online at http://www.ed.gov/offices/OSERS/OSEP or by writing to the OSEP Director at the Department of Education.\nW-44\n25 9\n\n\fState Improvement and Monitoring\nidentifying noncompliance issues or did not address all the Part C requirements. Two (10%) of the states had monitoring procedures that identified noncompliance, but the states has not been effective in ensuring correction of the identified issues. Four\n(20%) of the states had procedures that did not include the monitoring of all\nprograms used by the state to provide early intervention services. The programs not being monitored were usually programs administered by a state agency other than\nthe L.A. This lack of monitoring data is a barrier to states in conducting a\ncomprehensive self-assessment and developing improvement plans that will assist in improving results for young children and their families. OSEP is currently working with these states to develop effective monitoring procedures, explore strategies for interagency monitoring, utilize the results of monitoring to inform state staff and\nsteering committees about implementation issues, and develop improvement\nstrategies to ensure the correction of issues identified by state or Federal monitoring\nactivities, leading to increased accountability for results.\nChild Find efforts continue to be a challenge in some states. Seven (35%) of the states were found in noncompliance for the lack of effective statewide systems to ensuring Child Find efforts were coordinated among state agencies. Nine (45%) of these states did not have effective Child Find or public awareness programs. Five (25%) were not disseminating Child Find materials to primary referral sources. These states were not ensuring that physicians and other critical primary referral sources refer children to the state's early intervention program in a timely manner. OSEP continues to hear from parents that their child's physician told them to \"wait and see\" after the parents expressed concerns about their child's development. OSEP is working with states to examine the population of children served through the Part C program to determine if the population of children served reflects the demographics of their state and to ensure that all segments of the population are gaining access to services. The 1998-2000 states that were cited for noncompliance in Child Find have made significant progress in identifying eligible children. The 1998-1999 states were serving an average of 1.13% of the general population at the time of OSEP's visit. In December 2000, the 1998-1999 states were serving an average of 1.57%. The 19992000 states have made similar gains. At the time of OSEP's visit, the 1999-2000 states were serving 2.18% of the general population of infants and toddlers in the state. In December 2000, an average of 2.59% was being served in the 1999-2000 states. OSEP's work with states is leading to the implementation of coordinated, interagency Child Find and public awareness activities resulting in an increased\nnumber of children receiving services.\nService coordination remains a significant challenge for states in implementing their Part C program. A majority (55%) of the states visited during 1998-2000 were not implementing the Federal service coordination requirements. In many of these states,\nthe failure to complete service coordination functions was attributed to high\ncaseloads. Families reported to OSEP that they must coordinate their own services.\n\n260\n\nIV-45\n\n\f241k Annual Report to Congress\nThe documented failure to provide effective service coordination may affect the state's compliance in other areas. For example, one required service coordination activity is facilitating and participating in the development, review, and evaluation of individualized family service plans (IFSP5). In the monitored states, 11 (55%) were found in noncompliance with requirements related to the development of IFSPs, including the failure to identify and provide services designed to meet the unique needs of the child and family. Another service coordination activity is the coordination of evaluations and assessments. Thirty percent (30%) of these states had not ensured the timely completion of evaluations and assessments in the required areas. OSEP is working with states to gather data to determine if service coordinators are fulfilling their responsibilities and if not, determine the barriers. Once this evidence-based process is completed, OSEP will help provide technical assistance to states targeted to remove these barriers and improve accountability for\nresults.\nStates continue to concentrate on establishing procedures to ensure a \"seamless\" transition from Part C to Part B or other appropriate services. The early childhood transition requirements are not being fully implemented in some states, with transition during the spring or summer months being especially difficult. Sixty percent of the states monitored between 1998-2000 were not including transition steps in the IFSPs or convening transition conferences at least 90 days before the child's third birthday. OSEP is working with states to develop procedures to ensure that effective transition occurs, including the development of shared data systems to track children as they move successfully through transition activities required by Part C.\nThe identification and provision of services and supports to enhance families' capacity to meet the developmental needs of their children is a challenge in some states. Over one-third (35%) of the 1998-2000 states had failed to identify family needs and services on the IFSPs. In addition, families in many states told OSEP they did not have an opportunity to participate in planning and evaluation activities in their states. OSEP is working with states to implement family-directed assessments that will identify supports and services needed to enhance family capacity. OSEP is encouraging states to ensure that parents and other family members, including\nfamilies from culturally and linguistically diverse populations, become full partners in policymaking, planning, and training activities at the state and local levels.\n\nIV-46\n\n2 61\n\n\fState Improvement and Monitoring\nServices to Children and Youth Under Part B\nAs indicated by the results of the on-site monitoring visits to 21 states during 19982000, SEAs continue to identify challenges in the area of general supervision and administration of programs. More than one-fifth (24%) were identified as not\nimplementing the Part B complaint resolution requirements within required\ntimelines. Fifty-seven percent were not implementing an effective monitoring system that identifies all systemic noncompliance by local school districts. Fifty-four percent of states monitored had not ensured the correction of noncompliance identified through their complaint and monitoring systems. OSEP is assisting these states to develop/modify monitoring procedures and to implement complaint procedures that meet Federal requirements to ensure compliance designed to enhance accountability for results.\nChallenges for states in ensuring FAPE include issues related to provision of counseling, psychological services, speech language therapy, occupational and physical therapy and other related services to students who need those services to benefit from special education. A majority (57%) of the 1998-00 states had not\nensured the provision of one or more related services, with counseling\nservices/psychological counseling being the most common service not being provided. In 43% of the states, shortages of teachers and related services providers contribute to a failure to provide needed special education services, including the provision of extended school year services. Twenty percent of the states were not providing adequate supports for enabling students with disabilities to access the\ngeneral curriculum and learn in regular education classrooms; 20% of the states were not including students with disabilities in state and district assessments.\nForty-seven percent of the states were not addressing the secondary transition requirements on students' individual education programs (IEPs). Representatives of other agencies likely to be responsible for providing or paying for transition services were not invited to IEP meetings in 34% of the states. Students were not invited to IEP meetings when postschool transition was discussed in 24% of the states monitored. OSEP is assisting SEAs in designing secondary transition processes to address Federal requirements, tracking the impact of successful implementation of secondary transition procedures, and establishing collaborative relationships with other agencies that are involved with postsecondary programs for young adults with\ndisabilities.\nEven though only 3 of the 21 (14%) states monitored in 1998-2000 were in\nnoncompliance with the requirements related to parents attending IEP meetings or participating in placement decisions, maintaining active involvement of parents in their children's educational programs continues to be a priority in many states. SEA\n\n262\n\nW-47\n\n\f24' Annual Report to Congress\nstaff report to OSEP that the participation of parents from underrepresented\nsegments of the population is especially problematic. States are currently developing strategies designed to increase parental involvement in developing educational programs for children and in advisory and policymaking groups at state and local levels. Many are entering into partnerships with Parent Training and Information Centers (PTIs) and other parent groups to provide training to parents, to foster parent-professional partnerships, and to conduct parent leadership forums. States are utilizing parents as trainers or co-trainers for staff development activities in school districts as part of an effort to improve the quality of professional development activities conducted by schools. To assist states in meeting these challenges, MSIP continues to work in partnership with SEAs, LAs, steering committees, RTP, external-funded technical assistance providers, and others to enhance efforts currently used in collecting and analyzing data and developing improvement plans that will ensure positive outcomes for\nchildren with disabilities and their families. Implementation of the CIMP has\nincreased accountability of states, ensured public involvement and input, focused on processes with the strongest relationship to positive results, created mechanisms for\nmaking data-driven decisions, and increased emphasis on accountability for\nimproving results for children with disabilities and their families.\nIV-48\n263\n\n\fAPPENDIX A DATA TABLES\nThis Appendix includes a compilation and analysis of data gathered on children with disabilities served under IDEA and reference data on all school-aged children. As required by IDEA, the Part B data tables include child count (2000-01), placement (1999-2000), personnel (1999-2000), and exiting (1999-2000). Data on infants and toddlers served in accordance with IDEA, Part C are also included. Finally, data on estimated resident population for children ages 3 through 21, total enrollment for students in prekindergarten through 12th grade, and state grant awards under IDEA are provided. Several tables report\nnational totals only.

A significant increase in the number of American Indian/Alaska Native students ages 6 through 21 during the same reporting period supports the explanation.\nArizonaThe state attributed the increases from 1999-2000 to 2000-01 in the\nnumber of students with autism and traumatic brain injury (T131) to a change in the state's reporting system. The state changed the crosswalk it uses to translate the multiple disability categories it collects for each student to the IDEA disability categories. This was done to make the data more closely align with the IDEA disability categories.\nColoradoThe state attributed the increase from 1999-2000 to 2000-01 in the number of students with autism to the increased training the state has provided to\nlocal education agencies (LEAs) in identifying students with autism.\nFloridaThe state attributed the increase from 1999-2000 to 2000-01 in the\nnumber of students with other health impairments to the growth in the number of children identified with attention deficit disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD/ADHD) and children identified with Asperger's syndrome.\nKentuckyThe state attributed the increase in other health impairments to an\nincrease in the number of students served with ADD/ADHD.\nMinnesotaThe state attributed the increase in the number of children served with autism to the success of early intervention programs within the state.\nMontanaThe state attributed the increase from 1999-2000 to 2000-01 in the number of children with autism served to the implementation of the state early intervention program. Montana attributes the increase in the developmental delay\ncategory to the fact that the category has been used for only 2 years.\nNew JerseyThe state indicated that in 1998, a change in state regulations\nredefined the state category \"neurologically impaired\" exclusively as the Federal category TBI. This change has resulted in a huge increase in New Jersey's and the Nation's TBI figures. In the past, the previous combination of \"neurologically impaired\" and \"perceptually impaired\" was reported under the Federal \"specific learning disability\" category. New Jersey indicated that most of the neurologically impaired pupils will eventually be reevaluated and classified under specific learning disability, communication impairments, some other category, or declassified as not eligible for special education. To provide consistency in these data over time, the numbers reported here have been projected based on previous New Jersey reporting\npatterns.\n\nA-476\n\n73 9\n\n\fThe state attributed the increase in students with autism to a change in the definition to include in the autism category students with onset after age 3 and also children with Asperger's syndrome.\nNew YorkThe state noted that race/ethnicity data for students with disabilities will not be submitted this school year. In addition, New York noted that it does not classify preschool students with disabilities by disability category. The state uses\nestimates to report the disability categories of 3- to 5-year-olds.\nNorth CarolinaThe state noted that seven charter schools failed to submit data\nand therefore are not included in the child count.\nOklahomaThe state indicated that the increases in other health impairments and autism are consistent with the increases reported in these categories over the last 3 to 4 years. The state continued to provide training and technical assistance in identifying and reporting other health impairments and autism, and as a result there is much more awareness and better recognition of students with these disabilities.\nOregonThe state noted that its age ranges are different from the OSEP\ndefinitions. Children who are 5 years old on September 1 are considered to be school age and, therefore, are included in the counts for the 6-through-21 age group rather than the 3-through-5 age group.\nUtahThe state indicated that the increase in the number of students served with autism was due to a more accurate collection system. In addition, the state noted that two districts collected and submitted erroneous information in last year's data submission. The state also indicated that improved training in the area of autism identification has resulted in an increase in the number of autistic children served\nand reported.\nWisconsinThe state attributed the increase in the number of autistic children\nserved and reported to its autism training program.\nTables AB1-AB11: Educational Environments\nAlabamaThe state attributed some of the increase in the number of children ages 3 through 5 served in an early childhood special education setting and part-time early childhood/part-time early childhood special education setting, and the decreases in the number served in an early childhood setting and separate school setting, to coding errors in last year's report. The state also suggests that the changes in the educational environments categories are the result of more students ages 3 through 21 being served in less restrictive environments within the state.\n\n74 0\n\nA-477\n\n\fArkansasThe state attributed the decrease in the number of students served in private residential facilities to the new policy of reclassifying students receiving services at the following facilities: (a) the Arkansas School of the Deaf, (b) the\nArkansas School of the Blind, and (c) the Arkansas Department of Human Services. These students are now placed in the public residential facilities category.\nArizonaThe state reported that the home and part-time early childhood categories were transposed in the 1998-99 submission. The state also noted that its current definition for part-time early childhood includes the reverse mainstream setting. Next school year, the state will provide data for the reverse mainstream setting\nseparately.\nBureau of Indian MfairsThe Bureau reported that the data for children ages 3\nthrough 5 only include those children whose tribe has contracted with a BIA-funded school to provide services.\nColoradoThe state was unable to report race/ethnicity data for children ages 3\nthrough 5.\nConnecticutThe state noted that for the second year, data for students ages 6\nthrough 21 are a duplicate count of students with disabilities served in correctional facilities and children enrolled in private schools, not placed by the local district. In the past, these numbers were reported as unduplicated counts. Students classified as \"other\" race/ethnicity were distributed proportionately by disability.\nDistrict of ColumbiaThe state was unable to provide data about the educational environments of children ages 3 through 5.\nIllinoisThe state noted that some of its definitions regarding least restrictive\nenvironment do not match the Federal definitions. For example, those students who are reported as being in resource classrooms may be receiving services in the resource room from 1 percent to 49 percent of the school day. Additionally, the count for students in separate classes includes students receiving special education and related services for 50 percent or more of the school day.\nNew JerseyThe state attributes the differences in the number of children served in itinerant services outside the home from 1998-99 to 1999-2000 to a change in collection methodology. In 1998-99, students receiving speech for fewer than 3 hours a week were reported in part-time early childhood general education/part-time early childhood special education. This year, the students were reported in the\nitinerant services category.\nNew MexicoThe state attributed the changes from 1998-99 to 1999-2000 to the use of a new data collection system and a change in collection methodology. The state went from a special-education-only data collection to a unified data collection for special education and regular education.\n\nA-478\n\n741\n\n\fNew YorkThe state noted that race/ethnicity data reported for children ages 3\nthrough 5 are for all students receiving \"preschool special education services,\" not for all children ages 3 through 5. Race/ethnicity data provided for students ages 6\nthrough 21 are for all students with disabilities receiving \"school-age special\neducation services,\" not for all students ages 6 through 21. There was no duplication between the two tables, and all students ages 3 through 21 with disabilities are reported by race/ethnicity.\nNorth CarolinaThe state noted that seven charter schools failed to submit data\nand therefore are not included in the environment counts.\nOhioThe state noted that the settings data for ages 3 through 5 were not correct\nfor 1998-99 and that this year's numbers are correct.\nOregonThe state noted its age ranges are different from the OSEP definitions. Children who are 5 years old on September 1 are considered to be school age and, therefore, are included in the counts for the 6-through-21 age group rather than the\n3-through-5 age group.\nPennsylvaniaThe state attributed the changes in the educational environments\ndata from 1998-99 to 1999-2000 to its new data collection system.\nTexasThe state noted that educational environment data will not be available for children ages 3 through 5 until school year 2000-01. The state also noted that its definitions do not match those used by the Federal data collection. Therefore, the figures reported to OSEP and reflected in the charts for several categories are estimates. The impact was especially significant for the following categories: (a) special education outside regular class less than 21 percent of day, (b) special education outside regular class at least 21 percent of day and no more than 60 percent of day, and (c) special education outside regular class more than 60 percent of day. Likewise, the Texas definition of self-contained includes those students receiving 50 percent or more of their school day in special education settings outside of the regular classroom. The Federal definition for category c uses 60 percent as the cutoff. Therefore, those students in Texas receiving more than 50 percent through 60 percent of their instructional day in special education are included in category c for Federal reporting purposes even though, if data were available, they could be reported in category b. The state is revising the data collection to capture specific elements as required by OSEP definitions for future collections.\nTables AC1-AC3: Personnel\nArizonaThe state attributed the increase in state education agency (SEA)\nsupervisors/administrators to a misinterpretation of the category in previous years.\n\n74 2\n\nA-479\n\n\fArkansasThe state attributed the variation between the 1998-99 and the 1999-\n2000 data to errors in the reporting of noncertified diagnostic and evaluation staff.\nIllinoisThe state did not collect personnel data by ages served and therefore was able to report only the number of teaching personnel serving early childhood or preschool students. All other personnel, including those who may be serving children ages 3 through 5, are reported as serving students ages 6 through 21. The state also does not collect full-time equivalency (FTE) data for home-hospital personnel. As a result, these personnel are not included in the data.\nNebraskaThe state attributed the variations in the number of supervisors/ administrators from 1998-99 to 1999-2000 to a change in the data collection methodology. Prior to this year, FTEs were not used to report supervisors and\nadministrators.\nNew MexicoThe state attributed the large variations in the personnel table from 1998-99 to 1999-2000 to a change in the data collection methodology. Prior to 19992000, the state's data collection used a paper and pencil format and allowed \"estimates\" of FTE for certain staff. The state now collects its data electronically and does not allow estimates.\nNorth CarolinaThe state noted that seven charter schools failed to submit data and therefore are not included in the personnel counts.\nOhioThe state attributed the changes in the number of diagnostic and evaluation staff, interpreters, speech pathologists, as well as in total demand to hiring increases within the categories and more accurate reporting. In the past, Ohio reported speech pathologists in two separate categories. This year, all speech-language pathologists are reported within the speech pathologists category. The state also attributed the increase in total personnel to increased hiring within the personnel categories teachers, teacher assistants, other professional staff, and nonprofessional staff. The latter two categories, which represent 1,000 positions, were not reported before this\nyear.\nPennsylvaniaThe state attributed the variations in the personnel data from 199899 to 1999-2000 to a change in data collection procedures. In 1999-2000, the personnel data were collected for the first time in an aggregate manner.\nTexasThe state attributed the variations in personnel from 1998-99 to 1999-2000 to a decision for the 1999-2000 data collection to report school social workers, diagnostic and evaluation staff, and counselors as fully certified when certification cannot be determined through the state Board Education Certification (SBEC). In 1998-99, certification for the above three roles was determined by matching with the SBEC database.\nA-480\n743\n\n\fUtahThe state attributed the increase from 1998-99 to 1999-2000 in the number of interpreters to an increase in hiring for that category. In addition, the state noted that it does not have a certification program for aides.\nWisconsinThe state attributed the increase in the number of fully certified\ndiagnostic and evaluation staff to districts incorrectly reporting program support teachers as teachers last year. This year, they are correctly included as diagnostic and evaluation staff, resulting in an increase in this category. The decrease in the not fully certified diagnostic and evaluation staff category was the result of continuing license\nchecks.\nTables AD1 AD4: Exiting\nBureau of Indian AffairsThe Bureau believes that some of the students ages 14 and 15 years old who were reported as graduated with a diploma may not have graduated from high school, but rather they graduated from middle school or junior high school. BIA has noted this mistake and will inform the local district to correct this problem in future submissions.\nConnecticutThe state attributed the increases in the number of students no\nlonger receiving special education and the decreases in dropouts to a change in the data collection methodology.\nIllinoisThe state reported that it is still having problems collecting and reporting exiting data. The state attributed the differences in the data from 1998-99 to 19992000 to problems with the data collection system.\nGeorgiaThe state indicated that the increases in total exits from 1998-99 to 19992000 were the result of its new web-based data system. Georgia believes that the data are now more reliable. The state also noted that the special education population was increasing at a significant rate, and the changes in the data reflect this growth.\nMissouriThe state noted that all of the increases in the moved, known to be\ncontinuing and dropped out categories are attributed to the Missouri Department of Corrections (MDC) exiting report. The state indicated that the MDC's exiting data fluctuate from year to year.\nNew YorkThe state reported that the increase in the number of students exiting with a diploma suggests that more and more students with disabilities are participating in the state assessments, which they are required to pass to graduate.\nOhioThe state suspects that the number of students reported in the reached\nmaximum age category is inflated for 1999-2000. Ohio will address the discrepancies in the 2000-01 data.\n\n74 4\n\nA-481\n\n\fPennsylvaniaThe state attributed the changes in the exiting data from 1998-99 to 1999-2000 to its new data collection system.\nTexasEach fall, the state collects exiting data for the previous year. Data reported for school year 1999-2000 are actually for students exiting in 1998-99.\nWashingtonThe state's exiting data are for school year 1998-99.\nTables AE1-AE4: Discipline\nArizonaThe state attributed the increase in the number of students reported in the category removed by a hearing officer to a change in collection methodology. The decrease in removal by school personnel and in weapons offenses is being\nattributed to the state's \"zero tolerance\" policy.\nArkansasThe state noted that the increase in the number of short-term\nsuspensions and in the unduplicated count of children subject to unilateral removal are attributed to this being a new data collection. This was only the second year that the districts were required to report discipline data, and the data manager believes some of the information may be incorrect.\nBureau of Indian AffairsThe Bureau noted that the race/ethnicity data do not match the computed totals. The Bureau further noted that it is unable to correct the\nerror and attributed the year-to-year differences to the newness of the collection and to problems collecting the data at the district level.\nCaliforniaThe state noted that the variation from the previous year in the\nunduplicated count of children subject to unilateral removal was due to an error in reporting last year's data.\nDelawareThe state noted that variations in all the discipline data from 1998-99 to 1999-2000 are the result of incomplete data reported for 1998-99.\nKentuckyThe state attributed the changes in the discipline data from 1998-99 to 1999-2000 to the new data collection system. The state further noted that reporting discipline data remains problematic for Kentucky because reporting covers the entire year, and the same student may have multiple incidents to be reported. Kentucky does not have an individual student record system.\nLouisianaThe state was unable to report an unduplicated count of children\nsubject to unilateral removal for drug or weapon offenses.\nMassachusettsThe state attributed year-to-year changes in the discipline data to a new data system and more accurate reporting in 1999-2000.\n\nA-482\n\n74 5\n\n\fMissouriThe state indicated that variations in the discipline data from 1998-99 to 1999-2000 are the result of reporting some categories for the first time. In 1998-99, disability by condition and race/ethnicity were optional categories in the discipline collection, and Missouri did not report them.\nNew MexicoThe state noted that the discipline data are still collected on a paper and pencil form because the state has not had enough time to incorporate them into the unified data collection system. This was the second year that the state provided discipline data, and this year, there was wider participation than in 1998-99. The collection has not had enough time to establish itself; therefore, significant changes\nare expected.\nOhioThe state indicated that increases from the previous year in the number of children subject to unilateral removal for drug and weapon offenses might be a result of a major emphasis by the state on safe and drug-free schools. Student codes of conduct and state law leave little discretion regarding the consequences for certain\ntypes of behavior.\nOklahomaThe state reported that the changes in the discipline data from the\nprevious year are the result of more accurate reporting in 1999-2000.\nPennsylvaniaThe state noted that collecting the discipline data has been\nproblematic. The data are hard to collect at the district level because of the state's collection methodology. In addition, there are conflicting definitions used at the state and district levels. The state will address the problem with more data collection training at the state and local levels.\nTennesseeThe state attributed the variations in the discipline data from 1998-99 to 1999-2000 to a change in its data collection methodology. The 1998-99 data were collected by way of a separate survey. This year's data are collected as part of the special education reporting system.\nWisconsinThe state was unable to report an unduplicated count of children\nsubject to unilateral removal for drug and weapon offenses.\nTable A111: Counts of Infants and Toddlers Served\nIllinoisThe state reported that the increase in the child count from 1999-2000 to 2000-01 is a continued result of massive Child Find efforts mandated by the state courts. Further, the state also began allowing children to remain eligible until age 3 regardless of their progress.\n\n74 6\n\nA-483\n\n\fTables A117: Early Intervention Service Settings\nColoradoThe state of Colorado attributes the increase in the number of children served in the home setting category to a change in focus to concentrate on getting children out of center-based programs and providing more services in natural environments. One of the larger counties in the state transformed its entire project from center based (programs for developmental delay) to focus on providing services in natural environments.\nConnecticutThe state reports that the decrease in the number of children served in the programs for typically developing children setting is a result of training staff on the definition of the category.\nIllinoisThe state reports that its increased child count resulted in more children served in all settings categories from 1998-99 to 1999-2000. This is More apparent for the home settings category as a result of an emphasis on providing services in\nnatural environments.\nIndianaThe state reports that the change in the number of children served in\ndifferent settings, in particular the 71% increase in the home setting, reflects the shift toward providing services in natural environments.\nNew YorkThe increase in the number of children served in the service provider location setting is primarily the result of guidance given to counties regarding how to code specific settings in the state's data collection program.\nPuerto RicoThe decrease in the service provider location category (59.3%) is the result of the late receipt of settings data for children served by the Department of Education. The data were not received from the Puerto Rico Department of Education until after the February 1, 2001, date of submission, for a total of 205 children. The state did not submit revised data for this count.\nTexasThe state reports that the increase in the number of children served in the other settings category is due to the incorrect classification of some children in 199899. In the first year after the family child care category was dropped from the Federal reporting requirements, programs may have reported children receiving care in the family child care setting as receiving services in home-based rather than the other settings category. The state is now correctly reporting these children.\n\nTable A1112: Early Intervention Program Exiting\nAlabamaThe state reports that the 75% decrease in the attempts to contact\nunsuccessful category is a result of the state's changing the way the exit data for this category are collected. In 1998-99, two of the state's exiting reasons were combined to construct the Federal attempts to contact unsuccessful exit category. For 1999-\n\nA-484\n\n747\n\n\f2000, these categories are no longer combined, and the state is now correctly\nreporting in this category.\nConnecticutThe state reports that the increase in the number of children exiting under the categories Part B eligibility not determined, withdrawal by parent, and attempts to contact unsuccessful, as well as the decreases in the number who exit to other programs and exit with no referral are a result of improving the state's data system. The state also began running reports showing each program where data were\nmissing. This also helped to improve data accuracy.\nGeorgiaThe state explains that the increase in the number of infants and toddlers exiting is the result of improvements to the data collection procedures. Georgia is now able to accurately report exit data. In the previous year (1998-99), the state of Georgia was unable to accurately report exit data and as a result underreported the number exiting.\nIllinoisThe large increase in the Part B eligibility exiting category was a result of the state's implementing a policy allowing children to remain eligible until age 3 regardless of progress. The increase in the total number of children exiting is related to increases in Child Find efforts and the corresponding increased child count.\nIndianaThe state reported that the increase in the total number of children exiting is due to increased enrollment. The state noted that some other changes\n(completion of IFSP, withdrawn by parent, attempts to contact unsuccessful) should be expected if the state is beginning to reach children whose need for services is less severe.\nOklahomaThe state attributes the increase in the number of children exiting under the Part B eligible category, and the decreases in the number of children\nexiting with no referral and with Part B eligibility not determined, to its creation of a new database and training emphasis on the accurate reporting of data.\nTexasThe state reports that the increases in the categories exit with no referral and deceased are correct. Though the increase in the number deceased seems large (125 in 1998-99 and 166 in 1999-2000), in 1997-98 there were 143 deceased, suggesting some variation across years. In addition to the year-to-year variation, the state also believes that some of the reported increase in deaths is due to an increased\nnumber of medically fragile infants entering into services as a result of efforts on the part of programs to link with neonatal intensive care units.\nThe state explains the decline in the number of children withdrawn by parent as the result of changes in how the state classifies children who moved within the state. In 1998-99, children who exited for this reason were included in the withdrawal by parent category. In 1999-2000, these children were removed from the exit number, since they were not really exiting Part C services.\n\n7 4 8\n\nA-485\n\n\fWisconsinThe state reports that the increase in the number of children exiting under the Part B eligible category reflects better reporting as well 'as significant\nincreases in the number of children served in the 1999-2000 child count. Wisconsin's data require local programs to update the information on the children when they\nexit. With prodding from state staff, the local programs are more consistently\nreporting the changes.\nIn addition, the state also indicated that in 1999-2000 its reporting system did not include all the exit reasons used in the Federal report. The system has since been updated to include all of the Federal exit reasons.\n\nTable A1110: Early Intervention Services\nAlabamaThe state reports that the 1998-99 count of other services incorrectly\nincluded service coordination. To correct this, a statement was placed on the bottom of the form explaining which services were included in \"other.\" As a result, in 1999-\n2000, service coordination was no longer included in the \"other\" count. This\nresulted in the extreme difference in the numbers across the years.\nIllinoisThe state reports that the increase in the number of services provided is the direct result of the increased child count.\nIndianaThe state reports that the increases in speech;z1anguage pathology and audiology services are due to continuing outreach efforts and implementation of universal newborn hearing screening. The majority of the increase in assistive technology was for speech and hearing-related equipment. The decrease in transportation services is the result of a change in the location of services to the\nchild's home.\nNew MexicoThe state reports that the increase in the other early intervention\nservice category is consistent with the increase in the number of children served and with providers becoming more proficient with data entry into the FIT database.\nPuerto RicoThe state reported increases in several service categories and offers\nthe following as explanations:\n1. The increase in special instruction is a result of the state's changing how it classifies instructions to families. Instructions to families were being provided; however, they were counted under family training. The state has changed the classification and now counts instructions to families under the special instruction service category.\n2. The state explains that the increase in the number of audiology services is a result of the state's failing to include audiology-related services, such as fitting/adjustments of earphones, in previous counts.\n\nA-486\n\n7 4 9\n\n\fWisconsinThe state suggests that the decrease in the transportation service\ncategory is the result of more children receiving services in the home.\nTable A114: Early Intervention Personnel Employed\nIllinoisThe state reports that in 1998-99, special educators were incorrectly reported under the orientation/mobility personnel category. In the same year, the service coordinators were counted as other professional staff. These errors were\ncorrected for the 1999-2000 reporting year.\n\n75n\n\nA-487\n\n\fEducation Publications Center U.S. Department of Education P. 0.
