It is unclear how global perturbations in metabolism are related to severity of AD pathology and the eventual expression of AD symptoms in at-risk individuals. Understanding the metabolic basis of AD and its impact on disease progression during the early, preclinical, and prodromal stages is likely to provide insights into novel disease-modifying treatments for this irreversible, progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Metabolomics, which measures the biochemical products of cell processes downstream of genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic systems, has generated excitement because of its potential to capture snapshots of the complex and multifactorial biochemical pathways that may be altered in AD [1, 2] . These include changes across multiple physiological pathways driven by the complex interactions between behavioral, genetic, and environmental risk factors. Recent studies have applied metabolomics to examine alterations in blood metabolite profiles in AD; such studies have the potential to both discover peripheral biomarkers as well as identify key metabolic pathways intrinsic to AD pathogenesis [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . However, one of the key challenges in these metabolomics studies is the inability to link alterations in metabolite signals in the blood to those in the brain. It is therefore difficult to assess whether a peripheral signal associated with disease status is also reflected in the brain, where accumulation of distinct pathological features in specific regions is believed to trigger symptom onset. As is common with late-onset and gradually progressive diseases, there are many alterations in cell processes due to chronic comorbid medical conditions that may be reflected in peripheral blood metabolite concentrations. Additionally, traditional blood biomarker studies have relied mainly on the binary discrimination of established AD/mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from control (CN) samples. This study design ignores the long preclinical prodrome of AD, when brain pathology is accumulating but has not yet triggered the onset of cognitive impairment and functional decline in individuals eventually diagnosed with AD. As we have proposed previously [8] , alternative study designs in biomarker analyses, in which the primary end points are well-established endophenotypes of AD pathology rather than binary discrimination of case versus control, offer the potential to identify biologically relevant blood biomarkers for AD.\nHere, we describe a four-step approach to the discovery of brain and blood metabolites associated with pathology and progression of AD (Fig 1). (1) Identifying a brain metabolite signature of AD: in this phase of the study, we first used quantitative and targeted metabolomics to identify a panel of metabolites that accurately differentiated brain tissue samples from neuropathologically confirmed AD and CN subjects. (2) Testing blood metabolite associations with AD endophenotypes: we then tested whether serum concentrations of the same metabolites in two independent samples representing preclinical AD and prodromal AD were associated with distinct clinical, cognitive, neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) endophenotypes of AD. (3) Summarizing results: we developed an integrated blood and brain endophenotype score (Endophenotype Association Score in Early Alzheimer's Disease [EASE-AD]) summarizing the relative importance of specific brain and blood metabolites to severity of AD pathology and disease progression. (4) Mapping biological pathways: we finally mapped the main metabolite classes emerging from these analyses to key biological pathways implicated in AD pathogenesis to understand the potential roles of these molecules and their interactions in triggering symptom onset and progression of AD."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) is a prospective cohort study of community-dwelling participants that began in 1958 [9, 10] . Detailed clinical and cognitive evaluations, including neurological, laboratory, and radiological evaluations, were conducted every 2 years. Since 2003, participants older than 80 years received yearly assessments. The autopsy subsample used in Step 1 (i.e., Identifying a brain metabolite signature) to generate the brain metabolite signature of AD included 44 participants (N = 15 AD; N = 14 CN; N = 15 asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease [ASYMAD], described below). For Step 2 (i.e., Testing blood metabolite associations with AD endophenotypes), metabolomic analyses in serum samples were performed on 207 BLSA (exclusion criteria described below) participants divided into \"converters\" and \"non-converters.\" Converters were defined as participants who were cognitively normal at the initial blood draw and developed incident AD based on consensus clinical diagnosis (described below) during follow-up approximately 5 years later. These participants were age and sex matched to non-converters and defined as participants who remained cognitively normal over a similar follow-up interval. Initial serum samples were collected while both groups were cognitively normal; we therefore characterize the converters in this sample as representing \"preclinical AD.\" Demographic characteristics of the autopsy sample and blood study sample in the BLSA are included in Table 1 . Written informed consent was obtained at each visit; the BLSA study protocol has ongoing approval with the institutional review board of the National Institute of Environmental Health Science (NIEHS), National Institutes of Health.\nAs described below, in addition to identifying a brain metabolite signature of AD in Step 1, the BLSA sample was used in Step 2 to test associations between blood metabolite concentrations and the following AD endophenotypes: (1) differences by diagnoses (i.e., converters versus non-converters), (2) risk of conversion to incident AD, and (3) trajectories of cognitive performance prior to onset of AD symptoms.\nThe Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) sample was also used in Step 2 (i.e., Testing blood metabolite associations with AD endophenotypes). ADNI is an ongoing, longitudinal study launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by principal investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessments can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD. Details on study design, participant recruitment, study approval, and informed consent procedures have been published previously [11] . The study was approved by the institutional review boards of all of the participating institutions/study sites. The full list of participating institutions is included in S1 Table. Informed written consent was obtained from all participants at each site. Metabolomics data for ADNI samples were generated by the Alzheimer Disease Metabolomics Consortium and (ADMC) deposited to LONI. The mission of the ADMC is to create a comprehensive metabolomics database for AD. ADNI data used in the preparation of this article were also obtained Step 1, we used a quantitative and targeted metabolomics approach followed by two machine-learning methods to identify a panel of metabolites-a \"brain metabolite signature of AD\"-that accurately differentiated brain tissue samples from neuropathologically confirmed AD and CN subjects. In Step 2, using that same metabolite panel, we explored whether blood concentrations of metabolites in two independent samples representing prodromal AD (ADNI) and preclinical AD (BLSA) were associated with distinct clinical, cognitive, neuroimaging, and CSF endophenotypes of AD. In Step 3, we summarized results by developing an integrated blood and brain endophenotype score capturing the relative importance of specific brain and blood metabolites to severity of AD pathology and disease progression. In Step 4, we mapped the main metabolite classes (emerging from Step 3) to key biological pathways implicated in AD pathogenesis.

This commercially available platform allows for the quantification of amino acids, acylcarnitines, sphingomyelins (SMs), phosphatidylcholines (PCs), hexoses (h1s), and biogenic amines. Details on the assays have been published previously [24] . Briefly, the validated assay uses two different mass spectrometric methods with isotope labeled and other internal standards for absolute quantification of metabolites. The acylcarnitines, lipids, and h1s are analyzed by flow injection analysis-tandem mass spectrometry (FIA-MS/MS). The amino acids and biogenic amines are derivatized using phenylisothiocyanate and analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) using an AB SCIEX 4000 QTrap mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX, Darmstadt, Germany) with electrospray ionization. Concentration of each metabolite was measured in \u03bcM.\nFor brain tissue metabolomics, regions were selected a priori in the middle frontal gyrus (MFG), inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), and cerebellum (CBL). The MFG and ITG were sampled to represent brain regions vulnerable to amyloid \u03b2 and tau deposition, respectively; the CBL was sampled to represent a brain region resistant to classical AD pathology. A sterile 4-mm-diameter tissue punch was extracted from the cortical surface of the brain tissue regions, which were stored at \u221280\u02daC. To extract metabolites, samples were homogenized using Precellys with ethanol phosphate buffer; samples were then centrifuged, and the supernatant was used for analysis. Metabolite concentrations in brain tissue samples indicated as less than the limit of detection (LOD) were imputed as the highest value below the LOD. This method removed all differences below the LOD but still allowed machine-learning classifiers to pick up any differences in metabolite concentrations between those above the LOD and those below.\nFor blood metabolomics, in BLSA, converter and non-converter samples were randomly divided into 6 batches. Each batch was processed in separate runs with technicians blinded to diagnostic status. Additional data processing and checking steps, including reproducibility and testing for equality of coefficient of variance across metabolites, has been described in detail previously [25] . BLSA serum samples indicated as less than LOD were not imputed due to minimal missingness; 25/26 metabolites had 0 < LOD values. ADNI data processing has been described in detail previously and included imputing values indicated as less than the LOD as the metabolite LOD/2, as determined by the ADMC [25] .

There were no subsequent data-driven alterations to this conceptual analytic plan; final data visualization for Step 3, Summarizing results, was based on various iterations during analyses. The inclusion of ADNI data occurred in fall 2016 after our data request was approved by the ADMC.\nStep 4, Mapping biological pathways, occurred after we identified the principal classes of metabolites emerging from Steps 1-3. Sensitivity analyses testing blood metabolite associations with AD endophenotypes in BLSA (indicated below in Step 2) were conducted at the request of reviewers.\nStep 1: Identifying a brain metabolite signature of AD. Absolute brain tissue concentrations of 187 targeted metabolites were generated using the quantitative metabolomic methods described previously on the MFG, ITG, and CBL in the autopsy subsample of the BLSA. We used two machine-learning methods, support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), to generate average values of classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for discriminating between postmortem AD and CN samples in each of the three brain regions examined. Both machine-learning methods are based on different principles (described below) and were used in combination to avoid bias towards a particular methodology when selecting relevant metabolites. The prediction models use the selected metabolites in combination with each other, effectively modeling interactions between them. The primary aim of the machine-learning analyses was to discriminate between AD and CN samples, and therefore the ASYMAD group was not included in defining the brain metabolite signature of AD.\nBriefly, SVM is a classification method that attempts to find a separating surface between two classes with maximum margin [29] . If there is no separating surface in the original feature space, SVM uses a kernel to implicitly map the features into a higher dimensional space, in which a separating surface can be found. The performance of an SVM classifier on test data has rigorous theoretical bounds [29] , and it is possible to limit the \"complexity\" of the prediction model to match the amount of data available. It has been shown that complex classifier models that have many parameters that can be tuned to match the training data perform poorly on test data due to overfitting. The restriction on the complexity of the SVM classifier has been found to generalize well to test data, particularly when the number of features (p) is much greater than the number of samples (n) [30] .\nSince its inception in 2001, RF has become popular in the machine-learning and bioinformatics communities [31] . RF is one of the so-called ensemble methods for classification, because a set of classifiers (instead of one) is generated and each one casts a vote for the predicted label of a given instance provided to the model. Each classifier is a tree built using the classification and regression trees (CART) methodology [32] . RF often requires little tuning of the parameters. RF is nonlinear, multivariate, and can deal with high-dimensional data, even in small sample size situations. RF contains built-in metrics of variable importance, which allow evaluating the relative relevance of each variable in a RF model. In the present report, we used the permutation index of variable importance, which quantifies decreases in accuracy of the estimated RF model due to random permutation of a given variable. Additional details on using SVM and RF methodologies to discriminate between diseased and non-diseased individuals in AD have been published previously [33] . To estimate metrics of performance (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity) we used leave-one-out (LOO) cross validation.\nThe SVM and RF methods generated a ranked list of the top metabolites that contributed to discriminating between AD and CN samples. The ranking for SVM was based on the number of cross-validation iterations that each metabolite was selected in (i.e., higher numbers indicating higher rank), while that for RF was based on the mean decrease in accuracy when a particular metabolite was excluded from the prediction model. Because both methods rely on different analytic principles and differences in feature selection, we expected that the top metabolites from each method would not necessarily be identical; using both in combination therefore avoided bias when defining the brain metabolite signature.\nThe ITG samples had the highest accuracy and sensitivity/specificity in discriminating AD from CN samples. The top 20 ranked metabolites from each machine-learning classifier (SVM and RF) in this region (ITG) were therefore used to define the brain metabolite signature of AD.\nStep 1: Identifying a brain metabolite signature of AD: Differences by group and associations with AD pathology. We next explored differences in concentration of each brain tissue metabolite across 3 groups-AD, CN, and ASYMAD-in the ITG. Importantly, these analyses included the ASYMAD group, which was not utilized in the development of the brain metabolite signature of AD through the machine-learning analyses. Concentrations of brain tissue metabolites were natural log transformed. Proportional odds ordinal logistic models, a generalization of the Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis test, were used to test for differences across groups (i.e., AD, ASYMAD, CN) using brain tissue metabolite concentration as the outcome, group as the nominal predictor, and age at death and sex as covariates. We then explored associations between brain tissue metabolite concentrations and severity of AD pathology, specifically CERAD and Braak scores, again using all three groups, including ASYMAD. Spearman's rank correlation tests, adjusting for age at death and sex, were used to test these associations.\nStep 2: Testing blood metabolite associations with AD endophenotypes: Risk of conversion to incident AD in cognitively normal older adults (BLSA). In the BLSA sample, we explored whether the natural log-transformed blood concentration of each metabolite identified in the brain metabolite signature of AD was associated with risk of conversion to incident AD. We used Cox regression models, a class of survival models, to explore whether the initial concentration of each metabolite (i.e., while all participants were cognitively normal) was associated with the time to onset of conversion to AD. We included the covariates, age at initial blood draw and sex, in the model; individuals who remained normal (non-converters) at follow-up were censored at their last visit. Hazard ratios (HRs) indicate the relative increase in the hazard rate associated with 1 log-unit increase in concentration of the log-transformed metabolite. An HR greater than 1.0 indicates that higher log-transformed concentration of the metabolite is associated with increased risk, while an HR less than 1.0 indicates that lower concentration of the log-transformed metabolite is associated with increased risk.\nStep 2: Testing blood metabolite associations with AD endophenotypes: Associations with cognitive performance (BLSA). Using the metabolites identified in the brain metabolite signature of AD, we next explored whether the natural log-transformed blood concentration of each metabolite was associated with longitudinal trajectories of cognitive performance in cognitively normal individuals who developed incident AD. We first generated domain-specific composite scores within the following domains: memory, attention, executive function, language, and visuospatial ability using methods described previously [24] . These methods are also described in detail in S1 Appendix. Briefly, composite scores were calculated by summing and averaging the standardized scores from multiple tests within each cognitive domain. Linear mixed effects regression models were used to test whether the concentration of each metabolite was associated with longitudinal changes in domain-specific cognitive performance in cognitively normal individuals converting to incident AD. All models included the following predictors: natural log-transformed metabolite concentration, age at initial blood draw, sex, time (in days between follow-up visit and baseline; baseline indicated as time = 0), and the two-way interaction of each predictor with time. The main predictor of interest was the interaction of metabolite concentration with time, which indicates an increase or decrease in the annualized rate of change in domain-specific cognitive performance associated with an increase in metabolite concentration. As our main goal in these analyses was to examine associations between blood metabolite concentrations and progression of AD during the early preclinical stage of disease, we excluded all cognitive performance data after the onset of AD symptoms.\nStep 2: Testing blood metabolite associations with AD endophenotypes in BLSA (sensitivity analyses). Due to differences in serum sample storage time among converters and non-converters in the BLSA cohort and a greater number of converter samples excluded by the Met-So cutoff, we performed additional sensitivity analyses within a subsample of converters and non-converters. After excluding all samples with Met-So concentration >5 \u03bcM, we matched converter to non-converter serum samples on the duration of sample storage at \u221280\u02daC within a range of \u00b12 years. This produced a matched sample of 74 converters (storage time: 16.15 [SD: 5.83]) and 74 non-converters (storage time: 15.89 [SD: 5.90]). In these sensitivity analyses, we tested whether significant associations observed in the original dataset between serum metabolites and (i) risk of conversion to incident AD and (ii) cognitive performance remained significant after matching on storage time.\nStep 2: Testing blood metabolite associations with AD endophenotypes: Associations with AD-like brain atrophy patterns and CSF biomarkers of AD pathology (ADNI). Using the metabolites identified in the brain metabolite signature of AD, we next explored cross-sectional associations between natural log-transformed blood metabolite concentrations and the SPARE-AD index, a measure of AD-related brain atrophy derived from MRI scans [27] . We used multivariate linear regression, including the following predictors: natural logtransformed baseline metabolite concentration, baseline age, and sex; the outcome was the SPARE-AD index (higher scores represent more \"AD-like\" brain atrophy patterns).\nIn the ADNI sample, we additionally examined cross-sectional associations between natural log-transformed baseline blood metabolite concentrations and natural log-transformed CSF t-tau, p-tau, and A\u03b2 concentrations. Similar to the model for the SPARE-AD analysis, multivariate linear regression models included the following predictors: natural log-transformed baseline metabolite concentration, baseline age, and sex; the outcomes were natural log-transformed CSF t-tau, p-tau, and A\u03b2 1-42 concentrations.\nStep 2: Testing blood metabolite associations with AD endophenotypes: Associations with risk of conversion to incident AD (ADNI). In the ADNI sample, we explored whether the natural log-transformed blood concentration of each metabolite identified in the brain metabolite signature of AD was associated with risk of conversion from MCI to incident AD. Similar to survival models used in BLSA, Cox regression models were used to explore whether initial metabolite concentrations in MCI participants were associated with the time to onset of conversion to AD. We included covariates, age at baseline blood draw, and sex in the model; individuals who remained MCI at follow-up were censored at their last visit. Similar to survival models used in BLSA, the HR indicates the relative increase in the hazard rate associated with 1 log-unit increase in concentration of the log-transformed metabolite. An HR greater than 1.0 indicates that a higher log-transformed concentration of the metabolite is associated with increased risk, while an HR less than 1.0 indicates that a lower concentration of the log-transformed metabolite is associated with increased risk.\nStep 3: Summarizing results: Calculating the EASE-AD score. In order to visually summarize results from all analyses of metabolites comprising the brain metabolite signature of AD and to explore whether metabolites clustered by class in their associations with distinct AD-related endophenotypes, we generated a heat map indicating statistically significant associations between AD metabolites (y-axis) and the specific brain and blood endophenotypes (xaxis) described above. Significant associations (p < 0.05) are highlighted in red or green indicating that increased or decreased metabolite concentration, respectively, is associated with the various AD-related endophenotypes. Nonsignificant associations are indicated in gray. The 26-metabolite panel (brain metabolite signature of AD) was determined specifically based on metabolite rankings from the machine-learning classifiers following rigorous cross validation and thus represent a priori hypotheses in subsequent analyses. Additionally, these secondary, exploratory analyses were all focused on testing the associations of these metabolites with distinct measures of AD progression in order to identify consistent trends across two independent cohorts [34] . For these reasons, we elected not to use a p-value correction in the secondary analyses.\nIn order to enhance ease of interpretation of the summary heat map, we collapsed all longitudinal domain-specific cognitive performance tests into one category indicating significant longitudinal associations in any domain. We included the following brain endophenotype categories: (1) Differences in brain metabolite concentrations in the ITG by diagnosis (i.e., AD, CN, and ASYMAD) and correlations of metabolite concentrations in the ITG with (2) CERAD and (3) Braak scores. We included the following blood metabolite versus preclinical AD endophenotype categories (BLSA): associations of blood metabolite concentrations with (4) risk of progression from normal to incident AD and (5) longitudinal trajectories of cognitive performance. We included the following blood metabolite versus prodromal AD endophenotype categories (ADNI): associations of blood metabolite concentrations with (6) AD-like brain atrophy patterns on MRI (i.e., SPARE-AD score), (7) CSF A\u03b2 1-42 , (8) CSF t-tau, (9) CSF p-tau, and (10) risk of progression from MCI to incident AD. We then calculated a summary EASE-AD score indicating the number of significant associations for each AD metabolite with brain and blood endophenotypes (max score: 10). This score is included as the last column in the heat map; visualized metabolites are sorted based on this score in order to explore clustering of metabolite species within main classes.\nWe present detailed results for representative metabolites that showed significant associations with multiple AD phenotypes. Detailed results for all 26 AD metabolites are included in Supporting information tables (S3 Table-S11 Table) .\nStep 4: Mapping biological pathways. In order to interpret our results within the biological context of the metabolic pathways implicated, we mapped the principal metabolite classes emerging from our analyses to their known primary biosynthetic and catabolic pathways as well as their known interactions through various enzymatically regulated intermediary reactions (\"Metabolic pathway\"). We also mapped the main metabolite classes implicated to key signaling mechanisms related to AD pathogenesis (\"Signaling pathway\")."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants: Demographic characteristics", "text": "The demographic characteristics of BLSA participants in the autopsy cohort whose brain tissue samples were used in the metabolomics assays are included in Table 1 .

Furthermore, we were able to identify these specific metabolites through a data-driven process that first used machine-learning methods to generate an AD-specific brain metabolite signature, and then clustered these metabolites based on the EASE-AD summary score representing cumulative associations of each metabolite, with outcome measures related to AD pathology and progression."}, {"section_title": "Sphingolipids and AD", "text": "This process identified sphingolipids as a class of metabolites that are consistently associated with preclinical and prodromal AD, as well as with AD pathology at autopsy. Additionally, for all sphingolipid species-across all endophenotypes in brain, prodromal, and preclinical blood samples-increased concentration was associated with a more \"AD-like\" phenotype. Our results add substantially to a growing body of literature suggesting that perturbations in sphingolipid metabolism are related to key aspects of AD pathogenesis [43, 44] . SMs are a subclass of sphingolipids that are enriched in the central nervous system as important constituents of lipid rafts [38] and play a critical role in neuronal cell signaling [45, 46] . In the brain, sphingolipids mediate a diverse array of biological functions that are relevant to critical molecular mechanisms in AD, including amyloidogeneic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) within SM-rich lipid rafts [47] and regulation of hippocampal neuronal excitability [48] . While previous studies in postmortem human brain tissue have demonstrated altered levels of total SM content in AD relative to CN [49, 50] , few have quantified absolute concentrations of distinct SM species within brain regions differentially vulnerable to AD pathology. Metabolic pathways and signaling cascades involving glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids: relevance to AD pathogenesis. Schematic articulation of the core metabolic and signaling pathways in neurons, highlighting links between glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid classes of lipid species identified in the current study to be associated with the severity of AD pathology in the brain. Nutrient transporters (SLC5A7, SLC1A5, CD36, FATPs) present both at the BBB as well as the neuronal cell membrane mediate the uptake of amino acids, long chain fatty acids, and vitamin precursors into neurons necessary for the de novo synthesis of glycerophospholipid and SM lipid species [35, 36] . The \"metabolic pathway\" section of the diagram represents the core metabolic pathways involved in the synthesis and recycling of glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid species. The \"signaling pathway\" section connects these lipid species to the core representative signaling cascades implicated in mediating multiple aspects of AD pathology in the brain, such as formation of neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and AD-like brain atrophy. In a condition-dependent manner, incoming free fatty acids are incorporated into glycerolipids or ceramides in the endoplasmic reticulum. Similarly, LCFAs are processed in peroxisomal organelles to generate ether lipids. Coupling with the Kennedy pathway, glycerolipids and Our findings are broadly consistent with those of Chan and colleagues, who demonstrated higher levels of the SM species SM d18:1/22:1 and d18:1/26:1 in the prefrontal and entorhinal cortices of AD patients, relative to CN [51] .\nMost previous studies reporting on altered blood sphingolipid levels in AD have used an untargeted lipidomics approach (e.g., [52, 53] ). Some recent studies have used the p180 targeted metabolomics platform to assay absolute concentrations of metabolites associated with AD. An important distinction in the design of these previous studies and our current report is in our use of a brain-derived AD metabolite signature to guide focused analyses of these metabolites in blood as well as a comprehensive exploration of their associations within both preclinical and prodromal AD samples. Two studies [25, 54] have recently reported on p180 metabolite data within blood samples in the ADNI and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohorts. While there is minimal overlap between these results and our current report, it is striking to note that two sphingolipids we observe to be increased in the temporal cortex of AD patients and identified in our brain metabolite signature of AD (SM C16:0 and SM [OH] C14:1) were associated with brain atrophy, cognitive decline, and risk of conversion from MCI to AD in ADNI [25] . Similarly, blood concentrations of SM C16:0 and SM C26:1 were also associated with a diagnosis of MCI and dementia, respectively, in the predominantly African-American ARIC cohort [54] .\nOur findings that blood concentration of sphingolipids represented in the brain metabolite signature of AD are also associated with progression during preclinical and prodromal AD suggest that these are biologically relevant, early signals of disease progression. Equally importantly, correcting perturbations in sphingolipid metabolism may represent a plausible novel strategy for therapeutic intervention in AD. In this context, the emerging roles of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P)-metabolizing enzymes and S1P analogs in ameliorating A\u03b2-induced neuroinflammation in AD [55, 56] are especially promising."}, {"section_title": "Glycerophospholipids and AD", "text": "The second major class of metabolites we observed to be related to measures of AD pathology were glycerophospholipids (i.e., PCs and lysophosphatidylcholines [LysoPCs] ). The majority of associations between these metabolites were in the brain tissue samples: generally, lower concentrations of glycerophospholipids were associated with greater severity of both amyloid and neurofibrillary pathology; associations between glycerophospholipids and preclinical and prodromal AD endophenotypes were sparse. In previous studies using untargeted and semiquantitative metabolomics, we demonstrated that AD patients show lower plasma ether lipids are converted to either aa or ae PC species [37] . PCs are metabolized by the phospholipase or SML enzymes to recycle back phosphatidic acid or DAG or to generate SM, respectively. These lipid species are critical in the formation of lipid rafts, which represent essential structural and functional domains for maintaining neuronal function [38] . In AD, remodeling of lipid rafts, especially with enhanced activity of SMLs, results in an increased ceramide to SM ratio, which facilitates A\u03b2 production by posttranslational stabilization of BACE1 enzyme. This leads to further generation of oligomeric A\u03b2 due to a feed forward regulatory loop between A\u03b2 and the SML enzymes [39] . Similarly, PC with saturated and unsaturated long-chain fatty acyl groups positively influence activity of the \u01b3-secretase enzyme by modulating cell membrane thickness and the lipid microenvironment of the enzyme [40] . Meanwhile, generation of lysophosphatidylcholine from membrane PC by both cytosolic PLA2G4A in Land's cycle [41] as well as the secretory soluble PLA2G2A can lead to dysregulation of intracellular calcium signaling in a G-protein receptor (GPR132, G2A) coupled manner. Dysregulated Ca2+ signaling can result in enhanced activity of CAMKII, which, in coordination with the ceramide-PP2A-GSK3\u03b2 pathway, results in tau hyperphosphorylation, leading to the generation of PHF and enhanced neurofibrillary tangle formation [42] .

We recently extended these findings to show that reduced plasma concentration of these phosphatidylcholines is also related to lower levels of cognitive performance in non-demented older individuals and reflects resting state cerebral blood flow (rCBF), a marker of neuronal activity, in several brain regions related to higher order cognitive processing [58] . Taken together, these prior findings and our current results add further evidence for a role of altered phosphatidylcholine metabolism in AD pathogenesis."}, {"section_title": "Network biology: Metabolic pathway alterations in AD", "text": "In order to develop an integrated understanding of central-peripheral lipid metabolite fluxes as well as interactions between the major metabolite classes observed in this study, we applied a network biology approach. Fig 5 summarizes these networks, based on prior knowledge of transport mechanisms related to these metabolites and their precursors as well as their known biosynthetic pathways and catabolic fates. Long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) precursors for glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid biosynthesis are transported both across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and through plasma membranes within the brain through protein-mediated active transport by fatty acid transport proteins (FATPs), long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSLs), fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs), and the fatty acid transporter (FAT)/CD36 [35, 36] . In the context of neurodegenerative diseases in general and AD in particular, transport of the omega-3 (\u03c9-3) polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3), into the brain is especially important [59, 60] . In a recent untargeted lipidomic analysis in brain tissue samples from the BLSA, we showed that dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism is associated with severity of AD pathology [24] . Fig 5 also shows key enzymatically regulated steps in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholines through the Kennedy pathway [37] and their reversible conversion to LysoPCs through Land's cycle [41] . The transfer of phosphocholine headgroups to ceramides by the enzyme phosphatidylcholine transferase (sphingomyelin synthase [SGMS] ) is a key intermediary step in sphingolipid biosynthesis [43] and is a potentially critical link between glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism observed in our current report.\nBy performing our initial discovery analyses in brain tissue samples at autopsy and subsequent validation in preclinical (i.e., BLSA) and prodromal (i.e., ADNI) serum samples, we were able to ask whether metabolic changes associated with markers of AD neuropathology in established disease are similar to blood metabolite changes in early AD pathogenesis. Broadly, our results indicate that there are shared pathways between metabolite changes in brain and blood, with the prodromal serum samples (i.e., ADNI) sharing more metabolites with brain samples than the preclinical (i.e., BLSA) serum samples (see Fig 4) . A plausible explanation for these findings is that blood metabolite changes associated with later stages of AD progression prior to symptom onset are more similar to metabolic correlates of AD pathology in established disease. In independent analyses, we have also used the BLSA and ADNI serum samples as discovery datasets to ask whether principal metabolites associated with preclinical and prodromal AD-related endophenotypes in blood are also represented among the brain metabolites (i.e., in \"established disease\") reported in the current study. Among serum metabolites previously shown to be associated with AD progression in BLSA, we find that propionylcarnitine (C3) concentration in serum discriminates between converter and non-converter samples [7] , and its concentration in the ITG is related to the severity of neuritic plaque pathology in our current study (Fig 4) . Among serum metabolites previously shown to be associated with AD endophenotypes in ADNI, we find that SMC (OH) C14:1 and SM 16:0 concentrations in serum are associated with CSF A\u03b2, concentration, brain atrophy, cognitive decline, and risk of MCI progression [25] , and their concentrations in the ITG (i.e., our current report) are both related to the severity of neuritic plaque pathology and differ across the three groups studied (Fig 4) . Taken together, while these findings suggest that there are metabolic pathways common to both AD-related neuropathology and blood-related disease progression, there are also those that are specific to disease stage and tissue compartment. Establishing the relative importance of common and distinct metabolic pathways across tissue types and disease stages will require subsequent studies in larger datasets."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "Our study has limitations. First, the relatively small number of brain tissue samples in our primary analyses may have limited our power to detect significant associations with other metabolites assayed and precluded the use of a discovery and validation dataset. The small number reflects the challenges of assembling brain tissue samples from well-characterized, longitudinally followed participants who also undergo detailed neuropathological assessment at death; future studies in larger brain samples are needed to validate our findings. Second, while the Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ platform is a standardized platform for multiplexed quantitative analysis of 187 different metabolites, these metabolites represent only a small proportion of the brain and blood metabolomes. Future analyses will expand our study framework across additional classes of metabolites. Third, it must be noted that we based our primary analyses on metabolites associated with AD pathology in brain tissue samples. In future studies, it would be important to perform similar analyses in cognitively normal individuals using primary outcomes derived from neuroimaging/CSF-based measures of early AD pathology in prodromal/ preclinical AD. Fourth, testing of pre-analytical variables in the BLSA serum samples indicated a potential selection bias: converter samples were subject to longer storage time at \u221280\u02daC, compared to non-converter samples (approximately 17 years versus 13 years, respectively; Table 1 ). Additionally, the converter group compared to the non-converter group had more samples above the cutoff values for Met-So concentration used as an indicator of sample quality. Therefore, we performed sensitivity analyses within a subsample of converters and nonconverters matched on storage time. In these sensitivity analyses, we confirmed that 10 of the 12 metabolites associated with AD-related outcomes in the BLSA serum samples (Fig 4) remained significant. We therefore interpret these sensitivity analyses to suggest that our observed results on serum metabolite concentrations in BLSA are not driven primarily by group differences in sample storage time or quality. Finally, it is important to note that the BLSA is a predominantly Caucasian sample of highly educated and relatively healthy older individuals. Our findings therefore merit confirmation in other cohorts with higher prevalence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In summary, we have applied quantitative and targeted metabolomics to identify a panel of sphingolipids, the concentrations of which, in brain tissue, are associated with severity of AD neuropathology and, in blood, with measures of progression during preclinical and prodromal AD.
