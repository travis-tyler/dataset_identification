The mechanisms behind higher order tide-surge interactions were also identified for the first time. The D6 and D8 bands were recognized as the dominant frequencies in tide-surge interaction, sometimes creating a total storm surge that was more than double that of the low-frequency, linear surge. Enhancement of quadratic friction from storm-induced currents is the primary mechanism causing the D6 interaction. The D8 interaction scales with the D6 and resonates in a portion of the estuary, amplifying the total surge. Sea level rise from climate change is expected to enhance inland storm surges as higher sea levels bring the system closer to the resonant depth for the D8 tide.

Storms create wind fields that push water toward land and allow it to \"pile up\" in the shallow water near the shore. The low barometric pressures at the center of storms also allows the mean sea level to rise to compensate for the pressure differential (National Hurricane Center, n.d.). Many other factors affect the magnitude of storm surges including storm speed, angle of approach to the coast, water depth, shape of coast, wave intensity, and currents (National Hurricane Center, n.d.)."}, {"section_title": "LIST OF TABLES", "text": "Storm surges are often the greatest threat to life and property during coastal storms. Hurricane Katrina, one of the deadliest hurricanes in United States history, recorded the highest documented storm surge in America (28 ft. (8.5 m) above mean sea level), recorded in Mississippi in 2005 (Masters, n.d.). Hurricanes are the main threat for storm surges on the Southeast and Gulf Coasts of the U.S. but are not the only storms to create these conditions. In the Northeast, powerful extra-tropical cyclones (mid-latitude storms) generate most of the largest storm surges in the region (Catalano and Broccoli, 2018). This class of storms includes nor'easters which are known for their strong winds directed from the northeast to southwest when traveling just offshore. Some of the largest surge events in the and Grayson set a record storm tide (4.9 ft. (1.5 m)) in Boston Harbor (Moore and Belles, 2018). The prevalence of record-breaking surge and flooding events in the Northeast United States in the past few years outlines the importance of understanding storm surges in the region. In the winter of 2018 alone, two of the top three storm tide records in Boston were broken (Fritz, 2018). These storms are significant, damaging, and dangerous, and their effects could change in the future. To accurately forecast storm surges in the future, understanding storm surge dynamics at coastal and inland shorelines is critical."}, {"section_title": "Climate Change", "text": "Studies show that climate change has the potential to increase storminess and the height of storm surges (Lowe and Gregory, 2005) and change storm tracks (Shaw et al., 2016). This shows that \"where\" and \"why\" surges occur may change in the future, becoming worse in some areas relative to the present. Climate change will also increase tidal ranges in some regions of the world (Devlin et al., 2017), further increasing the risk for coastal flooding from surges and create more of a hazard to life and property. Considering roughly 123.3 million people, or 39 percent of the United States' population, lived in counties directly on the shoreline in 2010 (NOAA, 2018), this draws the need for accurate surge forecasting. For coastal communities to consider adapting to worsening storm surge and flooding, the surge behavior itself must be fully understood in their area, then applied to forecasting."}, {"section_title": "Current Storm Surge Modeling", "text": "Currently, storm surges in the United States are forecasted by the National Weather Service's Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model, and the similar Extratropical (ET) storm surge model (Glahn et al., 2009). Storm surge forecasting is based on storm characteristics like atmospheric pressure and wind, and ignores nonlinear terms from the tide, advection, and river discharge. Past research on storm surges in some tidally energetic regions show that the nonlinear components to surge, particularly tide-surge interaction, can play a significant role in total surge timing and magnitudes (e.g Prandle and Wolf, 1978;Wolf, 1981;Horsburgh and Wilson, 2007). Considering Maine has some of the largest tidal amplitudes in the United States (Ray, 2006), nonlinear effects on surge may need to be considered in forecasting."}, {"section_title": "Objectives", "text": "Climate change is increasing the threat of storm surges and coastal flooding in many regions of the world. In tidally energetic areas like Maine, nonlinear components to storm surge (created by tidal interactions) could have a significant influence on total surges. The broad objectives of this thesis are to investigate tide and surge dynamics in multiple estuaries of variable morphology on the coast of Maine, to explore the nonlinear components of surge in one estuary, and to evaluate the accuracy of current modeling efforts on total estuarine surges. Chapter 2 draws comparisons between storm surge behavior in different systems based on morphology. Chapter 3 investigates the contributions of nonlinear tidesurge interaction to overall surge levels. The significance of tide-surge interaction, as well as implications for modeling are discussed in Chapter 4. The next section gives a background on tidal theory, to introduce concepts and terminology that will be used throughout the remainder of the thesis."}, {"section_title": "Background on Tides", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Principal Tides", "text": "Based on some of the classical work of Sverdrup et al. (1942) and then Pond and Pickard (1983), tides can be considered a superposition of multiple tidal constituents, each with a specific frequency and amplitude. Two principal tides exist, which are directly forced by the earth-sun (principal solar) and earth-moon (principal lunar) systems and each have a period near 12 hours (semidiurnal). The forces that create these tides are both gravitational and centrifugal, and they simultaneously act on each system. The landmasses on Earth prevent the principal tides from being proportional world-wide and create complex patterns in the tides which can be represented by adding other harmonics to the principal tide. The additional harmonics have periods near 12 hours or 24 hours (diurnal). Many areas therefore experience a mixed tide, where both a semi-diurnal and diurnal harmonic are significant. Fig. 3 shows three common scenarios for tides on the coast. In Maine, the tides are mixed with the M2 harmonic (semi-diurnal) having the stronger influence (Ray, 2006). The forcing of the sun and moon on the tides is not a constant phenomenon. When the forces of the sun and moon work together, or come into phase, the tidal range maximizes and is called a \"spring\" tide. When the sun and moon forces are out of phase, the tidal range minimizes and is called a \"neap\" tide. Spring and neap tides also vary depending on the alignment of the sun, moon, and Earth, with maximum spring tides occurring when the sun and moon are on the same side of the Earth. The spring / neap cycle has a period of near 15 days, creating a fortnightly modification to the principal tides over that period. "}, {"section_title": "Overtides", "text": "Nonlinear tidal interactions can occur from shallow water, friction, and tidal constituents interacting with each other (Parker, 1991). These nonlinearities further modify the principal tide and create overtides. Overtides are tidal constituents higher in frequency than the principal tides, and when added to the principal tide, they distort the tidal signal. Overtides are generally present in estuaries (but not all) or on relatively shallow continental shelf areas. The overtides generated from the M2 tide can create both symmetric and asymmetric distortions to the tidal wave depending on the forcing mechanisms. The terms representative of each forcing mechanism are derived from the onedimensional momentum and continuity equations, respectively: and with being the surface elevation above sea level, u is the cross-sectional averaged velocity, b is the width of the basin, h is the depth-averaged width below sea level, t is time, x is the Cartesian coordinate going up estuary, g is the vertical component of the acceleration due to gravity, and cf is the friction coefficient. In the case of the M2 being distorted without mean flow, the mechanisms responsible are the classical shallow water terms: ( ) and , which both have an asymmetric effect and create an even-frequency harmonic, the M4. The frictional term | | generates the same asymmetric effect. The only symmetric distortion comes from quadratic friction, | | , which creates odd-frequency harmonics like M4 from the M2. This mechanism affects flood and ebb phases of the tide equally, as there is no variable in the term placing dependence on depth. When a mean flow (like river) is introduced, elevation and velocity become more asymmetric over the tidal cycle since the flow augments wave propagation velocity and frictional attenuation on one phase of the tide and diminishes each during the other phase. This generally increases the amplitude of the even, asymmetric harmonics (M4) and decrease the odd, symmetric harmonics (M6). All harmonics that are higher in frequency than the M6 are compound tides. These overtides are created by the interaction of two or more harmonics and are dependent on the amplitudes and frequencies of the two interacting constituents. The M8 harmonic, for example, is created from the M6 interacting with the M2, and so should be lesser in magnitude than each but scale with them, although the results in chapter 3 will present cases when a compound tide can be larger.  (Glahn et al., 2009). Seven National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) buoys collect water level data off the coast of Maine, three of which are in estuaries. Most of the coastline in the state lacks data on tides and storm surges. Considering estuarine variables like bathymetry, shape, and freshwater discharge can affect tides (Friedrichs, 2010) and surges (Proudman, 1955 a,b) it becomes necessary to establish records of each in areas of Maine that previously had none, allowing state and local government to accurately plan on the coasts. The objectives of chapter 2 are to (1) characterize storm surge variability in estuaries of different morphology and (2) determine the the role of individual estuary characteristics on surge variability. The experiment itself is described in section 2.2, data processing and analysis in section 2.3, results in section 2.4, a discussion of results in section 2.5, and conclusions in section 2.6."}, {"section_title": "Data Collection and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Sites", "text": "Storm surge in three estuaries on the central coast of Maine was studied because of each system's notably different morphology (Fig. 4).

Bass Harbor features a salt marshes at the head of the estuary. Each estuary is described in more detail in the following sub-sections."}, {"section_title": "The Penobscot Bay and River", "text": "The Penobscot estuary extends approximately 100 km from the Atlantic Ocean near Rockland to the head at Bangor, with a width that varies from nearly 30 km in the lower bay to 0.24 km at Bangor. Maximum depths of the bay range from 120 m near the mouth to 30 m at the confluence with the river. Depths in the riverine portion of the system then decrease to 5.5 m near the head at Bangor. The primary sources of freshwater are the Penobscot River and Kenduskeag Stream at Bangor. The mean annual flow in Bangor is 396 m 3 /s and the 100-year peak flood is 3370 m 3 /s (Hodgkins, 1999). High runoff periods generally occur during the spring (April to May) with a mean monthly discharge of 1105 m 3 /s, while the lowest runoff period is typically September with a mean monthly discharge of 140 m 3 /s (Dudley, 2004). The climate of Maine is classified Dfb under the K\u04e7ppen climate classification system, meaning summers are warm and humid and winters are cold and very stormy (K\u04e7ppen, 1884). The riverine portion of the Penobscot often freezes in the winter because of cold temperatures."}, {"section_title": "The Bagaduce River", "text": "The Bagaduce River is a tidal river located in Hancock County, Maine that joins Penobscot Bay near the town of Castine. The Bagaduce originates at the confluence of Black Brook and the outflow of Walker Pond near the Brooksville and Sedgwick town line and runs about 20 km to Penobscot Bay. Widths fluctuate from mouth to head due to the existence of constrictions and tidal flats. At the mouth, the estuary is about 550 m wide, while the smallest constriction is located at a bridge between B3 and B4 ( Fig. 4[d]) and is roughly 15 m wide. The widest stretches near the bend in the \"L\" exceed 2 km. Depths range from about 25 m in the channel at the mouth to about 3 m in the channel near the head, with most loss of depth occurring between Castine and the first constriction. The Bagaduce is a relatively Harbor, creating relatively few shoal areas."}, {"section_title": "Citizen Science Network", "text": "The water level and barometric pressure data needed to calculate storm surge in each of these estuaries was collected by a network of volunteer citizen scientists and UMaine researchers. The locations where a citizen scientist or UMaine researcher collected data are shown in Fig. 4[c,d,e]. There were 22 monitoring stations total, with 8 located in the Penobscot, 5 in the Bagaduce, and 9 combined in Southwest and Bass Harbors. Data collection for this research began in the Fall of 2017 and ended in Spring 2018, capturing the stormy winter season, but some locations have continued collecting data since. The cumulative data set is intermittent due to numerous factors explained in the following sections. Table 1 shows the start and stop times for water level measurements at each location."}, {"section_title": "Data Collection", "text": "Measurements of absolute pressure were collected at each location (Table 1) with a HOBO water level logger, and 3 locations (Bangor, B1, and Dysart's Marina) collected barometric pressure with either a HOBO MicroStation or permanent weather station. Sampling intervals ranged from 1 to 2 minutes. Control stations for water level measurements were set up at 15 of the 22 locations to compare data from citizen scientist with UMaine researcher collected data: 2 controls were in Southwest Harbor, 5 in Bass Harbor, 3 in the Bagaduce, and 5 in the Penobscot. Water level measurements from a USGS river gage (#01037050) in Bangor sampling at 6-minute intervals was also used to supplement these data. Wind data from the Castine weather station (B1), sampling at 1-minute intervals, and at the Bangor International Airport, sampling at 6-minute intervals, were also used in analyzing storm events. Multiple factors contributed to inconsistent absolute pressure measurements and created the gaps in data shown in Table 1. The most significant issue was the development of ice during the winter months over the sheltered areas in each estuary, particularly the shallow regions of the Bagaduce near the head, and north of Bucksport in the riverine portion of the Penobscot River. Both UMaine researchers and citizen scientists were affected by icing issues which contributed to some data gaps, and the longevity of ice formation often prolonged the gaps. Icing was a general problem and so is mentioned here. Specific problems contributing to citizen scientist collected data gaps and contamination is elaborated on in section 2.4.1. x\" denotes a full month of data, whereas a blank space means no data."}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Tides", "text": "Absolute pressure measurements were combined with the nearest barometric pressure measurements to determine total water levels. Times series of both absolute and barometric pressures first were trimmed to yield consistent start and stop times (shown in Table 1), then interpolated onto the finer time grid. Pressure was then converted to units of kilopascals (kPa). The water depth above each sensor was then calculated as: where AP is the absolute pressure, BP is the barometric pressure, g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s 2 ), \u03c1 is the mean density of seawater (assumed to be 1025 kg/m 3 ), and the units of depth are meters (m). The water depths were then demeaned by subtracting the average depth of the time series from each depth in the series. The tidal contribution to water levels was computed using the T_Tide Matlab toolbox (Pawlowicz et al., 2002). T_Tide should only be used on sets of water levels at least 2 weeks long, as a shorter data set does not resolve the fortnightly modulation to the tide. T_Tide also requires water level time series to be nearly continuous to produce realistic predicted tides. Small gaps in data (on the order of minutes to 10s of minutes) were filled by linear interpolation. Data gaps resulted from contaminated data or inconsistent data uploads, which is described in detail in section 2.4.1. Gaps from contaminated data occasionally were too large (on the order of hours) to accurately interpolate. In these cases, T_Tide produced suspicious tides and could not be used in creating a predicted tide. Water level sets that could not be reprocessed could still be used to qualitatively compare tidal ranges and distortion between locations, as explained in the results.\nIn the Penobscot River, spatial variability in the tides occurred from the mouth to the head. Neap tidal ranges amplified from 2 m at Rockport to 2.5 m at Bangor (Fig. 20 [b]) and is likely influenced by channel convergence (Friedrichs, 2010). Tidal amplification was more prominent during spring tides, when tidal ranges increased from 4 m at Rockport to 5 m at Bangor (Fig. 20 [c]). Tidal distortion was identified at Bangor and featured a shorter flood phase relative to a longer ebb (Fig. 20). The distortion was likely promoted by enhanced overtide amplitudes from mouth to head (Table 4). The D4, D6, and D8 bands amplified from Rockport to Bangor from 0.024 to 0.267 m, 0.074 to 0.351 m, and 0.006 to 0.03 m, respectively during October and November. Amplification of these species was likely a result of increased shallow water and frictional effects (Parker, 1991) in the shallower riverine portion of the estuary (Fig. 18 [b]).  During December thru January, the overtide bands still amplified in the river relative to bay, but the principal tide was dampened by ice cover (Table 4). The D4, D6, and D8 tides increased from Belfast to Bangor from 0.019 to 0.36 m, 0.104 to 0.3 m, and 0.008 to 0.02 m, respectively, and the D2 band decreased from 2.45 to 2.33 m. Estuarine tides can be seasonally modulated in midlatitude estuaries by the development of ice, which is known to dampen principal tides and currents (Georgas, 2012). Ice formed on the Penobscot River from the middle of December through the end of January, causing the attenuation of the D2 at Bangor. This subsequently caused the D6 and D8 species to be smaller in Bangor (by 0.05 and 0.01 m, respectively) during the iced period compared to October and November."}, {"section_title": "Storm Surges", "text": "Two storms occurred over the study period which created significant surges relative to the rest of the period and are the focus events for the storm surge results. Storm surge was calculated as total water level minus predicted tide (produced by T_Tide). This calculation means storm surge includes residual water levels from wind set-up, atmospheric pressure differentials, river discharge, and any nonlinear interactions with the tide. This chapter analyzes total storm surges whereas chapter 3 decomposes surge into different components. The contour maps of surge results in 2.4.3 were created on ArcMap using linear interpolation."}, {"section_title": "Data Reliability", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Approach", "text": "An assessment of the reliability of citizen scientist collected data used qualitative and quantitative techniques with a three criteria approach. Data was evaluated for completeness, accuracy, and non-contamination. A complete data set is considered one that starts and ends when expected and contains data within the duration, an accurate data set is accurate relative to a control set, and a noncontaminated set contains data that has not been tampered with. Completeness and contamination were evaluated qualitatively through intercomparison of collected data sets, with results in Table 2. Accuracy was measured quantitatively (where data was available) using a percent error calculation comparing citizen scientist collected data to controls: where \"error\" is the absolute value of the difference between control and citizen data, and \"actual\" is the control data. Percent error results are presented in Table 3."}, {"section_title": "Evaluation", "text": "It should be noted that some data sets from citizen scientists had data gaps from contaminated data that were possible to fill with linear interpolation and are not included in the numbers presented in Table 2. Two common types of contaminated data were low water exposure (LWE) of pressure sensors ( Fig. 5 [b]) and unrealistic \"spikes\" in data (DS) created from sensor noise ( Fig. 5 [a]). Movement of sensors (M) during collection, whether by humans or currents, also contributed to contamination. In general, data contamination and gaps are well distributed between the study areas with 2 data sets deemed unusable in the Penobscot, 4 in the Bagaduce, and 4 in Bass Harbor. Of all the study areas, citizen scientists in Bass Harbor collected the most data sets with 24, followed by the Bagaduce with 21, the Penobscot with 17, and Southwest Harbor with 8. This shows that Southwest Harbor had the smallest ratio of unusable data to total collected data at 0, followed by the Penobscot at 0.12, followed by Bass Harbor at 0.17, then the Bagaduce at 0.19.   The most common reasons for incompleteness in data was from ice cover (ICE), as explained in section 2.2.2.1, non-continuous sensor deployment (NC), missed or forgotten data uploads (MU), and lost sensors (LS). In some cases, citizen scientists were trained and provided equipment, but they never deployed their sensors (\"N/A\" in Table 2), so many data sets they were expected to collect never were. All citizen scientists were expected to collect monthly data sets from first deployment (Table 1) to last. The largest average ratio of usable data sets to expected is in the Bagaduce (0.67), followed by Southwest Harbor (0.56), the Penobscot (0.43), and Bass Harbor (0.39). In layman's terms, the usable to expected ratio outlines that citizen scientists in the Bagaduce collected good data for 67% of the study period whereas in Bass Harbor good data was collected for 39% of the study period. The percent error calculation used in measuring accuracy was applied to 5 locations: B4, Dysart's Marina, the Tremont School, the Tremont Dock, and Thurston's Lobster Pound. Table 3 shows that each of these locations provided relatively accurate citizen scientist collected data. The largest error was at Dyart's Marina (8.4%) and smallest at the Tremont Dock (1.4%), showing accuracy of collected data did not depend on the system, rather the individual collecting data. Considering all three criteria for reliability, a few conclusions can be made. While citizen data was deemed accurate when successfully collected (Table 3), there are multiple instances where the citizen could not be relied upon to provide a consistent, non-contaminated data stream. Lack of completeness and contamination were therefore the main issues contributing to unreliable data, outlined in Table 2. Poor location selection resulted in things like persistent low water exposure of sensors and ice cover which both limited or contaminated data sets. There were also multiple citizen scientists who never deployed their sensors. Both location selection and data discontinuities can be directly linked to levels of engagement of researchers with citizen scientists. Improving the education of volunteers on proper locations for sensors, and staying in touch to remind of data uploads, both could improve the number of data sets collected and the quality of those data."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "\nTo understand how tide-surge interaction contributes to overall flood levels, the tidal characteristics in Penobscot Bay and River are evaluated in non-storm conditions.

These storms featured notably different in storm characteristics and produced varying storm surge patterns. The October storm, which will be referred to as the October Windstorm, was a hybrid storm created from the remnants of a tropical storm over the southeast states merging with a low-pressure system moving over the Great Lakes. This storm produced maximum sustained winds from the southeast near 20 m/s and a minimum barometric pressure of 982 mb recorded at Castine (B1). This storm was considered a \"bomb cyclone\", meaning the barometric pressure at the center dropped 24 mb or more in 24 hours, indicating rapid intensification. The storm track is presented in Fig. 6 [a], showing how the center of the storm passed to the west of Maine from the New York City area into Canada. The January storm behaved as a classic Nor'easter, producing blizzard conditions on the coast of New England. This storm will be referred to as the January Blizzard, and produced maximum sustained winds of 16 m/s from the north and a minimum barometric pressure reading at Castine of 967 mb.

Convergence of the estuary likely caused this amplification, meaning the surge behaved as an externally generated long wave during this event. Further, the phase lag in peak surge from mouth to head during the October event (2.3 h) shows the progressive wave-like nature of the surge. The progressive propagation was created by the unique storm track of this system ( Fig. 6 [a]), which caused the strongest winds in the study region to blow in the same direction the storm was traveling: from south to north. In the Bagaduce River, storm surges initially increased from the mouth (0.97 m) through \"the narrows\" to B2 (1.10 m) from convergence, then decreased from B2 to B5 (0.30 m), with the largest decrease between B3 and B4 ( Fig. 8). Increased friction over the shallow water and tidal flats between B2 and B3 created the first drop in surge, while the Rt. 175 bridge constriction explains the more significant dampening of surge from B3 to B4 and B5. Storm surges in the Bagaduce for this storm peaked at the head 3.43 hours after the mouth. The difference in peak surge times from B1 to the remaining locations outlines that the surge propagated in as an externally generated wave, like that observed in the Penobscot. In Bass Harbor, storm surges peaked at Thurston's Lobster Pound at 0.82 m then minimized at the entrance to the salt marshes at 0.69 m (Fig. 9). Variability among the locations between the mouth and Rt. 102 constriction was small (<0.1 m), likely from the small area of the estuary. The constriction caused the larger dampening of surge at the Tremont School, similar to constriction effects in the Bagaduce. In Southwest Harbor, maximum storm surges were larger than those in Bass Harbor by roughly 0.15 m and decreased from the mouth location (Manset Dock) to head (Dysart's Marina) by 0.06 m (Fig. 9). In both Bass Harbor and Southwest Harbor, maximum storm surges occurred simultaneously, likely because of small morphological and bathymetric variation between the two relatively close systems. October Windstorm at each measurement location (black dots).\nThe October Windstorm featured LFS over 1.5 days in the Penobscot (day 29.6 to 31.1 in Fig. 23   [a 1,2]). The LFS behaved as an externally generated wave, evident by an amplification between peaks at Rockport (0.35 m) and Bangor (0.71 m) and phase lag of 2.1 hours between the two locations ( Fig. 23 [a   1,2]). The amplification can be attributed to convergent effects in the estuary, which enhance externally generated surges in a similar manner to the tides (Friedrichs, 2010). Asymmetry between the rise and fall of LSF was observed and the asymmetry was enhanced upstream. At Bangor, the duration of rising LFS levels was ~ 19.2 hrs compared to the period (~16.7 hrs) of falling LFS levels. At Rockland, the duration was more symmetric, rising for 16.6 hrs and falling for 14.9 hrs. At both locations' maximum values of LFS occurred just after high water at the beginning of ebb tide (Fig. 23 [b 1,2]). Tide-surge interaction occurred across D2, D4, D6, and D8 bands over the time LFS rose and fell, and the interaction increased upstream and with each higher order harmonic (Fig 23). The overall tide-surge interaction contributed to a total surge (1.94 m) that was almost three times larger than LFS at Bangor (Fig. 23 a[1]). The amplitude of the D2 component of I began increasing at the start of the LFS, peaked on the ebb tide following the peak LFS (0.25 m at day 30.5 in Fig. 23 b[1]), and is phase shifted by 0.2 hrs. The amplitude of the D4 interaction peaked at day 30.4 (0.38 m), nearly double that of the predicted D4 tide (0.17 m) ( Fig. 23 b[1]). Both the D6 and D8 I began amplifying around day 30.3 at slack water and lasted until days 31 and 31.3, respectively (Fig. 23 d[1 In Rockport, tide-surge interaction was evident but much less pronounced. Total surge levels were 0.8 m, which were more than double LFS alone( Fig. 23 b[1]). At this location, amplitudes of I in the D2, D4 ,D6 ,and D8 bands peak at 0.11 m, 0.17 m, 0.16 m, and 0.15 m, respectively during the storm ( "}, {"section_title": "January Blizzard", "text": "During the January Blizzard, maximum surges increased from Belfast (0.86 m) to Bangor (1.01 m) in the Penobscot River (Fig. 10), markedly less than that observed during the October Windstorm. The difference in amplification between the events is based on storm track and surge propagation. The January storm passed to the east of the region (Fig. 6 [b]), so winds blew in the opposite direction and against the direction the storm was moving. This created a surge more locally generated within the estuary, mainly from pressure, that did not propagate in. Further, the small phase lag (<45 min) in peak surge from Belfast to Bangor relative to the October event is indicative of a non-externally generated surge, as is the lesser amplification from mouth to head. Convergent affects only enhance surge when it propagates in from the mouth, whereas a locally generated surge would have a more uniform magnitude in the same estuary. Figure 10: Contour map of maximum storm surges (red) in Penobscot Bay and River for the January Blizzard at each measurement location (black dots). In the Bagaduce River, ice cover limited the data availability to stations B1 and B2. Between these two locations (the \"narrows\"), storm surges increased from 0.83 m at B1 to 1.26 m at B2 (Fig. 11) (Fig. 12). At all locations during the January Blizzard, storm surges peaked near the same time or had no clear direction of propagation, so times were not included on the contours during that storm. The variability in surges from Bass Harbor to Southwest Harbor between events is linked to surge propagation. The externally generated surge during October propagated from the south to north and so amplified as it passed through Western Way, the channel connecting the two harbors. During the January Blizzard, locally generated surge did not propagate landward and so the convergent effects of Western Way were not utilized. Pressure associated with the January storm was the main driver of this locally generated surge, which is reflected in the similar surges in both Bass Harbor and Southwest Harbor.  Tides were characterized by analyzing observed water levels during non-stormy periods. The Penobscot was the only estuary with enough data to compare tides during periods of ice to periods of no-ice ( Fig. 13 and 14). Spring and neap tidal ranges increased from the bay to head during non-ice conditions. Spring tidal ranges were enhanced by nearly 1 m, varying from 3.7 m at Belfast to 4.8 m at Bangor. During neap tides, tidal amplification was reduced, increasing 0.5 m upstream. The tidal ranges were also smaller during neap tides, indicated by 2.5 m tidal ranges at Belfast and 3 m at Bangor (Fig.   13). Tidal amplification in the Penobscot, like surge amplification, is a result of estuary convergence. During periods of ice, the tidal range in Bangor was lower relative to non-iced times due to tidal damping by ice, a common phenomenon in midlatitude estuaries (Georgas, 2012). Spring and neap tides amplified from ranges of 3.16 m and 2.67 m at Belfast, respectively, to 3.5 m and 2.86 m at Bucksport. The tide then attenuated by 0.2 m from Bucksport (3.50 m) to Bangor (3.30 m) during spring and by 1.5 m from Bucksport (2.86 m) to Bangor (1.30 m) during neap (Fig. 14). Typically ice cover forms between Bucksport and Bangor due to shallow bathymetry. Distortion to the tide is noted in the river locations of the Penobscot (Hampden and Bangor) due to overtide development in the shallower water. Flood tides were shorter in duration than the ebbs, meaning high waters occurred sooner in the river than bay, and low waters later in the river than bay (Fig. 13 and 14). Specific information on the overtides present in the Penobscot are discussed in chapter 3, but they can broadly be related to increased shallow water effects and friction moving into the shallower river section of the estuary (Parker, 1991).  occurred at nearly the same time (< 20 min. difference), while B3 was 45 min. after B1, and B4 and B5 experienced high tide roughly 3 hours after B1. The phase difference was different for low tide, as B2 occurred less than 30 min. after B1, while B3 was about 2 hours after B1, and B4 and B5 both nearly 5 hours after B1 (Fig. 15). Friction from tidal flats (Pethick, 1980) and the bridge constriction contribute to the phase delays observed.  around 9 hours after, with these phase delays also due to the constriction (Fig. 16).  \nTide-surge interaction also occurred during the January Blizzard, but was less defined than the October Windstorm due to locally generate surge. During the storm LFS rises, peaks and falls over approximately 1.3 days (day 35 to 36.3, Fig. 24 [a 1, 2]) with peak LFS occurring at Belfast (0.46 m) 45 minutes prior to Bangor (0.24 m) ( Fig. 24 [a 1, 2]). Overall, LFS was higher near the mouth of the estuary (Belfast) rather than upstream (Bangor), which indicated that LFS was generated locally in the estuary rather than externally. As the Penobscot River estuary is oriented in the North-South direction, this finding is reinforced by the southeasterly winds present during the blizzard (Fig. 5b and 6a). Further, the short-duration phase lag between LFS peaks in Bangor and Belfast indicates that the LFS did not behave as a progressive, externally generated wave. At both Belfast and Bangor peak LFS occurs during mid-ebb tide ( Fig. 24 [a 1,2], [b 1,2]). Although LFS values are larger near the estuary mouth, tide-surge interaction, I, is more pronounced upstream. Tide-surge interaction increased total surge in Bangor to 1 m, when added to LFS (day 35.6, 0.24 m, Fig. 24 [a 1]). At this location the contribution to I from D2 has a maximum amplitude of 0.08 m that occurred at mid-flood tide prior to peak LFS (day 35.4, Fig. 24 [b 1]). This contribution to I from D2 was weaker than during non-storm conditions (day 34.9 and 36.3, 0.15 and 0.22 m Fig. 24 [b 1]), indicating that during the storm energy from the D2 tide is put into higher harmonics. The D4 interaction amplitude was maximum during peak LFS (day 35.6, 0.25 m), but did not exceed the maximum D4 predicted tide (0.54 m, Fig. 24 [c 1]). The amplitude of the D6 interaction was comparable to its corresponding PT (0.25-0.4 m), and only exceeded PT at the maximum I, which occurs during peak LFS and ebb tide (day 35.6, Although peak LFS in in Belfast (0.46 m) was larger than Bangor (0.24 m), the total surge was approximately 27 cm less, indicating that tide-surge interaction was elevated upstream (Fig. 24 [a]). At Belfast, the contribution to I from both the D2 and D4 bands were similar during storm and non-storm conditions ( Fig. 24 [b  These results show that high-frequency harmonics (D4, D6, and D8) that contribute to tide-surge interaction can more than double total surge levels in the Penobscot River estuary. These highfrequency harmonics are tied to quadratic friction ( | | ) through both compound and non-compound harmonic interactions (Parker, 1991). Current velocities, and therefore quadratic friction, will now be examined and linked to tide-surge interaction observed during both storms."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Collectively, results show sometimes significant spatial variability to storm surges in each of the estuaries studied. For both the October Windstorm and January Blizzard, surges were relatively similar at the mouths of each system (within about 0.1 m), but variability from mouth to head was as large as 1.2 m in some cases. Local effects in each estuary (i.e., friction and convergence) therefore dominated variability in this study. It is also important to note a few inconsistencies in this study. Conclusions have been made that the effect of shallow water and friction is to delay and dampen tides and surges, yet near the head of the Penobscot where depths are significantly shallower than the bay, surges only amplify. Either convergent effects dominate friction in that system (Friedrichs and Aubrey, 1994) or other nonmorphological factors like tide-surge interaction become important. Tide-surge interaction is therefore investigated further in the next chapter to elucidate these differences.\nNonlinear tide-surge interaction more than doubled total surge levels and amplified upstream. The contributions from the sixth and eighth diurnal oscillations in storm surge accounted for most of the interaction term during both storms. In order to understand why D6 and D8 oscillations of tide-surge interaction are enhanced during storm events, the physical mechanisms that contribute to each must be determined."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "An experiment conducted in three estuarine systems on the central coast of Maine in the Fall and Winter of 2017 / 2018 provided tide and storm surge data within estuaries of varying morphology. Data collection for this project was possible through the volunteer work of citizen scientists who provided data sets at 16 of 22 measurement locations. Data collection by the citizen scientists was generally reliable if sensors were placed in good locations (no low water exposure and little ice interference) and successfully recorded data. This water level data, coupled with that collected by UMaine researchers, provides records of tides and surge in regions of the state that previously had none and was sent to the National Weather Service to aid in model development. Storm surge modeling and adaptation efforts currently are focused on the coast. This research has shown that inland storm surge levels are controlled by morphological influences, and depending on the influence, can promote much larger water levels than those observed at the coast. This draws the need to improve storm surge predictions in inland waterways, so they can be considered in climate change adaptation decisions in the future. CHAPTER 3\nWater level measurements at three locations in Penobscot Bay over one fall / winter season allowed for the identification of two significant storm surge events that produced surges with tidal frequencies. The component to surge oscillating at tidal frequencies, the tide-surge interaction, was found to have D6 and D8 components larger in amplitude than the principal tidal component (D2). Observations of currents, river discharge, wind, and tides suggest that increased current velocities from storm related mechanisms can considerably amplify the D6 tide through nonlinear quadratic friction. Observations also show if storm induced currents dominate tidal currents, significant D6 interaction can span multiple tidal cycles independent of tidal phase. Externally generated surges can create larger surge induced currents than internally generated surges, and so produce larger amplitude oscillations. During both storms studied, the D8 interaction becomes larger than the D6 due to resonance. The amplified D6 and D8 tides during some storm events can create a total tide-surge interaction that more than doubles the surge created from low-frequency linear mechanisms and oscillates at a relatively rapid frequency between 6 and 8 cycles per day. Observations collectively show that tidesurge interaction generated at overtide frequencies can sometimes be more significant than lowfrequency storm surges in estuaries with strong frictional effects. Systems with a natural frequency near the frequency of these oscillations can expect storm surges to get stronger through enhancement of the tide-surge interaction by climate change induced sea level rise."}, {"section_title": "TIDE-SURGE INTERACTION IN THE PENOBSCOT ESTUARY", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Storm surges present a significant risk to life and property in coastal communities. Recent studies predict that climate change can regionally increase storminess, storm surge heights (Lowe and Gregory, 2005), and tidal ranges (Devlin et al., 2017;Holleman and Stacey, 2014), collectively enhancing the threat of flooding from storm surge. Furthermore, nonlinear components of the tide are expected to increase with sea level rise (Holleman and Stacey, 2014), thereby increasing the complexity of flood forecasting. The socioeconomic loss associated with coastal flooding can be significant (e.g. 80,000 businesses negatively affected by Hurricane Katrina in 2005) (Petterson et al., 2006), demonstrating the need to improve the current understanding of storm surges to improve predictions and mitigate damage on the coast. Storm surges are quantified from the difference between predicted tides and observed water levels during storm events and can be comprised of both linear and nonlinear components (e.g. Horsburgh and Wilson, 2007). Low-frequency surge is the linear component to surge which modifies the subtidal water level during storm events and is created from wind set-up and atmospheric pressure differentials (Pond and Pickard, 1983). Tide-surge interaction is the nonlinear component and is manifested as an oscillation to surge at tidal frequencies. Tide-surge interaction can be created one of two ways: tides modifying an externally generated surge and/or locally generated surge modifying the tides, with each case dependant on how surge propagates relative to the tide (Rossiter, 1961;Horsburgh and Wilson, 2007). Many coastal flood and storm surge models assume only low-frequency surge for simplicity (e.g. Alvarez Fanjul et al., 2001;Glahn et al., 2009) which neglects complex, nonlinear components. This simplified approach is not always sufficient, with some studies calculating root mean square errors of total water levels at about 70% of linearly predicted water levels (Qin, 1994), showing that tide-surge interaction can be significant. Fig. 17 shows how tide-surge interaction creates coastal flooding by significantly increasing the total water level above that predicted with only low frequency surge. This interaction has been identified at varying levels of significance dependent on the region, with classical theory broadly identifying shallow water and friction as the main driving mechanisms (Proudman, 1955 a,b;Rossiter, 1961). The equations modeling tide and surge from these studies do not often match observations, indicating the mechanisms creating tide-surge interaction are inherently more complicated than the models can predict. Recent studies on nonlinear surge emphasize the development of tide-surge interaction over the shelf regions on the coast. Atmospheric pressure (Mercer et al., 2002) and wind (e.g. Rego and Li, 2010;Feng et al. 2016) often play an important role in the creation of the interaction, but other factors like steepness of the continental shelf and wave set-up (Nayak et al, 2012) can also contribute. Most studies ultimately found nonlinear bottom friction as the dominant mechanism causing the interactions (e.g. Rego and Li, 2010;Feng et al., 2016;Wolf, 1978;Valle-Levinson, 2013;Jones and Davies, 2008), but some interaction can be attributed to nonlinearities caused by shallow water and advection as well (Rego and Li, 2010;Wolf, 1978). In some cases, the shallow water effect can dominate over friction (Wolf, 1981). Generally, tide-surge interaction at the coast has been well-studied around the world, and the mechanisms that influence the interaction are well understood over shelf regions. In estuaries, nonlinear effects from shallow water and friction on the coast are known to amplify through other mechanisms (e.g. overtides) (Parker, 1991), but a basic understanding of how those mechanisms effect estuarine storm surges has not fully developed. Further, the present work on tide-surge interaction in estuaries is confined to only a few locations in the world. The influence of linearized shallow water and friction on storm surges was first investigated in the Thames estuary in the 1950s through a 1-dimensional theoretical model assuming an externally forced tide and surge (Proudman, 1955 a,b). This general solution assumes the tide and surge propagate in-phase into an estuary of uniform width, but with this assumption the theoretical solution only often matches observations near the immediate ocean boundary. Proudman's analytical framework was expanded upon with a numerical model specifying different forcing combinations of tides and diurnal periodicity surges into an estuary of exponentially decaying width (Rossiter, 1961). Both models show the same general conclusions on externally generated surge: larger water levels from surge allow for faster tidal propagation, while reduced water levels decrease tidal propagation speed. These analyses neglect locally generated surge, do not separate the contributions of shallow water and friction, and miss other surge mechanics of the system as results are often inaccurate. Further investigation into the topic continued with parallel numerical models of tidal propagation and surge propagation, the first such analysis to investigate both types of tide-surge interaction (Prandle and Wolf, 1978). Quadratic friction is determined to be the principal interaction term in that system, irrespective of the phase relationship between tide and surge. Furthermore, discrepancies in previous model-data comparisons result from the neglected quadratic friction mechanism. A recent numerical model improves the former research further, confirming conclusions on quadratic friction, but also identifying differences in tidesurge interaction modes between externally and locally generated surge (Horsburgh and Wilson, 2007). All the former models focus on modification to/from the principal tide, and none can explain how changes to higher order harmonics (4th diurnal and larger) is displayed in surge. Prandle and Wolf (1978) identify significant overtide frequencies in surge and Horsburgh and Wilson (2007) note their model cannot explain some peak residual modes, likely due to modification of higher order tides. The objectives of this work, therefore, are to elucidate the role of higher harmonic tides in estuarine tidesurge interaction and to determine the relative contributions of nonlinear tide-surge interaction to overall surge levels. The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows. Section 3.2 describes the study site, field measurements, and data analysis. Section 3.3 describes the observations from the field campaign and what was found from the analysis. Section 3.4 discusses the results and observations and describes the major findings of the study. Lastly, conclusions will be presented in section 3.5."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods:", "text": "3.2.1 Study Site: Data for this research were collected in the Penobscot River estuary located on the central coast of Maine in the United States (Fig.18). The Penobscot estuary, comprised of bay and river sections, is a long, converging, and deep estuary extending approximately 100 km from the Atlantic Ocean near Rockland to the head at Eddington, 6 km north of Bangor. The width of the estuary varies from nearly 30 km in the lower bay to 0.24 km at Bangor. Maximum average depths range from 120 m near the mouth to 30 m at the confluence with the river (boxed area in Fig. 18[b]). Average depths in the riverine portion of the system then decrease to 5.5 m at Bangor. The primary sources of freshwater are the Penobscot River and Kenduskeag Stream at Bangor. The mean annual discharge at the confluence of these rivers is 396 m 3 /s and the 100-year peak flood is 3370 m 3 /s (Hodgkins, 1999). High runoff periods generally occur during the spring freshet (April to May) with a mean monthly discharge of 1105 m 3 /s, while the lowest runoff period is typically September with a mean monthly discharge of 140 m 3 /s (Dudley, 2004). The tidal range in the estuary ranges from about 2.9 m during neap tides to 4.9 m during spring tides and tidal velocity amplitudes range from 0.7 m/s on neap tides to 1.3 m/s on springs (Geyer and Ralston, 2018).  "}, {"section_title": "Environmental Conditions", "text": "Barometric pressure and wind data were collected in Castine and Bangor ( Fig. 18 [b] The results of this study focus on two storm events: October 30, 2017 and January 4 to 5, 2018. Water level data were analyzed in two-month periods: October to November and December to January. Rockport and Bangor were used for October / November and Belfast and Bangor for December / January. Data from Belfast and Rockport were collected in monthly segments, so segments were concatenated and interpolated onto a uniform grid to create a continuous two-month time series. A harmonic analysis and data filtering process was conducted to extract components of surge from water level measurements, following Feng et al. (2016). Water levels in the two-month segments were demeaned and spikes were removed by removal and interpolation with surrounding data. Predicted tides were then computed using the T_Tide Matlab toolbox (Pawlowicz et al., 2002). T_Tide was also used to determine the tidal amplitudes of the diurnal (D1), semi-diurnal (D2), quarter-diurnal (D4), sixth-diurnal (D6), and eighth-diurnal (D8) frequency bands, with D4, D4, and D4 including direct overtides of the M2: M4, M6, and M8, respectively. The D1 band includes all signals with periods between 21 and 30 hours, the D2 covers 11 to 14.5 hours, the D4 covers 5.5 to 7 hours, the D6 covers 4 to 4.5 hours, and the D8 includes 2.7 to 3.2 hours. Bands, rather than specific harmonics, were resolved because the signal reconstruction analysis described in 2.3.2 does not always allow for specific harmonics to be re-created. Amplitudes for each band for each time period were determined by summing all harmonic amplitudes within each band. At each station, the total surge (TS) was computed by subtracting the predicted tide (PT) from the demeaned observed total water levels (TWL). The total surge is comprised of a tidal component and non-tidal component. The non-tidal surge, called low frequency surge (LFS) was extracted from the residual using a Fourier low-pass filter with a cut-off period of 30 hours (Walters and Heston, 1982), thus excluding all tidal frequencies that are diurnal and higher. An average form factor of 0.11 in the estuary shows the tides are mixed, mainly semidiurnal, justifying this cut-off period. Low-frequency surge represents the demeaned subtidal water level and includes influences from river discharge, as well as wind and pressure-driven storm surge. The tide-surge interaction term (I), was calculated by subtracting LFS from TS. The interaction term physically represents either how the tide changes an externally generated, propagating kelvin wave (i.e. storm surge) or how water level residuals modify the tides. Fig. 19 conceptually shows these components to TWL relative to mean sea level and how the summation of PT, LFS and I can produce water levels larger than PT+LFS when nonlinear surge (I) amplifies. The harmonic analysis was also applied to the current velocities to distinguish tidal current velocities from residual current velocities influenced by other mechanisms, such as wind, storm surge and river discharge. [a] represents the total water level when tide-surge interaction is negligible."}, {"section_title": "Wavelet Transforms and Reconstruction of Tides and Tide-Surge Interaction", "text": "To understand the mechanisms creating tide-surge interaction, the specific tidal and overtide frequencies in I need to be identified. To do this, a wavelet analysis (Torrence and Compo, 1998) was performed on each time series of I using a Morlet base function. Wavelets were also created for PT at each location to highlight how the tide-surge interaction manifested itself in water levels. For all sets of wavelets (PT and I), signals were re-created at the D2, D4, D6, and D8 bands to identify exact variations in amplitude and phase of each band around storm events. All data at each location was interpolated onto grids with a 15 second time interval prior to wavelet analysis to ensure equal comparison. The tidal and overtide signals in both PT and I were reconstructed according to Torrence and Compo (1998), as the sum of the real part of the wavelet transform over the scales of each frequency: where is the unitless reconstruction factor, taken as 0.776 and (0) is the unitless energy scaling factor, taken as , both of which are constant for a Morlet wavelet base (Torrence and Compo, 1998). \u03b4j determines the resolution of scales and is taken as 0.25, \u03b4t is the sampling interval of the time series, j and J are the lower and upper scales, respectively, of the band being reconstructed, \u211c is the real part of the wavelet transform at each scale, and sj is the scale itself: The reconstruction analysis elucidates how various components to the tide and surge change with time, which can be compared with environmental conditions to identify the forcing mechanisms contributing to each harmonic. This harmonic analysis, decomposition, and reconstruction analysis was repeated on along-channel (north-south) currents to investigate how quadratic friction ( | | ) was modified during each event."}, {"section_title": "Storm Events", "text": "Two storms in 2017 -2018 with varying storm tracks produced different storm surge patterns. The October 31st storm, locally referred to as the October Windstorm, was a hybrid storm created from the remnants of a tropical storm over the southeast states merging with a low-pressure system moving over the Great Lakes. This storm was a bomb cyclone, identified by a drop of over 24 mb in barometric pressure at the center in 24 hours, indicating rapid intensification. The center of the storm passed to the west of Maine from New York City into Canada (Fig. 21 [a]). Penobscot Bay was located on the eastern side of the storm, which promoted onshore 20 m/s winds and a barometric pressure minimum of 982 mb ( Fig. 22 [a]). River discharge was elevated (~750 m 3 /s) during the October Windstorm, compared to the mean annual discharge of 396 m 3 /s (Fig. 22 [b]). The January storm behaved like a more classic Nor'easter, producing blizzard conditions on the coast of New England. This storm, which will be referred to as the January Blizzard, was also a bomb cyclone but passed east of the Penobscot estuary over the Gulf of Maine and into the Canadian Maritimes (Fig. 21 [b]). Since the Penobscot region was on the west side of the storm, the significant 16 m/s winds were offshore (Fig. 22 [a]) and featured a barometric pressure minimum of 967 mb over the Penobscot River area. River discharge during the January Blizzard was markedly smaller than during the October Windstorm, roughly 200 m 3 /s ( Fig. 22 [b]). storm (Morrill et al., 1979). "}, {"section_title": "Tide-Surge Interaction", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Current Velocities", "text": "During the October Windstorm, subtidal currents were prominent and had contributions from wind, storm surge, density-induced flow, and river discharge. The subtidal flow featured maximum landward flow of about 0.37 m/s just prior to peak LFS (day 30.3 in Fig. 25 [a, b]), then reversed direction after peak LFS to a maximum seaward current of -0.33 m/s (day 30.9 in Fig. 25 [a, b]). Landward propagating LFS and a strong onshore wind (10 m/s N-S and -8.7 m/s E-W in Fig. 25 [a]) overcame seaward directed river flow and gravitational circulation to create the landward flow peak, while falling LFS, weaker winds blowing offshore (-2 m/s N-S and -3 m/s E-W in Fig. 25 [a]), gravitational circulation, and river flow created the seaward current peak of similar magnitude. Using a CD of 0.003 (Geyer, 1993) and h0 of 25 m, the quadratic friction terms were calculated for both PT and I at the D2 band ( Fig. 25 [c]). The amplitude of the quadratic friction from the interaction term increased from 0 to about 0.5 m/s 2 during and between the elevated subtidal currents (days 30 to 31.2 in Fig. 25). The PT friction was also in phase with the I friction during that time, creating an amplification in the D6 tide-surge interaction (Fig. 25 [c,d]). During the January Blizzard, velocity residuals were seaward for most of the surge event, suggesting strong influence from river, gravitational circulation, and offshore winds throughout the storm (Fig. 26 [a,b]). A brief period of landward residuals occurred when LFS started rising (day 35.1) but turned seaward and increased in magnitude as offshore winds increased until both current residuals (-0.3 m/s) and wind maximized (-7.4 m/s N-S and 3 m/s E-W) at the end of the LFS (day 36.3 in Fig. 26 [a , b]). Quadratic friction from the D2 band of I was near zero during the time LFS influenced the estuary (days 35 to 36.3 in Fig. 26 [c]) and so the D6 interaction term does not increase relative to non-storm conditions ( Fig. 26 [d]).  measurements are from Bangor with the remainder taken at Castine."}, {"section_title": "D2 Tide and Surge Interaction from River Discharge", "text": "The largest tide-surge interaction in the D2 band occurred during the October Windstorm, and presented a positive interaction on each ebb tide and a negative on flood. The summation of I and PT in this scenario represents a phase shifted tide that lags PT. The phase shift results in TS values lower than LFS on flood tide, and higher than LFS on ebb. Previous tide-surge interaction studies observe storm surge peaks during flood tide because PT+I precede PT as the shallow water wave speed increases in deeper water (e.g. Prandle and Wolf, 1978;Horsburgh and Wilson, 2007 and reference therein). During the October Windstorm, which occurred near the maximum river discharge during the study period ( Fig.   22 [a]), seaward mean flow from the river resulted in a phase shift of the tide. Using the shallow water wave speed equation (with mean flow): = + \u210e , where c is the wave speed, U0 is a depthuniform mean current, g is the gravitational constant, and h is a mean depth (Dean and Dalrymple, 1991); the effect of mean river flow on the tide can be estimated. Assuming a mean depth of 15 m, a shallow water wave propagating against a 0.75 m/s river current would arrive in Bangor 0.2 h later than one without a mean flow, matching the observed phase difference between P and PT+I (not shown). Furthermore, LFS surge peaks in Bangor 2.1 h after Rockport for this storm event, matching the expected travel time and providing justification for the slower rise to LFS peak than the fall. A simple correlation between river discharge and the phase difference between the D2, PT and PT+I was run on a 20-day time series around the storm (October 20th to November 9th in Fig. 22 [b]) to quantify this relationship, and the correlation coefficient was 0.74 with 95% CI of [0.59, 0.82], outlining good correlation. During the January Blizzard, river discharge is considerably lower (Fig. 22 [b]), and the D2 interaction is both lesser in amplitude than October, and opposite in its effect on tide and surge. The D2 interaction is positive on flood and negative on ebb, creating a surge that is larger on flood than ebb and more in line with findings from previous studies (e.g. Rossiter, 1961;Prandle and Wolf, 1978;Horsburgh and Wilson, 2007)."}, {"section_title": "High Frequency Tide-Surge Interaction", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Mechanisms Amplifying the D6 Band", "text": "The D6 and D8 components to I are larger in amplitude than any other for both storm events. The D8 band is formed from the interaction of the D6 and D2 bands. Quadratic friction is the only mechanism driving sixth-diurnal oscillations if the M2 harmonic is the principal tide (Parker, 1991). The D6 interaction term peaks when peak residual current velocities enhance tidal velocities on both phases of the tide. Currents from non-tidal mechanisms during the October Windstorm contributed to a landward subtidal flow pre-LFS peak, then a seaward subtidal flow near the end of LFS. Initial amplification of I in the D6 and quadratic friction from I in the D2 aligned with the landward flow; when a flood tide, northward winds, and externally generated LFS propagating landward collectively contributed to a net landward flow (Fig. 27). The amplified quadratic friction and D6 oscillation continued until after day 30.9, when an ebb tide, decreasing LFS, gravitational circulation, and large river flow (relative to average), created a net seaward flow (Fig. 28). Therefore, storm induced residual currents initially enhancing tidal currents created the amplified D6 oscillation, which maintained until residuals decreased back to magnitudes near that of PT. This is corroborated by a 0.86 correlation coefficient (with 95% CI of [0.82,0.88]) between 5 days (day 28 to 33) of north-south subtidal flow and the D6 interaction. The January Blizzard did not exhibit any clear enhancement in quadratic friction or I in the D6 band. Subtidal currents did not align with the amplifications in I as clearly as the October event, likely because the surge was locally generated and did not have a marked effect on subtidal flow. During the storm, as offshore winds increased, subtidal flow at Castine increased in magnitude seaward but did not enhance quadratic friction in the D2 band or interaction in the D6 (Fig. 26 [c,d]). It is possible that ice cover on the river north of Castine decreased the effect of wind on flows, and smaller contributions from river ( Fig. 22 [b]) and LFS ( Fig. 24 [a]) collectively created a scenario where quadratic friction could not be notably enhanced. Any minor enhancements to the D6 I amplitude were likely from the increase in water level associated with LFS. Further, the dampening of currents in general by ice cover on rivers (Georgas, 2012) could explain the smaller amplification and overall smaller difference in amplitude between I and PT during that event, particularly at Bangor ( Fig. 24 [d(1)]). "}, {"section_title": "Resonance in the D8 Band", "text": "The D8 band of PT+I (amplified tide) should only surpass the D6 if near resonance, per general compound tide theory (Parker, 1991). Results show this happens at points during both storm events (day 30.6 thru 30.8 in Fig. 25 [c] and day 35.9 thru 36.2 in Fig. 26 [c]), indicating the D8 band is near the natural frequency of the Penobscot estuary and is therefore close to resonance. When a harmonic is resonant, incident waves at that frequency moving into an estuary are constructively reinforced by reflected waves moving out, amplifying the harmonic. Although the Penobscot estuary is convergent in shape, the amplification in tidal amplitude from mouth to head (Fig. 20) shows it is a hypersynchronous system (convergence stronger than friction), meaning waves are more prone to reflect and create resonant conditions. A frequency can be tested for resonance by use of the quarter-wavelength relationship: where T is the wave period, L is the estuary length, g is the gravitational acceleration, and h is the mean depth of the estuary. Equation 7outlines that a wave will resonate when the natural frequency of the estuary is the same as the tidal frequency. The D8 PT+I amplitude exceeds D6 only in Bangor and for both events, indicating resonance is constrained to the shallower Penobscot River (Fig. 18). Using that approach, the length, L, used in Equation (7) is taken as the river length from Bangor to near the head of the bay, shown as the boxed area in Fig. 18 [b], where depths vary between 15 m and 5 m. With L = 28,000 m, and the average period of the D8 band, T = 3 h, the resonant depth, h, came to 11 m, which is deeper than the average depth calculated over the river section (8.5 m). An increase in mean water level from LFS is expected to bring the estuary closer to resonance, then, and is investigated next. There are five instances over the study period when the D8 PT+I is larger than the D6, and four occur when there is an increase in average depth from LFS that coincides with an increase in the D6 component of I. Further, the October Windstorm and January Blizzard created the largest and second largest of both LFS and D8 PT+I amplitudes, respectively. The onset of enhanced D8 oscillations can cause water levels to abruptly rise (~1.5 hrs) compared to typical LFS ( Fig. 23 [a 1] and 24 [a 1]), presenting potentially conditions hazardous to life and property. Similar scenarios of enhanced overtides from resonance could therefore be expected in other hypersynchronous estuaries. Tidal amplitudes in each system would determine the strength of oscillations, with larger tidal ranges creating larger overtides and high frequency surge. High frequency tide-surge interaction from amplification of higher frequency harmonics is therefore an important part of TS in some estuaries but has been widely ignored by former research."}, {"section_title": "Historical Support", "text": "On February 2, 1976, a coastal storm flooded downtown Bangor after producing a 3.2 m storm surge (Morrill et al, 1979). The storm passed over western Maine following a similar track to the October Windstorm ( Fig. 21 [a]). A central pressure of 964 mb was recorded in western Maine and maximum sustained winds of 21 m/s toward the northwest were recorded at Bangor. Observed water levels in Camden, 3 km north of Rockport, were 1 m higher than expected and 3.2 m larger than PT in Bangor. It is estimated that it took 15 minutes for the flood to reach its maximum water depth in Bangor, which occurred 1 hour before high tide. Records of the storm in 1976 depict a very similar scenario to the October Windstorm. It was suspected that the rapid onset of flooding in Bangor was a result of an ice dam, however, the results of the present work suggest that high frequency tide-surge interaction can also product abruptly rising flood levels."}, {"section_title": "Comparison to Previous Research and Models", "text": "Previous work on tide-surge interaction in estuaries has generally ignored the contribution at the overtide frequencies, although some have acknowledged their existence in observations (eg. Prandle and Wolf, 1978;Horsburgh and Wilson, 2007). Classic work utilizes models which either linearize terms (analytically (Proudman 1955 a,b) and numerically (Rossiter, 1961)) or only allow nonlinear terms to be manifested in surge as a phase shift of tide or surge relative to a non-stormy state (Prandle and Wolf;1978). Consequently, the observations associated with these studies focus on the mechanisms their models account for, and so neglect higher order nonlinearities. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to identify and diagnose the development of 6th and 8th diurnal oscillations to storm surge generated by enhanced storm-induced currents. This work demonstrates that the manner in which LFS manifests within an estuary determines the magnitude of these currents and oscillations, expanding upon the differences between externally and internally generated storm surge outlined in Horsburgh and Wilson (2007). The previously ignored nonlinear effects from overtide harmonics must be considered to accurately forecast surge in inland systems. Results from NOAA's numerical Extratropical Storm Surge (ETSS) model (Liu, 2019) during the October Windstorm reveal large the discrepancies between observed TWL and forecasted when nonlinear effects are significant (Fig. 28). It is important to note, the ETSS model strictly includes tide and surge in determining TWL, and therefore do not capture increased water levels from river discharge. By subtracting PT from TWL in Bangor immediately before the event, the contribution to TWL from elevated river discharge was estimated to be about 0.35 m. With that assumption, the model still underpredicts the TWL by 1.6 m in Bangor on day 30.4 ( Fig. 28), showing that amplified higher harmonics result in discrepancies between observed and forecasted surges. "}, {"section_title": "Effect of Climate Change", "text": "Mean sea level (MSL) has been increasing globally at a rate near 1.7 mm yr -1 according to estimations from coastal and island tide gauge measurements from 1900-2009, and near 3.4 mm yr -1 according to satellite imagery estimates for 1993-2016 (Nerem et al., 2010;Church and White, 2011), with a net increase in MSL from 0.5 m to 1.2 m likely by 2100 (Kopp et al., 2012). These rates are not constant world-wide, and climate models suggest that they will accelerate in coming years (Nicholls and White, 2010), making prediction capabilities harder. Increasing sea levels promote more favorable conditions for resonance of the D8 harmonic in systems of similar tides, length, and depth. Considering the ideal depth for resonance is about 11 m in the Penobscot and the mean depth is near 8.5 m, any increase in MSL between those points will enhance the resonance effects. Thus, sea level rise will effectively amplify tide-surge interaction making scenarios like the October Windstorm and February 1976 storm more frequent."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 4 CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The results of this thesis outline the presence of sometimes significant variability to estuarine storm surges based on bathymetry, morphology, and nonlinear tide-surge interaction. The NOAA ETSS model includes Penobscot Bay but does not have fine enough resolution to forecast surges within the smaller Bagaduce River, Bass Harbor, and Southwest Harbor (Liu, 2019). The coastal forecasts which are then applied to the small systems from lack of data are not always accurate, and even in the Penobscot, model results were shown to underpredict storm surges because of nonlinear tide-surge interaction. With a large portion of coastal communities in Maine and elsewhere being on estuaries, this draws the need to increase forecasting capabilities of surges inland of the immediate coast. Climate change induced sea level rise is expected to worsen high frequency tide-surge interaction in some systems like the Penobscot, adding more urgency to improving models. To provide the best storm surge forecasts to all tidally influenced coastlines in the world, more robust models must be developed which incorporate nonlinear tide-surge interaction and higher resolution bathymetric and morphological features."}]
