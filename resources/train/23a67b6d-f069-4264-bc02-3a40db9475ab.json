Introduction", "text": "Over the past decade, many U.S. school districts have pushed their high school morning bell times later in response to surveys suggesting that teens are not getting enough sleep and evidence from sleep scientists suggesting that children's circadian rhythms shift to later in the day as they enter adolescence. 1 Poor or little sleep is correlated with higher rates of obesity, lower cognitive performance, and higher rates of depression. Therefore, shifting to later start times has the promise of increasing both sleep and academic achievement.\nHowever, changing bell times often occurs with much disruption to local communities' schedules, because many schools originally set early schedules for high schools to implement less-expensive multiple-tiered busing schedules. Opponents of later start times argue that, in addition to raising busing costs, later start times would negatively affect students' participation in sports, after-school jobs, and other extracurricular activities (Sleep in Fairfax 2013) . Early start times, however, may not be detrimental to learning if students are able to adapt to waking up early or if teachers are more productive with early schedules.\nThe link between school start times and achievement has received much attention in the popular press, by the health community, and even by Congress. House Concurrent Resolution 176, introduced to Congress in 2007 as the \"Zzz's to A's Resolution\" but not passed, called for secondary schools nationwide to begin the school day after 9:00 A.M. Recently, the American Academy of Pediatrics (2014) recommended that \"in most districts, middle and high schools should aim for a starting time of no earlier than 8:30 A.M.\" If delaying start times causes students to get more sleep, students may experience increases in health outcomes and cognitive performance and ultimately academic achievement. Some recent papers by economists (Carrell, Maghakian, and West 2011; Edwards 2012; Hinrichs 2010; Wong 2011 ) have examined whether changing school start times results in a positive effect on measurable academic outcomes, with mixed results.\nThe goals of this paper are to examine whether school start times affect (1) students' decisions to pursue a college degree and (2) student learning as measured by college-entrance exam scores and high school completion.

Male students also get more sleep, but we observe negative effects on their four-year college attendance."}, {"section_title": "II. Background and Literature Review", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A. Sleep Patterns and Sleep Science", "text": "A sleep-laboratory study among adolescents given a 10-hour sleep opportunity suggested that adolescents need on average 9.2 hours of sleep each night (Carskadon et al. 1980) .\nRecently, the National Sleep Foundation recommended that teenagers (aged 14-17) sleep between 8 and 10 hours each night (Hirshkowitz et al. 2015) . However, a national survey of adolescents found that adolescents in high school reported sleeping on average only 7.2 hours on the typical school night (National Sleep Foundation 2006 delaying bell times would allow students to get more sleep, which would promote cognitive functioning during the school day and improve academic achievement (e.g., Jacob and Rockoff 2011; National Sleep Foundation 2013) .\nThese claims have a basis in sleep science. Sleep scientists postulate that sleep/wake behavior in humans is coordinated by two processes: a circadian timing system and a homeostatic system (Borbely 1982) . The circadian system is associated with the hormone melatonin, is influenced by light and darkness, and tends to make humans tired during the nighttime hours. The homeostatic system provides sleep pressure that increases the longer a person is awake and decreases with sleep. There is some evidence that the circadian system of humans undergoes a phase shift in adolescence (associated with puberty) toward later bedtimes and later wake-up times (Carskadon, Vieira, and Acebo 1993) . A later sleep/wake cycle may also be promoted by a slower accumulation of homeostatic sleep pressure, allowing adolescents to stay awake longer (Crowley, Acebo, and Carskadon 2007) .\nIn addition to biological factors, environmental factors appear to contribute to the later sleep/wake cycle of adolescents. These factors include reduced parental influence on bedtimes, increased homework, and extracurricular activities such as sports, music, and part-time employment (Carskadon 1990) . In short, the evidence from sleep science argues that early start times are in conflict with the desired sleep patterns of adolescents. Environmental influences 2 Estimates from time diaries suggest that adolescents actually sleep slightly longer than estimates from surveys about usual hours (e.g., Kalenkoski and Pabilonia 2012) . The time-diary estimates from the PSID-CDS and ATUS both fall close to the lower bound of the appropriate sleep-duration range for adolescents as specified in the National Sleep Foundation's recommendations (Hirshkowitz et al. 2015) .\nand changes in biological systems may limit the ability of students to make adequate adjustments to early start times."}, {"section_title": "B. Start Times and Academic Achievement", "text": "Our paper investigates the relationship between starting times in high school and academic achievement. A small number of papers have investigated this relationship, and the evidence is mixed. The earliest research in this area used data from the Minneapolis-St. Paul (Minnesota) metropolitan area, where Minneapolis and several suburban districts shifted to later bell times for their high schools (starting in 1997-98) but St. Paul and other suburban districts maintained early schedules. Wahlstrom (2002) examined Minneapolis high schools before and after the change and found that attendance rates increased and grades improved slightly.\nHowever, Hinrichs (2010) found no effect of starting times on achievement in an analysis that involved data from both schools that changed schedules and those that did not change schedules.\nUsing individual-level ACT test-score data for students in the region who took the test for several years before and after the policy change, Hinrichs found that students who attended high schools with later start times did no better on the ACT than students who attended high schools with earlier start times. Hinrichs obtained similar results using school-level data on starting times and scores on statewide standardized tests from Kansas and Virginia.\nIn contrast, Wong (2011) Maghakian, and West (2011) also provide evidence that suggests a positive effect of later start times, at least for older teenagers. They examined college students in their first year at the U.S.\nAir Force Academy, where freshmen are randomly assigned to courses and schedules. They found that students who began the school day later in the morning performed better in all of their courses taken that day compared with students who began the day earlier in the morning.\nRelated literature addresses whether the time of day that students attend a class affects their performance. Cortes, Bricker, and Rohlfs (2012) found that high school students in Chicago Public Schools received lower grades and were more likely to be absent from a class when it met in first period than when it met later in the day. Dills and Hernandez-Julian (2008) found that college students at Clemson University received higher grades in a class if it met later in the day. High school students performed better on cognitive tests given in the afternoon than in the morning (Hansen et al. 2005) ."}, {"section_title": "C. Mechanisms", "text": "According to several strands of literature, the primary mechanism connecting high school start time and academic achievement is sleep. There is general evidence that school attendance is associated with sleep loss. Students sleep less on weekdays during the school year than during the summer, and during the school year they sleep less on school nights than on weekends (Crowley et al. 2007; Hansen et al. 2005; Stewart 2014 ). Moreover, surveys have found that students of all ages who start school earlier in the day obtained less total sleep on school nights Knutson and Lauderdale 2009; Stewart 2014; Wolfson and Carskadon 1998; Wolfson et al. 2007 "}, {"section_title": "III.

In our regressions, we control for the length of the school day so that our estimates are the effects of starting the school day later without changing its length (as in Hinrichs 2010).\nThe length of the school day is created by taking the difference between the school end time and start time."}, {"section_title": "B. Sample Construction", "text": "We examine a subsample of CDS respondents who were enrolled in grades 9-12 in a fulltime public high school in either CDS-II (2002-03) or CDS-III (2007-08). To be included in our sample, students must have reported a weekday school-year diary and attended a high school class on that diary day. In addition, the respondent must have complete information on our main academic outcomes from the TA surveys. We examine only respondents who lived with a single parent, two biological parents, or a biological parent and stepparent. We exclude diaries where the student reported being sick on the diary day, which could significantly affect time allocation on the school-day diary. In addition, we drop a few students from the sample because they were missing information on race, free or reduced-price lunch recipient status, usual night sleep, and sadness in past two weeks. We also drop 50 students for whom we were not able to determine school start time. 7 Appendix Table A2 details our sample construction. Our main analysis sample includes 670 respondents -340 females and 330 males -who attended 510 unique high schools. We conduct separate analyses by gender because of the huge differences in schooling achievement and time use between males and females (Goldin et al. 2006; Jacob 2002; Kalenkoski and Pabilonia 2013) ."}, {"section_title": "C. Academic Outcomes", "text": "Our main dependent variables include both short-run and long-run academic outcomes:\nhigh school graduation, taking a college-entrance exam, scores on college-entrance exams, broad-reading and applied-problem standardized test scores on the Woodcock Johnson Revised 7 Observation counts are rounded to the nearest ten in accordance with NCES disclosure requirements.\nTests of Basic Achievement (WJ-R) that were administered at the time of the high school CDS child interview, college attendance by age 20, four-year college attendance, and selective college attendance. Table 1 includes overall sample means for the academic outcomes as well as their means in four categories defined by school start times.\nHigh school graduation is equal to 1 if the student reported earning a high school diploma in a follow-up TA and 0 if the student did not earn a diploma or they earned a GED. 8 TA respondents were asked about college attendance and college-entrance exams only if they had graduated from high school or earned a GED. We use an indicator for taking a college-entrance exam as a measure of a student's intention to pursue postsecondary education. This variable is equal to 1 if the student reported taking the SAT or ACT, and 0 otherwise. We measure scores on college-entrance exams using the combined (math + reading) SAT score; for students who took the ACT but not the SAT, we use their ACT composite score and concordance tables (Dorans et al. 1997; College Board 2009 ) to create a predicted (combined) SAT score. Average college-entrance exam scores reported in Table 1 are only for those who took a test.\nCollege attendance by age 20 is equal to 1 if the TA respondent reported in the TA that he/she attended a college before turning age 20; it is equal to 0 otherwise. 9 This is a good indicator of long-term achievement because students who enroll in college directly after high school are more likely to attend four-year colleges and have higher college-graduation rates (Bozick and DeLuca 2005) . In addition, we define four-year college attendance equal to 1 if the TA respondent reported that the first college he/she attended before turning age 20 was a fouryear college and 0 otherwise. We determine selective college attendance based primarily upon the 2008 Barron's rankings of college competitiveness. Selective college attendance is equal to 1 if the first college that the TA respondent attended before turning age 20 was a four-year college ranked between \"highly competitive\" and \"competitive,\" and 0 otherwise."}, {"section_title": "10", "text": "Given long-run trends in high school graduation rates (Goldin 1998) , it is not surprising that we find that female students were more likely than male students to graduate from high school (96 percent versus 90 percent). 11 In addition, female students were more likely to have attended any college by age 20 (85 percent versus 80 percent), more likely to have attended a four-year college (48 percent versus 39 percent), and more likely to have attended a selective four-year college (38 percent versus 32 percent). Female students were more likely to report taking a college-entrance exam (82 percent versus 77 percent), perhaps indicative of gender differences in the types of colleges attended. Male students scored slightly higher than female students on the SAT. Male students scored higher than female students on the WJ-R appliedproblems test.\nWhen we examine the means of the academic outcomes across four start-time categories, we find three striking relationships. For female students, we find that those who started between 7:00 A.M. A.M. were more likely to attend college than were those who started at 8:00 A.M. or later. For both sexes, we find that those who started between 7:00 A.M. and 7:29 A.M were much more likely to attend a four-year college (especially a selective four-year college) than were those who started at 7:30 A.M. or later. In our econometric analyses, we examine the relationship between academic outcomes and school start time with a rich set of controls for individual, family, school, and community characteristics."}, {"section_title": "D. Intermediate Outcomes", "text": "In addition to the academic outcomes, we examine numerous intermediate outcomes,\neach of which could be affected by start times. Some of these are created from the time diaries, while others are from general survey questions. All measures of time spent on an activity are reported in hours per day. We argue that measures of time spent on an activity that are aggregated from time-use diaries are preferable to measures of \"usual\" time spent because they are less subject to both aggregation bias and social desirability bias (Juster, Ono, and Stafford 2003) . We consider the effects of school start time on students' sleep, sports participation, homework, screen time, time with parents, employment, weight, and mood.\nWe examine three measures of sleep -all diary sleep, night diary sleep, and usual sleep.\nThe two diary-sleep measures are intended to measure sleep on school nights. 12 We use weekday diaries but exclude Fridays because Friday bedtime corresponds to a weekend schedule.\nUsual sleep is obtained from the child-interview portion of the PSID-CDS rather than the time diary. We assume that the usual night sleep reported by students is for a weeknight, because the questionnaire asked \"What time do you usually go to bed on weeknights?\" just prior to asking about a usual night's sleep. 12 In a future draft, we will examine the effects of school start times on sleep on weekends to examine if they are able to \"catch up\" on sleep.\nAs shown in Table 2 , there is little difference in the sample means between all diary sleep and night diary sleep (a difference of 0.18 and 0.22 hour for females and males, respectively)."}, {"section_title": "13", "text": "In most cases, night sleep includes parts of two sleep episodes: the first episode is the latter part of the sleep cycle begun the day prior to the diary, and the second episode is the first part of the sleep cycle begun on the day of the diary. Female high school students sleep on average 7.93 hours per night on weekdays but report sleeping only 7.30 hours on a \"usual\" night. Male students sleep slightly more -on average 8.09 hours per night on their diary day and 7.57 hours on a \"usual\" night.\nIn addition to examining the effect of start times on sleep time, we consider how start times affect students' wake-up times and bedtimes. Wake-up time is defined as the end time of last night-sleep episode occurring before 1:00 P.M. on Monday through Thursday diary days.\n14 Consistent with prior research (Crowley et al. 2007 ), female students wake up earlier than male students on school mornings (5 minutes earlier on average). Bedtime is defined as either the start time of the last recorded night-sleep episode (if beginning after noon on the diary day) or the start time of the first night episode that begins at or after midnight but before noon (if the former episode does not exist) on Monday through Thursday diary days. 15 Female students go to bed two minutes later on average. 13 One criticism of the diary measure that should not affect our estimates of the effect of school start times is that night sleep can include sleeplessness (Eide and Showalter 2012) . In Appendix Table A3 , we present separate estimates of diary night sleep and sleeplessness on school nights from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) for a sample of high school students aged 15-18. In the ATUS, we find little reporting on sleeplessness, and teens' night sleep is actually slightly longer than that reported in the PSID-CDS. Even though the ATUS diary runs from 4 A.M. on one day to 4 A.M. on the next day, the duration of the last activity (usually sleep) is obtained. Therefore, the ATUS measures a complete night-sleep episode. 14 Some students report starting several night-sleep episodes in the early-morning hours, with other short spells of another activity in between periods of sleep. Although Friday diary days could also be used to examine wake-up times, we do not include them so that our estimated effects on night sleep, bedtime, and wake-up time are for the same sample. 15 Bedtime is measured in hours. For bedtimes after midnight, we add 24 hours so that they occur after bedtimes before midnight.\nIt is often argued by opponents of later start times that moving the high school day later would mean that sports teams cannot practice or would have to shorten their practices due to less daylight after school (National Sleep Foundation 2005a). Opponents also argue that students' afterschool employment will be negatively affected (National Sleep Foundation 2005b). We examine two indicators of sports participation. One, from the child-interview portion of the CDS, is whether the student participates in an athletic or sports team at school during that academic year. The other is whether the student participates in an afterschool sport on the diary day. On average, male students are more likely to participate in sports than female students. We examine two measures of employment. One is whether the student is currently employed. The second is the number of hours worked on the weekday diary.\nProponents of later start times argue that students will be less tired if they start school later and thus be more efficient at doing their homework; however, they may also be more rested and thus able to do more homework, resulting in better grades. Indeed, Edwards (2012) found that students spent more time doing homework when schools started later. We examine two measures of homework time from the time diary. One is homework time on the weekday diary, and the other is a weighted average of the weekday and weekend-day homework times. For these measures, we include only homework time that was recorded as a primary activity."}, {"section_title": "16", "text": "School start times may also affect the amount of time that students spend with their parents on weekdays, due to the degree of synchronization between school schedules and parents' work schedules. We measure time with parents as the sum of all hours on activities where the student reported being in the same room with a parent while at home or accompanying a parent while away from the home. We measure a student's being overweight using an indicator for whether the student's age and gender-specific BMI percentile was equal to85 or greater (i.e., being considered overweight or obese according to the CDC). Male students are more likely than female students to be considered overweight (37 percent versus 25 percent).\nProponents of later start times argue that the lack of sleep resulting from early start times contributes to students' mood problems (Wahlstrom 2002) . We measure students' mood with an indicator for whether the student was \"many times\" or \"always\" sad in the last two weeks. "}, {"section_title": "E. Control Variables", "text": "In our analysis, we include a rich set of controls for individual, family, high school, school-district, and county characteristics. Our individual controls include indicators for black race and Hispanic ethnicity, Census region in high school, and cohort (based on the year in which the student would typically take a college-entrance exam). The cohort control (implemented with a set of dummy variables) accounts for the age/grade in which students were interviewed, broad trends in education, and changes in test scoring or composition. 17 To proxy for ability, we include age-adjusted broad-reading and applied-problems standardized-test scores from the Woodcock-Johnson Revised Tests of Basic Achievement (WJ-R) that were given during the CDS child interview occurring about five years prior to the CDS high school 17 In 2005, the SAT added a writing section, changed the content of the math and reading sections, and increased the time and cost of the test (Jacobsen 2013 observation. 18 Tests taken at that time are more likely to measure inherent ability (as opposed to achievement) than tests taken during high school.\nWe control for several family characteristics, including whether the mother has a college degree, whether the student lives with two parents, the number of biological siblings in the family unit, and whether the student received a free or reduced-price lunch at school. In the high school graduation, test-score, and college-by-20 regressions, we also control for whether students were living in a state that mandated that all high school students take the ACT or SAT. We control for several high school-level characteristics: the student-teacher ratio, the fraction white, the fraction eligible for free-or reduced-price lunch, log of the number of students, and urbanicity indicators (suburban, town, and rural). We control for log of the median household income in the school district and the log of the population density in the county where the high school is located. Our intent is to control for school or community factors that might be correlated with both achievement and start times. For example, districts located in the suburbs of major cities tend to have above-average schools and traffic congestion (as proxied by population density); congestion is one factor in districts choosing multiple-tiered busing schedules, which typically involve early start times for high schools.\nTo motivate our choice of school, district, and county controls, we estimate a series of regressions using the school-level data in the 2007-08 SASS. The dependent variable in the regressions is school start time (coded in hours since midnight), and each regression has a different set of controls. The school controls are Census region, urbanicity, log of the number of students, student-teacher ratio, percent white, and percent eligible for free-or reduced-price lunch. The district variable is the log of median household income (for 1999, based on data from 18 Approximately 21 percent of the sample is missing these scores. We include an indicator for missing scores and impute a score for these students using the average score.\nthe 2000 Census). The county variable is the log of population density (for 2010, based on data from the 2010 Census). The results, shown in Appendix Table A4 , indicate that the most important determinants of start times are Census region (schools in the Northeast start earlier), urbanicity (suburban schools start earlier), and the number of students (larger schools start earlier). The variation by urbanicity and school size is consistent with the notion that large suburban districts are more likely to have earlier start times in order to reduce transportation costs."}, {"section_title": "IV. Econometric Analyses", "text": "For the discrete outcomes (e.g., high school graduation), we estimate simple probit models of the following form:\nwhere the dependent variable, Y, is the academic outcome or intermediate outcome; S denotes school start time; D denotes the length of the school day; X is the vector of control variables; a0, a1, a2 and a3 are the coefficients to be estimated; and F(.) is the CDF of the standard normal distribution. The subscripts indicating observation and outcome are suppressed. Our estimated effect of start time on Y is the average marginal effect of S.\nFor continuous outcomes (e.g., college-entrance exam scores), we estimate linear models using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS):\nwhere Z represents the continuous outcome; b0, b1, b2 and b3 are the coefficients to be estimated;\nand u~N(0,1). Length of school day (D) is included as a control in (1) and (2) because we are interested in the effect of changing the school start time without changing the length of the school day. All regressions are weighted using the CDS child weights, and standard errors are adjusted for clustering by school."}, {"section_title": "19", "text": "In estimating these equations, we are interested in the causal effect of start time on achievement. Although bell times are exogenous to the student, it is possible that our estimated coefficient on start time (b1 in the linear models; or the average marginal effect of S in the probit models) does not represent that causal effect. In particular, it is possible that our estimates suffer from an omitted variables bias due to student sorting into schools with different starting times.\nAlthough our models include controls for a number of school characteristics, it could be that schools with earlier start times are better or worse than schools with later start times in ways that we do not capture in our controls.\nTables 3 and 4 present the average marginal effects from probit estimates of effects on long-run academic achievement. 20 The results indicate that delaying the school start time by one hour while holding school day length constant decreases the probability that female students graduate from high school by 8.5 percentage points. For male students, delaying the school start time by one hour decreases the probability that they attend a four-year college by 16.6\npercentage points and a selective four-year college by 10.2 percentage points (although the latter effect is not statistically significant at conventional levels).\nSchool day length does not have a statistically-significant effect on academic outcomes for female or male students. Consistent with other research suggesting that math ability is related to academic and labor-market outcomes (Joensen 2007; Aughinbaugh 2012) , the effect of 19 The CDS-II and CDS-III child weights account for attrition since the CDS1. We do not further account for attrition in the TA. 20 We estimate the female students' high school graduate probit without the mother's college degree indicator variable, because mother's college degree perfectly predicts high school graduation. For similar reasons, we estimate the college-entrance exam probits using the subsample of students who did not live in a state mandating an exam.\nthe W-J applied-problem score on the probability of each of the academic outcomes is positive for females and males (although it is not always statistically significant at conventional levels for males). The effect of living either with two parents or with a mother who has a college degree on academic outcomes is positive and in many instances statistically significant. 21 Among female students, we find that being black increases the probability of attending college by age 20. Among male students, we find that being Hispanic increases the probability of attending college by age 20 but decreases the probability of attending a selective four-year college. Being a free-or reduced-price lunch recipient reduces the probability of college attendance by age 20 by 7.2 percentage points for female students and 11.3 percentage points for male students. For female students, the probability of taking a college-entrance exam increases with the number of siblings. For male students, the probability of graduating from high school increases with the number of siblings.\nWe find that delaying the school start time by one hour has a large positive effect on the SAT score for female students (an effect that is 8.4 percent of the mean score), which is consistent with previous research on the effects of start times on exam performance; however, we find no effect on the other test scores examined (Table 5) . For male students, we do not find any statistically-significant effects of start times on test scores. For female students, the prior WJ-R applied-problem score has a positive effect on all test scores. This score also has a positive effect on high school WJ-R applied-problem scores and SAT scores for male students.\nThe prior WJ-R broad-reading score has a small positive effect on female students' high school WJ-R scores and the high school WJ-R broad-reading score and SAT scores of male students.\nIn Table 6 , we show the effects of school start times and school day length on both the timing and duration of sleep. 22 For female students, we find that in response to a delay in start time of one hour, they sleep 0.449 hours more per night. In response to a delay in start time by one hour, male students adjust their night sleep by 0.468 hours. Thus, the diary measures indicate that in response to a delay in start time of one hour, students get almost a half an hour of extra sleep each night. In addition, we find that male students sleep longer at night if they attend a longer school day. If we use the \"usual sleep\" measure, the effect of school start time on night sleep for both female and male students is smaller and not statistically significant at conventional levels.\nSimilar to previous research (Knutson and Lauderdale 2009; Wolfson et al. 2007 ), we find that both male and female students adjust their sleep schedules to a later start time by waking up over three quarters (0.796) of an hour and 0.634 of an hour later in the day, respectively. However, while female students go to bed at about the same time (regardless of their school start time), we find that male students will, on average, go to bed 19 minutes later in response to a delay in their start time of one hour. Broadly speaking, though, these effects on sleep are consistent with the notion that early school schedules are not in sync with adolescents' circadian rhythms.\nIn Table 7 , we show the effects of school start times and school day length on a variety of other intermediate outcomes, including sports participation, homework, screen time, time with parents, employment, and health outcomes. For female students, we find that they are more likely to belong to a sports team when schools start later, which is counter to the argument made by opponents of later school start times. However, there is no effect on the amount of time that they spend playing sports. We find no statistically significant effects of school start times on female students' other outcomes. For male high school students, we find that they spend less time watching TV or using the computer for non-homework purposes (screen time) when school starts later, which is consistent with Edwards' (2012) finding for middle school students. These results do not suggest that female students' other activities (i.e., activities other than sleep) can explain the positive relationship between school start times and SAT scores; in addition, the results in Table 7 cannot explain the estimated negative effect of start times on academic outcomes.\nIn addition, with later start times, male students are not any more or less likely to hold a job or spend time at work, which is counter to the argument made by opponents of later school start times. For male students, we find that an increase in school day length increases time spent on homework outside of school. For female and male students, we find that an increase in school day length decreases work time. For female students, we find that an increase in the school day length decreases the amount of time they spend on sports and their screen time. For males, an increase in the school day by an hour increases the probability of experiencing sadness during the last two weeks by 9.8 percentage points."}, {"section_title": "V. Discussion", "text": "Our results suggest that shifting to a later start time would have some negative effects on long-run academic achievement, although we do find a positive effect on female students' SAT scores. There are several potential explanations for later start times having no effect or a negative effect on achievement. One reason is statistical: Although we controlled for some school-level characteristics, our estimated effects of school start time may still be biased by a failure to adequately control for particular school-level characteristics that are correlated with achievement and school start times.\nTaking our results at face value, it is possible that later start times have no effect (or even a negative effect) on achievement even though later start times are associated with more sleep (Hinrichs 2010) . When schools start later, students get more sleep and as a result may learn more per unit of time; however, because they are awake for less time, they may learn less outside of school. Although students with early start times get less sleep on school nights, they may be able to make other lifestyle changes so that their achievement is not affected. For instance, they could increase their sleep on weekends; they could use caffeine to promote alertness for their morning classes; and they could receive extra support from their parents (or tutors) with their homework.\nAnother set of reasons for why we may observe a negative effect on achievement relates to how school-related inputs to education production are affected by start times. Although students may prefer later start times, teachers may prefer earlier start times; as a result, teachers may be less productive with later start times. With later starting times, schools face potential conflicts with after-school sports and other extracurricular activities. They may shift these activities to the morning (counteracting any effect of later start times for student athletes) or even dismiss students early on particular days, which would reduce instructional time."}, {"section_title": "VI. Conclusion", "text": "Using the nationally representative PSID-CDS, we find that when school starts an hour later, students sleep almost half an hour more on school nights. However, we do not find evidence that this increase in sleep translates into improved long-run academic outcomes, although SAT scores do improve among female students. To the contrary, results suggest that later school start times have large negative effects on the probability of graduating from high school for female students and the probability of four-year college attendance by age 20 for male students. We also investigated a number of other mechanisms (besides sleep) through which later school start times could affect academic achievement, but none of these effects can explain the relationships between school start times and academic achievement.\nIn future work on this subject, we will explore how increases in sleep time (from later school start times) affect students' allocation of time among other waking activities (besides school) that may have effects on student achievement, including alternative homework-time measures and weekend activities.
