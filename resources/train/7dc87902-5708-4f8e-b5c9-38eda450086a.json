[{"section_title": "", "text": "1 Under the revised rules beginning August 1, 2011, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs pays all tuition and fees for students attending an in-state public school and up to $17,500 annually for those attending a private or foreign institution (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs 2011c). If costs exceed that amount, military students may be able to receive additional funding through the Yellow Ribbon program, under which the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs matches the amount participating institutions elect to contribute toward students' remaining costs (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs 2011a). Statistics in Brief publications present descriptive data in tabular formats to provide useful information to a broad audience, including members of the general public. They address simple and topical issues and questions. They do not investigate more complex hypotheses, account for inter-relationships among variables, or support causal inferences. We encourage readers who are interested in more complex questions and in-depth analysis to explore other NCES resources, including publications, online data tools, and public-and restricted-use datasets. See nces.ed.gov and references noted in the body of this document for more information.  2 BPS:04/09 data were included in this report in order to present the reasons military and other students gave for selecting their postsecondary institution. NPSAS:08 data do not contain this information. BPS data represent only first-time beginning postsecondary students, whereas NPSAS data represent all undergraduates and graduate students enrolled. age and family responsibilities: nonmilitary undergraduates who were independent (classified for federal aid purposes as financially independent of their parents on the basis of age, marital status, and whether they had a dependent). 4 4 In 2007-08, 84 percent of all military undergraduates were age 24 or older and 62 percent were married and/or had at least one dependent. Similarly, 86 percent of nonmilitary independent undergraduates were age 24 or older and 67 percent were married and/or had one or more dependents. In contrast, by definition, none of the nonmilitary students classified as dependent had these characteristics (Radford and Wun 2009). For statistics on how military undergraduates compare with nonmilitary dependent undergraduates, see Radford and Wun (2009).  (Radford and Wun 2009). All comparisons of estimates were tested for statistical significance using the Student's t-statistic, and all differences cited are statistically significant at the p < .05 level. 5 From all statistically significant comparisons, this publication discusses a subset that may be of interest to a variety of readers. 6 Department of Education results cited here and throughout this report are based on students attending Title IV eligible institutions in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico."}, {"section_title": "KEY FINDINGS", "text": "How many military service members and veterans were enrolled in undergraduate and graduate education in 2007-08, and what percentage used GI Bill education benefits to pay for their education? 1     (figure 6). Military students were enrolled in private nonprofit 4-year institutions at a higher rate than their nonmilitary peers (13 percent vs. 9 percent) but significant differences between these two groups in the other types of institutions attended and presented in the figure were not detected. 9 Note that this difference appears not to be statistically significant based on the confidence intervals presented in Radford and Wun (2009), but this difference is statistically significant based on t -tests."}, {"section_title": "TYPE OF INSTITUTION", "text": "Percentage distributions of military and nonmilitary independent undergraduates, by type of institution attended: 2007-08 1 Other institutions include public less-than-2-year and private not-for-profit 2-year or less. NOTE: Students were considered to be military students if they were veterans or military service members on active duty or in the reserves. Because 97 percent of all military undergraduates but only 45 percent of all nonmilitary undergraduates were independent (classified for federal aid purposes as financially independent of their parents on the basis of age, marital status, and whether they had a dependent), military undergraduates were compared only with nonmilitary independent undergraduates. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding. Estimates are based on data from students enrolled in Title IV eligible postsecondary institutions in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, and students attending more than one institution.      $4,500 $3,200 $9,100 $8,100 $10,000 $11,000 $13,500 $10,200 Amount Military graduate students tended to wait longer to enroll in graduate school than nonmilitary graduate students. Eleven percent of military students matriculated less than a year after receiving a bachelor's degree, while 40 percent waited 7 or more years (figure 10).
