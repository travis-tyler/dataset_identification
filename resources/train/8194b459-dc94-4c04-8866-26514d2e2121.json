[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is a heterogeneous condition. Based on clinical symptoms, aMCI could be categorized into single-domain aMCI (SDaMCI, only memory deficit) and multi-domain aMCI (MD-aMCI, one or more cognitive domain deficit). As core intrinsic functional architecture, inter-hemispheric connectivity maintains many cognitive abilities. However, few studies investigated whether SD-aMCI and MD-aMCI have different inter-hemispheric connectivity pattern.\nWe evaluated inter-hemispheric connection pattern using fluorine-18 positron emission tomography -fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18 F PET-FDG), resting-state functional MRI and structural T1 in 49 controls, 32 SD-aMCI, and 32 MD-aMCI patients. Specifically, we analyzed the 18 F PET-FDG (intensity normalized by cerebellar vermis) in a voxel-wise manner. Then, we estimated inter-hemispheric functional and structural connectivity by calculating the voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) and corpus callosum (CC) subregions volume. Further, we correlated inter-hemispheric indices with the behavioral score and pathological biomarkers.\nResults: We found that MD-aMCI exhibited more several inter-hemispheric connectivity damages than SD-aMCI. Specifically, MD-aMCI displayed hypometabolism in the bilateral middle temporal gyrus (MTG), inferior parietal lobe, and left precuneus (PCu) (p < 0.001, corrected). Correspondingly, MD-aMCI showed decreased VMHC in MTG, PCu, calcarine gyrus, and postcentral gyrus, as well as smaller mid-posterior CC than the SD-aMCI and controls (p < 0.05, corrected). Contrary to MD-aMCI, there were no neuroimaging indices with significant differences between SD-aMCI and controls, except reduced hypometabolism in bilateral MTG. Within aMCI patients, hypometabolism and reduced inter-hemispheric connectivity correlated with worse executive ability. Moreover, hypometabolism indices correlated to increased amyloid deposition. Conclusion: In conclusion, patients with MD-aMCI exhibited the more severe deficit in inter-hemispheric communication than SD-aMCI. This long-range connectivity deficit may contribute to cognitive profiles and potentially serve as a biomarker to estimate disease progression of aMCI patients."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) represents an intermediate stage between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Petersen et al., 2014) . According to impaired cognitive domains number, aMCI patients could be further categorized into two subtypes: single-domain aMCI (SD-aMCI), characterized by relatively selective memory impairment and the multi-domain aMCI (MD-aMCI), indicating extensive deficits involving at least one other domain (Winblad et al., 2004; Busse et al., 2006) . Previous epidemiology study shows that MD-aMCI has a higher risk of clinical progression than the SD-aMCI (Golob et al., 2007) . Therefore, to investigate the mechanism underlying these aMCI subtypes may efficiently facilitate clinical early intervention and management. Recently, neuroimaging studies pointed out that the MD-aMCI displays more diffuse gray matter atrophy (Haller et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2012) and lower brain activity than the SD-aMCI, mainly involving default mode network (DMN) and frontoparietal regions (Li et al., 2014) . Despite these studies shedding light into the aMCI pathological mechanism to some extent, it remains unclear whether SD-aMCI and MD-aMCI have different inter-hemispheric connection pattern.\nCompared to the other neuroimaging indices, insufficient attention paid to the direct inter-hemispheric connectivity of aMCI patients. Anatomically, the connectivity between hemispheres is a core mode of the brain intrinsic functional architecture. Moreover, this bi-hemispheric communication procedure substantially affects many cognitive domains, including executive and memory functions (Salvador et al., 2008; Stark et al., 2008; Saar-Ashkenazy et al., 2016) . Until now, only two functional MRI studies directly explored the interhemispheric functional connectivity in aMCI patients. However, two studies drew the entirely different conclusion. Specifically, Wang et al. (2015) demonstrated that MCI patients exhibited an enhanced inter-hemispheric functional connectivity in the sensorimotor cortex to resist the cognitive decline; however, another work reported the negative result between aMCI and controls . Given that aMCI is a heterogeneous condition, we thus hypothesized that this inconsistency might attribute to the different damage pattern of inter-hemispheric connectivity between SD-aMCI and MD-aMCI patients.\nNotably, some previous findings focusing on corpus callosum (CC) supported this hypothesis. Anatomically, CC acts as the most robust commissural white matter bundle to maintain the functional connectivity between the hemispheres (Roland et al., 2017) . Specifically, some studies demonstrated that the AD and MCI patients exhibit the CC shape change, atrophy, and impaired diffusivity indices impairment, especially in the posterior part (Janowsky et al., 1996; Di Paola et al., 2010; Ardekani et al., 2014; Rasero et al., 2017) . Subsequently, some studies further demonstrated patients with MD-aMCI, but not SD-aMCI, have reduced mean diffusivity (MD) in the whole CC compared to controls; moreover, decrease of MD in the CC body is associated with decreased general cognition and executive ability (Li et al., 2013) . On the other hand, as a valid diagnostic biomarker in dementia studies, fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18 F FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) research also shows more diffuse hypometabolism in MD-aMCI than the SDaMCI. Interestingly, these hypometabolism regions are mostly located in the bilateral homotopic precuneus (PCu) and the temporoparietal cortex (Caffarra et al., 2008; Cerami et al., 2015) . Considering the evidence of CC degeneration and bilateral homotopic hypometabolism, we inferred that different interhemispheric connectivity damage pattern might exist between aMCI subgroups.\nTo test this hypothesis, we analyzed the structural T1 image, resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI), 18 F PET-FDG, neuropsychological scales, and pathological biomarkers in a relatively large aMCI sample from ADNI database. Firstly, we analyzed inter-hemispheric homotopic functional connectivity by using a voxel-wise method, namely voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) (Zuo et al., 2010; Luo et al., 2018b) . The potential inter-hemispheric structural connectivity was evaluated by estimating CC volume. We divided CC into five part due to its different anatomical connection [i.e., genus connects the frontal areas, while body and splenium part connects the temporal and parietal areas (Fischl, 2012) ]. Moreover, to test whether regions with inter-hemispheric disruption accompanied by metabolic abnormalities, we also analyzed 18 F FDG-PET data in a voxelwise manner. Additionally, we also correlated neuroimaging indices with cognition and pathological biomarkers (reflecting by CSF and amyloid imaging). Our study aims to (i) compare the alteration of the inter-hemispheric connectivity and the metabolism between aMCI subtypes; (ii) explore the possible interactions between different neuroimaging modalities; and (iii) explore the relationships between neuroimaging indices and cognition."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative", "text": "Data used in this study were obtained from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database 1 .

After preprocessing, we obtained each subject's 4D residual functional volume in native functional space. These 4D data were registered to the MNI152 space with 2 mm resolution (affine transformation). Due to the dispute of removing the global signal, we omit to regress out the global signal.

However, except hypometabolism in bilateral MTG, no other differences existed between SD-aMCI and NC. Subsequently, the correlation analyses showed that these neuroimaging indices related to executive function across aMCI patients. Moreover, hypometabolism indices related to increased amyloid deposition. In summary, compared to SD-aMCI, the MD-aMCI exhibited the more severe deficit in inter-hemispheric communication. This long-range connectivity deficit may further contribute to cognitive abilities deficits and potentially serve as a biomarker to monitor the disease progression in aMCI patients. Firstly, our findings suggested that both aMCI patients displayed hypometabolism in bilateral MTG, which is a region involving memory-related network (Ward et al., 2014; MunozLopez et al., 2015) . These deficits thus may contribute to the memory deficit in these patients. However, only the MDaMCI simultaneously displayed inter-hemispheric functional connectivity decrease in MTG, supporting the notion that the MD-aMCI is a more advanced disease form than the SD-aMCI. Notably, one study pointed out that SD-aMCI displayed decreased regional activity in right MTG relative to NC (Luo et al., 2018a) . Accordingly, we speculated that the intact inter-hemispheric connectivity in SD-aMCI might compensate its unilateral MTL impairment to some extent. Our neuropsychological results could support this interpretation, showing that MD-aMCI exhibited worse memory performance than SD-aMCI. Besides, other support evidence comes result from 18 F-florbetapir PET indicating that only the MD-aMCI has increased amyloid deposition than NC. Meanwhile, our findings validated previous studies, which reported that only MD-aMCI patients have cortical thinning, gray matter atrophy, and white matter tract deficit in MTG regions (Seo et al., 2007; Whitwell et al., 2007) .\nMany evidence suggests that amyloid accumulation preferentially starts in PCu, especially in the left side (Janke et al., 2001; Braak et al., 2006; Palmqvist et al., 2017) . As expected, our results showed the MD-aMCI, but not the SD-aMCI, exhibited hypometabolism (left side) and reduced inter-hemispheric functional connection in PCu regions simultaneously. Moreover, we found that the reduced PCu inter-hemispheric functional connection associated with the worse executive function across aMCI patients. This relationship agrees with clinical manifestation in MD-aMCI patients, manifested by more than one cognitive domain impairment. Meanwhile, previous work also documented that MD-aMCI displayed impaired microstructure in PCu (Li et al., 2013) . Specifically, by utilizing rsfMRI, one study demonstrated that the MD-aMCI exhibited lower regional activity in PCu than the SD-aMCI and NC. Coincidentally, their work also found that reduced PCu activity was related to worse executive ability (Li et al., 2014) . As a central role in the primary executive networks, studies of the AD and MCI frequently reported that regional PCu deficit associated with the decreased executive ability (Sridharan et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2013; Luo et al., 2017a,b) . Furthermore, we found that left PCu hypometabolism was related to amyloid deposition. Consequently, we speculated that amyloid-related neurotoxicity in unilateral PCu region might lead to the inter-hemispheric connectivity damage in corresponding areas.\nRegarding the parietal cortex, the MD-aMCI exhibited hypometabolism in bilateral IPL and reduced inter-hemispheric PCG functional connectivity; additionally, we found that IPL hypometabolism was related to increased amyloid deposition. Therefore, we again interpreted that the hypometabolism in bilateral IPL may attribute to synaptic dysfunction caused by amyloid (Palop and Mucke, 2010; T\u00f6nnies and Trushina, 2017) . Moreover, we observed that parietal cortex hypometabolism and inter-hemispheric dysfunction associated with worse executive ability. This relationship could attribute to the reason that both the IPL and PCG have extensive connections with the frontal region (i.e., frontoparietal circuit). Functionally, this circuit could send rich sensory information for processing speed and affect executive ability (Sullivan et al., 2001; Buckner et al., 2008; Luo et al., 2017b) . Furthermore, some structural MRI studies support our results. One VBM study pointed out that patients with MDaMCI exhibited GM reduction and increased mean diffusion in PCG (Li et al., 2013) . Meanwhile, using diffusion spectrum Regarding VMHC results, the ANCOVA was used to explore differential brain regions among groups [controlling for age, education level, and gender, p < 0.05 at height and p < 0.05 at the cluster level, Gaussian random field (GRF) corrected].\nRegarding the FDG-PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) image, the ANCOVA was used to explore differential brain regions among the three groups (controlling for age, education level, and gender, p < 0.001 at height and p < 0.05 at cluster level, GRF corrected). The X, Y, and Z coordinates of the primary peak locations in the MNI space. MD-aMCI, multiple-domain amnestic mild cognitive impairment; SD-aMCI, single-domain amnestic mild cognitive impairment; MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute.\nimaging (DSI), Chang et al. (2015) highlighted that the MDaMCI groups have more impairment in the inferior cingulum bundle than the SD-aMCI groups, which anatomically connected with the parietal cortex. Interestingly, MD-aMCI patients displayed reduced interhemispheric RSFC in CG, which is part of the extra-striate visual network and involved with the perception created by visual stimuli. Similarly, one rsfMRI study also illustrated that the MDaMCI displayed decreased brain activity here (Li et al., 2014) . On the other hand, most previous aMCI studies (without dividing into SD-aMCI and MD-aMCI) concluded that aMCI patients displayed increased intrinsic activity in CG (Han et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2012; Lou et al., 2016) . This inconsistency may attribute to the aMCI heterogeneity. Besides, we found that decreased inter-hemispheric functional connectivity between bilateral CG was related to worse executive ability. Conceptually, the reaction time includes not only visual processing but also the time required for response execution (Thorpe et al., 1996) . Moreover, optical encoding impairment could contribute to the reduction of processing speed (Br\u00e9bion et al., 2015) . Consequently, we interpreted this correlation as that the MD-aMCI patients were difficult to receive the information flows from visual sensors, further, exerting a negative influence on executive ability.\nAs the dominant white matter pathways, the CC links cortical hubs of the left and right hemispheres together. Here, we observed that MD-aMCI exhibited a smaller midposterior CC volume than the SD-aMCI and NC. Moreover, we found the selective mid-posterior CC degeneration in MD-aMCI corresponded well with the fMRI results discussed above. Specifically, regression analysis results showed that midposterior CC was significantly related to VMHC results, involving the bilateral MTG, PCu, CG, and PCG. In accord with our results, anatomical evidence showed that the bilateral MTG and PCu are strongly connected through the posterior CC (Cavanna and Trimble, 2006; van der Knaap and van der Ham, 2011; Wang et al., 2014) . Additionally, we noted that smaller mid-posterior CC volume was related to worse executive function. This relationship suggests that CC degeneration might contribute to or even accelerate cognitive deficit (Agosta et al., 2015; Farrar et al., 2017; Luo et al., 2017b) . Combined with the results of bilateral hypometabolism and interhemispheric disconnection, we hypothesized that mid-posterior CC atrophy may reflect the Wallerian degeneration secondary to neuronal loss caused by amyloid deposition (Bozzali et al., 2002) .\nWithout the histological data, it was difficult to describe the exact mechanism underlying inter-hemispheric connectivity deficits in MD-aMCI patients. There are two reasons that may interpret the possible mechanism. Firstly, these deficits may result from the amyloid-related pathological process. Specifically, we found that the between-group difference results of PET-FDG and VMHC overlapped well, including the bilateral MTG, PCu, IPL, and PCG regions. Further, within these overlapping regions, the level of hypometabolism was significantly related to inter-hemispheric decrease. Nevertheless, only the metabolism indices were related to amyloid deposition. We, therefore, speculated that accumulated amyloid plaques in MD-aMCI patients might lead to synapse loss and hypometabolism, further, result in functional connectivity disruption with its contralateral regions (T\u00f6nnies and Trushina, 2017) . Second, decreased inter-hemispheric functional connectivity may also result from the widespread white matter integrity disruption (White et al., 2009; Luo et al., 2016) . Conclusively, these interpretations should be taken with caution due to the lack of animal study and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) method, respectively.\nSome limitations existed in our study. First, this cross-sectional study was failed to assess the long-term effects of hypometabolism and inter-hemispheric disconnection in the subsequent disease progression. Therefore, longitudinal studies are needed to explore the inter-hemispheric connection pattern following AD continuum, from healthy aging to clinical stages. Second, in accord with the inter-hemispheric functional connectivity results, correspondingly, MD-aMCI patients demonstrated selective mid-posterior CC degeneration. However, CC volume only identified the main inter-hemispheric connective tracts, rather than illustrating the precise definition of \"inter-hemispheric structural connection.\" Therefore, future DTI studies by using tractography or network analysis are needed to provide more detailed information about inter-hemispheric white matter pathways in aMCI patients (Cavanna and Trimble, 2006; Rasero et al., 2017; Tucholka et al., 2018 ). In the current study, based on the ADNI 2 database, we noticed that subjects do not have both the DTI and the rsfMRI FIGURE 2 | Upper: brain areas with the significant difference of voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) among normal control (NC), single-domain aMCI (SD-aMCI), and multi-domain aMCI (MD-aMCI), by controlling for age, education level, and gender.

Finally, future studies with larger sample sizes are urgently required."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "By using multi-modal neuroimaging methods, this study initially explored the mechanism underlying inter-hemispheric connection pattern in SD-aMCI and MD-aMCI patients. Firstly, our results support the notion that aMCI is heterogeneous. Specifically, MD-aMCI displayed more severe inter-hemispheric communication impairment while the SD-aMCI relatively preserved it. Moreover, our results demonstrate that different inter-hemispheric connectivity damage pattern contributes to distinct clinical symptoms in these two aMCI subtypes. Finally, our study shows that inter-hemispheric connectivity may serve as a potential biomarker to monitor disease progression in aMCI patients. a Post hoc paired comparisons showed significant group differences between NC and SD-aMCI, after Bonferroni correction (p < 0.05). b Post hoc paired comparisons showed significant group differences between NC and MD-aMCI, after Bonferroni correction (p < 0.05). c Post hoc paired comparisons showed significant group differences between SD-aMCI and MD-aMCI, after Bonferroni correction (p < 0.05). * Post hoc paired comparisons showed significant group differences between NC and MD-aMCI as well as SD-aMCI and MD-aMCI, corrected by the LSD (p < 0.05).
