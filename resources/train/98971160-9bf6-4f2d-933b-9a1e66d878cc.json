[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "A document is a thematic body of text containing a semantic structure of words. The theme of a document, also called as the primary topic, is constituted by a specific proportion of various words.\nConsidering existence of a finite vocabulary, different proportions of words (and their semantic similarity) in each document would drive the theme(s) or topic(s) of various documents. Therefore, while words are apparent constituents of a document, topics are latent (or hidden). Topic modeling, a statistical method, employs these characteristics of documents to discover hidden structures (or latent topics) 1 . Its utility in text-mining and document retrieval/classification tasks in various fields of scientific research is rather well known [2] [3] [4] . In fact, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), an unsupervised machine learning approach, is particularly known for identifying latent topics in large document collections and deciphering the words that define the inferred topics using a generative statistical model. LDA assumes that a document is generated by a distribution of all possible hidden topics, while a topic is generated by the distribution of all possible apparent words. This multiplicity of topic affiliation for documents and words is accommodated through assumption of Dirichlet priors which can be optimized to get ideal distribution of coherent topics in a document 1 . The approach can also be made akin to Markov-chains for probing the temporal evolution of a large number of documents and document topics 4 .\nA large number of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences are being deposited to public repositories like GISAID 6 through an unprecedented spirit of scientific collaboration across the world. The high volume of raw data is expected to balloon further by the end of this pandemic.\nEach new sequenced genome is a mutant/variant (with few exceptions) of original reference genome i.e. Wuhan/WIV04/2019 (EPI_ISL_402124). In other words, certain mutations at nucleotide and amino acid levels can be expected to be observed in the submitted genomes.\nUnderstanding the evolution and diversity of these variants has been a subject of interest to a wide spectrum of researchers. Various reports aimed at identification of clades or classification system(s) for these genomes have in fact been outcomes of the afore-mentioned problem statement 7 .\nAlthough conventional topic modeling has been utilized to understand Covid-19 from literature data 5 , can it be applied to obtain additional insights from sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes and to rather classify them? In other words, can we perceive each genome of SARS-CoV-2 as a document containing words in the form of characteristic mutations (Figure 1 Consequently, a genome would essentially become a bag of mutations (like bag of words in a document). Such an assumption can potentially enable classification of the entire genome corpus by identifying mutation signatures (equivalent to topics in document) through topic modeling.\nMoreover, given the inherent temporal nature of genome collections, dynamic topic modeling (e.g. temporal LDA or Hidden Markov Model driven LDA) may rather provide a way to probe the evolution of the genome variants in terms of identified mutation signatures 4, 8 . A parallel between classical LDA on a large document corpus and a genome corpus is illustrated in plate notation below.\nwhere, \u03b1 is a parameter governing the distribution structure of signatures (nucleotide and amino acid mutations) across all genomes (similar to topics across all documents) \u03b8 is a random matrix representing Dirichlet distribution of various signatures in the genomes (similar to topics in documents), such that \u03b8(i,j) indicate the probability of the i th genome (document) to contain mutations (words) pertaining to the j th signature (topic) \u03b2 is a parameter governing the distribution structure of mutations across all signatures (similar to words across all topics) \u03b7 is a random matrix representing Dirichlet distribution of various mutations in signatures (similar to words in topics), such that \u03b7 (i,j) indicate the probability of the i th signature (topic) to contain the j th mutation 2) For each genome (document) g, first draw \u03b8g Dirichlet(\u03b1), then for each \u223c n th mutation (word) of the\nTo substantiate the conjecture, a bag of mutations data structure for ~47000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes submitted to GISAID was created. Classical LDA was employed to generate topic models leading to identification of 16 amino acid mutation signatures and 18 nucleotide mutation signatures (equivalent to topics) in the corpus of chosen genomes through rigorous hyper-parameter tuning for coherence optimization (Figure 2) . Interestingly, most of the high weight inferred signatures had a good overlap with the previously identified clades specific to various geographical regions (refer Table 1 ). For example, the signature-11, constituted predominantly by amino acid mutations N-P13L/ORF9b-P10S, ORF1a-L3606F, ORF1b-A88V, ORF1a-T2016K, was observed to dominate in India and other Asian regions 9 . Biology agnostic, data structure driven approaches for SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences may therefore have some merit in not only handling the large amount of genomic data, but also for identifying mutation signatures (and hence classifying genomes) that might be of interest to clinicians/ biologists 10 . Their cross validation against phylogenetic estimations can help fine tune the performance of these machine learning algorithms, thereby adding confidence to the use of unconventional methods for probing genomic diversity 7 .

NextStrain's Augur pipeline was employed with default parameters to align the sequences against the reference Wuhan/WIV04/2019 (EPI_ISL_402124) 11 . Individual proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were extracted post alignment and translated to the amino acid sequences. Comparisons to reference amino acid and nucleotide sequences were performed to profile mutations for all viral genome sequences. A genome collection (document corpus) mapped to the identified nucleotide and amino acid substitution mutations (document vocabulary) was created. Sample mutation profile data structure have been provided in Supplementary Table 1 . It may be noted that only those genomes were employed for topic modelling which contained at least one amino acid mutation."}, {"section_title": "Bag of mutations", "text": "As shown in Figure 1 , bag of words representation of a document in natural language processing pertains to two aspects of the document: Table 1 ). Two corpus vocabularies were consequently created (one each for nucleotide and amino acid mutations). Binary document vectors were prepared for each of the genomes against the corpus vocabularies for these two types of mutations. Mutation-genome matrices so computed for the two corpora represented the global picture of 'bag of words' models for novel corona virus genomes. It may be noted that unlike a conventional natural language processing task, given the non-linguistic context of observed mutations, the issues pertaining to tokenization, stop words, lemmatization and stemming were not relevant here 1 ."}, {"section_title": "Bag of mutation bi-grams", "text": "Given that most of the existing clade definitions employ two or more co-occurring mutations, a bigram nucleotide mutation model was also created for the genomes. The corpus vocabulary for bigrams was created by taking into account the observed co-occurring pairs of mutations in the entire corpus of nucleotide mutation vocabulary (and not all possible pairs of mutations), such that each genome was represented by a numerically sorted list of nucleotide mutations. It is pertinent to note that numeric sorting of mutations is critical in searching for bi-grams (or n-grams) for a meaningful contextual search. It may be noted that the choice of bi-gram mutations is enabled by a probabilistic scoring procedure 12 as follows: "}, {"section_title": "N-gram mutation signatures", "text": "The probabilistic derivation of bi-grams paves the way for an initial estimation of signatures of any size in the corpus using the following progressive probabilistic scoring: score ( (n\u22121) 1 , m 2 ) = count ( ( n\u22121) 1 , m 2 ) \u2212min ( (n\u22121) 1 , m 2 ) count ((n\u22121) 1 ) * count ( m 2 ) * Um where:\n(n-1) 1 , m 2 are mutations in a pair, such that (n-1) refers to the (n-1) sized mutation combination\nUm is total unique mutations (i.e. size of mutation vocabulary) score refers to the confidence score for the given pair count refers to the total occurrence in the corpus min refers to the minimum occurrence threshold for the mutation(s) in the corpus"}, {"section_title": "Topic (mutation signatures) modeling through Latent Dirichlet Allocation and hyperparameter tuning", "text": "Python's Gensim library was employed to estimate topic (mutation signature) models for ~47000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes through online variational Bayes (VB) algorithm as described previously 13, 14 . Quality of mutation signatures (topics) inferred by LDA was assessed using a coherence score which refers to an index of the semantic similarity between dominant mutations (words) of the mutation signature (topic). In other words, a mutation signature (topic) with high coherence is expected to have mutations (words) with high co-occurrence similarity score. A good overall mutation signature extraction is therefore expected to have a high mean coherence. The coherence measure was calculated for different numbers of mutation signature extractions between 2-30 and an optimal score for nucleotide as well as amino acid mutations were obtained. Further hyperparameter optimization was performed for a range of alpha and beta measures (between 0.001 -0.1, step size of 0.009) and the number of topics, in order to maximize the coherence score, and optimal values for all three parameters were obtained using the grid-search alogrithm 15 ."}, {"section_title": "Implementation", "text": "The entire implementation was executed in a 20 core Xeon 51 series 2.4GHz machine with 64GB RAM in a Python v3.7.6 kernel with Gensim v3.8.3 and Scikit-learn v0.23.1 for topic modelling using LDA."}, {"section_title": "Word clouds of the corpus-wide bag of mutations", "text": "Word clouds provide quick visual reference to the dominant words in a bag of words.

As a qualitative crosschecking, the dominating mutation composition of signatures inferred using LDA was compared with the well known recurrent mutation reports and clade definitions. Table 1 provides a summary of the amino acid mutation signatures detected through LDA and corresponding close literature evidence citing a similar phylogenetically estimated genome group/clade (if any). The mutations in the signature were ordered in according to the probability of their presence in the signature.\nConsequently, each signature was dominated by the first mutation, as compared to the probability of occurrence of other mutations in the signature. Also, it is pertinent to note that given the probabilistic nature of inference, a high total score (weight) is more likely to indicate co-occurring mutations across large number of genomes. First five mutations, in the order of their probability of occurrence in the signatures, have been listed in Table 1 . In addition, the bi-grams and tri-grams identified through probablistic approach in this study have already been supported with their score and prevalence across genomes (Supplementary Table 2 and 3).

In fact, an evolutionary trail may also be established by following a temporal approach to LDA (or other methods of topic modeling). An increase in efficiency of signature detection may further be achieved through other topic modeling methods (e.g. short text topic modeling). Importantly, insights obtained about latent signatures through machine learning approaches like LDA can also guide phylogenetic estimations.\nThis article is intended to encourage the use of unconventional data driven approaches as an avenue that deserves attention of both data scientists and biologists alike. This, we believe, is expected to supplement the efforts in understanding the genomic diversity of the evolving SARS-CoV-2 genomes (and other pathogens). "}]
