[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract: The increasing rate of sea level rise (SLR) poses a major threat to coastal lands and natural resources, especially affecting natural preserves and protected areas along the coast. These impacts are likely to exacerbate when combined with storm surges. It is also expected that SLR will cause spatial reduction and migration of coastal wetland and marsh ecosystems, which are common in the natural preserves. This study evaluates the potential impacts of SLR and marsh migration on the hydrodynamics and waves conditions inside natural protected areas during storm surge. The study focused on four protected areas located in different areas of the Chesapeake Bay representing different hydrodynamic regimes. Historical and synthetic storms are simulated using a coupled storm surge (ADCIRC) and wave (SWAN) model for the Bay region for current condition and future scenarios. The future scenarios include different rates of local SLR projections (0.48 m, 0.97 m, 1.68 m, and 2.31 m) and potential land use changes due to SLR driven marsh migration, which is discretized in the selected preserve areas in a coarse scale. The results showed a linear increase of maximum water depth with respect to SLR inside the protected areas. However, the inundation extent, the maximum wave heights, and the current velocities inside the coastal protected areas showed a non-linear relationship with SLR, indicating that the combined impacts of storm surge, SLR, and marsh migration depend on multiple factors such as storm track, intensity, local topography, and locations of coastal protected areas. Furthermore, the impacts of SLR were significantly greater after a 1 m threshold of rise, suggesting the presence of a critical limit for conservation strategies."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Both ocean water level records and satellite altimetry from the last century indicate a rise in global sea level [1] [2] [3] [4] . In the next century sea level is expected to rise at a greater rate than during the past 50 years [5] . The Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projected that from 1986-2005 to 2081-2100, the global mean sea level will rise by 0.26-0.55 m and by 0.45-0.82 m respectively, under the lowest (RCP2.6) and highest greenhouse-gas concentration scenarios (RCP8.5) [1] . The potential rise in sea level can largely affect coastal ecosystems through increased flooding, salinity, erosion, and loss of wetlands [6] . Although the loss of coastal wetlands can occur from various reasons [7] , studies suggests that sea level rise (SLR) can reduce 22% of the world's coastal wetlands by the 2080s [8, 9] . It is also estimated that 66% of coastal wetlands in 76 developing countries are at risk considering 1 m of SLR in the future [7] .

The Bay is surrounded by the coastal counties of Maryland (MD) and Virginia (VA), which has been identified as one of the \"hot spot\" coasts for SLR [43] . In addition, the bay areas are experiencing a higher rate of land subsidence than the accretion rate (Boon, 2010). The lower accretion rate in the Bay areas can exacerbate the impacts for wetlands and marshes that are located in the low-lying coastal landscape. A study by Beckett et al. [44] used surface elevation and accretion measurements in freshwater and brackish marshes in the Nanticoke estuary of the Chesapeake Bay and demonstrated that, on average, the wetland elevation has decreased by 1.8 \u00b1 2.7 mmyr \u22121 , which is at least 5 mmyr \u22121 below the rate at which global sea level is rising. Recent studies also suggest that due to SLR, Virginia can lose about 50% to 80% of its wetlands [45] . Additionally, a 0.92 m (3 ft.) rise in sea level can affect about 25.2% of the protected areas in Virginia and 24.3% in Maryland [32] . For this study, four protected areas in the Chesapeake Bay were selected due to their different exposure to the tides and surge along the Bay. Figure 1 shows the locations of the sites in the Bay and representative photographs collected during the study. The preserve areas are the Dameron Marsh Natural Area Preserve (DM), the Eastern Shore National Wildlife Refuge (ES), the Magothy Bay Natural Area Preserve (MGB), and the Monie Bay National Estuarine Research reserve (MB). Each site contains different types of wetlands and marshes presenting specific characteristics and increasing the research interest on these sites. For instance, Dameron Marsh is affected by an unbalanced sediment transport problem, highly eroding the north part and building up the southern portions. Eastern Shore and Magothy Bay are located at the southern portion of the Delmarva Peninsula and are highly exposed to storm surge. Monie Bay is the only site located at the mid-eastern side of the Bay, and additionally, it is used for numerous research projects on marsh ecology. It should be noted that terms such as \"protected areas,\" \"preserve areas,\" or \"reserve areas\" are interchangeably used in the literature referring to natural preserve areas. In this study, the term \"preserve area\" refers to each selected site, whereas \"protected areas\" is used to denote protected areas in general.\nThe selected preserve areas present the typical characteristics of tidal marshes in temperate regions, mainly composed of Spartina alterniflora in the lower marsh and Spartina patens in the upper marsh [46] .

This provides the opportunity to examine the impacts on storm-induced waves, currents, and water levels by a marsh with vegetation typical for the Mid-Atlantic region. The mean elevation of these lands varied with their locations along the Chesapeake Bay. Preserve areas located at the mouth of the Bay (Eastern Shore and Magothy Bay) have relatively lower elevation than the other two sites, which are located near the middle of the Bay. The total area, location, mean elevation, and types of vegetation in each preserve area are summarized in Table 1 . "}, {"section_title": "Sea Level Rise in the Study Areas", "text": "In order to incorporate SLR in future scenarios, local SLR projections [42] for the Chesapeake Bay are used in this study. The local projections are derived from the synthesis and recommendations from National Climate Assessment (NCA) [41] . Based on global and regional assessment of past SLR trend and future IPCC emission scenarios, NCA prepared four possible SLR projections for managing the coastal resources in the US. Depending on different rates of SLR and ice sheet loss, these projections are considered as the lowest (or historic), low, high, and highest. Considering a constant regional subsidence rate of 2.7 mm/year, Mitchell et al. [42] derived four local SLR projections consistent to the national assessment. Due to low regional subsidence rate and higher rate of local SLR, the study [42] anticipated that subsidence rate for the region will be relatively constant [42] . Although this implies uncertainty in potential land use changes due to SLR, in order to capture a range of SLR and marsh migration impacts, we applied all four local projections in our study. The projected end of the century SLR values used in the study are provided in Table 2 . "}, {"section_title": "Marsh Migration-Potential Land Cover Changes", "text": "The potential land use changes due to SLR driven marsh migration are collected from the NOAA SLR Viewer tool [47] . The tool estimates potential spatial reduction and migration of coastal wetlands and marshes through a \"modified bathtub\" approach that includes local and regional tidal range, tidal level and salinity [47] . The basic assumption is, with an increase in sea level, some marshes will move into the adjacent low-lying areas. Meanwhile, marshes unable to maintain their elevation relative to sea level will slowly submerge into open water or convert to an intertidal mudflat [20] . It also considers that, based on the varying frequency, salinity, and time of inundation, certain types of vegetation can exist and particular types of wetland will sustain within an established tidal range [48] . The projections allow wetlands and marshes to migrate into other vegetated canopies such as forested or agricultural lands. It should be noted that coastal physical processes such as erosion, subsidence, or ecological and geomorphologic changes are not included in the NOAA marsh migration projections, which oversimplify the complex processes and can impose uncertainty in their prediction. Although previous studies [49, 50] have projected local scale distribution of marshes due to SLR using eco-geomorphologic models, there are trade-offs between acquiring fine scale marsh migration projection and simulating marsh evolution [51, 52] . Therefore, this study utilized the NOAA projected marsh migration data for including the best publicly available regional scale coastal land use projection due to SLR induced marsh migration and reduction in a large-scale geographic region.\nAlso, note that the tool provides marsh migration projections from 0.31 m (1 ft.) to 1.83 m (6 ft.) of SLR with an increment of 0.3 m (1 ft.) of SLR. Therefore, to prepare future scenarios that integrates SLR projections with potential marsh migration, each SLR projection is combined with the closest SLR driven marsh migration projection. For example, in the end century \"low\" scenario, the projected rise in sea level is 0.96 m (3.2 ft.), while in the NOAA tool the land use change projection due to closet SLR value is available for 0.92 m (3 ft.). Thus, for modeling the \"low\" scenario, a 0.96 m of SLR is added in the model while the respective land use scenario is incorporated from a 0.92 m (3 ft.) SLR induced marsh migration projection. In Table 2 , the correlation between each local SLR projections and nearest marsh movement or reduction scenario is outlined for the readers.\nAdditionally, Figure 2 demonstrates the projected land cover changes in the selected preserve areas due to marsh migration. The third column in Figure 2 shows the current land cover in the protected areas while the fourth and fifth columns show the projected land cover changes due to the \"low\" and \"highest\" SLR scenarios. It can be seen from the last two columns that with SLR, the existing salt-water marshes in the protected areas will either submerge into open water or convert to unconsolidated shore. For example, the second row on Figure 2 displays that with a 1.83 m (6 ft.) of SLR, the existing saltwater marshes in Dameron Marsh will submerge in the open water, while the freshwater wetlands can convert to brackish or transitional marshes. The current land use and land cover information is collected from NOAA's Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) [53] . The details of different land cover types can also be found from the C-CAP database."}, {"section_title": "Modeling Storm Surge and Waves", "text": "The coupled version of the hydrodynamic model, ADCIRC [38, 39] and wind wave model, SWAN [54] , was applied to simulate the impacts of storm surge and SLR in the coastal lands. ADCIRC is a numerical model that computes depth-averaged water levels through the Generalized Wave Continuity Equation (GWCE) and currents through vertically integrated momentum equations [55] . SWAN [54] is a third-generation wave model for estimating wave parameters based on the wave action balance equation. The coupled version of ADCIRC+SWAN simulates the interaction of wind waves and circulation on the same numerical mesh and thus shares the same model boundary. ADCIRC computes the water levels, currents, and wind speeds at each time step and passes it to SWAN. The information is used in SWAN to calculate the wave parameters and wave radiation stress gradients which are further applied to force ADCIRC in the next time step [55, 56] . Further details about the coupling processes can be found in [55, 56] . In this study, the FEMA Region III Mesh (R3) [57] is used to simulate storm surge in the Chesapeake Bay regions. The R3 Mesh was developed and validated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers [58, 59] . It is composed of 1.8 million nodes and has a minimum resolution of 14 m in the Bay regions. The mesh is designed to study the storm surge impacts on the FEMA Region III areas, such as Washington DC, Maryland, Virginia, and thus, it has finer resolution in the Chesapeake Bay areas. The model domain extends from 60 \u2022 W in the Atlantic Ocean to the 15 m contour line in the Mid-Atlantic coastal regions of the US. Figure 3 shows the model domain with selected storm tracks. The open ocean boundary of the model is forced by harmonic tides extracted from the Le Provost tidal database [60] . Based on track locations and intensity three storms are selected to simulate the impacts of storm surge in coastal protected areas in the Chesapeake Bay. One recent historical storm, Irene (2011), and two synthetic storms (#35 and #145) developed under the North Atlantic Coast Comprehensive Study (NACCS) [61] are selected for this study. Based on statistical analysis of meteorological data and past historical storms tracks in the Mid-Atlantic region, NACCS generated symmetric synthetic storms for the Chesapeake Bay region [61] . The Synthetic145 storm travels parallel to the west side of the Bay, while the Synthetic35 cyclone travels through the Bay, crossing its main axis (Figure 3) . Additionally, Hurricane Irene travels to the east of the Bay. In terms of storm intensity and forward speed, the selected storms represent a low to high strength hurricanes, including one of the major historical hurricanes, Irene that impacted the study area. Table 3 provides the minimum central pressure, maximum sustained wind speed and forward speed of the selected storms.\nThe storm parameters for Irene are collected from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) Hurricane Data 2nd generation (HURDAT2) database. To compute the meteorological forcing due to Hurricane Irene, ADCIRC uses the asymmetric vortex formulation [62, 63] based on the Holland wind model [64] , which generates the wind and pressure fields for each computational node in the model domain. Since the NACCS generated synthetic storms have symmetric wind field, the meteorological forcings for Synthetic35 and Synthetic145 storms in ADCIRC are calculated using the symmetric vortex formulation of the Holland Model [64] .

The analysis is repeated considering the future scenarios incorporating the projected local SLR and potential land use change due to marsh migration. SLR is directly included in the models using eustatic method [29, 31, 68, 69] , in which mean sea water level is offset by the locally projected SLR values. Different land use and land cover is represented in the model through frictional drag coefficient (Manning's N) as bottom shear stress. Additionally, the dissipation of momentum transfer from wind to the water column by vegetation in the wetlands and marshes are delineated using surface canopy and land roughness length. Details about the land cover inclusion in ADCIRC is provided in Atkinson et al. [70] and Ferreira et al. [71] . The frictional parameters are assigned on each computational node of the mesh for different land cover types taken from C-CAP database. C-CAP divides wetlands and marshes as palustrine and estuarine categories where each category is subdivided into forested, shrub and emergent wetlands. Note that the frictional coefficients will change depending on the SLR and marsh migration scenarios according to the land cover type changes within the preserves. The frictional parameters in the storm surge model for each land cover types including wetlands and marshes are provided in Table A1 .

The plot for each site shows the percent of inundated area due to storm surge for the current condition and different SLR scenarios. The zero SLR value in the x-axis of the plots represents the current condition.\nAs expected, the results show that SLR and land use change due to marsh migration will increase the inundation in all of the preserve areas. Figure 4 also shows that the percent flooded area for both current condition and the future SLR scenarios varies for each study sites. In addition, increase in flooded area substantially varied due to different rates of SLR. For example, depending on the storm intensity and location, in current condition, 7-10% of the land area of the Dameron Marsh is inundated due to storm surge, which rises up to inundating the entire reserve (100% inundation) with the \"highest\" SLR scenario regardless of the storm. On the other hand, in Monie Bay, regardless of SLR, the entire preserve area experienced storm surge inundation even under current conditions. The scenario is different for the Magothy Bay and Eastern Shore, which are located at the tip of the Chesapeake Bay. The results show a gradual increase in storm surge flooded areas due to SLR for both Eastern Shore and Magothy Bay preserve areas. None of the two preserve areas are expected to have a 100% flooded area for any storm, even with the highest rate of SLR. However, all preserve areas, except Eastern Shore, are likely to have more than 70% of the total area to be flooded with the highest SLR. Additionally, as expected for most of the cases, the storm intensity played an important role in storm surge inundation in the coastal protected areas.

The highest intensity storm, Irene, showed higher impacts on the study sites. Figure 8 shows the inundation area and the maximum water levels under different rates of SLR for hurricane Irene in the four preserve areas. The inundation maps in Figure 8 also indicates that the \"highest\" SLR can raise inundation height in the protected areas to an average of 3.5 to 5 m which is almost 1.5 to 2.5 m higher than the current day flood elevation. The study by Xia et al. (2008) [73] also found out the significance of storm track and intensity in storm surge inundation. our results in coastal protected areas. Our results indicate that storm intensity plays a significant role in inundation, maximum water levels, and wave heights in the protected areas.

Figure 8 shows the inundation area and the maximum water levels under different rates of SLR for hurricane Irene in the four preserve areas. The inundation maps in Figure 8 also indicates that the \"highest\" SLR can raise inundation height in the protected areas to an average of 3.5 to 5 m which is almost 1.5 to 2.5 m higher than the current day flood elevation. The study by Xia et al. (2008) [73] also found out the significance of storm track and intensity in storm surge inundation. Figures 8 and 9 show that, regardless of the storm, almost 100% of Monie Bay land area is inundated by storm surge. In terms of increase in flood extent, results indicate that Dameron Marsh is the most sensitive preserve area to SLR. The average percent of storm surge flooded area in Dameron Marsh increases rapidly, as the rate of SLR increases while for Magothy Bay and Eastern Shore the flooded area gradually expands with the increases in SLR. This reflects the uniqueness of the coastal protected areas in terms of their location and topography. For example, the nearshore elevation at both Eastern Shore and Magothy Bay are around 0-2 m which rises up to an average 2-5 m in areas further inland. Therefore, even in the \"highest\" SLR scenario with an average maximum water elevation of 3-3.5 m, both preserve areas are not entirely inundated (Figure 8 ). In contrast, Dameron Marsh and Monie Bay have a relatively flat and constant slope, ranging between 0-2 m within the preserve areas. Thus, a \"maximum\" of 3 m height of flooding inundates the entire preserve areas. This higher exposure to coastal flooding in these preserve areas can consequently reduce the plant growth and organic matter input that decreases with excess inundation [20] . Our findings suggest that the increase in flooding extent inside the preserves is not linearly related to SLR. A study by Li et al. [74] (2012) in Norfolk, Virginia, also found a nonlinear relationship where a 50-year storm with 1 and 2 m SLR increased total inundated area 34% and 69%, respectively, that changed to 74% and 78% when analyzed for a 100-year storm for same SLR rates. Another study in the Galveston Bay and Jefferson County, Texas, found that the SLR and changing landscapes inundated three times more land when increasing from 0.402 m to 0.926 m [15] . However, the results demonstrated a linear relationship between surge induced water elevation in the protected areas with SLR. These results differ from Bilskie et al. [13] , where for coastal areas in Alabama and Mississippi, they found that the increase in water levels was greater than the amount of water added due to SLR. It should be noted, that the focus of our study is on four coastal preserve areas that are spatially very small in compared to the coastal areas studied by Bilskie et al. [13] . These findings suggest that the preserves sizes are not large enough to allow for a fully developed interaction between storm surge hydrodynamics and friction; thus, the long wave associated to the storm surge is not significantly affected within these spatial scales, as observed by Bilskie et al. [13] in the much larger marshes of the Louisiana coast.\ninland.

[13] in the much larger marshes of the Louisiana coast. When compared with the current conditions, our results show that a maximum of 2.3 m rise in SLR can amplify the current maximum flood elevation in the protected areas by about 200%. This overall increase in maximum water elevation can largely affect the existing vegetation in coastal protected areas in Chesapeake Bay region. For current velocities, the increase is relatively small until 0.97 m of SLR, which significantly amplifies with a higher rate of SLR projections such as 1.68 m and 2.31 m. This implies that a higher rate of SLR can intensify the nearshore erosion in the coastal marshes in the preserve areas, though no linear relationship is found between SLR and current (A) (B) Figure 9 . Overall impacts of SLR and marsh migration on Percentage of inundated area, maximum water levels, maximum currents and maximum wave heights at each preserve area. The top panel (A) shows the average of the simulated Percentage of inundated area, maximum water levels, maximum currents and maximum wave heights for the selected storms in both current and future scenarios while in the bottom panel (B) percentage increase of each of the parameters from the current condition are shown for the selected sites.\nWhen compared with the current conditions, our results show that a maximum of 2.3 m rise in SLR can amplify the current maximum flood elevation in the protected areas by about 200%. This overall increase in maximum water elevation can largely affect the existing vegetation in coastal protected areas in Chesapeake Bay region. For current velocities, the increase is relatively small until 0.97 m of SLR, which significantly amplifies with a higher rate of SLR projections such as 1.68 m and 2.31 m. This implies that a higher rate of SLR can intensify the nearshore erosion in the coastal marshes in the preserve areas, though no linear relationship is found between SLR and current velocities in protected areas. Therefore, with increasing SLR, projected marsh migration and loss of wetlands, the potential shoreline erosion in the coastal protected areas are to likely intensify in future. Moreover, SLR has a significant effect on wave heights, where higher flood depths allow higher waves to propagate through the study area. Except at one site, Dameron Marsh, the increment in SLR showed an almost linear relationship with the increase in wave height in the preserve areas. A few recent studies [16, 75] found a nonlinear trend between SLR and wave heights, although their focuses were not on the coastal protected areas. In terms of percent increase from current conditions, a 0.49 m of SLR increases maximum wave heights in the protected areas by less than 50% and a 2.3 m of SLR amplifies by more than 200%. The projected increase in wave heights and water levels in the protected areas can substantially affect the ecosystem service provided by the protected areas. For example, two recent studies [46, 76] in the Chesapeake Bay regions applied observed field data in our study site to evaluate the surge and wave attenuation by coastal marshes. Both studies showed that marshes' capacity to attenuate surge and wave heights decreases with increasing inundation and water level. Thus, increase in inundation, water level, and wave heights in the preserve areas due to SLR and marsh migration will lower protected areas capacity to reduce surge level and wave heights, and provide flood protection service.\nWhile the lower rates of sea level could result in adjustable hydrodynamic changes in the study sites, a higher increase of sea level has the potential to significantly alter the hydrodynamic responses to surge and waves and the hydrologic regime within the protected areas. Our results indicate that, for the coastal preserve areas in Chesapeake Bay, considerable increase in the hydrodynamics and waves is observed when SLR exceeds by 1 m. The increasing sea level will affect the distribution of salt marshes [77] , and the losses of the saline wetlands are happening at a fast rate [8] . Our study indicates that, with storm surge, the inundation scenario will intensify in coastal wetlands and marshes. This implies that the sustainability of the marshes and wetlands in the protected areas are at a higher risk in the future. Larger currents and wave heights that are caused by the effects of SLR and storm surge might lead to increased coastal erosion. Higher current velocities and wave heights will transport more energy and momentum to the shore, which can cause a faster rate of erosion in the nearshore areas [78] . Therefore, results of the study can provide an improved understanding of the risks associated with SLR to support future management actions, policy, and practices to preserve the coastal protected areas. In addition, incorporating marsh migration in modeling future flooding can add further insights on how sea level can affect the coastal protected areas in the US. The methods applied in this study can also be implemented for other low-lying natural reserves in the coastal areas that are vulnerable to SLR and storm surge.\nThough all sites showed higher flooding, each site revealed distinct responses to SLR in terms of faster intrusion of seawater and waves. This indicates two important implications in understanding the vulnerability of the coastal marshes in the protected areas. First, for improved interpretation of how the marshes and wetlands in the protected areas will respond to SLR, local scale analysis is required, since marsh dynamics are highly site specific. Second, the incorporation of marsh migration scenarios is essential when assessing the impacts of SLR on coastal protected areas."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Coastal protected areas serve as natural habitats to multiple ecosystems and offer a range of services from flood protection to recreation. Most of the coastal protected areas contain wetlands and marshes, which are unique in nature and are exposed to flooding due to storm surge and SLR. In this study, we combined the impacts of SLR, marsh migration and storm surge on four preserve areas located in different parts of the Chesapeake Bay to assess how coastal hydrodynamics and waves within the protected areas are likely to change in the future. Coupled surge and wave simulations are implemented to gain an improved understanding of the coastal inundation impacts to the Chesapeake Bay preserve areas. We included historical and synthetic storms in our simulations to capture a spectrum of storms and their impacts in the study areas. The simulations incorporated four different local SLR projections based on the National Climate Assessment and regional land subsidence rate. Potential land use changes due to SLR driven marsh migration are also included in our analysis to provide a more accurate representation of future land cover in the protected areas.\nComparing current and projected future inundation extent, maximum flood elevation, current velocity, and waves in four preserve areas in the Chesapeake Bay showed that SLR will increase the hydrodynamics and waves impacts in coastal protected areas. Our study indicates that protected areas responses to both storm surge and SLR are highly site-specific and depend on location, topography, and coastal features of the preserve areas. Therefore, adaptation strategies and restoration plans for the coastal protected areas should be site specific. In terms of the selected sites in the Chesapeake Bay, Monie Bay is found to be the most vulnerable preserve area to coastal flooding, while Dameron Marsh appears to be most sensitive site to SLR. Results also demonstrated that the hydrodynamic and wave responses of the protected areas significantly depend on storm intensity, track and proximity to the shore. Furthermore, findings on the preserve areas in the Chesapeake Bay suggest a linear relationship between SLR and surge induced water elevation in the protected areas. Moreover, the impacts of SLR were significantly greater after a 1 m threshold of SLR, suggesting the presence of a critical limit for conservation strategies.\nThe projected increase in the hydrodynamic and wave impacts on the preserves can affect the hydrologic regime, salinity, and local geomorphology in coastal protected areas. Higher increase in inundation and potential shoreline erosion can consequently change the ecology of the wetlands and marsh in these natural reserves. While the eco-morphological consequences in the protected areas due to storm surge and SLR are not investigated in this study, the results from the regional scale storm surge and wave models can be applied in local scale hydro-morphodyanmic model to quantify marshes vulnerability to SLR and to advance the understanding of the projected ecological changes in coastal protected areas. It is worth mentioning that fine scale site-specific morphodyanmic and eco-biological data are required to address the vulnerability of tidal wetlands and distribution of marshes due to SLR. Thus, our findings derived from the coarse scale representation of marsh migration should be qualitatively taken into account at best. Additionally, model parameterization needs improvement in representing the interaction between marsh vegetation and storm hydro-and wave dynamics. However, in this study, we provide a suitable method to estimate the potential changes in hydrodynamics and waves in coastal protected areas for storm surge, SLR, and marsh migration that may help to develop necessary adaptation plans for the long-term sustainability of coastal protected areas.
