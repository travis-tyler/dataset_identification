[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The invasive colonial ascidian Didemnum vexillum occurs in Japan, North America, northern Europe, and New Zealand. It forms adhering mats on living and non-living hard substrates and alters seabed habitats. We examined the relationship of the first and last occurrences of D. vexillum recruits to water temperature and suggest it is possible to identify coastal and offshore locations that are at risk of colonization by the species based on seasonal water temperature trends. Temperature loggers and settlement plates for recruits were deployed and monitored at three shallow coastal settings in New England, including an open harbor, a marine estuary, and a nearshore island. In addition, the distribution of D. vexillum at sites on Georges Bank, an offshore fishing ground (where settlement plates could not be deployed), was compared to long-term bottom temperature data. Recruits of D. vexillum are small (0.2 to 1.0 mm) but easy to identify, and photographs illustrating the developmental stages of oozooids are presented. Recruits of D. vexillum did not appear on settlement plates at the same water temperature at the three coastal sites. Recruitment occurs in the range of 14 to 20\u00b0C and apparently is dependent on local climatic conditions. At coastal sites where we have complete records, recruitment persisted for 3.5 to 5 months; and recruits continued to appear as waters cooled to below the temperature of first occurrence. Recruitment ceased in the range of 9 to 11\u00b0C. On Georges Bank, the yearly temperature range (4 to 16-17\u00b0C) is the same in areas where D. vexillum is present and in a nearby area where D. vexillum is absent. However, in the reproductive season on the bank, temperature variability is but a few degrees in areas where the species is present; whereas it is high (11\u00b0C) where the species is absent. It is known from previous studies that in extremely cold conditions in shallow water D. vexillum colonies degenerate and all but disappear, only to regenerate as waters warm. We suggest that: 1) the degree to which colonies degrade in the cool season influences the length of time they require to regenerate, reproduce sexually, and brood larvae; 2) larval recruits will be released at the end of a developmental period as water temperatures warm, not necessarily when a particular water temperature is reached; 3) larvae likely will appear at different temperatures at climatically different sites, and at approximately the same time and temperature at climatically similar sites; 4) highly variable temperatures during the warm season likely inhibit the reproductive process; 5) the time required for a colony to develop and release larvae and the length of the warm season probably affects the length of the recruiting period at a site; 6) as waters cool, larval release by healthy colonies and recruitment might be regulated chiefly by declining temperature and therefore could end at approximately the same temperature at all sites. At deeper water sites, where minimum temperatures are warmer than at shallow sites, it is possible that D. vexillum colonies are not as affected in the cool season (i.e., do not degenerate) and thus could have a longer recruiting season. This may explain the species' successful colonization of several large areas of gravel habitat on Georges Bank."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Didemnum vexillum", "text": "is an invasive colonial ascidian that attaches to hard living and non-living substrates. The species forms mats on seabeds and other surfaces where currents are strong, and it hangs in clumps from surfaces such as floating docks where currents are weak. It overgrows other ascidians, mussels, oysters, bryozoans, hydroids, sponges, anemones, seaweeds, and barnacles (among others), alters habitats, and fouls harbor facilities, vessel hulls, and aquaculture equipment. Didemnum vexillum reproduces asexually by budding to expand colony size and sexually to produce larvae to colonize new sites. Larvae are brooded within the tunic and when released swim for a period of hours to find and attach to a suitable substrate. Fragments of colonies can reattach and grow, and serve to spread the species to new locations. The species, like most colonial ascidians, does not thrive in muddy habitats or where sediment is mobile, as colonies can be smothered and their oral siphons clogged with sediment particles. The species can tolerate temperatures that range from a low of -1 to -2\u00b0C to a high of at least 24 to 25\u00b0C. Didemnum vexillum now occurs in temperate waters in many parts of the world, including: Japan; northern Europe (France, Netherlands, Ireland); the U.S. east coast (from Long Island, NY to Eastport, ME near the border with Canada); the U.S. and Canadian west coasts (California, Washington, British Columbia); and New Zealand (North and South Islands).

A\" of recent reports is Didemnum vexillum Kott (2002) , described from New Zealand; and that Didemnum vestum Kott (2004) , described from New Hampshire, is a junior synonym of D. vexillum (Lambert, this issue 2009 , Stefaniak et al., this issue 2009 . We follow this taxonomy here.\nThe importance of water temperature in the timing of sexual reproduction in marine animals was described in the classic paper by Orton (1920) . Several recent reviews summarize the role of temperature as an important environmental factor in ascidian reproductive processes (Bates 2005; Lambert 2005a, b) . Little is known of the role of temperature in the release of larvae in the genus Didemnum. Millar (1958) reported on the effects of temperature on the breeding season of Didemnum candidum in Scottish waters by plotting the presence of developing embryos and brooded larvae against temperature. He showed that brooded larvae were most abundant in late June, before the warmest part of the year.\nWe focused on recording first and last occurrences of D. vexillum recruits, and our methods of settlement plate deployment, maintenance, and observation reflect that approach. As we did not inspect the plates every day, the timing and temperature of first and last occurrences is influenced by the number of days between plate inspections. Further study is required to document the day-by-day development of D. vexillum recruits so that the age of their developmental stages can be more accurately estimated.\nAt three coastal sites in New England (Great Harbor, Appledore Island, Damariscotta River), we used recruitment data from settlement plates and related temperature data. We observed the relative abundance of recruits, but we did not count them. Offshore on Georges Bank, we used temperature data but could not use recruitment plates and so relied on our collected samples and knowledge of the distribution of D. vexillum on gravel habitats (Valentine et al. 2007b) . The purpose of the present study is to determine the relationship of seasonal water temperatures to the occurrence of recruits of D. vexillum. This information can be used to identify sites potentially vulnerable to colonization by the species and to develop strategies for managing environments that have been adversely affected or threatened."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study sites", "text": "Great Harbor, Woods Hole, Massachusetts, 2007 The study site (Figure 1 ) is located in a large open area of the Iselin Dock complex at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (41.524\u00b0 N, 70.672\u00b0 W). The area measures 6 x 24 meters and is used for conducting biological studies and to test equipment. Water depth is approximately 16 m. It is bounded on 3 sides by pilings of cement and steel; on two of these sides wood sheathing extends to about 1.2 m below mean lower low water (MLLW). The fourth side of the area is open to the sea. The dock pilings and sheathing are colonized by attached epifauna, including mussels, barnacles, bryozoans, tunicates, sponges, and anemones, among others.

Two adjacent areas of pebble gravel habitat in U.S. waters totaling 230 sq km are colonized by D. vexillum (Figure 1 ). One area, Ga (centered at 41. 90\u00b0N, 67.45\u00b0W) , is open to fishing, and the other, Gb (centered at 41.95\u00b0N, 67.31\u00b0W), lies 9 km to the east in a zone closed to fishing near the U.S./Canada boundary.

The species is present offshore on Georges Bank gravel habitats (Ga, Gb) but not on a gravel habitat (Gc) 4-6 km north of the two colonized areas. Darkest line is the 100 m isobath.\nWater temperatures were recorded at 0.5 to 1.0 m below the water surface from January 1 to December 12, 2006 (Figure 4 ). Plates were deployed from April 29 to December 10, a period during which the initial water temperature was 8.4\u00b0C, rose to at least 20.0\u00b0C on July 30, and declined to 6.8\u00b0C on December 10.

Recruits were most abundant in late July, August, and early September, and declined in number in October. The last new recruits were observed on October 28 at a temperature of 11.3\u00b0C, but we are uncertain if this represents the actual last occurrence because the plates to be retrieved on November 12 were lost. Although there is a gap in the recruitment data for November 12, we know that recruits did not occur below a temperature of 10.0\u00b0C, because no recruits were observed on November 28 (Table 3) .

On each string, fourteen plates were spaced approximately 0.3 m apart from MLLW to 4.5 m, for a total of 28 plates. The 2 rope strings were hung 6.5 m apart alongside the wood sheathing of the dock which extends to 1.2 m (MLLW) below which the plates were within 1 m of pilings to a depth of 4.5 m (MLLW). Both the wood sheathing and the pilings are colonized by D. vexillum colonies, and plates were hung at places where colonies were most common.\nDuring the inspection process, plates were removed from the string, held in a water bath, inspected visually in air with a magnifying lens, and photographed while covered by water. Both upper and lower plate surfaces were inspected. Care was taken to keep the plates wet during the inspection process. The occurrence of D. vexillum recruits was recorded at the site and later confirmed from analysis of the digital images. After each inspection, some or all attached organisms, including small colonies of D. vexillum, were removed to provide space for new recruits. Settlement plates were deployed from April 10 to December 18, 2007 and were inspected 44 times during this period (Table 1) .\nAppledore Island, Isles of Shoals, Maine, 2007 Vertical settlement plates made of Plexiglas 10 x 10 x 0.6 cm were attached to wire grates that were fixed to submerged horizontal wooden support beams on the southwest face of a former pier. Four plates were deployed 2.0 to 2.5 m below low tide. For analysis, plates were replaced with clean ones and those removed were maintained in a water bath and taken to the laboratory where D. vexillum recruits were identified under a dissecting microscope. Settlement plates were deployed from June 7 to July 30, 2007 and were inspected every two weeks during this period (Table 2) . Horizontal settlement plates made of Plexiglas 10 x 10 x 0.6 cm were hung from a floating dock at the end of a pier. Four to six plates were deployed at 0.5 to 1.0 m below the water surface, with the recruitment surface facing the seabed. The plates were analysed in the same manner as at the Appledore Island site. Settlement plates were deployed from April 29 to December 10, 2006. The plates to be retrieved on November 12 were lost.

At the Appledore Island site, a temperature logger was deployed at 2.0 to 2.5 m below low tide and recorded temperatures at 60-minute intervals to an accuracy of 0.2\u00b0C from June 7 to July 30, 2007 ( Figure 3 ). This is a short record, so data from a nearby buoy were used to characterize the Figure 4 seasonal temperatures at the site (see below). At the Damariscotta River estuary site, a temperature logger was deployed at 0.5 to 1.0 m below the water surface and recorded temperatures at 60-minute intervals to an accuracy of 0.2\u00b0C from January 1 to December 12, 2006 (Figure 4) . The logger failed to record data from July 6 to July 29, 2006. However, the seasonal temperature trend displays little variability and allows temperatures to be extrapolated with confidence for the missing days.\nFor comparison with earlier years, temperature data were acquired for all three sites from other sources (Table 4) . Great Harbor temperature data for 2001 to 2006 were provided by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tide gauge station (8447930) located at our study site (NOAA, 2008 complete recent record is from 2003 ( Figure 5) , and is shown here as representative of the Appledore Island site. All temperature records from coastal sites used in this study were converted to average daily temperatures.\nIn the Georges Bank study areas, it was not possible to deploy continuous temperature loggers, and annual bottom temperature trends were derived from individual readings collected during all seasons from 1977 to 2007 on scientific cruises of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA, 2007) . In order to characterize the seasonal bottom temperatures of the two adjacent areas (Ga, Gb) colonized by D. vexillum (Figure 1 ), all data points from an area enclosing the two affected areas were plotted to give a yearly temperature graph compiled from data collected over a 31-year period (Figure 6 ). A similar approach was used for area Gc ( Figure  7 ) that lies 4 to 6 km to the north of the colonized areas, where D. vexillum has not been observed despite multiple surveys for benthic invertebrates from 1994 to 2007 (Valentine et al. 2007b) ."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Recognizing recruits of Didemnum vexillum", "text": "The brooded tadpole larvae of species of the genus Didemnum are thought to swim at most for several hours (Berrill 1950; Olson 1985) before settling onto a hard substrate to begin metamorphosis into the initial zooid (oozooid) of a colony. At Great Harbor in Woods Hole, we have photographically documented the development of oozooids, which range in length from 0.2 to 1.0 mm. They are smaller than recruits of the colonial ascidian Botrylloides violaceus with which they often co-occur. In very young oozooids of D. vexillum, paired lateral organs of the thorax (LOTs) appear crescent-shaped and are a pale yellow-brown color; black \"eyespots\" represent the ocellus and statolith (Figures 8, 9 ). As the oozooid develops, the LOTs become white (Figure 10 ) because they produce the calcium carbonate spicules which later migrate throughout the tunic (Kniprath and Lafargue 1980) . With continued development of the oozooid, spicules outline the oral siphon and cloacal aperture (Figures 10, 11) . The oral siphon is located at the anterior end of the oozooid, just forward of the LOTs, and the cloacal aperture is located dorsally, between the posterior parts of the two LOTs. The digestive organs, yellow-brown in color, are located in the posterior part of the oozooid; and feeding by the oozooid produces brown, spherical fecal pellets in the gut area ( Figure 10 ). As growth proceeds, white spicules accumulate in the tunic, obscuring internal organs, and the oozooid forms a colony by asexual budding (Figures 12, 13) . The most distinctive features of the D. vexillum oozooid are the paired, white crescent-shaped LOTs which are easily distinguished with a magnifying lens (Figure 11 ). We have not yet determined the time period required for settled tadpole larva of D. vexillum to metamorphose into an oozooid and for the oozooid to bud into a colony, but see Bullard and Whitlatch (2004) ."}, {"section_title": "Occurrence of Didemnum vexillum recruits and associated water temperatures", "text": "Great Harbor, Woods Hole, Massachusetts, 2007 Water temperatures were recorded at 7 depths to 10 m (MLLW) at the Woods Hole site from January 1 to December 18, 2007. Analysis of the average daily temperature records at all depths showed that the water column to 10 m was well mixed, and that all settlement plates (MLLW to 4.5 m) experienced a similar temperature regime. The record at 2 m water depth is used for illustration (Figure 2 ). Plates were deployed from April 10 to December 18, 2007 (Table 1) , a period during which the initial water temperature was 4.9 o C, rose to a maximum of 23.8\u00b0C on August 4, and declined to 3.4\u00b0C on December 18. The first recruits of D. vexillum were observed on June 26, 2007 on the bottom sides of plates at depths of 0.5 to 2.8 m at the end of a 4-day interval during which the water temperature increased from 18.7 to 19.4\u00b0C (Figure 2 , Table 1 ). Throughout the experiment, the bottoms of plates attracted by far the most recruits, with larvae settling on plates at all depths to the deepest plate at 4.5 m. Although no attempt was made to count recruits, visual observation indicated they settled in highest numbers in July and August and decreased in numbers in September, October, and November.\nThe last recruits were observed on November 27, 2007, at the end of a 8-day interval during which water temperature decreased from 9.8 to 9.3\u00b0C (Table 1) . Thus, recruiting at Great Harbor persisted from June 26 to November 27, a period of 5 months. These last recruits were monitored on 4 occasions over 21 days until December 18 when the water temperature had cooled to 3.4\u00b0C. During this period, the recruits retained eyespots, and displayed LOTs, increasing numbers of spicules in the tunic, and fecal pellets, indicating they were feeding and developing, but they did not bud new zooids to form colonies, a possible effect of low water temperatures.\nSampling of large, established D. vexillum colonies at the study site on January 4, 2008 (at 2.2\u00b0C) revealed that they contained welldeveloped brooded, unhatched larvae that displayed eye spots, tails, and adhesive papillae (used to attach larvae to a substrate). These colonies exhibited brown spots in the tunic and their cloacal canals were clogged with fecal pellets, an indication that zooids were no longer feeding properly and that the colonies likely were beginning to degenerate in response to cold conditions (Valentine et al. 2007a, Figures 10, 11) ."}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of seasonal water temperature cycles in coastal and offshore waters", "text": "In Great Harbor from 2001 to 2007, yearly minimum temperatures ranged from -2.5 to 0.6\u00b0C, excepting the abnormally warm winter of 2002, and the yearly maximum temperatures ranged from 22.5 to 24.1\u00b0C (Table 4 ). The Damariscotta River estuary site lies 160 km in latitudinal distance to the north of Great Harbor. The yearly minimum temperatures from 1997 to 2000 and in 2006 ranged from -0.1 to 1.4\u00b0C, and yearly maximum temperatures ranged from 17.1 to 20\u00b0C (Table 4) . The annual temperature range is somewhat narrower here than at Great Harbor, with Damariscotta River having milder cool and warm seasons. Appledore Island is located between the Damariscotta River and Great Harbor sites. It lies 10 km off the coast of Maine and is surrounded by Gulf of Maine waters. At the buoy located 5.1 km south of Appledore Island, yearly minimum temperatures from 2002 to 2004 ranged from 1.5 to 4.2\u00b0C and are appreciably warmer than at either Great Harbor or the Damariscotta River (Table 4) . Yearly maximum temperatures during these years at the buoy site ranged from 18.2 to 20.4\u00b0C. The record we collected at Appledore Island in 2007 is incomplete, but the yearly maximum temperature recorded was at least 19.2\u00b0C.\nThe Georges Bank study areas (Ga, Gb, Gc) are pebble gravel habitats that lie far off the New England coast on a relatively shallow bank, and at much greater water depths (45 to 65 m) than the coastal sites (Figure 1) . Plots of the long term seasonal temperature trends in areas colonized by D. vexillum (Ga, Gb), and in the uncolonized area 4-6 km to the north (Gc), show the yearly minimum is 4\u00b0C or slightly higher, and the yearly maximum is at most 17\u00b0C (Figures 6, 7) . The chief difference between the colonized and uncolonized areas on the bank is the variability of bottom temperatures during the warm season (JD 210-300). In areas colonized by D. vexillum (Ga, Gb), temperatures vary only 4\u00b0C (from 13 to 17\u00b0C); whereas in the area free of the species (Gc), temperatures vary 11\u00b0C (from 5 to 16\u00b0C)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Didemnum vexillum recruits and recruitment patterns", "text": "Little is known of the behavior of the tadpole larvae of D. vexillum. We assume their behavior is similar to tadpoles of other species of Didemnum, which are short-lived and settle within hours of leaving the colony. Berrill (1950) reported that the free-swimming period of Didemnum gelatinosum lasted approximately 2 hours. Olson (1985) showed that tadpoles of Didemnum molle usually settled in 10-15 min but could swim for up to 2 hours. We placed our settlement plates adjacent to substrates heavily colonized by D. vexillum to increase the probability that many larvae would be near the plates and to minimize the time between release and settlement of larvae. In our study, both vertical and horizontal plates successfully attracted larvae, and the lower surfaces of horizontal plates were favored over upper surfaces.\nDidemnum vexillum recruits first appeared at different water temperatures at the three coastal study sites. At Great Harbor, Damariscotta River, and Appledore Island, first recruits were recorded in the range of 14.1 to 19.4\u00b0C (Table  5 ). In a recent study at a pier overgrown by D. vexillum in the West Passage of Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, recruits were first observed on settlement plates in July 2005 (Table 5) ; settlement occurred during a 7-day period of increasing water temperatures in the range of 19 to 20\u00b0C (GSO site of Auker 2006, Figures 20, 36; Auker and Oviatt 2008) . Long term temperature records from the colonized areas of Georges Bank indicate that bottom temperatures do not exceed 17\u00b0C (Figure 6 ). Based on the foregoing data from coastal and offshore sites, we suggest that the release of brooded larvae and subsequent recruitment occur at water temperatures between 14 and 20\u00b0C and depend on local conditions.\nAt the Great Harbor (2007) Figure 4 b GSO Dock site of Auker (2006, Fig. 36) warmest part of the year. This is also the case at the GSO site in Narragansett Bay ( Recruits of D. vexillum continued to appear on the plates as waters cooled to below the temperature of first occurrence. At Great Harbor, the southern site, recruitment lasted for 5 months and ended in the range of 9.3 to 9.8\u00b0C. Colonies contained brooded larvae on January 4, 2008 (39 days after the last recruits appeared), indicating that cessation of recruitment does not necessarily mean colonies are empty of larvae. At Damariscotta River, recruitment lasted for at least 3.5 months and ended at or below 11.3\u00b0C but above 10\u00b0C. In Narragansett Bay, recruitment of D. vexillum lasted more than 3 months, from July 14 to October 21, 2005, but the experiment ended before the last recruits were observed (Auker 2006, Fig. 36; Auker and Oviatt 2008 (Osman and Whitlatch 2007) ."}, {"section_title": "Water temperature minima, maxima, and variability at the study sites", "text": "Water temperature minima in the cool season and temperature variability in the warm season are different at the study sites (Figure 1) , and these factors seem to influence the recruitment of D. vexillum larvae. The Great Harbor site is the most southerly of the three study sites and displays the lowest temperatures in the cool season, followed by the Damariscotta River estuary site, and the Appledore Island site (Table  4) . At Great Harbor, the coldest site, D. vexillum recruited at the highest temperature (18.7 to 19.4\u00b0C), followed by Damariscotta River (15.8 to 18.0\u00b0C), and Appledore Island (14.1 to 15.1\u00b0C), the mildest site (Tables 1-3, 5) . At all three sites, temperature variability (within the well-defined seasonal trend) is low in the warm season ( Figures 2, 4, 5) .\nThe offshore gravel habitats of the Georges Bank study areas lie at 45 to 65 m water depth and experience milder water temperatures than the shallow coastal sites. In the areas colonized by D. vexillum (Ga, Gb), average daily bottom temperatures range from a low of 4\u00b0C in the cool season to a high of 17\u00b0C in the warm season ( Figure 6 ). Thus, the minimum temperature on the bank is warmer than at Great Harbor and Damariscotta River, and for the most part Appledore Island (Table 4) . As with the shallow water sites, temperature variability is low in the warm season at Ga and Gb (Figure 6 ).\nArea Gc, the Georges Bank area free of D. vexillum, exhibits yearly minimum and maximum water temperatures similar to the colonized areas (Ga, Gb), but it displays high temperature variability (11\u00b0C) in the warm season (compare Figures 6 and 7) . Gc is located on the bank edge where water temperature variability is high due to the movement and interaction of strong tidal currents, tidal fronts, and the mixing of warm unstratified bank water with highly stratified cool water masses of the bank edge and Gulf of Maine to the north (Loder et al. 1992) .\nThe seasonal temperatures at Gc are well within the range tolerated by D. vexillum, and it is possible that since 2002, when the species was first observed in Ga, swimming larvae assisted by strong tidal currents could have colonized the 4 to 6 km of gravel habitat that separates Ga and Gb from Gc (Figure 1 ). In addition, Ga is trawled and dredged, and viable colony fragments could have been transported to Gc by currents and fishing activities. Although D.\nvexillum can survive at Gc, and isolated colonies might occur, its failure to colonize the area likely is related to its lack of sexual reproduction due to the high variability of bottom temperatures in the warm season and the lack of a sustained warming trend."}, {"section_title": "Implications for the spread of Didemnum vexillum", "text": "Colonies of D. vexillum degenerate and all but disappear under extremely cold conditions in shallow water. We hypothesize that the degree to which colonies degrade in the cool season influences the length of time they require to regenerate, reproduce sexually, and brood and release larvae. Thus, larval recruits will be released at the end of a developmental period as water temperatures warm, not necessarily when a particular water temperature is reached. It follows that larvae likely will appear at different temperatures at climatically different sites, and at approximately the same time and temperature at climatically similar sites. The time required for a colony to develop and release larvae (not known at present) and the length of the warm season possibly affect the length of the recruiting period at a site. Larval recruitment ceased at Great Harbor in the range of 9.3 to 9.8\u00b0C, although mature non-feeding colonies still contained brooded larvae. Less definitive data from Damariscotta River indicate larval recruitment ceased in the range of 10.0 to 11.3\u00b0C. We speculate that as waters cool, larval release from healthy colonies is regulated chiefly by temperature and therefore should end at approximately the same temperature at all sites. Finally, at deeper water sites where minimum temperatures are warmer than at shallow sites, it is possible that D. vexillum colonies are not as affected in the cool season (i.e. do not degenerate) and thus could have a longer recruiting season. Although we have not observed the Georges Bank sites in the cool season, a long recruiting period could account for the highly successful spread of the species at those sites where the minimum temperature in the cool season is 4\u00b0C or higher and temperature variability in the warm season is low.\nThe results presented here and in cited studies can be applied to predict where D. vexillum will be able to reproduce sexually and develop colonies in marine habitats, given that substrate and food requirements of the species are met.\n(1) Cold temperatures, at least to several degrees below zero centigrade, cause colonies to regress, but not all die. (2) The maximum temperature of survival of the species is not known but probably is higher than 25\u00b0C. (3) The first occurrence of recruits is not linked to a particular temperature, but likely depends on the length of time required by an overwintering colony to develop and release brooded larvae. We hypothesize that this time period depends on local temperature trends and on the condition of the colony at the end of the preceding cool season. The first occurrences of D. vexillum recruits at study sites in New England were observed at water temperatures in the range of 14 to 20\u00b0C. (4) Late in the warm season, larvae continue to recruit at temperatures below the temperature of initial appearance. Our data indicate larvae ceased to recruit in the range of 9 to 11\u00b0C. (5) During the warm season, highly variable temperatures likely inhibit the reproductive process and successful colonization.\nSome types of sites are more susceptible to colonization than others. For example, estuaries and harbors with restricted circulation are settings where warm atmospheric temperatures can elevate temperatures of shallow waters, even at higher latitudes. These sites can experience higher temperatures in the warm season than headlands of nearby outer coasts where waters freely circulate and remain cooler. Island coasts surrounded by large bodies of water can experience milder winters than nearby mainland coasts. Deeper water sites can be more stable climatically than shallow water sites. Oceanographic processes such as tidal currents and movements of water masses can affect the variability of water temperatures at a site in the warm season. At present, D. vexillum occurs throughout New England and along the Maine coast to near the U.S./Canada boundary. The species has not yet been reported from Atlantic Canada. By examining seasonal temperature trends at coastal and offshore locations and applying the information presented here, it should be possible to identify sites at risk to be colonized by Didemnum vexillum."}]
