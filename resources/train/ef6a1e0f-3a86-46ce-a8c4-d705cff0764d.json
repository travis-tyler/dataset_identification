The probable-amnestic (Pr-a) mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-storage subtype is a phenotype with 8.5 times more risk of conversion to dementia, mainly Alzheimer's disease (AD), than the possible non-amnestic (Pss-na) MCI. The aim of this study was to find the optimized cognitive composites (CCs) domain scores most related to neuroimaging biomarkers within Pr-aMCI-storage subtype patients. The Fundaci\u00f3 ACE (ACE) study with 20 Pr-aMCI-storage subtype subjects (MCI) were analyzed. All subjects underwent a neuropsychological assessment, a structural MRI, FDG-PET, and PIB-PET. \n448\nThe adjusted hippocampal volume (aHV) on MRI, the standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) on FDG-PET and PIB-PET SUVR measures were analyzed. The construction of the CCs domain scores, and the aHV on MRI and FDG-PET SUVR measures, were replicated in the parental AB255 study database (n = 133 MCI). Partial correlations adjusted by age, gender, and education were calculated with the associated p-value among every CC domain score and the neuroimaging biomarkers. The results were replicated in the \"MCI due to AD\" with memory storage impairments from ADNI. Delayed Recall CC domain score was significantly correlated with PIB-PET SUVR (\u2424 = -0.61, p = 0.003) in the ACE study and also with aHV on MRI (\u2424 = 0.27, p = 0.01) and FDG-PET SUVR (\u2424 = 0.27, p = 0.01) in the AB255 study. After a median survival time of 20.6 months, 85% from the ACE MCI converted to AD. The replication of our results in the ADNI dataset also confirmed our findings.

By contrast, neuropsychological tests are non-invasive, and may be cost-effective, better predictors of disease than neuroimaging [8] . The identification of optimal cognitive composites (CCs) domains that are related to neuroimaging biomarkers and that characterize specific phenotypes will maximize the cost-effectiveness of clinical practice and management, and recruitment into clinical trials.\nIn a recent study [9] , at The Memory Disorders Unit from Fundaci\u00f3 ACE (Barcelona, Spain) [10] which involved the follow-up of 550 MCI subjects for an average of 26.6 months, the present authors found that the majority (45.5%) of those MCI individuals who subsequently developed dementia displayed the AD dementia phenotype.\nThe MCI subjects were classified as probable/possible in function of the presence of comorbidities that could otherwise explain their cognitive deficits [9, [11] [12] [13] . Among those probableamnestic (Pr-a) MCI patients with memory storage impairment [14] (i.e., impaired recall and recognition), there was an 8.5 times greater risk to develop dementia, mainly AD, than those with the possible MCI condition, where cognitive deficits did not include memory.\nThe aim of the present study was to find the optimized CC domain scores that were most related to three brain imaging biomarkers, derived from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), [ 18 F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and Pittsburgh compound B-positron emission tomography (PiB-PET) within the Pr-aMCI storage phenotype."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "For the purpose of this study, two groups of datasets, >64 years old, were analyzed: (i) The Fundaci\u00f3 ACE (ACE) study (n = 59) with 20 Pr-a-MCI-storage subtype subjects (MCI, from now on) (60.0% men) all with multiple domains impaired and 39 healthy controls (HC) (51.3% men), were all recruited and assessed from 2010 to 2013 at The Memory Disorders Unit from Fundaci\u00f3 ACE, Institut Catal\u00e0 de Neuroci\u00e8nces Aplicades, Barcelona, Spain [10] .

Five separate PCAs were performed, one for each of the following cognitive domains: 1) learning, 2) delayed recall on memory, 3) executive functions, 4) language, and 5) praxis. Every PCA was forced to produce a unidimensional factorial solution, according to the expected unidimensional neuropsychological function assessed. The original variables contributed to the final score in a weighted way, based on the magnitude of the inter-correlations among the variables in the same composite domain. The stability of the PCA was evaluated by means of the Hotelling's T2 test. When a neuropsychological variable obtained a factorial loading <0.3 in the one-dimension solution, the variable was excluded from the analysis [31] , assuming that this variable has a poor empirical contribution to the corresponding inferred cognitive function. According this criterion, Digit Symbol coding, Digit spans forwards, and backwards subtests of WAIS-III [29] , and Commands from ADAS-Cog [30] , were each excluded from the corresponding PCA analyses.

They were classified into aHV+ (n = 17) and aHV-(n = 3) with a threshold of aHV = 3.2 cm 3 , and into FDG+ (n = 18) or FDG-(n = 2) with a threshold of FDG-PET SUVR = 1.3. Those thresholds were the biomarker values that better separated the HC and MCI groups for each case. The A\u2424 burden cut-off was taken as PIB-PET SUVR = 1.5, for 12 PIB+ and 8 PIB-subjects. The Delayed Recall CC domain score, naturally divided the sample into positive and negative subjects by its mean value of zero. Indeed, this is the threshold that best separated HC and MCI groups.\nAfter a median survival time of 20.6 months (SD: 15.5; range: 6-68), 17/20 (85%) of the ACE MCI patients developed dementia; 15 (88.2%) with AD and 2 (11.8%) with a Mixed Dementia (AD with cerebrovascular disease) ( Figs. 1 and 2 ). Over the course of the observation, one of the MCI patients died and was censored for the analysis of dementia incidence. Among this group, Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that the Delayed Recall CC was the best domain score to predict conversion to dementia compared to the other CCs (see Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Figure 1 for details) ; however, this only showed a tendency to approach significance (Wald = 3.49; p = 0.06; Odds Ratio = 7.40) (0.91-58.82 [95% CI]).\nFinally, the correlation between the five CCs domain scores and the three biomarkers was replicated using the ADNI dataset ( Table 3 ). The partial correlations between the Delayed Recall CC domain score and aHV on MRI (Table 3A) , FDG-PET (Table 3B) , and PIB (Table 3C) were the most significant in MCI from the ADNI dataset.\nAfter a median survival time of 6.5 months (SD: 5.4; range: 6 months-4years), 26/54 (48%) of the ADNI MCI patients developed dementia, specifically AD. Table 3 Partial correlations between neuroimaging biomarkers and the five CCs domain scores in MCI subjects from the ADNI dataset Within MCI with PIB-PET, Cox proportional hazards with adjustments for age, gender, and education showed that the Delayed Recall CC significantly predicted conversion to AD dementia (Wald = 11.32; p = 0.001; Odds Ratio = 2.51) (1.46 -4.29 [95% CI]) (see Supplementary Figure 2 for details)."}, {"section_title": "454", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "This work explored the relationship between five CCs domain scores, and three AD neuroimaging biomarkers covering neurodegeneration and A\u2424 deposition, within probable MCI [12, 13] subjects with memory storage impairment [9] . As previously reported [9] , the probable MCI condition had higher risk of early conversion to dementia, mainly AD than the rest of MCI individuals. Remarkably, those Pr-aMCI subjects with storage memory impairment had the most and closest risk of conversion to dementia, mainly AD compared to the other MCI subtypes.\nOf note, since the aim of our study was include only the Pr-aMCI-storage subtype subjects, we reported as a unique condition that they must all have a memory loss characterized as being one of impaired storage, that is, independently if they had single or multiple domains impaired. However, all MCI had deficits in multiple cognitive domains. Our data supports that the traditional amnestic single-domain aMCI (aMCIsd) [20] is rarely diagnosed when a comprehensive neuropsychological battery is applied, because other cognitive deficits are frequently found when neuropsychological evaluation is expanded [44] .\nOne of our central goals was to extend the limited literature of CCs domain scores combined with neuroimaging biomarkers in this population. In particular, focus on the relation with A\u2424 burden, discussed in more detail later. Then we analyzed the correlation between these two magnitudes. We found that only poorer performances on Delayed Recall CC domain score are related to reduced hippocampal volume, greater hypometabolism, and also greater A\u2424 burden. Other CCs domain scores, such as executive functions, language, and praxis, were not found to be related to neuroimaging biomarkers used. Our results are according to previous studies that reported that poorer Delayed Recall was related to reduced hippocampal volume as well as greater hypometabolism in MCI patients who were near to AD dementia conversion [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] .\nHowever, our main finding is that the A\u2424 burden of the MCI subjects, related to the Delayed Recall CC domain score performances, did not allow classifying all MCI subjects as Prodromal AD in either aHV on MRI or FDG-PET. Instead, some of them had high and other low A\u2424 burden. Importantly, that as mentioned above, we included subjects in the worst case situation in order to distinguish it, understanding that the MCI sample, all Pr-aMCI-storage subtype, has a high homogeneity phenotype, and besides this, contains some members with closely AD-like cognitive and biomarker pattern who are likely to convert in the near future. Furthermore, observed APOE 4 allele enrichment in the ACE study (70.0%), closely resembled histopathological series reported in AD [52] . In fact, almost all of MCI converted to dementia, mainly developed clinical AD.\nAs a fact, while all subjects were positive at baseline for at least one neuroimaging biomarker, only 11 (55%) subjects were positive for the three biomarkers at the same time. In contrast, 17 (85%) subjects were positive for aHV, 18 (90%) were positive for FDG-PET, and 12 (60%) were positive for PIB-PET. Also, 15 (75%) subjects were positive for aHV and FDG-PET, 11 (55%) were positive for aHV and PIB-PET, and 11 (55%) were positive for FDG-PET and PIB-PET. Regarding the Delayed Recall CC domain score, all subjects had a negative value.\nHence, Pr-aMCI-storage subjects with higher A\u2424 burden could be considered canonical prodromal AD (represented in the right bottom corner of both figures). All of the subjects with both greater hippocampal atrophy and hypometabolism could find representation in the biomarker model of pure AD [53] [54] [55] [56] . In contrast, it is likely that MCI subjects with lower A\u2424 burden behave like SNAP (suspected non-Alzheimer's pathology) subjects, i.e., those individuals with neuroimaging/biomarker evidence of AD-like neurodegeneration without clinical amyloidosis [57] (represented in the left bottom corner of both figures). All of these subjects could find representation on the neurodegeneration-first biomarker model of late-onset AD [53] [54] [55] [56] . Note that one subject might be showing low performances on the Delayed Recall CC domain score, even before showing high A\u2424 burden. In addition, other subjects with high A\u2424 burden do not show enough hippocampal atrophy or hypometabolism to be classified as prodromal AD (top right corner of both figures). All of them could find representation in the amyloid-first biomarker model of late-onset AD [53] [54] [55] [56] .\nNevertheless, two of our MCI subjects could not find representation in any of the three Jack's models [53] [54] [55] [56] (left top corner of both figures). Note that although both developed AD dementia, were in the boundaries to be considered with high A\u2424 burden based on aHV on MRI, and on FDG-PET SUVR.\nFor a big fraction of our MCI subjects, clinical and cognitive features that are: the \"probable\" clinical condition, the memory storage impairment, and the impaired Delayed Recall CC domain score precedes in this study amyloid and neurodegeneration biomarkers. This finding was unexpected given the fact that previous studies with MCI reported that the core biomarker pattern provided clinical evidence of the AD model in patients with MCI [58, 59] . The selection of this MCI population in clinical trials with the poorer performances on the Delayed Recall CC domain score could avoid substantial heterogeneity in biomarkers previously reported within amnestic MCI who were clinically similar [60] .\nOur main finding of this specific clinical-cognitive phenotype MCI observed before amyloidosis is the first reported in the literature. That is, a big fraction of our MCI subjects that converted to clinical AD dementia have not found representation in line with the current pathophysiologic model of AD; even two of our MCI subjects have not found it in any of the three different sets of biomarker models Jack and colleagues proposed [53] [54] [55] [56] .\nAfter a median survival time of 20.6 months (SD: 15.5; range: 6-68), 17/20 (85%) of the ACE MCI patients developed dementia; 15 (88.2%) AD type; and 2 (11.8%) mixed dementia (AD with cerebrovascular disease). This points out the importance of follow-up in this MCI group. However, further studies including a more extensive longitudinal clinical follow-up and anatomopathological data would be needed to corroborate these results.\nWith regard to ADNI, the procedures for the calculation of PIB SUVR and the Delayed Recall CC domain score slightly differed between samples. Also, the composite scores calculated on both datasets are not exactly the same. The corresponding CC domain score for the Delayed Recall differed on the visual memory by the ROCF test from the ADNI and the ACE and the AB255 studies, but both reflects the performance on the same cognitive domain. So although data cannot be merged across datasets, any comparison should be done between the statistical results. In addition, with our ADNI replication, we confirm that the Delayed Recall is the optimal CC domain score to look for prodromal AD, when compared to the other CC domains. Other CCs such as Learning and Executive functions domain scores were found related to hippocampal volume and FDG-PET, previously associated in MCI and AD patients with increasing disease severity [61] .\nOne of the limitations of this study is firstly the lack of amyloid PET in parental dataset AB255; thus, the sample size of subjects with amyloid PET in ACE study was small. This fact could explain that the Delayed Recall CC domain score only showed a tendency to approached significance toward superiority with respect to the other CCs domain scores, as a predictor of conversion to dementia. However, in our replication from ADNI, the Delayed Recall was the best CC domain score as a predictor of conversion to AD. Secondly, we were not able to measure sensitivity and specificity values because of the small sample sizes. Our results are limited to those Pr-aMCI-storage subtype subjects and therefore, are not applicable or extendable to the majority of MCI cases. Further studies incorporating a more heterogeneous MCI group phenotype, i.e., including the possible/probable and amnestic/non-amnestic MCI subtypes [9] could be considered.\nIn conclusion, according to our results, we strongly suggest selecting those subjects within Pr-aMCIstorage subtype with the worst performances on Delayed Recall CC domain score in order to maximize cost-benefits of clinical trial recruitment."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "We thank the patients and control subjects who participated in this project.
