Introduction"}, {"section_title": "Background of Hurricane Loss and Preparedness", "text": "On August 29, 2005 Hurricane Katrina virtually destroyed the city of New Orleans, killing many residents and displacing hundreds of thousands. As of early August 2006, the death toll exceeded 1,800 and total damages/costs were estimated to be around $125 billion (Graumann and Center, 2006). Katrina was one of the strongest storms to impact the United States in 100 years, 127-mile-anhour winds (NOAA, 2012) as it made landfall. It was a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The hurricane's storm surge was 29-feet high, which was the highest ever measured in the United States (Graumann and Center, 2006). Economists have said that damage and loss from hurricane Sandy in 2012, which blasted the U.S. Mid-Atlantic Coast and shut down New York City, could hit $50 billion (Walsh and Schwartz, 2012). The damage in lower Manhattan and the loss from two days of financial market blackout and bank closures make for a significant proportion of the loss. Sandy was the second most costly natural disaster in the U.S., following hurricane Katrina in 2005. Eqecat, a catastrophe risk modeling company, indicates that the high damage estimate is partly due to the large electrical blackouts and transportation infrastructure losses-transit and road closures. Much of the city was shut down many days longer than expected. At least 75 people died in cities along the coast, most of them centered in the New York City area. Many homes were destroyed by flooding and winds; power failures affected more than 8 million customers (Searcey, 2012). Transportation in much of New York City was a disaster due to suspended subway service, closed bridges and tunnels, and prolonged power failure in all of lower Manhattan. The largest losses will come from the financial industry, heavily concentrated in the lowest-lying, most flood-vulnerable areas in lower Manhattan, and in the heavy-hit suburbs in New Jersey. Lower Manhattan, including the Battery Park area, is easily flooded due to the fact that it is at critical lowest elevation (CLE) and is adjacent to the sea. Since the South Ferry Station of the number 1 subway line has a CLE of 4 feet, it can succumb to flooding very easily. Even though Sandy did not bring significant rainfall to New York City, the Battery was flooded by the storm surge. Although the storm was a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale (OEM, 2009), its impact was similar to that of Hurricane Donna (1960), Category 2 hurricane. People in other U.S. coastal cities, such as New York, Miami, and Boston, should prepare for possible future disasters equivalent to Hurricane Katrina and Sandy."}, {"section_title": "Literature Review", "text": "Many researchers have studied hurricane wind speeds but less research has been done on water level rise associated with hurricanes. According to Walton (Walton, 2000), early research on extreme water levels focused on analyzing observations of astronomical tide data and meteorologically driven levels. Researchers have recently begun recognizing the importance of the difference between meteorological and astronomical components in water level data, trying to estimate separately the stochastic components (meteorological surges) from deterministic components (astronomical tides). In this research, however, the previous two methods are analyzed simultaneously to determine an accurate trend. In recent years, due to climate change, the world has suffered much more extreme climatic and hydrological events. There are several studies of risk assessment of hurricanes for New York City. Lin (Lin et al., 2010) developed a model-based study of hurricane storm surge levels using the SLOSH (sea, lake, and overland surges from hurricanes) model simulation. Gornitz (Gornitz et al., 2001) analyzed sea level rise scenarios for different return periods with several global climate model (GCM) simulations. Also, the ClimAid initiative (ClimAid, 2010) New York state's assessment project for climate change adaptation strategies has published an overview of the vulnerabilities of the New York's transportation system as climate change takes place. They have concluded that hazards, risk, and potential future losses from climate change to transportation systems and the economy are likely to increase."}, {"section_title": "Motivation and Objective of Research", "text": "Hurricanes rarely have a significant impact on the New York City area, but when they become severe they can produce high winds, heavy rainfall flooding, and coastal flooding. The rise in sea water levels from a hurricane's storm surge may last for only a few hours, but in the case of a serious storm that can be enough time to flood New York City's transportation infrastructurestunnels, subways and train systems (Colle et al., 2010). Because hurricanes have not caused severe damage and losses in New York City prior to Hurricane Sandy (2012), hurricane studies relevant to New York City are not common. However, New York City is a hub of finance and economy, and flooding can bring tremendous damage. This study will focus on lower Manhattan, as it relies on water level data obtained from an observation station in that area. The lower Manhattan area has also proven to be especially prone to flood damage. This area includes the Battery, as the southern tip of Manhattan is known, Battery Park, Battery Park City, which is a planned community built on low-lying landfill along the coast, and the financial district, which is located in the vicinity of Battery Park City. During the last century, New York City has been hit by only a small number of hurricanes. Yet 2011's Hurricane Irene and 2012's Hurricane Sandy suggest that hurricanes may become annual events in the area and that the possibility of damage and loss from hurricane events are likely to increase over time. Therefore, analyzing sea water levels and estimating simulated loss are key in planning and preparing mitigating actions for major hurricane events. This research examines the long-term changes in water levels in New York City to estimate the adequacy of fit testing of a variety of probability distributions of hurricane events in New York City. The first step is to collect past storm tide data in New York City from 1920 to 2012. After analyzing these data, the next step is to determine a probability distribution for storm surge hazard. Finally, using these distributions, exceedance curves and fragility curves of the infrastructure are described to assess the risk for uncertain future events.  Also, this research is important in that it uses historical data from the last century; no previous research has been done using the full 93 years of water level observations that have been available for New York City."}, {"section_title": "Organization of Dissertation", "text": "The organization of the dissertation is described as follows: Chapter 1 contains a background introduction on historical hurricane   Since 1900, there have been 31 hurricanes ( Figure 2.1) within a 80-mile radius of New York City (NOAA, 2012). The 80-mile radius was selected and implemented so that the strongest hurricane, Donna, which passed 80 miles southeast of the city, could be included in this research. There have also been four significant nor'easters, which we will also consider for the high levels of flooding they generated. The following map ( Figure 2.2) shows the paths of hurricanes that recorded wind speeds greater than Category 1 from 1920 to 2012. Although hurricane Irene did not make landfall as a Category 1 hurricane, and Hurricane Sandy did not pass through 80-mile radius, these two hurricanes are included in this figure because they were very recent and because they caused significant flooding. Hurricane Irene did hit New York City directly as a tropical storm, and Hurricane Sandy caused tremendous damage and loss in New York City.   and 2012, along with wind speed and storm surge upon arrival in the city. Even though the original strengths varied, depending on other factors such as the radius of the storm, the route, and the origination, the damage and devastation that each hurricane caused were as severe as described in Table 2.5, which shows data obtained from OEM for the 13 coastal storms in New York City from 1938 to 2007.

These are time histories of storm surge levels before and after each hurricane has made landfall. The maximum water level is the difference between peak amplitude and lower amplitude associated with each hurricane and the period is the duration between two successive low water points when the water has the highest value. Until Hurricane Sandy occurred, Hurricane Donna had held the record for severity of hurricane impact, generating a maximum surge of 13.3 feet within 10 hours (Bureau, 1960 "}, {"section_title": "Fitting and Statistics", "text": "A time series of the maximum daily water heights from June 1920 to October 2012 in New York City is shown in Figure 2.8 (NOAA, 2012). A time series can be used by management to make plans based on long-term forecasting (Von Storch and Zwiers, 2002). It assumes that past patterns will continue into the future. With a statistical analysis of the storm tide data, the probability distribution of the maximum daily storm tide heights can be obtained. The mean of the maximum daily water heights at the Battery is 8.1 feet with a standard deviation of 0.78. Figure 2.8 also shows a linear trend: a steadily upward sloping line. This shows that the mean value of maximum daily water levels is increasing linearly with a computed constant standard deviation over time at the Battery.  The typical time history of the maximum daily tide heights is shown in Figure 2.10 from June 1, 1920 to Dec. 10, 2012 with an applied linear regression. For a statistical analysis of this time series, a moving average can be applied by creating a series of averages of different subsets of the full data set. A moving average is commonly used with time series data to smooth out certain period trends or cycles. In this case, 4 periods: 1 year, 3 years, 5 years and, 10 years          respectively. These plots indicate that the standard deviation remains essentially constant in time, while the mean value exhibits a linear increase. After subtracting the linearly increasing mean, the standard deviation was found to be a constant. Therefore, we can generate a unique distribution for the maximum daily storm surge levels from 1920 to 2012. These maximum daily data are used for the goodness of fit testing which is used to find the parent distribution. The goodness of fit of a statistical model is a measure of how well data from a set of observations comply with a specified probability distribution. In order to estimate this, the probability paper plot is generated through statistics programs such as Minitab, SPSS and the computation program MATLAB. The probability plots are used to assess how well empirical data approximates a particular theoretical distribution (Wilk and Gnanadesikan, 1968). Plots using probability papers are used for each distribution of water levels in    To establish a logistic distribution, we consider the mean and variance, which are obtained from the empirical data for the maximum daily water levels.    Hurricane Donna also signals a trend off the tail, but is still closer to the logistic distribution. If the high height values are modelled with high accuracy in this plot, we might have to select a different distribution. However, overall, this logistic curve fits for all the points from the beginning point to end. It was thus concluded that the maximum daily water levels follow a logistic distribution. An effort to better fit the right tail was abandoned in favour of fitting the maximum yearly storm surge heights."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Maximum Yearly Storm Surges in New York City (Battery Station)", "text": "In this section, the maximum yearly water levels are analyzed to find their parent distribution from 1920 to 2012. The methodology for analysing yearly maximum water levels is quite similar to the method for daily water heights but the analysis is performed independently. To obtain the parent distribution, goodness of fit testing is applied for the yearly maximum, as it was for the daily maximums.

This is the best fit for the entire curve. The data from the first point to the last point fit very well, except for two points; the first of these is not important because it is a very small value and the second is the data point representing Hurricane Sandy. It is indeed off the curve. If we try to find another curve, it is possible to find one that passes closer to the Sandy data point, but we are likely to miss the other points. Consequently, it is concluded that the best parent distribution is a GEV distribution with a mean value of 10.73 feet and a COV of 10.07%.

The statistics of such extremes can predict and help prepare for natural disasters such as the maximum hurricane event in the next n years. The exact distributions of extremes will be used here for this purpose. Consider a random variable, X, with known probability distribution PDF and CDF denoted by f X (x) and F X (x) (Katz et al., 2002). In this research, GEV distribution is considered as the known probability distribution. X 1 , X 2 ,\u2026, X n have to be independent random variables.

These extreme values will also have their respective distributions which are related to the distribution of the random variable X (Castillo et al., 2005). Denoting by Y n and Z n the random variables describing the largest and smallest value from such a sample of size n, their respective exact CDF and PDF are (Gumbel, 2004): The CDF and the PDF of Y n is The CDF and the PDF of Z n is x (y) is the CDF for one year which corresponds to the GEV distribution already established."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "In this research, we consider two cases: one, which looks at data from 1920 to 2011, excluding Hurricane Sandy; the other includes Hurricane Sandy (2012). Because we had finished this research before the arrival of Hurricane Sandy (Figure 2.30), additional research had to be conducted for the case which includes Hurricane Sandy (Figure 2.31). Depending on whether or not Hurricane Sandy is included in the data, the parent distribution determined through goodness of fit testing will be different. Therefore, we have two different types of parent distribution with 3 different parameters ( ) for the GEV distribution. These two parent distributions are considered as the CDF for one year for exact distribution of extremes of n years. Applying exact extreme value theory and using the established GEV distribution for maximum yearly storm surge levels, the probability distributions for maximum sea water levels over a range of different multi-year periods is determined. Specifically, 10, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1,000 and 2,000 years are considered. These eight distributions are plotted in Figure 2.30 and Figure 2.31. When the number of years increases, the distribution moves to the right because we are expecting a larger maximum. The mean values of these curves are displayed in Table 2.11 along with peak heights and standard deviations for our two cases. The peak heights are a value at the maximum probability density of probability distribution for periods of Multi-year. For example, 17.38 feet is the mean value for 2,000 years with Hurricane Sandy. At this time, the peak height is 16.71 feet and 1.33 of standard deviation.   The return period of a given event is the inverse of the probability that the event will be exceeded in any one year. This is the recurrence interval for estimating the time interval between events of certain intensity (Ang and Tang, 2007). Therefore, Hurricane Sandy's storm surge can be considered as a singular event, that is, a statistical outlier, based on this data set."}, {"section_title": "Comparison with Alternative Approach", "text": "These results can be compared with Lin el al.'s model-based risk assessment methodology (Lin et al., 2010). Lin el al. assessed hurricane risk using synthetic data obtained from a statistical hurricane model with the hydrodynamic model called SLOSH (Sea, Lake, and Overland surges from hurricanes) (NOAA, 2012). They developed a model-based hurricane study of storm surges. Our research, however, focuses on historical empirical data on storm surges. The SLOSH model results are compared to our research for verification and validation. Lin el al.'s synthetic data followed the generalized Pareto distribution. This is compared with the generalized extreme value distribution of the empirical data. Figure 2.32 is a histogram of the SLOSH model simulated storm surge at the Battery from Lin el al.'s stud and Figure 2.33 is a histogram of empirical data from 1920 to 2012 at the Battery with our GEV distribution. Figure 2.32 has the peak of the number of events between 7 and 10 feet and the empirical data has the peak between 10 and 12 feet. However, after these plots are compared, the return periods have come close to the Lin el al's study. Comparing the two sets of data, the synthetic data has 13.99 feet of storm surge at 500 years of return period and the empirical data has 13.78 feet for the Storm Surge at the Battery (ft) Density same return period.

Each station has its own lowest critical elevation (LCE), with the minimum being 5 feet for the South Ferry Station (Deodatis and Jacob, 2011). The lowest critical elevations for various tunnels in the area and at JFK Airport are listed below (Table 3.2). These indicate the elevation from where water will inundate a portion or all of a given structure if storm surge waters reach it. If the water level exceeds a critical elevation level, the structure will be overwhelmed by flooding and operation will be impeded. The lowest critical elevations are in feet and with respect to NAVD1988 as defined in Chapter 2.  Figure 3.5 illustrates how water enters into the subway system.

For every sample run with a different peak height and a different time history, we will obtain a different total volume of water entering the tunnel. This set of different flooding volumes is used to establish exceedance curves and fragility curves. The following flow chart (Figure 4.1) shows the simulation procedure for determining exceedance and fragility curves. After selecting values for the return period (n) and LCE (H), the first sample is run.

First, we define the general equation for the time history of the storm surge based on the time evolution of four significant hurricanes (see Figure 2.7), which were mentioned in Chapter 2 (Hurricanes Donna, Gloria, Irene, and Sandy). These four time histories are used to introduce uncertainty into our general equation (specifically with respect to the rate of exponential increase and decay).

A simple random walk approach is followed here (Pearson, 1905). The simulation procedure is described in the following. First, the ventilation grate is divided into 100 equal cells. Second, a cell is set as blocked or unblocked; if a cell is blocked by debris, that cell is considered to be fully covered. Otherwise, it is completely unblocked. Third, debris arrival is assumed to follow an exponential distribution and the spatial distribution of debris is assumed to be uniform. Fourth, different probabilities of debris removal after its arrival are considered: 0%, 10%, 30% and 50%.  In a real situation, after debris has fallen on the ventilation grate, it may be moved by different factors-rainfall, wind, continually flowing floodwater. This simulation considers four different probability cases: no clearing of the debris, 10%, 30% and 50% clearing. This, 130 minutes, duration after surge exceeds LCE, is calculated by a time-history storm surge function. When the probability of debris removal is 0%, the probability of complete coverage of the ventilation opening is 76%. However, after 50% removal of debris, the probability decreases to 38%. This simulation is computed using the theory of random walk, which we have discussed above.  given time window, the aggregate normalized loss is lower in the range of large exceedance probability levels but higher in the range of small exceedance probability levels. As we will see in Figure 4.11, when structures experience more exposure time with the same exceedance probability, there is likely to be more aggregate normalized loss.  water enters the tunnel through a grate that has been obstructed by debris, because less water enters the tunnel, the probability of flooding will decrease. In 100 years, when the probability of debris removal is 0%, the exceedance probability is 85%, but when the probability is 50%, the exceedance probability is decreased to 72%.

These damage levels are divided by the vulnerability of the structure, namely the capacity of the total tunnel volume.    Finally, in Figure 4.17 we compute all of the fragility curves. This is the set of fragility curves for the South Ferry Station at Battery Park. Fragility curves show that up to a certain level of storm surge, the probability of flooding rests at 0, but once a threshold is reached, the exceedance probability rises quickly toward a probability of 1: complete flooding. There are 4 graphs-showing minor, moderate, serious, and complete damage-for different return periods n: 1 year, 10 years, 50 years and 100 years. Complete damage means the probability flooding of the tunnel volume is over 100%, collapse damage and moderate damage are when the probability of flooding of the tunnel volume is over 50%. The methodology of hurricane analysis using Monte Carlo simulation has been developed to predict probabilistic events and the risk of flooding subject to exact distribution based on GEV distribution in a given time window. Contrary to previous research, which has been based mostly on theoretical models, the main focus of this dissertation is the empirical data available for water levels in New York City over the last century. GEV distribution was used as the parent distribution to determine applying exact extreme value theory, the parent GEV distribution was used to determine the probability distributions for maximum sea water heights over a range of different multi-year periods including 5, 10, 50, and 100 years. We established probability distributions for maximum annual storm surge levels based on real data in New York City. Using these distributions we could determine exceedance curves and fragility curves related to flooding of subway tunnels in New York City. Fragility curves and loss exceedance curves were calculated to assess the reliability of the underground infrastructure. Using the established probability distributions for sea water levels, the vulnerabilities of different parts of the underground infrastructure in New York City were studied. The models and methodologies developed in this dissertation can be used to predict and calculate vulnerabilities in the infrastructure and to reduce the damage and loss to infrastructure in the event of future hurricanes that may affect New York City. The stochastic analysis of water levels using Monte Carlo simulation was developed through simplified examples. This methodology can be applied to generate a reliability assessment for several infrastructures subjected to hurricane loading and storm surges. The concept of fragility curves can be used to express the vulnerabilities of different parts of the infrastructure. An additional element and a crucial factor in estimating potential future losses and planning mitigation actions will be expected rises in overall sea level. Future empirical data as well as ongoing estimations of sea level rise will need to be included in analysis of possible future damage from hurricanes. From FEMA's 100-year flood in coastal zone, there are 3 scenarios-current sea level with a 100-year coastal flood, 2-foot rise in sea level, 4-foot rise in sea level. Adding these scenarios in this research, the simulation will make more extreme results. The results of this and future studies can be used for evaluation of mitigation measures using a cost-benefit analysis. Natural disasters such as earthquakes, cyclone, hurricanes, and so on, are unpredictable events that can cause much damage in a short time. There have been many cases of natural disasters in history and these disasters cause massive destruction in society. We cannot stop natural disasters, but we can reduce their damage and loss to prepare to deal with random crises. This research is useful to predicting future events and preventing tremendous damage from destruction."}]
