[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract. Mounting evidence associates a lifetime history of major depression (LMD) with an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies have shown that major depression (MD) is strongly linked to pathophysiological markers of AD, such as cortical amyloid-\u2424 (A\u2424) burden. However, no imaging studies have shown in vivo whether an LMD is linked to increased A\u2424 accumulation in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in four cortical regions that have been highly associated with increased A\u2424 deposition in previous literature: frontal, cingulate, parietal, and temporal. Drawing from the ADNI database, we found that patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI) and an LMD (n = 39) had significantly higher 18 F-Florbetapir standardized uptake value ratios, a surrogate measure of A\u2424 deposition, mainly in the bilateral frontal cortex, compared to patients with aMCI without an LMD (n = 39) (p = 0.02). This difference was not explained by current depressive symptoms, vascular risk factors, or the use of different PET scanners. The results were reliable employing two independent methods for analysis: region-of-interest and voxel-based analyses. Increased A\u2424 in the bilateral frontal lobes may be a biomarker of depressive symptomology in aMCI patients. Further studies should test whether higher A\u2424 predicts future conversion into AD in this population."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Several studies link a lifetime history of major depression (LMD) with an increased risk of developing * Correspondence to: Ariel Graff-Guerrero, MD, PhD, Multi- late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) [1] [2] [3] [4] . Two metaanalyses report that major depression (MD) can almost double the risk of developing dementia [5, 6] . Moreover, a single episode of late-life depression is found to elevate the risk of AD by 4-to 6-fold [7] . Reynolds et al. reported that MCI patients with late-life depression who were on donepezil, which is a treatment for AD, showed decreased conversion rate to dementia, in comparison to those who were on placebo [8] .\nDepression is a potentially modifiable risk factor for AD and projections indicate that successful interventions targeting late-life depression might reduce the prevalence of AD by up to 10.6% globally [9] .\nMild cognitive impairment (MCI) is thought to be a transitional risk state between normal aging and AD [10] . The conversion rate from MCI to AD varies from as low as 10% to as high as 100%, depending on the follow-up period and controversially, the amnestic, as opposed to the non-amnestic type of MCI [11] [12] [13] . Additionally, among patients with MCI, depression is one of the most prevalent neuropsychiatric symptoms with a prevalence rate of up to 20% [14] . Patients with MCI and depressive symptoms are more likely to convert to AD than those without depression [15, 16] . This is supported by an autopsy study, which reported that patients with AD and MD had more hippocampal plaques and neurofibrillary tangles than AD patients without MD [17] . This result suggests that depression adds to the amyloid burden above and beyond the AD itself.\nThrough the use of positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers, such as 18 F-2-(1- [16] -ethylidene) malononitrile (FDDNP), 11 C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB), and 18 F-Florbetapir (AV-45), it is possible to estimate amyloid-\u2424 (A\u2424) deposition in vivo [18, 19] . A recent study using AV-45 revealed that A\u2424 accumulation is increased in frontal, temporal, and parietal regions of depressed patients, in comparison to nondepressed patients [20] . Another study reported that current depression scores in patients with MCI are associated with increased lateral temporal FDDNP binding [21] . In addition to frontal, parietal, and temporal regions, the cingulate region has been linked to increased A\u2424 accumulation [22] . Taken together, current evidence supports the notion that the cortical A\u2424 burden may be higher in depressed MCI patients within frontal, cingulate, parietal, and temporal regions.\nHowever, to date, no previous PET study has directly tested whether an LMD is linked to A\u2424 accumulation in these aforementioned regions. Using data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) databases [23] , we compared the AV-45 standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) in these four region of interests (ROIs) between amnestic MCI patients with an LMD (aMCI+LMD) and amnestic MCI patients without an LMD (aMCI-LMD). Investigating these a priori regions, we hypothesized that the aMCI+LMD group would have higher AV-45 SUVR in frontal, cingulate, parietal, and temporal region in comparison to the aMCI-LMD group."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study patients and diagnosis", "text": "The entire dataset was downloaded from ADNI-1, ADNI-2, and ADNI Grand Opportunity (ADNI-GO) databases on 29 March 2014 [23] . The ROI-based AV-45 dataset that we used was updated as of 2 May 2014. Briefly, in ADNI-1, 800 participants, including controls, patients with aMCI, and patients with mild AD, were recruited from 50 different sites in Canada and the United States [24] . Each subject was either an English or Spanish speaker, aged between 55 and 90 years, and had a study partner able to provide an independent evaluation of functioning. The key eligibility criteria for aMCI participants were: a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score [25] of equal or higher than 24 of 30, a memory complaint, having objective memory loss measured by education adjusted scores on the Wechsler Memory Scale [26] Logical Memory II, a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score [27] of 0.5, an absence of significant levels of impairment in other cognitive domains, essentially preserved activities of daily living and an absence of dementia. In ADNI-2, 100 early-stage aMCI patients and 150 late-stage aMCI patients were recruited from 55 different sites from Canada and the United States [28] . In ADNI-GO, 200 participants, including patients with mild AD and early aMCI were recruited. Eligibility criteria in ADNI-2 and ADNI-GO were identical to those in ADNI [29] . Scores on the Functional activities questionnaire (FAQ) [30] , Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) [31] and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) [32] , Modified Hachinski Ischemic scores [33] , which assesses vascular dementia, history of cardiovascular disease (CVD), systolic blood pressure and current smoking status, were obtained from ADNI-1, ADNI-2, and ADNI-GO. For our current study, we only included patients with aMCI who had both a T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and a AV-45 PET scan completed within a 6-month interval between each scan (68 patients completed within a month interval between each scan, 5 patients within a 2-month interval, 3 patients within a 3-month interval and 2 patients within a 6-month interval).\naMCI-LMD patients were matched to aMCI+LMD patients based on following conditions. Discrete factors such as gender, apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) genotype, race, ethnicity, and marital status were matched between the two groups; continuous factors, including age, education years, and scores on MMSE, FAQ, and CDR were also matched.

The increased AV-45 SUVR was found employing a predefined set of ROIs informed directly by the ADNI database and confirmed by a voxel-based parametric analysis. The confirmatory voxel-based analysis found that the increased AV-45 SUVR was in the bilateral frontal cortex including the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), bilateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). In addition, the voxel-based analysis reported increased AV-45 SUVR in the superior temporal gyrus and anterior cingulate. The ROI global AV-45 SUVR was no different between the two groups. This is consistent with previous findings that reported no difference in global A\u2424 deposition between depressed and non-depressed persons [20, 40] .\nParticipants were matched on potential confounding factors, such as age, gender, education years, race, ethnicity, CDR score, FAQ score, MMSE score, NPI score, apoE4 genotype, and marital status. Additional analyses were also conducted, controlling for current GDS score, vascular risk factors, and different PET scanners, to ensure that any difference in AV-45 SUVR was related to an LMD, rather than any other variables. Moreover, according to the vascular depression hypothesis, the central mechanism of depression is disruption of the prefrontal system through accumulation of frontal vascular lesions [41] . As there is high comorbidity among depression, vascular risk factors, and vascular disease, we controlled or matched for vascular risk factors that may contribute to the association between A\u2424 accumulation and depressive symptoms [42] . This approach reduced the possibility that vascular damage may lead the higher A\u2424 accumulation in frontal regions showed in the aMCI+LMD group. Additionally, we also observed statistically significant increase of AV-45 SUVR in the frontal region of the aMCI+LMD group without controlling for these covariates (Fig. 2) .\nOur study identified increased AV-45 in the bilateral frontal cortex of the aMCI+LMD group. The potential mechanisms by which an LMD can elevate the level of A\u2424 deposition in the frontal region of aMCI patients are currently unclear. Nonetheless, cortisol has been implicated in the pathology of depression and A\u2424 deposition [43, 44] . Stress-level glucocorticoid administration increases A\u2424 formation by elevating the levels of amyloid-\u2424 precursor protein (A\u2424PP) and A\u2424PP cleaving enzyme, suggesting that cortisol may facilitate the formation of A\u2424 plaques [45] . According to the glucocorticoid cascade hypothesis of depression, stress elevates glucocorticoid levels, which can in turn have neurotoxic effects in the hippocampus. Furthermore, neuroinflammation has also been associated with the pathology of depression and A\u2424 deposition [46] . There is evidence showing that chronic neuroinflammation may explain the structural changes, including the formation of A\u2424 plaques, in dementia and other types of neurodegenerative disorders [47] . Pro-inflammatory cytokines are thought to regulate a cascade, which ultimately results in over-secretion of cortisol [48] . There are studies suggesting that A\u2424 deposition in humans occurs early in the prefrontal region [49, 50] . Difference in cortisol response may mechanistically explain the link between an LMD and increased A\u2424 accumulation in the frontal lobes [51] . Thus, cortisol and neuroinflammation may contribute to the elevation of A\u2424 deposition levels in the aMCI+LMD group. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanistic explanation for increased A\u2424 deposition in this population.\nAnother explanation that links depression and A\u2424 deposition is modulation at the level of the N-methyl-D-asparate receptor (NMDAR) [52] . Dysregulation of calcium influx through the NMDAR can increase the level of A\u2424 by increasing the expression of amyloidogenic isoforms of A\u2424PP [52] . A recent review notes that depression may induce chronic stimulation of the NMDAR, ultimately resulting in elevated levels of A\u2424 due to increased calcium influx [53] . Thus, cortisol, neuroinflammation, and chronic stimulation of the NMDAR may explain the pathway linking MD and elevated A\u2424 deposition.\nIt is widely accepted that frontal dysfunction is implicated in the pathophysiology of depression [54] . Meta-analyses report that MD may be linked to dysfunction of frontal connectivity to other cortical and subcortical regions [55, 56] . Moreover, brain-imaging studies have reported that depressed patients show This table highlights the regions of higher AV-45 SUVR in the aMCI patients with a lifetime history of major depression, in comparison to aMCI patients without a lifetime history of major depression. They were included if they were statistically significant at p < 0.01, uncorrected. aMCI, amnestic mild cognitive impairment; AV-45 SUVR, 18 F-Florbetapir Standardized uptake value ratio; BA, Brodmann area.\ndecreased activity in frontal regions during functional imaging tasks [57] . We observed that the aMCI+LMD group had higher AV-45 in the DLPFC than the aMCI-LMD group. The DLPFC is thought to suppress negative affect through top-down inhibition of the amygdala [58] , which may be a protective mechanism against depression [59] . A study examining Vietnam veterans showed that DLPFC lesions were positively correlated with current depression scores [60] . Another study reported that DLPFC cerebral blood flow predicts the severity of depressive symptoms in MD patients [61] . DLPFC lesions are also associated with labile affects, poor goal-directed activity, and depression [62] [63] [64] . Furthermore, a recent study revealed that the number of depressive episodes, but not the current depressive state, was associated with cortical thinning in the left prefrontal cortex [65] . Therefore, our findings that the aMCI+LMD group had increased A\u2424 accumulation in the PFC, compared to the aMCI-LMD group, are in keeping with a frontal dysfunction model of depression. While there is evidence that left frontal lesions are associated with depression [66, 67] , the right frontal region has been also implicated in depression [68] . A study suggested a strong link between late-life onset depression and right frontal atrophy, but not with left frontal atrophy [69] . Neurostimulation studies further support the evidence of frontal involvement in MD. Left PFC repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (r-TMS) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), is effective for the treatment of depression [70] . Both high-frequency r-TMS and anodal tDCS to the left PFC resulted in significantly higher antidepressant efficacy compared to sham stimulation [71, 72] . On the other hand, low-frequency r-TMS, which elicits inhibitory action, targeting the right DLPFC, but not the left DLPFC, was shown to be effective in MD patients [73] . Together, these findings suggest that abnormalities in the bilateral PFC may be related to depression symptomatology.\nThe mechanisms underlying the link between depression and MCI are currently unknown. One study revealed that depression may simply be an early manifestation of AD symptoms prior to cognitive decline [74] . A recent study demonstrated that there was increased A\u2424 accumulation in patients with an LMD, in comparison to patients without an LMD [20] . Our study focused selectively on aMCI patients, and our findings reinforce the previous literature, which reveals that an LMD may play a significant role in elevating the A\u2424 accumulation. There are findings suggesting that aMCI+LMD patients are at increased risk of developing dementia than aMCI-LMD patients by more than two-folds [75] . Furthermore, a study revealed that patients with MCI who are PIB-positive are more likely to convert to AD patients than those who are PIB-negative [13] . All these findings suggest that both MCI patients with an LMD and MCI patients with high A\u2424 depositions are at a higher risk of developing AD. Thus, future longitudinal studies need to investigate the conversion rate from aMCI+LMD to AD in order to investigate whether LMD may be a strong predictor of AD.\nThere are limitations to the current investigation. First, the ADNI study did not specifically aim to explore the role of depression on A\u2424 accumulation, therefore the study did not include several details about depression, such as time since onset of depression, and the duration and number of depressive episodes (i.e., whether participants were continuously depressed, only depressed for a brief period, or if they had recurrent episodes). Another limitation of defining LMD involves underdiagnosis of depression during the time when the participants were diagnosed with depression [76] , which may result in insufficient treatment of depression. As a result, these factors may influence the differences between the groups.\nSecond, the diagnosis of MD was based on clinical interviews with the participants; it was not obtained using a structured psychiatric interview. However, we addressed this issue by excluding participants with unspecified information about whether they met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder criteria of MD. Third, there was a trend level difference in current GDS score between groups. To address this discrepancy, we included current depressive symptoms as a covariate in our analysis. Future studies should examine the relationship between current depressive symptoms and cortical A\u2424 accumulation using AV-45. Fourth, the study was limited by the use of the radiotracer AV-45 to quantify A\u2424 accumulation, as AV-45 may not bind to all A\u2424 plaques [77] . Fifth, the causality between A\u2424 and depression may be bi-directional. There are few studies showing that injection of A\u2424 oligomers and A\u2424 peptide induce depressive-like behaviors in rats [78, 79] . Although these studies were carried out in rodents, findings from these studies suggest that high A\u2424 deposition may promote depression in humans. Sixth, many of the participants with an LMD were or had been on antidepressant medications for years. There has been one study showing that antidepressant may reduce CSF A\u2424 production in healthy individuals and transgenic AD mice [80] . However, future studies need to further investigate how antidepressant usages affect cortical A\u2424 deposition in aMCI patients. Seventh, cortisol measures were not included as covariates in the analysis. Not every participant had cortisol measures, and among those who had them, there was a temporal discrepancy between cortisol assessments and PET scans. Given that cortisol may increase cortical A\u2424 formation [45] , future studies need to investigate whether current cortisol level mediates the relationship between LMD and cortical A\u2424 deposition. Lastly, in addition to increased cortical A\u2424 deposition, other biomarkers of AD, such as hippocampal loss [81] and white matter hyperintensites [82] , may be associated with LMD in aMCI population. A recent meta-analysis highlighted that late-life depression increases the risk of subsequent onset of both vascular dementia and AD, but the risk was higher for subsequent vascular dementia [83] . This finding suggests the importance of future studies investigating the relationship between LMD and different biomarkers for various types of dementia.\nIn conclusion, we found that the aMCI+LMD group had significantly higher AV-45 SUVR in the frontal region, in comparison to the aMCI-LMD group, controlling for current depressive symptoms, vascular risk factors, and the use of different PET scanners. Voxel-based analysis revealed that the difference was present mainly in the bilateral frontal regions. With two independent methods, we obtained consistent findings, which was higher frontal AV-45 SUVR in the aMCI+LMD group. We also observed in the voxelbased analysis a higher AV-45 SUVR in the right temporal region and left anterior cingulate, which was not observed in the ROI analysis. The voxel-based analysis may be a more sensitive method for small regions within larger ROIs. To sum up, our finding suggests that a region-specific frontal A\u2424 accumulation is associated with the occurrence of past depressive episodes in aMCI patients. Future prospective studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to replicate these findings and to further explore the mechanistic underpinnings of this relationship.
