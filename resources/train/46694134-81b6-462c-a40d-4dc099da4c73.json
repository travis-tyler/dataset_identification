However, the influence of VEGFA gene variants on clinical and neuroimaging phenotypes in psychotic disorders has yet to be shown. In the present study, we examined whether different VEGFA gene variants influence psychosis risk, symptom severity, cognition, and brain volume. The study group included 480 probands (Bipolar I disorder with psychosis, n = 205; Schizoaffective disorder, n = 112; Schizophrenia, n = 163) and 126 healthy controls that were recruited across six sites in the B-SNIP consortium. VEGFA variants identified for analysis (rs699947, rs833070, and rs2146323) were quantified via SNP chip array. We assessed symptoms and cognition using standardized clinical and neuropsychological batteries. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), medial temporal lobe, and hippocampal volumes were quantified using FreeSurfer. In our sample, VEGFA rs2146323 A-carriers showed reduced odds of being a proband (p = 0.037, OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.43-0.98) compared to noncarriers, but not for rs699947 or rs833070. No clinical or neuroimaging associations were identified for rs699947 or rs833070. In general, we found that the three SNPs exhibited several significant negative relationships between psychosis symptoms and brain structure. In the probands and control groups, positive relationships were identified between several cognitive and brain volume measures. The findings suggest VEGFA effects in the DLPFC and hippocampus found in animals may also extend to humans. VEGFA variations may have important implications in identifying dimensional moderators of function that could be targeted through VEGFA-mediated interventions."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) dysfunction may contribute to a number of pathological processes that characterize psychotic disorders. VEGFA is an essential molecule for angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and brain plasticity and is distinct from other neurotrophic factors in its major angiogenic function 1, 2 . VEGFA can promote proliferation of endothelial cells, neural stem cells, neurons, and mature astrocytes 1 . In the adult rodent brain, an enriched environment or overexpression of VEGFA can stimulate neovascularization, hippocampal neurogenesis, and improve cognitive performance, whereas blocking endogenous VEGFA function impairs the angiogenic, neurogenic, and cognitive response to neuro-enhancing stimuli [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . In schizophrenia, altered VEGFA signaling has been implicated via transciptomic and epigenomic analysis of prefrontal cortical post mortem samples 5, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Imaging genetic studies of VEGFA single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in healthy subjects have demonstrated that minor allele carriers for rs833070 and rs2146323 have smaller hippocampal volumes and rs699947 minor allele carriers have reduced total gray and white matter volume 12, 13 . These polymorphisms were also significantly different (p < 3e\u22123, OR = 0.97 to 1.04, comparing schizophrenia vs. controls) in the Psychiatric Genome Consortium (PGC) SZ working group analysis, but this did not meet genome-wide level of significance at 5 < 10e\u22128 14 . It is well established that antipsychotic treatment results in changes in VEGFA levels that are related to the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) positive symptoms but not negative symptoms. Additionally, we have identified robust cognitive deficits and smaller medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures in psychosis probands compared to controls, and these abnormalities correlated with cognition and psychosis severity [15] [16] [17] . However, there are no studies to date examining the effects of these VEGFA polymorphisms on clinical and structural neuroimaging phenotypes in psychotic disorders.\nThis study was based on the cross-sectional BipolarSchizophrenia Network on Intermediate Phenotypes (B-SNIP) consortium, which assessed clinical, cognitive, and neurobiological phenotypes across the psychotic spectrum. We took an integrated genetic and phenotype approach to (1) investigate the disease risk associated with rs699947, rs833070, and rs2146323, (2) determine the effects of these genetic variants on positive symptoms, memory, and executive function, and (3) evaluate their influence on DLPFC and MTL structure as well as hippocampal morphology."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study participants", "text": "The study group included 480 probands (n = 205 Bipolar I with psychosis, BPP; n = 112 Schizoaffective disorder, SAD; n = 163 Schizophrenia, SZ) and 126 healthy controls (HC) that were recruited as part of the B-SNIP multisite study at Harvard University, Wayne State University, Maryland Psychiatric Research Center, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Institute of Living/Yale University, and University of Illinois at Chicago.

We performed the analysis in the proband (combined groups consisting of SZ, SAD, BPP) vs. control groups to enhance the study power and to demonstrate that VEGFA genotype to phenotype features cross diagnostic boundaries. Genotype and allele frequencies were calculated by the gene-counting method and each polymorphism was tested for Hardy\u2212Weinberg equilibrium using \u03c7 2 goodness-of-fit tests using the R package SNPassoc (http://www.creal.cat/jrgonzalez/ software.htm). The association between target SNPs and the risk of being a proband under two inheritance models, codominant and dominant models, was performed using logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex, and ethnicity factors. To validate our results, we performed a (1) sitespecific analysis with sites containing a large enough sample size and (2) we created a training and test dataset with a 70/30 random split of our whole sample. All statistical tests were two-sided and p < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant. Bonferroni correction was applied by multiplying the p values by the three SNPs being examined, which were carefully selected by identifying relevant SNPs from the PGC schizophrenia and bipolar datasets, as well as two structural neuroimaging studies [12] [13] [14] 26 . Subjects with imaging measures outside of four standard deviations were removed (n = 1) and those between three and four standard deviations were winsorized to the third standard deviation (n = 12). Contrasts between carriers and noncarriers within a group (HC or Probands) were run on clinical, cognitive and imaging measures using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) or general linear hypothesis test while controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, and site for a total of 36 comparisons (3 SNPs and 12 traits) for a Bonferroni corrected p value of 0.0014. In probands, partial correlations within a phenotype and genotype were run using Kendall-tau correlations, adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, and site.\nAs in previous genetic neuroimaging studies 12, 13, 27 we included age, sex, ethnicity, and site as covariates when examining clinical and neuroimaging variables and excluded intracranial volume (ICV) for neuroimaging analysis in our basic model. We avoided correcting for ICV since it could be related to the disease and diminish the possibility of detecting associations that differentiate cases and controls, or that are related to the evolution of the disease. We also performed an analysis covarying for duration of illness, PANSS total negative symptoms, and average chlorpromazine equivalents.

This finding was replicated in one of our sites and in our training dataset. No significant effect was noted for rs699947 or rs833070. We also demonstrated that rs2146323 A-carriers in probands were associated with reduced hallucinations and greater volume in the DLPFC and parahippocampus. We did not identify any significant clinical, cognitive, or structural associations for rs699947 or rs833070 in probands or controls. Finally, we showed that all three SNPs exhibited several significant negative relationships between psychosis symptoms and brain structure, as well as showing that in probands and control groups, positive relationships were identified between several cognitive and brain volume measures. These results support our hypothesis that VEGFA polymorphisms may not only play a role in reducing psychosis odds, but that rs2146323 might confer a neuroprotective effect on clinical and neuroimaging phenotypes.\nIn this cross-sectional study, we found that rs2146323 A-carriers were associated with a reduced odd of being a psychosis proband and we were able to replicate this finding, while rs833070 or rs699947 were not risk conferring. The PGC SZ working group identified a nongenome-wide significant associated risk for rs699947, rs833070, and rs2146323 14 , which further enhances the significance of our finding. However, the PGC bipolar disorder working group did not identify an associated risk for rs699947 or rs2146323 (rs833070 was not included), which included a mix of bipolar patients that were not differentiated for lifetime psychotic symptoms 26 . These discrepant results might be due to our inclusion of psychotic bipolar I disorder subjects, which is distinct from the bipolar types used in the PGC analysis. Finally, a cross-sectional genetic study of schizophrenia in a Han Chinese population showed that rs699947 nominally decreased the risk of schizophrenia in a recessive inheritance model, but they did not identify an association for rs833070, and they didn't test for rs2146323 22 . To the best of our knowledge we are the first group to demonstrate that the VEGFA polymorphism, rs2146323, has a dimensional effect on psychosis membership.\nThe function of rs2146323 has yet to be determined, but we do know that it lies within intron 2, is located in 111-bp 5\u2032 of exon 3, is distant from predicted transcription factor binding sites, and is not predicted to be involved in exon splicing alterations 28 . Only one study has examined the effect of the rs2146323 variant on peripheral VEGFA levels and they identified a significant association in their detection sample, but not in their replication sample 29 .\nOther studies have implicated it as a predictive maker for treatment response in improving lung function in asthmatic patients 30 , enhancing anatomic outcome in agerelated macular degeneration (ARMD) 31 , and increased retinal thickness in ARMD 32 . In regards to rs699947 and rs833070, they are located on the promoter region of VEGFA, can result in changes in VEGF expression levels, and have been proposed to have a pharmacogenetic association in neovascular ARMD, but with inconsistent findings 32 . Our finding that rs2146323 is less frequently present in our most compromised biotype 1 group further suggests a biologically plausible mechanism involving VEGFA. It is possible that rs2146323 and/or rs699947 might alter VEGFA expression or isoform formation, which could influence brain development, neuroplasticity, and neuro-protection. Thus, these observations make rs2146323 a promising target for unveiling the mechanism of this polymorphism on VEGFA expression, structure, and function.\nIn this study, we demonstrate that rs2146323 A-carriers exert a specific reduction in PANSS hallucination subscale scores but no effect was identified for rs833070 or rs699947. There are no human or animal studies evaluating the effects of VEGFA polymorphisms on psychotic or cognitive phenotypes in psychotic disorders. However, our findings align with animal studies, which have shown that VEGFA, VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1/Flt-1), and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2/KDR) signaling affect working memory primarily by modulating neuroplasticity at the hippocampus or through peripheral neurotrophic effects [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] 33 . Our findings are further supported by human studies, which have demonstrated that the effects of psychotic symptoms are mixed 34 , whereas VEGR1/Flt-1 and VEGFR2/KDR dysregulation were associated with worse psychotic symptoms in a prospective familial high risk for psychosis study 35, 36 , a post mortem SZ study 10 , and in case reports of systemic VEGFR1/Flt-1 administration 19, 20, 37 . Additionally, treatment with antipsychotic or antidepressant medications has been shown to modulate VEGF levels and is associated with improved treatment outcomes in SZ, bipolar and major depressive disorder [38] [39] [40] [41] . Also, we would hypothesize that since rs2146323 is a potential pharmacogenetic predictor of treatment response, that the association between fewer hallucinations and rs2146323 carrier status could reflect treatment response to antipsychotics.\nIn our neuroimaging analysis, we found that the neuroprotective effects of rs2146323 on clinical phenotypes were also evident across the hypothesized brain regions associated with psychosis. Specifically, we found that rs2146323 A-carriers exhibited greater volume in the dorsolateral prefrontal and parahippocampal regions in probands, and this effect was specific to rs2146323 and not rs699947 or rs833070. This is the first study to research the effects of polymorphisms on brain structure in a psychotic disorder group. One healthy volunteer study assessed the effects of four variants (rs833068, rs833070, rs2146323, and rs3025020), and showed that rs2146323 and rs833070 carriers had reduced hippocampal concentrations compared to major allele carriers, but their sample was smaller than ours 12 . Additionally, we observed in probands that rs699947 T-or rs2146323 Acarriers have inverse relationships between PANSS positive symptoms and prefrontal-hippocampal structure, which is an effect also seen in major allele carriers for those same SNPs. In regards to cognition, we found that the positive relationship between BACS composite score and hippocampal volume persisted for rs2146323 Acarriers and CC individuals in the proband and control group, which suggests that more brain volume was related to better cognition and lower symptom levels. Taken together, our findings relate to animal and human studies showing that it modulates cytoarchitecture, hallucinations, and memory in psychotic disorders.\nThe findings suggest that the effects of prefrontal cortex and hippocampus found in animals extend to humans and further understanding of the effects of variation might have important implications for identifying a subgroup of patients with psychosis that are more vulnerable to DLPFC and hippocampal pathology, as well as those that are most likely to benefit from mediating interventions."}]
