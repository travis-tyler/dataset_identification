[{"section_title": "", "text": "Nearly half of all undergraduates take out student loans over the course of their enrollment to help them pay for their postsecondary education; this includes nearly two-thirds of students who attend private nonprofit 4-year colleges and about 90 percent of students enrolled in for-profit institutions (Wei and Skomsvold 2011, table 1). In the decade between 2000-01 and 2010-11, total borrowing per full-time-equivalent (FTE) undergraduate student increased by 56 percent (Baum and Payea 2011). While student loans improve access to postsecondary education, repaying them has become increasingly difficult for students who are unemployed, underemployed, or who earn a limited income; furthermore, these circumstances are more common among students who do not complete a degree than among those who do (Gladieux and Perna 2005;Nguyen 2012). Several studies and government reports have highlighted the problems of heavy borrowing, high default rates, and unmanageable debt among students who graduate from postsecondary education with a degree or credential (Choy and Li 2006;GAO 2009; Rothstein and Rouse 2011). 1 The analysis is limited to federal student loan debt because data on private borrowing are available only for the 2003-04 cohort and were provided by respondents. In contrast, administrative data on federal borrowing, which are more reliable than student-provided data, are available from the National Student Loan Data System for both cohorts. A key measure analyzed in the study is debt burden, defined as the ratio of borrowers' cumulative federal debt to their annual income, or total-federaldebt-to-annual-income ratio, 6 years after they first enrolled. The concept of debt-to-income ratio, referring to monthly loan repayments relative to monthly earnings, has been widely used in past research (Baum and Saunders 1998;Choy and Li 2006;Gladieux and Perna 2005). In contrast, the current study uses total federal student loan debt relative to annual income in order to capture debt burden for all borrowers. Although the total-federal-debt-toannual-income ratio used in this study has not, to our knowledge, been used in prior scholarship, we prefer it to other commonly used metrics for two reasons. Foremost, monthly loan payments can be zero under many circumstances, even when borrowers still owe. For example, borrowers may be in the 6-month grace period, have obtained a hardship deferment, be in forbearance, have defaulted, or now increasingly, be participating in the Income-Based Repayment program. In each of these cases, the monthly payment is zero, but the total loan remains to be repaid and usually continues to accrue interest. Second, the total-federal-debt-toannual-income ratio allows for the in- In addition, the specific total-federaldebt-to-annual-income ratio variable used here is also of value because one component-total federal debt-is derived from the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) and may therefore be more reliable than ratios created entirely from student-reported data, the typical source of monthly loan repayment information (Porter 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Students included in the analysis", "text": "are those who began postsecondary education in one of the four major institution sectors: public 4-year, public 2-year, private nonprofit 4-year, and for-profit institutions (at all levels). These students constitute all but 2-3 percent of beginning postsecondary students in the two cohorts (figure 1). 2 The four subgroups are analyzed separately because the price to attend different institutions and the income levels of students who attend them 2 Excluded students are those who start in public less-than-2-year institutions and private nonprofit less-than-4-year institutions; they constituted about 2.4 percent of 2003-04 beginning postsecondary students (Skomsvold, Radford, and Berkner 2011, Percentage distribution of beginning postsecondary students,  by type of first institution attended: 1995-96 and 2003-04 This approach does not take into account transfers, whose debt may be affected by transferring to a more or less expensive institution. Transfer primarily occurs between public 2-year and 4-year institutions; about onequarter of students who start in a public 2-year college transfer to a 4-year institution and among these transfers, about 44 percent complete a degree (Horn and Skomsvold 2011, tables 3-B and 5-B). The inclusion of transfers among students who start in public 2-year institutions will result in a slight underestimation of their cumulative debt. However, as this report shows, the percentage who borrow and the cumulative debt of public 2-year students is very low relative to their counterparts in the three other institution sectors analyzed."}, {"section_title": "INSTITUTION FIRST ATTENDED", "text": "Comparisons within sectors are made for the borrowing and debt variables previously discussed, completion status, and employment status. Small sample sizes precluded breaking out results for each sector by student characteristics. Similarly, small sample sizes precluded breaking out for-profit institutions into three levels, less-than-2-year, 2-year, and 4-year, which represent 6 percent, 4 percent, and 3 percent of BPS students, respectively (Berkner, He, and Cataldi 2002;Skomsvold, Radford, and Berkner 2011 ,   table 1). A student's degree program may also affect the amount of debt accrued. For example, a certificate program may be substantially shorter than an associate's degree program (Horn and Li 2009).     1 Includes less-than-2-year, 2-year, and 4-year institutions.
