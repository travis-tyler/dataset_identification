Ascorbic acid was added to the milkshake in all of these meals in an attempt to improve sensitivity for identifying an inhibiting effect.\nIt is widely believed that phytate is the factor responsible for the inhibitory effect of bran. In study 4 we examined this point in 10 normal subjects using four test meals containing different types of muffins ( Table 7) . Absorption averaged 2.43% with plain muffins (meal A) and only 0.99% with bran muffins (meal B). The absorption ratio with:without bran of 0.41 (t = 8.17, p < 0.0001) was almost identical to the ratio of 0.42 obtained for this ascorbic acid meal in study 2 despite the fact that absorption with plain muffins was much higher in that study (9.29%). These same subjects were then given two additional test meals containing muffins prepared with either LWB (meal C) or LDB (meal D); iron absorption averaged 1.29 and 1.37%, respec tively. These nearly identical values indicate that the phytate content of bran is not re sponsible for its inhibiting effect. When com pared to absorption from plain muffins, highly significant mean ratios with:without bran were observed: 0.53 for LWB (t = 3.19, p = 0.005) and 0.56 for LDB (t = 2.90, p = 0.009). When the meals containing LWB or LDB muffins were compared, the mean ratio WB:LWB of 0.77 was not significant (t = 1.36, p = 0.10), whereas the similar ratio WB: LDB of 0.73 was marginally significant (t = 2.18, p = 0.029). These results are consistent with a slight decrease in the inhibitory activity of bran due to lyophilization. In a final study, with 18 volunteers, we tried to determine whether the inhibitory ef fect of LDB was located in the soluble or insoluble fraction ( Table 7) . Absorption from the test meal with plain muffins averaged 3.0217r. and 2.23% with LDB muffins. The absorption ratio with:without bran of 0.74 did not reach statistical significance at the 5% level (t = 1.70, p = 0.053), in contrast with study 4 in which the ratio of 0.56 was statis tically significant. Failure to establish a sig nificant inhibition with LDB made it difficult to compare inhibition by insoluble and solu ble fractions of LDB, particularly because the total effect of 12 g bran was distributed be tween the two meals. Indeed, mean absorp tion with insoluble bran muffins was actually higher (3.22%) than with LDB. Of the two fractions studied, inhibition was greater with bran muffins for which absorption averaged 2.43'. The absorption ratio insol bran of 1.32 was statistically sig nificant (t = 2.41, p = 0.013).

These data are con to white wheat flour decreased iron absorp-sistent with those of Bjorn-Rasmussen but tion from baked rolls by a factor of two. He are not strictly comparable because of differ reported a significant linear relationship be-ences in the size of the meals and the amounts of added bran. Bjorn-Rasmussen did not examine the mechanism of the bran effect but he speculated that it was related to the phytate content of the bran. Morris and Ellis (,4) reported that over half of the iron in wheat bran is present as MFP, a compound that, in contrast to saturated ferric phytate, is soluble at neutral pH but insoluble at acid pH. In rats, this iron complex had high bioavailability (14) . In dogs, complete isotopic exchange of MFP with nonheme dietary iron was demonstrated (22) . In our study, this isotopic exchange was confirmed in human subjects given meals of both low (SS) and high (STD) iron availability. With both meals, iron absorptior. did not differ between MFP and FeCl:,.\nSince MFP accounts for less than 5%of the total phytate content of bran, the effect of bran phytate on iron absorption is more im- portant. Most workers report that phytate significantly inhibited iron absorption (20, 23-26), but others report that the effect of phytate on iron absorption was negligible (27) (28) (29) . Some discrepancies could be attrib uted to differences among species in the as similation of iron phytate, but often the in hibitory effect was studied only indirectly by adding purified phytate to food. We ap proached the question of the phytate effect on iron absorption directly by measuring the effect of phytate-free bran. This dephytinized bran produced the same degree of inhibition in iron absorption as whole bran did, indi cating that the iihibitory effect of bran should not be attributed to its phytate con tent. Reinhold et ai. (30) questioned the phytate theory as the sole explanation for bran inhi bition because purified phytate was less efLb EFFECT OF BRAN ON fective at decreasing zinc and calcium absorption than its equivalent of whole meal bread. Reinhold et al. (31) latter demonstrated in vitro that dephytinized whole meal bread bound bivalent metals at least as well as the original phytate-containing products and our data support thi! conclusion. In a later study (32), the binding of bivalent metals increased when bran was dephytinized and decreased when fiber was destroyed by hydrolysis in boiling acid: the authors concluded that fiber rather than phytate was primarily responsible for the inhibitory effect of bran on iron absorption. From a balance study in human subjects, Reinhold et al. (33) concluded that both fiber and phosphate bitid metals such as magnesium and zinc in a the small intestine and thereby impair their absorption. but they did not evaluate iron absorption. Other workers report that inorganic phosphate impairs iron absorption (34) (35) (36) .\nIn our study, we administered the fiberand phosphate-rich '.omponents of dephytinized bran separately in an attempt to identify the fraction that inhibits iron absorption. Chemical analysis dztermined that this separation was effective. The total phosphorus content was 13 mg in insoluble bran and 166 mg in soluble bran: neutral detergent fiber' was 4.6 g in insoluble bran and was undetectable in the soluble fraction. None of the lyophilized bran components inhibited iron absorption significantly, but inhibition was greater with soluble than with insoluble bran. suggesting that phosphate is more inhibitory than fiber.\nSeveral factors could account for our fail ure to clearly identify the bran fraction that inhibits iron absorption. In an effort to achieve high base-line absorption from which inhibition could be readily recognized, we chose a test meal that contained 100 mg ascorbic acid. However, the inhibitory effect of bran apparently was greater for meals without beef or ascorbic acid (ratio with:without bran. 0.26) than for meals with either beef or ascorbic acid (ratios, 0.49 and 0.42, respectively). Evaluation of the effects of difrom which iron is ab- sorbed at low levels is not always reliable because precision is low at levels of I to 2% absorption. However, our data suggest that the meals designed to achieve relatively high base-line absorption may have partly neu tralized the inhibitory effect under stud'.\nAnother possible explanation for the fail ure to establish a cause of the inhibitory effect of bran components relates to the lyophili zation process. With meals containing 100mg ascorbic acid the absorption ratios with:with out whole bran were 0.42 (meals D:C, study 2, Table 5 ) and 0.41 (meals B:A, study 4, Table 6 ) but the ratios with:without lyophi li.ed bran were 0.53 (meals C:A, study 4, Table 6 ) and 0.74 (meals B:A, study 5, Table  6 ). Lyophilization may have altered some component of bran and reduced its inhibitory effect. For example. bran fiber contains hem icellulose and cellulose, and these branched and long chain polysaccharides might have physical properties that are altered by freeze drying.\nUse of the double isotope technic has greatly enhanced the sensitivity of food iron absorption tests because multiple compari sons within individual subjects eliminate the problem of individual differences in absorp tion. Precision is enhanced when subjects eat test meals on several days, thus reducing the effect of day-to-day variability on iron aL, sorption. Even with these refiaements in methodology. however, the effect of a dietary variable that changes iron absorption by less than a factor of',wo. particularly if an inhib itorv effect, is still difficult to calculate. 0"}]
