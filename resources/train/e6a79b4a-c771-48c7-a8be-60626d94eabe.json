[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The amyloid cascade model of Alzheimer's disease posits the primacy of amyloid beta deposition preceding tau-mediated neurofibrillary tangle formation. The amyloid-tau-neurodegeneration biomarker-only diagnostic framework similarly requires the presence of amyloid beta for a diagnosis on the Alzheimer's continuum. However, medial temporal lobe tau pathology in the absence of amyloid beta is frequently observed at autopsy in cognitively normal individuals, a phenomenon that may reflect a consequence of aging and has been labelled 'primary age-related tauopathy'. Alternatively, others argue that this tauopathy reflects an early stage of the developmental continuum leading to Alzheimer's disease. We used positron emission tomography imaging to investigate amyloid beta and tau positivity and associations with cognition to better inform the conceptualization of biomarker changes in Alzheimer's pathogenesis. Five hundred twenty-three individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative who had undergone flortaucipir positron emission tomography imaging were selected to derive positron emission tomography positivity thresholds using conditional inference decision tree regression. A subsample of 301 individuals without dementia (i.e. those with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment) had also undergone florbetapir positron emission tomography imaging within 12 months and were categorized into one of the four groups based on cortical amyloid and Braak stage I/II tau positivity: A\u00c0/T\u00c0, A\u00fe/T\u00c0, A\u00c0/T\u00fe, or A\u00fe/T\u00fe. Tau positivity in the absence of amyloid beta positivity (i.e. A\u00c0/T\u00fe) comprised the largest group, representing 45% of the sample. In contrast, only 6% of the sample was identified as A\u00fe/T\u00c0, and the remainder of the sample fell into A\u00c0/T\u00c0 (22%) or A\u00fe/T\u00fe (27%) categories. A\u00c0/T\u00c0 and A\u00fe/T\u00c0 groups had the best cognitive performances across memory, language and executive function; the A\u00c0/T\u00fe group showed small-to-moderate relative decreases in cognition; and the A\u00fe/T\u00fe group had the worst cognitive performances. Furthermore, there were negative associations between Braak stage I/II tau values and all cognitive domains only in the A\u00c0/T\u00fe and A\u00fe/T\u00fe groups, with strongest associations for the A\u00fe/T\u00fe group. Among our sample of older adults across the Alzheimer's pathological spectrum, 7-fold fewer individuals have positron emission tomography evidence of amyloid beta pathology in the absence of tau pathology than the converse, challenging prevailing models of amyloid beta's primacy in Alzheimer's pathogenesis. Given that cognitive performance in the A\u00c0/T\u00fe group was poorer than in individuals without either pathology, our results suggest that medial temporal lobe tau without cortical amyloid beta may reflect an early stage on the Alzheimer's pathological continuum."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Amyloid beta (Ab) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles represent two of the original defining neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD; Alzheimer, 1907) . Although initially no distinction was made in the relative causal contributions of these two pathologies, the prevailing view of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis later shifted to an Ab-centric perspective that considered Ab to be the primary harbinger of the disease state, referred to as the amyloid cascade model (Glenner and Wong, 1984; Hardy, 2017) . The deterministic gene mutations for AD result in increased accumulation of the Ab protein (Blacker and Tanzi, 1998) and are generally regarded as confirmatory of the primacy of beta-amyloidosis in AD pathogenesis, although a study by Oxtoby et al. (2018) in early-onset familial AD gene mutation carriers demonstrated identical cortical PiB Ab and CSF p-tau abnormality rates. Furthermore, the recent failures of large-scale clinical trials targeting Ab have called into question the verity of the amyloid cascade model (Egan et al., 2018; Honig et al., 2018; Selkoe, 2019) . Consequently, the role of Ab as the primary driving force in the pathogenesis of AD has recently come under scrutiny (Ricciarelli and Fedele, 2017; Morris et al., 2018) .\nA recent re-conceptualization of the AD diagnostic framework has built upon the amyloid cascade hypothesis by proposing a biomarker characterization of the disease in terms of Ab pathology (A), tau pathology (T), and neurodegeneration (N), thus comprising the amyloid-tauneurodegeneration or 'AT(N)' framework (Jack et al., 2016 (Jack et al., , 2018a . Although this framework purports agnosticism with regard to the temporal emergence of abnormal biomarkers, it retains an Ab-centric perspective by necessitating that abnormal Ab must be present to constitute 'Alzheimer's pathologic change' (A\u00fe/T\u00c0), followed by a subsequent pathological change in tau that transitions the diagnosis to 'Alzheimer's disease' (A\u00fe/ T\u00fe). In contrast, tau in the absence of Ab (A\u00c0/T\u00fe), either with or without neurodegeneration, is labelled as 'non-Alzheimer's pathologic change' within this framework. Such nomenclature suggests that individuals in this category are not on the Alzheimer's continuum but rather on an alternative pathological trajectory (Burnham et al., 2016; Gordon et al., 2016; Mormino et al., 2016) . Controversy remains over the designation of tau in the absence of Ab as a non-Alzheimer's disease process, however, as some studies indicate that this group (A\u00c0/T\u00fe) is indistinguishable from Ab-positive groups on a host of purportedly 'non-Alzheimer's disease' clinical and biological factors (Knopman et al., 2013) .\nAnalogous to the AT(N) framework's 'non-Alzheimer's disease pathologic change' is the concept of primary agerelated tauopathy (PART), which postulates that medial temporal lobe (MTL) tau in the absence of Ab reflects a feature of aging separate from the Alzheimer's continuum that is 'observed in cognitively normal individuals', with 'severe PART' associated with amnestic changes only (Crary et al., 2014) . Similar controversy exists as to whether PART should be considered a distinct pathological entity (Crary, 2016; Bell et al., 2019) or whether it is better represented as an early Alzheimer's process given its phenomenological similarity to AD (Braak and Del Tredici, 2014; Duyckaerts et al., 2015) and evidence of cognitive decline despite the absence of Ab-positivity (Jefferson-George et al., 2017; Josephs et al., 2017) . Although PART has typically been studied using postmortem histopathology, recent advances in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging for tau (Jagust, 2018) now allow for in vivo investigation of MTL tau in the absence of Ab that can clarify the characteristics of PART and its separability from-or inclusion on-the Alzheimer's continuum.\nAccordingly, we examined the proportion of older adults without dementia [i.e. cognitively normal (CN) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI)] who had MTL tau in the absence of Ab (A\u00c0/T\u00fe) relative to individuals with Ab in the absence of tau (A\u00fe/T\u00c0), with the expectation that there will be a higher prevalence of A\u00c0/T\u00fe individuals based on the neuropathological staging studies of Del Tredici (2014, 2015) . Furthermore, given prior suggestions by Crary et al. (2014) that A\u00c0/T\u00fe represents a common feature of aging in primarily CN individuals (i.e. PART), we explored this notion by comparing the biomarker groupings on neuropsychological function. In concert with findings from Braak and colleagues, our results may have implications for the amyloid cascade hypothesis and AT(N) framework by indicating the need for the recognition of MTL tauopathy as a primary substrate of the Alzheimer's continuum or, at the very least, agnosticism regarding the temporal sequence of pathological events in AD."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Initially, data were assessed from 523 participants of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) who had flortaucipir data available to create tau standardized uptake variable ratio (SUVR) positivity thresholds. Of these 523 participants with available flortaucipir data, 350 participants also had available florbetapir data acquired within 12 months of the flortaucipir data to create Ab SUVR positivity thresholds. Subsequently, a subset of 301 individuals without dementia (i.e. CN and MCI) who had data from both PET measures acquired within 12 months of one another were included in analyses investigating the concurrence of Ab and tau positivity (i.e. A/T grouping) and subsequent group comparisons in clinical and cognitive characteristics."}, {"section_title": "Amyloid positron emission tomography processing", "text": "Processing methods for ADNI florbetapir ( 18 F-AV-45) data have been previously described (Landau et al., 2013; Landau and Jagust, 2015) .

Preprocessed PET images were co-registered with the individual's native-space structural magnetic resonance imaging that was collected within the closest proximity to the PET scan (typically 3 months or less) to obtain Freesurfer-defined regional standardized uptake variable values. A cortical summary measure was derived by calculating a volume-weighted average across frontal, cingulate, lateral parietal and lateral temporal regions. All SUVs were intensity normalized by dividing each value by the whole cerebellum to derive SUVRs, as recommended in ADNI's florbetapir processing methods (Landau and Jagust, 2015) . Although a positivity threshold of 1.11 is recommended for the intensity normalized cortical summary measure Landau and Jagust, 2015) , we derived a new threshold using the procedures described below to maintain methodological consistency with the derivation of a tau positivity threshold (see also below). Notably, florbetapir data were selected based on the acquisition date closest in time to the baseline flortaucipir scan acquisition date within a 12-month period. On average, acquisition of the florbetapir scan followed the flortaucipir scan by 0.54 months with an SD of 1.69 months in either direction."}, {"section_title": "Tau positron emission tomography processing", "text": "Processing methods for ADNI flortaucipir ( 18 F-AV-1451) data have been previously described Maass et al., 2017) .

Mini-Mental State Examination total score was used to drive the classification algorithm separately for both Ab and tau data to obtain thresholds that (i) are consistent between both Ab and tau PET data (i.e. to avoid an Ab threshold defined on pathologically confirmed diagnoses versus a tau threshold that is not validated in this way) and (ii) use a global cognitive measure independent from neuropsychological outcome variables used in later group comparisons. Analyses for each Braak composite stage were conducted in a hierarchical manner: first, thresholds were determined for Braak V/VI; individuals positive for Braak V/VI were then removed from subsequent analyses prior to the determination of Braak III/IV thresholds; and finally, following the removal of individuals positive for Braak III/IV, thresholds for Braak I/II were determined. Analyses were conducted in a single algorithm for Ab using the cortical summary measure, given the more spatially diffuse emergence of Ab deposits relative to the consistent hierarchical spatiotemporal progression of tau pathology. Thresholds were taken at the lowest bifurcation in the tree, unless otherwise noted; if two bifurcations were made at the same level, the threshold was instead taken from the level above. Importantly, unlike prior studies that have thresholded tau conditionally on Ab (Wang et al., 2016; Mishra et al., 2017; Jack et al., 2019) , thresholds for Ab and tau positivity were derived independently of the other to avoid bias in the prevalence estimates of A/T groups."}, {"section_title": "Diagnostic classification", "text": "Individuals with dementia were included only during derivation of the SUVR thresholds.

Participants' observed scores were compared with the predicted scores for a group of 'robust' CN participants (i.e. maintained CN status throughout the duration of their participation in ADNI) and standardized to create z-scores.

To assess the effect of using a newly derived Ab PET threshold, we additionally ran these analyses using the conventional 1.11 threshold for Ab.

In contrast, only 6% of the sample had evidence of Ab in the absence of tau (A\u00fe/T\u00c0), despite the use of equivalent methods for deriving positivity thresholds. The A\u00c0/T\u00fe group tended to perform more poorly across memory, executive function, and language domains relative to the A\u00c0/T\u00c0 and A\u00fe/T\u00c0 groups, although not as poorly as the A\u00fe/T\u00fe group. Only the A\u00c0/T\u00fe and A\u00fe/T\u00fe groups exhibited associations between tau SUVR levels and all cognitive domains, with stronger effects observed for the A\u00fe/T\u00fe group. Importantly, our results provide preliminary evidence to suggest that tau pathology may emerge independent of beta-amyloidosis and that A\u00c0/T\u00fe individuals, given their widespread early cognitive compromises, may be best represented on the Alzheimer's continuum. These findings are critically important in the conceptualization and treatment of AD because they suggest a wider spectrum of individuals as part of the AD prodrome, as well as provide further evidence that tau represents a relevant and promising treatment target for Alzheimer's disease.\nAlthough there has been a recent surge of research utilizing tau PET imaging in the context of Alzheimer's disease, many studies have focused on tau only in the presence of Ab, rather than assessing them independently (Vemuri et al., 2016; Bejanin et al., 2017; Ossenkoppele et al., 2019a,b) . In addition, positivity for tau PET is often determined conditionally based on Ab (Wang et al., 2016; Mishra et al., 2017; Jack et al., 2019) . Importantly, this strategy obviates the possibility of assessing discordance between Ab and tau positivities and offers incomplete conclusions about the respective roles of these pathologies in the Alzheimer's disease clinical continuum. It is for this reason that we derived thresholds for Ab and tau independently of one another and independent of our clinical and cognitive outcome variables, by using Mini-Mental State Examination as a global index of cognition to drive the classification algorithm. This process yielded tau positivity thresholds that were similar to, albeit more conservative than, those previously reported using analogous methods in a more heterogeneous sample (Sch\u00f6 ll et al., 2016; Maass et al., 2017) , providing convergent validity for the values derived in this study. Notably, although the value we derived for the Ab positivity threshold (>1.14) was slightly more liberal than the conventional threshold using pathologically confirmed data (>1.11; Landau and Jagust, 2015) , a reanalysis of the data with the conventional 1.11 threshold revealed that group classifications remained largely the same (see Supplementary Table 1) and cognitive comparisons did not notably differ from the results reported above. Thus, we believe that the methods used for threshold derivation in this study provide valid and reliable biomarker categorizations. Applying these newly derived positivity thresholds to examine discrepancies in Ab and tau positivity, we found that the A\u00c0/T\u00fe group represented the largest proportion of the sample (45%), whereas more than a 7-fold lower proportion (6%) were categorized as A\u00fe/T\u00c0. Notably, these proportions differ substantially from a recent study of AT(N) categorizations, which found only 11.5% to be classified as A\u00c0/T\u00fe/(N\u00c0 or \u00fe) using PET methods . Importantly, this prior study derived a threshold for tau positivity that was contingent on Ab status, with the tau SUVR threshold determined based on optimal discriminability of young CN A\u00c0 individuals from older cognitively impaired A\u00fe individuals. Using a model based on discrimination of A\u00c0 and A\u00fe groups necessarily yields a threshold value that will maximally group high tau SUVRs with the A\u00fe category and low tau SUVRs with the A\u00c0 category, thus increasing the likelihood of producing A\u00fe/T\u00fe and A\u00c0/T\u00c0 groups with fewer individuals falling into discrepant groups. We, in contrast, derived A\u00fe and T\u00fe threshold independently of one another by fitting our model to a global cognitive outcome regardless of PET status for the other biomarker to reduce bias.\nOur resultant classifications of 45% A\u00c0/T\u00fe and 6% A\u00fe/T\u00c0 differ from the temporal sequence of pathological events anticipated by the amyloid cascade model and AT(N) framework, both of which purport that Ab is the primary pathological substrate of Alzheimer's disease that emerges some years prior to the tauopathy of Alzheimer's disease. However, post-mortem histopathological studies of Alzheimer's disease have indicated early pathological tau changes that occur in the brainstem, specifically the locus coeruleus, which subsequently propagate to medial temporal regions encompassing Braak stage I/II. These events largely occur before the evidence of Ab accumulation (Braak et al., 2011; Braak and Del Tredici, 2015; Ehrenberg et al., 2017) , in accord with the high proportion of A\u00c0/T\u00fe observed in our study. Furthermore, our findings of a high prevalence of T\u00fe in the context of A\u00c0 comport with the post-mortem pathological findings of Braak and Del Tredici (2015) . In their study, $75-80% of individuals aged 70-80 years had evidence of Braak stages I-II tau pathology, whereas only $10-35% over that same age range had evidence of Ab phases 1-3 (note that the average age of our study participants was 75.6 years). Moreover, across all ages, 953 (61%) of the autopsied subjects with Braak stage I/II tau pathology had Ab phase 0 pathology. In a separate study, Braak and Del Tredici (2014) further demonstrated that, of the 80% of individuals between the ages of 70-80 years with neuropathological evidence of Braak stages I-II tau pathology, only half also had evidence of Ab (including phase 1), which again aligns with our findings of 45% A\u00c0/T\u00fe prevalence.\nPrior research has acknowledged this group of A\u00c0/T\u00fe individuals, although historically they have not been considered part of the Alzheimer's developmental continuum. Instead, individuals with this pathological presentation of MTL tau in the absence of Ab have been relegated to alternative categorizations such as PART, which views medial temporal tauopathy in the absence of Ab as a feature of aging separate from AD (Crary et al., 2014; Jellinger et al., 2015) . Individuals under the PART designation have been characterized as older, having lower APOE e4 allelic frequencies, and typically more cognitively intact with only localized amnestic changes observed in severe cases (Crary et al., 2014) . However, other groups contend that PART itself is a developmental stage (i.e. Braak I/II) of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis (Braak and Del Tredici, 2014; Duyckaerts et al., 2015; Josephs et al., 2017) . Most investigations into PART have been conducted using post-mortem histopathological data, which limits the ability to assess cognitive status in close temporal proximity to the pathological determinants due to the use of retrospective cognitive data that often varies on the order of years in its proximity to the time of autopsy. In contrast, our study was able to investigate these groupings using in vivo PET markers of Ab and tau pathology that more closely coincided with the administration of a neuropsychological battery, allowing for an improved cognitive characterization of A\u00c0/T\u00fe individuals. Importantly, our results do not recapitulate the usual demographic and clinical features of the A\u00c0/T\u00fe group proposed by proponents of PART (Crary et al., 2014) . For example, our A\u00c0/T\u00fe group did not differ from the non-pathological A\u00c0/T\u00c0 group in terms of APOE e4 allelic frequency. Furthermore, although the A\u00c0/T\u00fe group was older than the A\u00c0/T\u00c0 group, they did not differ from the other groups (A\u00fe/T\u00c0 and A\u00fe/T\u00fe). Notably, vascular risk assessed through multiple indices did not differ between the groups and therefore any group differences in cognition are likely not attributable to vascular differences. The proportion of individuals with MCI did not differ among the A\u00c0/T\u00c0, A\u00c0/T\u00fe and A\u00fe/T\u00c0 groups (21-24%), but it was twice as high in the A\u00fe/T\u00fe group (48%). Significantly, the A\u00c0/T\u00fe group had an MCI rate of 24%, which conflicts with the claim that PART is a condition observed primarily in CN individuals (Crary et al., 2014) . However, given that this rate did not statistically differ from the A\u00c0/T\u00c0 group, we also examined differences in neuropsychological domain scores to further explore the pattern of cognitive performance across groups.\nFrom the amyloid cascade and PART perspectives, one would predict similar cognitive performances between the A\u00c0/T\u00c0 and A\u00c0/T\u00fe groups, particularly in non-amnestic domains, followed by a lower-performing A\u00fe/T\u00c0 group, followed by the lowest-performing A\u00fe/T\u00fe group. This pattern was not observed across any of the three cognitive domains. Instead, the A\u00c0/T\u00c0 and A\u00fe/T\u00c0 groups performed most similarly, often with the A\u00fe/T\u00c0 group demonstrating the best performances of all groups. In contrast, the A\u00c0/T\u00fe group exhibited small-to-moderate decreases in performance relative to the A\u00c0/T\u00c0 group across all domains. The A\u00fe/T\u00fe group had the poorest performances in all domains with the exception of language, for which the A\u00c0/T\u00fe group performed equally as poorly. Furthermore, examination of partial correlations between domain performance and Braak stage I/II SUVR levels revealed associations only for the A\u00c0/T\u00fe and A\u00fe/ T\u00fe groups, with stronger effects for the latter. Despite its confinement to the MTL in Braak stage I/II, tau appears to have widespread effects on cognition across memory, executive, and language domains, even in the absence of Ab positivity. The cognitive differences and associations in executive and language domains in the A\u00c0/T\u00fe group are particularly noteworthy given that PART purports to impart only amnestic cognitive changes in the most severe cases. Thus, tau appears to be exerting deleterious effects on cognition within the MTL and beyond even in A\u00c0 individuals, possibly through network changes to broader association cortices associated with language and executive functions (Ossenkoppele et al., 2019a,b) . Notably, the reported effect sizes for group differences in cognition are relatively small and the conclusions drawn should be interpreted cautiously in the absence of further longitudinal research. Nevertheless, these preliminary findings suggest that MTL tau pathology in the absence of Ab may not be an anticipated consequence of aging, as the PART hypothesis implies.\nGiven these findings, we propose that prominent MTL tau pathology itself is sufficient to be considered part of the Alzheimer's continuum, rather than the distinct entity of PART, with subsequent beta-amyloidosis accelerating the disease stage. These data indicate that a revision to the AT(N) nomenclature (Jack et al., 2016 (Jack et al., , 2018a is also warranted such that A\u00c0/T\u00fe profiles should fall under the category of 'Alzheimer's pathologic change' rather than 'non-Alzheimer's pathologic change,' with the term 'Alzheimer's disease' reserved for A\u00fe/T\u00fe. If an individual falls into one of these categories in the context of intact cognition, they would be considered in a preclinical stage (i.e. preclinical Alzheimer's pathologic change or preclinical Alzheimer's disease; see Fig. 4 ). Interestingly, a prior study investigating the prevalence of abnormal biomarkers without regard to their temporal ordering noted that neurodegeneration (possibly due to MTL tau pathology) was more likely to be the first abnormal biomarker than Ab (Edmonds et al., 2015) ; perhaps the most appropriate staging model for Alzheimer's pathology would follow this 'tally' system to maintain agnosticism with regard to the temporal emergence of these biomarkers, given the continued uncertainty over the developmental cascade leading to AD. Such a reframing in nosology would also have critical implications for drug discovery and clinical trials. As our findings suggest, waiting for Ab positivity to become evident before attempting its clearance, particularly in those with MTL tau positivity, would negate the opportunity to clear pathological tau before it begins to affect cognition broadly across memory, language and executive functions.\nPrevailing theory postulates that tau pathology migrates from the brainstem to the MTL as part of the aging process and remains in this region until sufficient Ab pathology has accumulated to drive it out to adjacent neocortical regions (Bennett et al., 2017) . Our data showed that within the A\u00c0/T\u00fe group, all of whom were Braak stage I/II\u00fe (i.e. confined to MTL), 18 individuals (13% of the A\u00c0/T\u00fe group) were also Braak stage III/ IV\u00fe despite their Ab negativity. These data suggest that, in some cases, tau pathology may extend beyond the MTL independent of the influence of Ab. Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether Ab is needed to further the spread of tau beyond the MTL and the literature offers conflicting evidence. On the one hand, several studies have demonstrated that tau accumulates at a faster rate in the presence of Ab Jack et al., 2018b; Leal et al., 2018; Schultz et al., 2018) and our results indicated a stronger association between tau and cognitive performance, as well as generally poorer performance, in the A\u00fe/T\u00fe group relative to the A\u00c0/T\u00fe group. On the other hand, other studies show that tau has the ability to spread beyond the MTL to adjacent cortical regions in the absence of Ab, both in animal models (Kaufman et al., 2018) and human PET studies (Lowe et al., 2018) . Further post-mortem evidence demonstrates the continued progression of tau pathology despite the enduring clearance of Ab from anti-Ab therapies administered prior to death, suggesting an Ab-independent mechanism of tau propagation (Nicoll et al., 2019) .\nNotably, there are several other pathologies in addition to Ab and tau that comprise the Alzheimer's syndrome, and the majority of individuals with Alzheimer's disease have multiple pathologies (Schneider et al., 2009; Boyle et al., 2018) . Cerebrovascular pathology has proven to be a prominent and early contributor to Alzheimer's processes, with neuroimaging markers of small-vessel disease emerging as early as 22 years prior to symptom onset in autosomaldominant AD (Lee et al., 2016) . Data further indicate synergistic interactions between cerebrovascular pathology and hallmark Alzheimer's pathologies, such that cerebrovascular dysfunction may accelerate Ab and tau pathological progression, and vice versa (Blair et al., 2015; Nation et al., 2015; Rabin et al., 2019) . Another important pathological feature in older adults is TDP-43, which defines the new conceptualization of limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (i.e. LATE; Nelson et al., 2019) and is often comorbid with Ab and tau pathologies (James et al., 2016) . As research progresses, a polypathologic staging scheme for AD that extends beyond Ab and tau may be warranted. As previously suggested, a 'tally' system for these multiple pathologies (which also includes the presence of subtle or mild cognitive declines) may be the best nosology for representing their cumulative contributions to the Alzheimer's dementia syndrome (see Edmonds et al., 2015) .\nThere are several notable strengths of the current study. First, the measurement of Ab and tau positivity with PET imaging allowed for perhaps the first in vivo investigation of PART, with improved temporal proximity between the assessment of cognition and the measurement of pathology relative to previous post-mortem studies. The independent derivation of positivity thresholds for Ab and tau is also a unique feature of our study relative to prior studies and ensured any potential A\u00c0/T\u00fe individuals could accurately be detected, given that Ab positivity was not considered in the determination of T\u00c0 and T\u00fe groups. Furthermore, the use of neuropsychological measures sensitive to early AD provided a multi-domain assessment of cognition, rather than relying on brief cognitive screening or rating measures insensitive to the AD prodrome and not validated outside of clinic settings (see De Roeck et al., 2019 for a review). These methodological strengths allowed for an improved examination of the concept of PART, leading to the conclusion that this A\u00c0/T\u00fe pathological profile has deleterious effects on cognition and may be better considered as a stage of the Alzheimer's continuum.\nDespite its strengths, we also acknowledge that this study is not without its limitations. Importantly, the homogeneity of the ADNI sample may limit generalizability to more representative community-based samples and further studies sampling from a diverse population are needed to ensure that these effects persist among individuals of underrepresented races/ethnicities, socioeconomic strata and comorbid medical or mental health conditions. Furthermore, our study's cross-sectional analyses limited our ability to directly examine within-subject temporal emergence of Ab and tau pathologies as well as cognitive change over time across the A/T groups, and longitudinal investigations of such phenomena will be an important next step to corroborate the preliminary findings presented in this study and further our understanding of pathological progression along the Alzheimer's continuum within individuals over time. It is also noteworthy that the florbetapir PET tracer for Ab has a high affinity for neuritic plaques, but it may not detect diffuse plaques or soluble oligomers (Beach et al., 2014) ; thus, we cannot rule out that these other forms of Ab pathology are present in A\u00c0 individuals and contribute to neurofibrillary tangle formation (Koss et al., 2016; Abner et al., 2018) . That said, proponents of PART allow for the presence of diffuse plaques in addition to MTL tau (Crary et al., 2014) and, therefore, the detection of these diffuse plaques would not change the categorization of this group.\nOne may also question the decision to restrict the definition of tau positivity based on spatial location (i.e. MTL) while instead using a broader cortical summary measure for Ab positivity. Importantly, the use of a composite across diffuse cortical regions may dilute sensitivity of the detection of pathology in any single region. However, given that Ab pathology presents diffusely and variably throughout cortex (Braak and Braak, 1995; Lockhart et al., 2017) , a composite region may better capture the presence of this accumulated pathology given that measurement of a single region may produce false negatives if Ab has instead accumulated in other unsampled cortical regions. Conversely, tau pathology emerges in a specific spatiotemporal sequence across the Alzheimer's continuum (Braak and Braak, 1991) , which increases our sensitivity for the detection of tau pathology if we select these regions predicted by neuropathological staging (e.g. MTL regions for early detection). For this reason, we and other representative PET studies (see Maass et al., 2017 ) have determined tau positivity based on SUVR level within the MTL (i.e. Braak stage I/II). Notably, selection of this approach likely contributed to our relatively high prevalence of T\u00fe within this study (Braak et al., 2011) , whereas a composite of Braak stages I-IV would be more conservative in detecting T\u00fe. However, given that we observed subtle cognitive deficits among A\u00c0/T\u00fe individuals (with tau largely confined to the MTL), this finding suggests that the observed highly prevalent MTL tau in the absence of amyloid is an important pathological grouping that may be considered part of the Alzheimer's continuum rather than a feature of normal aging.\nThat said, other approaches to thresholding or staging of tau PET are worth considering and may yield different prevalence rates of A\u00c0/T\u00fe. For example, one study derived a composite summary measure, which included four regions that maximally separated low and high levels of flortaucipir binding, and proceeded to define a positivity threshold based on discrimination of Ab\u00c0 and Ab\u00fe older adults (Mishra et al., 2017) . Another approach taken by Ossenkoppele et al. (2018) selected regions of interest across Braak stages I-IV and defined a positivity threshold that was 2 SD above the mean for cognitively healthy older adults. We recognize that selection of a thresholding approach is highly influential to the resultant positivity groupings and, therefore, future studies investigating alternative methods for the determination of PET positivity and resultant A/T groupings are critically needed to inform our understanding of pathological changes along the Alzheimer's disease continuum. However, regardless of the selection of regions or thresholding method, we believe that it important to determine tau positivity independently of Ab, given the emerging early and independent role of tau within the Alzheimer's disease prodrome (JeffersonGeorge et al., 2017; Aschenbrenner et al., 2018; Nicoll et al., 2019) .\nIn summary, our analyses of PET data within the ADNI cohort suggest that tau pathology is common among individuals without significant beta-amyloidosis, given that 45% of the sample was categorized as A\u00c0/T\u00fe relative to 6% as A\u00fe/T\u00c0, contrary to prevailing amyloid cascade and AT(N) frameworks. Furthermore, the relatively poor cognitive performances of the A\u00c0/T\u00fe group, as well as the associations between Braak I/II tau levels and cognition in this group, support the notion that tau pathology confined to the MTL and, in the absence of Ab, may be part of the Alzheimer's developmental cascade rather than a feature of aging with few-to-no circumscribed cognitive deficits (i.e. PART). Future studies using longitudinal PET and cognitive data will provide an improved characterization of cognitive change within these A/T groups and better profile how they may transition over time. If realized, this work will lead to a better understanding of the respective spatiotemporal relationships between Ab and tau in the AD prodrome and offer important implications for person-specific interventions in future anti-Ab and anti-tau treatment efforts."}, {"section_title": "Supplementary material", "text": "Supplementary material is available at Brain Communications online."}]
