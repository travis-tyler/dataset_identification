[{"section_title": "", "text": "fects on school success, this second report in this series explores how maternal and family risks impact early school absenteeism. Using data from a nationally representative sample of kindergartners from across various incomes and race/ethnicity groups -the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (Kindergarten Cohort) 7 , NCCP examines the prevalence of risk factors known to threaten young children's healthy development and early school success. These include: poverty, teenage and/or single parenting, low levels of maternal education, receipt of welfare, unemployment, poor maternal health, food insecurity, and large family size -that is, four or more children at home. It also assesses the cumulative impact of early exposure to multiple risk factors, building on a large body of research showing that the more demographic and psycho-social risks children encounter, the more likely they are to experience poor developmental and school outcomes. 8 This report shows that maternal and family risks are associated with greater absenteeism and that the cumulative exposure to risk best predicts chronic absenteeism in early schooling. Kindergartners in contact with three or more risks missed, on average, three or more days than their peers not facing any risks. But as children progress through the elementary grades, the impact of cumulative risk on school attendance lessens, only to rise again in the fifth grade. This report also reveals that it is the most vulnerable children -that is, those who are poor or racial/ethnic minorities or suffer from poor health -who have the greatest exposure to cumulative risk."}, {"section_title": "How Prevalent are Maternal and Family Risks among U.S. Elementary School Children?", "text": "The maternal and family risks most commonly encountered by U.S. kindergartners include living with a single mother (19 percent), below the Federal Poverty Level (FPL, 18 percent), 9 in a large family (14 percent), or with a mother who had not completed high school (12 percent). The least frequent risks were being born to a teenage mother (4 percent) or living with an unemployed mother (4.5 percent). These risks, however, were more persistent among the most vulnerable children -that is, those who were poor, racial/ethnic minorities, or suffered from poor health. Children living in poverty, and to some extent low income children -that is, between 100 and 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level -were more likely than their higher income counterparts to  Poverty experience maternal and family risks. Consistently, the lower the income-to-needs ratio, the higher the incidence of maternal and family risk. 10 Some risks appeared to be more dependent than others on income-to-needs variations: thus, for every affluent kindergartner -that is, living at 300 percent of, or above the Federal Poverty Level -who experienced each of the following risks, 30 poor children experienced food insecurity at home; 11 20 had a mother with low education; 15 had an unemployed mother; nine were born to a teenage mother; seven lived with a single mother; six had a mother with poor health; and five lived in a family with four or more children. Nonwhite children consistently experienced greater risks than their white counterparts. 12 Black children encountered more risks than did Hispanic children, except for low maternal education, which was more common among the latter than among the former. Differences in risk exposure between black and Hispanic children were the greatest regarding welfare receipt, low maternal education, and single mother status, and were almost negligible with all other risk factors. Thus, for every white kindergartner experiencing each of the following risks, six black and four Hispanic children had mothers on welfare; four black and two Hispanic children lived with a single mother; and three black and six Hispanic children had a mother with low education. For every white kindergartner who experienced each of the following risks, five children of each nonwhite group lived in poverty; three faced food insecurity at home; three were born to a teenage mother; two had a mother with poor health; and two lived in families with a large number of children. Kindergartners with poor health were more likely to encounter more risks than their healthy peers. 13 For every healthy child experiencing each of the following risks, four unhealthy children had a mother with poor health; three had a mother with low education or on welfare; three encountered food insecurity at home; and two lived in poverty. Variations by child health status in exposure to other risks were not significant."}, {"section_title": "How Do Individual Risk Factors Relate to Early Chronic Absenteeism?", "text": "Absenteeism patterns in the elementary grades appeared to be related to a variety of maternal and family risks. Children exposed to poverty; to mothers who were teenagers at birth of the child, single, with less than a high school credential, on welfare, unemployed, or with poor health; or to households with four or more minors or with food insecurity, missed a greater number of school days than their peers who did not experience these risks. 14 Differences in absences comparing each individual risk, in general, were small, with poverty resulting in four extra days of absenteeism in kindergarten, on average, and food insecurity and welfare receipt resulting in 2.5 additional days of absenteeism in the same grade. These differences were the highest in this grade, and decreased steadily through third grade, reflecting increases in overall attendance observed in early elementary schooling, only to rise again, even if slightly, in fifth grade. These aggregate patterns, however, mask the existence of very different groups of children in terms of their absenteeism patterns: despite attendance improvements observed between kindergarten and third grade, in every grade children experiencing any risk were more often chronic absentees -that is, they missed 10 percent or more of the school year -than those who did not encounter any risks. The ratio of chronic absentees with risks to those without risk was the highest in kindergarten and decreased from this grade to third grade, but increased again in fifth grade."}, {"section_title": "Poverty", "text": "Across grades, children living in families below the Federal Poverty Level missed, on average, slightly over one day more than their non-poor peers.

The proportion of children encountering three or more risks diminished over the grades, reaching 9 percent in fifth grade. 25 Poor and low income children were more likely than their more affluent peers to encounter high risk throughout their elementary school lives. Sixty-five percent of poor kindergartners faced three or more risks, compared to 9 percent of low income, 7 percent of middle income, and less than 1 percent of affluent peers -that is, living at 300 percent or above of the Federal Poverty Level. 26 In all income groups, exposure to high risk diminished over the elementary grades. However, the gap between poor and affluent children in high risk exposure widened over time: for every affluent kindergartner facing three or more risks, there were 150 poor peers facing the same high level of cumulative risk. This ratio almost doubled by the fifth grade. On average, black and Hispanic children were, respectively, five and four times more likely than their white peers to be exposed to three or more risks. 27 In kindergarten, 6 percent of white children faced high cumulative risk, compared to almost two-fifths of black children and over one-fourth of Hispanic children. Children whose health was poor as reported by parents were three times more likely than their healthy peers to experience three or more risks. 28 Among kindergartners, over one-third of children with poor health were exposed to high risk, compared to 13 percent of their healthy counterparts. The cumulative experience of risks, rather than the additive effect of each individual risk, was related to chronic absenteeism in the elementary school. In general, the greater the exposure to cumulative risk, the greater the absenteeism. Regardless of income-and race/ethnicitybased differences in absenteeism, kindergartners with three or more risks averaged almost three more absences than their peers not exposed to any risk. This difference decreased to two and less than one day, on average, in first and third grade, and rose to over one day in fifth grade. Except for kindergarten, in all other grades the relation between cumulative risk and absenteeism was explained by the association between cumulative risk and children's absenteeism in previous grades. Thus, in first grade, differences in absenteeism by cumulative risk disappeared once absenteeism rates in kindergarten were taken into account. In third grade, the relation between absenteeism and cumulative risk appeared to rest on the association between the latter and absenteeism in first grade, specifically being a chronic absentee in this grade. In fifth grade, in turn, differences in absenteeism by cumulative risk were accounted for by the association between the latter and absenteeism in third and first grades, as well as in kindergarten. 29 Children with three or more risks were more likely than their peers without any risks to miss 10 percent or more of the school year. In kindergarten, 21 percent of children with 3 or more risks were chronic absentees, compared to 5 percent of children without risks. This proportion decreased in both first and third grades, only to increase slightly in fifth grade. 30 The greater the exposure to cumulative risk, the greater the absenteeism "}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This report calls attention to the detrimental impact that poverty and other forms of maternal and family risk have, both singly but particularly in combination, on children's early formal education experiences. Findings presented here are consistent with research indicating that it is the cumulative exposure to risk, rather than the additive effect of individual risks, that impacts on children's outcomes. 31 Like previous studies, this report suggests that children may be able to manage and tolerate the exposure to up to two risks without facing negative consequences for their learning and development. 32 However, an increase in exposure from two to three risks appears to be associated with significant problems, specifically in our study, with chronic absenteeism. The first report in this series ascertained the detrimental effects of chronic absenteeism on academic performance, particularly in kindergarten, when important foundations for future learning and development are established, particularly cognitive and socio-emotional skills and dispositions, as well as an understanding of the student role. The second installment in this series, this report points to the greater likelihood of children exposed to high risk to miss out on a significant part of their schooling experience, thereby compromising the acquisition of these foundational skills and dispositions. It also illustrates the progression of the relation between risk and absenteeism in elementary schooling: as children move through the elementary grades, the impact of cumulative risk on school attendance lessens, only to rise again in the fifth grade, possibly as a result of the greater absenteeism observed in transitional grades, namely kindergarten and fifth grade. 33 Consistent with existing research, this report also finds children vulnerable by virtue of their poverty, racial/ethnic minority, and poor health status to experience greater risk than their affluent, white, and healthy peers. 34 Individual risks examined here tended to co-occur in the population studied. Some of these risks -for instance, maternal education -have two-generational implications in that they constitute risks for both children's development and maternal employment. 35 The findings presented here point to the urgency to identify and provide supports to vulnerable children early in their formal schooling careers in order to steer them toward successful early learning trajectories. They also highlight the need to examine how protective factors -that is, resources, skills, and abilities of parents, families and communities -can help strengthen children's resiliency in the context of high risk exposure, 36 and contribute to early school success."}]
