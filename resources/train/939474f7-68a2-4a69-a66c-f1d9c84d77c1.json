Regression models have been widely investigated to predict cognitive outcomes using morphometric measures extracted from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans (e.g., [27] ). Such studies can improve the understanding of the neuroanatomical basis of cognitive impairments, but are not designed to directly impact clinical practice. To bridge this gap, here we propose a new learning paradigm which ranks cognitive assessments according to their relevance to AD using brain MRI data.\nCognitive assessments provide the most common clinical routine for the diagnosis of AD. Given a large number of cognitive assessment tools and a time-limited office visit, determining a proper set of cognitive tests is a widely studied topic. Most existing studies aim to create selection guidelines for a targeted population [21] . In this work, we propose a novel learning paradigm that embraces the concept of precision medicine and tailors the cognitive test selection process to the individual characteristics of a given patient. Specifically, we perform an innovative application of a newly developed learning-to-rank method, denoted as PLTR [9] , to the structural MRI and cognitive assessment data of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort [25] . Using structural MRI measures as the individual characteristics, we aim to not only identify individual-specific cognitive biomarkers but also prioritize them and their corresponding assessment tasks according to AD-specific abnormality.\nThe uniqueness of our study is twofold. First, traditional regression-based studies for prediction of cognitive performances from MRI data focus on identifying relevant imaging biomarkers at the population level. The proposed new model aims to identify AD-relevant cognitive biomarkers tailored to each individual patient. Second, the identified cognitive biomarkers and assessments are prioritized based on the individual's brain characteristics, which can be used to guide the determination of cognitive assessments in a personalized fashion in clinical practice. It has the potential to enable personalized diagnosis and disease subtyping."}, {"section_title": "LITERATURE REVIEW 2.1 Learning to Rank", "text": "Learning to Rank (LETOR) [16] is a popular technique used in recommender systems [10] , web search [2] and information retrieval [12] . Existing LETOR methods can be roughly classified into three categories [17] . The first category is pointwise methods [6] , in which a score function is learned to score individual instance, and then instances are sorted/ranked based on their scores. The second category is pairwise methods [5] , which maximize the number of correctly ordered pairs to learn the ranking structure among instances. The last category is listwise methods [11] , in which a ranking function is learned to explicitly model the entire ranking. Generally, pairwise and listwise methods have superior performance over pointwise methods due to their ability to leverage order structure among instances in learning [17] . Recently, LETOR has also been used in drug discovery and drug selection [13] [14] [15] 28] . For example, Agarwal et al. [1] developed a bipartite ranking method to prioritize compounds. He et al. [9] developed a joint push and learning to rank method to select cancer drugs to patients.

[9] , denoted as PLTR, for personalized cognitive feature prioritization. Our goal is to prioritize cognitive features for each patient that are most relevant to his/her disease diagnosis using patients' brain morphometric measures extracted from their MRI scans. In specific, the cognitive features are in the form of scores or answers from cognitive tasks that the patients take. The prioritization result can potentially be used in clinical practice to recommend the most relevant cognitive features or tasks that can most effectively help diagnosis of an individual.\nIn the context of MCI/AD cognitive feature prioritization, PLTR learns and uses latent vectors of patients and their imaging features to score each cognitive feature for each patient, and ranks the cognitive features based on their scores; patients with similar imaging feature profiles will have similar latent vectors. During the learning process, PLTR explicitly pushes the most relevant cognitive features on top of the less relevant ones for each patient, and therefore optimizes the latent patient and cognitive feature vectors so they will reproduce the pushed ranking structures. In PLTR, such latent vectors are learned by solving the following optimization problem:\nwhere U = [u 1 , u 2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , u m ] and V = [v 1 , v 2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , v n ] are the latent vector matrices for patients and features, respectively; L s is the overall loss function; and P \u2191 s measures the average number of relevant cognitive features that are ranked below an irrelevant cognitive feature, defined as follows,\nwhere m is the number of patients, f + j and f \u2212 i are the relevant and irrelevant features of patient Pp , n + p and n \u2212 p are their respective numbers, and I(x) is the indicator function (I(x) = 1 if x is true, otherwise 0).

However, in some cases, the score of relevant features is expected to be higher than that of less relevant features by a large margin.

In order to incorporate such information, we propose a hinge loss based PLTR, denoted as PLTR h . In PLTR h , the overall loss function is very similar to Equation 1, defined as follows,\nwhere L h is the overall loss function; U , V , R u and R csim are identical as those in Equation 1.

PLTR h achieves similar performance as PLTR, and identifies on average 2.599 most relevant groundtruth cognitive features on its top-5 predictions (i.e., QH@5=2.599). PLTR and PLTR h significantly outperform the baseline methods in terms of all the evaluation metrics on cognitive feature level (i.e., QH@5 and WQH@5). Specifically, PLTR outperforms the best baseline method BMTMKL at 9.1% and 22.1% on QH@5 and WQH@5, respectively. PLTR h also outperforms BMTMKL at 6.4% and 19.2% on QH@5 and WQH@5, respectively. These experimental results demonstrate that among the top 5 features in the ranking list, PLTR and PLTR h are able to rank more relevant features on top than the two strong baseline methods and the positions of those hits are also higher than those in the baseline methods.\n7.1.2 Comparison on cognitive task level. For the scenario to prioritize cognitive tasks that each patient should take, PLTR and PLTR h are able to identify the top-1 most relevant task for 72.5% and 74.3% of all the patients when using 3 features to score cognitive tasks, respectively (i.e., NH 3 =0.725 for PLTR and NH 3 =0.743 for PLTR h ). This indicates the strong power of PLTR and PLTR h in prioritizing cognitive features and in recommending relevant cognition tasks for real clinical applications. We also find that PLTR and PLTR h are able to outperform baseline methods on most of the metrics on cognitive task level (i.e., NH @1). PLTR outperforms the best of baseline methods BMTMKL at 11.6%, 16.7% and 14.2% on NH 1 @1, NH 2 @1 and NH 3 @1, respectively. PLTR h performs even better than PLTR on NH 1 @1 and NH 3 @1, in addition to that it outperforms the best performance of baseline methods at 13.7%, 14.7% and 17.0% on NH 1 @1, NH 2 @1 and NH 3 @1, respectively. PLTR and PLTR h perform slightly worse than baseline methods on NH 5 @1 and NH all @1 (0.760 vs 0.784 on NH 5 @1 and 0.707 vs 0.760 on NH all @1). These experimental results indicate that PLTR and PLTR h are able to push the most relevant task to the top of the ranking list than baseline methods when using a small number of features to score cognitive tasks. Note that in CV, each patient has only a few cognitive tasks in the testing set. Therefore, we only consider the evaluation at the top task in the predicted task rankings (i.e., only NH @1 in Table 1 ). Table 1 also shows that PLTR h outperforms PLTR on most of the metrics on cognitive task level (i.e., NH @1). PLTR h outperforms PLTR at 1.9%, 2.5%, 1.5% and 2.6% on NH 1 @1, NH 3 @1, NH 5 @1 and NH all @1, respectively. This indicates that generally PLTR h is better than PLTR on ranking cognitive tasks in CV setting. The reason could be that the hinge-based loss functions with pre-defined margins can enable significant difference between the scores of relevant features and irrelevant features, and thus effectively push relevant features upon irrelevant features. Table 2 and Table 3 presents the performance of PLTR, PLTR h and two baseline methods in the LOV setting. We first hold out 26 ( Table 2 ) and 52 (Table 3) AD patients as testing patients, respectively. We determine these holdout AD patients as the ones that have more than 10 similar AD patients in the training set with corresponding patient similarities higher than 0.67 and 0.62, respectively. Table 2 and Table 3 show that PLTR and PLTR h significantly outperform the baseline methods in terms of all the evaluation metrics on cognitive feature level (i.e., QH@5 and WQH@5), which is consistent with the experimental results in CV setting. When 26 patients are hold out for testing, with parameters \u03b1 = 0.5, \u03b2 = 1.5, \u03b3 = 1.0 and d = 30, PLTR outperforms the best baseline method KRL at 13.4% and 1.3% on QH@5 and WQH@5, respectively. The performance of PLTR h is very comparable with that of PLTR \" PLTR h outperforms KRL at 13.4% and 0.5% on QH@5 and WQH@5, respectively. When 52 patients are hold out for testing, with parameters \u03b1 = 0.5, \u03b2 = 0.5, \u03b3 = 1.0 and d = 50, PLTR outperforms the best baseline method KRL at 18.1% and 7.8% on QH@5 and WQH@5, respectively. PLTR h even performs better than PLTR in this setting. In addition, PLTR h outperforms KRL at 19.7% and 9.5% on QH@5 and WQH@5, respectively. These experimental results demonstrate that for new patients, PLTR and PLTR h are able to rank more relevant features to the top of the ranking list than the two baseline methods. They also indicate that for new patients, ranking based methods (e.g., PLTR and PLTR h ) are more effective than regression based methods (e.g., KRL and BMTMKL) for biomarker prioritization. Table 2 also shows that when 26 patients are hold out for testing, PLTR and PLTR h are both able to identify the top most relevant questionnaire for 84.6% of the testing patients (i.e., Table 2 .

Note that the hold-out testing patients in LOV do not have any cognitive features. Therefore, the performance of PLTR and PLTR h as above demonstrates their strong capability in identifying most AD related cognitive features based on imaging features only. We also find that PLTR and PLTR h are able to achieve similar or even better results compared to baseline methods in terms of the evaluation metrics on cognitive task level (i.e., NH @1 and NH @5). When 26 patients are hold out for testing, PLTR and PLTR h outperform the baseline methods in terms of NH @1 (i.e., = 1, 2 . . . 5).

They are only slightly worse than KRL on NH 2 @1, NH 5 @5 (0.423 vs 0.481 on NH 2 @1 and 3.712 vs 3.808 on NH 5 @5). These experimental results demonstrate that among top 5 tasks in the ranking list, PLTR and PLTR h rank more relevant task on top than KRL.\nIt's notable that in Table 2 and Table 3 , as the number of features used to score cognitive tasks (i.e., in NH @k) increases, the performance of all the methods in NH @1 first declines and then increases. This may indicate that as increases, irrelevant features which happen to have relatively high scores will be included in scoring tasks, and thus degrade the model performance on NH @1. However, generally, the scores of irrelevant features are considerably lower than those of relevant ones. Thus, as more features are included, the scores for tasks are more dominated by the scores of relevant features and thus the performance increases.\nWe also find that BMTMKL performs poorly on NH 3 @1 in both Table 2 and Table 3 . This indicates that BMTMKL, a regression-based method, could not well rank relevant features and irrelevant features. It's also notable that generally the best performance for the 26 testing patients is better than that for 52 testing patients. This may be due to that the similarities between the 26 testing patients and their top 10 similar training patients are higher than those for the 52 testing patients. The high similarities enable accurate latent vectors for testing patients. The column \"n\" corresponds to the number of hold-out testing patients. The best performance of each model is in bold.

When 52 patients are hold out for testing, PLTR h is able to achieve better performance than PLTR on QH@5, WQH@5, NH 3 @1, NH 5 @1, NH 5 @5 and NH all @5 and also achieves very comparable performance on the rest metrics.

A number of studies have reported high correlations between various RAVLT scores with different brain regions [3] . For example, RAVLT recall is associated with medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus; RAVLT recognition is highly correlated with thalamic and caudate nuclei. Genetic analysis of APOE \u03b54 allele, the most common variant of AD, reported its association with RAVLT score in an early-MCI (EMCI) study [19] . The fact that RAVLT is prioritized demonstrates the strong power of PLTR in prioritizing cognitive features to assist AD diagnosis.\nSimilarly, we find the top-5 most frequent cognitive tasks corresponding to the performance at NH 3 @5=3.731 for the 26 hold-out testing patients.
