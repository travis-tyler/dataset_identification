[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In late December of 2019, authorities from the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) announced an epidemic of pneumonia 1 . A novel coronavirus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the etiologic agent and the disease has been named \"coronavirus disease 2019\" . The virus spread rapidly, first to Thailand, Japan, Korea, and Europe, and now to over 188 countries across all continents except Antarctica. The global total of infected individuals now exceeds 20 million (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/). Public health professionals around the world are working to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and \"flatten the curve\", which requires a reduction in cases from one day to the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f next. However, SARS-CoV-2 containment has been outpaced by viral spread and limited resources for testing. Moreover, mounting evidence suggests that the virus is not only spread by aerosols but may also be transmitted via feces. Both viral RNA and infectious virus have been detected in the stool of COVID-19 patients [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . This has important implications for the spread of the virus and suggests that wastewater may be used to monitor progression or abatement of viral spread at the community level [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] ."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "To test if wastewater could be used for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance, we collected samples from the municipal wastewater treatment plant in Bozeman, Montana (USA). Untreated wastewater samples were collected on 17 different days over the course of a 74-day period using an autosampler that collects a volume proportional to flow for 24-hours (Supplemental Table S1 ). This composite sample reflects average characteristics of the wastewater over the previous day. The samples were filtered and concentrated prior to RNA extraction. To concentrate SARS-CoV-2 we used ultrafiltration with spin concentrators that efficiently recover viruses from wastewater 11, 18 . Extracted RNA was used as a template for one-step reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), performed according to CDC guidelines (https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download). Each RT-qPCR reaction was performed using two primer pairs (i.e., N1, and N2), which target distinct regions of the nucleocapsid (N) gene from SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 1A and Supplemental Fig S1) .\nComposite samples collected in late March and early April tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, though concentrations of viral RNA steadily declined and then dropped below J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the limit of detection. After a month of undetectable levels of SARS-CoV-2, the wastewater started testing positive again in late May, which coincided with an increase of COVID-19 cases in the community (Fig 1A) .\nCurrent methods for tracking the COVID-19 pandemic primarily rely on clinical test results, but this process involves intrinsic delays that preclude real-time tracking of the outbreak. On average, a person develops symptoms 4-5 days after initial exposure and it's predicted that only 32% of symptomatic individuals are tested 19, 20 . Test results are typically available 3-9 days after illness onset 14, 21 . We hypothesized that wastewater levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA correlate with COVID-19 incidence rates and that this data could be used as an epidemiological indicator to track the outbreak in real-time. To test this hypothesis, we compared our wastewater surveillance data to the frequencies of reported lab-confirmed cases and symptom onset dates that were collected by retrospective interviews. In the initial outbreak (mid-March), SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in the wastewater lags behind symptom onset data by 8-days (Pearson's r = 0.989, Fig 1B) , and preceded laboratory test results for individuals by 2-days (r = 0.969, Fig 1B) . When cases returned in May, wastewater detection trailed symptom onset by 5 days (r = 0.92) and foreshadowed the increase in positive tests by 4 days (r = 0.953, Fig 1C) . While wastewater detection trailed symptom onset by 5 days, it is important to note that the retrospective interviews used to collect symptom onset information are only available approximately 10 days after exposure. Collectively, our analysis demonstrates that wastewater surveillance is the earliest real-time measure of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence (Fig 1D) ."}, {"section_title": "J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f", "text": "To verify that the RT-qPCR results reflect bona fide detection of SARS-CoV-2 rather than priming from an unintended template, we repeated the PCR using 10 primer pairs that tile across the SARS-CoV-2 genome 22 . These primers were designed to target conserved regions of the genome that flank polymorphic sites that have been used to trace viral ancestry and geographic origins 22, 23 (Supplemental Fig S2A) . RNA isolated from the Bozeman waste stream on March 27 th was used as a template for these RT-PCR reactions, and all 10 primer pairs produced PCR products of the expected sizes (Supplemental Table S2 and Supplemental Fig S2B) . PCR products were sequenced using Sanger method and the reads were aligned to the reference genome using MUSCLE 24, 25 . We observed no sequence heterogeneity in redundant reads derived from each location of the genome (Supplemental Fig S2C) . The same RNA sample was further used to determine a near complete (98.5%) SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence using a long-read sequencing platform 22, 26 .\nMutations that do not confer a fitness defect are preserved in viral progeny, and thus serve as genetic landmarks that can be used to trace viral ancestry. Efforts to understand the origins and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 have resulted in ~82,000 genome sequences from 91 countries as of August 13 th , 2020 (https://www.gisaid.org/). Phylogenetic analyses of these sequences have enabled molecular tracking of viral spread [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . To determine the ancestry of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in Bozeman's wastewater on March 27th, we determined the genome sequence using Oxford Nanopore. Approximately 2,000 copies of the viral RNA (estimated with qPCR) were used to generate an amplicon library 26, 33 . Nanopore sequencing on the MinION platform J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f resulted in ~700,000 reads. Quality control and base calling were performed with MinKNOW v19.06.8 in High Accuracy mode (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and the sequences were assembled using the bioinformatic pipeline from ARTIC Network (https://artic.network/ncov-2019). This approach resulted in a single viral contig with an average sequencing depth of 6,875X that covered 98.5% of the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. Unsequenced regions of the genome include the 5'-and 3'-ends, and a stretch of 170 bases (22,346 -22,515 in the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome), that likely had too few reads for basecalling due to PCR bias 34 .\nIn total, we found 11 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the assembled genome that distinguish the Bozeman wastewater SARS-CoV-2 sequence from the Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 reference sequence (Supplemental Fig 2D) . To verify the authenticity of these SNVs, we examined raw sequencing data, which is available on Mendeley (http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/nfsfvy6xkf.1). During this analysis, we noticed that one of the variants (A23122T) was introduced by incomplete trimming of a sequencing adapter (5'-CGTATTGCT) that is partially homologous (underlined) to the reference genome (5'-TACATGCA). This variant has been reported in other genomes sequenced using this protocol 35 and similar issues have been identified in other regions of SARS-CoV-2 genome 36 . In contrast to A23122T, we found no other evidence for trimming artifacts for the 10 remaining SNVs. It is possible that the consensus genome presented here is derived from a chimeric assembly of distinct genotypes, but more than 90% of the reads contain the same variant at each of these 10 positions.\nThe genome was aligned to 14,970 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 74 different countries (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data; https://www.gisaid.org/). The resulting alignment was used to build a phylogenetic tree (Fig 2A) , which indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 genome in Bozeman's wastewater is most closely related to genomes from California (USA) and Victoria (Australia). The three mutations that define the Wuhan WA1 linage (i.e., C8782T, C18060T, T28144C) are not present in the Bozeman WW genome, while all ten mutations in the Bozeman wastewater SARS-CoV-2 sequence co-occur in sequences from California, and nine of these ten mutations are also present in an isolate from Victoria ( To determine how these sequence variations may have accumulated over space and time, we mapped each mutation onto the phylogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 sequences (Fig 2A and Supplemental Fig 2E) . This analysis shows that the A28851T mutation has been acquired most recently and confirms that the assembled genome from the Bozeman wastewater is most closely related to a strain circulating in California. While this sequencing approach reveals the genetic history, it does not measure the fitness of this or any of the mutations associated with distinct geographic locations. We anticipate that temporal genome sequencing from the wastewater will help identify viral strains circulating in a specific community over time."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Collectively, the results presented here demonstrate that wastewater monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-qPCR provides a real-time measure of viral prevalence in the community (Fig 1) . Clinical testing for COVID-19 typically occurs 3-9 days after J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f symptoms onset and might vary depending on availability of tests, care-seeking behavior, workloads in testing facilities and current testing strategy 21, 39, 40 . In our study, wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 foreshadowed new case reports by 2-4 days.\nThe statistics of lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases not only lag behind viral spread, but also underestimates the true scale of the current pandemic. Recent analysis of outpatient surveillance data estimates that only 32% of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals in the US sought medical care 40 . These challenges are overcome with wastewater testing, which captures input from all individuals in the local community and thus has the potential for estimating the true prevalence of COVID-19 using computational models that account for the median viral load in stool, virus degradation rates, travel time to the treatment facility and water use per-capita 14, 41 . Furthermore, wastewater may capture mild and asymptomatic infections that might be used to alert\nPublic Health officials about emerging undetected transmission events 6 .\nMonitoring wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 provides a useful epidemiological metric that could help track the outbreak and inform policy. The study presented here complements the rapidly emerging body of work by providing an important link between wastewater surveillance, COVID-19 epidemiology and tracing SARS-CoV-2 spread patterns with genome sequencing."}, {"section_title": "Limitations of Study", "text": "J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Nanopore sequencing has an error rate of about 10-15%, which precludes reliable detection of rare genotypes 33, 42 . Therefore, the protocol used here is limited to the detection of genotypes with greater than 10-15% representation. Due to this limitation of the sequencing approach we cannot exclude a possibility of chimeric genome assembly. Additional sequencing efforts are required to correlate results from wastewater to clinical isolates and determine how ratios of SARS-CoV-2 variants in wastewater translate to ratios in the population.\nAn additional limitation of this study is the use of a single method for the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater. While others have shown that centrifugal ultrafiltration is effective, comparative analyses of alternative concentration protocols, RNA extraction methods and diagnostic primer sets are required to correlate results from different groups and build standard approach for wastewater-based SARS-CoV-2 surveillance [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Table S3 ). The phylogenetic analysis in this paper would not have been possible without their willingness to share data. We thank the reviewers for helping identify a mutation that was introduced by incomplete trimming of an adaptor.

The 95% confidence intervals for the highest Pearson's r values and respective off-sets are shown. Data for initial surge (March-April) and resurgence (May) were analyzed separately. Surge boundaries were defined as earliest reported symptom onset (left boundary) and date with last reported positive test (right boundary). The interval between surges with zero reported cases/symptoms (mid-April -mid-May) was dropped from the analysis. D) Timeline of the indicators used in the study. Symptom onset is the earliest available estimate of the viral spread. However, this data is collected retrospectively, which preclude its use for real-time tracking of the outbreak. Wastewater correlates with symptom onset and could be used to track progressing outbreak.
