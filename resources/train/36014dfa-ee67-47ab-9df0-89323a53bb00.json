[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Coronavirus Disease 2019 has emerged as a global epidemic affecting millions of individuals globally and imposes a huge burden on the socio-economic welfare and healthcare systems of nations. At present the need for assays for rapid detection for diagnosis and surveillance, understanding the genetic epidemiology and evolution of the virus would be central for managing the spread of the epidemic (J. Meredith et al., 2020) . The advantage of quick sequencing of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome led to the development of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based diagnostic assays that leveraged rapid identification of infected individuals to get fast medical support or quantization essential to both patient management and incidence tracking (Wu et al., 2020) . Identification of early imported cases in France helped to prevent immediate secondary transmission (Bernard Stoecklin et al., 2020) . Singapore's enhanced surveillance and containment strategy also led to the suppressed expansion of SARS-CoV-2 (de Lusignan et al.,"}, {"section_title": "2020). On similar grounds, The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP)", "text": "Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) have rapidly expanded their national surveillance system to combat SARS-CoV-2 (Ng et al., 2020) . Coupled with a highly accurate and high-throughput method of detection, this approach will become more effective in dealing with COVID-19.\nA number of approaches have been widely used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical samples. Some of these approaches have also been adapted to enable higher throughputs. These methods are majorly subdivided into antigen-antibody based serological assays, nucleic acid based amplification assays and sequencing based assays. While serological assays are rapid detection tests, they have low sensitivity and specificity (D\u00f6hla et al., 2020) . Nucleic acid based amplification such as Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR) has been the gold standard in detection and diagnosis, but a negative RT-PCR does not eliminate the possibility of infection in clinically suspected cases (Wang et al., 2020) . Such results should be carefully interpreted to avoid false negative reporting (Kucirka et al., 2020) . Moreover, these tests have been developed for diagnostic purposes and do not provide much information on the nature of the virus, its 4 of 25 genetic information and evolutionary pattern. In this regard, recently developed Next generation sequencing based methods are potentially a good alternative for detection of SARS-CoV-2 ('First NGS-based COVID-19 diagnostic', 2020).\nThe rapid advancement of Next generation sequencing technology and analysis methods has enabled understanding the genetic makeup of SARS-CoV-2 and interpreting its evolutionary epidemiology. Viral RNA sequencing from the initial cluster of cases deciphered the full genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (Zhu et al., 2020) . This led to other sequencing based studies for detailed genomic characterization of the virus (R. . Combined genetic and epidemiological studies have been suggested to provide insights into spread of the infection, evolutionary patterns and genetic diversity of the virus (J. Meredith et al., 2020) , for further assisting in effective management and preventive measures. Genomic surveillance coupled with agent-based modelling in Australia has been observed as an excellent approach to investigate and regulate COVID-19 transmission (Rockett et al., 2020) .\nTowards these efforts, several openly available databases have also been developed such as the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) that facilitates rapid and open sharing of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences (Shu and McCauley, 2017) .\nThus, along with detection, sequencing based methods may also provide an added advantage of understanding the genetic epidemiology of the outbreak.\nIn the present study, we describe the application of the COVIDSeq protocol recently approved by the US FDA for clinical use. This protocol envisages high-throughput detection and genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 isolates using a multiplex PCR amplicon based enrichment followed by barcoding with a throughput of 1536 samples in a single sequencing run using NovaSeq S4 flow cell. Our analysis suggests that COVIDSeq protocol could be a sensitive approach for detection with additional insights offered through genetic epidemiology with respect to the genetic lineages. To the best of our knowledge this is the first real-life evaluation of COVIDSeq protocol."}, {"section_title": "Patients and Samples", "text": "The study was approved by the Institutional Human Ethics Committee (IHEC No. Dated CSIR-IGIB/IHEC/2020-21/01).\nSamples from nasal, nasopharyngeal, and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained according to the standard protocol and collected in 3 ml sterile viral transport medium (VTM) tube or 1ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen).

An average base quality of Q30 and read length cut-off of 30 bps were used for trimming, apart from the adapter sequences. We followed a recently published protocol to perform reference-based assembly (Poojary et al., 2019) . As per protocol, the trimmed reads were aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh38 / hg38) and SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome (NC_045512.2) using HISAT2-2.1 (Kim, Langmead and Salzberg, 2015) . The reads mapped to hg38 were further discarded and the unaligned reads were extracted using samtools (v 1.10) (Li et al., 2009) . The unaligned reads were further mapped to the Wuhan Hu-1 genome and the alignment statistics were evaluated (Wu et al., 2020) . (Shen et al., 2016) were used to generate the consensus sequence.

We followed a previously described protocol for phylogenetic clustering (Jolly and Scaria, 2020 under review). A total of 26 COVIDSeq genomes having Ns > 5% were removed from the analysis. Genomes from GISAID having Ns > 5% and ambiguous dates of sample collection were also excluded from the analysis.

We compared the sample type (e.g. positive, pan-sarbeco, inconclusive and negative) WGS output and calculated percent of genome covered, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision and gain of detection rate.

These include shotgun approaches (Harilal et al., 2020) , capture based (Wen et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2020) as well as amplicon based (Baker et al., 2020) approaches followed by Next Generation\nSequencing. Typically the multiplex barcoded library sequencing has been implemented for sample numbers less than 96. A number of approaches have been suggested to increase the throughput of sequencing using barcoded libraries (Palmieri et al., 2020; Schmid-Burgk et al., 2020) . There is a paucity of data on higher order multiplex barcoding and sequencing approaches in clinical samples.\nIn the present report, we evaluated the COVIDSeq approach for high-throughput detection of SARS-CoV-2 which uses multiplex PCR followed by barcoded libraries and sequencing on a next-generation sequencing platform which envisages sequencing 1536 samples per flow cell. We analysed 752 clinical samples in technical duplicates.\nOur analysis suggests a high concordance between technical duplicates and a high concordance of detection of SARS-CoV-2 between the COVIDSeq as well as RT-PCR approaches. Our comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 detection with RT-PCR and COVIDSeq test showed that COVIDSeq test outperformed with increased sensitivity, precision and accuracy. COVIDSeq protocol detected SARS-CoV-2 in samples previously categorised as inconclusive (21/35), pan-sarbeco (16/43) and negative (6/19) using RT-PCR assays suggesting a higher sensitivity of the sequencing based assay compared to RT-PCR. This corresponded to an additional 43/97 samples and a potential gain of 5.71% of samples of the whole dataset and 44.33% of the samples which were considered inconclusive (N=97), suggesting that the sequencing approach could be used as a potential orthogonal approach to confirm cases which are doubtful or inconclusive in RT-PCR. Notwithstanding the advantage, 16 samples which were annotated positive in RT-PCR were missed in the COVIDSeq approach. Our analysis also suggests the protocol is compatible with different approaches for RNA isolation 19 of 25 suggesting a wider applicability in clinical settings where pooling from different labs becomes inevitable.\nThe COVIDSeq approach additionally provided insights into the genetic epidemiology and evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Phylogenetic analysis could be performed for a significantly large number of genomes which gave insights into the prevalent lineage/clades of the virus (Langat et al., 2017; Michie et al., 2020; Shakya et al., 2020) .\nThis analysis also reports two lineages B.1.112 and B.1.99 for the first time in India.\nFurthermore, a total of 1,143 unique variants were contributed by this analysis to the global repertoire of genetic variants. As expected, a significant number of variants were non-synonymous in nature (Kryazhimskiy, Bazykin and Dushoff, 2008; Tang et al., 2020) . The present analysis adds a total of 73 novel variants identified for the first time in genomes. Apart from the throughput of sample analysis, the COVIDSeq approach is also remarkable in terms of speed, with a sequencing time of 11 hours and analysis timeline of 6 hours. Given that the NovaSeq 6000 sequencer used in the present study can handle two S4 flow cells in parallel, this could be potentially scaled to a throughput of 1536x2 samples that can be handled in parallel.\nIn conclusion, our analysis suggests that COVIDSeq is a high-throughput sequencing based approach which is sensitive for detection of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, COVIDSeq has an additional advantage of enabling genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2."}]
