[{"section_title": "", "text": "suggest that curricular music education is widely available in most elementary (94%) and secondary (91%) schools across the country (Parsad & Spiegelman, 2012). And yet, the availability of and access to school music programs differ from community to community across the United States. Schools with larger concentrations of poverty have been found to be less likely to offer music instruction (81% in the lowest socioeconomic status [SES] vs. 96% in the highest SES schools), and these same schools offered fewer music courses than their higher SES counterparts (Parsad & Spiegelman, 2012). Researchers in music education have reported similar differences based on school characteristics. In a national survey of school principals, Abril and Gault (2008) found that while the vast majority of secondary schools offered courses in music, low SES schools offered significantly fewer music course types than their high SES counterparts. Availability and access to elective music courses may vary by course type, but researchers have yet to uncover the nature of these differences. Music in U.S. secondary schools is most commonly an elective course, so the existence of a program does not necessarily translate into access, participation, or equity. A study of a large school district in Texas found that while music programs may be present in schools of different SES levels, their quality varied. Schools with a lower SES and higher minority population were found to have fewer resources allocated for music (Costa-Giomi & Chappell, 2007). Research with the school as the unit of analysis suggests that there are differences in terms of the presence, prevalence, and funding of school music programs, mediated by a school's status as public, private, or charter; the school community's average level of SES; and the demographics of the school's student body (Elpus, 2017b). Understanding the systemic barriers that prevent students from participating in school music may necessitate an analysis of participation at the student level. About 36% of students in the 2004 U.S. senior class earned at least one credit of music upon graduation with the majority of these students participating in traditional U.S. school music ensembles (Elpus, 2013). Previously published estimates based on nationally representative samples indicate that the participation rate for school music ensembles is around 21% (Elpus & Abril, 2011;Lorah, Sanders, & Morrison, 2014). While there are large numbers of students participating in music ensembles, on average, these students hail from families that are more privileged than those of non-music ensemble students (Elpus & Abril, 2011). Socioeconomic status, a variable closely linked to race and ethnicity in the United States, has been found to be the strongest of several predictors of student retention in instrumental music study (Klinedinst, 1991). There is a body of research that provides a strong case for the predictive value of SES in a student's access to and retention in a school music program. The socioeconomic gap in music ensemble participation often is attributed to the expenses associated with instrumental music study, but the conjecture that, for instance, instrumental or vocal ensembles are more or less accessible to some socioeconomic groups than others has yet to be tested empirically on a national level. There also seems to be a strong relationship between academic achievement and participation in music ensembles. Mikzsa (2010) found that high school sophomores (in 2002) who participated in school ensembles had higher math achievement than students who did not, regardless of SES. Previously, we have found significant associations between music ensemble participation and academic achievement, suggesting that higher academically achieving students may be drawn to the study of music (Elpus & Abril, 2011). The associations between music participation and academic achievement are likely related to overall SES levels. A number of studies have found that students who study music in school outperform their non-music participation counterparts, which of course does not account for the type of music program or the quality of said program. Prior studies have examined the relationship between gender and participation in high school music education. In our earlier work (Elpus & Abril, 2011), we found that the overall representation of females was higher (61.1%) than that of males in ensemble courses, a figure strikingly similar to one reported 30 years earlier, when ensemble students were 61.4% female (Stewart, 1991). This was confirmed in a subsequent study that reported that females were overrepresented in bands and orchestras but to a much smaller degree than choral ensembles, where males were significantly underrepresented by more than a 2:1 ratio (Elpus, 2015). In contrast, female instrumental students were found to be less likely to participate in and more likely to withdraw from high school jazz ensembles than their male counterparts (McKeage, 2004). Music study may be of particular value to English language learners (ELL) given the positive relationships found between music study, pitch perception, and productive phonology (Posedel, Emery, Souza, & Fountain, 2011) as well as the reported similarities between music perception and language development (Patel, 2010). Studies have reported that native Spanish speakers, many of whom may be ELL at some point in their schooling, were significantly underrepresented in high school music ensembles (Elpus & Abril, 2011). In fact, native English-speaking students were twice as likely to have participated in ensemble courses than native Spanish-speaking students. Lorah et al. (2014) reported that participation rates in school ensembles of 10th graders are better predicted by SES and academic achievement than by ELL status. It may be that students who are non-native English speakers and/or classified as ELL are tracked into remedial courses in language, which systematically exclude them from participation in music or other electives. Given the relationship between Latino students (many of whom are native Spanish speakers) and SES in the United States, it may be the financial demands of school music study that act as a barrier to participation. The underrepresentation of ELL and Latino students is a matter that warrants further investigation, especially given the dramatic rise in this particular population across the country. Some contend that the problem of participation can be attributed to the types of courses most commonly offered as music electives (band and choir) and the curricular limits and pedagogical approaches used to teach them (Williams, 2011). In prior work, we have suggested that financial (SES), ethnic/racial, and academic variables may explain underrepresentation in ensembles (Elpus & Abril, 2011). Research has yet to examine the profile of students by music ensemble type. Understanding who is represented and underrepresented in the most commonly offered music courses in U.S. secondary schools might help pinpoint problems of access and equity. Making music education accessible to all children, regardless of race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, and linguistic background, has been an ongoing challenge for policymakers, administrators, and educators (Declaration on Equity in Music for City Students, 2018). The purpose of the present study was to construct a complete demographic profile of high school music ensemble students using nationally representative data for the U.S. graduating high school class of 2013. We analyzed sample members' complete high school transcripts to create a nuanced demographic profile of students enrolled in specific types of ensembles offered in U.S. high schools, compared these findings to those of our earlier work (Elpus & Abril, 2011), and determined how various demographic variables predict enrollment in specific types of ensembles. We addressed the following research questions: (1) What proportion of U.S. high school students enrolled in their school's band, choir, and/or orchestra? What proportion of U.S. high school students enrolled in non-ensemble music courses? (2) What are the demographic characteristics of high school music ensemble students? (3) What is the relationship between student demographic characteristics and the likelihood of music ensemble enrollment?"}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": "The present article is a conceptual replication and an extension of our earlier study examining the demographic profile of students involved in high school music ensembles (Elpus & Abril, 2011). The replication element of our study examines similar research questions as the prior work using a nationally representative sample of U.S. high school students from a more recent cohort. Although two data points do not establish a trend, replicating the earlier work with more recent data allows us to begin to track changes, if any, in the composition of U.S. high school music ensemble students over time. The replication can provide preliminary evidence to determine if certain findings from the previous work hold for newer national data or may have instead been due to a specific cohort effect observable only in the prior data. Beyond updating our prior study for a more recent cohort, we also extend the prior work in two key ways: First, we identify music ensemble students using sample members' high school transcripts. Second, while we replicate the earlier bivariate comparisons of music and nonmusic student characteristics, we also extend this analysis to a multivariate context that seeks to estimate the unique nature of each identified preexisting difference while controlling for the other characteristics."}, {"section_title": "Data Source", "text": "The present study makes use of the restricted-use data set of the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS), a nationally representative longitudinal study of U.S. education that follows the cohort of students who were ninth graders in the 2008-2009 school year. Sample members (N = 25,210) attended one of 940 participating high schools from throughout the nation. The sample was drawn in two stages such that the 940 high schools were randomly sampled from among the universe of all high schools in the United States that enrolled ninth graders and students from within those schools were probabilistically sampled to participate in the study. The complex multistage nature of the sampling allowed the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) to derive sampling weights that, when applied to analyses of these data, ensure that estimates obtained are representative of the population of ninth-grade students in 2008-2009. The modal high school graduation year for this cohort of U.S. freshmen was 2013, and we consistently use the phrase class of 2013 to refer to the cohort. One key difference in the present study compared to our prior study is that we use high school transcript data rather than self-reported responses to a survey question to identify music ensemble students. In the 2011 study, we identified music ensemble students using self-reported responses to a survey question included in the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS) that asked sample members to indicate whether they had \"participated in their school's band, choir, or orchestra.\" The newer HSLS did not include questions directly asking participants about their music ensemble participation, precluding our use of self-reported data to identify music students. Although this change was a necessity due to the structure of the new HSLS survey, we remain confident in the comparability of our present results and our earlier (2011) results because recent methodological research has shown that self-reported answers to survey questions about music ensemble participation correspond closely-albeit not perfectly-to music ensemble enrollment as indicated by transcript data (Elpus, 2017a). One added benefit of the change in method, however, is that using transcript data affords us the opportunity to disaggregate descriptive results for band, choir, and orchestra students, which adds a welcome level of precision missing from the earlier study. Using transcript data also provides us an additional innovation from the prior work: We can now accurately identify music students who enrolled in a high school music ensemble at any point in their high school career and not simply those who participated as 12th graders."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Approach", "text": "We examined the bivariate relationships between demographic characteristics and music enrollment status using the Rao-Scott adjusted \u03c7 2 (Rao & Scott, 1984), a nonparametric test of association for categorical variables that is adjusted for complex survey sampling and weighting. Although our sample size is quite large, we make many bivariate comparisons on the HSLS data. To control for the possibility of an inflated familywise error rate arising from the multiple bivariate comparisons we report in this article, we set a conservative alpha for statistical significance of our bivariate analyses at .001. Additionally, we extend the research by also conducting multivariate analyses using logistic regression. We use logistic regression to estimate the likelihood that a student would enroll in at least one year of any music ensemble based on the vector of characteristics found to differ between music and nonmusic students in the bivariate analyses. To ensure that our estimates are nationally representative, we employ both the appropriate HSLS survey weights in the logistic regression and survey-adjusted standard errors computed from balanced, repeated replications that account for the complex survey sampling design of HSLS. Logistic regression allows us to consider the unique impact of each demographic characteristic on the likelihood that a student would enroll in a music ensemble while controlling for the other characteristics included in the model. We estimate the following theoretical model:  As logistic regression coefficients are logarithmic odds ratios and thus not easily interpretable in a direct way, we report our results using odds ratios that explicate the relative likelihood of enrolling in a music ensemble for the given characteristic. Odds ratios themselves, however, are multiplicative; therefore, large changes in odds ratios sometimes obfuscate what are in reality small overall changes in probability. As such, we also report estimated average marginal effects (i.e., the predicted probabilities averaged across all observations) associated with each characteristic in the logistic regression models."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Descriptive Results", "text": "Overall Enrollment Rates and Student Characteristics. Overall, 24% of the graduating class of 2013 enrolled in one or more music ensembles (for credit course in band, choir, or orchestra) during any of the four years of high school. Music ensemble courses were more heavily populated than were non-ensemble music courses: Only 3% of students enrolled in at least one high school guitar class, 3% enrolled in at least one piano class, and less than 1% of students (about eight-tenths of 1%) enrolled in at least one music technology course. Choir was the most popular music ensemble in terms of enrollment percentage, with 13% of students enrolling in a choir class at some point during high school. 1 Band enrollment rates closely followed the choir rate, with 11% of students enrolling in at least one band course at some point during high school. Orchestra trailed far behind the other two ensembles, with only 2% of students nationally enrolling in at least one orchestra class during high school. highest achieving parents' level of education, family composition, standardized math test scores, and grade earned for eighth-grade math. Also included in Table 1 are the results of two survey questions about out-of-school activities during the year encompassing the end of eighth and the beginning of ninth grade asked of sample members' parents: (a) whether sample members had participated in an out-of-school visual or performing arts activity and (b) whether sample members had attended a play, concert, or other live arts event with their parent. For membership in any ensemble, the characteristics of race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, parental education, native language, standardized math test scores, eighth-grade math grades, out-of-school visual/performing arts activity, and having attended a play, concert, or other live arts event with a parent were all significantly associated with ensemble enrollment at p < .001, whereas family composition was not significantly different for ensemble members than for nonmusic students. This pattern of results did not hold in the disaggregated analyses, which show that most of the overall differences between music ensemble and nonmusic students are driven primarily by differences in the instrumental ensembles. Choir students were not significantly different than nonchoir students for any characteristic except for birth-assigned sex, where the female-to-male ratio was 70:30. Band students were significantly different than nonband students in every characteristic except birth-assigned assigned sex-including for family composition, which was not significant for ensemble membership in aggregate. Orchestra students were significantly different from nonorchestra students on every characteristic except birth-assigned sex, where there was a 61:39 female to male ratio. Specific results for each bivariate comparison are available in the Appendix in the online version of the article. Note. Totals within characteristics may not equal 100% due to rounding.  Table 2 presents the results of the logistic regression estimates for Equation 1 for all ensembles aggregated as well as disaggregated results for choir, band, and orchestra. A clear advantage of the logistic regression analysis over the bivariate analyses is that the logistic regression model estimates the unique, individual impact of each demographic characteristic while controlling for the other characteristics. Considered holistically, the logistic regression results show a similar pattern of results to the bivariate analyses reported previously. Considering the aggregated ensemble (Model 1) and disaggregated ensembles (Models 2-4) together suggests that certain individual ensembles drive the imbalances seen in overall ensemble enrollment. Specifically, it is clear from the logistic regression results that the overall imbalance in birth-assigned sex between music and nonmusic students is primarily driven by the overrepresentation of females in choir. However, it is also clear from the logistic regression models that the other imbalances between music and nonmusic students are driven primarily by students who enroll in instrumental ensembles: With the exception of birth-assigned sex, no demographic characteristic was significantly associated with a greater likelihood of enrollment in choir. Importantly, there was a significant interaction between prior academic achievement (as measured by a standardized algebra test), race/ethnicity, and music ensemble enrollment. The presence of the significant interaction means that the \"main effects\" of test scores and race/ethnicity are not directly interpretable; those interested in understanding the distribution of race/ethnicity among ensemble students should consult the bivariate results in Table 1. Figure 1 displays the interaction effect in Model 1. For all race/ethnicity categories except for students identifying as Black or African American, the likelihood that a student would enroll in a music ensemble increases as prior academic achievement increases. However, for Black or African American students, the trend is reversed: The likelihood of ensemble enrollment decreases as academic achievement increases. This is a novel result and bears further investigation."}, {"section_title": "Bivariate Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Multivariate Analysis", "text": "Because logistic regression coefficients are not directly interpretable and odds ratios are multiplicative in nature, we have calculated average marginal effects (AME) to further interpret the logistic regression results. The AME reported are the predicted probabilities of enrolling in music estimated by the model averaged across observations. To better understand AME, it is worthwhile to note that the baseline probability of a student enrolling in a music ensemble at some point during high school was .25 and the baseline probability of not enrolling in an ensemble was .75. The probability for male students of enrolling in a music ensemble was .20, and the probability for female students was .31. The predicted probabilities for enrolling in an ensemble by race and ethnicity, averaged across observations, were .26 for White, .23 for Black or African American, .22 for Hispanic or Latino, .23 for Asian/Pacific Islander, .22 for American Indian or Alaska Native, and .25 for multiracial. An increase of one standard deviation in the SES index resulted in a .03 increase in the probability of enrolling in a music ensemble. Across the range of SES values observed, there was a monotonic increase in the likelihood of enrolling in a music ensemble. Students with the lowest observed SES index had a .20 probability of enrolling in a music ensemble, whereas students with the highest observed SES index had a .34 chance of enrolling in a music ensemble. Prior academic achievement was similarly related to the likelihood of enrolling in an ensemble. A one standard deviation increase in prior academic achievement as measured by the standardized algebra test score was associated with a .04 increase in the probability of being in a music ensemble. Across the range of test scores, there was a consistent increase in the probability of enrolling in a music ensemble. Students at the lowest observed math test scores had a .16 probability of enrolling in a music ensemble, whereas students at the highest observed test scores had a .39 probability of eventually enrolling in a music ensemble.

Although this figure may seem to reflect a slight increase from the 21% participation rate previously reported for the class of 2004 (Elpus & Abril, 2011), it is important to note that that the current Figure 1.

Note that for all students except those identifying as Black or African American, the probability of enrolling in any music ensemble increases as standardized test scores increase. This trend is reversed among Black or African American students. study reflects ensemble enrollment in any of the four years of high school, whereas the prior study reflected self-reported participation only in the senior year of high school. What is clear from the current study is that choir (13%) and band (11%) continue to be the most popular music courses in high school. This makes sense given the fact that they are also the most prevalent form of music courses offered in secondary schools across the United States (Abril & Gault, 2008;Parsad & Spiegelman, 2012). Orchestra, while often grouped together with the other ensembles, lags far behind the other ensembles in terms of uptake-orchestra students make up only a small portion (2%) of students, less than guitar (3%) and keyboard (3%) courses. Music education scholars, music educators, and policymakers have suggested including new, less traditional music course offerings to increase student participation in school music. Would participation rates increase significantly if there were an increase in the types of music courses offered beyond choir and band? Less common courses such as music technology, songwriting, or popular music ensemble might draw a different segment of the population to the study of music, as has been suggested by Williams (2011). However, if the goal is to increase participation, it is doubtful that courses that demand smaller class sizes than large ensembles could ever result in a noticeable increase in overall participation in music. The constraint of requiring a smaller class size, by extension, limits the degree to which the introduction of these classes might meaningfully increase the proportion of students electing to study music in high school. We may already observe evidence of the limits of expanding the music curriculum using courses that, by necessity, have low enrollment caps: Music technology courses are limited by the number of computer stations available in the classroom and served only 0.80% of the class of 2013. With that said, the problem may not be in increasing the number of students in music courses (which is commonly heard in professional rhetoric) so much as ensuring that music courses are attracting a representative and wide cross-section of the general student population. Reaffirming the results of prior research, we find that females were overrepresented in music ensembles overall, with the birth-assigned sex imbalance most pronounced in choir and orchestra. The overrepresentation of female students in choir is not particularly surprising, and the 70%/30% split we find here is strikingly consistent to a prior study examining choral music enrollment across 10 nationally representative cohorts spanning three decades (Elpus, 2015). Given that we found no significant imbalance between males and females in band for this cohort, the imbalance among choir and orchestra students drives the association between sex and overall music ensemble enrollment for the class of 2013. As in prior research, we found race/ethnicity to be significantly associated with overall music ensemble enrollments; however, our disaggregated ensemble analysis revealed new evidence about the precise the nature of this often reported association. Enrollment in choral music was not associated with student race/ethnicity, reflecting the reality for the class of 2013 that choral music students were not significantly different from the population of all students in terms of their racial and ethnic composition. Choral music students were also statistically similar to the population of all students in terms of their native language. This new evidence suggests that students may not be systematically excluded from elective music courses because of their status as English language learners, a speculation made in prior research (Elpus & Abril, 2011). One might intuit that those whose native language is not English might be less likely to sing in a choir because of the language reading expectations inherent in choirs, but this does not seem to be the case here. Why might choirs be most reflective of the general population on an ethic/racial and linguistic level? Musically, it may be that choirs are the most malleable of traditional school ensembles. Choir students can perform music of a wide array of cultures and styles and even learn to use their voices in ways that are most appropriate for a given song type. This versatility of being able to develop and use the voice to make music in varied ways might be attractive to students from varying cultural backgrounds. Choral music, too, may be more readily available as an avenue of ensemble music-making for those high school students who, for any of a variety of reasons, did not begin to develop proficiency on a band or orchestra instrument in their earlier schooling. Furthermore, choirs may require less time commitment and financial demands than band, which possibly makes them more attractive to students who have familial or work commitments and those of more limited financial means. Although the reasons have yet to be explicated sufficiently in the research literature, it seems clear from this analysis that with the exception of being overwhelmingly female, the population of choir students looks like the population of all students. In contrast, we found significant bivariate relationships between instrumental music ensemble enrollments and race/ethnicity. For the class of 2013, African American and Latino students were significantly underrepresented in high school band and orchestra programs. Further complicating the issue is the conflation of race, ethnicity, and social class in modern America and the consequents of that conflation on the outcomes of schooling; the conflation manifests in our analysis as the significant interaction effect between race/ethnicity and prior academic achievement. Prior research on school band programs has reported that schools with higher concentrations of non-White students contended with fewer financial resources, less well-appointed facilities, and lower parental support for music than schools with lower concentrations of non-White students (Costa-Giomi & Chappell, 2007). This raises an obvious question: Is the underrepresentation of African American and Latino students in instrumental music a problem of access, a problem of appeal, or a matter of familial support? A problem of access would be evidenced by a lack of instrumental music programs in schools serving greater proportions of African American and Latino students. A problem of appeal would be evidenced by the existence of programs in schools serving African American and Latino populations that suffer from low uptake because instrumental music is not an attractive option for African American and Latino students to choose as one of relatively few elective course options. Evidence to suggest a challenge of familial support would require research on a population that is somewhat elusive to music education researchers: a diverse sample of students and their families who opt not to pursue an accessible instrumental music education program. Future research, perhaps using qualitative methods, could help illuminate the issue of familial support for the study of ensemble music among underrepresented students. The varying student demographic profiles of each ensemble type suggest other concerns for the music education profession to consider. Perhaps unsurprisingly to music educators and music education researchers, we found that White and Asian/Pacific Islander students were overrepresented in orchestra programs. Clearly, the various school music ensembles are the present-day products of particular historical and cultural connotations that cannot easily be erased or changed, especially by music educators and policymakers alone. Although choirs may be more culturally malleable, given the presence of singing in most of the world's cultures, they are also overwhelmingly gendered in schools. This is perhaps a curious and puzzling artifact of the feminization of singing in a culture that still manages to celebrate and idolize singers of all genders. Instrumental ensembles, conversely, tend to be more culturally rigid and descend from a decidedly White and Western European lineage of musical tradition, with connotations and differing values that extend beyond the West. Future research may consider examining pedagogical differences in each of these ensembles and how they might perpetuate the racial and ethnic homogenization of instrumental music and the gendered nature of choral singing. Ultimately, the profession of music education must consider how the music-making experiences that we offer can afford students of all genders and cultural backgrounds a space to inscribe their own narratives. Taken together, the disaggregated results regarding prior academic achievement suggest that students who eventually enroll in the instrumental ensembles of band and orchestra are, on average, performing better academically prior to high school than are their peers who never enroll in band. Students who eventually enroll in at least one year of choir, however, do not seem to be similarly advantaged. That instrumental groups attract students who are, on average, more academically able than their peers is a result that raises further questions for future research. This is an instance, too, where persistence in music enrollment may make a difference. It is possible, for example, that students who persist for multiple years in choral music are more similar academically to their instrumental peers than students who only enroll in one year of choir to perhaps fill a needed arts requirement. Demographic research in music education serves to illuminate exactly whom we mean when we talk of \"school music students.\" Recruitment is a commonly discussed topic in music teacher preparation curricular and texts and a commonly reported concern of music teachers working in the secondary levels. Researchers and music educators are both well served by research that examines the population of music students, both so that any comparisons of \"music\" and \"nonmusic\" students can be made fair by understanding the preexisting population differences that might influence such comparisons and so that we can be introspective and critically examine the nature of our reach and the degree to which we succeed in making students more musically educated."}, {"section_title": "Declaration of Conflicting Interests", "text": "The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}]
