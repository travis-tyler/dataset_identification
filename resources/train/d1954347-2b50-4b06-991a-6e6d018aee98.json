[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Overview", "text": "Accurate forecasting of tropical cyclones is of great importance, especially for communities where landfall might occur due to the extreme damage caused. The most likely future path of a tropical cyclone can be modeled [e.g., McAdie and Lawrence, 2000] with low track error (300 km for the North Atlantic in 2000-2005 for a 48 h forecast [DeMaria et al., 2007] , \u223c150 km for 48 h forecasts in 2014 [National Hurricane Center, 2014] ). Improvements to these forecasts has meant that the National Hurricane Center track and intensity forecasts increased from 3 days to 5 days in 2003, and warnings being issued on a 36 h time frame in 2010. Tropical cyclones deviating from the forecast are monitored and tested to improve the limitations of such forecasting [e.g., Brennan and Majumdar, 2011] . However, while the global forecasting models are successful at predicting the track of the cyclone, they are not as good at predicting the wind intensities [Rappaport et al., 2009; DeMaria et al., 2007] .\nGlobally, one of the most severe tropical cyclones on record to date occurred in 2013 in the Philippines. Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) had wind speeds in excess of 300 km h \u22121 [Schiermeier, 2013] and caused over 6300 deaths (with a further 29,000 people injured or missing) with damages totaling U.S. $2 billion [National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, 2014] . Romps et al. [2014] have recently linked lightning flash rates to increasing temperature in global climate models, suggesting a 12% increase in flash rates per degree Celsius of warming over the U.S. This increasing lightning activity is an unknown factor, in terms of addition to a noise background or strike rate enhancement, and has the potential to be beneficial if the flash rate can be used as a predicting tool in tropical cyclones.\nThe first attempts to track tropical cyclones using atmospheric electrical activity were made in 1938; it was concluded from a study of six Atlantic storms that \"static\" (electrical activity) did not appear in the center of the storm but rather on its edges [Sashoff and Roberts, 1942] . Lightning has also been detected during aircraft penetration of storm interiors, although this came under debate as being caused by the aircraft themselves [Black and Hallett, 1986] . The first study to investigate the links between lightning and wind speed intensity [Lyons and Keen, 1994] determined that \"supercell\" convective clouds may lead to an increase in storm intensity and in turn, cloud to ground lightning discharges. This study found that lightning occurring in the eyewalls of two case study storms preceded periods of storm intensification where usually there would be very little lightning activity. Lightning in the eyewall was later characterized as rare, requiring updrafts stronger than 10 m s \u22121 , and linked to mixed-phase regions containing ice and supercooled water [Black and Hallett, 1999] . Willis et al. [1994] showed that a rapid electric field gradient is formed when the tropical cyclone exhibits strong vertical velocities with charge separation forming from the interaction of graupel and small ice particles. Recently, researchers have been investigating the lightning within tropical cyclones in an attempt to improve our understanding of storm structure and the changes in wind intensity [e.g., Thomas et al., 2010; Reinhart et al., 2014] . Fierro and Reisner [2011] also linked lightning activity to the latent heat release within tropical cyclones. Price et al. [2009] performed an analysis of 58 categories 4 and 5 tropical cyclones and concluded that lightning flash rates have a typical 30 h lead on the maximum winds in a tropical cyclone. In a similar style, Pan et al.\n[2014] performed a study of super and weak typhoons which resulted in lightning lead times of 30 and 60 h, respectively. Abarca and Corbosiero [2011] showed that lightning flash density is higher when tropical cyclone wind speeds are increasing, leading to a study of rapid intensification changes by DeMaria et al. [2012] , who concluded that lightning can be used to improve short term (24 h) predictions of wind intensification.\nOur paper reexamines the study of Price et al. [2009] , and we aim to test the validity of their conclusions and extend their method to a much larger storm data set. As well as expanding the number of storms we also perform a fixed time lag analysis for a range of times. We also include a table of probabilities that the peak winds occur within a set number of hours from the peak in lightning strike rate. In this study we will henceforth refer to all high-category tropical storms as tropical cyclones, regardless of their basin of origin and thus include hurricanes and typhoons. time period. It should be noted by looking at Figures 1 (left) and 1 (right) that it also removed a small number of strikes in the (\u2212600, \u2212200) region. A higher flash rate detection efficiency could lead to higher flash magnitudes which should produce better defined changes in activity. While the frequency of flash rates increase we do not expect this to change the shape of the flash distribution over time and investigation of Hurricane Dennis (see section 2.2) shows only small changes in the shape of the lightning flash distribution between Reloc-A and Reloc-B. This result is consistent with Jacobson et al. [2006] who used WWLLN data from 2005 to show that the improving detection efficiency alters the total lightning but is unlikely to significantly affect the lightning variation. [Saffir, 1973; Simpson, 1974] . Their tropical cyclone subset had 40% of cyclones in the West Pacific and included cyclones in the West Atlantic, East Pacific, and Indian Oceans. Price used WWLLN to determine the total lightning within the tropical cyclone using a 10"}, {"section_title": "Recreating the Results of", "text": "\u2022 \u00d7 10\n\u2022 square window centered on the eye. The maximum sustained wind and pressure data for each cyclone was taken from the National Hurricane Center and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center with 6 h resolution and then smoothed using a 24 h running average. The same averaging method was used on the lightning data by collating the submicrosecond resolution lightning strike data into 6 h totals and then applying a 24 h running average. A comparison between average wind speeds and lightning strike rate was then performed.\nPrice reported a positive correlation (r = 0.82) of strong significance (>90%) between the variation in winds and lightning for 56 of the 58 cyclones. The peak correlation had a variable time offset, with the lightning leading the winds by as much as 6 days in some cases, and in others the lightning lagged the winds by up to 3 days. The mean and median lead time of the lightning variability was reported as 30 h. When each tropical cyclone was compared using this 30 h lead time, 31 events showed a positive correlation with 19 of these showing a statistical significance > 90%. We begin by comparing the IBTrACS database to the WWLLN lightning data for the Price storm set."}, {"section_title": "Reanalysis of the Data", "text": "Using IBTrACS, 38 of the 58 cyclones used by Price have a maximum sustained wind speed below the 114 kt category 4 limit defined by the Saffir-Simpson scale. Using tropical cyclone \"Sonca\" as an example, Price's supplementary material showed that the smoothed peak winds reach \u223c115 kt, whereas the unsmoothed IBTrACS maximum wind speed for this cyclone is only 100 kt (the smoothed peak is 90 kt). The Sonca winds in Price develop the same way over time as the IBTrACS data, showing a single wind peak just before 25 April 2005, although there is a constant offset in wind speeds at all times. It should be noted that these 38 cyclones with a maximum sustained wind <114 kt still fall under the Hong Kong Observatory classification of a \"severe typhoon\" (equivalent to a category 4 classification with a lower limit of 81 kt). However, we note that the magnitude differences between Price and IBTrACS are not important in this study as the cross-correlation procedure to determine peak lag and lead times involves subtracting the mean from each data set, centering the data around 0 regardless of its original magnitude.\nWe begin, in a similar style to Price, with Hurricane Dennis. This tropical cyclone was tracked between 5 and 15 July 2005. To perform the running average, we initially attempted using the average of four time bins (a 24 h period); however, an even number of bins requires an interpolated time value to be used. This interpolation was tested and did not reproduce the Price wind and pressure results. The number of bins was increased to 5 (a 30 h period), allowing use of whole time bins and correctly reproducing the wind and pressure variation. The wind and pressure variations in Hurricane Dennis is shown in panel Figure 2a . However, the lightning strike variation using the same 30 h average approach produces different results from Price as shown in Figure 2b The wind and pressure plot we have produced in Figure 2a looks very similar to the Price wind and pressure in Figure 2c ; this suggests that the IBTrACS database for wind and pressure is equivalent to the database that Price used and that we have reproduced Price's method correctly. We see a similar shape in the smoothed lightning activity with the second peak at approximately the same activity rate as Price. However, the initial lightning activity peak is lower than Figure 2d , and the third peak is much higher. We have attempted multiple methods to reproduce Price's values including the following: median averaging, larger and smaller time windows to average over, different total lightning flash bin sizes, introducing bias to the averaging, and using older WWLLN products with no improvement. The reproduction of Hurricane Dennis has been independently performed by three of the authors, and all have reproduced the variability shown in Figure  2b . We perform a cross correlation of the wind and lightning strike data seen in our Figure 2 , taking the time difference associated with the peak value, then shift the two data sets and perform a linear correlation. We use a t test with a null hypothesis (Student's t test) to calculate the significance value. For Hurricane Dennis, we find that the lightning leads the winds by 30 h with a correlation of 0.96 and a statistical significance over 99.9%. This is very close to the Price values for this storm of 24 h and a correlation of 0.95. The small differences are most likely to arise from our inability to perfectly reproduce the Price lightning curve. The direct wind to pressure correlation was also calculated giving a linear correlation value of \u22120.98.\nWe repeated this process for all 58 tropical cyclones in the Price data set but included two extra conditions. The first condition is that the first and last two time bins of the wind and lightning data are removed after the running average is performed. This removal ensures that the data points which do not have sufficient neighboring values to average over are not included. The second condition is that the cross-correlation time difference between the lightning and wind values are limited to +6 days and \u22123 days as Price reports no differences outside these limits. Our analysis of the direct wind and pressure relation is highly negatively correlated as we expect from nonindependent variables, with a mean correlation of \u22120.988 and median correlation of \u22120.993. The varying lightning to wind correlations for the Price cyclones are given in Figure 3a . Each tropical cyclone is given a symbol similar to Price's Figure 4 , based on the statistical significance of the result as shown in the legend. The average correlation of the 58 cyclones has a mean of 0.72 and median of 0.74, in comparison to the mean correlation value of 0.82 given by Price. Three cyclones (\"Khanun, \" \"Sidr, \" and \"Wipha\"') have a statistical significance < 90% (\u223c85% for all three). Our analysis of the direct wind and pressure relation is shown in Figure 3b and is highly negatively correlated as expected. The mean linear correlation of the wind to pressure variation is \u22120.988, and the median correlation is \u22120.993. Figure 3c shows the distribution of the tropical cyclone lag data for comparison to Price's Figure 3 . Here a positive lag indicates that the lightning variation leads the wind variation. The time resolution of the lag distribution is set to 6 h (grey bars). Again, the distribution does not match the specific values seen in Price. A summation of the distribution in Figure 3 in Price exceeds 200%, suggesting some errors in this figure. Despite the difference, we still find mean and median lag times close to the 30 h values reported by Price. The mean lag time for our analysis is +24 h with a median value of +27 h. These average lag times are indicated in Figure 3c by the solid (mean) and dashed (median) lines. As a final test the three cyclones with statistical significance less than 90% are removed and the averages recalculated, giving little change to the mean lag (+24 h) and providing a median lag of +24 h. Smoothing the lag distribution data across five bins (30 h, solid blue line) produces a distribution which looks closer to Price's Figure 3 .\nWe conclude that while the results presented by Price cannot be completely reproduced, the reanalysis does indicate that there is a moderate to strong correlation between lightning and wind variations, with the lightning leading the wind by 30 h."}, {"section_title": "Repeating the Method for a Larger Subset of Storms", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Identifying Tropical Cyclones", "text": "The analysis approach from section 2.2 is now extended to a larger and longer tropical cyclone data set initially to test if the 3 year subset is a representative sample. We then use this larger data set to investigate \u2022 longitude both sides of the equator), and any other location (including the Mediterranean, which has been known to rarely generate events which appear to be tropical cyclones [Emanuel, 2005] ). The intensity classifications for each area are included in Table 1 with the maximum sustained wind speeds converted to knots. The difference in maximum sustained wind speed thresholds needs to be considered as average maximum sustained wind speeds vary strongly between basins (as shown in Figure 4 ). If we applied the hurricane wind thresholds, very few categories 4 and 5 cyclones that occurred in other basins would have been included. The intention of our study is to expand the tropical cyclones of Price in both time and basin origin. The hurricane classification is from the latest update of the Saffir-Simpson wind scale at the National Hurricane Center, the typhoon classification is taken from the Hong Kong Observatory and the Australian classification is taken from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. The classifications for the Indian Ocean basins are taken from the Indian Regional Specialized Meteorological Center, who uses seven categories (1 to 4, 5(i), 5(ii), and 6) for tropical storms. These have been matched up to be consistent with those of other agencies in Table 1 . For our larger cyclone data set only categories 4 and 5 tropical cyclones (equivalent to 5(ii) and 6 in the case of those with Indian Ocean basin of origin) will be included.\nThe basin of origin is determined by the latitude and longitude of the first maximum sustained wind speed data point in the IBTrACS database for each cyclone. We find 144 tropical cyclones which can be classified as category 4 or 5 between January 2005 and February 2013 (\u223c20% of the tropical cyclone list for these dates). The initial position of the 144 tropical cyclones is shown in Figure 4 with each basin region boundary identified. The color of each start position represents the peak maximum sustained wind speed of the cyclone ranging from 85 to 160 kt. All 58 cyclones in the Price data set passed the minimum sustained wind speeds to be classed as a category 4 or 5 tropical cyclone using the classifications in Table 1 and are included in this 8 year data set, along with an extra five cyclones from this time period which were also identified and included. Figure 5a shows the 8 year data set in a similar style to Figure 3a . The x axis indicates the start date of the tropical cyclone instead of the name of the storm. Each data point symbol relates to the category of the tropical cyclone as this provides more relevant information than the significance symbols. The linear correlation and optimal lag was compared for the maximum sustained wind speed, basin of origin, and the mean/median/total lightning strikes in the cyclone with no significant differences observable. There are two tropical cyclones not plotted which have a negative correlation value (\"Carina\" in 2006, r = \u22120.15 and \"Roke\" in 2011, r = \u22120.35). The mean (0.74) and median (0.78) linear correlations are very close to the 3 year data set of Price shown in Figure 3a , indicating that the Price tropical cyclones are a fair sample of the larger population. Figure 5b shows the distribution of lag times in a similar style to Figure 3c . Once again the mean (29 h) and median (30 h) lags are very similar to the \u223c1 day timescale discussed in both Price and DeMaria et al. [2012] . The supporting information included with this manuscript includes the name, basin, linear correlation, and lags for each of the 144 cyclones used in this study."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of the 8 Year Tropical Cyclone Data Set", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Lightning Strike Collection Window", "text": "To collect the 6 h lightning strike totals, Price used a 10 \u2022 \u00d7 10 \u2022 square window. Up to now we also used the same window size and shape but now investigate a window more suited to the shape of a tropical cyclone. The 10 \u2022 \u00d7 10 \u2022 square is changed to a circular window with a radius set in kilometers rather than degrees. At the equator 10\n\u2022 is \u223c1100 km so we rerun the analysis on the 8 year data set for radii ranging from 500 km down to 100 km in 100 km increments as well as a 50 km radius. A range of toroidal rings were also calculated.\nA comparison of the circular to square window is performed by investigating the 500 km radius circular window centered on the cyclone. The distribution of lags for this radial window is shown in Figure 5c . In section 2.2 we described an initial condition limiting the cross correlation to +6 and \u22123 days to match the Price approach. We now remove this limitation for analysis of the individual circular lightning collection windows. The lag distribution smoothing (e.g., Figures 5b and 5c) is also reduced to a more conservative three-bin distance (18 h). The cross correlation and linear correlation were performed for each cyclone and lightning radial distance window described above. The 300 km radius window resulted in the highest linear correlation of lightning to wind variability with r = 0.80, shown in Figure 6a . Each radial distance collection window with the average correlations and lags are shown in Table 2 . Investigation of the < 500 km radial window shows that the conditions implemented to reproduce Price (limiting the peak lag to between +6 and \u22123 days) makes a large difference to the average lag time. The lags found outside the limit times could be caused by a failure of the cross-correlation procedure, and we investigate this in section 4."}, {"section_title": "Fixed Time Lag Correlations", "text": "In the previous section we have shown that a circular window with a radius of 300 km produces the highest average correlation. In Figure 6a the distribution is bimodal with a mean and median value sitting between the modal peaks. As it is not possible to know which lag to use on a case by case basis, we proceed to calculate correlations for fixed time lags. These are related to the peaks in the distribution, and we test 0 h (modal value), 6 h (modal smoothed peak), 30 h (median value), and 66 h (second modal smoothed peak).\nThe average results of this fixed time lag correlation analysis are shown in Table 3 . Each row gives the mean and median correlations for each fixed time. Averages by basin and wind speed are also included in the table. It should be noted that five tropical cyclones did not contain a long enough time series to be able to perform a 66 h lag successfully, and these cyclones have been removed for this particular fixed time correlation. The results in Table 3 show that the best median correlation for all cyclones comes from the 66 h fixed time lag. This is also true for individual basins. However, we found this did not hold when we investigated the maximum sustained wind speed of the cyclones. The median maximum sustained wind speed of all cyclones was 105 kt, and so the data set was split on either side of this median. The tropical cyclones with maximum sustained wind speeds \u2265 105 kt showed the highest median correlation for a 30 h lag, although the 66 h lag was only slightly less correlated.\nThese data are shown in more detail in Figure 7 , with the four fixed lag times in each panel (0 h at top left, 6 h at top right, 30 h at bottom left, and 66 h at bottom right). The solid black line shows the median correlation for all cyclones, and the red and blue dashed lines represent the fast and slow maximum sustained wind medians Table 3. given in Table 3 . The spread of cyclone correlations is high for all four fixed lag times, although the medians clearly show that the highest correlations occur at the 66 h time period."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We find broadly similar results to Price when we extend their approach to a longer 8 year data set of tropical cyclones. However, while the typical linear correlations give values in the range of 0.7 to 0.8, this does not necessarily indicate a true ability to match the evolving wind and lightning variation. Visual inspection of each of the 144 cyclones was performed to investigate the accuracy of the cross-correlation procedure. We plotted the following: the lightning against winds in a similar style to Figure 2b , the lag times against cross-correlation value, and the time shifted lightning data with wind data to determine the accuracy of the variation matching process. This inspection found three cyclones where the wind and lightning variation show no similarities and a further eight instances of the cross correlation performing poorly, giving a failure rate of \u223c8%, this relates to cyclones with low total lightning strikes and those with no changes over the cyclone lifetime. The two sources of cross-correlation failure were double-peaked winds with the lightning peak(s) linked to the wrong wind peak and lightning data which had a sharp lightning strike gradient at the beginning or end of the data (an example is shown in the supporting information). This large gradient in the 6 h lightning strike total, which a The first entry shows the number of events where the lightning peak follows the wind speed peak and hence can be potentially used for prediction purposes. occurs in cyclones with low total lightning strike rates, forced the cross-correlation procedure to match poorly and resulted in lags > 84 h and < \u221284 h (3.5 days). An example of a cross-correlation failure with this sharp lightning strike gradient is shown for tropical cyclone Daman in the supporting information.\nIn an attempt to improve the correlation method we switched to circular windows for lightning detection. The smoothing was also reduced down to three bins (18 h) as applying a 30 h lag 10.1002/2014JD022868 time along with the 30 h smoothing used in Price (and our subsequent reproduction) would introduce a large error. In section 3.3 we noted that a 300 km radius resulted in the best median linear correlation, shown in Figure 6a . While the mean and median lags show a value similar to that quoted by Price, the lags show a double peak distribution at +66 h (2.75 days) and 0 h, with these average values sitting between them. Taking the average provides little to no information in this specific case. We performed a fixed lag correlation analysis in section 3.4 looking at the full modal peak (0 h), both the smoothed modal peaks (6 and 66 h) and the median value of 30 h. The results shown in Table 3 and Figure 7 show that the highest correlations are for a fixed time lag of 66 h. The highest average correlations are 0.38 for hurricanes and 0.37 for Australasian basins with a 66 h lag.\nWe further investigate the bimodal peaks of Figure 6 by looking at radial distances smaller than 300 km. Figure 6b shows the < 50 km radial distance which has only a single clear peak between 0 and +6 h. Molinari et al. [1994] used a distance less than 40 km as corresponding to eyewall lightning in Hurricane Andrew, while Zhang et al. [2012] determined lightning at < 60 km was eyewall lightning. We can therefore assume that our < 50 km radial window is providing correlations predominately for eyewall lightning. Molinari et al. [1999] showed that lightning density in tropical cyclones is bimodal as a function of radial distance, with one distribution in the eyewall and the other in the rainband region (150-300 km). This double lightning distribution could be the main reason for the low average correlations in Table 3 as a double peak would lower correlations especially if the lightning enhancement is low. Investigation of other radial distances, including the 150-300 km region, provides no other single peaks in the lag distribution. When looking at the < 300 km circular window in Figure 6a , it is interesting to note that Pan et al. [2014] found a single modal lightning lag of +60 h (2.5 days) when looking at weak tropical cyclones in the Northwest Pacific (using a < 600 km radius window). DeMaria et al. [2012] also determined that inner core lightning outbreaks are \"a signal that an intensification is coming to an end\" (i.e., the peak winds have been reached).\nThe results of the fixed time lag analysis show that while certain modal times appear to exist, knowledge of which lag to use ahead of time is required to allow prediction. In an effort to provide better predictive power, we have determined the time between the maximum wind and maximum lightning strike rate for each tropical cyclone (using the 6 h resolution time bins). This is subtly different from the cross-correlation analysis which has focused upon matching the intensification and relaxation profile of the wind speeds and lightning strike rates. Table 4 shows the number of tropical cyclones which have their peak winds within a specified time difference from the time of the maximum lightning strike rate. The results show that 31% of the tropical cyclones have their peak winds occurring before the peak in lightning strike rate, such that the lightning peak cannot be used to predict the wind speed peak. Of the 69% of cyclones that have a peak lightning strike rate occurring before the time of the peak winds, almost 25% have a time difference of 24 h or less, while almost a half show a time difference within 48 h. This method of analysis is not as rigorous as the cross-correlation procedure due to reliance on the position of a single data point rather than a profile. However, it does provide a measure of probabilistic prediction.\nIn this study we have been taking the lightning flash totals at \u00b13 h either side of the given IBTrACS data time. This does not allow for storm motion in the 3 h giving an error in the distance of each lightning strike from the cyclone center. The cyclone translational speed will vary across individual events and also during the cyclone lifetime. Average tropical cyclone translational speeds range from 4 to 6 m s \u22121 which in a 3 h period corresponds to distances of 43 and 65 km, respectively [e.g., Kaplan and DeMaria, 2001; Elsner et al., 2010; Mei et al., 2012] . This error is negligible for the larger radius windows but is obviously important for the smallest 50 km window. It is important to remember though that this error is a maximum and the closer in time to the IBTrACS data point the flash occurs the smaller this positional error will be."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "We have recreated the Price approach for a set of 58 tropical cyclones but were unable to duplicate the exact results that were found in this study. However, we confirmed their broad conclusions that the observed lightning variability is correlated to wind variability and that on average, the lightning variation leads the wind variation by \u223c1 day. The Price approach has been extended from the original 3 years of data to an 8 year data set which returns broadly similar lag and correlation results when using a lightning collection window of 10\n\u2022 square or of 500 km radius. The cross-correlation matching between wind and lightning only has an \u223c8% failure rate. We have calculated both the 10\n\u2022 \u00d7 10\n\u2022 square lightning detection window, a radial distance in kilometers, and performed the lightning to wind cross correlation for a range of circular distances including toroidal rings. The highest correlations were found for the < 300 km radial window with a median linear correlation of 0.8. The calculated lag time for each tropical cyclone using this < 300 km collection window shows a double peak distribution at 0 and +66 h, at this smaller radius a median or mean lag is not appropriate. The eyewall lightning at distances < 50 km from the center of the storm provides only a single peak around a zero time lag.\nThese results suggest that the predictive timescale of lightning is highly dependent upon which region of the cyclone is investigated. When using a spatially large lightning collection window, our results agree with other studies of high-category tropical cyclones [e.g., Price et al., 2009; DeMaria et al., 2012; Pan et al., 2014] of a \u223c1 day value. When we look at the region containing the eyewall, we find a 0 day value, indicating that eyewall lightning cannot be used to predict wind intensification using this large temporal-scale binning method. A case by case study looking at much higher time resolutions near the eyewall would be required to look for a potential predictive ability. We note that our results suggest that if such a predictive relationship existed, it would provide no more than 6 h advance warning. When we consider the < 300 km region (rainband and eyewall) we find a double-peaked structure at \u223c3 days (agreeing with Pan et al. [2014] for weak tropical cyclones) and 0 days. This 0 day lag is independent of the eyewall correlation peak, confirmed by the 150-300 km window showing the same double peak structure."}]
