To determine the predictors of incidence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) (Adult Treatment Panel III criteria) and to determine if longitudinal changes in specifi c MetS components differ by age or gender in participants who developed versus those who did not develop MetS.\nA total of 506 men and 461 women (baseline age 52.4 \u00b1 17.5 years) from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging (BLSA) were followed longitudinally (at least two study visits), and censored when they developed the MetS or reported use of antihypertensive or lipid-lowering medications.\nResults. After a follow-up period of 6 years, the incidence of the MetS was 25.5% in men and 14.8% in women. As many as 66% of men and 73% of women with one or two altered MetS components at baseline did not develop the MetS. Predictors of developing MetS were higher baseline abdominal obesity or triglycerides and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (area under receiver-operated curve [AUC] = 0.84 in men, 0.88 in women). Addition of the rate of changes in MetS components over time slightly improved predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.94 in men, 0.92 in women). Men were more likely than women to have the MetS without obesity, whereas women were more likely than men to have the MetS without an altered glucose metabolism.\nThe patterns of MetS components and the longitudinal changes that lead to the MetS are different in men and women.

Thus, individuals who end up with the MetS are discriminated by their baseline values and rate of change in the MetS values.\nTo examine how baseline values of specifi c MetS components and their rates of change predict the incidence of MetS, we fi tted three parsimonious logistic regression models: the fi rst model only included baseline values of individual MetS components, the second model only observed The \" predictive \" components in the logistic models were not the most prevalent in participants developing MetS, nor showed the higher percentage increase from baseline to the time of development of MetS. For instance, elevated BP, which was not an independent predictor, was the most prevalent MetS baseline component (>80% in participants developing MetS) and increased three-to fourfold in prevalence from baseline to the time of MetS. Analogously, altered glucose levels showed the highest increase in frequency from baseline to follow-up (approximately 5-fold in men and 12-fold in women). The baseline prevalence of low HDL-cholesterol was similar to high BP and increased only 1.5-fold in both genders but was a signifi cant predictor of the development of MetS. Waist circumference, the strongest predictor of new-onset MetS, showed a similar increase over time as elevated BP but was altered in only half of new-onset cases of MetS."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this report, we describe the natural history of MetS by analyzing longitudinal changes in MetS components. The incidence of MetS was 25.5% in men and 14.8% in women after an average follow-up of 6 years. In comparison, the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study reported an incidence of 17.1% in men and 20.9% in women after a follow-up period of 5 years ( 12 ) . The enrolment of Hispanic women, who tend to be at particularly high risk of the MetS, and who comprised approximately 30% of the IRAS study population, might explain the higher incidence rate in women compared with our study ( 3 , 13 ) . The San Antonio Heart Study showed a 15% incidence of MetS in men and a 17% in women after 8 years of follow-up ( 14 ) . Although this large cohort also included many Hispanic participants, the threshold values used to defi ne the MetS criteria were higher than those indicated by ATP III for lipids (triglycerides \u2265 200 mg/ dL, HDL-cholesterol <35 mg/dL in men and <45 mg/dL in women), glucose (diabetic patients), and BP (BP \u2265 140/90 mmHg for systolic and diastolic, respectively).\nThe novel effort of the present study was predicting development of MetS in a community-living population. We found that baseline levels of waist circumference, HDLcholesterol, and triglycerides were able to predict the development of MetS over time with considerable discriminatory power ( c statistics = .84 for men and .88 for women) and that the addition of rate of changes of individual components of MetS only slightly improved the accuracy of the model. Interestingly, participants who subsequently developed MetS had greater abdominal obesity, higher triglycerides, and lower HDL-cholesterol than those who did not develop the MetS in both men and women. The IRAS Study investigators found that waist circumference, lower HDL, and proinsulin were associated with a signifi cantly higher risk of MetS, even after controlling for glucose tolerance ( 12 ) . Additionally, consistent with our fi ndings, they identifi ed waist circumference as the optimal predictor of MetS, with the most discriminating cut point at 102 cm in men and 88 cm in women ( 12 ) . Other longitudinal studies documented the pivotal role of obesity in the pathogenesis of MetS in different populations, although the defi nition of MetS adopted varied from study to study ( 14 -17 ) .\nThat waist circumference is a strong predictor of the incidence of MetS in both men and women but that an altered waist component was not the most commonly altered component in participants who developed the MetS suggests that when conditions characterized by malnourishment and cachexia are excluded, the MetS burden of visceral adiposity is not only above a certain waist size threshold value is also a continuous function of waist circumference .\nA second relevant fi nding of the present study was that the most frequently altered component, for example, elevated BP, was not a signifi cant predictor of the risk for developing MetS, although MetMS participants showed a higher rate of increase in SBP or DBP over time as compared with participants not developing MetS, and this was observed in all three age groups. In fact, this sort of \" dissociation \" may affect the decision-making process in a clinical setting tailored for preventing MetS and CV events.\nThe lack of correlation between incident MetS and elevated BP at baseline in our study cohort is not completely surprising. Hypertension is the most controversial component of MetS ( 18 ) . The high prevalence of elevated BP in the general population likely explains the frequent occurrence of elevated BP as an \" isolated \" component of MetS. Of note, many studies suggest that abdominal adiposity is a stronger predictor of high BP than total obesity ( 19 -24 ) and that the relationship between adiposity and higher BP is linear and is evident even in the nonobese range ( 25 ) . Thus, even small increases in waist circumference (below the threshold used in the NCEP criteria) signifi cantly increase the risk for developing hypertension ( 20 , 26 , 27 ) , which may help explain our fi nding that the prevalence of high BP was greater than the prevalence of high waist circumference. In this regard, it is noteworthy that SBP did not change with age in men who remained free of any of the other four MetS component risk factors.\nA notable, and perhaps unexpected, fi nding was that a large number of men and women with baseline alterations in one or two MetS components did not develop MetS (40.9% of men and 45.8% of women). This observation is new and should infl uence prevention strategies aimed to reduce the burden of CV disease and diabetes. In fact, our fi ndings indicate that many participants appearing at higher risk for developing MetS do not actually develop it. A possible explanation is that these participants may adjust their habits toward healthier lifestyles, such as increasing physical activity or changing diet, or both. The quest for a clinical marker has to deal with accuracy and discriminatory power of the marker but also with its costs and its practical adoption in clinical setting. In this context, measurement of waist circumference has been suggested as a key factor to monitor the progression toward MetS and may help to identify specifi c subjects who could be targeted for intensive CV prevention ( 28 ) . In fact, our study showed that every 5-cm increase in waist circumference is associated with a 70% higher risk for developing MetS over time. Nonetheless, although waist measurement is easy and not time consuming, waist is not routinely measured in clinical practice ( 29 ) .\nThe present study has some limitations. The fi rst is that the sample studied was predominantly Caucasian so that no conclusion can be inferred for the general population. An additional limitation of the present study is that we cannot ascertain whether participants developing MetS during the follow-up were already in a trajectory of change different from those who did not develop MetS. However, we investigated both baseline levels and rates of change in MetS components and this allowed to account both for the individual ' s distance on his or her \" hypothetical \" trajectory and for the slope and the rapidity of the change in the trajectory. Certainly, we assumed linearity of change in MetS components over time, and this itself may represent a limitation. An additional limitation is represented by the lack of information on the effects of medications (lipids or glucose lowering, antihypertensive) on the trajectory of metabolic syndrome components.\nIn conclusion, in the BLSA cohort the incidence of MetS was 25.5% in men and 14.8% in women after an average follow-up of 6 years. At baseline, participants who subsequently developed MetS had greater abdominal obesity, higher levels of triglycerides, and lower levels of HDLcholesterol than the two other groups in both men and women. Predictive factors were not necessarily the most commonly altered components of MetS. Average predicted changes are expressed as percentages to account for baseline differences in the MetS components among the three study groups."}]
