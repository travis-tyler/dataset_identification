The study of normal brain maturation and agerelated brain atrophy is crucial to better understand normal brain development and a large variety of neurological disorders. With the rise of the population age, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the cognitive changes that accompany aging, both normal and pathologic. Moreover, analyzing brain maturation and senescence during the entire lifespan may help to better understand the undergoing process on normal brain development and aging.\nDespite the large number of studies dedicated to brain trajectory analysis over the last decades, an important disagreement remains between existing results [Walhovd et al., 2011 [Walhovd et al., , 2016 . Some studies described early life increase of gray matter (GM) volumes followed by a decrease [Giedd et al., 1999; Lenroot et al., 2007; Raznahan et al., 2011] while other works described GM decrease all along the lifespan [Aubert-Broche et al., 2013; Brain Development Cooperative Group, 2012; Ducharme et al., 2016; Mills et al., 2016; Ostby et al., 2009 ]. An extensive review of these inconstancies can be found in Walhovd et al. [2016] . For white matter (WM) the picture is inverted, with a consensus for the early life period characterized by an increase. However, less consistent effect of age in adulthood has been reported [Fjell et al., 2014; Jernigan et al., 2011] . In addition, time of brain maturation is also different according to the studies [Groeschel et al., 2010; Hedman et al., 2012] . Discrepancies also exist for the shape of trajectories for cortical and subcortical structures, sometimes described as linear, U-shaped (curvilinear) or as more complex polynomial curves. Finally, sometimes sexual dimorphism is described in these studies and sometimes no gender difference is observed [Giedd et al., 1999; Lenroot and Giedd, 2010; Lenroot et al., 2007; Suzuki et al., 2005] . The lack of consensus on brain development and aging prevents us to better understand these highly complex and multifactor phenomena. The significant divergence between existing results is due to many factors.\nFirst, the use of restricted life periods (e.g., childhood [Brain Development Cooperative Group, 2012] , adolescence [Lenroot and Giedd, 2010; Vijayakumar et al., 2016] , adulthood [Ziegler et al., 2012] , etc.) makes difficult the comparison of results, and tends to favor simple models capturing only brain growth or aging. Thus, it prevents global understanding of brain modification across the entire lifespan. Up to now, no study covered the entire lifespan including babies from few months of life to elderly older than 90.\nSecond, the use of a limited number of scans for certain age range (especially at childhood) may produce unstable results limiting the reproducibility and accuracy of estimations. The large majority of previous studies used less than 100 subjects [Walhovd et al., 2011] , some studies used several hundreds of subjects [Brain Development Cooperative Group, 2012; Giedd and Rapoport, 2010; Mills et al., 2016; Ziegler et al., 2012] and very few studies used more than 1,000 subjects [Fjell et al., 2013; Potvin et al., 2016] .\nIn addition, the use of nonharmonized acquisition protocols, segmentation tools, labelling protocols [Walhovd et al., 2016] and volumetric measurements such as absolute volume [Brain Development Cooperative Group, 2012] , normalized volumes using intracranial volume [Good et al., 2002; Mills et al., 2016] , GM volume [Ziegler et al., 2012] , or z-scores [Ostby et al., 2009; Walhovd et al., 2011] , lead to a great discrepancy in reported results [Walhovd et al., 2011] . Moreover, some studies are based on crosssectional data while others on longitudinal ones. Consequently, this heterogeneity makes difficult the definition of normative values [Potvin et al., 2016] stressing the need of using harmonized protocols over large samples covering the entire lifespan.\nr Coup e et al. r r 5502 r Finally, the use of an exigent quality control in the whole measurement process plays a major role in the quality of the final estimated brain models. This step is often not considered enough, while the model estimation greatly depends on a careful quality control [Ducharme et al., 2016] .\nTherefore, one of the most important challenges in neuroscience is to provide a consensual and unified vision of brain maturation and aging. In this study, we have addressed the previously mentioned limiting factors. First, thanks to the new paradigm of BigData sharing in neuroimaging [Poldrack and Gorgolewski, 2014] , we have been able to use a very high number of samples (N 5 3,296) covering the largest lifespan period never studied (from few months to advanced age). Moreover, all the considered MRI scans obtained from several freely available databases were processed using the same advanced MRI processing pipeline [Manjon and Coupe, 2016] . Thanks to the last advances in image processing, images from different age ranges can be analyzed with the same tool. To get insight on brain maturation and aging at global (i.e., absolute volume) and brain scale (i.e., normalized volume), we have extensively analyzed our results using absolute volumes and relative volumes (normalized by total intracranial volume [TIV] ). Moreover, to prevent the estimated models to be affected by wrongly processed images [Ducharme et al., 2016] , we have used a demanding three stages quality control process. Finally, to be able to present a unified analysis of brain development and brain aging at the same time we considered hybrid models. Contrary to previous studies based on linear or low order polynomial models, we considered models enable to capture fast growth and complex degenerative processes. This is achieved by combining cumulative exponential function to model rapid growth with saturation resulting from maturation and low order polynomial function to model volume decrease caused by aging.\nBy putting all these elements together, we are able to show for the first time a global picture of brain trajectory across the entire lifespan. Our results suggest that most of the previous marked disagreements can be explained by the proposed analysis. Previous divergences seem mainly to result from restricted investigations over short periods of the entire life history. Indeed, as shown in the following, the analysis of subjects bellow 8 y of age is important to detect the maturation peak. Similarly, the analysis of subjects older than 80 y is necessary to observe the accelerated atrophy occurring at this age. We hope that the proposed unified analysis will help to reach a consensus on normal brain trajectory."}, {"section_title": "MATERIAL AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Datasets", "text": "In this study, we used 3D T1-weight MRI obtained from nine freely available databases covering the entire lifespan.

The volBrain system is a fully open access academic platform that we have developed during the last 5 y. This web-based platform offers to freely share our computational resources and our last image processing methods to all researchers over the world. Therefore, we used volBrain in this study since we perfectly know the software, the generated reports facilitate a fast first stage QC and we recently demonstrated its robustness and accuracy [Manjon and Coupe, 2016] . Recently, volBrain pipeline was compared with two well-known tools used on MR brain analysis (FSL and Freesurfer) showing significant improvements in terms of both accuracy and reproducibility for intrascanner and interscanner scan rescan acquisition [Manjon and Coupe, 2016] . Moreover, we knew that the system was able to process large dataset since volBrain provides automatic brain volumetry in less than 15 min (including the generation of a pdf volumetry report summarizing the volumetric results). Since its deployment (2 years ago), volBrain has processed online more than 37,000 MRI for more than 1,200 users.\nThe volBrain pipeline consists of a set of steps aimed to improve the quality of the MR images to analyze and to locate them in a common geometric and intensity space prior to perform segmentation at several anatomical levels [Manjon and Coupe, 2016] . In more details, volBrain pipeline includes the following preprocessing steps: (1) denoising using spatially adaptive nonlocal means [Manjon et al., 2010a] , (2) rough inhomogeneity correction using N4 method [Tustison et al., 2010] , (3) affine registration to MNI152 space using ANTS software [Avants et al., 2011] , (4) SPM-based fine inhomogeneity correction [Ashburner and Friston, 2005] , and (5) histogram-based intensity standardization. After the preprocessing, the intracranial cavity is segmented using NICE method [Manjon et al., 2014] , tissue classification is performed using TMS method [Manj on et al.,, 2010b] and finally subcortical structures are estimated using an extended version of the nonlocal label fusion method [Coupe et al., 2011] . All the segmentation methods of volBrain use a library of 50 experts manually labelled cases (covering almost the whole lifespan) needed to perform the labeling process at different levels. More details can be found in [Manjon and Coupe, 2016] ."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "The statistical analysis was performed with Matlab V C software. In order to determine the best general models for each structure, several models were tested from the simplest to the most complex on all the dataset (i.e., female and male at the same time). A model is kept as a potential candidate only when F-statistic based on ANOVA for model vs. constant model is significant (P < 0.05) and when all its coefficients are significant using t-statistic (P < 0.05). At the end of the selection procedure, we used the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to select the best model among models being significant compared to constant model and having all coefficients significant. BIC provides a measure of the trade-off between bias and variance and thus select the model explaining most the data with minimum parameters. Afterwards, this general model type is applied on female and male separately to estimate gender specific models. At the end, to study In the literature, structure trajectories have been mainly modeled using low order polynomial function [see Walhovd et al., 2011 for review). However, to follow structure trajectories across the entire lifespan, we propose to consider hybrid models able to track rapid growth during childhood and to capture complex volume decrease from adulthood to elderly. In the past, fast growth modelling occurring during childhood has been achieved using Poisson curve [Lebel et al., 2012] or Gompertz-like function [Makropoulos et al., 2016] . Here, we propose to combine a cumulative exponential function in place of Gompertz-like function, and to combine it with low order polynomial function. At the end, our hybrid models can model fast growth process and complex volume decreases at the same time."}, {"section_title": "Quality Control", "text": "As recently shown, the quality control (QC) of image processing pipeline has a critical impact on trajectory results [Ducharme et al., 2016] . Therefore, in this study we decided to use a demanding multistage QC procedure for a careful selection of the involved subjects. First, a visual assessment of input image quality was done for all considered subjects. This assessment was performed by checking screen shots of one sagittal, one coronal and one axial slice in middle of the 3D volume. This step led to remove 219 subjects from the 3,296 considered subjects in our study (6.6%). Next, a visual assessment of the image processing quality for all remaining subjects was performed using volBrain reports (see an example of report here: http:// volbrain.upv.es/example_report.pdf). This report provides screenshots of one sagittal, one coronal and one axial slice at middle of the 3D volume for each step of the processing pipeline. All these steps (full head coverage including cerebellum, registration to MNI space, TIV extraction, tissue classification, subcortical structure segmentation, etc.) were carefully checked. This step led to remove 83 subjects from our study (2.5%). Finally, a last control was performed by individually checking all outliers detected using estimated trajectories. A volume was considered as outlier when its value was higher/lower than 2 standard deviations of the estimated model. For each detected outlier, the segmentation map was opened and displayed over the MRI using a 3D viewer [Yushkevich et al., 2006] . A careful inspection was performed over the 3D volume. In case of segmentation failure, the subject was removed from the study. This last QC step led to remove 50 subjects (1.5%).

As it can be noticed, the WM growth at early ages is faster than the senescence at late ages. This is assessed by the selected hybrid model (P < 0.001) combining an exponential cumulative distribution model for growth and a cubic model for aging (see Table II ). Conversely, although the same model is selected for GM (P < 0.0001), its trajectory is more complex. We can observe a 4-stage trajectory composed of a fast growth until 8-10 y followed by a fast decrease until 40 y, then a plateau and finally an accelerated agingrelated decrease is visible around 80 y.

It is interesting to note that despite the normalization, the WM growth remains very fast at the brain scale for early age with a hybrid model using an exponential cumulative distribution model for growth.

First, we estimated the deep GM volume by adding the GM volume of the considered deep structures (i.e., caudate, thalamus, accumbens, globus pallidus, putamen, hippocampus, and amygdala). The cortical GM was estimated as the global GM volume (as used in the paper) minus the deep GM volume. Figure 4 shows the estimated trajectories using absolute volume and normalized volume in % of TIV. At the global scale, we can observe that after their maturation peaks, deep and cortical GM volume decreases. However, deep GM volume decreases with almost a constant rate while cortical GM volume follows a more complex trajectory similar to the four-stage pattern already described for global GM.

At the brain scale, selected models are different between cerebrum WM and cerebellum WM. The hybrid model selected for WM cerebrum indicates a faster volume increase for this structure compared to WM cerebellum. The faster maturation during childhood of WM cerebrum is also visible on Figures 5 and 6 . The threestage trajectory obtained for global GM is observed for cerebellum GM and cerebrum GM. However, the plateau occurring at adulthood appears earlier for cerebellum than for cerebrum. Finally, the atrophy rate of normalized cerebrum volume is faster than cerebellum one.\nr Coup e et al. r r 5512 r polynomial senescence were selected for 8/10 of the investigated brain regions when absolute volumes are used. Moreover, the absolute global GM volume follows a complex trajectory with four phases: (1) rapid increase from 0 to 8-10 y, (2) rapid decrease until 40, (3) a plateau from 40 to 80 y, and (4) a rapid decrease after 80 y. Conversely, low order polynomial models better fit when volumes normalized by TIV are used, except for WM (see Tables II  and III) . When global growth effect is corrected, normalized global GM volumes decrease all over lifespan and follow a complex shape with three phases: (1) a rapid decrease from 0 to 20 y, (2) a plateau from 40 to 80 y, and (3) a rapid decrease after 80 y. This decline of the normalized global GM volume is consistent with the well-known fact that most of the neurogenesis is a prenatal phenomenon [Stiles and Jernigan, 2010] . In contrast, WM presents a shape close to the usually described inverted U-shape [Walhovd et al., 2011 ] that persists after controlling for head size. This result indicates that during the early phase of brain development WM expansion exceeds general growth. The fast simultaneous WM maturation and GM decrease at brain scale from childhood to adolescence are consistent with brain myelination period and cortical thinning process previously observed ex vivo [Huttenlocher and Dabholkar, 1997] . When considering cortical GM and deep GM separately, they exhibit a different pattern at both global and brain scales. At brain scale, deep GM shows almost a linear decrease while cortical GM trajectory follows the three identified stages for the global GM (see Fig. 4 ). The steeper decrease of normalized volume for cortical GM in the 0-20 y period (compared to the almost linear dynamics of the deep GM) is probably due to the very high pruning rate of the exuberant connectivity generated in the cerebral cortex [Stiles and Jernigan, 2010] or is due to myelination of nearby subcortical WM fibers [Jernigan et al., 2011] .\nOne of the most marked discrepancy in the literature is about the cortical GM trajectory over childhood [Walhovd et al., 2016] . First studies reported an increase with maturation peak in early school age [Giedd et al., 1999; Lenroot et al., 2007; Raznahan et al., 2011] . However, mainly monotonic decrease from early childhood have been recently published [Aubert-Broche et al., 2013; Brain Development Cooperative Group, 2012; Ducharme et al., 2016; Mills et al., 2016; Ostby et al., 2009] . The first factor that could explain this pronounced divergence is the used volume measurement. In this study, we showed that absolute GM volume follows a 4-stage trajectory with a maturation peak while normalized GM volume follows a three-stage trajectory exhibiting a decrease all along the lifespan. Therefore, our results are in line with [Giedd et al., 1999; Groeschel et al., 2010; Raznahan et al., 2011; Shaw et al., 2008] using Figure 6 . Trajectory of the cerebellum, cerebellum GM and cerebellum WM volumes in cm 3 and % of TIV across the entire lifespan. These volume trajectories are estimated according to the age on 2,944 subjects from 9 months to 94 y. General model is in black, female model is in magenta and male model is in blue. Dots color represents the different datasets used in this study (see Fig. 1 \nr Towards a Unified Analysis of Brain r r 5513 r absolute measurement and are consistent with [Mills et al., 2016; Ostby et al., 2009 ] using normalized measurement. However, several studies reported monotonic decrease using absolute cortical GM volume over childhood [Aubert-Broche et al., 2013; Brain Development Cooperative Group, 2012; Ducharme et al., 2016; Mills et al., 2016; Sowell et al., 2003; Walhovd et al., 2016] . This result is in contradiction with studies dedicated to newborn period that report an increase of absolute GM over the first months of life [Groeschel et al., 2010; Holland et al., 2014; Makropoulos et al., 2016] . The fact that several studies did not detect GM maturation peak using absolute measurements seems to be related to two main factors, the lack of subjects younger than 5 y and the use of low order polynomial models. Indeed, most of the studies presenting monotonic decrease did not include subjects younger than 4 y making difficult the detection of GM volume increase over the first years of life. Moreover, this implies that the model fitting was mainly driven by subjects with already mature brains [Aubert-Broche et al., 2013; Brain Development Cooperative Group, 2012; Ducharme et al., 2016; Mills et al., 2016; Sowell et al., 2003; Walhovd et al., 2016] . In addition to this potential issue on the used age range, most of these studies were using linear, quadratic or cubic models. Low order polynomial models are not welldesigned to capture complex shape such as fast growth with saturation before nonlinear decrease. In our study, we tried to address these two limitations by using subjects younger than 4-y old and by considering hybrid models able to handle complex brain change occurring during the first years of life. Finally, it is interesting to note that our results are in line with another study presenting GM trajectory from infancy to young adulthood based on nonlinear piecewise polynomial model [Groeschel et al., 2010] .\nDeep GM structures are the focus of a great interest due to their important role in various neurodegenerative diseases, and thus have been intensively studied in the past [Fjell et al., 2013] . Nonlinear trajectories of these structures have been previously described for adulthood [Fjell et al., 2013; Ziegler et al., 2012] . More recently, studies taking advantage of the \"BigData sharing\" in neuroscience started to analyze subcortical structure volumes from 20 y up to advanced ages to define normative values for adult lifespan [Potvin et al., 2016] . However, the limited age range of these studies made impossible to estimate full lifespan models. In this study, we have addressed this important problem by considering subjects covering the entire lifespan. Moreover, we extensively analyzed structure trajectories using both absolute and normalized volumes. Therefore, our results present at the same time the structure maturation peaks occurring during childhood based on absolute volumes and the accelerated atrophy related to aging occurring after 80 y obtained using normalized volumes. In addition, when deep GM structures are considered at the brain scale, their trajectories present a similar global decrease all along life, except for the medio-temporal regions with a late decrease for amygdala (after 70-y old) and an inverted U-shape for hippocampus. Moreover, an unexpected slight increase of caudate and putamen absolute volumes is visible after 80 y. Such observations have been already reported and questioned in several studies [Fjell et al., 2013; Potvin et al., 2016; Walhovd et al., 2011] . Different hypotheses have been proposed such as bias related to survival of subjects with bigger structures, cohort effect, image artifact related to aging or a real phenomenon [Potvin et al., 2016] . In our opinion, such volume increases at late ages can be also related to the use of global parametric model with less samples for very old subjects.\nThe understanding of the amygdalo-hippocampal complex is important in neurology since it is related to crucial tasks such as memory, spatial navigation, or emotional behavior. Moreover, hippocampus has been largely studied due to its use as an early biomarker in several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease [Fox et al., 1996; Jack et al., 1997] but also because it is the main TABLE IV.

Noteworthy, while amygdala and hippocampus are often associated due to their respective contribution to the limbic system, it appears that they present different trajectories. This fact has been previously reported in recent studies [Fjell et al., 2013; Pfefferbaum et al., 2013; Potvin et al., 2016; Ziegler et al., 2012] . The long maturation period of the hippocampus may be related to the adult neurogenesis. In fact, it has been shown that neurogenesis in the human hippocampus is substantial until at least the fifth decade of life [Spalding et al., 2013] , a finding consistent with our analysis. In contrast to the hippocampus, early maturation of the amygdala is consistent with its known function in emotional learning, which allows individuals to avoid aversive events and pursue rewarding experiences [Phelps and LeDoux, 2005] . Accordingly, the amygdala in humans has been shown to be functional early in life [Tottenham and Sheridan, 2009] . Our results on amygdala are in accordance with most of the previous studies highlighting a minor effect of aging over adulthood [Walhovd et al., 2011] .\nAnother important question about brain maturation and aging is related to sexual dimorphism. In the past, this question has been studied mainly over childhood development [Aubert-Broche et al., 2013; Brain Development Cooperative Group, 2012; Giedd and Rapoport, 2010] or during adolescence [Hu et al., 2013; Lenroot and Giedd, 2010; Lenroot et al., 2007; Ostby et al., 2009] . As previously mentioned, studies on different limited time periods, using nonharmonized tools and different volumetric measurements prevented reaching a consensus. In our study, when using absolute volume, we found that brain structure maturation peaks occur before for female than for male (between 1 y and 3 y earlier). These earlier peaks in females in the maturational phase have been previously described [Giedd and Rapoport, 2010] and were mainly explained by sex differences in growth. We also found a difference around 10-12% of brain size between sexes as previously reported by in vivo or postmortem studies [Brain Development Cooperative Group, 2012; Lenroot and Giedd, 2010] . Conversely, when the impact of brain size is compensated for, both sexes exhibit more similar trajectories. Only the normalized volume of nucleus accumbens presents a marked sexual dimorphism. This region is a key structure in the neural circuitry of addiction, a phenomenon well-known to show sex differences [Becker and Hu, 2008] . However, sexual dimorphism of the accumbens volume in humans has not been (to our knowledge) described before. In rats, a higher density of dendritic spines has been shown in females [Forlano and Woolley, 2010] . If a similar sex difference would exist in humans, it would be so subtle that only very large experimental samples would reveal it, as it is the case in the present study. Finally, we found that for several structures males are more impacted by aging than females especially after 70 y. The fact that women may be less vulnerable to age-related atrophy has been previously reported [Carne et al., 2006; Coffey et al., 1998; Gur et al., 1991] . This phenomenon may be related to the protective effect of estrogens and progesterone [Green and Simpkins, 2000] or related to the fact that women present fewer risk factors (hypertension, tobacco, alcohol consummation, etc.)."}, {"section_title": "Deep Gray Matter Structure Trajectories", "text": "Thalamus, accumbens, caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus trajectories\nAt global scale, we observe that thalamus, accumbens, caudate and putamen follow similar trajectories with fast growth until 10-12 y followed by a volume decrease. All selected hybrid models combine an exponential cumulative distribution for growth followed by low polynomial order for volume loss during aging, cubic for caudate (P < 0.0001) and putamen (P < 0.0001), quadratic for thalamus (P < 0.0001), and linear for accumbens (P < 0.0001) (see Table II ). Conversely, globus pallidus volume decreases from birth all along lifespan (quadratic model with P < 0.0001). Unexpected slight increases of caudate and putamen volumes are visible after 80 y. At the brain scale, we can see that thalamus, accumbens, caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus show a volume decrease across the entire lifespan. First, thalamus and accumbens exhibit almost monotonous decrease although cubic models have been selected (both with P < 0.0001). Second, caudate and putamen present similar slowdown decreases after 50 y. The similar trajectories of the caudate and putamen are consistent with their shared nature as dorsal striatal structures [Paxinos and Mai, 2004] . The model selected for these structures is cubic for caudate (P < 0.0001) and quadratic for putamen (P < 0.0001; see Table III ). Finally, globus pallidus follows a cubic model (P < 0.0001) showing a fast decrease between 1 y and 30 y, followed by a plateau between 30 y and 80 y and then by an accelerated atrophy after 80 y."}, {"section_title": "Amygdala and hippocampus trajectories", "text": "At the global scale, amygdala volume shows a slight increase until 18 y-20 y followed by a long plateau that ends around 70 y, followed by an age-related atrophy. The selected hybrid model combines a volume increase following an exponential cumulative distribution and a volume decrease following cubic model (P < 0.0001). The hippocampus trajectory presents a fast volume increase until 8 y-10 y followed by a slow volume increase until 40 y-50 y before an atrophic period. Here, the selected hybrid model mixes a volume increase following an exponential cumulative distribution and then an inverted U-shape volume decrease (P < 0.0001). At the brain scale, amygdala volume trajectory follows a cubic model (P < 0.0001) with a plateau until 70 y followed by an atrophy. This result seems to indicate that absolute increase of amygdala volume during childhood is mainly related to brain growth. Moreover, using relative volume, hippocampus exhibit a very specific inverted U-shape trajectory compared to other analyzed subcortical structures. In our study, the hippocampus is the only structure showing volume increase until the middle period of human life. To better investigate this point, we performed a complementary analysis between 18 y and 70 y. We found that the impact of age on absolute HC volume is significant (P < 0.0001) and that the selected model is an inverted U-shape trajectory over this restricted period. According to our results, the hippocampal maturation stops around 50 y."}, {"section_title": "Figure 4.", "text": "Trajectory of the cortical and deep GM volumes in cm 3 and % of TIV across the entire lifespan.

Finally, increased atrophy rates for males after 80 y is assessed by CSF trajectory, which is the only brain compartment showing significant age 3 sex (P < 0.0001) over the entire lifespan using the considered model. At the brain scale, almost all gender volume differences vanish, except in favor of females for caudate (P 5 0.05) and thalamus (P 5 0.05) with marginal significance, and for accumbens (P 5 0.02) (see Table III ). Visually, we can observe bigger relative volume for female hippocampus almost significant (P 5 0.07; see Table III and Fig. 3) . Finally, for global GM, caudate, thalamus, globus pallidus and amygdala, trajectories of females seem to indicate a better resistance to the accelerated age-related atrophy occurring after 80 y. To investigate this point, we studied sex and sex 3 age interaction using all subjects with age > 70 y (i.e., 637 subjects composed of 292 males and 345 females). Models estimated using all the subjects (see Table II ) are applied over this considered restricted period to evaluate sex and sex 3 age interactions. We found that using normalized volumes, almost all studied structures show significant sex and sex 3 age interaction after 70 y with the exception of WM and amygdala (see Table IV )."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "One of the main questions related to brain tissue properties deals with gray and white matter development/maturation and age-related gray and white matter atrophy. Knowing when brain tissues stop to mature and when they start to degenerate are key questions in neurology [Sowell et al., 2003 ]. In the past, both questions have been mainly treated separately in the literature, preventing us to get a global picture of these join phenomena. Moreover, discrepancies between used volumetric measurements (absolute or relative) made difficult to reach a consensus on crucial questions about synaptogenesis and synaptic pruning or myelination and aging."}, {"section_title": "Towards a Consensus?", "text": "Marked discrepancies exist in the literature about the best fitting models to describe brain trajectories either in pediatric phase [Ducharme et al., 2016] or adulthood [Fjell et al., 2013] .

These volume trajectories are estimated according to the age on 2,944 subjects from 9 months to 94 y. General model is in black, female model is in magenta and male model is in blue. Dots color represents the different datasets used in this study (see Fig. 1 "}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "In our opinion, one of the strengths of our study is to use multiple datasets to be able to cover the entire lifespan. However, this point can be also viewed as a weakness since the use of multiple datasets may introduce bias. Indeed, pooling databases having different age ranges could lead to find artificial differences. It has to be noted that we limited this aspect by using at least two different overlapping databases for each 5 y intervals. Moreover, the preprocessing pipeline of volBrain has been designed to limit the impact of acquisition protocol by proposing advanced denoising filter and tissue-based intensity normalization. Therefore, after preprocessing, images are better homogenized in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and tissue contrast limiting the impact of using different acquisition protocols and scanners. In addition, during our QC all images with motion and ghosting artifacts were removed as well as the image having high anisotropic voxel resolution. Finally, several studies showed that agerelated volume differences are consistent between datasets when using the same analysis tool Mills et al., 2016; Walhovd et al., 2011] . Moreover, recent papers based on a large scale study over adulthood [Potvin et al., 2016 [Potvin et al., , 2017 showed that the impact of MRI scanner manufacturer and magnetic strength is negligible compared to impact of age of the structure trajectories.\nAfter our quality control step, no images of subjects younger than 9 months remained. Therefore, the newborn period is not well covered by our samples and thus results obtained before 9 months of life may be inaccurate. Few studies have been published on brain structure trajectory for this since the acquisition is difficult and the image analysis is very challenging due to low contrast before 6 months and fast myelination progression during the first 2 y of life [Gilmore et al., 2007 [Gilmore et al., , 2012 Groeschel et al., 2010; Holland et al., 2014; Makropoulos et al., 2016] . However, specific tools have been proposed to analyze the newborn life period [Makropoulos et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014] . Nevertheless, up to now, there is no large period lifespan study integrating newborn period with childhood, adolescence, adulthood and elderly.\nHere, we described different lifespan trajectories for deep versus cortical structures. Previous studies described heterogeneous trajectories for different parts of the cortex over restricted periods Pfefferbaum et al., 2013; Potvin et al., 2017; Sowell et al., 2003; Walhovd et al., 2016] . Therefore, we plan to investigate trajectory based on r Towards a Unified Analysis of Brain r r 5515 r cortex parcellation over the entire lifespan in a further study.\nFinally, we used cross-sectional analysis to study brain trajectory over the entire lifespan. Using cross-sectional data to analyze a dynamic process can be suboptimal. However, some evidences show that cross-sectional and longitudinal samples produce similar age-related patterns [Fjell et al., 2013] . Moreover, the reported lack of consensus is also observed among different longitudinal studies. For instance, the volume of cortical gray matter is highest in childhood according to some longitudinal studies [Mills et al., 2016] , but peaks at puberty according to others [Lenroot et al., 2007] . Therefore, the longitudinal or crosssectional nature of the data is another factor introducing variability but it is not the unique factor explaining the different results reported in the literature. It is interesting to note that most of the trajectories obtained in our crosssectional study are in accordance with previous longitudinal studies. First, for childhood, maturation peak between 8 y and 10 y for absolute cortical GM volume and earlier peak for females have been reported using longitudinal data [Giedd et al., 1999; Raznahan et al., 2011] . Moreover, for adolescence, an increase of the absolute WM volume and a decrease of absolute GM volume between 10 y and 20 y have been observed in previous longitudinal studies [ Aubert-Broche et al., 2013; Giedd et al., 1999; Mills et al., 2016] . Finally, for adulthood, our results on normalized subcortical structures volume are highly consistent with results presented in the longitudinal study published by Pfefferbaum et al. [2013] . Nevertheless, we think that in a further work, a mixed cross-sectional/longitudinal study [Giedd et al., 1999] could be done since some of the used datasets contain longitudinal data."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "We have presented an MRI volumetric brain analysis study covering the entire lifespan based on a very large number of subjects. In this study, we have dealt with main limitations of previous studies to offer a comprehensive analysis of maturation and aging effects at different brain tissues and structures. Absolute and relative measurements have been used to get a complete picture of the brain state at different development stages for both genders. Moreover, optimized models have been used to robustly characterize volume evolution of the different tissues and structures. The results of this study are very helpful to integrate several previous studies covering partial age ranges into a common framework. This enables a better understanding of the observed phenomena. Moreover, the use of the estimated models as normative values can be of inestimable help when analyzing the state of new subjects. Furthermore, disease specific estimated models can be directly compared to the normal models estimated in this study without needing to acquire and analyze a control group. We will include these models in our open access web platform volBrain to provide normality bounds based on the appropriate sex and age for the analysis of new cases. We hope that the online availability of the volBrain online service in combination with the presented models will help our understanding of both normal and pathological human brain.\nStudy at the University of California, San Diego.
