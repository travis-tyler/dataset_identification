[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The B2D program was established in 1992 as part of an effort to build a more diverse biomedical workforce. The B2D Program is part of a broader Bridges to the Future initiative, the goal of which is to retain students from groups historically underrepresented in the biomedical sciences, including individuals with disabilities, and ethnic and racial minorities (from here on referred to as underrepresented, or UR, students). These programs are administered by the NIGMS program staff in the Division of Training, Workforce Development, and Diversity (TWD). To enhance the diversity of the biomedical workforce, the Bridges to the Future programs focus on key transition points within students' careers, when they most commonly leave the scientific training \"pathway.\" The B2D program focuses on the Master's degree to PhD degree transition by helping students at Master's degree-granting institutions transfer to PhD degree programs. The program builds partnerships between PhD degree-granting institutions and terminal Master's degree-granting institutions that enroll large proportions of UR students. These partner institutions recruit and train Master's degree students and create a transfer agreement that allows students to continue on to the PhD after completing a Master's degree. Ultimately, by increasing the number of UR students who transition from a Master's to a PhD degree and by supporting trainees financially and academically, more UR students may be retained in the biomedical workforce. B2D R25 grants are awarded to a lead institution and at least one partner institution. This partnership must consist of at least one terminal Master's degree-granting and one PhD degreegranting institution. Universities recruit trainees and develop programs involving two main types of training activities: Courses for Skills Development (e.g., courses on research techniques or advanced subject matter) and Research Experiences (e.g., mentored lab research). Awards can last for a maximum of five years, are renewable, and are limited to $300,000 in direct costs per year. The program includes funding for activities, including part-time student support, research training, tuition remission, equipment, conference presentation, and administrative faculty and personnel support. In May 2018, NIGMS convened a panel of external experts as a working group of the National Advisory General Medical Sciences (NAGMS) Council to conduct an evaluation of the B2D program. As noted above, this panel focused on three broad questions, as well as a general discussion of the program, and concluded with an articulation of specific recommendations by each panel member."}, {"section_title": "Success of the B2D Program in bridging students to PhD degree-granting programs.", "text": "The first question the panel considered was \"Has the Bridges to the Doctorate program been successful in bridging Master's students to doctoral study?\" Overall, the panel felt the B2D program was moderately successful at enabling trainees to bridge into PhD degree programs. Data provided indicated that 55% of the trainees who had completed Master's training bridged into PhD degree-granting programs, which approached the goal of 60% stated in the FOA (Figure 1, Appendix). The committee, however, raised great concern on the incomplete and potentially inaccurate nature of the data provided. The lack, loss, absence, and coarse nature of the data made it difficult to critically and confidently evaluate the major questions posed and the overall performance and impact of the B2D program. For example, the status of 21% of trainees who had completed Master's degree training was unknown based on the latest information provided by grantee institutions. The inability of grantees to track and provide required information on such a large percentage of trainees reflected poorly on participating institutions and the overall mechanism. The data also indicated significant asymmetry in program success. About a handful or two of the programs appeared successful in helping trainees earn a PhD degree, but most programs failed in this regard (Figure 2, Appendix). The panel also expressed concern on the short half-life of most B2D programs (Figure 2, Appendix), which raised the question as to whether the B2D mechanism is generally viable at most targeted schools. The take home messages from the discussion were for the program to be more intentional, specific, and rigorous in collecting data on trainees, trainee outcomes, and institutional baselines, and for NIH to hold Program Directors' \"feet to the fire\" to do so."}, {"section_title": "Doctorate Success of Trainees from Underrepresented Groups", "text": "The second question the panel considered was \"Did the program successfully support UR trainees in earning PhD degrees?\" As with the first question, the incomplete and potentially inaccurate data provided by grantees made it difficult to reasonably answer this question. Still, based on data provided the panel expressed concern that the B2D program was underperforming in helping UR trainees earn the PhD degree. Data indicated that 57% of trainees who bridged into a PhD program earned a PhD degree (Figure 3, Appendix), which is well below the stated goal of 80% in the FOA and the 75-80% PhD degree completion rate observed at most top biomedical doctoral programs, but roughly approximates the Council of Graduate Schools 10-year PhD graduation rate of UR students in the life sciences. Additional data led the panel to question whether the 57% of bridged trainees who earned a PhD degree over-reported degree attainment. For example, ~9% of earned doctorates were in the field of nursing and education, not biomedical-related research fields, and two-thirds of trainees indicated by grantees as earning a PhD degree could not be independently verified by NSF's Survey of Earned Doctorates (Figure 4, Appendix). The panelists also raised concern that B2D trainees took an excessive time from graduate program entry to PhD completion, an average of 9 years -three years in a Master's program and six years in a PhD program (Table 1, Appendix). Rather than transferring into a PhD program at a partner institution and maintaining training and research momentum, B2D trainees appear to start the graduate education process over along with all incoming PhD students. Together these data made the panel question whether partner PhD degree-granting institutions had developed effective mechanisms to accommodate B2D trainees for their prior Master's training and research and also to support the persistence and success of these trainees in their graduate programs."}, {"section_title": "Success of Trainee Entrance into the Biomedical Workforce", "text": "The third question the panel considered was \"Was the program successful in encouraging a diverse pool of students to enter the biomedical research workforce?\" The data provided divided trainees into four career outcomes: educational services; health care and social assistance; professional, scientific, and technical services; and all others. The panel felt these groupings needed far greater resolution to rigorously assess program impact on promoting diversity in the biomedical workforce. At the resolution provided, the panel expressed mixed feelings with respect to the B2D promoting diversity in the biomedical workforce: 60-70% of B2D trainees entered the biomedical workforce, rates significantly higher than the average population (Table 2, Appendix), but the number of B2D trainees who pursued faculty positions in academic research appeared small. Of 298 B2D trainees who had NIH identifier numbers, 14 had applied for NIH predoctoral fellowships, one had applied for an NIH postdoctoral fellowship, and one had applied for an NIH K99 Faculty transition award (Table 3, Appendix). The panel viewed these latter numbers as discouraging."}, {"section_title": "Additional Panel Recommendations", "text": "A general discussion of the B2D Program at the end of the review identified four key observations and/or recommendations. \u2022 The panel viewed B2D Program success as highly asymmetric. A few of the 64 programs succeeded in supporting trainees to earn a PhD degree, but most failed to do this. A path forward could involve selecting the five or six most successful programs, performing an in-depth analysis on what makes these programs successful, and then evolving the B2D program to better align with the structure and activities of these programs. Here, significant attention should be paid to the importance of the PhD degree-granting partner institution, what they bring to the partnership/trainees, and whether their inclusion is essential for B2D success. \u2022 Although the panel was not enthusiastic about B2D program success, it felt it was important to support research-based programs that help create a research environment and culture at Master's degree-granting institutions, particularly those that serve a large number of UR students. \u2022 The panel voiced an urgent need to acquire complete, accurate longitudinal trainee data to facilitate critical evaluation of the B2D program. The current lack, loss, and coarse nature of data on many B2D trainees/programs greatly curtailed the panel's ability to critically and confidently evaluate the B2D Program's impact and performance. Increased support for data collection mechanisms that facilitate longitudinal tracking of trainees and their outcomes, such as centralized data collection centers, is essential for rigorous, critical assessment of training programs such as B2D. Increased attention to intentional collection of specific data from host institutions and nationally is critical for robust program assessment. Such baseline data on the rate at which Master's student's progress to completion of the PhD degree at host institutions and the rate at which college graduates with life-science majors enter the biomedical workforce, is essential for rigorous program assessment. \u2022 The panel called for benchmarking in head-to-head comparisons the NIGMS B2D Program against the NIGMS Post Baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) (R25) and the NSF Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Fellowship program (and other similar programs) to determine the success of each program in helping UR students matriculate into and to complete PhD degree programs. An important metric in this analysis would be \"cost per PhD degree,\" with the >$300K cost per PhD degree of the B2D program viewed as high by the panel."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Recommendations", "text": "The consensus of the panel was that if the primary goal of the B2D program is to increase the number of UR students who earn a PhD degree, then B2D had not proven itself highly effective. The two key recommendations of the panel were as follows: 1) benchmark the NIGMS B2D program against the NIGMS PREP and NSF LSAMP programs to identify the most successful, cost-effective mechanism(s) to increase UR PhD graduates, with a goal of reducing, remodeling, or phasing out the NIGMS B2D program; 2) direct additional resources toward enhancing data collection on trainees and trainee outcomes, as the absence of high-quality trainee data made it essentially impossible to critically evaluate the B2D program.    3) Doctoral Completion Outcomes: Top) Percentage of B2D trainees who bridged into a PhD program and their status or outcome. Bottom: Percentage of B2D trainees who had completed their training and their outcomes. N.B. \"Unknown\" refers to trainees who had been listed by the grantee as starting a PhD program, but who in a subsequent progress report or competitive renewal had been listed with an \"Unknown\" outcome or no information had been provided for the trainee."}, {"section_title": "APPENDIX: Supporting Material", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Figure 4)", "text": "Comparison Between Grantee PhD Completion Data (NIH) and NSF's Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED). Of the 159 trainees reported by grantees to have earned a PhD, approximately 50 were independently validated to have earned a PhD by NSF's SED, but approximately 110 trainees listed as receiving a PhD by grantee institutions were not confirmed to have earned a PhD by NSF SED data. NSF SED data, however, did identify approximately 70 additional B2D trainees who had received a PhD who had not been listed as receiving a PhD by grantee institutional data to NIH. Table 1) Time to Degree for B2D Trainees. B2D trainees took on average 9.06 years to complete the PhD from entry into any graduate program and 6.19 years to complete the PhD from entry into a PhD program. Data from NSF's SED indicate that students in the life science typically take on average about 7 years to complete the PhD from entry into any graduate program and 5.7 years to complete the PhD from entry into a PhD program.
