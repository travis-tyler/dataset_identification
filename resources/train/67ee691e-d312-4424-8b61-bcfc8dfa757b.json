Excluded from this sample, however, were special education schools, ungraded classrooms, and students determined by local staff to be incapable of participation in the survey for reasons of language or of mental or physical disability. As a result, as many as one-half of the children with disabilities who are served under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) were likely excluded from the NELS:88 base-year sample. Further information about how the counts of students with disabilities in the NELS sample compare to counts of students with disabilities under the IDEA and in national longitudinal studies can be found in Appendix A (see also OSEP 1994;Wagner et al. 1993). The primary purposes of this report are to identify those students in NELS:88 who had or may have had a disabling condition or received services related to such a condition, and to examine their characteristics and their educational experiences and outcomes, as they progressed from the eighth grade in 1988 into and out of high school in 1992. Another purpose is to examine the alternative perceptions of disability status that are available from the four different respondent groups in NELS:88 (parents, teachers, students, and school officials) and to assess the extent to which these various perceptions affect descriptions of the characteristics, experiences, and outcomes of students with disabilities. Using NELS:88 to Define Disability Status NELS:88 provides four different sources of information related to disability statusparents, teachers, students, and school officials. Each of these sources responded to different items relating to students' disability status. For example, teacher perceptions of students' disability status was linked to students' classroom performance, whereas parental identification was linked to whether or not a student had ever received disabilityrelated services. As a result, all of these data sources produce different estimates of the disabled population of students in grades 8-12."}, {"section_title": "Profiles of Students with Disabilities as Identified in NELS:88 iii", "text": "The degree of overlap among students who identify themselves or are identified by parents, teachers, or school officials as disabled is often quite lowthat is, the populations of students identified as disabled by these different sources appear to be somewhat separate and distinct groups of students.

Similar percentages of parent-identified disabled students and students in the nondisabled population were members of minority groups (23.7 and 26.9 percent, respectively). Among students identified as learning disabled by parents and teachers, teacher-identified students were more likely to be black than were parent-identified students (16.6 percent versus 7.9 percent, respectively). Black students were actually underrepresented among those students classified by parents as learning disabled. Students who identified themselves as disabled were more likely than their nondisabled counterparts to be male (60.8 percent versus 49.7 percent).

However, these students evidenced relatively low levels of participation in \"special education programs for the educationally or physically handicapped\" (between 2.0 and 11.2 percent). In addition, students identified by teachers as disabled participated in extracurricular activities to a lesser extent than nondisabled students. Students who identified themselves as disabled reported higher levels of participation in remedial English and mathematics programs than did their nondisabled counterparts (32.1 percent versus 18.7 percent and 42.9 percent versus 20.3 percent, respectively).

Among the different disability categories, students identified by their parents as having emotional problems recorded the lowest grades and the highest levels of school dropout. Teacher-and parent-identified students with multiple disabilities and learning disabilities recorded the lowest mathematics and reading proficiency levels.

These students were more often retained in grade, enrolled in remedial classes, and placed in dropout prevention programs. Perhaps as a result, they earned fewer credits in core curriculum areas, had lower educational expectations, and had higher dropout rates than nondisabled students on average. The severity of these sorts of education-related problems for disabled students did appear to vary by type of disabling condition. For example, students with emotional problems were shown to have among the highest dropout rates, while students with health problems compared most favorably with nondisabled students with respect to several types of outcomes. For these reasons, when the school experiences and outcomes of disabled students are examined, it continues to be important to collect information and carry out analyses separately for various specific disability categories. Relatively small percentages of students with disabilities as identified in NELS:88 perceived themselves or were identified by school officials as having received special education services during high school. The low reported participation rates in \"programs for the educationally or physically handicapped\" and in special education programs may raise questions concerning the adequacy with which students with special needs are identified and served in our nation's high schools, and the extent to which these students are being served in more inclusive environments that might affect their awareness of being in a \"special\" program. It should be noted, however, that not all children with disabilities need special school services; for example, a child with a purely physical disability who receives the proper medical services for that disability may not require special services. In addition, NELS:88 sampling procedures and instrumentation effectively may have removed from consideration many students who would typically receive services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and may have led to the identification of students at risk of educational failure generally as disabled students. Profiles of Students with Disabilities as Identified in NELS:88,v Teachers in NELS :88 were perceptive judges of which students were failing to perform well in the classroom, but linking the identification of disability status to classroom performance may blur the distinction between students with disabilities and students at risk. In NELS:88,teachers identified students as disabled only if their condition affected their school work. As a result, students whose disabilities did not affect their work would likely not have been classified by teachers as disabled, and students whose disability status might have been questionable but whose work in school was poor may have been classified by teachers as disabled. Despite this vagueness in disability definitions, teacher reports of student disability status often \"overlapped\" the reports made by different NELS:88 respondents. And, the students identified by teachers as disabled (in contrast to those identified by parents) also were found to have more of the sorts of personal characteristics, educational experiences, and records of achievement one might associate with students in need of special services (e.g., lower SES, higher participation in dropout prevention programs, lower gains in reading proficiency). In the future, however, it will be important for survey research efforts to separate perceptions of student disability status from their classroom performance. vi Profiles of Students with Disabilities as Identified in NELS:88  Tables   Table 2.1 Alternative definitions of disability status using NELS:88 15 Table 2.2 Overlap among populations identified as disabled by various data sources, for students present for NELS:88 base-year, first, and second follow-up surveys (unweighted percentages) 16 Table 3.1 Percentage of students with disabilities, as identified by parents and teachers, who were male, the percentage who were minority, and average age (NELS:88 Second Follow-up Student Survey) 19 Table 3.2 Percentage of students with disabilities, as identified by parents and teachers, who were of various races (NELS:88 Second Follow-up Student Survey) 21 Table 3.3 Percentage of students with disabilities, as identified by parents and teachers, who were in each SES quartile and had parents with various education levels (NELS:88 Base-Year Parent Survey) 23 Table 3.4 Percentage of students with disabilities, as identified by parents and teachers, who lived in single female-headed households (NELS:88 Base-Year Parent Survey) 24 Table 3.5 Mean locus of control scores, over time, of students with disabilities First,, as identified by parents and teachers 26 Table 3.6 Mean self-concept scores, over time, of students with disabilities First,, as identified by parents and teachers 26 Table 3.7 Percentage of students with disabilities, as identified by parents and teachers, who were in different school environments and who received free or reduced-price lunch (NELS:88 Base-Year School Survey) 28 Table 3.8 Percentage of students who identified themselves as disabled, who were male, members of minority groups, and in various SES quartiles (NELS:88 Base-Year Student and Parent Surveys) 29 Table 3.9 Mean self-concept and locus of control scores of students who identified themselves as disabled (NELS:88 Second Follow-up Student Survey) . . . 29 Profiles of Students with Disabilities as Identified in NELS:88 ix Table 4.1 ,Percentage of students with disabilities, as identified by parents and teachers, who ever repeated a grade prior to eighth grade (NELS:88 Base-Year Parent Survey) 32 Table 4.2 Percentage of students with disabilities, as identified by parents and teachers, who reported ever having participated in remedial English or mathematics programs during high school (NELS:88 Second Follow-up Student Survey) Table 4.3 Percentage of students with disabilities, as identified by parents and teachers, who reported having participated in high school dropout prevention programs (NELS:88 Second.

Students with disabilities as identified in NELS:88 were more often retained in grade, enrolled in remedial classes, and placed in dropout prevention programs. Perhaps as a result, they earned fewer credits in core curriculum areas, had lower educational expectations, and had higher dropout rates than nondisabled students on average. Given this general pattern of less positive experiences for disabled students, the severity of these sorts of education-related problems for disabled students did appear to vary by type of disabling condition. Throughout the chapters in this report, the distinctive needs and problems of learning disabled students and of students with multiple handicaps were noted. Students with emotional problems were also shown to have among the highest dropout rates, while students with physical problems were most similar to nondisabled students in overall grade averages. Students with health problems compared most favorably with nondisabled students with respect to several types of outcomes. For these reasons, when the school experiences and outcomes of disabled students are examined, it continues to be important to collect information and carry out analyses separately for various specific disability categories. Relatively small percentages of students with disabilities perceived themselves or were identified by school officials to have received special education services during high school. Overall, fewer than one-tenth of those students identified by parents or teachers as disabled reported ever having participated in a program for the educationally or physically handicapped during high school. School officials reported higher, but still relatively low, participation rates for these students in special education programs during high school. As discussed in chapter 4, these low reported participation rates may raise questions concerning the adequacy with which students with special needs are identified and served in our nation's high schools, and the extent to which these students are being served in more inclusive environments that might affect their awareness of being in a \"special\" program. It should be noted, however, that the NELS:88 base-year sample likely excluded many children with disabilities who are served under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Similarly, NELS:88 parent and teacher survey items related to disability status may have led to the identification of many students who would not be considered disabled under the IDEA. Teachers in NELS:88 were perceptive judges of which students were failing to perform well in the classroom, but linking the identification of disability status to classroom performance may blur the distinction between students with disabilities and students at risk. In NELS:88, teacher perceptions of disability status were linked to students' classroom performancei.e., teachers identified students as disabled only if their condition affected their school work. Nevertheless, teacher reports of students' disability status often \"overlapped\" the reports made by different NELS:88 respondents. For example, more than 70 percent of the students identified by school officials as having participated in special education in high school were also (and independently) identified as disabled by teachers. In addition, more than one-half of all students who reported their own participation in special high school classes for the educationally or physically handicapped were also identified as disabled by teachers, and almost one-half of the students identified as disabled by parents were so identified. At the same time, as summarized above, the students identified by teachers as disabled (in contrast to those identified by parents) also were found to have more of the sorts of personal characteristics, educational experiences, and records of achievement one might generally associate with students at risk of educational failure (e.g., lower SES, higher participation in dropout prevention programs, lower gains in reading proficiency). For this reason, in the future, it will be important for survey research efforts to separate teachers' perceptions of disability status from students' classroom performance. That is, although this form of identification allows us to benefit from teachers' perceptions of which children are performing poorly, as a method of identification for disability status, it may (1) include children who are performing poorly in the classroom but who are not necessarily disabled, or (2) exclude children who are disabled but whose school work is not affected by their disability."}, {"section_title": "47", "text": "Gains in IRT-estimated number right for reading and mathematics tests, Base Year to Second Follow-up, among students with disabilities (NELS:88 Base-Year and Second Follow-up Student Surveys), as identified by parents and teachers 48 Percentage of students with disabilities, as identified by parents and teachers, who held or whose parents held various levels of educational expectations (NELS:88 Second Follow-up Student and Parent Surveys) . . 50 Percentage of students with disabilities, as identified by parents and teachers, who reported that they had completed or intended to complete the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) or the American College Test (ACT)  Percentage of students with disabilities, as identified by parents and teachers, who dropped out of high school  53 Average high school grade in English, mathematics, and science, and percentage of students who identified themselves as disabled who dropped out of high school (NELS:88 Second Follow-up and Second Follow-up Transcript Component) 54 Percentage of students who identified themselves as disabled, who achieved various levels of proficiency in mathematics (NELS:88 Second Follow-up Student Survey) 54 Percentage of students who identified themselves as disabled, who achieved various levels of proficiency in reading (NELS:88 Second Follow-up Student Survey)"}, {"section_title": "55", "text": "Appendix Tables   Table A.1   Table A.2   Table A.3   Table A.4 Primary indicators of disability in NELS:88 (variable name and items) . .

As a result, education practitioners, researchers, and policymakers at all levels have been keenly interested in better understanding the characteristics, educational experiences, and outcomes of students with disabilities. These practitioners have also been interested in better assessing the degree to which the spirit and mandates of the IDEA are being carried out by state and local education agencies to meet the needs of this specially challenged population of youth. Of particular interest is the quality of the educational experiences of these students in the context of their transition from school to work or to postsecondary education. A decade ago, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) of the U.S. Department of Education published a report entitled Characteristics of High School Students Who Identify Themselves as Handicapped (Owings and Stocking 1985), based on data from the High School and Beyond (HS&B) surveys of high school sophomores and seniors in 1980 and 1982. This report provided the basis for examining the status and experiences of secondary students with disabilities at the national level and for meeting the information needs described above. With the development of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), the means are available to update and expand upon this earlier report with nationally representative, longitudinal data on students in grades 8 through 12."}, {"section_title": "The National Education. Longitudinal Study of 1988", "text": "In accordance with its congressional mandate to collect and disseminate statistics and statistical analyses, and in response to the need for policy-relevant, longitudinal data on nationally representative samples of elementary and secondary students, NCES initiated a continuing, long-term program called the National Education Longitudinal Studies (NELS). The goal of this program is \"to study the educational, vocational, and personal development of Introduction students at various grade levels, and the personal, familial, social, institutional, and cultural factors that may affect that development\" (NCES 1994). NELS:88 represents the third major study in the NELS program, and follows the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS-72) and the High School and Beyond (HS&B) study of 1980. NELS:88 began with a base-year survey of eighth-grade students in 1988, followed up at 2-year intervals in 1990intervals in , 1992intervals in , and 1994 collected data from more than 20,000 students, as well as their parents, teachers, school principals, and high school transcripts. The study entails a complex sampling design, which includes such features as augmentation (through \"freshening\") to provide a representative sample of students at each phase of the survey (i.e., to represent the tenth-grade population in 1990 and the twelfth-grade population in 1992); the follow-up and subsequent inclusion of students who were not eligible to participate during the base year (base-year-ineligible, or BYI students) or who dropped out of school; and a complex set of case weights that support longitudinal analyses and combinations of data from student, parent, and teacher surveys. The target population for the NELS:88 base-year survey consisted of all public and private schools containing eighth grades in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Excluded from the NELS:88 sample were Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) schools, special education schools for the disabled, area vocational schools that did not enroll students directly, and schools for dependents of U.S. personnel overseas. Within eligible schools, ungraded classrooms were not included in the NELS:88 sample. The population of sampled eighth-grade students excluded students with severe mental disabilities, students whose command of the English language was not sufficient for understanding the survey materials (especially the cognitive tests), and students with physical or emotional problems that would have made it unduly difficult for them to have participated in the survey. Eligibility decisions for students were made on an individual basis by school staff; school coordinators were told that when there was doubt, they should consider the student capable of participating in the survey. By these procedures, a total of 5.35 percent of the potential student sample was excluded for reasons of mental disability (3.04 percent), limited English proficiency (1.90 percent), and physical or emotional problem (0.41 percent). Students thus excluded from base-year participation were followed and many were included in subsequent follow-up surveys. As a result of the exclusions discussed above, as many as one-half of the children with disabilities who are served under the IDEA were likely excluded from the NELS:88 base-year sample. For this reason, the NELS:88 data should not be considered representative of children with disabilities as identified under the IDEA. At the same time, the NELS:88 data set does allow for comprehensive examination of students perceived by parents, teachers, school officials, and by students themselves as having disabilities and the roles that school and home environments play in promoting their growth and achievement of positive (or negative) outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Purposes of This Report:,", "text": "The primary purposes of this report are (1) to identify those students in NELS:88 who had or may have had a disabling Condition or received services related to such a condition and (2) to examine their personal and family characteristics and their educational experiences and outcomes as they progress from the eighth grade in 1988 into and out of high school in 1992. Several data sources available in NELS:88 are used to identify and describe these students in this report. In particular, parent surveys in the base year (1988), teacher surveys in the first follow-up (1990), student surveys in the first and second (1992) follow-ups, and information related to special education participation collected from high school officials for inclusion in the high school transcript file are used to identify students with disabilities. In addition, select data from the base-year and first and second follow-up surveys are used to describe the populations of students identified as disabled by these various sources. A third purpose of this report is to examine the alternative definitions of disability that are available from these diverse data sources in NELS:88 and to assess the extent to which these various definitions influence descriptions of the characteristics, educational experiences, and outcomes of students with disabilities. This report is one of a series of NCES reports analyzing NELS:88 data in order to address key policy issues and fundamental questions related to the development of our nation's youth and their educational infrastructure.

In the discussion of a particular topic (e.g., demographic characteristics), comparisons are made between populations of students with and without disabilities as a whole, focusing on two primary sources of information regarding disability statusparents and teachers of the students surveyed in NELS:88. These sources permit further comparisons to be made between students identified as having specific types of disabilities (e.g., learning disability, physical disability, sensory disability) and those students not identified as disabled. Supplementing the data based on parent and teacher reports are selected comparisons based on student self-definitions of disability status. Each chapter is described briefly below. Introduction in federal programs and data collection activities; reviews .thendicators in NELS:88 related to disability status and disability-related services received, providing rationales for use of a selected set of these indicators in subsequent analyses; and describes the extent of overlap among these NELS:88 indicators. Chapter 3. Personal and Family Characteristics of Students with Disabilities answers the following questions in terms of the NELS:88 data set: How can students with disabilities be described in terms of key demographic characteristics, family background and socioeconomic level, and self-concept; and do these descriptions vary across data sources? More specifically, chapter 3 examines ascribed characteristics such as age, sex, and minority status; contextual characteristics including socioeconomic status, family status (i.e., single-parent household), and parent education; and personal psychological characteristics including self-concept and locus of control. Chapter 4. Educational Experiences of Students with Disabilities primarily addresses this question:. What types of curricular, extracurricular, and special programs (including special education) comprise the educational experiences of students with and without disabilities? Specifically, this chapter describes the educational and school-based experiences of these students in terms of significant course-taking patterns (e.g., course enrollment and units taken), grade-level retention, and participation in special or alternative high school programs and extracurricular activities. Where analyses involve data from student transcripts, the eighth-grade to twelfthgrade transcript panel weight (F2TRP1WT) rather than the eighth-grade to twelfth-grade panel weight (F2PNLWT) is used. Exploratory analyses of the participation in special programs of students who were initially excused from NELS:88 because of mental disability (the Base-Year Ineligible, or BYI, sample) and subsequently returned to the sample in the first and second follow-up surveys are unweighted; weights were never developed for students who were not actually sampled. Chapter 5. Educational Outcomes of Students with Disabilities focuses on these important questions: What is the academic performance of students with disabilities? To what extent do these students disengage from education entirely? What are their expectations with respect to high school graduation and continued education? In addressing these questions, chapter 5 focuses on the educational outcomes of students identified in NELS:88 as disabled, including educational achievement, expectations, and disengagement (i.e., dropout status). Chapter 6. Conclusion and Implications summarizes the key findings of this report related to the characteristics, experiences, and outcomes of students identified in NELS:88 as disabled. It also summarizes findings related to definitions of this population based on NELS:88, and it provides suggestions to help researchers and practitioners who are involved in studying students with disabilities to make effective use of the NELS:88 data set. Introduction of potential bias and underrepresentation? This appendix supplements the discussion of chapter by providing a list of the actual indicators in NELS:88 related to disability status and disability-related services received. It then compares estimates based on NELS:88 and other sources of the prevalence of students with disabilities in the general population and estimates of the distribution of disabled students among various special education service categories. Appendix B. NELS:88 Disability Estimates Based on Alternative Disability Definitions addresses primarily these questions: How consistent are student, parent, teacher, and transcript reports of disability statuswith each other and over time? What are the implications of different reports of disability status for the analyses presented in this report? This appendix supplements chapter 2 as it describes the unweighted sample sizes and the weighted population percentages for the student populations that can be defined from various NELS:88 data sources (i.e., parents, teachers, students, and school officials). Appendix C. Standard Errors provides the standard errors to accompany each of the data tables presented in the report. Note that these standard errors apply to the point estimates included in the tables; they may not be used to assess statistical significance of particular comparisons, as special standard error estimates were developed in these cases to adjust for nonindependence of the groups being compared. Appendix D. Technical Notes provides a description of NELS:88 and of the statistical procedures used for this report."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 2 Identifying Students with Disabilities", "text": "One of the challenges of characterizing students as having disabilities, particularly when using extant data sources, is defining the population of interest. Since a standardized definition of disability status does not currently exist, various working definitions of disability status have been used to establish eligibility for special education programs, to guide research activities, and to describe specific populations (e.g., in terms of their characteristics and outcomes)."}, {"section_title": "Federal Classification", "text": "Currently, under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), the following disability categories are used for eligibility and reporting: 1. specific learning disability 2. speech or language impairment 3. mental retardation 4. serious emotional disturbance 5. multiple disabilities 6. hearing impairment) 7. deafness3 8. orthopedic impairment 9. other health impairment 10. visual impairment or blindness 11. autism4 12. traumatic brain injury' 13. deaf-blindness Despite the apparently distinct nature of these federal categories, in practice state and local education agencies may apply these definitions differently in determining eligibility for special education services. In fact, the National Center for Educational Outcomes (NCEO) found considerable variation in the use of these categories across 19 national data collection programs that it studied (see OSEP 1994, table 5.8, as cited in Ingels 1995. These differences result in substantial variations among states in the percentages of students identified as eligible for special education services and in the proportions of students identified within the different disability categories. For example, the 16th Annual Report to Congress on the Implementation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (OSEP 1994) reported, for the 1991-92 school year, overall percentages of students with disabilities ranging from a low of 5.2 percent in Hawaii to a high of 11.5 percent in Massachusetts; and percentages of students with specific learning disabilities ranging from a low of 2.2 percent in Florida to a high of 7.0 percent in Massachusetts.5 Although some amount of these regional variations may reflect actual differences in the relative sizes of disabled populations, much of the variation may be attributed to \"differences in either formal or practical definitional criteria, or both\" for identifying students with disabilities (Owings and Stocking 1985). Under the IDEA, for example, the term \"children with disabilities\" refers to children who have been evaluated and found to have a disabling condition that causes them to need special education services; however, many children with impairments do not require special education services, although they may receive remedial education services, accommodations, or other specialized services or instruction. In addition, the variation in the estimated sizes of disabled populations is true particularly for those disability categories that involve greater subjective judgments for classification, such as specific learning disabilities and serious emotional disturbance. (In fact, a controversial plan to change the definition of \"serious emotional disturbance\" has been under debate for several yearse.g., The Special Educator, March 4, 1995.) In part because of these definitional ambiguities, the very concept of categorizing disabilities has increasingly become a subject of debate. The U.S. Department of Education, for example, has recommended that the collection of state-reported data on children by disability categories be eliminated. This recommendation also includes a provision stating that the law does not require children to be classified by their impairment. Despite the fact that existing definitions of disability may be applied in various ways, there is an extensive research base on the issues surrounding disability classification for educational purposes. Furthermore, all of the policies mentioned above do share a common construct of disabilityi.e., that students must demonstrate a functional disability in one or more major life functions."}, {"section_title": "International Classification", "text": "The definition of disability status is a challenge that goes beyond U.S. boundaries. For example, the World Health Organization has taken steps to develop the International Classification of. Impairments, Disabilities, and Handicaps (ICIDH) in order to define and record the incidence of disabilities worldwide in a standardized fashion. The ICIDH represents an ambitious undertaking to distinguish among impairments (i.e., chronic health conditions), disabilities (i.e., limitations in performing specific activities), and handicaps (i.e., disadvantages resulting from these conditions or limitations). Although currently the United States is far from formally adopting this system as a guide to monitoring and reporting on disability status, the impetus provided by the ICIDH to reconsider disability classifications has led to U.S. efforts to clarify the ICIDH system (e.g., Frey et al. 1994).

Consider the differences in approach of three of the most prominent studies undertaken since 1980: the National Longitudinal Transition Study of Special Education Students (NLTS), High School and Beyond (HS&B), and the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88). In addition to the discussion below, appendix A contains more details on these national studies."}, {"section_title": "National Longitudinal Transition Study", "text": "The NLTS was a federally mandated, 5-year study that began in 1987. It was the first national study designed specifically to describe the characteristics and transition experiences of secondary school students with disabilities over time. The NLTS included a nationally representative sample of 8,000 secondary special education students, ages 13-21. The student sample was selected from rosters of special education students, classified by federal disability category, which were provided by school districts. Broad in scope, the NLTS gathered baseline and follow-up data on these students in 1987 and 1990 on a wide range of variables including individual and family characteristics, parental expectations, school programs and services, school achievement and completion, and characteristics of employment and postsecondary educational experiences. The study has yielded numerous papers and publications focusing on the secondary and postsecondary experiences of youth with disabilities in general and of specific subpopulations such as youth with serious emotional disturbances and learning disabilities (Wagner et al., 1993)."}, {"section_title": "High School and Beyond", "text": "HS&B relied on student self-reports as the primary indicators of disability status, using eight specific disability categories.6 Secondary indicators were provided by teacher reports that students had or may have had a \"physical or emotional handicap that affected [their] schoolwork.\" In a 1985 NCES report entitled Characteristics of High School Students Who Identify Themselves as Handicapped, Owings and Stocking used HS&B data to examine the stability over time of student reports of disability status. They also associated disability status at points in time with indicators of psychological status and school performance to determine the individual-level correlates of perceived disability status. In the course of this work, the 6 The 1982 HS&B student.survey used the following response categories to determine disability status: visual handicap (not correctable by glasses), hard of hearing, deafness, speech disability, orthopedic handicap, other physical disability or handicap, specific learning disability, and none'of these conditions. In the first 1980 HS&B survey, because of ambiguous wording, only five categories could be used to identify disability status: hard of hearing, deafness, speech disability, orthopedic handicap, and specific learning disability. Profiles of Students with Disabilities as Identified in NELS:88 9 self-versus other-definition of disability status emerged as.a topic worthy of further study, along with interest in comparing the experiences of students classified as disabled by selfreport and by teacher appraisal."}, {"section_title": "National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988", "text": "NELS:88 did not ask students directly about their disability status. Rather, parents in the base-year NELS:88 survey were the primary source of information related to specific disability status and special services received by eighth-grade students (using 10 disability status and 10 disability service categories, similar though not identical to the federal eligibility categories)! On a more limited basis and using different indicators, two teachers for each student also provided their perceptions of whether students may have had disabilities that were affecting their schoolwork. At base year and first follow-up, teachers were asked to indicate whether students had ever fallen behind in school work because of a health problem, and whether students currently had a physical or emotional handicap that was affecting their school work. At first follow-up only, teachers were asked whether students currently had a learning disability that was affecting their school work.' Although not asked to report directly on disability status, students at the first and second follow-ups were asked to report whether they had ever been in a \"special program for the educationally or physically handicapped\" in high school. In addition, students at the second follow-up were asked whether they were currently in a special education program. School staff at the second follow-up also were asked to provide information on whether a student had been enrolled in a special education program at some time during high school.' Defining Disability Status Using NELS:88 NELS:88 provides four different sources of information related to the disability status of students surveyed: parents, teachers, students, and school officials responsible for providing student transcripts. A variety of survey items and indicators drawn from these sources may be used alone or in combination to define disability status for further analyses. This wealth of 7 The NELS:88 parent survey used the following response categories to determine disability status: visual handicap (not correctable by glasses), hearing problem, deafness, speech problem, orthopedic problem, other physical disability, specific learning problem, emotional problem, mental retardation, and other health problem. The survey did not provide a definition for the last category, \"other health problem\"; see Appendix A for the exact wording of this item. The parent survey used the same categories to probe for receipt of disability-related services. 8 Teachers were not asked at the second follow-up in NELS:88 whether students may have had disabilities or health problems that were affecting their schoolwork. 9 The variable F2RSPFLG is included in the NELS:88 database to indicate whether the student had participated in a special education program during high school. During the second follow-up (Fall 1992), personnel in approximately 1,500 sampled schools assembled transcripts for students in the NELS:88 sample, following specifications provided by NCES. A \"Student Program Identification Sheet\" was used to identify students who had been enrolled in a special education program (or a bilingual or gifted program) during high school. Identifying Students with Disabilities data makes it possible to compare estimates derived from different disability definitions and to select definitions for use that meet a range of conceptual and sample-size requirements."}, {"section_title": "Students Identified by Parents as Disabled", "text": "Parents in the base-year survey were the only respondents in NELS:88 to be asked whether students had a specific disability-related problem and whether they had ever received special services for that problem. Parents could indicate that their child had any one or more of the following 10 disability-related problems and/or services received: visual handicap (not correctable by glasses), hearing problem, deafness, speech problem, orthopedic problem, other physical disability, specific learning problem, emotional problem, mental retardation, or other health problem. In addition, during the base year, parents were asked whether students currently were receiving services for problems related to a learning disability or an orthopedic problem. Although parents may not be trained professionals in diagnosing disability conditions, their perceptions of their children matter a great deal (i.e., these perceptions may affect their expectations for their children and can shape students' attitudes about themselves). For this reason, these parent-derived indicators of disability status are important to consider. More specifically, these indicators can be used to define populations of disabled students in four ways: 1. having one or more disability-related problems 2. having ever received one or more disability-related services 3. having one or more disability-related problems OR having ever received one or more disability-related services 4. having one or more disability-related problems AND having ever received one or more disability-related services As has been argued in the literature (e.g., Hodapp and Krasner 1994), the fourth definition may well lessen the inadvertent errors that parents might have made in identifying their children as disabled. In addition, this definition provides some implied indication of agreement on disability status by parents and schools, in that parents indicate disability-related problem(s) and related services received, and such services would be provided only if school staff identify the legitimate need for such service(s). For these reasons, this definition of disability status likely provides a more reliable basis from which to explore population differences and is the one based on parents' responses that we use for purposes of analysis in this report."}, {"section_title": "Students Identified by Teachers as Disabled", "text": "In the base-year and the first follow-up NELS:88 surveys, each of two teachers was asked to identify (1) students who had ever fallen behind in school work because of health problems, and (2) students who had physical or emotional handicaps that were affecting their school work. It is important to keep in mind that this method of identification of disability status directly links a student's disability status with his/her classroom performancea method of identification that differs from the other NELS:88 sources considered in this report and that likely affects the numbers of students that teachers perceived to be disabled. During the first follow-up only, these two teachers were also asked to identify students who had a learning disability that affected their school work.. an the second follow-up, teachers were not asked any questions related to students' disability or health status.) The teacherrespondents at each of these time-points were not special' educators; rather, they were instructional staff selected from the following four subject areas: mathematics, English, science, and social studies. For this study, teacher responses at the first follow-up were of greatest interest because they included the identification of learning disabled students. Because learning disabilities, for example, may manifest themselves in the contexts of specific subject-matter areas, a student was considered as learning disabled if either teacher described him or her in this way. This approach was also followed for health problems and physical or emotional handicaps; that is, these disabilities were attributed to students if either teacher reported them."}, {"section_title": "Student Self-identification of Disability Status", "text": "Although parents and, to a somewhat lesser degree, teachers are the primary identifiers of student disability status in specific disability categories in NELS:88, the data set does include several disability-related indicators based on student self-reports. Specifically, NELS:88 asked students to report (1) at the first and second follow-ups whether they had ever been in a \"special program for the educationally or physically handicapped\" in high school (separate indicators for educational and physical handicap), and (2) at the second follow-up whether they were currently enrolled in a special education program. Although these indicators do not provide any sense of the types of disabilities that might have served as the basis for students' responses, they may be used to describe the characteristics of students who perceived themselves (or who may have perceived that others considered them) as disabled in some way. Since the wording of the student indicators in the first and second follow-ups was identical, it might be expected that responses at the second follow-up would \"include\" the responses made earlier (i.e., that students surveyed in both follow-ups who responded positively to either item in 1990 would also have responded positively to the identical item in 1992, as both refer to having ever been placed in a special program). The data in this case, however, suggest that the two measures are more independent than would be expected. For example, in the case of either reported placement, over one-half of the students who responded to both surveys and reported at first follow-up that they had ever been in a special program no longer reported any such placement by their senior years. This inconsistency may be the result of students' not remembering their earlier high school experiences, or it may be additional evidence of the transitory nature of selected disability self-identifications (see, for example, Owings and Stocking 1985). In any case, the responses from students to these items at either follow-up appear to provide independent evidence of disability status. Separate examination of student-defined disabled populations based on NELS:88 first and second follow-up data collections permits interesting comparisons with the data on students' disability status from other sources. For example, the disability population defined by students' first follow-up responses can be compared to the populations defined by ,the responses of first follow-up teachers. In a similar vein, the population defined by students' second follow-up responses can be compared to the indicator of special education program participation provided by the NELS:88 transcript file, which was based on school officials' judgment (see below). By Identifying Students with Disabilities combining student samples at each point in time (i.e., sophomores at first follow-up and seniors at second follow -up)' who reported participating in programs for either the physically or educationally handicapped in high school, we can compare (1) the population estimates derived from these indicators to those based on the first follow-up teacher and second followup transcript file indicators, (2) the extent to which these definitions overlap for particular students, and (3) the school-related experiences and outcomes of \"self-defined\" versus \"otherdefined\" special education students. This latter type of comparison is of particular interest because HS&B used student self-defined measures of disability status, and the differential characteristics of self-defined versus other-defined disabled populations were examined (e.g., Owings and Stocking 1985). In the following chapters, we limit our focus in this report to the student-defined disabled population identified at the NELS:88 first follow-up, since it is the definition most proximate in time to those provided by parents and teachers."}, {"section_title": "Students Identified by School Officials as Disabled", "text": "At the time of the NELS:88 second follow-up in 1992, transcripts were requested from all participating students in a sample of 1,500 public and private high schools. At the time transcripts were collected from each school, school officials were asked to complete a checklist for each participating student and to indicate, among other things, whether the student had ever participated in special education programs during high school. The estimates of students participating in special education based on these checklist responses are drawn from two categories: students judged to have participated in special education, and students judged to have participated in both special education and bilingual education. At the same time of the second follow-up, 555 students were reported as having been special education participants in high school, and 8 additional students were reported as having been identified as both special education and bilingual education participants (i.e., a total, when these categories are combined and the transcript weight (F2TRSCWT) is applied, of approximately 4 percent of enrolled high school seniors in 1992). As suggested earlier for future exploratory studies, the population of disabled students identified by school officials may be compared to the population of students at the second follow-up who reported they had ever participated in programs for the educationally or physically handicapped while in high school. This indicator provided by school officials of high school participation in special education programs also provides a measure of the special education services received by students defined as disabled from other data sources (i.e., parents at the base year, and teachers or students at the first follow-up)."}, {"section_title": "Overlap Among Various NELS:88 Definitions of Disability Status", "text": "Tables 2.1 and 2.2 provide information on (1) the different sources and definitions of disability status in NELS:88, and (2) the overlap among the populations identified as disabled by the various NELS:88 sources. both the similarities of particular disability types and the need for comparability with the other disability indicators available from NELS:88. Also note that a \"multiple problems\" category has been added to both the parent and teacher definitions so that students identified as having more than one disabling condition can be examined separately, in addition to being included in those disability categories for which they were (also) identifiedi.e., a student identified as having two disabling conditions would be counted in two separate disability categories, as well as in the \"multiple problems\" category. When these definitions are examined, it is important to keep in mind the differences in the sources of the definitions (i.e., parent, teacher, and school official), the item-wordings that were used to elicit responses from these sources, and the timing of the survey administrations. Differences in perceptions of disability status, for example, and perceived and actual changes in disability status over time can be expected to occur and have been documented (e.g., Owings and Stocking 1985). In short, these different methods of identifying disabled students might be expected to produce rather distinctive student groups, and table 2.2 confirms this by cross-referencing the populations defined in table 2.1. Table 2.2 strongly suggests that this report examines separate and distinct populations of students and that comparisons among these populations should be made with care. For example, about one-half of the 1,602 students identified by parents in the base year as disabled were similarly identified by teachers at the time of the first follow-up. Of those students identified as disabled by teachers at first follow-up, only 6.3 percent identified themselves at the first follow-up as having been served in special programs for the educationally or physically handicapped. In addition, about one-fifth of the 188 BYI students with mental disabilities (see appendix A) who participated in the first or second follow-up reported having been served in special education programs in high school, while just over half of these students were reported by school officials to have been served. In this chapter, we have set the stage for the remainder of this report, which will describe the characteristics, educational experiences, and outcomes of students who participated in NELS:88 and were identified as disabled. We have reviewed the differences in the ways various national data sets identify and classify students with disabilities, and we have suggested various indicators from NELS:88 that can be used to describe the experiences of disabled populations. The presentations in appendices A and B supplement the discussion of this chapter by providing additional detail about the NELS:88 indicators related to disability. Specifically, appendix A lists the actual items included on the various NELS:88 surveys that might be used to define disability status or services received and compares disability prevalence estimates based on NELS:88 to those estimated from other selected national surveys and federal disability categories. Appendix B compares estimates based on alternative disability definitions that may be developed for various NELS:88 data sources (i.e., parents, teachers, and students). \"Cross-sectional\" refers to the nationally representative sample of students taken at each NELS survey point (i.e., base year, first follow-up, and second follow-up); \"Longitudinal\" refers to the sample of the same cohort of students followed through each survey wave. (b) A \"multiple problems\" category has been added to both the parent and teacher definitions so that students identified as having more than one disabling condition can be examined separately, in addition to being included in those disability categories for which they were (also) identified. (c) This group includes only those BYI students who were excluded from NELS:88 in the base year for reasons of mental disability. As explained in appendix A, other students were BYI for reasons of physical disability, limited-English proficiency, and unknown factors.

Specifically, this chapter compares the background characteristics of these students with the characteristics of students not identified as having a disability, and focuses on two primary sources of information regarding disability statusparents and teachers of the students surveyed in NELS:88. In addition, comparisons are made among students identified as having specific types of disabilities (e.g., learning disability, physical disability, sensory disability) and between parent and teacher reports and student self-definitions of disability status. These comparisons are similar to ones presented in a report on the characteristics of high school students with self-reported disabilities, based on HS&B (Owings and Stockings 1985). In combination, these NELS:88 and HS&B data highlight the differences found between disabled and nondisabled student populations and suggest how different sources of information on disability status may influence findings. As indicated in chapter 2, the questions posed to parents about their children's disability status at the base year (1988) permit students to be identified according to several specific disability categories, in addition to being identified as having or not having a disability-related problem. These parent estimates of disability status, shown in table 2.1, allow the following comparisons to be made: (1) comparisons between students identified as disabled versus students not identified as disabled; (2) comparisons between students in four specific categories of disabilitylearning disabled (LD), health problems (HP), physical and emotional (PE) problems, and a category for more than one problem or multiple problemsversus students not identified as disabled; and (3) comparisons among students in three specific categories of disability that comprise the more general PE category: physical (P), emotional (E), and sensory-impaired (SE) versus other categories of disabled and nondisabled students. The questions in NELS:88 posed to teachers regarding their perceptions of students' disability status provide the same categorization as those provided by parents except that the teacher questions do not allow the physical and emotional (PE) category to be described in terms of three discrete categories. It is important to note that parent and teacher identifications of disability status are not strictly comparable, as described in chapter 2, because (1) parents' responses are from the base-year survey and teachers' responses are from the first follow-up; and (2) parents and teachers responded to different questions in their respective NELS:88 Profiles of Students with Disabilities as Identified in NELS:88 17 Background Characteristics of Students with Disabilities surveys (e.g., teacher perceptions of students' disability status was linked to their classroom performance, whereas parental identification was linked to whether or not a student received disability-related services). Analyses in this chapter include only those students who were present in all three NELS:88 surveys (i.e., base year, first follow-up, and second follow-up), weighted to represent students and dropouts who \"survived\" and participated in the first and second follow-up surveys. Thus, the analyses in this chapter (and chapters 4 and 5) represent a cohort analysis of 8th-graders from 1988 to 1992. The cohort analysis assures us that the differences observed between disabled students as identified by parents versus those identified by teachers are not due to sampling fluctuations across the three surveys.' All comparisons that are made in this and in following chapters utilize SUDAAN procedures.\" Where comparisons might involve \"overlapping\" cases (e.g., when disabled students identified by parents are compared to those identified by teachers), those cases (i.e., the students identified by both sources as disabled) were removed prior to computation of the statistical tests. See Appendix D for a description of the procedures used in computation of statistical tests for this report. It is important to note that the standard errors presented in Appendix C are those that correspond to the percentage estimates shown in the report tables (i.e. , they include the overlapping cases); they are not the standard errors that were used in the computation of statistical tests when overlapping cases were removed."}, {"section_title": "Demographic and Family Characteristics of Students", "text": "Tables 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 show the distributions of students identified as disabled, and those not identified, across several key demographic and family characteristics."}, {"section_title": "Sex", "text": "Consistent with previous reports on the sex distribution of students with disabilities (e.g., HS&B, NLTS), male students were typically overrepresented in the population of students with disabilities compared to their proportion in the nondisabled group (table 3.1). For example, 57.8 percent of students identified as disabled by parents were maleby teachers, 54.3 percent,' almost the same. Overall, male students represented about one-half (49 percent) of the nondisabled population. Generally, teachers and parents were more likely to identify male students than female students as having disabilities, except in the category of Background Characteristics of Students with Disabilities health problems, where teachers reported that only 36.7 percent of students with health problems were male, while parents reported 52.1 percent. Table 3.1-Percentage of students with disabilities, as identified by parents and teachers, who were male, were members of an ethnic/racial minority group, and average age (NELS:88 Second Followup Student Survey)a "}, {"section_title": "Source of Disability Information", "text": "\n\n"}, {"section_title": "Minority Status13", "text": "Similar percentages of parent-identified disabled students and students in the nondisabled population were members of minority groups (23.7 and 26.9 percent, respectively) (table 3.1). Similarly, the minority representation for students identified as disabled by teachers was about the same as their proportion in the nondisabled population (27.5 and 25.0 percent, respectively). This finding holds when looking at differences across white, black, and other 13 For purposes of analyses of NELS:88 data, minority status is defined to include those students who did not report being \"White, not of Hispanic origin\" (i.e., students who reported they were Asian or Pacific Islander; Hispanic, regardless of race; black, not of Hispanic origin; or American Indian or Alaskan Native). We also examine results in which we separate black, not of Hispanic origin, from other minorities. Although it has been suggested (e.g., Ingels et al., 1994) that undercoverage bias due to base-year exclusion of students with severe disabilities may affect certain estimates for racial subgroups, it has also been noted that, by the first follow-up survey, coverage of these populations was improved when just about one-half of the excluded disabled students with mental or physical disabilities were returned to the sample.  (table 3.2); there appears to be no difference in the identification of students with disabilities and no overrepresentation of minorities in the disabled category generally. The observed proportionate representation of minorities overall in the disabled population in NELS:88 is interesting and would appear to be at odds with current views that minorities are often overrepresented in special education categories (e.g., Special Education Report 1995). However, NELS:88 data do show an overrepresentation of minorities in the learning disabled (LD) category, as defined by the perceptions of teachers. The minority representation among LD students when identified by teachers was 30.5 percent, compared to 18.3 percent when identified by parents. The former result suggests an overrepresentation of minorities in the LD category when identified by teachers and compared to the percentage of minorities among the teacher-defined nondisabled population, while the latter result suggests an underrepresentation of minorities in this category when identified by parent responses and compared to the percentage of minorities among the parent-defined nondisabled population. Further analyses suggest that these findings for minorities in the LD category were the result of differential identification rates for black students in particular (table 3.2). Additional analyses show that the percentages of students with learning disabilities as identified by parents, for either black students (7.9 percent) or other minority students (10.4 percent), were lower than the percentages of students in the nondisabled category who are black (12.5 percent) or other minority (14.4 percent). In contrast, black students were overrepresented among these students identified as LD by teachers. The percentage of students with teacher-identified learning disabilities who are black was 16.6, compared to 11.3 percent of students in the teacher-identified nondisabled group; 13.9 percent of students identified as LD by teachers were members of other minority groups, compared to 13.8 percent in the nondisabled category. These findings suggest differential perceptions between teachers and parents with regard to disability status and indicate a potential problem for studying students with learning disabilities; namely, the distribution of outcomes may depend on which source of information (parents or teachers) is used to define students with learning disabilities."}, {"section_title": "Age", "text": "Age patterns showed little variation among students perceived to be disabled by either parents or teachers (table 3.1). These disabled populations appeared to be slightly older in eighth grade than their nondisabled peers (about 0.3 years difference for both parents and teachers). For both cases, students identified as LD were the oldest (14.8 and 14.7 years as identified by parents and teachers, respectively). This finding may reflect the higher retention rates of these students in earlier grades, a topic that is discussed in chapter 4. Background Characteristics of Students with Disabilities Table 3.2-Percentage of students with disabilities, as identified by parents and teachers, who were of various races (NELS:88 Second Follow-up Student Survey)a   Table 3.3 shows the distribution of students identified by parents and teachers as disabled among levels of parents' socioeconomic status (SES) and highest education obtained. The data in this table suggest that SES may play a role in the identification of disability status as reported by teachers but not as reported by parents."}, {"section_title": "Parent Socioeconomic Status and Education Level", "text": "Among students identified as disabled by either parents or teachers, the percentages of students from families in the lowest SES quartile were 27.9 and 27.7 percent, respectively!' The distributions of disabled and nondisabled students across SES and education categories were rather similar when looking at the parent-identified students. For the population of students identified as disabled by teachers, the differences in SES and parent education between the disabled and nondisabled groups were more pronounced. Most striking in this teacher-identified population is SES: fewer disabled students than nondisabled students were from families in the upper SES quartiles, and greater numbers of the disabled students were in the lower SES categories, compared to the nondisabled students. Similarly, fewer of these teacher-identified disabled students than nondisabled students had parents with higher levels of education. pacigrt ound Characteristics of Students with Disabilities Within specific disability categories as defined by parents, however, there were some notable differences in the SES distributions of disabled and nondisabled students. For example, the physical disability and sensory impairment categories each included more students in the lowest SES group than did the nondisabled student category (38.5 percent and 31.7 percent, respectively, versus 23.0 percent). These two disability categories also had fewer students in the highest SES group than did the nondisabled category. For students identified by their teachers as having health problems, there were almost no differences in the distributions of disabled and nondisabled students for either SES or for parents' education. The percentages of disabled students and nondisabled students who live in households headed by single females was about the same when identifications were derived from parent reports (17.0 versus 14.5 percent) (table 3.4). _When disability status is based on teacher perceptions, however, students with disabilities generally were more often found in single female-headed households (16.6 versus 12.4 percent). This was true particularly for students identified by teachers as having physical and/or emotional problems. "}, {"section_title": "Psychological Profiles of Students", "text": "Given the special challenges many students with disabilities face at school, it is interesting to assess their psychological well-being and to compare it to that of their nondisabled counterparts. Measures such as self-concept and locus of control may reveal attitudes that importantly affect performance, including creative risk-taking on classroom assignments and confidence in tackling new subject areas (Strube and Roemmele 1985). One might expect that the psychological health of students with disabilities is lower than that of nondisabled students, as a result of both perceiving themselves to be different from other students and feeling themselves to be regarded as less able by others, teachers and parents as well as students. Background Characteristics of Students with Disabilities NELS:88 asked students to respond to a series of questions intended to measure their psychological statespecifically, questions related to their self-concept and locus of control.' Students responded to this series of questions at three successive points in time: as 8th-graders during the NELS:88 base-year survey, as sophomores during the first follow-up, and as seniors during the second follow-up. Tables 3.5 and 3.6 provide measures at these three points in time for locus of control and selfconcept, respectively. Both measures reflect students' scaled responses to the items related to each of the two psychological variables, which were designed to be comparable with similar scales used in HS&B. In NELS:88, the locus of control scale was an average of six items (e.g., \"Chance and luck are very important for what happens in my life\"), which were standardized separately to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1; all nonmissing components were averaged. A higher positive score on this scale indicates a higher level of internal control (i.e., the sense of having some control of one's life). Those students identified as disabled by either their parents or teachers evidenced lower levels of internal control than students not so identified, and this difference was reasonably stable from 1988 to 1992 (table 3.5). Interestingly, students identified by parents as having either health problems or physical disabilities did not differ from nondisabled students in their responses to the locus of control items. The NELS:88 self-concept scale was an average of a different set of seven items (e.g., \"I feel good about myself'), which were also standardized to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. As with locus of control, higher scores on this scale represent higher levels of selfconcept. The pattern of self-concept scores among students identified as disabled by teachers was similar to that found for locus of control (table 3.6). Students perceived to be disabled by their teachers evidenced consistently lower levels of self-concept than did nondisabled students. Lower self-concept scores were also found for teacher-identified disabled students (when compared to students not so identified) in each of the specific disability categories over time. For students identified as disabled by parents, the pattern of these scores was less consistent across specific disability categories and across time. Only in the LD category, for example, was there a consistent pattern of difference over time between disabled and nondisabled students. Background Characteristics of Students with Disabilities Table 3.5-Mean locus of control scores, over time, of students with disabilities First, Table 3.6-Mean self-concept scores, over time, of students with disabilities (NELS:88 Base-Year, First, and Second Follow-up Student Surveys), as identified by parents and teachersa The results from analyses of locus of control and self-concept measures for students identified as disabled by teachers were consistent with reports from the HS&B data, which showed that students who identified themselves as \"handicapped\" had lower locus of control and selfesteem scores than students who did not identify themselves in this way (Owings and Stocking 1985). In contrast, for students identified as disabled by parents, consistently lower scores were found only for locus of control. Interestingly, results presented later in this chapter (see table 3.9) for students who identified themselves as disabled in NELS:88 correspond to the results based on parent perceptions; although differences between disabled and nondisabled students exist for locus of control, differences in self-concept scores are not apparent. Table 3.7 shows the distribution of students with and without disabilities across two general measures of school environmenturbanicity and SES (as expressed by the percentage of students receiving free or reduced-price lunches at school). As shown, few differences were found between disabled and nondisabled students in terms of the school's geographic context or SES. According to both parent and teacher perceptions, students with and without disabilities were similarly distributed in rural, urban, and suburban locations, and the proportion of students receiving free or reduced-price lunches was about the same: just under one-quarter for both groups. The similarity between the nondisabled and disabled populations persists within the specific disability categories, except for students identified by parents as having emotional or physical disabilities. Students whose parents said they have emotional problems and have ever received services for these problems were less likely to be found in rural schools (20.9 percent) and were slightly more likely to be found in urban (29.1 percent) and suburban (50.0 percent) schools than their nondisabled counterparts.

Tables 3.8 and 3.9 examine some of these same characteristics-specifically, sex, race, SES, locus of control, and self-concept-for those students who identified themselves as disabled. The distributions of these students in terms of sex and minority status were similar to the distributions shown in table 3.1 for either parent-or teacher-identified students (table 3.8). Regardless of which of these respondents identified a student as disabled, disproportionately more were male. Of the students who identified themselves as disabled, 60.8 percent were male, compared to 49.7 percent of the nonidentified group. In addition, this self-identified population had about the same percentage of minority students as the nondisabled population (25.9 versus 27.2 percent). Finally, in terms of socioeconomic status, self-identified students were distributed similarly across SES quartiles to nondisabled students.  Table 3.9 displays the self-concept and locus of control scores of students who identified themselves as disabled. As discussed earlier, these results are generally consistent with the patterns observed for disabled students identified by parents, but not by teachers. For example, the self-concept scores of self-identified disabled (-0.03) and nondisabled (0.01) students were about the same. For the locus of control measure, however, students who selfidentified as disabled clearly scored lower on average than their nondisabled counterparts (-0.18 versus 0.06). This pattern is consistent with the one observed for students perceived to be disabled by either parents or teachers.  "}, {"section_title": "46", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "Differences in the background characteristics among the various disabled and nondisabled student populations in NELS:88 are apparent across several important dimensions, and the nature of these differences depends upon the source of information (parent, teacher, or student) used to identify students as disabled or nondisabled. In addition, results vary depending upon whether comparisons are made between the overall population of students identified as disabled or nondisabled or among selected disability categories. For example, students identified as disabled by their teachers or parents, as well as students who identified themselves as disabled, were more likely to be male than their nondisabled counterparts. For the specific category of health problems, however, teachers identified fewer males than were represented in the nondisabled population (36.7 percent versus 48.8 percent, respectively). In the case of minority status, the percentage of teacher-, parent-, and selfidentified disabled students who were minorities was proportionate to the nondisabled population. At the same time, teachers were more likely than parents to identify minority students as learning disabled (30.5 percent versus 18.3 percent, respectively). Finally, the psychological profiles of students identified as disabled by parents, teachers, and students themselves evidenced a consistent pattern over time of lower scores on locus of control measures. In contrast, measures of self-concept were consistently lower over time only for students whose teachers perceived them to be disabled, as compared to nondisabled students. \nJust as chapter 3 indicated differences in the background characteristics of students identified as disabled and those not identified, this chapter also shows consistent differences between the high school experiences of disabled and nondisabled students. These differences were largest in the areas of participation in special and remedial high school programs (disabled students participated more), and in credits accumulated in the core curriculum (disabled students earned fewer credits). Although some differences appear in the school experiences of students perceived to be disabled by different individuals (e.g., parents, teachers, school officials, or the students themselves), these differences were much less evident here than in chapter 3. One of the more interesting findings in this chapter concerns the extent to which students identified as disabled actually participated in special education programs during high school. The data suggest that relatively small percentages of these students reported themselves or were reported by school officials to have participated in programs designed to meet their special needs (i.e., programs for the educationally or physically handicapped, or special education programs in general); while substantially higher percentages reported having participated in remedial courses. It should be noted, however, that not all children with disabilities need special school services; for example, a child with a purely physical disability who receives the proper medical services for that disability may not require special school services. Under the IDEA, the term \"children with disabilities\" refers to children who have been evaluated and found to have a disabling condition that causes them to need special education services; however, many children with impairments do not require special education services, although they may receive remedial education services, accommodations, or other specialized services or instruction. Furthermore, for those students identified as disabled by their teachers in NELS:88, the linking of disability status to classroom performance may have caused many students to be identified as disabled who were, in fact, merely performing poorly on academic tasks. These data actually raise more questions than they answer about the services students with disabilities are receiving in the nation's high schools: What is the nature and quality of the services students with special needs are receivingwhether or not the students correctly identify these services? Are these serviceswhether \"remedial\" or \"special education\"adequately meeting these students' needs? Do the low levels of self-reported participation in special education programs, in fact, reflect a high level of underserved students with disabilities, or rather an increased inclusion of students with disabilities into general education programs, or merely the perceptions and misperceptions of students regarding the services they actually received at some time during high school?\nIt is clear from the results presented in this chapter that disability status is associated with less positive educational outcomes. Whether identified by teachers or parents, or by their reported participation in special education programs, students perceived to have disabilities recorded lower grades, lower scores on proficiency tests and lower gains in these test scores over time, and lower educational expectations beyond high school than did nondisabled students. The percentages of disabled students who dropped out during high school were almost twice to three times the percentages for nondisabled students. Given this overall pattern of findings, it remains important to identify differences in the outcomes achieved by students with different disabling conditions. For example, for many of the performance outcomes reviewed, students with health problems (as identified by parents or by teachers) were similar to nondisabled students. In contrast, students identified as having multiple disabilities and those with learning disabilities often recorded the lowest performance levels (e.g., as indicated by proficiency in mathematics or reading or by lower educational aspirations). Finally, students identified by their parents as having emotional problems recorded the lowest grades and the highest levels of school dropout. Taken together, these findings suggest different sets of problems and the need for different responses from schools to ameliorate them. For this report, several different definitions of disability status were developed based on NELS:88 survey information collected from parents, teachers, students, and school officials. Despite the lack of overlap across the populations of students identified in each of these ways, the patterns of difference between the various disabled and nondisabled student groups were similar to one another in many respects and were consistent with findings from previous studies (e.g., High School and Beyond and the National Transition Longitudinal Study). When identification of disability status was based on teachers' reports, the differences between disabled and nondisabled students were more extensive. These findings are reviewed below and are followed by a brief discussion of three general observations based on this work."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 4 The School Experiences of Students with Disabilities Overview", "text": "Chapter examined how the background characteristics of students with disabilities differed from the population of nondisabled students in NELS:88, and showed that the distributions of students with these characteristics depend upon the source of information used to define disability (e.g., whether parent or teacher responses were used to identify the student). In this chapter, a similar approach is used to examine the high school experiences of students perceived to have disabilities. Four general areas of the high school experience are the focus of discussion: (1) students' retention and participation in remedial and dropout prevention programs; (2) students' participation in programs designed to meet special educational needs; (3) students' academic experiences; and (4) students' and parents' involvement in extracurricular activities at school. As in chapter 3, this discussion highlights comparisons between populations of students with and without disabilities as a whole as identified by different sources, and across distinct disability categories. The comparison of students identified and not identified with disabilities in terms of their participation in special education programs serves two purposes: (1) it provides an estimate of the overall proportion of students served in these special programs, and (2) it provides a further check on the reliability of disability identifications made by parents and teachers."}, {"section_title": "Retention and Participation in Remedial and Dropout Prevention Programs", "text": "The high school experiences of students with disabilities are likely to be affected by students' successes and failures in earlier grades. Retention in grades prior to high school, for example, may result in students' being older than their peers in high school. Retention may also have a stigmatizing effect, from which some students undoubtedly find it difficult to recover. Table 4.1 shows the distribution of students whose parents reported they had ever repeated a grade prior to the eighth grade. Students identified as disabled by either parents or teachers more often repeated a grade than did students not identified. Parents reported that 40.7 percent of the identified students had repeated one or more grade levels prior to eighth grade, compared to 17.0 percent of the students not identified as disabled. Similar findings hold for those students identified by teachers as disabled: 30.8 percent of these students were reported to have repeated grades, compared to only 11.5 percent of the students not identified. Examining specific categories of disability, it appears that students identified as learning disabled (LD) by either parents or teachers showed a higher incidence of retention than students in other disability categories or in the overall population of students identified as disabled. Among students identified as LD by their parents and teachers, 52.8 percent and 42.8 percent, respectively, had been retained prior to eighth grade.  Table 4.2 shows data for students identified as disabled by their parents or teachers who reported themselves to have been in a remedial course or program for English and/or mathematics during high school. Once again, students identified as disabled were more likely than nondisabled students to report participation in high school remedial mathematics and English programs. Approximately 35 percent of parent-identified disabled students reported having participated in remedial mathematics and remedial English programs, compared to fewer than 20 percent of the nondisabled students. For teacher-identified students with disabilities, 35.3 percent had participated in remedial mathematics courses, compared to 17.5 percent of the nondisabled students. Examining specific categories of disability, students identified as LD by parents or teachers showed a higher incidence of participation in remedial courses than students in other disability categories. From 40 to 50 percent of these students had been in high school remedial programs. Students identified as having a health problem (HP) appear to be different from other disabled students and more similar to nondisabled students in terms of having participated in remedial mathematics or English courses; that is, 19.5 percent of the parentidentified HP group had participated in a remedial English program, compared to 17.8 percent 50 32 Profiles of Students with Disabilities as Identified in NELS:88 The School Experiences of Students with Disabilities of the nondisabled students. The level of participation in remedial programs for teacheridentified HP students was higher than that for nondisabled students but lower than that for students in the other disability categories. These data suggest that students with health problems may have had educational experiences that were distinct from those of students identified in other disability categories.  In addition to participation in high school remedial programs, students at the second followup were asked if they had ever been in a dropout prevention program in high school. Students identified as disabled reported a higher level of participation in dropout prevention programs than did their nondisabled counterparts (table 4.3). This difference in reported participation is most pronounced among students perceived by their teachers to be disabled. Among students identified by teachers, 4.2 percent reported participation in dropout prevention programs, compared to 1.1 percent of those not identified. For students identified by parents, the participation rates between disabled and nondisabled students were about the same: 2.9 percent versus 2.1 percent, respectively. Students reported lower levels of participation in dropout prevention programs than in the remedial programs shown in table 4.2, a finding that may be partly explained by the fact that remedial courses and programs are typically more available than dropout prevention programs in high schools.  "}, {"section_title": "Participation in Special Education Programs", "text": "Of particular interest to groups concerned about the educational well-being of students with disabilities is the extent to which these students participate in school-based programs designed specifically to meet their special needs. NELS:88 provides information to address this issue from student self-reports, the reports of school officials, and the reported experiences of students excused from the base-year survey for reasons of disability who had returned to the study by the time of the second follow-up. At the second follow-up, NELS:88 participants were asked to report whether they had ever participated in a \"special program for the educationally handicapped\" or a \"special program for the physically handicapped\" during high school. Table 4.4 summarizes students' self-reported participation in these special programs. As might be expected, students with disabilities reported having participated in these special programs to a greater extent than did their nondisabled counterparts. This finding holds true for students identified as disabled by their parents or teachers, although the levels of participation in programs for the educationally handicapped, for example, appear to be higher for students identified by parents. Nondisabled students reported a low level of participation in these special programs (from 0.5 percent participation in programs for the physically handicapped to 1.1 percent participation in programs for the educationally handicapped). In contrast, 11.2 percent of parent-identified disabled students and 4.5 percent of teacher-identified disabled students reported participation in programs for the educationally handicapped. Differences in the reported participation in The School Experiences of Students with Disabilities programs for the physically 'handicapped between the disabled and nondisabled as identified by teachers were less striking. Examining disabled versus nondisabled differences across specific disability categories identified by parents and teachers reveals consistently higher levels of participation in programs for the educationally handicapped among learning disabled students and students with multiple problems.\" About 22 percent of students identified by parents in each of these two disability groups, and between 7 and 8 percent of students identified by teachers in each group, reported having participated in a program for the educationally handicapped while in high school.  17 These comparisons involve no \"overlapping\" cases, but they do include students with other disabilities in addition to the focal disability in the focal group for the comparison (see the discussion in Appendix D)."}, {"section_title": "Profiles of Students with Disabilities as Identified in NELS:88 35", "text": "As discussed in chapter 2, school officials were asked, as part of the NELS:88 second followup, to identify those students who had ever been enrolled in high school special education programs, and a flag indicating such participation was entered in the students' second followup transcript file.' Table 4.5 shows the percentages of students by disability status reported by school officials to have participated in special education during high school. The pattern of participation in special education for these students, across disability categories based on parent and teacher reports, is similar to the pattern shown in table 4.4, although the levels of participation are different. The NELS:88 transcript files indicate participation in special education programs by 11.9 percent of students identified as disabled by parents, and by 7.8 percent of students identified by teachers. The levels of participation were highest for students with learning disabilities or multiple problems: about 20 percent participation for both groups of students identified by parents, and, among students identified by teachers, 13.7 percent for students with learning disabilities and 12.1 percent for students with multiple problems. Interestingly, the data presented in table 4.4 indicate relatively low levels of high school participation in special programs for the educationally and physically handicapped, as perceived and reported by students who were identified by parents or teachers as disabled The School Experiences of Students with Disabilities (i.e., from 2.0 to 11.2 percent of identified students).' School officials identified similarly low percentages of these students as having participated in special education (table 4.5). In contrast, a much larger proportion of these identified students reported having participated in remedial English and mathematics courses during high school (i.e., from 33.0 to 36.3 percent). These differences in reported participation rates for special education and remedial courses might be attributed to several factors, such as more numerous offerings of remedial courses than designated special education programs in high schools; increased inclusion or \"mainstreaming\" of special education students into general education programs, including remedial courses; the accuracy and completeness with which school officials identified students who had been enrolled in special education programs during high school; and students' knowledge and,Perceptions of the specific courses and programs in which they are enrolled. For example, students may simply not be aware of the specific programs or services they are receiving. Alternately, they may be more likely to identify a special education class as a remedial class, either because that is the way the class appears to them or because doing so enables them to feel less labeled, segregated, or different from other students."}, {"section_title": "Participation of Base-Year Ineligible Students in Remedial, Dropout Prevention, and Special Education Programs", "text": "Another way of examining the extent to which students with disabilities appear to participate in special programs in high school is provided in NELS:88 by the population of 188 students who were excused from participation in the base-year NELS:88 survey on the basis of mental disability, but who returned to participate in the first or second follow-up.' Of this sample of base-year ineligible (BY!) students, 42 percent reported having participated in a remedial English class, 44.6 percent participated in a remedial mathematics class, and 4.5 percent participated in a dropout prevention program.' These levels of participation in remedial classes and dropout prevention programs appear generally higher than the levels of participation reported for students who were identified as disabled by their parents and teachers. This may not be too surprising since the BYI students might be assumed to have had more significant cognitive impairments than the overall population of students with disabilities; as a result, they might well have been expected to need additional special services in school. It is interesting to note, however, that only 17.9 percent of these BYI students reported ever having been in a special program for the educationally handicapped.' This percentage is in the range of the 21.8 percent participation among parent-identified LD students, and would appear to be higher than the 8.0 percent among teacher-identified LD students. Table 4.6 shows the distribution of students in terms of total high school credit units in math, English, and science for students in the twelfth grade in 1992, as reported on their high school transcripts. Students identified as disabled by parents or teachers consistently earned fewer units in all three areas compared to nondisabled students. The magnitude of these differences was greater for students identified as disabled by teachers than it was for students identified by parents; the difference between teacher-identified disabled students and the nondisabled was about 0.7 units on average, while the difference was about 0.5 units for those identified by their parents as disabled. This finding is likely due to the fact that teachers' identifications of disability status were tied to their assessments of students' classroom performance."}, {"section_title": "Academic Experiences of Students with Disabilities", "text": "Differences across specific disabilities were not great; however, students identified by parents as having an emotional disability or multiple problems attained fewer credits in each academic area compared to students in the other disability categories.

When compared to nondisabled students, however, these teacheridentified HP students also earned fewer units in each of the three subject areas."}, {"section_title": "Participation in Extracurricular and PTA Activities", "text": "Participation in school activities is another facet of the high school experience in which disabled and nondisabled students may differ. On the one hand, the very nature of some specific disabilities may preclude disabled students from extracurricular activity participation; on the other hand, the possible stigma of having been identified as disabled may preclude these students from selection or acceptance in the activities by their peers. Participation of parents in school-related activities, such as parent-teacher associations (PTA), may also be affected by students' disability status. In this case, however, it is as easy to predict active parental involvement owing to greater concerns for disabled sons or daughters as it is to predict reduced or noninvolvement resulting from a recognition that their sons and daughters may not be active participants in the \"social\" life of the school. Table 4.7 explores students' participation in sports and in school clubs or school government at the time of the NELS:88 second follow-up survey, and parents' participation in PTA activities at the time of the base-year survey. Parents' activities reflect whether they attended PTA meetings regularly and whether they were active participants. For students, the values represent the number of sports in which they participated (summed over three possible sports activities in which students might have indicated they had taken part) and the number of 22 Only 2.7 percent of these BYI students reported having participated in a special program for the physically handicapped; however, this group of students had been excused from NELS:88 participation because of mental disability, and therefore would not be expected to participate in such programs.

The results show relatively similar levels of participation on the parts of both parents and students regardless of disability status when disability was identified by parents (table 4.7). In contrast, for disabled students identified by teachers, there was a consistent lower level of participation by parents of the disabled and by the disabled students themselves. Within the specific disability groups identified by parents, two differences emerge regarding parental participation in schools and student participation in activities. First, parents of students with multiple problems and parents of students with emotional problems were less active participants in PTA programs than were the parents of students in the other disability categories. Fewer than 15 percent of parents of students with these disabilities reported active PTA involvement, as compared to the near-to-above 20 percent participation rates for the parents of other disabled students. Second, while students with physical disabilities evidenced significantly lower levels of participation in sports, they were as active in school activities (e.g., participation in government and clubs) as students with other disabilities.   Table 4.8 examines students' participation in remedial programs from the perspective of students who identified themselves as disabled. The results are similar to those reported in table 4.2. As with those students identified as disabled by parents and teachers (see table 4.2), this self-identified group of students reported higher levels of participation in remedial English and remedial mathematics programs than did the nondisabled population. They also were more likely to be in a mathematics (42.9 percent) versus an English remedial program (32.1 percent), while for students identified by both parents and teachers (see table 4.2), participation rates in remedial mathematics and English programs were about the same (e.g., 35.3 percent versus 33.0 percent for students identified by teachers).  It is interesting also to look at the levels of participation in sports and other school activities among students who identified themselves as disabled, as well as the participation of their parents in school-related activities like PTA. Table 4.9 shows the reported involvements in extracurricular activities and PTA of these students and their parents. In general, it appears that this self-identified group of students and their parents participated in school-related activities to a similar extent as those students identified by their parents as disabled (see table 4.7).

Of particular interest to this report is how students identified as having disabilitiesoverall and by specific disability categorycompared in achievement to students without disabilities. As data from HS&B and the NLTS have indicated, students perceived to have disabilities might be expected to demonstrate lower academic performance than their nondisabled counterparts. As described below, data from NELS:88 show similar findings. Average Grades In English, Mathematics, and Science Table 5.1 presents an overview of the average grades during students' last year in high school in three basic areas of the curriculum. (The averages that are shown are based on a 1-to-13 point scale, where 1 = A+ and 13 = F.) Generally in all three subject areas, students identified as disabled by either parents or teachers earned lower grades (i.e., higher scores on the 13-point scale) than nondisabled students. For those identified with any disability by teachers, for example, the averages for each subject (English 8.48, mathematics 8.88, and science 8.80) were lower than those for students not identified as disabled (English 6.54, mathematics 7.22, and science 6.92). In general, the finding of lower grades for disabled students is consistent with earlier findings based on the HS&B population, where self-reported Profiles of Students with Disabilities as Identified in NELS:88 43 Educational Outcomes of Students with Disabilities grades of students identified as disabled by teachers and/or students themselves were significantly lower than those of nondisabled students (Owings and Stocking 1985).

Groups of test questions that were identified as being similar in content and difficulty reflected specific proficiency levels. Students achieved a specific proficiency level if they correctly answered at least three of the four questions within a proficiency level. Students at particular skill levels were assumed to have mastered the lower skill levels; likewise, students were assumed not to have mastered higher skill levels. Only students with complete and consistent response patterns were assigned proficiency levels. indicate a consistent negative relationship between disability status and level of proficiency (table 5.2). Whether identified by parents or teachers, disabled students were more likely to perform below level 1 or at levels 1 or 2 than were nondisabled students. This same pattern of lower performance for disabled students was also found for proficiency in reading (table 5.3). Of particular note in both tables 5.2 and 5.3 are the generally lower performance levels in reading and mathematics achieved by students identified as having learning disabilities or multiple problems. In mathematics, between 58.2 and 61.1 percent tested below level 1 or at level 1 (out of five levels). In reading, between 58.3 and 71.3 percent of these students tested below level 1 or at level 1 (out of three proficiency levels). In contrast, and consistent with findings reported earlier, students identified by either parents or teachers as having health problems scored at about the same proficiency levels in mathematics and in reading (for those identified by parents only) as did nondisabled students generally. Table 5.4 shows the changes in the estimated numbers of correct responses on reading and mathematics tests from the NELS:88 base year to the second follow-up survey. Although differences in these gain scores for disabled and nondisabled students may certainly be attributed to factors highly correlated with, but other than, disability conditions, they nevertheless provide insights into the important area of educational development. For students identified as disabled by parents, gains in mathematics proficiency fell short of those made by nondisabled students. At the same time, the gains in reading made by these disabled students were comparable to those made by nondisabled students over the same period. Comparing specific disability categories identified by parents to not identified students, LD students in particular evidenced lower gains in both reading and mathematics, from 1988 to 1992. In contrast, HP students performed about the same as not identified students. A pattern of more pronounced differences in gain scores between disabled and nondisabled students emerges for students perceived by their teachers to be disabled. For reading, test-score gains were generally smaller for most teacher-identified categories of disability than were the gains for nondisabled students. For example, those identified as LD showed an average increase of 3.94 in reading from 1988 to 1992 compared to 5.86 for the nondisabled group. For mathematics, the gains of nondisabled students outpaced those made by teacher-identified disabled students in any of the disability categories shown in the table. In this case for example, LD student gains over the 4-year period were less than two-thirds those of nondisabled students.    National Education Longitudinal Study, 1988 (NELS:88); Base-Year Parent Survey, First Follow-up Teacher Survey, Second Follow-up Student Survey. Taken together, these data for teacher-identified disabled students suggest that the differences in proficiency by disabled and nondisabled students observed in table 5.3 cannot be attributed entirely to initial differences between these students when they entered high school. Rather, the disparities in reading and mathematics test-score gains for disabled and nondisabled students may also be related to (1) the fewer units of mathematics and English accumulated by the disabled group; (2) the greater likelihood of these students being assigned to high school remedial English and mathematics programs, as was observed in the previous chapter; and (3) the fact that teachers' disability identifications are directly linked to students' classroom performance.

Given the differences so far observed between the high school experiences and performance of disabled and nondisabled students in NELS:88, we might expect to find differences among those students with respect to their educational expectations. In this section, we consider two different indicators of these expectations: students' and parents' estimates of eventual educational attainments and students' taking of college entrance examinations."}, {"section_title": "Expectations for Highest Education Level", "text": "At the NELS:88 second follow-up, both students and their parents were asked to indicate how much schooling they expected the students to attain. For students identified as disabled by parents, the educational expectations of both students and their parents were slightly lower than the expectations for the nondisabled students (table 5.5). The educational expectations of students identified as disabled by teachers also were lower than the expectations of Educational Outcomes of Students with Disabilities nondisabled students. Similarly, the parents of these teacher-identified disabled students had lower expectations for their sons and daughters than did the parents of nondisabled students. Taking parent-identified LD students as an example, slightly more than 30 percent of students had parents that expected them to attain less than a B.A. degree; for nondisabled students, fewer than 25 percent of their parents had set their expectations this low. For teacheridentified LD students, 12.5 percent of these students expected only to complete high school or less, compared to only 4.3 percent of the nondisabled group. Furthermore, more teacheridentified LD students had lower educational expectations than did the disabled group overall (12.5 percent versus 11.1 percent). Despite the pattern of lower educational expectations among disabled students, it is important to note that many of these students did aspire to college and beyond. For example, almost 50 percent of the students identified as learning disabled by their parents or teachers in 1992 expected to obtain at least 4 years of college education. The parents of these students were even more optimistic; more than 60 percent of the parents of teacher-or parent-identified LD students expected their sons and daughters to complete 4 or more years of college in 1992.

This indicator reveals differences between disabled and nondisabled students (table 5.6). For example, while almost one-half of the nondisabled students had taken or reported that they intended to take the SAT exam, 39.2 percent of the disabled students identified by parents and 30.1 percent of those students identified by teachers reported they had done so or planned to take the exam. For those students identified by teachers, students in each of the disability categories less frequently reported having taken or made plans to take the SAT exam than did nondisabled students. Even those students identified by teachers as having health problems were less likely than nondisabled students to have completed or planned for this exam. In contrast, students perceived by their parents to be disabled were more similar to nondisabled students when it came to completing or planning for the SAT. Parent-identified students in most of the disability categories reported a similar status to nondisabled students with respect to the SAT except for students with learning problems. Parent-identified LD students less often reported that they had completed or intended to complete the SAT. The results for the ACT generally follow the same patterns as for the SAT, especially for those students identified by teachers. Parent-identified students with disabilities generally evidenced lower levels of higher education preparation using the ACT indicator than with the SAT indicator.

In reviewing this table, it is important to note that the lower dropout rates for students identified by teachers may be explained by the particular teacher definition of disability/nondisability status used in this report. Specifically, students had to be enrolled in tenth grade (i.e., at the NELS:88 first follow-up) to be classified under this definition. Since teachers identified students with disabilities in the tenth grade, the dropout measure for those students effectively covers grades 10-12 only.

The dropout rates for students under each disability definition were much higher than those for the respective populations of nondisabled students, who reportedly dropped out at rates ranging from 6.2 to 14.8 percent.

In contrast to parent-or teacher-identified disabled students, however, self-identified students with disabilities in NELS:88 had lower grades than did nondisabled students only in English; their grades in mathematics and science were comparable to those of nondisabled students.

These efforts have involved the use of data compiled by the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP), as well as various surveys and national studies. For example, the Current Population Survey (CPS), the National Health Interview Survey on Child Health (NHIS/CH), High School and Beyond (HS&B), and the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) have all been used to provide these estimates. In addition, the National Longitudinal Transition Study of Special Education Students (NLTS), begun in 1987, was commissioned to describe the characteristics and experiences of students with disabilities. Across these varied data collection efforts, the criteria used to identify students with disabilities have been varied, ambiguous, and inconsistent. Because definitions of disability are often subjective, prevalence estimates based on one definition may differ substantially from estimates using another definition. This appendix supplements the discussion of chapter 2 by providing a listing of the actual indicators in NELS:88 related to disability status and disability-related services received. It then compares estimates based on NELS :88 and other sources of the prevalence of students with disabilities in the general population and estimates of the distribution of disabled students among various special education service categories. Table A.1 summarizes the primary indicators of disability status and disability-related services received, used in the NELS:88 Base-Year, First, and Second Follow-up Surveys (Parent, Student, and Teacher Questionnaires) and available from transcript data collected during the Second Follow-up.'

The NELS:88 data set includes other indicators that may also be related to disability status and services (e.g., academic /learning problems, enrollment in at-risk/remedial programs, discipline/attendance problems). Many of these indicators are used as dependent variables in this report."}, {"section_title": "NELS:88 Indicators of Disability Status and Services Received", "text": "Profiles of Students with Disabilities as Identified in NELS:88 A-1  *** In Owings and Stocking (1985), at least two or a majority of teacher respondents had to respond \"Yes\" for the students to be identified as disabled. 3 7 BEST COPY MAUS  . 2 NELS:88 data are derived from the base-year parent survey as follows: Weighted percentages in first column (% with condition) are derived from variable BYP47; weighted percentages in the second column (% received services) are derived from variable BYP48. The unbracketed percentages in these columns include only those students who were included in the 1988 base-year parent survey. They do not include students who were judged ineligible to participate in the base-year survey (i.e., the base-year ineligible, or BYI, students described in the last section of this appendix). These students are shown in the bracketed percentages, as explained in note 7 below. 5HS & B data abstracted from Owings, J. and Stocking, C. (1985). \"'Bracketed figure is the disability prevalence among the approximately 5 percent of students excluded from NAEP because of physical disability, mental disability, or language problem. Approximately 79 percent of excluded 13 yearsolds had a disability; the remainder had only a language problem. The first, unbracketed, percentage figure is the number of excluded students with a disability as a percent of total students. (In 1988, NAEP collected no data on the specific disability categories of included students.) Estimates of the Distribution of Students with Disabilities Table A.4 presents estimates of the distribution of students with specific disabilities among special education service categories. These estimates are derived from three sources: (1) OSEP's most recent estimates of students, ages 6-21, served in special education programs under IDEA, Part B, and ESEA, Chapter 1 (SOP) during the 1992-93 school year;2 (2) data from the NLTS on secondary school students with disabilities; and (3) parent reports from the NELS:88 base-year survey regarding whether eighth-grade students had a specific disabilityrelated problem(s) and whether they had ever received special services, for the problem(s). As shown in table A.4, students with specific learning disabilities represent a large proportion of the total population with disabilities: More than half of the populations reported by OSEP and NLTS are learning disabled as are more than one-quarter of the students with disabilities in NELS:88.3 The data also confirm that relatively small percentages of students fall within the disability categories that are generally considered to be \"low incidence\" categories (e.g., hearing impairments/deafness, visual impairments, deaf-blindness, other health impairments, orthopedic impairments). However, significant variations can be seen across the data sets, which may be attributed to different definitional criteria and data collection procedures. For example, the proportion of students with mental retardation (a relatively \"high-incidence\" category) is negligible in NELS:88 because the parent reports upon which these percentages are based did not include those students who were excused from participating in NELS:88 due to \"mental disability\" in the base year. In contrast, the proportion of students with multiple disabilities (a \"low-incidence\" category) in NELS:88 is disproportionately high because it includes all students whose parents indicated they had more than one disability-related problem or had ever received, services for more than one problem. The proportions of special education students with speech.and language impairments also show variation across data sets (3.4 percent in NLTS to 21.:7 percent in OSEP), probably due in part to the different age ranges of the populations and the'farc:t that higher proportions of elementary school children have speech and language impdirnients and receive services for them than secondary school students do. (The OSEP data include students ranging in age from 6 to 21, while the NLTS and NELS:88 data include students 13 or more years of age.) Probably for similar age-related reasons, the speech and language impairment category includes a much higher proportion of eighth-grade students in NEES& whose parents report them to have ever received services for \"speech problems\" (24.4 percent) than to currently have a \"speech problem\" (5.6 percent). These varied estimates of the distribution of students with disabilities 2 Each year, the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP), U.S. Department of Education, is required under P.L.  to collect, analyze, and report data to Congress to \"assess the extent to which all students with disabilities are receiving a free, appropriate public education.\" According to OSEP's most recent report, approximately' 4.6 million, or 8 percent, of the nation's children, ages 6.21, received special education services during the 1992-93 school year (under IDEA, Part B, and Chapter 1/ESEA.SOP). OSEP's total estimate is similar to the service population estimate of 7.9 percent, provided in 1980 by the Office of Civil Rights and reported by NCES in its 1985 report on disabilities based on HS&B (Owings and Stocking 1985). 3 The actual percentage of learning disabled students in NELS:88 is higher because, according to NELS:88 parent reports, about 54 percent of the students classified under \"multiple disabilities\" had learning disability-related problems. AI 0 Profiles of Students with Disabilities as Identified in NELS:88 across special education service categories again underscore the complicated nature of the population of students with disabilities who are the focus of this report. Two weighted percentage columns are provided for NELS:88 data. The first, \"Received services,\" presents the distribution of percentages of students reported by parents to have ever received services for a disability-related problem (BYP48) in the base-year survey. The second, \"Has disability,\" presents the distribution of percentages of students reported by parents to have a disability-related problem (BYP47) in the base-year survey. 'The \"Multiple disabilities\" category in the OSEP and NLTS data sets represents a separate and discrete disability category. It is a low-incidence disability category that includes students who are generally severely impaired and low functioning. \"Multiple disabilities\" was not a separate disability response category in the NELS:88 parent survey; rather, it is a composite category that includes students whose parents indicated they had more than one disability-related problem or had received services for more than one problem-hence, the relatively high proportion of students with \"multiple disabilities\" in NELS:88. "}, {"section_title": "Students with Disabilities Excused from National Studies", "text": "As described in the 1995 NCES report, Sample Exclusion and Undercoverage in NELS :88, some students have been systematically excused from participation in cross-sectional assessments such as NAEP and from longitudinal studies including HS&B and NELS:88. Traditionally, students have been excused from participation in these studies primarily on the basis of mental or physical disability or limited-English proficiency. For example, the \"exclusion criteria\" for NAEP from 1990 to 1994 specified that a student identified as having an Individualized Education Program (IEP) or equivalent classification may be excluded from the assessment if (1) \"the student is mainstreamed less than 50 percent of the time in academic subjects and is judged incapable of participating meaningfully in the assessment,\" OR (2) \"the IEP team or equivalent group has determined that the student is incapable of participating meaningfully in Profiles of Students with Disabilities as Identified in NELS:88 A-11 the assessment\" . Similarly, NELS:88 excused \"mentally handicapped students and students not proficient in English, for whom the NELS:88 tests would be unsuitable; and students having physical or emotional problems that would make participation in this survey unwise or unduly difficult.\" This policy of selective exclusion and its impact on resulting data, due to undercoverage bias, have been the subject of recent debate. For example, efforts are underway, under Section 421(c)(3) of the Perkins Act, to facilitate appropriate assessments of these traditionally excluded students to \"ensure valid and reliable comparisons with the general student population...\" (Inge ls 1995). Similarly, NAEP is currently re-evaluating its criteria for excusing students from participation, and NELS:88 has taken steps to follow up BYI students and to reassess their eligibility for participation as described below. To develop a comprehensive picture of students with disabilities using any additional data set, it is important to consider the potential bias resulting from the exclusion of students who were judged ineligible to participate on the basis of disability. To permit examination of this issue, NELS:88 procedures included (1) collection of descriptive data on students excused from this study (i.e., base-year ineligible, or BYI, students), and (2) periodic review of the survey eligibility of these students and their inclusion in subsequent follow-ups to the extent possible. As a result of these periodic reviews, almost 200 students who were BYI on the basis of judged mental or physical disability subsequently became eligible to participate in NELS:88 followups. 4 Which students were excused from NELS:88? During the base year, some 584 8th-graders, representing 4.7 percent of the entire eighth-grade population, were excluded from NELS:88 for reasons of physical, mental, or language barriers. As shown in figure A.1, most of these students were excused for reasons of mental disability (331 students, or 66 percent). This group likely included students with mental retardation who were otherwise missing from the NELS:88 database.' Demographic data are available for this entire BYI sample, and more extensive data are available for the approximately 188 BYI students with mental disabilities who subsequently were judged by school personnel as eligible to participate in the NELS follow-up surveys.6 problem and description of a service received for that problem, may be preferred as it likely increases the accuracy of parents' judgments of disability status. 1.9 (a) \"Multiple problems\" is a composite category disability-related problem/service received.

Although it appears from columns 1 and 2 in table B.1 that the largest discrepancies in parents' reports of problems and services were related to speech, specific learning, and other health problems, columns 3 and 4 of the table indicate the considerable lack of overlap between reports of problems and services received over all the disability categories. Sinceour aim is to identify students with disabilities in the base year, the data from column 1 of table B.1 are the most pertinent; however, there is a marked gain in confidence about the accuracy of these estimates when they are associated with the data from column 2. (Note that students identified in column 2 may include those who either outgrew or had ameliorated for them a previously detected disability.) Simply put, the students identified in column 4 (i.e., those who were reported to have disability-related problems in 1988 and to have ever received services for those problems) are those who seem most likely to have had a disability at the time of the base-year survey. To provide sufficient sample sizes for analysis, it is useful to combine the disability categories in a meaningful way. Table B.2 presents the unweighted sample sizes and (base-year) weighted population percentages associated with the categorization scheme.used in this report. The clustering of disabilities shown in table B.2 is based on consideration of both the similarities of particular disability types and the need for comparability with the other disability indicators available from NELS:88. As shown, the sample sizes for learning disability (LD) and other B-2 Profiles of Students with Disabilities as Identified in NELS:88 health problems (HP) are sufficient for these disability types to be presented and analyzed separately, although the few cases of mental retardation have been added into the LD category because both are cognitive disabilities. Physical disability (P) includes orthopedic problem and other physical disability; emotional problem (E) represents a single disability-related problem in NELS:88; and sensory problem (SE) includes visual handicap, hearing problem, deafness, and speech problem. A composite category, physical or emotional problem (PE), has been created to provide comparability between the samples of students identified by parents and those identified by teachers, since the NELS:88 teacher surveys combine these two disability categories, as discussed below. Students Identified by Teachers as Disabled Table B.3 presents the unweighted sample sizes and weighted population percentages of students identified as disabled by at least one teacher during the base year or first follow-up. Table  B.3 is designed to create comparability of teacher data across the base year and first follow-up; it provides consistent teacher definitions of disability status over time, which can be used for either cross-sectional or panel analyses of data. Column 1 of this table provides the (base-year) weighted population percentages in each disability category included on that year's survey.

Column 2 provides the (first follow-up) weighted population percentages in the three disability categories covered by the survey in 1990 (e.g., health problem, physical or emotional handicap, and both [multiple problems]). Column 3 describes students in the first follow-up cross-sectional sample, including students in the \"freshened\" sample who were reported as having either of these problems in the base year or first follow-up (i.e., those students who were ever identified as disabled in the base year or first follow-up). Columns 4 and 5 show the (first follow-up-panel)7 weighted population percentages of the students who were identified by at least one teacher as having ever fallen behind due to a health problem or as currently having a physical or emotional handicap in either (column 4) and both (column 5) time periods.' Together, the columns in table B.3 describe five possible approaches to using comparable teacher data to define students' disability status between the base year and first follow-up. Columns 1 and 2 are the most straightforward definitions of disability status. However, use of column 1 provides no opportunity to examine students with teacher-identified learning disabilities because the base-year teacher survey did not include an indicator for learning disability. Similarly, columns 4 and 5, which may respectively provide the most inclusive and \"Multiple problems\" includes those students whose teacher(s) indicated had more than one category of problem.

The strength of the rationale for use of any of the definitions in columns 3 through 5 of table B.5 depends on the suspected accuracy of students' reports, the overlap between the reported information for individual students at the two time-points, and the comparisons to be made with disability definitions from other sources. Owings and Stocking (1985), for example, note that student self-reports of disability status are subject to change over time, suggesting that the first and second follow-up NELS:88 items on special program participation might define two distinct disability populations. In fact, table B.6 shows that this is the case. In addition, the comparisons that might be made with disability estimates based on other NELS:88 data sources favor keeping these populations separate in analysis. For example, the population defined by students' responses at first follow-up can be compared to the population defined by teachers' first follow-up responses. Similarly, the population defined by students' responses at second follow-up can be compared to the population defined by school officials' judgments of students' disability status, as described below. In this report, we limit our focus to the studentdefined disabled population identified at the NELS:88 first follow-up, since it is the definition most proximate in time to those provided by parents and teachers.

Of these excluded students, about two-thirds (66 percent) were excused due to mental disability. In NELS:88 follow-up surveys, special efforts were made to reassess whether these and other excused students should be allowed to participate. These efforts resulted in the return of 133 BYI students with mental disabilities to the NELS:88 first follow-up and 156 such students to the second follow-up. The progress of these students through the education system provides yet another perspective on the educational experiences of disabled students for this report.
