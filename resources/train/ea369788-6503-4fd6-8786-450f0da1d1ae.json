[{"section_title": "", "text": "Doing so is particularly important in southwest Florida as nearly 45% of the sandy shoreline in the study area has been nourished, and this figure is likely to rise as SLR results in greatly increased erosion. This study had three main objectives: 1) to critically assess the effectiveness of existing federal, state, and local policies that will positively affect these two groups of species, and effectiveness at responding to SLR among current coastal management policies and management strategies in Southwest Florida, using publicly available agency documents; 2) to critically assess the effectiveness at protecting those species, and at responding to SLR, in the ways in which coastal management projects, particularly beach nourishment projects, have been implemented over the 15-year target period; and 3) to make recommendations for actions that can be included in policies and coastal management plans in Southwest Florida to improve resiliency of sandy beach habitats, especially as habitats upon which nesting bird and sea turtle species depend. The research reviewed 28 municipalities' Comprehensive Plans and Land Development Codes (LDCs) that were reviewed. Only four of those made direct mention of SLR, and all of those were written by county-level agencies (as opposed to cities or other sub-county units): Collier County, Charlotte County, Sarasota County, and Pinellas County. Documents for the majority of the reviewed municipalities investigated made little or no mention of nesting sea turtles or beachnesting birds. The research then reviewed state and federal policies for consideration of sea-level rise, nesting sea turtles, and beach-nesting birds. There was some overlap and considerable gaps in protective policy or application of existing policy toward beach nourishment project permits. The United States Army Corps of Engineers is required to incorporate current and projected sea-level rise into coastal management projects; however, this guidance is subject to interpretation, economic factors, and political decisions. The State of Florida and local municipalities do not have any requirement to incorporate sea-level rise into beach nourishment projects. Most permitted beach nourishment projects were not designed for nesting sea turtles and did not incorporate a turtle-friendly slope or one that mimics natural beaches. Not one of the 36 nourishment projects in these counties was built with a turtle-friendly lower slope as none of them specified a change in slope below the berm. Of the 36 beach nourishment project permits reviewed, 83% did have turtlefriendly upper slopes, and 74% did not have a turtle-friendly berm, defaulting to a flat 0% berm slope.

The research makes several recommendations for coastal managers and planners for increasing resiliency for nesting sea turtles and beach-nesting birds under the threat of sea-level rise. Local, state, and federal coastal planners should incorporate local and predicted SLR rates into beach nourishment and coastal zone management. A beach built with more volume would be more resilient to SLR and storm events and increasing the elevation of the beach would reduce overwash and flooding of nesting habitat. Development of policy that requires sea turtle friendly slopes is a vital step to properly managing nesting habitat for sea turtles. Using a site-based approach, coastal managers can work with biologists to identify areas where beach-nesting birds occurred historically or where they can incorporate beach-nesting bird habitat into their beach nourishment projects. Many conservation measures can be incorporated into the beach nourishment permitting process to help provide resilience for these species that will increase the amount of preferred nesting habitat for sea turtles and beach-nesting birds in concert with beach nourishment projects."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 1. Introduction", "text": "Relative sea-level rise (SLR) has been observed in the US and globally since the recording of water levels began (Church and White, 2006). SLR may have a large and cumulative effect on coastal and tidal habitats. Southwest Florida may be especially affected due to its extensive coast and low-lying topography, particularly its sandy beaches where sand sources are limited. Many agencies in Southwest Florida manage coastal habitats and resources and make decisions to mitigate the effects of development and erosion on sandy beaches. These managers employ techniques such as beach nourishment, dredging, and erosion control structures. Individual managers at many separate institutions make these decisions, and those managers do not always have access to the best scientific information and state of the art on management practices regarding beach structures that best protect their dependent species and are most resilient to SLR. Entities in Southwest Florida with responsibilities for beach and coastal management include the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and many county and city government agencies. These entities have enacted statutes, regulations, policies, and procedures (hereafter collectively referred to as policy) that drive coastal management projects such as beach nourishment. These policies can include adaptation measures for SLR, such as altering nourishment design to increase project lifespan. In the absence of overarching responsibility or policy guidance, these agencies may not incorporate actions that should be included in routine projects to respond appropriately to the threats imposed by SLR. In most cases, each entity has jurisdiction over a stretch of shoreline, while lacking overarching authority, thus limiting region-wide coordination and collaboration. Effective planning might include active and passive measures that increase resilience of beaches to withstand the effects of SLR. At present there is no overarching policy or guidance at the federal, state, or local level to encourage this kind of action. It is not well known to responsible agencies what extent these actions are currently being implemented and what kinds of projects and policies might be available to enhance responses to SLR and mitigate impacts on sea turtles and beach-nesting birds. This research identifies those actions most widely implemented by federal, state, and local coastal decision makers in Southwest Florida as responses to SLR on sandy beach habitats. This research also identifies widely implemented and recommended management actions and policies and critically assesses elements in common as well as the rationale behind them. This study recommends the best existing scientific information and coastal management and SLR policies that will benefit Southwest Florida beaches and their dependent species, specifically beach-nesting birds and sea turtles, by increasing resilience from the threat of SLR. Coastal managers are in a position to make use of adaptive management strategies to improve resiliency for sandy beach dependent species. It may be a challenge of limited resources, limited space, differing public perceptions, and competing agency missions to apply designs to projects that not only meet human needs (e.g., beach nourishment) but also explicitly help sea turtles and beach-nesting birds by allowing sandy beaches to function as resilient ecosystems."}, {"section_title": "Research Objectives", "text": "The first objective of this study was to critically assess the effectiveness of existing beach management policies using publicly available agency documents to identify and evaluate response to SLR among current coastal management policies and management strategies within a study area in Southwest Florida. This objective also assesses whether existing policies consider habitat management for species that depend on sandy beaches. The second objective was to determine how policy has been implemented into coastal management projects. This objective will reveal if policy direction existed or had been implemented into permitting practices that might enhance beach habitat quality and quantity in ways that would increase the ability of beach-dependent species to persist under SLR. The third objective was to make recommendations for action that can be incorporated into Southwest Florida coastal management policy to improve resiliency of sandy beach habitats and their associated beach-nesting birds and sea turtles. These recommendations are supported by the best current understanding of the problem which can serve as valuable management practices for those agencies managing sandy beach habitats along with the focal species of this study, beach-nesting birds and nesting sea turtles. The hypothesis of this research is that there are coastal zone management options that provide more resiliency to sandy beach habitats, beach-nesting birds and nesting sea turtles than the management options and polices in use today."}, {"section_title": "Research Approach", "text": "The first step was to conduct a policy analysis through review of existing rules, regulations, guidelines, and policies that govern coastal management activities impacting beach-nesting birds and sea turtles in Southwest Florida. Policies and management strategies of agencies with coastal management responsibilities were acquired and reviewed, and specific policies that manage for beach-nesting birds, sea turtles, or SLR were identified. The purpose was to identify what policies, if any, are currently used to benefit beach-nesting birds and sea turtles in each of the jurisdictions within the study area. To further determine how policy is implemented, the researcher reviewed and analyzed permits of coastal management projects in Southwest Florida permitted by the Florida DEP between 2000 and 2015. Florida DEP issues Joint Coastal Permits which can be found online for these projects. These permits were reviewed to determine if sandy beach dependent species or SLR have been considered in the design of coastal management projects. This step also revealed any specific management actions that may have been taken to help coastal systems adapt to the threat of SLR."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 2. Literature Review", "text": "The study area includes the coastal counties of Southwest Florida from Pinellas County in the north through Collier County in the south. The region has extensive sandy beach shorelines that are very important to the tourism economy (Murley et al., 2005) and as habitat for coastal dependent species such as beach-nesting birds (Himes et al., 2006;Lott et al., 2009;Sprandel et al., 2000) and sea turtles (NMFS/USFWS, 2008). These sandy beaches are characterized by moderate to high wave energy, with open beaches and dune systems. Sea turtles, shorebirds, and beach-nesting birds (among many other species) depend on sandy beaches as habitats for parts or all of their life cycles."}, {"section_title": "Evidence of Sea-Level Rise", "text": "Sandy beaches in Southwest Florida face threats and stressors, ranging from pollution to coastal development to climate change, that affect their habitat are similar to impacts observed at beaches around the world (DeFeo et al., 2009). Climate change may ultimately be the greatest threat to sandy beach habitats. As the effects of climate change have been better understood, it has become clear that atmospheric warming is coupled with relative sea-level rise (Rahmstorf, 2007;Vermeer and Rahmstorf, 2009;IPCC, 2013). This warming has led to glacial melting and thermal expansion of the oceans, thus contributing to relative sea-level rise (IPCC, 2013). Globally, rates of sea-level rise have increased from 1.7 mm/yr between 1900 and the mid-1990s to approximately 3.2 mm/yr subsequent to 1990 (Church and White, 2011). SLR has accelerated since the 1990s and is projected to reach an additional 0.44 meters to 0.74 meters above current levels by 2100 (Church et al., 2013). There is significant evidence of sea-level rise all along the Florida coast as evidenced by National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services from NOAA CO-OPS tide gauge data (NOAA, 2018). Rates range from to 3.68 mm/yr at the Lake Worth Pier to 2.11 mm/yr at Fernandina Beach, although it is important to note that Fernandina Beach has been recording data since the late 1890s with a break from the mid-1920s to the late 1930s. In addition, the Lake Worth Pier has only been recording data since the early 1970s, also with significant data gaps. Douglas (1991) found that at least 50 years of continuous tide gauge data are needed to make a reasonable estimate of SLR to avoid the masking effects of seasonal and periodic cycles such as the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation. The two most widely referenced locations for relative SLR in Florida are Pensacola and Key West because they have the longest periods of continuous data. Observations from Pensacola indicate a rate of 2.31 mm/yr which yields a rate of 0.76 feet per century, while Key West observations indicate a rate of 2.4 mm/yr or 0.79 feet per century. These estimates are empirical and are based on direct observation. Because the estimates are derived from very long records tide gauge records, greater than 80 years in each case, acceleration can be detected with proper statistical analysis. However, other methods such as satellite altimetry can detect acceleration much more quickly and they suggest SLR may be accelerating at a rate of 0.084 \u00b1 0.025 mm/yr (Nerem et al., 2010). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2013) estimated that globally relative sea-level rose 0.19 m between 1901 and 2010 and will rise another 0.28 to 0.98 m by 2100. The IPCC projects that SLR will accelerate in the next century due to increased thermal expansion and ice melt. It should be noted that IPCC projections are generally considered to be conservative. Sweet et al. (2017) project that global sea-level may rise from 0.3 m to a worst-case scenario of 2.5 m by 2100. However, they note that the low-estimate scenario has at least a 94% chance of being exceeded. Florida's Gulf Coast will likely be affected reasonably uniformly by global sea-level rise, but unanticipated changes in wind, wave, and current patterns may cause short or longterm differences accelerating SLR at some coastal locations (Mitchum et al., 2017). In fact, Mitchum et al. (2017) suggested using a 4-foot to 6-foot rise in sea-level for agencies conducting planning analyses to 2100."}, {"section_title": "Geomorphological Effects of Sea-Level Rise", "text": "The effect of SLR on coastal systems can be severe and chronic and can vary by location. Episodic storms and storm surge are two major exacerbating factors. Zhang et al. (2004) found that loss of coastal land from erosion due to episodic storms and storm surge can be two orders of magnitude higher than predicted from continuous processes. SLR can also alter sediment budgets for barrier islands, increase the size of bays and estuaries, increase the tidal prism, and alter the function of ebb and flood shoals (FitzGerald et al., 2008;Irish et al., 2010). The effects of SLR on different types of beaches depends on their gradient, configuration of the coast, and other local factors. Low-gradient beaches, which harbor the highest biodiversity of invertebrates and upon which sea turtles and beach-nesting birds depend, may be more highly impacted due to the greater size of the swash zone (Defeo et al., 2009). These lower-elevation beaches inevitably may lose more of their area than wider, higher beaches under any scenario of SLR (Fish et al., 2005)."}, {"section_title": "Biological Effects of Sea-Level Rise", "text": "Sea-level rise will have profound impact on humans, coastal habitats, and their dependent species. Sea turtles such as the loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and green (Chelonia mydas) require sandy beaches for nesting. Southwest Florida is an important part of the northwest Atlantic loggerhead population (National Marine Fisheries Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2008). Data suggest that changing conditions are already impacting these species. From 1989 to Part of this decline may also include beach nourishment (NMFS/USFWS, 2008). It is likely sea turtles will be strongly impacted by SLR (Fish et al., 2008). SLR will also cause increased erosion and landward migration of sandy beaches (Davidson-Arnott, 2005) which may not have the space to migrate due to human coastal development (the so-called \"coastal squeeze\" [Doody, 2004]). This will lead to loss of sandy beaches and ultimately threaten populations of nesting sea turtles (Fish et al., 2005;Reece et al., 2013). Inundation of a beach increases the chances of a sea turtle nest egg chamber being flooded, resulting in the death of the embryos. Beach inundation would also bring waves farther up the beach, allowing erosive wave action to reach and destroy sea turtle nests. Left to natural processes, beaches with good nesting characteristics might simply move inland as sea-level rises, leaving nesting sea turtles unaffected. However, in much of Southwest Florida, land use patterns are such that spaces inland of beaches are altered by human development and subject to squeeze so that these beaches cannot reform as functional nesting sites. In the absence of direct management efforts (Fish et al., 2008), SLR leads sea turtles to nest on increasingly narrow beaches between the tide line and human development, thereby reducing or eliminating nesting habitat (Fish et al., 2008;Fuentes and Cinner, 2010) without direct management efforts (Fish et al., 2008). The impact to sea turtles from SLR is compounded by human-conducted changes, including armoring and beach nourishment in areas of sea turtle nesting (Mazaris et al., 2009). Many bird species that utilize Southwest Florida beaches are subject to similar habitat pressures. Beach-nesting birds require sandy beaches for nesting habitat and Southwest Florida is particularly important for species such as such as Wilson's Plover (Charadrius wilsonia), Snowy Plover (Charadrius nivosus), and Black Skimmer (Rynchops niger) (FWC, 2013). Some beach-nesting birds, such as the Snowy Plover and Wilson's Plover, require sandy beach habitat for the majority of their life cycle. Shorebirds such as Black-bellied Plovers (Pluvialis squatarola), Dunlin (Caldris alpina), and Sanderlings (Calidris alba) require sandy beaches for wintering habitat and as feeding areas during migration to their nesting grounds (Sprandel et al., 2000). Shorebirds and beach-nesting birds in particular, such as Snowy Plovers and Least Terns which are listed by the State of Florida as Threatened, may be greatly impacted by loss of feeding and nesting habitat that is critical to migratory shore birds (Chu-Agor et al., 2012;Galbraith et al., 2002;Goss-Custard et al., 1994;Galbraith et al., 2002;Chu-Agor et al., 2012). Beach-nesting birds may be minimally affected by SLR if barrier island processes such as rollback is not constrained by development (Seavey et al., 2011) but few barrier islands have remained undeveloped in Southwest Florida, so that habit too has been lost."}, {"section_title": "Human Responses to Sea-level Rise", "text": "The reaction of humans to SLR has been typically described as one of three general categories: protection, retreat or adaptation (Nichols, 2011). Retreat is the removal of humans, development, and infrastructure from the coast. Retreat is politically, economically, and socially difficult and requires new development to be setback from the coast and ultimately, the removal of threatened structures (Berry et al., 2013). Because living and recreating near the coast has such high economic and aesthetic value, societal pressure makes it challenging to enact policies that remove existing nearshore development or create setback requirements for new development. Implementation of such policies has been rarely accomplished except for the most extreme cases or when coastal land is less valuable, such as agricultural lands (Berry et al., 2013). Most coastal land uses are more likely to address SLR through adaptation. it is one basis for the FEMA National Flood Insurance Program (Michel-Kerjan and Kousky, 2011). NFIP requires that homes and buildings be designed to current anticipated flooding levels by elevating them or designing them to be resilient to surge. This adaptation has traditionally not looked at long term stressors such as SLR. Human adaptation to SLR is being addressed in some locations such as Southeast Florida through the Southeast Florida Climate Compact (Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact Technical Ad hoc Work Group, 2011). Coastal adaptation to SLR that considers coastal species and habitats is a relatively new concept (Defeo et el., 2009). Although coastal managers may be able to reduce impacts from SLR by hardening of shorelines to protect human development and infrastructure, these methods may result in losses of wildlife habitats (Defeo et al., 2009;Fish et al., 2008;Galbraith et al., 2002;Hughes, 2004). Ultimately, the cumulative impact of such structures may prevent ecosystems from migrating inland due to SLR (Titus et al., 2009). Coastal managers and natural resource managers routinely employ strategies designed to manipulate coastal systems for societal purposes (e.g., beach nourishment) or alter habitat to increase habitat quality or quantity for listed species (Flanders, 2006;Maslo et al., 2011). However, few projects are designed to do both and even fewer incorporate SLR into management decisions. For example, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is responsible for dredging and is increasingly designing dredging projects to reuse the dredged material. This \"beneficial use of dredged material\" has been used to design projects to create, restore, and enhance nesting and feeding areas for beach-nesting birds (Spear et al., 2007;Yozzo et al., 2004). Some agencies are aware of the threat that SLR causes and are taking active measures to adjust their policy and management. The USACE is responsible for construction and management of a wide range of civil and defense projects throughout the United States and, in particular, coastal management projects such as erosion control and beach nourishment. As part of its decision process, the USACE has sought to understand how SLR can impact a project in varying ways at various locations, creating a Sea-level Rise Calculator (USACE, 2018). The Sea-level Rise Calculator uses sea-level rise rates for a given location using nearby tide gauges and SLR scenarios from Parris et al. (2012) and the New York City Panel Climate Change report (Horton et al., 2015). This calculator offers the user options of using a low, medium, or high scenario. The current observed historic rate represents the lowest scenario. These scenarios reflect different estimates based upon greenhouse emissions, global temperature changes, and glacial melting. Stated practice of the USACE (2013) is to incorporate relative SLR rise into all of its projects exposed to any tidal influence. In practical terms, this means that on a given beach nourishment project, the future elevation of the ocean relative to the elevation of the beach to be constructed must be considered and changes to the project must be incorporated (USACE, 2013) so that the elevation of the finished project will remain above a specified sea-level expected to be reached at some date in the future. This is intended to mitigate impacts on the project from changes such as higher storm surges, increased incidences of flooding, and more frequent inundation. The Calculator tool provides a wide range of estimates that can be adapted for each coastal location so that USACE projects and structures will not be submerged in the future due to SLR. Natural beaches typically exhibit changes in slope (Fig. 1) as compared to a traditional beach nourishment construction template (Fig. 2). Further, natural beaches do not have a flat berm but rather a berm that slopes down from the dune line, as opposed to traditional beach nourishment construction that use flat berms. \"It just made physical sense to build it this way (with a natural slope) and \u2026 it is difficult to understand why anyone would build the beach flat which is averse to nature (Bodge, K.R., pers. comm.).\"  One major reason SLR is not included in habitat protection efforts is the uncertainty of SLR scenarios and what impacts they will have on coastal projects and species (Fish et al., 2005). Fuentes and Cinner (2010) found coastal managers and scientists have differing opinions and high levels of uncertainty regarding the effects of climate change on some species as well as the best management options to allow these species to persist. Other researchers suggest that there is a disconnect between scientists studying sea-level rise and coastal zone managers, who should be or already are planning for SLR (Doyle et al., 2010;Pearlstine et al., 2010;Tribbia and Moser, 2008). To increase resiliency, coastal managers might, at a minimum, adjust management planning towards habitat and restoration priorities to deal with SLR, sandy beach ecosystems, and their dependent species (Doyle et al., 2010;Pearlstine et al., 2010)."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 3. Methods", "text": "The current study relied on three major task areas. The first was to identify and critically evaluate ways in which municipalities in the study area of Southwest Florida address SLR within their current coastal management policies and management strategies. This task assessed whether those existing policies consider habitat management for species dependent on sandy beaches and the impacts from SLR on those species. This task was conducted using internet searches to review agencies' publicly available and planning documents. This task also drew upon the researcher's lengthy and deep professional engagement with beach management policies in the region for insights into the practical implications of policies and strategies as stated in the municipalities' documentation. This research analyzes only that group of policies in the \"adaptation\" category, not in the \"retreat\" category, and focuses exclusively on the widely-implemented practice of beach nourishment of sandy beaches. Retreat of human structures and habitat from the coastline in Southwest Florida is not currently economically or politically feasible therefore it will not be addressed in this study. The second set of tasks was to critically assess the kinds of actions and strategies addressing SLR that have been included in permitting of coastal management projects in the study areas for projects permitted during the period 2000-2015. The task evaluates how policies and strategies have been implemented in practice, consisting of a content breakdown of local Comprehensive Plans and land development codes. The intent was to reveal whether policy direction existed or had been implemented into permitting projects to enhance beach habitat quality and quantity in ways that would increase the ability of these species to persist under SLR. This task included review of Joint Coastal Permits (JCP), which are permits issued by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP); and the associated conditions and special conditions attached to those permits. Conditions and special conditions of a permit specify the methods of construction, monitoring, management practices, and conservation methods of a project to manage sandy beach habitats for nesting sea turtles and beach-nesting birds in Southwest Florida. The information was acquired through literature review, internet searches, and review of agencies' publicly available files in the study area. The third set of tasks was to use the above information to make informed recommendations about the kinds of actions that municipalities and agencies in Southwest Florida could incorporate to improve resiliency of sandy beach habitats and species that depend upon them. The recommendations are intended to serve as valuable management practices for agencies managing sandy beach habitats and the focal species of this study."}, {"section_title": "Study Area", "text": "The geographic study area was the Southwest Florida Gulf of Mexico coast: Collier, Lee, Charlotte, Sarasota, Manatee, and Pinellas Counties.

A major part of the reviewed documents was the Comprehensive Plans and Land Development Codes (LDC) from 28 municipalities from the target region. All documents were downloaded, then content analysis was conducted for any aspects of the documents relating to beach nourishment, coastal management, sediment management, inlet management, coastal dredging, sea turtles or, beach-nesting birds. Nearly all municipalities in the study area host their Comprehensive Plans on their websites or on a third-party website such as Municode.com.

The approach uses a Likert scale (Likert, 1932a(Likert, , 1932b to assign these attributes a numerical value based upon a well-defined narrative description of each of the five score categories, for each of the attributes. The continuum used ranges from no defined policy to use of best available science in the development of a policy (Table 2). This analysis requires judgment of a well-informed expert in the field. As a result, training and experience would be required for a regulatory agency to replicate this analysis using existing staff or citizen volunteers. The attributes used in the current study could be further developed with additional specific information, but it is important to keep in mind that attributes are subject to change as additional scientific information emerges (such as recommendations for specific beach slopes for turtle nesting, or restriction of visitors during specific breeding seasons of nesting birds). Developing methodology at this level of detail is beyond the scope of the current study and is likely to be of limited usefulness in the future because appropriate measures vary so much by species and by location within the U.S. and because they can be expected to change and potentially be rapidly outdated. The research instead was conducted in a way that requires the advanced expertise of the researcher."}, {"section_title": "Relating Federal Policy to State Policy", "text": "One of the complicating factors in conducting critical assessment of policies, regulations, and agency procedures is their interconnected and often overlapping nature among multiple agencies at three different levels of government (local, state, and federal). For example, the National Marine Fisheries Service has jurisdiction over sea turtles in the water and their aquatic habitats, but when turtles leave the water to nest the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) has jurisdiction. In Florida, the situation is further complicated because the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) has extensive authority under the Florida Constitution. This authority is to \"exercise the regulatory and executive powers of the state with respect to wild animal life and fresh water aquatic life, and shall also exercise regulatory and executive powers of the state with respect to marine life...\" (Article IV, Section 9, Constitution of the State of Florida). The FWC, through Ch. 68A-27, Florida Administrative Code (F.A.C.), has taken the extra step of enacting its own Florida-specific list of Threatened and Endangered species. This list covers some species that are also federally listed, such as Loggerhead sea turtles, which are designated as Threatened by FWC and USWFS. These agencies work cooperatively to manage species covered by rules from both state and federal governments, using a variety of formal and informal procedures to reduce contradictions and redundancies, but those procedures are not always apparent to an analyst and vary in their effectiveness from case to case. Further complicating agency jurisdictions, along the coast the Florida DEP has jurisdiction over sandy beach habitats that fall waterward of a Coastal Construction Control Line (CCCL). The DEP thus has regulatory authority over beaches including beach nourishment, beach vegetation, dredging, and construction. Like the DEP, the USACE has regulatory authority over water, wetlands, and beaches; and designs and constructs its own federally authorized beach nourishment projects. The current study included in its analysis all relevant and overlapping local, state, and federal policies that affect beaches, sea-level rise, nesting sea turtles, beach-nesting birds, and their sandy beach habitats of which the researcher could identify."}, {"section_title": "Permit Review and Analysis", "text": "The Florida DEP is responsible for permitting beach nourishment, dredging, and coastal zone management projects by issuing JCPs. The DEP maintains an online database of JCPs (DEP, 2017). All permits labeled as Final Order as well as all Modifications were downloaded and analyzed for each named project in the subfolders from the \"Current Permits\" and \"Expired Permits\" d for all 28 municipalities within the six target counties. If any of the permits were determined to have expired and been replaced by new permits, the most current permit for each project was analyzed. Expired permits' Final Orders were compared to current permits' Final Orders to determine whether expired projects were assimilated into existing projects, in which case the most current permits were used. Permits were then reviewed for each project using the following categories: most recent year constructed; permittee; whether the project was authorized to be constructed during sea turtle nesting season; volume of sand and length of beach included under the project; whether a dune feature was incorporated in the project; maximum permitted beach berm width; and slope of the beach for the berm, foreshore, and lower slope. Sea turtles' selection of their nest sites is influenced by multiple factors including substrate, beach slope, sand moisture and temperature, width, and sediment characteristics (Lamont & Carthy, 2007;Wood & Bjorndal, 2000). Wood and Bjorndal (2000) found beach slope may be the most important factor. Brock et al (2009) found that slopes of nourished beaches should mirror natural un-nourished beach slopes to improve sea turtle nesting. Steinitz et al. (1998) found that nesting success on is reduced for one to three years on nourished beaches but success increased as nourished and natural beaches became more similar. Consequently, this analysis focused on information regarding permitted beach slope, for which data are readily available from the JCP web site (DEP, 2017). To find these data in permit documents, the researcher reviewed all relevant permit documents, including the final JCPs, Intent to Issue, permit modifications, and permit drawings. Beach slope information was found to be not consistently located in any one section of the permit documents. In various municipalities, slope was described in the project description on the JCP, or in the Intent to Issue document, or (most commonly) on the permit drawings. Review of permits was confounded by variation and inconsistency among permits in aspects such as project titles, date of permit issuance, permit modifications, and consolidation of permits. For the purposes of this research only DEP JCP permits found on the DEP website, not Pending Applications, only Issued Permits and Expired Permits. All permit modifications were reviewed to determine whether a modification had been made to the project length, location, volume, or slope. Expired Permits were reviewed to determine if any were unique or if those projects had received new permits. In the case of a permit that had expired, where a new permit had been issued, the Issued Permit was determined to be the relevant permit. Expired permits were reviewed to determine whether expired permits had been consolidated into a new permit or if the name had changed. The slopes of each project, to the extent they could be determined from the various permitting documents, were compared against those deemed \"turtle friendly\" (PBS&J, 2007). For purposes of this research it is specified that a turtle friendly beach has an upper slope between 1:10 and 1:25; a lower slope between 1:30 and 1:50; and a berm slope between 1:40 and 1:100. It is important to note that the permits were not analyzed to determine whether the permitted slopes were indicative of a natural beach slope at each location. Natural beach slope in an area is a result of many factors including beach orientation, shoreline position, proximity to inlets, local wave climate, and longshore currents. Reviewing these permitted slopes or any beach slope against a turtle friendly slope as defined by PBS&J (2007) may not be appropriate for all beaches, as some beaches may have a natural slope that falls outside of a turtle friendly template but may be a productive sea turtle rookery. There is a wide range of natural beach slopes in the study area, ranging from a very gradual slope, low energy beach at Fort Myers Beach to steeper, higher wave energy environments at Sanibel and Captiva (personal observation). Thus, a determination that a project slope is or is not turtle friendly may not reveal natural beach slope, which is another factor that can influence the extent to which the beach is successfully used by nesting turtles. That factor is beyond the scope of this research. Chapter 4.

Direct habitat and species management is profoundly influenced by policies at the state and national level, in particular those policies that include statutory protection requirements for species (FWC and USFWS). Additionally, beach management activities require permits from the USACOE and DEP, which can inhibit or promote specific conditions that would be effective if implemented at the local level. This section addresses some of the ways in which state and federal permitting, rules, and guidance have governed beach projects, and ways in which the target municipalities' policies and rules interact with those of federal and state agencies to enhance-or inhibit-actions to protect sea turtle habitat. A Florida state agency, the FWC, has statutory authority to protect sea turtles (Ch. 68A-27 F.A.C.) as a species listed on the State of Florida Endangered Species List. \"Take\" is a legal term that relates to harm or harassment of a species. Of special relevance to conservation of nesting sea turtles is language in Ch. 68A-27.001 (4), which defines \"take\" as \"may include significant habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns, including breeding, feeding or sheltering.\" This language is significant when viewed through the prism of FWC roles with regard to commenting on DEP permitting of JCPs which include beach nourishment and other coastal management projects under the authority of DEP. JCP permitting is governed by Ch. 161 F.S. which also includes reference to sea turtles in that \"[t]he department may condition the nature, timing, and sequence of construction of permitted activities to provide protection to nesting sea turtles and hatchlings and their habitat.\" Ch. 161 also has an important provision that allows the DEP to prioritize funding of beach nourishment projects that \"provide enhanced habitat within or adjacent to designated refuges of nesting sea turtles (Ch. 161.101 (14) (h) F.S.).\" This statute recognizes that beach nourishment projects are in the public interest and not only protect properties from erosion, provide storm protection, and provide recreational opportunities, but also increase habitat value for coastal wildlife. The recognition that beach nourishment provides habitat for nesting sea turtles is an important policy statement and reflects the fact that a wider, nourished beach offers far more available nesting habitat than a narrow-eroded beach (Davis et al., 1999). Relocation of sea turtle nests is subject to ESA implementation and is determined by DEP and USFWS permits as these agencies have statutory responsibility for these species. These agencies allow for relocation of sea turtle nests. Projects may be constructed during the sea turtle nesting season on the condition that sea turtle nests in the project area be relocated outside the project area so that nests are not buried with additional sand or impacted by construction activities. Although relocating nests is a common practice for beach nourishment projects that occur during sea turtle nesting season, relocation of sea turtle nests has many risks to hatch rate and ultimate survival of nests. Potential risks to sea turtle nests from relocation include: handling mortality (Limpus et al., 1979); incubation environment impacts (Limpus et al., 1979;Wyneken et. al., 1988); and hatching and emergence success (Limpus et al., 1979, Moody, 1998. Overall, Limpus et al. (1979) found that nests relocated to a beach site outside the project area may experience reduced reproductive success. Moody (1998) found that fewer hatchlings emerge from relocated nests. Rush (2003) found that relocated nests tend to have less hatchlings and may have different incubation times than a nest that has not been relocated. One key factor that is not applied consistently in all parts of the target area is timing The FWC considers nest relocation to be a management technique of last resort due to the potential risk to sea turtle eggs and embryos during nest relocation (FWC, 2016a). Nest relocation, however, has been shown to increase nest development for nests laid below the spring high-tide line (Rush, 2003;Tuttle, 2007) and is common practice if they are laid below the MHWL to prevent nest chamber inundation regardless of beach nourishment activities. Municipalities that conduct coastal management activities can decide to impose more rigorous requirements for relevant federal and state permits than the minimum required by the permitting agencies. This includes timing of beach nourishment projects and determining basic requirements for slope such as not allowing zero slope berms."}, {"section_title": "Scoring Comprehensive Plans and LDCs Regarding Beach-Nesting Birds", "text": "Comprehensive Plans and Land Development Codes were also evaluated for the effectiveness of policies addressing birds ( Table 5). Review of these documents regarding beachnesting birds was complicated by mixed or imprecise terminology. The standard scholarly literature uses the term beach-nesting bird to define all birds that nest on beaches. This includes true shorebirds, such as the Snowy Plover, and seabirds that nest on beaches, such as the Least Tern. Few, if any, of the reviewed Comprehensive Plans used the term \"beach-nesting bird,\" instead using the term \"shorebird\" or \"bird\" when they meant to refer to both true shorebirds and other seabirds that nest on beaches. The current study therefore assumes that when plans refer to shorebirds, they mean to address all beach-nesting birds. Overall, the target municipalities do not have effective plans for protecting beach-nesting birds: 22 of the 28 reviewed plans were scored as 1, the lowest on the scale. Only six mentioned beach-nesting birds somewhere in their Comprehensive Plan and/or LDC and thus received a score of 2 or higher, and only two municipalities scored 3. None of the target municipalities had strong policies regarding beach-nesting birds as none of them scored 4 or 5 out of a maximum 5. One municipality, Charlotte County, included some specific language for project timing requirements and received a score of 3 for limiting construction during the nesting period in \"historic shore-bird nesting areas (CST Policy 1.4.4)\", as well as a requirement that the \"County shall continue to educate the public on\u2026regulations that protect nesting, migratory, seasonal, and resident avian populations (CST Policy 1.4.6).\" The County's coastal and habitat management score, however, was only a 2 because it was not specific about habitat management.

All counties in the study area have had significant proportions of their shoreline nourished. The highest percentage was 98.5% in Manatee County, and the lowest was Sarasota County with 29%. When permits were reviewed to determine the gradient permitted for post-project slope, results showed by far most of the projects did not have turtle friendly slopes. As noted in Section 3.5, a turtle-friendly beach would have an upper slope between 1:10 and 1:25, a lower slope between 1:30 and 1:50, and a berm slope between 1:40 and 1:100. Not one of the 36 nourishment projects in these counties was built with a turtle friendly lower slope, and none of them specified a change in slope between the upper and lower beach. However, 29 out of 35 (83%) projects did have turtle friendly upper slopes ( Table 7). The majority of projects, 26 out of 35 (74%), did not have a turtle friendly berm and defaulted to a flat 0% berm slope. There is sufficient evidence from peer-reviewed literature and monitoring reports to show that beaches constructed with a turtle friendly profile or one that mimics natural beaches will result in higher nesting success of sea turtles (Brock et al., 2009;Crain et al., 1995;Rumbold et al., 2001;Steinitz et al., 1998). These results indicate that the projects in these counties have not been built with sea turtle-friendly nesting habitat requirements.  templates were used, presumably due to differences in natural beach profiles at each beach resulting from bathymetry, shoreline position, and orientation. The spoil from Matanzas Pass was not used in a traditional manner of beach nourishment, but rather was used as a nearshore (underwater) placement. Part of the rationale for this placement was the fact that the spoil from Matanzas Pass was not beach compatible per DEP rules regarding particle size. Placing the sediment offshore instead of on the beach is intended to add sediment to the system and allow natural wave processes to move it onshore (Brutsche and Wang, 2012). Natural processes in the swash zone are expected to sort fine and coarse materials as they are deposited onto the beach over time. All Lee County projects were authorized to be constructed during sea turtle nesting season, and therefore all but one of the projects authorized sea turtle nests to be relocated. The exception was the Matanzas Pass project, which did not involve traditional beach nourishment. A total of 5 of 6 projects had turtle friendly upper slopes, but only 2 of 6 projects utilized a turtle friendly berm.    creating beaches in the County that promote sea turtle nesting.

One requirement is that local agencies conduct surveys for shorebirds and beach-nesting birds. Under permit conditions, DEP requires that the surveys must be conducted by an experienced and trained shorebird monitor who must be approved by FWC using methodology described in the FWC Florida Shorebird Database Breeding Bird Protocol for Shorebirds and Seabirds (FWC, 2016b). Permits also require that surveyors look for flightless chicks in and near the construction zone. locations offer opportunities to observe how SLR will affect coastal processes and coastal habitats as well as how nesting sea turtles and beach-nesting birds will respond to changes over time. Adaptation as practiced in policy by natural resource managers, coastal managers, state and federal governments, and local municipalities will ultimately determine how beach habitats and their dependent species will respond to SLR into the future. As human investments along the coast and the protection of these investments are certain to continue, the future existence and resilience of sandy beaches is inexorably linked to human management and policy of the coast. Because the majority of the coastline in the study area and along much of the United States exists in locations where humans have historically managed or affected management of the coastline, linking management for protection of human investments while managing sandy beach habitats is critical for the survival of these habitats and their dependent species. On an undeveloped coastline, sandy beach habitats will have the ability to adapt to SLR through coastal processes such as barrier island rollback. However, this likely is not a viable option on developed shorelines due to political and economic investment. Therefore, resource managers and policy makers should make a commitment to increase resilience of the coastline to allow sandy beach habitats to persist, and their dependent species thrive."}, {"section_title": "Local Municipalities' Role in Sea-level Rise Policy", "text": "As described, only three municipalities in the study area reference SLR in their Regardless of what SLR scenario is selected, use of a specific policy to implement the scenario into community planning is important in planning for resiliency.

Overall, Florida has maintained or advanced its overall total shoreline due to continual addition of sediments to the beach system via beach nourishment projects (Absalonsen and Dean, 2011). The need for these projects has historically been to maintain wide beaches that support recreation, tourism, and protect upland properties from storms. According to the Florida Strategic Beach Management Plan (DEP, 2018), since at least 1960 beach nourishment projects have placed at least 150 million cubic yards of sand on Florida beaches. Although sea level has risen over the past 100 years, the Florida coastline has not experienced net loss by erosion due to this extensive program (Absalonsen and Dean, 2011). The USACE also plays a significant role in managing, planning, and funding of beach nourishment projects in Florida. In the study area, Captiva Island, Gasparilla Island, Estero Island, Lido Key, Long Key, Sand Key, and Treasure Island are Corps managed projects (http://www.saj.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/Shore-Protection). These projects are all evaluated in the current study, although the names of the projects may be different. For USACE managed projects, planners are required \"to account for the direct and indirect physical and ecological effects of projected future sea-level change on USACE projects and systems of projects, including considerations for adapting to those effects (USACE, 2018).\" This is enacted through the ETL 1100-2-1, Procedures to Evaluate Sea-level Change: Impacts, Responses, and Adaptation. This policy provides procedures and guidance for incorporating relative sea-level rise rates at site-specific locations for the life of projects. Examples of projects include navigation, flood damage reduction, ecosystem projects, and storm damage reduction (e.g. beach nourishment) projects. The USACE has developed a Sea-level Change Curve Calculator using NOAA tide gauge data and compares SLR scenarios with various rates of rise and acceleration that USACE project planners use to evaluate project alternatives. For storm damage reduction projects, incorporation of SLR rates may mean adding more sand volume to the project to maintain the desired berm height and width. Dean and Dalrymple (2002) suggested adjusting projects to increase beach fill to offset longshore sediment transport gradient and sea-level rise. Chu et al. (2014) found that the risk of beach loss for beaches not protected by nourishment increases an average of 3.75% for every year of delay over the next 24 years. The USACE has had a requirement to include future conditions such as SLR in beach nourishment projects since 1986, and, beginning in 2000 at the latest, project managers were required to consider higher sea-level rise rates. As the science of SLR has developed along with an understanding of how SLR affects coastal processes, the USACE has continued to develop projects that incorporate SLR into beach nourishment projects. All projects that are partially or wholly funded by the USACE must consider SLR. As noted previously, many projects evaluated in the study area were USACE-managed projects. The current study was able to find evidence only of adjustments being made to beach volume in DEP permitting documents based upon USACE SLR policy for one project -The Sanibel-Captiva Nourishment Project. It can be assumed that any USACE managed projects in the study area went through the USACE SLR process evaluation. There are several obvious effects of adding volume to beach nourishment projects. Having a higher and wider beach will reduce the return interval for future nourishment events (Dean and Dalrymple 2002). A wider beach will also reduce overwash from storms and increase the overall area of sandy beach habitat. Considering SLR for beach nourishment projects has been a standard USACE practice. All coastal project managers should likewise consider incorporating SLR projections into projects funded by the DEP and local municipalities. This will provide increased storm resilience in the short term and allow resilience and provide long-term habitat quantity and quality as a hedge against the impacts from SLR. As discussed, SLR is a long-term stressor for beaches that is not as readily observed as shorter-term and often more influential impacts such as storm events and local erosion. SLR, however, can and will exacerbate these impacts over time. Even if a project manager does not consider adjusting a project to consider SLR, they typically will consider erosion rates, sediment budgets, storm events, and planning the timing of future events. Adding volume and/or height to a project would lengthen the time between nourishment events. This would increase the cost of the current project, but it would likely reduce the cost over time by lengthening the lifespan of projects. Therefore, project managers should strongly consider investing in a current project with additional volume to save long-term costs that will be incurred at more frequent nourishment intervals."}, {"section_title": "Nesting Sea Turtle Policy", "text": "Policy for nesting sea turtles has not been consistent to provide a holistic approach to habitat management for sea turtles during coastal management. Sandy beaches are required nesting habitat for sea turtles. They are also aesthetically, recreationally, and economically important to humans. As humans continue to manage the coastline, there will be anticipated and unanticipated impacts to nesting sea turtles. Natural resource managers, coastal managers, and policy makers can be highly effective if they work together to achieve a balanced approach to managing the coastline for human and natural communities. Despite state and federal regulations, species and habitat designations, biological opinions, and conservation planning efforts, habitat management for nesting sea turtles continues to be disjunct and ad hoc. This is particularly evident in JCPs reviewed for the current study. Local municipalities may be precluded from developing regulations for listed species under state and federal regulations. Despite this, municipalities have the ability, through revision of Comprehensive Plans and LDCs, to develop criteria based upon the best available science to require that beaches be managed to accommodate nesting sea turtles. Municipalities also have the ability to limit the timing of beach nourishment and coastal management projects, although in practice this is not commonly done because of the consequences to project cost. For municipalities to develop and improve policy to increase habitat value for nesting sea turtles, they should explore revision of policies related to an overall approach to managing beach projects, not only for human use and storm protection, but also to manage and maintain sandy beaches as critical nesting habitat for sea turtles. In Florida, attempts to develop policy for nesting sea turtles have been inconsistently developed, implemented, and managed across local, state and federal governments."}, {"section_title": "Slope for Nesting Sea Turtles", "text": "When a nesting loggerhead sea turtle emerges from the water to nest, she relies on several cues on where to nest. These include lighting, vegetation, elevation of the beach, and especially slope. Natural beaches have changes in slope from the waterline up to the dune. Often, when beaches are nourished, slope considerations are based upon recreational uses and sometimes ease of construction. Many recreational beaches are constructed with a berm (flattest, widest part of the beach) having zero slope. This, however, is not the condition to which turtles have adapted, as natural beaches seldom have a zero-sloped berm. Overall, nourished beaches do not reduce turtle nesting, instead they support it by providing a wider beach that increases the volume of available nesting habitat (Davis et al., 1999). However, numerous studies (e.g., Dickerson, et al., 2007;Rumbold, 2001;Wood and Bjorndal, 2000) have shown impacts to nesting sea turtles in the year or years after nourishment. Of all the known impacts of beach nourishment on nesting sea turtle, including grain size, sand moisture, temperature, salinity, compaction, escapements, etc., the single most important may be slope or beach profile (Brock et al., 2009;Wood & Bjorndal, 2000). Beaches, which are constructed with a large continuous slope as opposed to gradual changing slope, may not cope well with wave energy. Higher, single slope constructed beaches are far more likely to become scarped with large drop-offs, which are difficult for nesting loggerheads to navigate. These beaches also take much longer to reach equilibrium profiles compared to gradual-sloped beaches and lose more sand in the first two to three years after construction. Beaches which mimic natural slopes prevent the formation of escarpments and maintain a beach that is accessible to nesting sea turtles (Parson et al., 2006). If a beach is constructed to mimic a natural beach slope, it will be of higher nesting habitat quality for loggerhead sea turtles. Slopes of nourished beaches should mirror adjacent, nonimpacted beaches. Although Southwest Florida beaches are generally considered to be low energy with gradual slopes compared to Atlantic and Panhandle beaches, local bathymetry and shoreline position can alter the slope. Because of local differences in natural beach profiles, no universal template will work for all nourishment projects (Brock et al., 2009). Beach nourishment projects designed with a zero-slope berm create an elevated, wider, and unnaturally flat beach. A zerosloped berm may confuse nesting females as there is no cue for a transition to dune features where loggerheads typically lay their eggs. Wide, zero-slope berms may cause nesting loggerheads to become disorientated and return to the sea without nesting, which has been noted on Fort Myers Beach (E. Haverfield, pers. comm.). Sea turtles nest closer to the waterline the first few years after nourishment because of the altered, unnatural profile, and their nests are more at risk of being washed out or inundated (Ernest and Martin, 1999). The flat berm also exposes nesting sea turtles and hatchlings to artificial light sources that result in greater disorientation. There have been several efforts by state and federal agencies to evaluate criteria for slope recommendations for beach nourishment projects based upon the best available science and published literature. One of the first of these efforts began in 2003 when the Florida DEP contracted with environmental consultants to identify aspects of beach nourishment projects that impact sea turtles and provide recommendations for project design that would benefit nesting sea turtles (PBS&J, 2007). This study evaluated many factors on a variety of projects in Phase I of what was intended to be a two-phase study. According to the project objectives of the PBS&J study \"the goal \u2026was to determine if statistically significant improvements in nest densities and hatchling production can be achieved through modifications to the traditional construction.\" The study also acknowledged that other factors, such as sediment characteristics and compaction, also impact sea turtle nesting, but those issues are addressed by regulation. The DEP has very specific requirements (Ch. 62B-41.007 F.A.C.) for sand characteristics that require extensive testing to ensure that the sand placed on the beach matches the sand on the native beach, but it does not have requirements for beach slope on beach nourishment projects. PBS&J 2007made several recommendations for slope that would be more favorable for sea turtle nesting success, would reach an equilibrium profile more quickly, and would lose less sand from the construction profile in the process. These revolve around designing a beach nourishment project to mimic a natural beach slope that is equilibrated. Other recommendations include improved physical monitoring, database management, improved reporting methods and integration of physical and biological data for analysis. This approach to mimic natural beach profiles is not new and has been implemented on many projects on the east coast of Florida (Creed et al., 2000). The USFWS SPBO also has recommendations and requirements for high erosion beaches and states \"The beach profile template for the sand placement project shall be designed to mimic the native beach berm elevation and beach slopes landward and seaward of the equilibrated berm crest.\" Those recommendations could be implemented by local agencies, in the absence of state-level or federal-level policies or requirements. The lack of regulations or policies that specifically address beach slope has led to extremely inconsistent application of berm templates and beach construction profiles in DEP permits. This lack of policy direction is likely the primary cause of a lack of turtle friendly beach designs. Another issue may be a lack of coordination and dialogue between biologists and beach planners. Development of standard practices to require beach projects to be built to reflect natural slopes at a minimum would likely increase quantity and quality of nesting habitat for sea turtles in Florida. This can be done through development of new regulation across state and federal levels or through application of standard permitting measures. In the absence of state or federal-level driving forces, the results of the current study show that nearly all projects implemented in the study area are not designed with turtle nesting requirements as core of the project."}, {"section_title": "Beach-Nesting Bird Policy", "text": "As with sea turtle nesting policy, there does not appear to be a consistent connection between coastal management and managing sandy beaches as habitat for beach-nesting birds. In the study area for this research, typical species of birds found nesting on sandy beaches included  (Laakkonen, 2014). However, these communities have not adopted rules or a management plan driven approach for beach-nesting bird conservation. Many JCPs include general and specific conditions requiring bird monitoring during nesting season, protection of nesting areas, and BMPs to protect any potential nesting birds. One recommendation of the IMBNBSAP is that communities develop site specific management plans for these species during beach construction projects. As with beaches for nesting sea turtles, habitat varies by location and can be highly dependent on local conditions and variability in species habitat requirements. Site-specific plans therefore can be very valuable, but most of the permits reviewed do not include such plans with the exception of the previously mentioned Charlotte County Stump Pass project, discussed more in depth below. The site-specific approach for managing beach-nesting birds during the JCP process is a preferred option for increasing nesting success and allows location-based management. This approach would allow for vegetation management, beach slope development, and other BMPs to be implemented.  (Burger and Gochfield, 1990). Species such as Least Terns and Snowy Plovers have evolved to take advantage of overwashed, unvegetated sandy beach habitat in Florida. Convertino et al. (2011) found that Snowy Plover nesting and success was much higher in an area where a strong tropical cyclone impacted a shoreline the previous season. This was likely in response to storm surge-driven waves that scoured the beach and removed vegetation, as well as flattening the beach profile. Koenen et al. (1996) also suggest that long-term management plans for Snowy Plover and Least Terns should consider vegetation control to maintain nesting areas and reduce impact of predators. This kind of assessment is referenced specifically as Action 4 in the IMBNBSAP. Many permitted beach nourishment projects include plantings of salt tolerant beach vegetation, which is important for erosion control and sand retention from aeolian processes. These projects may include vegetation planting as part of the JCP or as part of a separate Coastal Constriction Control Line (CCCL) permitting process. The CCCL is \"intended to define that portion of the beach and dune system which is subject to severe fluctuations caused by a 100-year storm surge, storm waves, or other forces such as wind, wave, or water level changes (Ch. 62B-33.005 F.A.C.).\" This vegetation includes plants such as sea oats, dune sunflower, and other native species. These species are planted using techniques that that lead to high success as well as aggressive growth and spread. They are often planted at ground level or on a constructed, elevated berm. Regardless of how they are planted, they eventually will create an elevated dune. These dunes are very critical as nesting cues and location for sea turtles, and a beach with a dune will have relatively higher sea turtle nesting success than a beach without a dune. Unfortunately, beaches with dunes are not the preferred habitat of many beach-nesting birds such as Snowy Plovers, Least Terns, Black Skimmers, and American Oystercatchers. Therefore, an approach to manage different zones of the beach to meet the different nesting requirements of nesting sea turtles and beachnesting birds would be needed to balance habitat needs of these different species. With the vulnerability of sandy beaches to SLR, species with low populations, such as Snowy Plovers, will be at highest risk of extinction without direct habitat management. Aiello-Lammens et al. (2011) found that, as a result of SLR, the risk of extinction in the next 90 years increases from about 7% to 9% for 1 m of SLR and 11% for 2 m of SLR. If beach nourishment and coastal management projects do not take a proactive approach in responding to anticipated SLR, there is a threat to the continued existence of species such as Snowy Plovers.

Recommendations"}, {"section_title": "Policy Recommendations for SLR Resilience", "text": "As seas continue to rise around the world and especially along the Florida coast, sandy beaches will be among the most vulnerable habitats subjected to its impacts. Sandy beaches face additional inundation and erosion impacts as a result of higher seas. Coastal managers must use established techniques to adapt their management and construction techniques for beach nourishment to SLR if beaches are to maintain resiliency into the future. SLR can be incorporated into coastal management more effectively if it is accounted for at federal, state, and local levels in planning efforts. As the results above demonstrate, effective planning occurs when policy, planning, and regulatory efforts from all three levels of government function together. Substantive changes to policy should require that planners use the best available science of SLR, as demonstrated herein. The projects undertaken by local planners (including those driven by state and federal requirements) in many ways fail to incorporate up-to-date, stateof-the-art scientific knowledge and recommendations. These policy changes should be more than merely guidance tools and should include regulatory requirements that local projects must adhere to and incorporate best available information. Important aspects of this approach are that local planning frameworks should identify and use current rates of SLR as well as projections for their area based upon SLR scenarios and should require that projects be designed and implemented to incorporate SLR rates identified in policy. With the USACE SLR guidance, the federal government has taken the first policy step toward incorporating SLR into coastal management projects. However, this guidance is subject to interpretation, economic considerations, and political decisions. It can also be weighed against \"\u2026human health and safety, economic costs and benefits, environmental impacts, and other social effects.\" The result is that, as with any guidance policy, it is often applied inconsistently and haphazardly. Future estimates are always fraught with uncertainty; however, one thing is certain, sea-levels have and continue to rise based upon the growing body of scientific evidence. Policy should also not allow planners to use a low scenario, as most of these low scenarios (e.g., National Climate Assessment, IPCC) are conservative and are likely to be exceeded at most time horizons. Low scenarios are also in many cases extrapolations of long-term averages of past sea-level rise that do not assume any acceleration. Using the USACE Sea-level Rise Calculator would be a first step towards incorporating scenarios and projections into planning efforts. This Calculator, however, must be kept up-to-date with the most current SLR rates and projections. Local, state, and federal coastal planners should incorporate local and predicted SLR rates into beach nourishment and coastal zone management. In order to effectively ensure that these rates are incorporated, agencies cannot simply rely on guidance policy such as the SPBO or USACE SLR Calculator. These agencies should make changes to their rules, statutes, and ordinances that require planners to use a scientifically defensible process that identifies SLR rates and projections and details how the project will be modified to account for SLR."}, {"section_title": "Policy Recommendations for Nesting Sea Turtles", "text": "As SLR affects nesting sea turtles by impacting sandy beach-nesting habitat, there are a number of habitat management practices that natural resource and coastal managers can incorporate into their projects to increase resiliency for sea turtles nesting on man-made or modified beaches. This research has identified include development of turtle friendly beach slopes that mimic natural slopes when beaches are nourished. understand the importance of nourishment to species survival and to view beach nourishment projects as a tool to help manage populations of nesting sea turtles. Beach nourishment can restore and maintain quantity of sea turtle nesting habitat (Davis et al., 1999). If quality of nesting habitat is seen as one of the drivers in sustaining environmental desirability of the beaches, and if that environmental desirability is seen as one of the drivers in drawing tourists with their significant contributions to the local economy, then viewing these projects as a tool to sustain that cash flow may be more universally accepted. Restoring and maintaining beaches through nourishment should also consider SLR. A beach built to be more resilient to SLR and storm events has the promise of also increasing resilience for sea turtle nests. Hypothetically, a beach built to be higher would withstand higher tides, inundation, and surges than a beach built lower. Conversely, a beach that was not built incorporating current SLR rates and projections into the design would be more likely to be inundated by increased nuisance flooding events. As shown in this study, constructed beach profiles have been very inconsistent from project to project despite permitting by USFWS, DEP and USACE. Development of policy that requires sea turtle friendly slopes is a vital step to properly managing nesting habitat for sea turtles. This is particularly important as nearly 45% of the sandy shoreline in the study area has been nourished, and this figure is likely to increase as SLR results in continued erosion (Zhang et al., 2004). To improve resiliency for sea turtles, natural resource managers and coastal managers should work towards adding volume to make beaches higher and less susceptible to inundation and storm-surge flooding. In order to effectively ensure that these rates are incorporated, agencies cannot rely on guidance policy such as the SPBO or USACE SLR Calculator. These agencies should also make changes to their rules, statutes, and ordinances that require planners to use beach slopes that are turtle friendly or mimic natural shorelines. These nesting requirements can easily be added to areas of beaches where coastal management takes place in order to manage vegetation for these species. Although many beach nourishment projects include plantings as a method to capture sand to build dunes, those plantings change beach elevation and offer cover for predators, thereby decreasing habitat suitability for beach-nesting birds. Using a site-based approach, coastal managers can work with biologists to identify areas where beach-nesting birds occurred historically or where they can create beachnesting bird habitat and incorporate this information into their beach nourishment projects. This approach would require a balance between planting vegetation to create dunes that would benefit nesting sea turtles and designating beach areas for beach-nesting birds."}, {"section_title": "Policy Recommendations for", "text": "The challenge for natural resource managers and coastal managers is to develop policies and management practices to help these species persist. The IMBNBSAP outlines several policy recommendations to enhance beach-nesting bird habitat. These include working with the USACE to implement projects that enhance beach-nesting bird habitat by designing beach-nesting bird habitat requirements and expand implementation of USACE's Migratory Bird Protection Policy. Beach-nesting birds also face risks from SLR, as rising seas will increase flooding risks to beach-nesting bird habitat (Aiello-Lammens et al., 2011). Local coastal managers should also seek to incorporate habitat for beach-nesting birds into current and future projects. This should include identification of historical or high-probability nesting areas, such as active overwash areas, ends of littoral cells, and accreting ends of islands, during development of coastal management projects and developing site-specific management actions to manage these areas. Planning a beach nourishment project with more volume would increase the elevation of the beach to reduce overwash and flooding of beach-nesting bird habitat. This approach would also include mimicking natural beach slope that beach-nesting birds require and designing topography for flat or gently sloping berms. Convertino et al. (2011) found that beach slope should be relatively flat with sparse vegetation to promote nesting habitat for Snowy Plovers. Barrier islands are typically not uniform in natural slope with some areas such as the ends of barrier islands being accretional or erosional which may lead to different slopes on one stretch of shoreline. populations of Snowy Plovers and Least Terns for listing under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The interior population of the Least Tern and the western population of the Snowy Plover are already listed as Endangered under the ESA. The southeastern populations of these species suffer similar threats and loss of habitat as the listed populations. If these species were listed, it would also allow the USFWS to begin rulemaking to identify critical nesting habitat for these species. In the future, this would require beach nourishment projects to not degrade beach-nesting bird habitat at a minimum or to develop proactive management practices that enhance nesting habitat.

Conclusions"}, {"section_title": "Effectiveness of Existing Policies", "text": "The first objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of existing policies using publicly available agency documents, and to identify and evaluate responses to SLR among current coastal management policies and management strategies within the study area of Southwest Florida. \uf0b7 Local municipalities have developed few, if any, policies to deal with SLR. Only two municipalities, Sarasota County and Collier County, specify a value for SLR, but these values are likely too low based on current SLR projections. \uf0b7 Local municipalities have very few policies that address sea turtles, other than sea turtle lighting, and few policies addressing beach-nesting birds. \uf0b7 The state of Florida has no guidance or requirements for SLR. perspective utilizing the SLR rate and projections. However, the application of this policy is not obvious in permits and this policy is more guidance than directive. \uf0b7 State agencies have regulatory policy protecting beach-nesting birds from a listed species perspective, but not necessarily from a permitting standpoint. FWC has excellent narrative policy, such as the Imperiled Beach-Nesting Bird Species Action Plan, that can be utilized to develop regulatory policy. \uf0b7 The IMBNBSAP contains conservation measures that can be incorporated into the JCP process to help provide resilience for these species by increasing the amount of preferred nesting habitat for beach-nesting birds in concert with beach nourishment projects. \uf0b7 Federal agencies have sufficient narrative policies that deal with nesting sea turtles through the SPBO and critical habitat designations. There is not sufficient policy to protect beachnesting birds because they are not federally listed."}, {"section_title": "Extent of Policy Implementation into Management Actions", "text": "The second objective was to determine how policy has been implemented into the management of previously-constructed coastal management projects. This analysis revealed if policy direction was implementation into permitting practices that may be enhancing beach habitat quality and quantity. The lack of regulation or policy that specifically addresses how beaches are constructed with regards to the physical template, such as slope, has led to extremely inconsistent applications of berm templates and beach construction profiles. This is shown clearly in DEP issued JCPs. \uf0b7 Most policies for sea turtles (e.g., SPBO, FMTPA, others) have good narrative policy that is not implemented through the permitting process. For example, Ch. 161.101 (14) (h) F.S. provides DEP funding guidance for beach nourishment projects that \"provide enhanced projects are not designed to provide enhanced habitat as beach profiles are not optimized for nesting sea turtles. This statute reference does not have sufficient detail to deal with habitat quality, but it does minimally address habitat quantity, as a wider beach offers more nesting habitat area that a narrow, eroded beach. \uf0b7 Management of local projects has failed to implement policies that are protective of nesting sea turtles. All projects reviewed did not have turtle friendly slopes or berms. All projects were built without a turtle friendly lower slope, as there was no change in slope between the upper and lower beach. The PBS&J and Ecological Associates, Inc. study makes several recommendations for slope that would be more favorable for sea turtle nesting success, but these recommendations have not been implemented widely or consistently as evidenced by these results. \uf0b7 The IMBNBSAP contains proactive conservation measures and recommendations that can be incorporated into the JCP process, but this does not appear to have been applied in any permits yet. \uf0b7 There does not appear to be a consistent connection between coastal management practices and management of sandy beaches as habitat for beach-nesting birds. A collaborative process between coastal engineers, coastal managers, and biologists can be created to develop beach nourishment projects which meet human and habitat requirements for built beaches. \uf0b7 Federal beach nourishment projects must plan for SLR, but state projects do not have to do so. The USACE requires planners to use SLR rates and projections for all beach nourishment projects. \uf0b7 The Charlotte County Stump Pass project details a nesting habitat management approach to managing a beach specifically for beach-nesting birds-the Charlotte County Stump Pass project. This approach could be applied in other suitable locations along the Southwest Florida coast in concurrence with beach nourishment projects."}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Actions that Can Be Included in Policy and Coastal Management in Southwest Florida", "text": "The third objective was to make recommendations for actions that can be included in policy and coastal management in Southwest Florida to improve resiliency of sandy beach habitats and species that depend upon them, such as beach-nesting birds and sea turtles. These recommendations are supported by the best current understanding of the problem and can serve as valuable management practices for agencies managing sandy beach habitats and the focal species of this study. \uf0b7 Beach nourishment projects can be adjusted to account for current and projected local SLR rates by adding volume and elevating the berm. The USACE's SLR calculator should be adopted by all state and local planners. \uf0b7 To improve resiliency for sea turtles, coastal engineers, natural resource managers, and coastal managers should work together to determine appropriate lower and upper slopes as well as sufficient sand volume to make beaches higher and less susceptible to inundation and storm-surge flooding. A higher beach is less likely to flood during high tides, thus protecting sea turtle nests from inundation. \uf0b7 Regulatory policy should be developed at federal, state, and local levels that prohibits construction templates that use single slope beaches and flat berms. \uf0b7 The USFWS service should conduct a candidate species review for the Southeast populations of Snowy Plovers and Least Terns for listing under the Endangered Species Act to allow the USFWS to begin rule making that would be protective of critical nesting habitat."}]
