[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Introduction: While telomere shortening, a marker of cellular aging, may impact the progression of age-related neurodegenerative diseases, its association with cognition is unclear, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Methods: Telomere, cognitive, and CSF data from 482 participants in the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (148 cognitively normal, 283 mild cognitive impairment, 51 AD) was leveraged to assess telomere length associations with cognition (measured by memory and executive function) and interactions with CSF amyloid-b, tau, and APOE-\u03b54. Secondary analyses assessed brain volume and thickness outcomes. Results: Longer telomeres at baseline were associated with faster executive function decline. Amyloid-b and tau interacted with telomere length on cognition, with longer telomeres related to faster decline among biomarker-positive individuals. Discussion: Telomere associations with cognition shift with AD progression, with longer telomeres related to worse outcomes as pathology increases, highlighting the need for further investigation of telomere length along the AD neuropathological cascade.\nThe authors have declared that no conflict of interest exists. 1 Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc. edu).

Telomeres serve to prevent genomic instability and chromosome fusion and shortened telomere length is unsurprisingly associated with many age-related diseases [3] . For this reason, telomere length has been leveraged in previous work as a marker of biological aging, a process that may be distinct from chronological aging [4] . Since long telomeres protect cells from cellular senescence and death, it is expected that they would also protect neuronal cells from the oxidative stress and neurodegeneration that are part of the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, reports of the role of telomere length in AD risk are mixed. Though some studies have observed no association between telomere length and AD [5, 6] , other studies have found shorter telomeres in participants with AD [7] [8] [9] [10] or other types of dementia [11] compared to cognitively normal participants. In contrast, Thomas et al. [7] observed longer telomere length in the hippocampus of individuals who had AD compared to controls. However, these associations varied by age as well as by the cell type and tissue type in which telomere length was measured even within the same study.\nIn addition to dementia, telomere length has been associated with cognition and AD severity in several studies [8, 12, 13] , although the literature again is not consistent [5, [14] [15] [16] . Interestingly, one study found a nonlinear association between telomere length and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), where both the shortest and longest telomere-length quintiles were associated with increased risk of amnestic MCI [17] . In a separate study, individuals with MCI who progressed to AD had longer telomeres than those with stable MCI [18] . Together, these findings suggest that the association between telomere length and cognition is complex and may change over the clinical course of the disease.\nOur previous work has identified genes involved in telomere maintenance that modify the association between AD biomarkers and downstream neurodegeneration [19, 20] , highlighting a potential pathway of neuroprotection from the consequences of AD pathology. Specifically, in agnostic scans for genetic variants that modify the association between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of amyloid-b (Ab) or tau and neurodegeneration, we identified variants in the protection of telomeres 1 (POT1) gene [20] and the serine palmitoyltransferase long chain base subunit 1 (SPTLC1) gene [19] , which regulate telomerase through ceramide synthesis. These associations suggest that telomeres may be particularly relevant to the neurodegenerative response to AD pathology.\nFew studies investigating telomere length in the context of AD have assessed associations or interactions with biomarkers of AD pathology [10, 18, 21] . To date, two studies have observed no association between telomere length and Ab burden at autopsy or in the CSF [10, 18] . Interestingly, Rolyan et al. [21] found that an AD mouse model with shortened telomeres had reduced Ab pathology and less cognitive impairment compared to AD mice with normal telomeres. More work in larger cohorts assessing interactions between biomarkers of AD neuropathology and telomere length may clarify whether telomere length is relevant to the downstream consequences of neuropathology.\nAdditionally, APOE-\u03b54 allele status, a major risk factor for AD, may contribute to the heterogeneity in the associa-tion between telomeres and cognition. Wikgren et al. [22] observed that nondemented APOE-\u03b54 carriers had longer telomeres and a faster rate of attrition compared to noncarriers. Furthermore, longer telomeres were predictive of worse cognitive performance in those APOE-\u03b54 carriers. The differences in telomere length and rate of shortening between APOE-\u03b54 carriers and noncarriers is one that bears further study, particularly in the context of AD-related outcomes.\nThe goal of this project was to assess the association between baseline leukocyte telomere length and cognitive performance, as well as the interaction between biomarkers of AD neuropathology and leukocyte telomere length on cognitive trajectories. Additionally, we examined telomere associations with and biomarker interactions on brain volume outcomes. The outcome of this work will clarify the degree to which baseline telomere length provides protection or susceptibility to the consequences of AD neuropathology."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Data were acquired from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a longitudinal, multisite study launched as a publicprivate partnership in 2004 led by Principal Investigator Michael W.

For secondary analyses, we restricted the sample to participants with longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging data, dropping the sample size to 440. Informed consent was obtained from all participants or an authorized representative.\nLongitudinal collection of cognitive, imaging, and CSF data began before telomere length measurement. Cognitive or imaging visits more than 180 days before telomere measurement were dropped and the closest visit to telomere measurement was considered baseline for the current analyses.

In interaction models, tau interacted with telomere length on baseline executive function and both Ab and tau interacted with telomere length on change in executive function. In stratified models, longer telomeres were associated with lower baseline executive function among tau-positive individuals and with faster decline in executive function in biomarkerpositive individuals ( Table 3 and Fig. 2) . These associations and interactions passed correction for multiple tests.\nAPOE-\u03b54 allele status also interacted with telomere length significantly to predict executive function trajectories (P 5 .003; see Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 1 ), such that longer telomeres in \u03b54 carriers are associated with faster decline in executive function performance (P 5 .001). Both associations survived correction for multiple comparisons. This association appears to be in a dose-dependent fashion with the effect appearing strongest among \u03b54 homozygotes (see Supplementary Fig. 1 )."}, {"section_title": "Telomere associations with CSF AD biomarkers and brain volumes", "text": "Telomere length was not associated with CSF levels of Ab or tau (P . .13). Additionally, telomere length was not associated with any of the brain volume outcomes, crosssectionally or longitudinally (see Supplementary Table 2 ). However, there was an interaction between Ab and telomere length on medial temporal lobe thickness that approached our corrected threshold for statistical significance (b 5 2 ! 10 26 , standard error 5 1 ! 10 26 , P 5 .005), such that longer telomeres were associated with greater decline in medial temporal lobe thickness among biomarker negative individuals (see Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 2 )."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The present study provides evidence that the downstream associations of longer baseline telomeres on cognition depends, in part, on the presence or absence of neuropathology. Specifically, longer telomeres at baseline were associated with more rapid cognitive decline in the presence of enhanced biomarkers of AD neuropathology. In contrast, longer telomeres among biomarker-negative individuals displayed null or borderline protective associations with downstream brain aging outcomes. Together, these results suggest that longer telomeres at baseline are associated with worse longitudinal outcomes among people with high levels of baseline pathology, but better longitudinal outcomes among people with lower levels of baseline pathology. Such complex interactions may partially explain the heterogeneity in the telomere literature, as telomere associations appear to change over the course of the neuropathological cascade in AD.\nOur primary finding was that longer leukocyte telomeres at baseline were associated with more rapid longitudinal cognitive decline, particularly among individuals with evidence of greater AD pathology. The direction of this association is counterintuitive given that shorter telomeres have previously been linked to cognitive decline in nondemented, aging adults as well as a more severe presentation of AD [8, 12, 31 ]. However, another study observed a similar result whereby longer leukocyte telomeres were associated with increased risk of conversion to MCI and AD [18] . Moreover, Liu et al. [32] found that longer peripheral blood cell telomeres were associated with worse Minimum Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. There are multiple hypothetical mechanisms that may explain the detrimental associations of longer telomeres among biomarker-positive individuals. One possibility is that telomerase (which maintains telomere length) is upregulated in response to AD pathology and drives a slowing of telomere shortening during the preclinical phases of AD. In support of such a possibility, previous work has demonstrated upregulation of telomerase in response to inflammation [33] and immune activation [34, 35] , both of which occur in response to AD pathology [36] . In such a scenario telomerase may be actively elongating and maintaining telomeres in response to the inflammatory cascade in AD. In opposition to this hypothesis, there is also evidence that Ab inhibits telomerase activity [37] , suggesting that an upregulation of telomerase's canonical activity may be unlikely. However, as intracellular Ab may decrease with the development of extracellular plaques [38] , telomerase could potentially be more active as the plaques accumulate."}, {"section_title": "B A", "text": "A second possibility is that this detrimental association reflects an epiphenomenon due to a non-telomere-related upregulation of telomerase components. For example, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, TERT, has been shown to protect against both tau-and amyloid-mediated oxidative stress and apoptosis in cultured neurons [39, 40] . It may be that longer telomeres reflect an enhanced state of TERT activation that is beneficial early in disease, but becomes detrimental as inflammation accelerates. Regardless of the underlying mechanisms, a more comprehensive assessment of how telomere associations change over the course of the neuropathological cascade in AD is needed.\nA comparable interaction was also observed with APOE status, such that longer telomeres in APOE-\u03b54 homozygotes were associated with faster cognitive decline. This corresponds to another study in which longer telomeres were associated with worse episodic memory performance in \u03b54 carriers compared to noncarriers [22] . In contrast, Takata et al. [6] found that APOE-\u03b54 homozygotes with AD had shorter telomeres than heterozygotes and noncarriers, although they did not see an association between telomere length and cognitive decline. The \u03b54 allele has a proinflammatory effect [41] and a strong association with AD pathology [42] , leaving open the possibility that either of the mechanisms discussed above could be driving the APOE interactions observed here.\nIn contrast to the detrimental associations observed among biomarker positive individuals, we observed a beneficial effect of longer telomeres among biomarker individuals, whereby longer telomeres were associated with a slower rate of cortical thinning in the medial temporal cortex. Comparable associations between telomere length and brain volumes have been reported in the past [43] , particularly among nondemented individuals and in subcortical regions of the hippocampus [43] [44] [45] . Since the medial temporal lobe is one of the first to exhibit atrophy in the beginning stages of AD [46] , the current results suggest that longer telomeres may protect against initial decline before substantial pathology has accumulated. Given that we did not see significant associations between telomere length and brain volume outcomes among biomarker positive individuals, it is possible that the telomere interaction on cognition may result from an alternative pathway of injury in AD. Although neurodegeneration is the primary pathway by which AD pathology drives cognitive impairment [47] , there are also alternative pathways such as reductions in cerebral blood flow, white matter degeneration, network connectivity, and glucose metabolism. More studies are needed to truly understand the exact molecular pathways by which longer leukocyte telomeres are associated with worse cognitive outcomes.\nThis study exhibits multiple strengths including the breadth of cognitive, imaging, and genetic data available in the cohort, the detailed measures of telomere length, and the longitudinal data following telomere measurement. However, the study is not without limitations. One limitation of the present study is that telomeres were measured peripherally, which may not reflect telomeric changes in the brain. Lukens et al. [48] found that shortened leukocyte telomere length correlated with cerebellar telomere length in AD patients, but the correlation remains an open question in the field. A second limitation is that the cohort is primarily well-educated, non-Hispanic white individuals, which limits the ability to generalize the findings to other populations. Additionally, we were unable to control for environmental factors like socioeconomic status or lifestyle which may impact telomere length [49, 50] . Finally, the current analyses were underpowered to measure interactions with age or age-stratified models, but that would be an interesting way to assess at what age telomere length is a useful Fig. 3 . APOE-\u03b54 carrier status x telomere length interaction on executive function. Telomere length interacts with APOE-\u03b54 carrier status on change in executive function, such that longer telomeres at baseline are associated with decline in executive function among carriers only. Annual change in executive function is presented on the y-axis, and telomere length on the x-axis. Points and lines are colored by APOE-\u03b54 carrier status, with carriers in red and noncarriers in black. explanatory factor. Larger samples across the spectrum of AD will be needed to fully characterize the complex interactions among age, pathology, and telomeres and how they contribute to cognitive impairment and dementia.\nIn conclusion, this study has described a unique interaction between telomere length and biomarkers of AD neuropathology, suggesting that telomere associations may depend on the neuropathological context in which they are measured. Additional work focusing on the complex interplay between markers of biological aging, chronological aging, and disease may clarify the context in which telomeres are most relevant to AD risk and progression."}]
