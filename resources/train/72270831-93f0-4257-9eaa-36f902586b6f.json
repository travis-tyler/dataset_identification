[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Aim: The number of people with dementia is rapidly increasing as populations around the world age. It is important to grasp the characteristic features of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) for early detection and prevention of dementia.\nWe examined 408 individuals recruited from a health checkup for metabolic syndrome, which comprised three groups: normal (n = 325), MCI (n = 55) and apparent cognitive decline (ACD; n = 28). We compared cognitive/affective functions and exercise/hobby habits with assessments of vascular risk factors and results from computerized touch-panel tests.\nResults: Among the 408 individuals, 93.1% showed normal scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination, and 6.9% had ACD. Among the normal Mini-Mental State Examination participants, 14.5% had MCI (13.5% of all participants). The three groups of participants showed significant differences in age, education, systolic blood pressure, glycosylated hemoglobin and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level. Even within the normal range, those in the MCI group showed significantly lower cognitive function than those in the normal group. Scores on the Geriatric Depression Scale were greater in the MCI group, and \"day-night reversal\" was worse in the ACD group. Scores on touch-panel screening tests were significantly worse in the MCI and ACD groups than in the normal group. Participants showed better cognitive and affective function if they exercised regularly or had hobbies.\nConclusions: Incidental MCI and ACD had prevalences of 13.5% and 6.9%, respectively, in the population-based study. Participants with these conditions showed cognitive/affective decline and impairment on computerized touchpanel tests in relation to vascular risk factors and exercise/hobbies.

In 2010, the number of patients with dementia worldwide was 35.6 million, and this number is estimated to increase to 65.7 million by 2030 and 115.4 million by 2050. 1 Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) are the two leading causes of dementia. Lifestyle-related diseases, such as hypertension (HT), hyperlipidemia (HL), diabetes mellitus (DM) and metabolic syndrome, are the most important vascular risk factors (VRF) for cerebrovascular diseases, and are known to be risk factors for AD. 2 Population-based studies have reported that in addition to medicated hypertension, midlife elevated serum cholesterol, high diastolic blood pressure, older age, the apolipoprotein E4 \u03b54 allele, lower education, depression, cortical atrophy, brain infarcts and white matter hyperintensities are risk factors for cognitive impairment in dementia-free individuals. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Furthermore, our recent study showed that the risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) changing into AD is influenced by low education, low baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, cerebral white matter lesions and parahippocampal gyrus volume. 8 Early detection of MCI and treatment of VRF could lower the risk of those with MCI developing dementias, such as AD and VaD.\nIn the present study, we examined cognitive/affective functions and exercise/hobby habits in a local community population who had a health check for metabolic syndrome. We assessed their VRF and scores on computerized touch-panel tests, and compared the results from normal participants with those from patients with MCI or apparent cognitive decline (ACD).\nAccepted for publication 15 February 2016."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "The medical records of 604 participants who had received a health check for metabolic syndrome carried out by the city government were reviewed, and 408 patients (158 men and 250 women) were selected who were given both the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale 9 and the MMSE in the present cross-sectional study. The average age was 66.2 \u00b1 12.5 years (20s n = 5, 30s n = 10, 40s n = 30, 50s n = 61, 60s n = 102, 70s n = 157, 80s n = 42 and 90s n = 1). Cognitive and affective functions and physical data were examined along with serological tests on the same day (during the morning). The 408 participants were divided into three groups according to the criteria proposed by the Japanese Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (J-ADNI). 8, 10, 11 The three groups were: normal (CDR = 0 and MMSE \u226524, n = 325), MCI (CDR = 0.5 and MMSE \u226524, n = 55) and ACD (MMSE \u226423, n = 28). Clinical data and medical records were analyzed. We checked whether they had exercise habits (at least 3 days a week) and/or hobbies (at least 1 day a week) or not by filling in the interview sheet. In the present study, the kinds and amount of time spent on the exercise and/or hobby did not matter. We excluded those who had already received medical treatment for dementia, or who had any past or present central nervous system disease or psychiatric disorder.\nAll participants gave written informed consent, and the study protocol was approved by the ethics committee on Epidemiological Studies of the Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences (approval #694)."}, {"section_title": "Cognitive and affective functions", "text": "Participants were evaluated with neurological examinations, the CDR, and the following cognitive tests: MMSE, Hasegawa Dementia Score-Revised (HDS-R), Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and a computerized touch-panel test called \"Ryokansan\" (Ohtsu Computer, Otsu, Japan). The Ryokansan program was used according to our previous reports, which included the times (s) to complete the flipping card, finding the mistakes and picture arrangement games, and accuracy (%) on the beat the devils game. [12] [13] [14] The flipping card game assesses the time to find six matching pairs of cards. The finding the mistakes game measures the time to find three mistakes between two similar, but different, picture panels. The picture arrangement game assesses the time to arrange four scenes from a famous Japanese fairy tale in the correct order. The beat the devils game asks participants to distinguish between the emergence of heroes and devils, and assesses accuracy in exterminating only devils during a 30-s period. The flipping the card game reflects recent memory and concentration, the finding the mistakes game reflects the ability to discriminate and attention, the picture arrangement game reflects long-term memory and logical thinking, and the beat the devil game reflects judgment speed and inhibitory control.

Of the 408 participants, 93.1% (n = 380) had normal-ranged MMSE (>23), and 6.9% (n = 28) showed cognitive decline (ACD; \u226423). Among 380 participants with normal MMSE, 85.5% (n = 325, 79.6% of all participants) were considered normal (CDR = 0), and 14.5% (n = 55, 13.5% of all participants) had MCI (CDR = 0.5). Analysis showed significant differences among the three groups in age (normal 64.7 \u00b1 12.7 years vs MCI 69.9 \u00b1 10.4 years and ACD 76.5 \u00b1 7.5 years, P < 0.01), education (normal 12.5 \u00b1 2.3 years vs MCI 11.4 \u00b1 1.6 years, P < 0.05; and ACD 10.1 \u00b1 1.8 years, P < 0.01), systolic blood pressure (normal 130.9 \u00b1 19.2 mmHg vs ACD 142.8 \u00b1 18.5 mmHg, P < 0.05; MCI 130.2 \u00b1 19.7 mmHg vs ACD 142.8 \u00b1 18.5 mmHg, P < 0.05), HbA1c level (normal 5.7 \u00b1 0.7 vs MCI 5.9 \u00b1 0.6, P < 0.01; normal vs ACD 6.1 \u00b1 0.9, P < 0.05) and HDL level (normal 62.1 \u00b1 15.8 vs MCI 56.4 \u00b1 13.3, P < 0.05). There were more underweight individuals (body mass index <18.5) in the ACD and MCI groups than in the normal group, but the difference was not significant. Figure 1a and 1b show the cognitive and affective functions of the three groups (white bars: normal; dotted bars: MCI; gray bars: ACD). Each mean MMSE, HDS-R, FAB and MoCA score in the ACD group (21.6 \u00b1 1.9, 22.8 \u00b1 3.7, 14.4 \u00b1 2.4 and 18.1 \u00b1 5.4, respectively) was significantly lower than what was observed in the normal group (28.5 \u00b1 1.7, 28.6 \u00b1 1.5, 16.3 \u00b1 1.6 and 25.8 \u00b1 2.5, respectively; P < 0.05). Additionally, each mean MMSE, HDS-R and MoCA score in the MCI group (26.8 \u00b1 1.9, 27.3 \u00b1 2.2 and 21.8 \u00b1 3.4, respectively) was significantly lower than the corresponding score in the normal group (P < 0.05; Fig. 1a ). Affective functions also differed in some cases. Mean GDS scores for the MCI group (4.4 \u00b1 4.2) and mean ABS scores for the ACD group (0.7 \u00b1 1.0) were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than the corresponding scores in the normal group (GDS 3.0 \u00b1 3.2, ABS 0.2 \u00b1 0.8). In contrast, AS scores did not differ across groups (Fig. 1b) . In the MCI group, 37.8% were identified as being in a depressive state (GDS: 5-9), and 9.8% showed depression (GDS: 10-15; Fig. 1c ). Apathy (AS: 16 \u00c0 42) was found in 17.9% of the normal group, 36.8% of the MCI group and 26.1% of the ACD group (Fig. 1d) . Mild ABS was found in 33.3% of the ACD group, but in just 6.6% of the normal group, and 17.7% of the MCI group (mild + moderate; Fig. 1e ).\nSubscale analyses of these cognitive tests among the three groups were generally worse in the ACD group than in the MCI or normal groups (Fig. 2a-d ). In contrast, scores on the following MMSE subscales were significantly lower in the MCI group than in the normal group: calculation (normal 4.3 \u00b1 1.2, MCI 3.6 \u00b1 1.6; **P < 0.01), recall (2.7 \u00b1 0.6, 2.3 \u00b1 0.8; **P < 0.01) and sentence repetition (0.9 \u00b1 0.3, 0.7 \u00b1 0.5; **P < 0.01; Fig. 2a) . Similar results were found for HDS-R subscales of calculation (1.9 \u00b1 0.3, 1.7 \u00b1 0.5; **P < 0.01) and recall (5.5 \u00b1 0.9, 5.0 \u00b1 1.4; **P < 0.01; Fig. 2b ), the FAB subscale of forced grasping (3.0 \u00b1 0.2, 2.9 \u00b1 0.6; **P < 0.01; Fig. 2c ) and the MoCA subscales of copy cube (0.9 \u00b1 0.2, 0.7 \u00b1 0.4; **P < 0.01), clock drawing (2.6 \u00b1 0.2, 0.7 \u00b1 0.4; *P < 0.05), read list digits (1.8 \u00b1 0.5, 1.5 \u00b1 0.7; *P < 0.05), subtraction (2.7 \u00b1 0.6, 2.3 \u00b1 0.8; **P < 0.01), repeat (1.2 \u00b1 0.6, 0.8 \u00b1 0.6; **P < 0.01), fluency (0.6 \u00b1 0.5, 0.3 \u00b1 0.5; **P < 0.01), abstraction (2.0 \u00b1 0.1, 1.8 \u00b1 0.5; **P < 0.01) and delayed recall (3.2 \u00b1 1.6, 1.9 \u00b1 1.8; **P < 0.01; Fig. 2d ).\nSubscale analysis of the ABS showed that \"day-night reversal\" scores for the ACD group were significantly higher than for the normal group (normal: 0.04 \u00b1 0.42; ACD: 0.33 \u00b1 0.78; P < 0.05; Fig. 2e ).\nAdditionally, individuals in the MCI and ACD groups took significantly more time to finish the touch-panel tests (Fig. 3, left The MCI (87.3% \u00b1 21.9%) and ACD (73.5% \u00b1 24.0%) groups were less accurate than the normal group (95.6% \u00b1 7.3%) on the beat the devil game (Fig. 3, right) .\nIn the community of the present study, the most common exercise habits was walking (52%), followed by jogging (9%), training gym (9%) and golf (9%). The participants' hobbies were various; gardening (14%), karaoke (11%), handicrafts (8%) and so on. Figure 4a and 4c show that cognitive scores (MMSE, HDS-R and MoCA) were all higher in people who exercised regularly or who had hobbies than in those who did not, and reached significance for HDS-R scores in people with hobbies (hobbies: 28.7 \u00b1 1.3; no hobbies: 26.8 \u00b1 3.2; P < 0.05; Fig. 4c ). The affective scores (GDS, AS and ABS) were all better in people who exercised regularly or who had hobbies than in those who did not (Fig. 4b,d) , and reached significance for GDS in people with hobbies (hobbies: 2.1 \u00b1 2.9; no hobbies: 4.2 \u00b1 3.7, P < 0.05; Fig. 4d )."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The present study examined the cognitive and affective functions of normal participants and those who had MCI and ACD that had received a health check for metabolic syndrome carried out by the city government. Approximately 20% of participants were suspected MCI (13.5%) or ACD (6.9%) in the present study. In 2012, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare estimated that approximately 25% of senior people (aged 65 years or older) had MCI or dementia. The present study shows a slightly lower level of dementia or MCI, because our participants might be more conscious of their health, and their average age was younger (66.2 \u00b1 12.5 years).\nCompared with the normal group, total scores on the MMSE, HDS-R and FAB were significantly worse in the MCI group (Fig. 1a) , and subscale analyses showed declines in \"calculation,\" \"recall,\" \"sentence repetition,\" \"copy cube,\" \"clock drawing test,\" \"read list digits,\" \"letter fluency\" and \"abstraction\" (Fig. 2) , suggesting that people with MCI suffered from impairments in their recent memory, working memory, executive function, attention and constructive apraxia. Additionally, performance on all four touch-panel screening tests was significantly worse in the MCI and ACD groups than in the normal group (Fig. 3) , which was in accordance with our recent study that examined behavioral measures for distinguishing people with MCI from those without. 13 Studies using single-photon emission computed tomography have reported that cerebral blood flow in the temporal, parietal and prefrontal Figure 2 (a-d) Comparison of subscale analysis of cognitive tests among three subgroups: normal (white bars), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; dotted bars) and apparent cognitive decline (ACD; gray bars).

These include no/less social or mental activity, older age, low education, being African American, apolipoprotein E \u03b54 allele, medicated hypertension, midlife elevated serum cholesterol, high diastolic blood pressure, cortical atrophy, brain infarcts and white matter hyperintensities. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and HbA1c level are also associated with cognitive dysfunction and depression, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] perhaps because insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia can promote pathological degeneration related to AD. 24 In the present study, we found significant differences among the three groups in age, education, systolic blood pressure, HbA1c level and HDL level (Table 1) , and these factors are suspected to be risks for dementia. Similar to a previous report (baseline agitation and night-time behaviors), our present study showed a higher \"day-night reversal\" score in the ACD group (Fig. 2E) . 25 Other studies have reported that depression and apathy are associated with cognitive dysfunction, and are additional risk factors for dementia, 3, 4, [26] [27] [28] [29] and exercise habits and hobbies might be important factors for deceleration of cognitive decline. 30 GDS scores for those with MCI and Figure 3 Touch-panel test performance for the three groups: normal (white bars), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; dotted bars) and apparent cognitive decline (ACD; gray bars). The columns show mean value. Note the significant differences between the normal group and the MCI or ACD groups (*P < 0.05). ABS scores for those with ACD were significantly worse than corresponding scores in the normal group (Fig. 1b) . Declines in these affective measures were more frequent in the MCI and ACD groups than in the normal group (Fig. 1c-e) . Furthermore, both of the cognitive and affective scores were all better in people who exercised regularly or who had hobbies than in those who did not, especially in participants who had hobbies, although we did not check the kinds and amount of time spent on hobbies in the present study (Fig. 4 ). There were limitations to the present study; small sample size and selection bias, especially female preponderance, of this study population. There could have been many participants who were highly interested in their health and cognitive functions. Thus, a lager and comprehensive sample is required.\nIn summary, the present study examined cognitive and affective functions in the population who had received a health check for metabolic syndrome. In fact, the participants could be highly conscious about their health and cognitive functions, and we evaluated the cognitive and affective functions based on restricted tests. Regardless of the limitations to the present study, scores on the MMSE showed that 6.9% of the participants had ACD, and even for those with MMSE scores within the normal range, 13.5% of the participants had suspected MCI based on their CDR scores. Characteristics of MCI include cognitive declines in recent memory, working memory, executive function, attention and constructive apraxia, as well as being more depressive, and having day-night reversal, lower exercise habits and fewer hobbies. The present results could be subservient to the early detection of MCI or dementia."}]
