Popular culture and the media perpetuate a 'headless, hungry and unhealthy' stereotype of the overweight individual as weak-willed, susceptible to the temptation of highcalorie foods and prone to ill health. 1 However, it is unclear whether a common biological mechanism underlies predisposition to obesity as well as impulsive behavior and a preference for calorie-dense foods. This question is especially relevant in the context of aging as several adverse health outcomes are associated with obesity in the elderly. [2] [3] [4] We report on the associations between the common obesity risk variant (rs1421085 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)) in the fat mass-and obesity-associated gene, FTO and longitudinal changes in adiposity, brain function, impulsivity and macronutrient intake in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). 5 Figure 1 summarizes the study design. First, we examined whether FTO genotype influenced trajectories of body mass index (BMI) during aging. Second, using serial 15 O-water positron emission tomography (PET), we compared longitudinal changes in resting-state regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), an established marker of neuronal activity, 6 between obesity-related risk allele carriers (FTO+) and noncarriers (FTO \u2212 ). Then, based on differences in the regional pattern of longitudinal changes in rCBF between FTO risk and nonrisk groups, we asked whether FTO genotype influences longitudinal changes in impulsivity and dietary patterns during aging."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS Participants", "text": "The BLSA is a prospective cohort study of community-dwelling volunteer participants in Baltimore, beginning in 1958, and is one of the largest and longest-running longitudinal studies of aging in the United States. 5, 7 The community-dwelling unpaid volunteer participants are predominantly white, of upper-middle socioeconomic status, and with an above-average educational level. In general, at the time of entry into the study, participants had no physical and cognitive impairment and no chronic medical condition with the exception of well-controlled hypertension. Detailed examinations, including neuropsychological assessment and neurological, laboratory and radiological evaluations, were conducted every 2 years. Written informed consent was obtained from participants at each visit, and the study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board and the National Institute on Aging.\nCognitive status was ascertained at consensus diagnosis conferences according to established procedures described previously, 8 using information from neuropsychological tests and clinical data. Diagnoses of dementia and Alzheimer's disease were based on DSM-III-R 9 and the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, 10 respectively. Only participants who remained free of dementia or mild cognitive impairment through the follow-up interval were included in the current analyses. The final study sample consisted of 697 cognitively normal participants (total 7300 visits) with a mean follow-up interval of 23.1 \u00b1 12 years (Table 1 ). All participants in this study sample are Caucasians. Among them, personality measures were available in 692 participants with a mean follow-up period of 10.0 \u00b1 5.8 years while longitudinal dietary records were available in 558 participants (1694 visits) with a mean follow-up interval of 15.9 \u00b1 10.3 years (Supplementary Table 1 ).\nThe Neuroimaging substudy 11 of the BLSA (BLSA-NI), beginning in 1994, includes a subset of BLSA participants who agreed to annual neuroimaging 1 assessment and were free of central nervous system disease (dementia, stroke, bipolar illness, epilepsy), severe cardiac disease (myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease requiring angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery), severe pulmonary disease, or metastatic cancer. The study sample consisted of 69 cognitively normal participants (43 men and 26 women; mean age 69 \u00b1 7.3 years) who completed at least three 15 O-water PET scans between 1994 and 2003 with mean follow-up 8.1 \u00b1 1.1 years and total 560 scans (Supplementary Table 2 )."}, {"section_title": "FTO genotyping", "text": "Several SNPs in the FTO gene have been reported to be associated with obesity traits.

Of the three SNPs in FTO that were first reported to be associated with obesity (rs1421085, rs17817449, rs9939609) and subsequently replicated in several studies, we focused on rs1421085, an obesity-related FTO SNP that has previously been associated with common mental disorders as well as with brain atrophy in non-demented older individuals. 15, 16 In the BLSA, we Figure 1 .

In 15 O-water PET analyses where dominant models were used because of small sample size, participants with one or two obesity-related risk C alleles of rs1421085 were classified as FTO+ whereas those with T/T genotype were classified as FTO \u2212 ."}, {"section_title": "BMI measurement", "text": "Height and weight were measured with calibrated scales by trained technicians at each visit."}, {"section_title": "Covariates used in the FTO genotype and BMI analyses", "text": "Smoking was ascertained by self-report, and participants were categorized as 'nonsmokers,' 'former' or 'current' smokers.

To control for variability in global flow, voxel rCBF values were ratio adjusted to the mean global flow of 50 ml per 100 mg per minute for each image.\nDue to the relatively small number of homozygous risk allele carriers, only dominant (FTO+ versus FTO \u2212 ) models were used in the 15 O-water PET analysis. Voxel-wise differences in longitudinal changes in resting rCBF between groups (FTO+ versus FTO \u2212 ) were examined by group \u00d7 time interaction, adjusting for age at first scan and sex.

In the current analyses, we focused primarily on the impulsivity-related facets of the NEO-PI-R: impulsiveness (N5), excitement-seeking (E5), self-discipline (C5) and deliberation (C6). Raw scores were standardized to T-scores (M = 50, s. d. = 10) using combined-sex norms reported in the NEO-PI-R professional manual by Costa and McCrae. 20 The psychometric properties of NEO-PI-R in the BLSA have been described in detail elsewhere. 17 "}, {"section_title": "Dietary records", "text": "Dietary intakes were assessed by 7-day dietary records collected during four time periods: 1961-1965, 1968-1975, 1984-1991 and 1993-2005 . The details regarding dietary data collection methods have been published previously. 19, 21, 22 Briefly, BLSA participants were trained in the procedure for completing 7-day food records by dietitians. Participants completed the food records at home and sent them to the study center for processing. Before 1993, to assist participants in assessing portion sizes, they were provided food models and a booklet of food pictures. Subsequently, subjects were given a portable scale for weighing food portions. Any questions about ascertained diet records were resolved by contacting participants by telephone.\nMacronutrient consumption was characterized as the average grams of fat, carbohydrate and protein intake across the multiple days of diet records. These values were then converted into calories by multiplying the total grams of each macronutrient by the corresponding number of calories per gram (1 g of fat = 9 calories, 1 g of protein = 4 calories and 1 g of carbohydrate = 4 calories). The percentages of energy derived from fat, carbohydrate and protein intakes were calculated by dividing the calories from that macronutrient by the sum of calories from all three macronutrients (that is, fat, carbohydrate and protein)."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "Exploratory inspection of the relationship between FTO genotype and BMI trajectories showed a nonlinear relationship. To account for repeated measures of BMI and the nonlinear relationship between FTO genotype and BMI changes, the generalized least squares models using gls() function from nlme package in R 23 were implemented. Chronological age was used as the time metric and natural cubic spline (ns() function in splines package) was incorporated to allow flexible modeling of the nonlinear relationship. Autocorrelation of order 1 (AR(1)) was used as the correlation structure between repeated BMI measures and maximum-likelihood estimation was implemented.

Finally, a log-likelihood ratio test was used to test the significance of number of obesity-related risk alleles of FTO \u00d7 age interaction.\nMixed-effects models were used to investigate the association between number of obesity-related risk alleles of FTO and longitudinal changes in impulsivity-related traits and macronutrient intake. The follow-up interval was used as the time metric and included in the model as a random-effects term. Covariates in the impulsivity analysis included age at baseline (centered at 60), sex, age \u00d7 time, sex \u00d7 time and the number of years of education (centered at 16). In the light of a previous study among BLSA participants showing an association between longitudinal changes in BMI and impulsivity, 24 individual slope of BMI change was added in the model to test whether any observed effects of number of obesity-related risk alleles of FTO on longitudinal changes in impulsivity would attenuate. Separate analyses were conducted for the four impulsivity-related traits. Covariates in macronutrient intake analysis included age at baseline (centered at 60), sex, age \u00d7 time, sex \u00d7 time. The year of baseline visit (centered at 1980) was additionally adjusted for in the model to account for potential confounding by secular trends of nutrition intake.

FTO genotype groups were well balanced. Frequencies of genotypes in rs1421085 were T/T in 226 participants (32.4%), C/T in 336 participants (48.2%) and C/C in 135 participants (19.4%; Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), P = 0.61). The frequency of the obesity-related risk (C) allele was 43.5%. Trajectories of BMI over time were significantly different between obesity-risk allele noncarriers, heterozygous and homozygous individuals (likelihood ratio test: \u03c7 2 = 13.7, df = 4, P = 0.008; Figure 2 ). The peak BMI was highest in homozygous carriers, lowest in noncarriers and intermediate in heterozygous individuals. These results were similar in dominant models where FTO+ individuals showed significantly different trajectories of change in BMI as well as a higher peak BMI in comparison with FTO \u2212 participants (data not shown).\nFTO genotype and longitudinal changes in brain function during aging There were no significant differences in demographic characteristics between the FTO+ and FTO \u2212 participants in the 15 O-water PET studies (Supplementary Table 2 ). The FTO+ group showed significantly greater rCBF declines over time relative to the FTO \u2212 group in several brain regions including bilateral anterior cingulate gyri (BA24, BA32), right orbitofrontal gyrus (BA11), right inferior parietal gyrus (BA40), right superior temporal gyrus (BA21), left parahippocampal gyrus (BA35) and right occipital/peristriate region (BA19; Supplementary Table 3 and Figure 3 ). Significantly greater rCBF increments over time in the FTO+ group were found relative to the FTO \u2212 group in a few regions, including the left inferior frontal gyrus (BA45), left middle temporal gyrus (BA21) and right cuneus (BA21).\nIn sensitivity analyses, we confirmed that these results remained unchanged after additional adjustment for concurrent mean BMI, overall cardiovascular risk, APOE \u03b54 status and tissue volume in each of the observed brain regions showing significant differences in longitudinal rCBF changes.\nFTO genotype and longitudinal changes in impulsivity and food intake during aging On the basis of the pattern of greater longitudinal decreases in rCBF in the FTO+ group within bilateral medial prefrontal cortical regions known to be associated with impulse control, we tested whether the FTO genotype would be associated with changes in impulsivity during aging. In general, most measures of impulsivity were found to decrease over time in both groups. These included decreases in 'impulsiveness (N5)' and 'excitement-seeking (E5)' and increments in 'deliberation (C6)' (Supplementary Table 4A ). We observed that the presence of obesity-related risk allele(s) of FTO was associated with attenuation of decline in 'excitementseeking (E5)' behavior (\u03b2 (s.e.) = 0.06 (0.03), t = 2.21, P = 0.027, effect size = 2) after adjustment for baseline age (centered at 60), sex, baseline age \u00d7 time, race, years of education (centered at 16). The largest effect on 'excitement-seeking' was observed in Figure 2 . The effect of FTO genotype (rs1421085 single-nucleotide polymorphism; obesity-risk allele C) on age-and sex-adjusted trajectories of body mass index (BMI) during aging.

These results remained unchanged after adjustment for individual slopes of BMI change over time.\nOn the basis of the pattern of longitudinal decreases in rCBF in FTO+ individuals within the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, brain regions that contain taste neurons sensitive to food-related stimuli, 25, 26 we asked whether the obesity-related risk allele of FTO influenced longitudinal differences in dietary patterns during aging. In general, after adjustment for baseline age (centered at 60), sex, baseline age \u00d7 time, years of baseline visit (centered at 1980), we found that the contribution of fats to total (a) and fat intake (b) during aging from the mixed-effects models. The trajectories were presented at three different baseline age periods: 50-60, 60-70, 70-80 years of age. (a) In general, excitement-seeking decreased as age increased. The presence of obesity-risk alleles was associated with less decrease in excitement-seeking over time in all age periods. (b) Similarly, fat intake decreased during aging. In general, the presence of obesity-risk alleles was associated with less decrease in fat intake over time and at later age periods, 70-80 years of age, homozygous risk alleles carriers even showed increase in fat intake over time.\nenergy intake tended to decrease over time and in contrast, that from carbohydrates increased over time in all participants (Supplementary Table 4B ). However, the presence of obesityrelated risk allele(s) of FTO was associated with attenuation of decline and even increases in fat contribution to energy intake over time at older ages (\u03b2 (s.e.) = 0.06 (0.03), t = 2.41, P = 0.016, effect size = 2; Figure 4b , Supplementary Table S5 ). On the other hand, the FTO+ group showed a trend towards attenuation of the observed increase in carbohydrate contribution to energy intake over time (\u03b2 (s.e.) = \u2212 0.06 (0.03), t = \u2212 1.88, P = 0.06, effect size = 2; Supplementary Figure 1) . Again, these effects were strongest in homozygous individuals, least in noncarriers and intermediate in heterozygous participants. After adjustment for individual slopes of BMI change over time, the results remained similar to the primary analyses.\nFinally, we conducted similar analyses for all outcome variables with another SNP of FTO gene (rs9939609) and all results remained the same (please refer to the Supplementary Material for detailed results)."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Our findings of pleiotropic longitudinal effects of the obesity-gene FTO are perhaps the first such demonstration of its influence on brain function, personality and diet in an older population. Besides showing that its influence on adiposity is persistent during aging, we find that FTO genotype is associated with reduced brain function in the medial prefrontal cortex. We suggest that these reductions in medial prefrontal cortical function mediate both increasing impulsivity as well as a greater preference for dietary fat over time during aging.\nOur findings are especially relevant given that most previous studies on FTO and adiposity have been cross-sectional. Moreover, relatively few studies have been carried out primarily in older individuals. [27] [28] [29] [30] It is estimated that about 35% of adults aged 65 and over in the United States were obese in 2007-2010, representing over eight million adults. 31 It is well known that the obese elderly population incurs higher health care costs and experiences greater disability. 32 The population-attributable risk of obesity due to FTO is estimated to be about 20%. 33 Approximately 16% of individuals of European ancestry are homozygous for obesity-related risk alleles of FTO and are at 67% higher risk for obesity. 34 Our observation of a robust and persistent influence of FTO genotype on longitudinal changes in adiposity in older individuals, therefore, implicates this common genetic variation as a key biological basis of predilection to obesity during aging. It is, however, worth noting in this context that besides genetic influences on trajectories of BMI, environmental factors may have a key role in determining adiposity during aging. 35, 36 The implications of reduced function in the medial prefrontal cortex include increased impulsivity, encompassing behavioral disinhibition, risky decision-making and abnormalities in delaydiscounting. [37] [38] [39] Given our previous observation in the BLSA of a relationship between impulsivity and BMI, 24 as well as our current finding of an effect of FTO genotype on adiposity, we confirmed that this association was independent of changes in BMI. As neurons in the mPFC have also been reported to mediate foodrelated responses evoked by taste, oral texture and olfactory stimuli, 25, 26, 40 our current findings suggest that reduced mPFC function may be a common neural substrate mediating the effects of FTO genotype on both impulsivity and macronutrient intake. Although our findings suggest that reduced mPFC function may be a plausible mechanism underlying FTO-associated changes in impulsivity and diet during aging, these results warrant further confirmation in independent studies. Hess et al. 41 recently reported that the FTO gene regulates midbrain dopaminergic neuronal activity. Moreover, FTO knockout mice show attenuated quinpirole-mediated reduction of locomotion and enhanced sensitivity to both the locomotor and reward stimulatory actions of cocaine. Furthermore, dopaminergic cells in the ventral tegmental area receive direct projections from the mPFC and dopaminergic responses to reward-predicting cues are enhanced by functional inactivation of the mPFC. 42 It is plausible, therefore, that the function of the mPFC, a major target of mesocorticolimbic dopamine neurons, 43 can be modulated by FTO genotype with net effects on reward-seeking behavior.\nIn summary, we have shown that a commonly carried obesityrisk variant of FTO exerts pleiotropic longitudinal effects on several intermediate phenotypes relevant to human health and disease states during aging. Its role in reduced medial prefrontal cortical brain function suggests a common neural mechanism underlying obesity-associated impulsivity and increased consumption of high-calorie foods."}]
