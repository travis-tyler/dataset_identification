[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped, single, and positive-stranded RNA viruses that can be further classified into four genera: alphacoronaviruses, betacoronaviruses, gammacoronaviruses, and deltacoronaviruses 1 . The betacoronaviruses have a zoonotic potential and can be transmitted from animals to humans causing a novel, severe respiratory disease 2 . The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was broken out in 2002, and globally resulted in nearly 8000 laboratory-confirmed cases and 800 deaths 3, 4 . The natural reservoir of SARS-CoV was presumed to be Rhinolophus Sinensis Although the two large-scale epidemics have gradually subsided, the threat from zoonotic betacoronaviruses always exists due to its inherent characteristics (genetic diversity) and frequently contact between humans and animals (hunting and domestication).\nIn December 2019, Wuhan, China, has emerged unknown pneumonia cases with the main symptoms of fever, fatigue, cough, and poor breath . The epidemic has been confirmed to be caused by a novel betacoronaviruses called SARS-CoV-2 9 . Genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 showed a high similarity (~0.96) with bat coronavirus RaTG13, indicating a potential bat origin of the virus 10,11. The COVID-19 is still pandemic, and there were over 15 million confirmed cases and 600,000 deaths worldwide by August, 2020.\nAlthough antiviral drugs and vaccines are under development 12, 13 , the actual work will face many challenges like long-periodic clinical trials and the risk of poor effects caused by high mutation rate. To guide and obtain effective antiviral strategies, it is therefore crucial to study and understand the underlying genetic mechanisms of fitness during infection.\nIn the consensus genome level, SARS-CoV-2 has been reported with limited variations [14] [15] [16] [17] . RNA virus population in a host does not consist of a consensus single haplotype, but rather an ensemble of related sequences termed quasispecies. The dynamic changes of quasispecies affords RNA viruses a greater probability to change their cell tropism or host range or to overcome internal or external selective constraints 18 . The process is likely achieved by changing the genetic characteristics of key functional genes, such as the spike glycoprotein gene 19 . A novel amino mutation D614G within spike protein has currently found to be widely spread in newly infected patients, and its infectious ability reveals 2.6-9.3 times stronger than the early ancestor D 614 haplotype 20-22 . Spike gene could be primarily determined its strong infectious ability of SARS-CoV-2 through binding the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of host cell 23, 24 . Study the quasispecies can not only observe the dynamic fitness of SARS-CoV-2, but also widely discover the potential advantage mutations (like G 614 ) in advance, which were crucial for virus prevention, such as drug design and vaccine development. However, no data have reported its quasispecies yet.\nTherefore, the aim of the study is to investigate the quasispecies features of SARS-CoV-2. We applied PicBio single-molecule real-time (SMRT) technology and circular consensus sequences (CCS) algorithm to obtain quasispecies haplotypes. The included 9 cases and its related 14 samples were carefully prepared to achieve two major research objectives. Firstly, to fully trace the quasispecies features and its dynamics during transmission (between hosts), our cases were screened from two single-source infection sets (containing two familial clusters), and covered first-to third-generation patients. Secondly, to facilitate the discovery of quasispecies differences between sampling types (within host), RNAs were designed to extract from nasopharyngeal swabs (NS), sputum (SP), and stool (ST). Moreover, we have also predicted the potential advantage genotypes and the evolutionary rate at the quasispecies level. Our results provided insight into the genetic fitness of SARS-CoV-2 and also provided important information for the follow-up prevention."}, {"section_title": "Single-molecule real-time sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene", "text": "For all 14 samples ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table1) Table 2 ). Metagenomic sequencing revealed that more than 98% of quasispecies RNA contains the identical designed primer sequences, indicating the amplified segments (subreads and CCS) have no obvious primer bias (Supplementary Fig. 1) . Through increasing the pass number, the main type of sequencing errors within subreads (gaps:\ninsertions and deletions) could be self-corrected during the generation of CCS. Statistics showed that the average gap number of CCS decreases to a low stable value (median: 23, account for 0.60% of full length) when the pass number equaled 5 (Fig. 2a) . Therefore, only CCS with pass \u22655 were considered for further analysis, which accounted for 74.83% (283,655) of the total number and the related subreads accounted for 90.54% of the total sequencing data ( Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 2 )."}, {"section_title": "Evaluation of genetic diversity and evolutionary rate of quasispecies haplotypes", "text": "A total number of 282,866 qualified CCS (99.72%) contained a full length of spike gene, and could be merged into 25,490 quasispecies haplotypes (1,581-3,713; Table 1 ). Compared to an early ancestral strain (Wuhan-Hu-1, Jan 05, 2020; GenBank: MN908947.3), all haplotypes accumulated 8,978 single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and 6,458 amino acid changes. The average genetic distance of quasispecies was ~8.36 \u00d7 10 -4 , while the value of ST samples (9.14 \u00d7 10 -4 ) was greater than that of NS (8.11 \u00d7 10 -4 ) and SP samples (8.13 \u00d7 10 -4 ) (Fig.   3a) . We further observed that the percentage of missense mutations and nonsense mutations in ST samples was also higher than the other two sampling types, where the percentage of missense mutations of ST, NS, and SP was 78.76%, 75.90%, and 75.24%, the percentage of nonsense mutations was 4.59%, 3.53%, and 4.16%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 2 ).\nBased on these mutations, the overall substitution rate of SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes was estimated to be 2.68-3.86 \u00d7 10 -3 per site per year (Fig. 3b) ."}, {"section_title": "Identification of a novel quasispecies structure with the form of 'unique dominant + numerous minors'", "text": "The quasispecies structure of all samples revealed the same style that unique dominant haplotypes with extremely high abundance of 56.02-76.97% (mean: 70.15%) combined with a huge number of minor haplotypes with extremely low abundance of < 5% (mean: < 0.1%) ( Supplementary Fig. 3) . The special quasispecies structure made a low quasispecies complexity that the overall Sn value was 1.35 \u00d7 10 -3 . For details, SP revealed significantly lower than other two sampling types (Chi-square test: p-value = 0.06), where the mean Sn 6 / 28 value is 0.64 \u00d7 10 -3 , 1.59 \u00d7 10 -3 , and 1.82 \u00d7 10 -3 for SP, NS, and ST, respectively (Fig. 3c) .\nTwo single-source groups contained different dominant haplotypes, where FG harbored an SNV 3118G>T and SG showed the same with the reference strain with 3118G ( Table 1) . The principal component analysis showed that the dimension of 3118G>T could be fully classified the samples into two groups and explained more than 98.5% of variances ( Fig. 3d Except for SH, most haplotypes (99.38%) were rare haplotypes (RH) that shared by less than five samples and with extremely low abundance, where 80.16% were singletons. These RH seemed to have no competitive advantage and survive as minor quasispecies in the early samples (mean abundance < 0.1%). However, we cannot ignore the existence of the SH, because it may become a dominant haplotype under certain conditions and cause a pandemic."}, {"section_title": "/ 28", "text": "The RH with mutation of 1841A>G (D614G) was currently prevalent in newly infected patients worldwide (Fig. 5) . The mutation of 1841A>G revealed a high-frequency and was shared by 19 haplotypes, and most of them (18/19) were emerged by self-mutating of dominant haplotype 3118T (Fig. 5) . The epidemic haplotype 1841G (G 614 ) has already existed in early cases of our study, indicating the fitness haplotype may be multi-host origin. Due to high transmission bottleneck, cases obtained new advantage mutations were likely by self-mutating rather than transmission.\nBased on our findings, we proposed a 'One-King' model to reflect the special quasispecies structure of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 6a) , and also inferred the high possibility of multi-host origin of the advantage mutations or haplotypes (Figure 6b ). Finally, we extracted mainly two kinds of potentially fitness mutations within the SH and RH. One was high-abundant mutations on the top 30 abundant haplotuypes and the other was high frequency mutations shared by at least 15 haplotypes, which was separately found 225 and 337 missense mutations in different functional domains (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 )."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Two infection chains with nine first-to third-generation cases made it possible to study the quasispecies and its dynamics during transmission (Fig. 1) . SARS-Cov-2 revealed a special quasispecies composition that one dominant haplotype combined with numerous minor haplotypes. We not only discovered a novel advantage haplotype, but also realized that minor quasispecies were also worthy of attention, especially the minor haplotypes with high-abundant or high-frequent genetic variations. These minor ones may potentially exhibit a strong fitness and grow into the dominant one. However, due to the high transmission bottleneck, source hosts or cases obtained such advantage haplotypes or mutations were likely self-obtained from virus mutations rather than obtained by transmission. Our findings suggested its potential multi-host origin of an epidemic strain. Moreover, we modeled the special quasispecies structure as 'One-King', and it could explain incomprehensible phenomenon at the strain genome level, such as limited cumulative mutations [14] [15] [16] [17] and low evolutionary rate [25] [26] [27] . The current study could deepen our understanding of the underlying genetic mechanism on the fitness changes of SARS-Cov-2.\nHigh-quality haplotype sequences lay the foundation for the subsequent analysis and its interpretation. More than 98% virus genomes contained the identical sequences to the amplified primers, indicating the CCS results have no primer bias (Supplementary Fig. 1) .\nWe obtained an average 27,000 quasispecies sequences for each sample, and the number was more than the SARS-Cov quasispecies study using traditional sanger methods (28 spike sequences from 19 patients) 28 and results from the recent HCV quasispecies study using the same SMRT platform (average 8,130 CCS for each samples with pass > 5) 29 . More than 80,000 cumulative SNVs facilitated us to calculate the evolutionary rate at quasispecies level.\nThe average substitution rate of SARS-Cov-2 was estimated as 2.68-3.86\u00d710 -3 per site per year (Fig. 3b) , which was larger than its recent estimation value of 0.99-1.83\u00d710 -3 at the consensus genome level [25] [26] [27] . Compared with other betacoronaviruses, the evolutionary rate of SARS-Cov-2 was similar to that of SARS-Cov (1.16 -3.30 \u00d710 -3 and 1.67 -4.67\u00d710 -3 for non-synonymous and synonymous mutations, respectively) 30 , but slightly larger than\nWe observed a special quasispecies structure of SARS-Cov-2 that unique dominant haplotypes with abundance of 56.02-76.97% combined with numerous minor haplotypes with mean abundance of < 0.1%, which seemed like 'master + dust' (Supplementary Fig. 3) . The proportion of main quasispecies was much higher than that of SARS-Cov 28 and other RNA virus like HBV and HCV 32, 33 . Two single-source infection groups had different dominant haplotypes, which was consistent with two independent infection chains. The dominant haplotype of SG (V 1040 ) was the same with the strain from early stage of the epidemic.\nHowever, a novel haplotype with F 1040 replaced the V 1040 became the dominant one in FG, while the V 1040 haplotype still existed as minor form (Figs. 4a and b) . All indicated that the dominant haplotype and minor haplotype could be switched under some situations. The same phenomenon was also found in rare haplotypes (RH). The currently epidemic strain 1841G (G 614 ) 21 22 has already existed in our early samples as the minor type (Fig. 5) . Although the novel dominant genotype F 1040 may have changed the structure of spike protein to obtain a fitness advantage (Supplementary Figs. 5-7) , it has not spread as widely as G 614 , which may be due to timely clinical testing and isolation treatment.\nAccording to these findings, we termed and used the 'One-King' model to represent this special quasispecies structure. All quasispecies haplotypes in a host were just like all people in an ancient kingdom. There can only be one king in a kingdom, with extremely great power (Unique dominant haplotype with extremely high abundance). In the kingdom, any capable soldier or normal person had a chance to become the king under some situations (Minor haplotypes with advantage mutations could potentially become the dominant one) (Fig. 6a) .\nThe 'One-King' model could explain some incomprehensible phenomena at strain genome level. The reason why SARS seemed to have only limited cumulative mutations and a small evolutionary rate was because limited dominant haplotypes determined the consensus genome sequences, while ignoring a large amount of minor haplotypes and its mutations.\nOur results observed the possibility that some advantage minor haplotypes becoming the dominant one. However, such minor haplotypes were likely self-obtained from virus rather than from transmission, because the 'One-King' structure was more conducive to the spread of major haplotypes, but likely caused a transmission bottleneck for minor ones. That was why only a small proportion of minor haplotypes (< 6%) could be shared by cases in the same infection chain (Fig. 4) , and also all hosts with dominant haplotype 3118T (F 1040 ) obtained the advantage mutation A1841G (G 614 ) by self-mutated (Fig. 5) . The high likelihood of self-obtained (~0.94) suggested that the dominant haplotype may be of multi-host origin (Fig.   6b) , which was the possible reason why the dominant mutation of D614G appears in different cases with geographical isolation worldwide (Fig. 5) . Although this kind of fitness mutations emerged in minor haplotypes, their frequency was relative high, indicating a selective advantage.\nDue to the special structure and short evolution time, the genetic distance and complexity of SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies revealed greatly low. Nevertheless, quasispecies features could still be showed different between sampling types. Samples from stools had a larger genetic distance and more nonsense mutations and missense mutations than nasopharyngeal swab, and sputum ( Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 2) , indicating stool samples contained relatively more inactive virus. In other aspects, the standard entropy (Sn) of sputum samples was the lowest (Fig. 3c) , indicating its haplotype composition was more dispersed than other two types, and its minor haplotypes may have a larger transmission bottleneck.\nOur study had some limitations. Firstly, due to technical limitations, it was currently difficult to obtain a haplotype with full-length of genome (~29Kb), and the spike gene (~4Kb) may be partially reflected the genome-wide quasispecies information. Secondly, insufficient number of samples made it difficult to observe the dynamics in a relatively large scope such as the intermediate transition state. Thirdly, the current study only focuses on SNVs, and other mutation types such as insertions, deletions, and structural variations need to be further studied.\nThe 'One-King' structure of SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies reflected a novel quasispecies genetic fitness mechanism. Behind the dominant haplotype, there were countless minor fitness haplotypes that could be survived as dominant one in different hosts. Although these haplotypes may be suppressed and unable overcome the transmission bottleneck, the advantage mutations within them could be high-frequently obtained by virus mutations."}, {"section_title": "Future molecular epidemiologic investigations, clinical interventions and vaccine designs", "text": "need to consider the potential advantage SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies and its related mutations, which are missed by routine single concensus genotype 34 (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4) ."}, {"section_title": "Participants in the study", "text": "Nine patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study.
