[{"section_title": "J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f", "text": "The archived RNA samples were used for the library preparation using the COVID Seq assay kit which utilizes the set of 98 primers specific for the SARS-CoV-2 genome (10). The synthesized libraries were sequenced on the MiSeq sequencer (Illumina, Inc) on a 75x2 paired end sequencing recipe. Genomes were assembled using a reference-based approach following a previously published protocol (11) .\nBriefly, quality control of the FASTQ files was performed followed by adapter/base trimming at a Phred quality score of Q30 and length cut-off 70 bps. Reads were aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (NC_045512.\n2) The genomes were assembled at a depth of 12615.92X and 7834.78X, with a genome coverage of 99.84% and 99.70% for the 2 episodes E1 and E2 respectively (Fig.1) . Analysis revealed 14 variants in the genome isolate from E1. 13 out of the 14 variants from E1 were also present in the isolate from E2 while 1 variant 12793G>A was present in E2 with a read count proportion of 35.8%. Of the 14 variants, 6 were non-synonymous.\nPut together, the genomic analysis suggests that the virus isolated from the two episodes were not distinctly different, suggesting reactivation of the virus during the course of chemotherapy. Other possibility is prolonged shedding of the virus in an immune suppressed child. Children tend to shed virus for prolonged period (12) . False-negative results mainly occurred due to inappropriate timing of sample collection in relation to illness onset and deficiency in sampling technique, especially of nasopharyngeal swabs. Specificity of most of the RT-PCR tests is 100% because the primer design is specific to the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (13). To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first cases of SARS-CoV-2 reactivation corroborated by genetic sequence data."}, {"section_title": "COI", "text": "All authors have nothing to declare and will be happy to sign copyright agreement."}, {"section_title": "Disclosure", "text": "J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f "}]
