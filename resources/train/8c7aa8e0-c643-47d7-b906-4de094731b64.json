Here we aimed to compare the performances of ASL derived CBF and 18 F-FDG-PET derived standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) in discriminating patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from older Controls. 2D pseudo continuous ASL and 18 F-FDG-PET data with adequate scan quality from 50 MCI study participants (age=73.0\u00b17.0 years, 16 female) and 35 older controls (age=70.2\u00b16.9 years, 20 female), acquired in close temporal proximity, usually on the same day, were considered for this study. We assessed Control-patient group differences both at voxel level and within a priori regions of interest (ROIs). We also compared their area under receiver operating characteristics curves (AUC) with mean CBF or SUVR in a priori selected posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). CBF and 18 F-FDG-PET showed abnormalities in similar areas, particularly in medial temporoparietal regions, consistent with the typically observed pattern of prodromal AD. The hypoperfusion pattern with relative CBF (obtained by normalizing voxel CBF values with mean CBF in putamen) was more localized than with absolute CBF. Pearson's correlation coefficients between the T-scores corresponding to the group-differences obtained with 18 F-FDG-PET SUVR and absolute and relative ASL CBF were 0.46 and 0.43 (p<0.001), respectively. ROI analyses were also consistent, with the strongest differences observed in PCC (p<0.01). 18 F-FDG-PET SUVR, absolute and relative CBF in the PCC ROI demonstrated moderate and similar discriminatory power in predicting MCI status with AUC of 0.71 \u00b1 0.12, 0.77 \u00b1 0.12 and 0.74 \u00b1 0.13, respectively. In conclusion, ASL CBF may be a reasonable, less expensive and safer substitute for 18 F-FDG-PET in clinical research."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The recent framework for a biomarker definition of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) reflects an increased emphasis on linking the disease to its biological substrate rather than clinical syndrome (Jack et al., 2018; Jack et al., 2016 ). This classification system defines individuals based on the presence of cerebral amyloid (\"A\"), neurofibrillary tau-based pathology (\"T\"), and neurodegeneration (\"N\"). While \"N\" is less specific to the molecular pathology that defines AD, the presence of both A and T (Wirth et al., 2013) , it is critical for staging disease severity, prognostication of clinical endpoints, and disease monitoring. 18 F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography ( 18 F-FDG-PET) is the most mature functional biomarker of neurodegeneration (Herholz et al., 2002; Jack et al., 2013; Landau et al., 2011; Mosconi et al., 2009; Mosconi et al., 2008) . It provides a measure of glucose metabolism and is particularly appealing as it is sensitive to neuronal death and alterations of synaptic activity that are considered to reflect AD pathology (Selkoe, 2002) . Indeed, a number of studies have demonstrated the sensitivity and predictive value of 18 F-FDG-PET measures in preclinical and prodromal stages of AD, termed Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) (Chetelat et al., 2003; Herholz et al., 2011; Landau et al., 2011; Landau et al., 2010; Mosconi et al., 2008) .\nMeasures of cerebral blood flow (CBF) are also thought to reflect synaptic activity based on the tight coupling between synaptic activity and glucose metabolism and between glucose metabolism and CBF (Chen et al., 2011; Raichle, 1998) . Arterial Spin Labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI (Alsop et al., 2015; Detre et al., 1992) provides noninvasive quantification of CBF using magnetically labeled blood as an endogenous flow tracer. ASL-MRI has been extensively validated with other established modalities for measuring CBF (Ewing et al., 2005; Heijtel et al., 2014; Koziak et al., 2008; Warmuth et al., 2007; Ye et al., 2000) and has several advantages over 18 F-FDG-PET in that it does not require exposure to ionizing radiation, is less expensive, and can be acquired as part of routine MRI, which is almost universally obtained in patients with suspected neurodegenerative conditions. We previously demonstrated significant overlap between areas of hypoperfusion measured with ASL-MRI and areas of hypometabolism measured by 18 F-FDG-PET acquired on the same day in mild-to-moderate AD patients in whom these functional changes are more severe and easier to detect than at earlier stages (Chen et al., 2011; Musiek et al., 2012) . The current study aimed to extend the findings to patients with MCI, a clinical diagnosis enriched in patients with prodromal AD. Compared to the previous studies comparing ASL and 18F-FDG-PET in MCI patients (Dolui et al., 2017; Riederer et al., 2018; Tosun et al., 2016) , this study includes a larger sample size and/or superior ASL methodology. The current work also leverages recent advances in the signal processing of 2D ASL-MRI data (Dolui et al., 2016a; Dolui et al., 2016b )."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Participants", "text": "MRI and 18 F-FDG-PET/CT data acquired from 56 MCI patients and 36 older controls, participating in the Penn Memory Center (PMC) cohort, were considered for this study.

ASL data was acquired using pseudo-continuous labeling with a labeling time=1.52s, post labeling delay (PLD)=1.5s and labeling plane offset= 9cm. 45 labelcontrol pairs were acquired with a 2D echo planar imaging (EPI) readout with TR/TE=4s/18ms, matrix size=64x64, in plane resolution=3.4x3.4mm 2 , bandwidth=3004Hz/px, number of slices=18, slice thickness=6mm with a 20% distance factor. T1-weighted image for each subject was acquired using a 3D magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) protocol with TR/TE/TI=1.9s/2.89ms/900ms, flip angle=9 0 , bandwidth=170Hz/px, voxel size=1x1x1mm 3 , 176 slices, and was used for normalizing to the MNI152 template space.\nBoth MRI and PET data were processed using SPM12 (Penny et al., 2007) , FSL (Jenkinson et al., 2012) , Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTS) (Avants et al., 2011) and custom MATLAB scripts. ASL processing included motion correcting the raw EPI time series (Wang, 2012) . To compute absolute CBF (CBF in ml/100g/min), a CBF time series was first obtained by pairwise control-label subtraction, normalizing by corresponding control image, and using a single compartment model with recommended parameters (Alsop et al., 2015) as follows:\nHere \u0394M is the control label difference, \u03bb=0.9ml/g is the blood-brain partition coefficient, \u03c9=1.5s is the PLD, \u03c4=1.52s is the labeling time, \u03b1=0.85 is the tagging efficiency, T 1,blood =1.65s is the T1 of blood, M 0 is the equilibrium magnetization of the brain, and is equal to the corresponding control image. A mean CBF map was obtained using a Structural Correlation with Robust Bayesian (SCRUB) estimation approach to remove artifacts from ASL-CBF images (Dolui et al., 2016a; Dolui et al., 2016b) . The method consisted of an explicit outlier removal stage based on a structural correlation criterion to remove egregious volumes (Dolui et al., 2016a) followed by voxelwise processing to remove local artifacts (Dolui et al., 2016b) . The mean ASL data was coregistered to the T1 image using FSL boundary-based-registration. The T1 images were normalized to the MNI space using ANTs and the CBF maps were normalized to the MNI space by combining the ASL-T1 coregistration and ANTs normalization. Thereafter the CBF maps were partial volume corrected using the method by Johnson and colleagues (Johnson et al., 2005 ) assuming a ratio of 2.5 between gray matter and white matter perfusion. Relative CBF was computed by normalizing the CBF in each voxel by mean CBF in putamen, a gray matter region thought to be unaffected in early AD and, indeed, found to not differ between groups in the current analysis (p>0.05, see results)."}, {"section_title": "18 F-FDG-PET acquisition and processing", "text": "18 F-FDG-PET/CT data from 31 controls and 49 MCI subjects were acquired on a Philips Gemini TF PET/CT scanner on the same day as that of MRI while that from 5 controls and 7 MCI subjects were acquired at an average of 18 (range: -13 to 106) and 15.3 (range: -6 to 97) days from the MRI acquisition. Subjects fasted for at least 4 hours prior to their PET scan, and bloodglucose levels were below 180mg/dl before an intravenous injection of 5.0\u00b10.5 mCi of 18 F-FDG while they rested with their eyes open. Approximately 30 minutes after the injection, a 30-minute 3D emission scan was obtained (six 5-minute frames, 256mm FOV, 128x128 matrix, 2x2x2mm 3 voxel size). The longer acquisition time was required to compensate for the reduced count of the low dose (5mCi) of the tracer used in the study than used in typical clinical scans. Line-ofresponse row-action maximum likelihood algorithm reconstruction using sharp setting was performed followed by CT attenuation correction.\nThe processing of the PET data involved coregistation to the high resolution T1 images using SPM12 with a normalized mutual correlation criterion.

The ROIs were extracted using the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) template (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002) . We also used a composite meta-ROI constructed using the coordinates of the 5 most frequently cited regions (right and left angular gyri, bilateral posterior cingulate, and left middle/inferior temporal gyrus), previously shown sensitive to 18 F-FDG-PET hypometabolism in the AD continuum (Landau et al., 2011) .\nWhole gray matter was used to assess global abnormalities and primary motor cortex was included as a control region.

Hypometabolism was also not observed in hippocampus (p=0.30) though the analysis without PVC showed strong hypometabolism in this region (see supplementary material).

However, data from 12 subjects (7 MCI and 5\nControls) were not acquired on the same day, though acquired less than 4 months apart. A subgroup analysis with only the data obtained on the same day provided very similar effect sizes of the control-MCI group difference for both ASL and PET (data not shown).\nComparison of ASL and 18 F-FDG-PET was performed previously in late (Chen et al., 2011; Fallmar et al., 2017; Musiek et al., 2012; Verfaillie et al., 2015) and early (Verclytte et al., 2016) onset Alzheimer's disease, and demonstrated similar overlap of hypometabolism and hypoperfusion as described here. The current study population was MCI, a group likely enriched in prodromal AD, in whom differences with controls are expected to be subtler than in individuals with dementia. There have been a few prior studies that have examined MCI patients with 18 F-FDG-PET and ASL-MRI (Dolui et al., 2017; Riederer et al., 2018; Tosun et al., 2016) .\nSpecifically, in our prior study (Dolui et al., 2017) , we focused on comparing different ASL modalities using FDG-PET as gold standard with a much smaller sample size. Riederer and colleagues (Riederer et al., 2018) used ASL with poorer pulsed labeling, which is characterized by weaker labeling than PCASL used in the current study and this might lead to their lack of difference in the ASL-MRI perfusion pattern between MCI and controls, unlike in this study.\nThe study by Tosun and colleagues (Tosun et al., 2016) was also conducted using pulsed ASL data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI); further, the ASL and PET data were not acquired in close temporal proximity.\nExamination of the spatial pattern of hypometabolism and hypoperfusion was broadly consistent across modalities and with the prior literature when comparing MCI/AD with cognitively normal adults (Dolui et al., 2017; Johnson et al., 2005; Landau et al., 2011; Mosconi et al., 2008; Riederer et al., 2018; Sierra-Marcos, 2017) . The similarity in regional abnormalities in the MCI population was also evident from high correlation between the T-scores across all voxels.\nInterestingly, several regions in lateral cortical regions in parietal and temporal lobe had similar, but non-overlapping regions of significant group differences. The basis for this discrepancy is uncertain, however blurring, geometric distortion, potential coregistration/normalization inaccuracies and difference in normalization regions may contribute. In addition, other non-AD pathological processes may be present in the heterogeneous construct of MCI, such as cerebrovascular disease, which might also differentially affect perfusion and metabolism and, thus, cause the difference in the abnormality pattern measured by the two imaging modalities.\nThe PCC, which showed the strongest group difference in our study, has been consistently reported to be an early region of hypometabolism with 18 F-FDG-PET in the AD continuum (Drzezga et al., 2003; Herholz et al., 2002; Landau et al., 2012; Minoshima et al., 1997; Mosconi et al., 2009 ) and is perhaps the strongest and most consistent ROI in ASL-MRI studies of AD (Chen et al., 2011; Dai et al., 2009; Dolui et al., 2017; Johnson et al., 2005; Wolk and Detre, 2012; Xekardaki et al., 2015) . Absolute CBF showed higher group difference and discriminatory power than relative CBF, but its global reduction in the diseased cohort and variability even in healthy population makes it relatively non-specific to AD. Relative CBF on the other hand reflected a more AD-specific pattern.\nWhile one might expect partial volume correction (PVC) to have similar effects on both modalities, we found PVC to have less effect on ASL than on PET in that the control-MCI group difference in SUVR was diminished after correction. Notably, from a clinical standpoint, the larger extent of SUVR reduction without PVC in diseased patients might make it easier to visually interpret the scans in neurodegenerative populations. However the AUC values obtained with non-PVC SUVR in a priori selected ROIs were similar to that of ASL.\nThe study has some limitations. First, the postlabeling delay (PLD=1.5s) for this study was shorter than the recently recommended values of 1.8-2s (Alsop et al., 2015) . However, we did not observe transit time artifacts in the mean CBF maps. Further, since the 2D acquisitions occurred slice by slice from the inferior to superior direction, the last slice was acquired 800ms\nafter the first slice leading to an average PLD of approximately 1.9s across the brain, which is more comparable to the recommendations. Use of a 2D acquisition acquired without background suppression may also be considered a limitation relative to current \"state-of-the-art\" ASL, as increased sensitivity to AD using 3D background suppressed ASL was previously demonstrated (Dolui et al., 2017) . Nonetheless, 2D acquisition is more widely available on MRI scanners, and this limitation was mitigated, in part, by the use of advanced signal processing strategies, although we had to discard data from 7 subjects due to poor ASL quality. It is also worth noting that because we did not have molecular measures of amyloid in a significant proportion of the cohort, we cannot comment on the specificity of the findings here to prodromal AD versus other causes of MCI. That said, this issue is equally present for 18 F-FDG-PET and the overlap between the two suggests that these modalities are likely to perform similarly with regard to specificity.\nFinally the study used a different reference region for 18 F-FDG-PET and ASL since we chose to use the optimal reference region for each method in this study.\nIn conclusion, ASL-MRI measurements of CBF produce considerable overlap with measures of 18 F-FDG-SUVR in known regions of early AD neurodegeneration. Given the possibility of adding ASL to routine structural MRI protocols without additional cost or exposure to ionization radiation, it may serve as a useful alternative to 18 "}]
