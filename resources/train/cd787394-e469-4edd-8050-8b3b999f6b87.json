Postmortem studies 1, 2 indicate that an evolution of neuropathologic insults can be observed during the initial stages of AD, with intracellular tau-associated neurofibrillary tangles first appearing in medial temporal and limbic isocortical regions and extracellular amyloid-\u2424 (A\u2424)-associated plaques affecting heteromodal association cortices.\nStructural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows for the detection of macroscopic tissue atrophy associated with AD. Serial imaging helps us view the temporal evolution of the disease process and shows promise for use in assessing drug efficacy. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Most prior longitudinal studies have found that brain atrophy progressively accelerates throughout the disease process, although those studies mostly focus on global measures, such as wholebrain or ventricular volume, 3 or on a single anatomical structure, such as the hippocampus. 5, 10, 12 In this study, we used longitudinal MRI to examine the temporal dynamics of regional cortical and hippocampal atrophy in individuals harboring indicators of AD. Gray matter atrophy, resulting from the loss of neuronal, glial, and neuropil volume, is reflected as diminished cortical thickness in vulnerable regions 15, 16 and decreased volume of the hippocampus. 17 Building on the findings of prior longitudinal clinical, cognitive, and imaging studies 3, 7, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] and a recent theoretical model of the Alzheimer's pathologic cascade, 23 we hypothesized that AD-specific cortical and hippocampal atrophy follows a sigmoidal pattern with initial acceleration followed by deceleration during the later stages of the disease. Our analyses revealed that hippocampal and AD-specific cortical atrophy agree well with the cumulative diffusion model that predicts a sigmoidal pattern.

Underlying this model is the cumulative damage hypothesis, which can be caused by mechanisms such as oxidative stress. 26 According to the cumulative diffusion model, atrophy accelerates initially, and the rate peaks at a point at which half the potential tissue loss has occurred (Figure 1 ). This critical (ie, inflection) point marks a shift in dynamics, namely, before the inflection atrophy is driven by accumulating disease, but in the following period, the rate is constrained by the amount of intact tissue."}, {"section_title": "ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE NEUROIMAGING INITIATIVE DATA", "text": "We examined 317 participants from the public Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://www .adni-info.org), with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples obtained at baseline and 3 T1-weighted MRIs acquired at baseline and at 6 and 12 months of follow-up. We investigated CSF biomarker measurements of A\u24241-42 peptide and total tau (t-tau) according to a recently established CSF signature of AD. 27 These measurements, which we consider to be indirect measures of indicators of AD, show strong promise as preclinical biomarkers that predict future dementia in individuals without dementia.

Also, we used a primary motor and sensory cortex region to serve as a control ROI by averaging the thickness of the precentral and postcentral gyri. 26 Using surface-based registration, 36 we mapped the OASIS-derived ROIs from the surface template onto the Freesurfer-generated results of the individual participants from the ADNI cohort.

We further consider the outcome in which the rate of atrophy has a linear (and not quadratic) association with MMSE score via a negative coefficient (ie, outcome 2) as supportive of the cumulative model because it simply would indicate that the inflection point is beyond the (MMSE) range of the analyzed data. Our assumption is that continuously increasing atrophy rates will slow at some point due to the diminishing amount of intact tissue. All other outcomes will be indicative of an alternative mechanism (ie, alternative outcome). For example, a progressive slowing will suggest an exponential decay pattern.

Yet, baseline hippocampal volume measurements and the annual rates of AD-specific cortical thinning and hippocampal volume loss were statistically indistinguishable from those of healthy controls (P=.17, P =.81, and P =.24, respectively) ( Figure 3) . A correlation analysis that treated CSF biomarkers as continuous variables in the entire CN group (n=92) revealed that mean baseline thickness in AD-vulnerable cortical ROIs was more strongly associated with A\u24241-42 than t-tau, and this association mostly was driven by a subset of the 7 regions, with posterior cingulate and inferior parietal cortices exhibiting the strongest correlations. 26 The mean results agree well with supplemental analyses performed on a small number of CN individuals who progressed to aMCI or AD within 3 years. 26 Furthermore, among the presymptomatic individuals, annual rates of ADspecific cortical thinning and hippocampal volume loss were not correlated with concurrent cognitive decline (ie, MMSE change 3 during the same year; partial correlation P =.57 and P=.63, respectively)."}, {"section_title": "ATROPHY IN SYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS HARBORING INDICATORS OF AD", "text": "Next, we examined the symptomatic individuals (ie, those having aMCI and AD) with an AD-like CSF molecular profile.

In this model, rates of atrophy behave nonlinearly (ie, with a sigmoidal pattern), increasing initially, peaking at the inflection point, and decreasing thereafter. Rates of atrophy in AD-vulnerable cortical ROIs and in the hippocampus in presymptomatic individuals with an AD-like CSF molecular profile were statistically indistinguishable from those of healthy controls. However, the former individuals exhibited an elevated profile, suggesting that these 2 groups can be potentially discriminated with a larger sample size. Of interest, the mean thickness of AD-vulnerable ROIs was significantly reduced in this presymptomatic group, but hippocampal volume was not. This finding suggests that cortical thickness in AD-vulnerable ROIs may be a sensitive biomarker in the earliest stages of the disease process. Longitudinal rates of atrophy in AD-vulnerable cortical and hippocampal regions, however, seem unlikely to be useful for tracking disease progression during the presymptomatic period. These results are further supported by a supplemental analysis of a small number of individuals (n=10) who were CN at baseline but had progressed to aMCI or AD within 3 years of follow-up. Our results from the CN group add to the growing body of literature that demonstrates cortical thickness measurements from select ROIs as sensitive markers of very early AD. [39] [40] [41] This observation does not necessarily contradict the widely accepted pathophysiology of AD that is characterized by early neurofibrillary tangle deposition in the medial temporal lobe (including the hippocampus) and associated atrophy in these regions because volume measurements of a structure as large as the hippocampus may be less sensitive to subtle and localized atrophy than those of ROI-based cortical thickness. Moreover, our analyses suggest that AD-specific cortical thinning in CN individuals is mostly associated with \u2424-amyloid and not tau. The recently demonstrated tight coupling between hippocampal atrophy and episodic memory impairment 42 further suggests that significant volume loss in the hippocampus may be associated with clinical symptoms and therefore is unlikely to occur during a preclinical phase. That is, hippocampal atrophy may mark the transition to cognitive symptoms.\nThickness in AD-vulnerable cortical ROIs and hippocampal volume are significantly reduced during aMCI and clinical AD. Consistent with data from prior studies, [5] [6] [7] [8] 18 rates of AD-specific cortical thinning and hippocampal volume loss also are significantly elevated and correlate with concurrent cognitive decline.\nConsistent with the sigmoidal pattern, the rate of cortical thinning accelerates throughout the presymptomatic and aMCI stages, starting from levels indistinguishable from those of healthy controls and reaching its fastest pace at approximately the MMSE score of 21. Although continuing to progress, AD-specific cortical thinning starts to slow beyond this point. This characterization was consistent across all 7 ADvulnerable cortical ROIs that we examined. Hippocampal atrophy rates, however, exhibit a progressively increasing pattern without a clearly discernible peak before the MMSE score of 15.\nOur longitudinal observation is in broad agreement with a recent cross-sectional characterization of the dynamics of AD biomarkers, 24 in which a sigmoidal pattern of hippocampal atrophy was demonstrated. Building on data from prior serial imaging studies, 7, 14, 18 our results demonstrate that AD-specific brain atrophy is characterized by early acceleration, possibly driven by cumulative insults, such as amyloid toxicity, tangle deposition, and neuronal and synaptic dysfunction, followed by late deceleration, constrained by the diminishing residual intact tissue.\nThe nonlinear, sigmoidal pattern has important implications for clinical trials. First, a linear characterization of brain atrophy can lead to incorrect sample size estimates and underpowered clinical trials. Second, the bell-shaped derivative of the sigmoid implies that early in the disease process, atrophy rates are likely to be indistinguishable from those of controls and therefore probably will be of limited use in tracking progression. Finally, the natural deceleration observed in later disease stages needs to be carefully considered when assessing a disease-modifying therapeutic effect in an AD trial.\nThe present study uses longitudinal neuroimaging data collected from multiple sites and thus demonstrates the potential use of these biomarkers in multicenter clinical trials. Another important aspect of the study is the use of cortical ROIs defined with an independent sample. In contrast with traditional methods that use anatomical landmarks, this approach identifies a disease-specific effect through an exploratory analysis, 39 which yields sensitive markers of disease. To examine the sensitivity of the fit to outliers, we reanalyzed these data without the 2 individuals with extreme data, namely, those with MMSE scores of 16 and 15, respectively. All results remained approximately the same. Crucially, the quadratic term for AD-specific thinning was statistically significant, and the optimum score was approximately 21.\nThe present study has several limitations. One issue involves the use of a cross-sectional design in which cohort effects can confound results. A second concern pertains to the usefulness of a CSF-based cutoff to select participants who have a molecular profile consistent with AD and our assumption that the conditions of these individuals exist on the same disease trajectory. Hence, our findings are contingent on the validity of this hypothetical trajectory. Another limitation involves the examination of longitudinal atrophy during a 1-year period. It is possible that acceleration and deceleration patterns of cortical regions vary substantially across individuals. Furthermore, the limited number of patients in the severe stages of dementia (eg, with an MMSE score \u03fd20) may have biased our computation of where cortical thinning rates peak. As additional longitudinal MRI data during multiyear periods become available, future studies will examine the validity of these findings. Finally, the apparent slowing of AD-specific cortical thinning may not occur due to the underlying biology but may be a consequence of the technical difficulty of resolving thickness changes around and beyond the voxel resolution. Although our characterization of AD-specific cortical thinning as a dynamic biomarker still will be valid, in the interest of understanding the underlying biology of this region, this potential confounder needs to be examined in future work.
