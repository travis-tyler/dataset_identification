The aim of this study was to assess whether easily obtainable measures from structural MRI, combined with demographic data, cognitive data and apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 genotype, can be used to predict amyloid pathology using machine-learning classification. Methods: We examined 810 subjects with structural MRI data and amyloid markers from the European Medical Information Framework for Alzheimer's Disease Multimodal Biomarker Discovery study, including subjects with normal cognition (CN, n = 337, age 66.5 \u00b1 7.2, 50% female, 27% amyloid positive), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 375, age 69. 1 \u00b1 7.5, 53% female, 63% amyloid positive) and AD dementia (n = 98, age 67.0 \u00b1 7.7, 48% female, 97% amyloid positive). Structural MRI scans were visually assessed and Freesurfer was used to obtain subcortical volumes, cortical thickness and surface area measures. We first assessed univariate associations between MRI measures and amyloid pathology using mixed models. Next, we developed and tested an automated classifier using demographic, cognitive, MRI and APOE \u03b54 information to predict amyloid pathology. A support vector machine (SVM) with nested 10-fold cross-validation was applied to identify a set of markers best discriminating between amyloid positive and amyloid negative subjects. Results: In univariate associations, amyloid pathology was associated with lower subcortical volumes and thinner cortex in AD-signature regions in CN and MCI. The multi-variable SVM classifier provided an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.81 \u00b1 0. 07 in MCI and an AUC of 0.74 \u00b1 0.08 in CN. In CN, selected features for the classifier included APOE \u03b54, age, memory scores and several MRI measures such as hippocampus, amygdala and accumbens volumes and cortical thickness in temporal and parahippocampal regions.

As amyloid pathology may arise up to two decades before the onset of dementia, research focus has shifted towards the pre-dementia stage, which provides an opportunity for secondary prevention [2] [3] [4] . The design of clinical trials targeting the amyloid pathway in this early stage would be facilitated by the ability to recruit subjects with amyloid pathology. Amyloid pathology can be assessed in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), obtainable by lumbar puncture, or on positron emission tomography (PET) scans. However, obtaining CSF is relatively invasive and PET scans are costly, invasive by exposing subjects to radiation and are not universally available. As the estimated prevalence of amyloid pathology between the ages of 60 and 80 ranges from 10 to 33% for cognitively normal (CN) subjects and from 37 to 60% for subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [5] , assessing amyloid pathology with CSF or PET for screening purposes is likely inefficient. Finding minimally invasive biomarkers predicting amyloid pathology could reduce the number of invasive, costly and time-consuming measures in clinical trials.\nBrain atrophy markers derived from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could serve as a potential biomarker for amyloid pathology [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . In this study, we evaluate the use of easily obtainable MRI measures for the prediction of amyloid pathology. We included both visual rating scores, which can be easily performed in clinical settings, and quantitative measures of subcortical volumes, cortical thickness and surface area, which can be derived from freely available software and may be more sensitive than visual ratings. We first assessed univariate associations between MRI measures and amyloid pathology. Next, we used support vector machine (SVM) analysis to develop a multi-variable classifier for predicting brain amyloid pathology at a single subject level. Besides imaging measures, we also included other non-invasive measures relevant to AD in the classifier, including demographic information, cognitive testing and apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 genotype."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "We included participants from the European Medical Information Framework for Alzheimer's Disease Multimodal Biomarker Discovery (EMIF-AD MBD) study.

In SVM, two classes are separated by finding a hyperplane that maximizes the margin of separation between data points of each class in a high-dimensional feature space. SVMs are used extensively in neuroimaging as they have been shown to predict outcomes with high accuracy and possess the ability to model diverse and high-dimensional data [32] . We built a classifier to separate amyloid positive from amyloid negative subjects separately in the CN and MCI subgroups and, for the sake of completeness, also in the whole sample (including CN, MCI and AD-dementia patients). To address the imbalance between the number of amyloid positive and amyloid negative subjects in each diagnostic group, we adopted the re-weighting strategy [33] . That means we adjusted weights of each SVM feature inversely proportional to amyloid positive versus negative frequencies.\nMachine-learning approach We used the python Scikitlearn library (version 0.19.1) to perform SVM classification [34] . To prevent overfitting (i.e. the classifier works perfectly on the training data, but is poorly generalizable to new data), we performed feature relevance evaluation and dimensionality reduction using a tree-based feature selection approach with a nested 10-fold cross-validation design [35, 36] . This was performed separately within each subgroup (CN, MCI and whole sample).\nThe nested cross-validation consists of an inner loop for model building and parameter estimation, and an outer loop for model testing. Consequently, the dataset was divided into two parts: a training plus validation subset and a test subset. In the inner loop, SVM models were trained with varying SVM hyper-parameters (i.e. cost parameters C and kernel function) based on a grid search, and a feature selection was performed using classification trees. The validation set was used to determine the SVM hyper-parameters over the grid of possible values. The performance of the resulting model, with optimized SVM hyper-parameters and features, was subsequently evaluated on the test set in the outer loop. For this outer loop, we used a 10-fold cross-validation scheme so that the data were divided into 10 equally sized parts. Nine of these were used as the training/validation set and one as the test set, and the 10 parts were permuted in each iteration of the outer loop so that each one was used for testing once. Finally, the SVM results were averaged over the 10 folds to estimate the predictive power of the proposed model on the whole dataset.\nFeature selection As the input for the classifier, we used demographic information, neuropsychological information, APOE \u03b54 genotype and MRI measures (visual ratings, subcortical volumes, regional cortical thickness and regional surface area measures). To combine information measured on different scales, continuous demographic and MRI measures were normalized to z-scores. In the adopted treebased feature selection strategy, the Gini index was used to measure the relevance of each feature [37] . Features with a Gini index above the mean were kept, others were discarded. The complete list of features considered and selected, in the whole dataset and for CN and MCI separately, is reported in Additional file 1: Table S8 .\nPerformance evaluation To assess the performance of the classifier, we computed the averaged receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC), specificity, sensitivity and accuracy for the testing datasets. We initially maximized the Youden index, and then also explored the results when setting the sensitivity at 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% and 100%. To assess the added value of combining different sources of information, we also built classifiers including only demographic information and a single other biomarker type (neuropsychological tests, APOE \u03b54 genotype, MRI measures).

Using machine-learning techniques, we built a classifier based on a combination of demographic, cognitive, APOE \u03b54 genotype and MRI data that could predict amyloid status at single subject level with a moderate level of accuracy. The performance of the classifier was higher in MCI subjects than in CN subjects. These results are of interest for clinical trial designers who wish to recruit amyloid positive subjects for inclusion. Our results on the association between amyloid pathology and MRI measures in MCI are in line with previous studies that also found more cortical and subcortical atrophy in amyloid positive compared to amyloid negative MCI subjects [6, 7] . In CN, amyloid pathology has previously been associated with cortical atrophy [9] [10] [11] , and lower hippocampal volume in some studies [8, 9] , but not in all [11, 38] . To capture cortical changes associated with AD, two different AD-signature meta-ROIs have been proposed in the literature [10, 31] . In MCI, both AD-signature measures were related to amyloid pathology. In CN, only the AD-signature meta-ROI by Jack et al. [31] was associated with amyloid pathology in our study, suggesting that this one is more sensitive in the early disease stage. We also found an effect of amyloid pathology on nucleus accumbens volume, which was most pronounced in CN subjects. Although nucleus accumbens volumes are not often measured in AD-related studies, it has been hypothesized that this structure could show secondary neurodegeneration in AD in response to reduced input from connections to medial-temporal lobe structures [39] . It should be noted, however, that the nucleus accumbens is a small structure, which is difficult to segment automatically. These results require further validation in future studies.\nThe optimal features selected in the SVM by the tree-based approach included some, but not all, of the variables that showed differences between amyloid positive and amyloid negative subjects in the univariate analyses. Similarly, some of the features selected did not show statistically significant univariate group differences, although for many a trend towards lower values in amyloid positive subjects compared to amyloid negative subjects was observed. By combining the selected features derived from demographic information, neuropsychological examination, MRI measures and APOE \u03b54 genotype, we were able to classify MCI and CN subjects as amyloid positive or negative with a moderate level of accuracy.\nThe AUC for prediction of amyloid pathology was slightly higher in the MCI group compared to the CN group, and in line with a previous study in MCI [40] . In that study, a SVM classifier to predict amyloid pathology in subjects with MCI was also developed. Using cognitive data, hippocampal volume, APOE \u03b54 genotype and peripheral blood protein markers from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, they obtained AUC = 0.80 for predicting amyloid pathology in subjects with MCI. In contrast to a previous study [12] , we did not find that combining MRI markers with APOE \u03b54 genotype improved prediction of amyloid pathology in MCI over only including APOE \u03b54.\nOur results in CN are comparable to the result from a similar study using data from the ADNI and a monocentric cohort [41] . In that study, a machine-learning-based classifier including demographic variables, APOE \u03b54 genotype, cognitive testing and structural MRI data reached an AUC of around 0.6 in CN subjects to predict amyloid positivity. Other studies have used combinations of demographic information, APOE \u03b54 genotype and cognitive testing (without imaging measures) to predict amyloid positivity in CN [42, 43] . They obtained positive predictive values of 0.65 and 0.63 for amyloid positivity, which was a 43-59% increase compared to the baseline prevalence in the cohort (0.41 and 0.44 respectively). In comparison, in our study we obtained a positive predictive value of 0.41 for amyloid pathology in CN, with a baseline prevalence of 0.25 in our cohort, which is a 64% increase in predictive value. To recruit 1000 CN subjects with amyloid pathology, using the classifier could reduce the number of subjects needing to undergo amyloid assessment from 3925 to 2439, which is a 38% decrease. Assuming a cost of \u20ac850 for the pre-screening (including MRI, APOE genotyping and cognitive testing) and \u20ac3500 for an amyloid PET scan, using the classifier for pre-screening could reduce the total screening costs by nearly \u20ac2 million in this CN population. This example is based on an optimized sum of sensitivity and specificity (Youden index). For clinical trial design, it might be more interesting to optimize the sensitivity of the classifier, which would minimize the proportion of falsely excluded amyloid positive subjects, at the cost of the positive predictive value. As can be seen in Table 4 , with increasing sensitivity (and higher negative predictive value), the positive predictive value of the classifier becomes lower, which would lead to increasing costs of pre-screening. We chose SVM as a classification method for several reasons. First, it is based on a robust strategy (i.e. maximum-margin hyper-plane), which is considered to be one of the best to reduce the prediction error in a classification task [44, 45] . Second, only few parameters need to be tuned in order to make it fully operational, making SVM relatively easy to set up and use. Finally, it is particularly well suited for the separation of two classes (in this case, amyloid positive and amyloid negative).\nA strength of our study is that, unlike previous studies [40] [41] [42] , we performed our study in a heterogeneous cohort, in which data acquisition protocols were not standardized and different MR scanners and acquisition parameters were used. In this heterogeneous cohort, we showed a similar predictive accuracy compared to prospective research cohorts, which used standardized data acquisition protocols. This highlights the robustness of our approach and suggests that the results may also be generalizable to other cohorts. This will need to be tested in future studies. Our results may be of interest for studies recruiting subjects from parent cohorts to be included in (secondary) prevention studies targeting anti-amyloid therapeutics [4] . Our findings suggest that for individuals with MCI, screening for amyloid positivity can best be done by age and APOE \u03b54 genotype, with limited added value of MRI. In CN, MRI measures have an added value above the other markers.\nThis study has some limitations. First, we used data acquired at various centres, which had different inclusion criteria for subjects and used different protocols for data collection. However, as already discussed, this also increased generalizability. Second, not everyone had the same measure of amyloid pathology. When possible, we used centralized analysis of the CSF A\u03b2 42/40 ratio to identify amyloid positivity, which has been shown to correlate highly with PET measures of amyloid pathology [46, 47] . For data from one cohort, we only had amyloid PET data available. Although CSF and PET measures are usually in good agreement, some studies have suggested that CSF values might become abnormal earlier than PET [48, 49] . Finally, the same dataset was used to train and test the SVM classifier. Although nested k-fold cross-validation grants good generalizability of the SVM model [36] , studies in independent datasets are needed to further validate our results."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Amyloid pathology is associated with structural MRI changes in AD typical regions in CN subjects and in subjects with MCI.
