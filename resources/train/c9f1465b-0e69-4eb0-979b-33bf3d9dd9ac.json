The PERFORM study is exploring the efficacy of terutroban versus aspirin for secondary prevention in patients with a history of ischemic stroke. We report on the design of an exploratory longitudinal MRI follow-up study that was performed in a subgroup of the PERFORM trial. An international multicentre longitudinal follow-up MRI study was designed for different MR systems employing safety and efficacy readouts: new T2 lesions, new DWI lesions, whole brain volume change, hippocampal volume change, changes in tissue microstructure as depicted by mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy, vessel patency on MR angiography, and the presence of and development of new microbleeds. A total of 1,056 patients (men and women C55 years) were included. The data analysis included 3D reformation, image registration of different contrasts, tissue segmentation, and automated lesion detection. This large international multicentre study demonstrates how new MRI readouts can be used to provide key information on the evolution of cerebral tissue lesions and within the macrovasculature after atherothrombotic stroke in a large sample of patients.\nKeywords MRI \u00c1 Lesion load \u00c1 Brain atrophy \u00c1 Microbleeds \u00c1 PERFORM \u00c1 Longitudinal brain disease progression"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "During the last 20 years, novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have emerged that allow the non-invasive On behalf of the PERFORM Study Investigators.

The MRI is now utilized as the primary imaging modality in major stroke centres to detect and measure cerebral tissue lesions as well as changes in the vascular structure [2] . Moreover, it becomes an accepted feature of clinical trials in a variety of neurological disorders, and particularly in stroke. New MRI markers of cerebrovascular diseases (microbleeds, diffusion) have been recently evaluated offering reliable parameters of assessment of clinical outcome [3, 4] . There are few longitudinal neuro-radiological data assessed in large stroke trials, which mostly are based on the clinical evaluation. In this context the PER-FORM (Prevention of Cerebrovascular and Cardiovascular Events of Ischemic Origin with Terutroban in Patients with a History of Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack) MRI project was designed to depict by MRI structural and functional information on the evolution of cerebral atherothrombotic processes after a recent ischemic stroke. The aim of this major sub study is to provide a longitudinal assessment of multiple MRI parameters in a large subgroup of a post stroke population with a follow-up of 2 years. The rationale and design of the PERFORM study, which includes 19,119 patients randomly allocated either to terutroban, a specific thromboxane prostaglandin (TP) receptor antagonist [5] , 30 mg/day, or to aspirin 100 mg/day, have been described elsewhere, together with the characteristics of the whole population at baseline [6, 7] . Herein we report the design, framework and conduct for this complex international multi-centre longitudinal study. In particular, the MRI methodology chosen and the data that can be obtained in such a large MRI study are presented."}, {"section_title": "Design", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "The patients included in the study were aged C55 years, had a cerebral or retinal infarction in the last 3 months preceding inclusion or TIA in the last 8 days, and were stable at inclusion. They did not have any MRI contraindication such as known risk for exposure to high magnetic fields (e.g., pacemakers, implanted ferromagnetic devices, metallic implants, metal fragments, cochlear implants, brain and spinal cord stimulators), severe claustrophobia and difficulty lying in supine position.

Two MRIs were planned to be performed in each patient included in the study: the first at month 1 (M1), 1-4 months after the qualifying clinical event and the second at month 24 (M24).\nParticipants were fully informed and written consent was obtained according to local regulatory requirements."}, {"section_title": "MRI acquisition", "text": "Before the initiation of the study, a total of 48 MRI sites from 16 countries (11 from Europe, and one each from Australia, Canada, Brazil, Singapore and Taiwan) were selected. MRI scans were performed on 1.5 Tesla scanners in 42 sites and on 3T scanners in six sites.\nThe MRI protocol was implemented at each site following imaging parameter suggestions to ensure standardization across sites and different MRI systems, and to maximize consistency and comparability between data from different manufacturers. Numbers, vendors, models and field strengths of all MRI machines used are listed in Table 1 . Each site was qualified using ACR phantom scans [8] , to monitor image quality, in particular for geometrical distortions and adherence to the study protocol. The phantom scans were to be repeated yearly and after each significant software and hardware upgrade. Ten machines had a major hardware upgrade including system change in six cases, but due to phantom validation we could minimize as much as possible the effect of such changes that affected a relatively small number of patients. All scans included transverse fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), gradient-echo T2*-weighted (T2*-weighted), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) (three directions), 3D time-of-flight (TOF) MR angiography and high-resolution sagittal 3DT1 sequences. For sites with diffusion tensor imaging, transverse DTI (six directions) data were also performed. The total acquisition time was kept reasonably low (from 30 to 45 min, according to the MRI system) to minimize patient's discomfort. Two-dimensional sequences were made of 5-mm thick contiguous slices with a 240 mm FOV and at least a 192 9 256 matrix (128 9 128 X X"}, {"section_title": "MRI examinations", "text": "Aspirin 100"}, {"section_title": "Qualifying event", "text": "Terutroban 30 mg/day Randomization M24 M0 M1 Fig. 1 The trial profile of the PERFORM MRI project for DWI and DTI).

The 3DT1 protocol was chosen to follow ADNI recommendations [9] (1.2-mm thick slices, 240 mm FOV, 192 9 192 matrix), with slight modifications to reduce scan time.\nImage management and reading sessions All scans were centralized by BioClinica and quality was controlled to check for protocol compliance and image quality. In case of significant quality issues, repeat scans were requested. A MRI examination of insufficient quality at M1 excluded the patient from the study. For follow-up timepoints, only image data of sufficient quality were planned to be used for analysis.\nAfter centralization and quality control and before submission to the readers, the image data were processed by the core lab. The aim of the image processing was to prepare the image data for centralized evaluation and to pre-detect the different structures of interest (such as white matter lesions, brain parenchyma, hippocampus) to improve the efficiency and the quality of centralized evaluations. This included various post-processing algorithms, e.g., 3D reformation, image registration, tissue segmentation, automated lesion detection to ensure best possible comparability. After these preparatory steps, image evaluations were carried out under supervision of BioClinica at remote sites on dedicated workstations by independent neuro-radiologists unaware of clinical information using a standardized procedure."}, {"section_title": "MRI assessment", "text": "Focal tissue changes related to the vascular pathology were to be assessed from M1 and M24 on FLAIR (new incidental infarcts and other white matter changes and changes of lesion volume), T2* (microbleeds identified as hypointense lesions) and DWI (incidental acute infarcts at M24). Changes in brain volume occurring between M1 and M24 to assess global brain atrophy and hippocampal were planned to be evaluated on the 3DT1 data set.

Its major advantages over T2 are a better sensitivity for small infarctions close to the sulci and a better differentiation between Virchow-Robin spaces, old lacunes and other white matter lesions [11] . Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) was chosen as known to be very sensitive to detect acute ischemic stroke events [12] .\nHyperintense FLAIR lesions, hypointense FLAIR lesions and hyperintense DWI lesions were pre-detected using an unsupervised 3D segmentation algorithm on FLAIR and DWI isotropic images after skull removal, and manually validated prior to submission to the readers (Fig. 2 )."}, {"section_title": "Brain and hippocampal atrophy", "text": "Brain parenchyma was pre-detected using a 3D segmentation algorithm on 3DT1 images after removal of the skull by 3D deformable registration of a brain atlas, and manually validated prior to submission to the readers (Fig. 3) . Left and right brain volumes were derived from the total brain volume results using the interhemispheric plane as detected at M1 on sagittal 3DT1 images. These surrogate measurements allowed us to measure the impact of brain atrophy with more accuracy on the contra-lateral hemisphere, as the initial infarct and surrounding tissue changes did not affect this measurement. The Jacobian integration, a quantitative technique based on a 3D non-rigid matching of baseline and follow-up MRI examinations [13] was used for the assessment of the longitudinal brain volume changes. As a registration-based technique, it requires less manual interactions with respect to a segmentation-based technique or the boundary shift integral [14, 15] and allows the detection of small brain volume changes [16] .\nThe hippocampal volume was defined as the complex interfolded layers of the cornu ammonis (grey matter), the dentate gyrus (grey matter), the alveus (white matter), the subiculum (grey matter) and the fimbria (white matter). The hippocampal-amygdalar boundary was identified with reference to the temporal horn of the ventricles and, where possible, to the presence of the alveus. Hippocampal Fig. 2 Lesion detection.

The T2* sequence was used for this purpose as it clearly depicts external CSF. Given that the full brain coverage could not be achieved for all patients (24-28 slices of 5 mm were used), the 3DT1 sequence was automatically coregistered to T2* and used to manually complete for potentially missing upper and lower slices, and correct for T2*-related artifacts (Fig. 5) ."}, {"section_title": "Microbleeds", "text": "Cerebral microbleeds [17, 18] were defined as punctuate, homogeneous, rounded, hypointense lesions smaller than 5 mm in size, visualised on T2* sequences.

Symmetrical hypointensities in the globi pallidi (likely to represent calcifications or iron deposition) and flow voids from cortical vessels were also disregarded.\nCerebral microbleeds were also categorized using the following classification: cortical or cortico-subcortical and juxtacortical (\\5 mm from cortex) on one hand, or deep and infratentorial (including brainstem, cerebellum, thalamus, etc.) on the other hand."}, {"section_title": "Brain microstructural tissue changes", "text": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a magnetic resonance imaging technique that measures the directionally dependent rate of water self-diffusion in each image voxel.\nSubcortical white matter ischemic injury causes reductions in the oriented organization of white matter pathways Fig. 4 Hippocampus detection.

For DWI and DTI sequences, the peak, mean, standard deviation and height values were extracted from histogram data. Each DWI and DTI sequence were independently processed by the core lab to suppress the extrameningeal structures and to suppress the CSF voxels in order to restrict the histogram analysis only to the brain parenchyma, and to generate the ADC and FA maps.

In order to ensure the quality of evaluation results throughout the study and among the readers, the inter-and intra-reader reproducibility was monitored based on double reads of 5% of all evaluations. The criteria for acceptable intraand inter-variability rates were related to each type of MRI reading task. A threshold was chosen initially for each task and when the differences between two readers were higher than this threshold the readers were asked to repeat their reads after taking consensual decisions in order to improve reproducibility. When the variability was larger than expected, the concerned case was systematically reviewed and a consensual decision was made.\nThe following criteria for acceptable intra-and interrater variability rates between two double-readings were related to the MRI parameters. For global brain volumes a relative threshold of 1% of variability was accepted. For hippocampal volumes or for intracranial cavity volume, 5% of variability was accepted. For lesion volumes both a relative and an absolute thresholds were used: 5% of variability or an absolute volume variation of less than 300 mm 3 was chosen for hyperintense FLAIR lesions, 3% or 100 mm 3 for hypointense FLAIR lesions, and 3% or 300 mm 3 for hyperintense DWI lesions.
