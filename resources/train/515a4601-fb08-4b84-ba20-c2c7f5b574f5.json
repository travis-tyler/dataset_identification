[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifaceted disease in which cumulative pathological brain insults result in progressive cognitive decline that ultimately leads to dementia. Amyloid plaques, neurofi brillary tangles (NFTs), neurodegeneration, and infl ammation are the wellestablished pathological hallmarks of AD. A plausible model for the development of AD posits that amyloid deposition occurs early in the process but by itself does not directly cause clinical symptoms [1, 2] . Neuronal and synaptic losses appear to be key determinants of cognitive impairment in AD [3, 4] . If neuronal loss leads to cerebral atrophy (as is likely), then it can be expected that cognitive decline and atrophy will be closely associated. On the basis of this evidence, it has been hypothesized that AD pathological cascade is a two-stage process in which amyloidosis and neuronal pathology (tauopathy, neuronal injury, and neurodegeneration) are largely sequential rather than simultaneous processes [1, 5, 6] . Th ere is also suffi cient literature to support the fact that atrophy of the brain structures or neurodegeneration is the most proximate substrate of cognitive impairment in AD [2, [7] [8] [9] . Th is hypothesis of a sequential model was proposed by Jack and colleagues [6] on the basis of biomarker data and is adapted and illustrated in Figure 1 . Owing to the close relationship between neuro degeneration and cognition (as illustrated in Figure 1 ), atrophy measured on structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is a powerful AD biomarker.\nsMRI measures brain morphometry and therefore can capture gray matter atrophy related to the loss of neurons, synapses, and dendritic de-arborization that occurs on a microscopic level in AD; white matter atrophy related to the loss of structural integrity of white matter tracts, presumably resulting from demyelination and dying back of axonal processes; and ex vacuo expansion of cerebrospinal fl uid (CSF) spaces. Since there is a signifi cant negative correlation between NFT density and neuronal counts [10], sMRI indirectly refl ects NFT density. It has been shown that neuronal loss correlates with but exceeds NFT density in AD and is related directly to impaired cognitive function [10] . Neuronal loss also correlates with Braak NFT stage and quantitative NFT burden, validating sMRI as an AD biomarker [11] [12] [13] . Th is review provides a summary of the role of sMRI as an AD biomarker. First, we begin with the most commonly used methods to extract information from sMRI images, then we discuss the diff erent roles in which sMRI can be used as a biomarker in AD, and fi nally we compare the performance of sMRI to that of other major AD biomarkers.\nGiven the large amount of data present in a threedimensional (3D) sMRI scan, several diff erent methods are employed to condense atrophy information in each patient's scan or assess atrophy over multiple scans of the same individual. Th e pattern of neurodegeneration seen using sMRI is similar to the progression of neurofi brillary pathology as described by Braak and Braak [14]. Th e disease usually begins and is ultimately most severe in the medial temporal lobe, particularly the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. Later (that is, when subjects are in the clinical mild cognitive impairment [MCI] phase), the disease spreads to the basal temporal lobe and paralimbic cortical areas such as the posterior cingulate gyrus and precuneus. Th e onset of dementia is due to the spread of degenerative atrophy to multimodal association Abstract Atrophy measured on structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is a powerful biomarker of the stage and intensity of the neurodegenerative aspect of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. In this review, we will discuss the role of sMRI as an AD biomarker by summarizing (a) the most commonly used methods to extract information from sMRI images, (b) the diff erent roles in which sMRI can be used as an AD biomarker, and (c) comparisons of sMRI with other major AD biomarkers."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "biomarker data and is adapted and illustrated in Figure 1 .

However, the disadvantage of using a single region of interest to consolidate 3D information as a disease metric is that it is spatially limited and does not make use of all of the available information in a 3D sMRI."}, {"section_title": "Quantitative voxel-based", "text": "Th ese methods assess atrophy over the entire 3D sMRI scan."}, {"section_title": "3a.

Although VBM enables visualization of the pattern of neurodegeneration due to disease, the statistical testing portion of VBM is designed only to test for group-wise diff erences between two groups of subjects and cannot provide a summary measure for each subject, and this makes it inapplicable to diagnosis in individual subjects."}, {"section_title": "3b.

Th erefore, specifi c techniques have been developed to extract tissue loss information from serial sMRI scans.

BSI determines the total volume through which the surface of the brain has moved between scans acquired at two time points (that is, the brain volume decreases and the volume of the ventricles increases). One of the most sensitive global measures for measuring the rates of brain atrophy is the ventricular change measure using BSI [24] . Th is is because the ventricular boundary on sMRI (T1-weighted images) provides a good contrast for the delineation of the ventricular surface with more accuracy when compared with brain volume and hippocampal volume."}, {"section_title": "Tensor-based morphometry", "text": "Unlike BSI, which analyzes only spatial shift in the brain surfaces, TBM provides a 3D profi le of voxel-level brain degeneration.

Measuring these significant reductions (due to AD) in the medial temporal lobe can be extremely useful for early diagnosis of AD and MCI. At present, diagnostic criteria for AD are based on the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), which are based primarily on clinical and psychometric assessment and do not use quantitative atrophy information available in sMRI scans. However, there is a proposal to add reliable biomarkers to the diagnostic criteria [28] . One of the suggested features is the volume loss of medial temporal structures since measures of sMRI atrophy have accuracies of 70% to 90% in AD and 50% to 70% in amnestic MCI in distinguishing them from age-matched controls [28] . All of the above-mentioned cross-sectional methods, except 3a, can be used as diagnostic metrics for AD and MCI."}, {"section_title": "Predicting the risk of progression in mild cognitive impairment and cognitively normal", "text": "Although there is considerable variability of progression rates in MCI to AD, it has been observed that an average of about 10% to 15% of subjects with MCI, specifi cally of the amnestic type, annually progress to AD [29] . Because pathological changes occur before the onset of clinical symptoms, biomarkers can aid in the prediction of risk of progression in MCI and CN. A recent meta-analysis showed that hippocampal volume can detect an average of approximately 73% of MCI subjects who progress to AD [30] . Several studies using both cross-sectional methods 1 and 2 above have shown that atrophy seen on MRI can predict the risk of progression to AD with good accuracy."}, {"section_title": "Evaluating disease progression", "text": "Charting structural changes in the brain over time is important in monitoring the progression of the disease [31] .

Th ese measures are more sensitive than cross-sectional measures in capturing changes over time since all scans of the same subject are registered together to reduce inter-scan variability."}, {"section_title": "Measuring the effi cacy of therapeutics", "text": "Several investigators have shown that the lower variance in the serial sMRI measurements compared with clinical measures of cognition and function could permit clinical trials to be performed with smaller sample sizes than would be possible using traditional clinical instruments [32] [33] [34] . At present, AD biomarkers have not yet been validated as surrogate endpoints for regulatory purposes and therefore cannot be used as the primary indicators of effi cacy. However, the impact of interventions on these biomarkers has been evaluated in a few trials and was found to be potentially useful in capturing the pharmacodynamic eff ects. Th e effi cacy of donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor, was evaluated using serial sMRI [35, 36] and was found to possibly be neuro-protective in nature since there was some evidence for decreased disease progression on the basis of sMRI trophy. In a diff erent study, it was observed that subjects immunized with A\u03b2 antibody responders had a more rapid volume loss than placebo patients during a phase IIa immunotherapy trial that was prematurely terminated owing to meningoencephalitis in a subset of patients [37] . In addition to evaluating therapeutic effi cacy, atrophy on sMRI can be used to select at-risk MCI subjects for clinical trials.

Also, anti-amyloid trials commonly will exclude subjects with micro-hemorrhages that exceed a specifi ed number. Either long echo time gradient echo or susceptibility-weighted imaging sequences are used for micro-hemorrhage identifi cation. MRI is also used for safety screening during the study. Conditions that are of interest are evidence of new micro-hemorrhage and vasogenic edema.

Several CSF and sMRI studies have compared the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of both and have attempted to characterize the associations between the two biomarkers in the same set of subjects. We have summarized these studies in Table 1 . Th e majority of the studies have concluded that sMRI and CSF provide independent diagnostic information and that the combination provides better discrimination of AD than either one does alone [42] [43] [44] . It has also been shown that both biomarkers are good predictors of MCI progression to AD [45] [46] [47] . However, the associations between both of the biomarkers have not been consistent across studies.

Th is could be due mainly to the fact that measuring the biomarkers in diff erent study populations (that is, at diff erent stages of the disease) will provide diff erent answers, and also there is a large variability in the methodologies used (that is, variability in the assays and sMRI measures ranging from visual assessment to automated diagnosis).\nTh e earlier studies concentrated mainly on the associations between CSF and sMRI biomarkers, whereas the more recent ones have started investigating the association between these biomarkers and cognition. Studies published on the basis of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data have shown that sMRI is more closely related to cognition than CSF biomarkers are [34, 43, 44, 47, 55] , lending support to the model in Figure 1 . As suggested by Wahlund and Blennow [48] , CSF A\u03b2 denotes a specifi c molecular pathway or etiology whereas CSF tau, p-tau, and sMRI may refl ect the disease stage or intensity of AD. However, sMRI appears to be a more stable indicator of neuronal loss in comparison with the CSF measures. Th is may be due to the fact that brain volume quantifi cation with sMRI has nothing analogous to daily turnover of a soluble protein measured using CSF."}, {"section_title": "Structural magnetic resonance imaging and FDG-PET", "text": "Decreased FDG-PET uptake (that is, hypo-metabolism on FDG-PET scans) refl ects metabolic defi cits due to synaptic dysfunction and (probably) tau-mediated neuronal injury. sMRI atrophy is seen mainly in the medial temporal lobes, whereas FDG uptake decreases are seen mainly in the posterior cingulate and parietal lobes. Studies that have investigated FDG and MRI in the same group of subjects are summarized in Table 2 . Several studies have compared FDG and sMRI on the basis of diagnostic and prognostic accuracy in AD. FDG was found to provide slightly better discrimination than MRI in [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] , and a couple of recent studies based on ADNI data found that the two have similar performance [44, 63] and have largely overlapping value for discrimination [44] .

Th e value added to clinical assessment by MRI is that it is an independent non-invasive measure of neuronal loss and thus provides a supplementary measure based only on anatomy; by contrast, clinical diagnosis is done on the basis of clinical examination and neuropsychological tests. Numerous studies now show that sMRI is a stable biomarker of AD progression. Publications on sMRI data from multicenter studies such as ADNI have also provided evidence that the combination of sMRI scans from multicenter studies is possible without much penalty [72] . In addition to being of diagnostic and prognostic value, sMRI can play multiple roles, as described in this review. Th ree future directions still need to be thoroughly investi gated. (a) Th e development of robust, validated, and automated techniques for extracting disease-specifi c information from cross-sectional and serial sMRIs needs to be investigated. (b) Because the majority of the studies discussed here were done on highly screened popula tions, it is important to validate the generalizability of sMRI as a biomarker in clinically based cohorts in which the presence of multiple pathologies and disorders is a norm rather than an exception. (c) How these sMRI measures can be integrated with other clinical measures, CSF, and PET biomarkers to be of clinical use needs to be investigated. "}]
