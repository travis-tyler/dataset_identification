Each copy of the minor A allele at rs26907 (MAF = 0.17), was associated with about 2.6% lower alcohol consumption (Schumann et al., 2011) . Functional analysis of the RASGRF2 gene by the same group revealed that alcohol preference is associated with wholebrain RASGRF2 mRNA expression and that RASGRF2 regulates \u2020 Data used preparating this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.ucla.edu).

It is involved in signal transduction from ion channel receptors (Tian et al., 2004) and the regulation of MAPK signaling cascades, including the ERK pathway (Fasano and Brambilla, 2011; Feig, 2011) , which plays a critical role in drug-induced reinforcement and synaptic plasticity (Girault et al., 2007) . RASGRF2 also helps to regulate neuronal excitability, neuronal survival in response to ischemia, learning and memory formation, and carcinogenesis (Jin and Feig, 2010; Feig, 2011; Fernandez-Medarde and Santos, 2011) .\nA growing enigma in neurology is how alcohol intake, and related genes, affect brain aging. Moderate alcohol intake protects against cardiovascular events (Rimm et al., 1999; Mukamal et al., 2006; Hvidtfeldt et al., 2010) , but it is less clear how moderate"}, {"section_title": "Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience", "text": "www.frontiersin.org drinking affect the brain over the long term. Elderly people who drink moderately may have fewer white matter abnormalities and infarcts than both non-drinkers and heavy drinkers (Mukamal et al., 2001; den Heijer et al., 2004; Mukamal, 2004) . Genetic factors affect alcohol intake (Olfson and Bierut, 2012; Blaine et al., 2013; Meyers et al., 2013 ) but we do not know if the same genes affect brain structure and the rate of brain atrophy. Dynamic changes in the brain's lateral ventricles reveal the rate of brain atrophy as we age and reflect brain tissue loss with high effect sizes . Lateral ventricle expansion accompanies gray and white matter degeneration globally and in nearby subcortical regions (Ferrarini et al., 2008) . The ventricles do not play a role in cognition, but ventricular expansion is associated with many brain-related health factors in the elderly, including current cognitive status and future memory decline (Coffey et al., 2001) .\nHere, we hypothesized that this candidate variant for reduced drinking (the minor A allele at the rs26907 locus in RASGRF2) might be associated with structural differences in fronto-limbic regions relevant to alcohol reinforcement in elderly subjects. To test if the findings generalized, we examined an independent replication sample of elderly participants, reducing the risk of false positive findings. We predicted that this variant might be associated with the ventricular expansion rate, in the larger sample whose ventricular volumes were measured at baseline, and at 1-and 2-year follow ups."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "SUBJECTS", "text": "Data used in preparing this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database 1 . ADNI, followed by ADNI-GO and ADNI-2, recruited over 1500 adults, ages 55-90, to participate in the research, consisting of cognitively normal older individuals, people with early or late mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Subjects originally recruited for ADNI-1 and ADNI-GO had the option to be followed in ADNI-2. For up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.org.\nHere, we analyzed two independent samples of elderly subjects with neuroimaging and genome-wide data from the ADNI1 and ADNI2 cohorts. We refer to ADNI-GO and ADNI-2 participants as \"ADNI2,\" as the only distinction was the grant funding that supported data collection, and the data collection was identical for them both.

Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before protocol-specific procedures were performed. To avoid the known effects of population stratification on genetic analysis (Lander and Schork, 1994) , we only included non-Hispanic Caucasian subjects identified by self-report and confirmed by multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) analysis (Stein et al., 2010) in both ADNI cohorts.\n1 adni.loni.ucla.edu"}, {"section_title": "Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative1", "text": "The ADNI1 cohort included three diagnostic groups: people with AD, MCI, and healthy elderly (cognitively normal) participants.

The variant previously associated with lower alcohol consumption predicted larger cortical volumes in the elderly at baseline. We replicated these findings in an independent elderly cohort despite a smaller sample size with lower statistical power, suggesting that the association of this variant with larger cortical volumes in the elderly may be independent of age, sex, or disease status. The same allele associated with reduced alcohol intake also predicted faster longitudinal ventricular expansion at 1-and 2-year follow up. The rs26907 polymorphism in RASGRF2 is associated with alcohol intake (Schumann et al., 2011; Stacey et al., 2012) , and this study further links it to regional brain volumes, in several systems involved in alcohol reward -where cellular and molecular processes including dopamine release are also affected by this gene. It may seem surprising that the rs26907 allele associated with reduced alcohol intake -which is the less common onepredicts larger regional cortical volumes in the elderly at baseline but faster ventricular expansion rates over time, reflecting an accumulation of brain tissue loss globally, throughout multiple brain regions. In fact, baseline regional cortical volumes are likely to depend on factors unrelated to neurodegeneration, such as neurodevelopmental differences. Even so, if the lateral ventricles expand approximately linearly with age in healthy elderly individuals (Blatter et al., 1995) , accelerated rates of ventricular Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience www.frontiersin.org expansion may be indicators or predictors of degenerative brain disorders (Apostolova et al., 2012) . The rs26907 polymorphism in RASGRF2 was associated with regional brain volumes and longitudinal ventricular expansion, but we are unable to provide mechanistic evidence for how this variant might affect brain structure. Rs26907 is an intronic SNP that is not linked with any known changes in gene function. SNPs in non-coding regions can affect gene splicing, and RAS-GRF2 may have one alternative splice variant (Feig, 2011) . This polymorphism may affect transcription factor binding, mRNA degradation, and other molecular genetic processes that may relate to brain volumes. Data from the encyclopedia of DNA elements (\"ENCODE\") 3 as presented in HaploReg 4 , suggest that rs26907 alters the Rad21 regulatory motif. Since Rad21 is a transcription factor involved in apoptosis (Pati et al., 2002) , programmed cell death represents a plausible mechanism by which this variant could affect brain volumes and rates of ventricular expansion, which indicate neuronal loss. Although we do not know the precise mechanisms that relate this polymorphism to brain structure, this particular variant may drive the observed associations, as there are no SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium (as defined by r 2 > 0.8) with rs26907 in the 1000 Genomes Caucasian (CEU) panel 5 .\nAn important limitation of this study is that no alcohol consumption measures were available in these samples (although the cohorts excluded alcohol abusers). We cannot establish a relationship between the rs26907 variant and alcohol intake, or among brain volumes, longitudinal ventricular expansion, and alcohol intake in these particular cohorts. Some of these associations have been reported in other cohorts. Our experimental design does reveal whether the variant of interest directly affects the brain or just modifies drinking behaviors that affect brain structure and the rate of brain atrophy. This would be an interesting target of study. Nonetheless, the functional imaging literature may shed light on our results. A haplotype containing rs26907 as well as other SNPs in RASGRF2 was associated with ventral striatal activity during reward anticipation in healthy 14-year old boys, suggesting a hypersensitive reward system (Stacey et al., 2012) . Follow-up at age 16 showed an association between this haplotype and number of drinking episodes (Stacey et al., 2012) . The existence of differences, first in brain activation and later in drinking behaviors, between young carriers of risk alleles in RASGRF2 and carriers of protective alleles, suggests that this gene may directly affect the developing brain. This may result in different drinking patterns later in life. Along with other behaviors, this may further affect brain structure and function throughout the lifespan.\nRASGRF2 regulates alcohol-induced reinforcement and alcohol preference is associated with whole-brain RASGRF2 mRNA expression (Stacey et al., 2012) . During neurodevelopment, carriers of the rs26907 allele associated with reduced drinking may have developed neurological circuits conferring less sensitivity to alcohol reward. This could be one factor associated with their volume differences in the medial prefrontal cortex, which plays a role in the mesolimbic reward system (Baltazar et al., 2013) . As a result, these individuals may have been more likely to abstain from drinking throughout their lives. In our study, this may be linked to the faster lateral ventricle expansion rates (typically associated with neurodegeneration across the brain) in elderly carriers of the allele. Elderly individuals who abstain from drinking have higher rates of brain abnormalities and infarcts than moderate drinkers (Mukamal et al., 2001; den Heijer et al., 2004; Mukamal, 2004) . This framework remains speculative, and future studies relating alcohol consumption data to brain imaging and genetic data, should clarify the direction of these relationships. Even so, our findings, combined with earlier functional imaging investigations of the same gene (Stacey et al., 2012) point to interdependent and reciprocal interactions between genes, brain, and drinking behaviors.
