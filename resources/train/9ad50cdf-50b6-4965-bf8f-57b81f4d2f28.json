[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "SARS-CoV-2 had infected over 61.8 million (61,866,635) people and caused over 1.4 million (1,448,990) deaths in 216 countries or regions by November 29, 2020 (1), and the ongoing epidemic trend of COVID-19 had posed a great threat to global public health (2) .\nPrevious researches on the origin or evolution of SARS-CoV-2 were mostly restricted to a limited number of virus genomes (3) (4) (5) , and the results were rather controversial (4) .\nRecently, a study had built a single nucleotide variants (SNVs) database of 42461 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, which could track the epidemic trend of single SNV over time (6) , however few studies focused on identification of key mutations in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 over time through linkage analysis and haplotype subgroup epidemic trends, which could reduce SARS-CoV-2 subgroup complexity greatly. In the previous study, we tracked the evolution trends of SARS-CoV-2 through linkage analysis and haplotype subgroup epidemic trends at three time points (March 22, 2020, April 6, 2020 and May 10, 2020), and found that the frequency of H1 haplotype with the 4 specific mutations (C241T, C3037T, C14408T and A23403G) increased over time, which indicated that they might be related to infectivity or pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 (7) . Thereinto, the A23403G mutation, which resulted in amino acid change of D614G in the spike protein, had been proved to be related to infectivity by several vitro experiments subsequently (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) .\nPhylogenetic tree had been used in most studies on the evolution of SARS-Cov-2 (3) (4) (5) 7, 14, 15) , but a reliable phylogenetic tree is relatively time-consuming or requiring a huge amount of computer resources because of bootstrapping, especially in the case of a large number of genome sequence analyses (16) . According to the phenomenon of virus DNA mutation in nature, mutations should be random mutated, so the frequencies of most mutations cannot reach a certain level in the population. According to the characteristics of virus transmission and epidemic, if the frequency of mutated allele at a certain site increases gradually over time, it indicates that the mutated site is likely to be related to infectivity or pathogenicity (7) . With the global epidemic of SARS-CoV-2, it is important to monitor the variation, haplotype subgroup epidemic trend and key mutations of SARS-CoV-2 effectively in real-time, which may help to the develop new vaccines, update therapeutic drugs, and improve detection reagents. Here we presented an innovative and integrative method and an automated tool to monitor haplotype subgroup epidemic trends and screen out the key mutations in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 over time efficiently.\nThis tool skips the process of using a large number of genome sequences to construct the phylogenetic tree, and it can complete all mutations detection, haplotypes classification, haplotype subgroup epidemic trends and key mutations analysis for 131,576 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences in 18 hours on a 1 core CPU and 2G internal storage computer, which will play an important role in monitoring the epidemic trend of SARS-CoV-2 and finding key mutation sites over time."}, {"section_title": "AutoVEM", "text": "AutoVEM is a highly specialized pipeline for fast monitoring the mutations and haplotype subgroup epidemic trends of SARS-Cov-2 by using virus genome sequences from GISAID.

Thereinto, 6 of them were found before January 23, 2020 and all of them were found before February 23, 2020 in different countries (Fig 3) , which indicated the complexity of SARS-Cov-2 evolution and spread at the early stage. The frequency and epidemic trend of haplotype subgroups of the 9 specific sites showed that H1, H5, H7, H9, H10 and H11 were prevalent in the world at the present stage, and H1 with the frequency of 0.7184 is the most epidemic haplotype subgroup (Table 1, Fig 3) . However, H2 with a larger proportion and H3 and H4 with a smaller proportion at the early stage which have almost disappeared at the present stage (Fig 3) . By carefully comparing the base composition of the 9 specific sites of H1, H5, H7, H9, H10 and H11 with those of H2, H3 and H4 (Table 1, Fig 3) , we still find that the 4 specific sites (C241T\u3001C3037T\u3001C14408T and A23403G) in Europe have an important influence on the viral infectivity, pathogenicity or host adaptability. Among the prevalent haplotype subgroups, H5, H7, H9 and H11 all had A23403G mutations, which indicated that the single A23403G mutation was related to infectivity, pathogenicity or host adaptability of SARS-CoV-2, while H10 had the other three specific mutations, including C241T, C3037T and C14408T, indicating that the combined mutations of these 3 sites also had a certain impact on infectivity, pathogenicity or host adaptability of SARS-CoV-2. However, H1 had these four mutations at the same time and showed an absolute epidemic advantage, which indicated that the simultaneous mutation of these four sites had a cumulative effect on infectivity, pathogenicity or host adaptability of SARS-CoV-2."}, {"section_title": "Linkage and haplotype analysis of the 23 sites with a frequency greater than 5%", "text": "A total of 23 SNVs with a frequency greater than 5% were filtered from 131576 SARS-CoV-2 genomes (Table 2 ).

The 23 haplotypes with a frequency greater than 1% were found and accounted for only 87.07% of the total population (Table S1 ). The frequency distribution of 23 haplotypes was relatively dispersed and the haplotype subgroup epidemic trends were complex (Table S1 , Fig S2) , which was difficult to find the regular pattern.\nAmong the 23 sites, we found that 6 mutation sites (T445C, C6286T, C22227T, G25563T, C26801G and G29645T) with a frequency greater than 20% might be highly linked ( Table 2 , Fig S1) . Therefore, we performed linkage analysis of the 6 sites separately, and only 4 haplotypes with a frequency greater than 1% were found and accounted for 99.50% of the total population (Fig 4) , which suggested that the 6 sites were indeed highly linked. Among these 23 sites, except for the 4 specific sites (C241T\u3001C3037T\u3001C14408T and A23403G) of the previous H1 haplotype with mutation frequency greater than 0.8, only the above 6 mutation sites of highly linked had higher frequencies, which indicated that the mutations of these 10 sites were more significant at the present stage. Therefore, we constructed haplotypes by combining the previous 4 specific sites and the 6 new sites to reveal the landscape of virus continuous evolution (from the early to the present stage)."}, {"section_title": "Linkage and haplotype analysis of the 10 sites", "text": "According to the linkage analysis and haplotype frequencies of the 10 sites (including the 4 specific sites of previous haplotype H1 and the 6 new sites), 11 haplotypes with a frequency greater than 1% were found and accounted for 95.14% of the total population ( Fig 5, Table 3 ). Among them, the three haplotypes (H1-1, H1-2 and H1-3) derived from the previous H1 accounted for 71.23% of all the population (Table 3) (Table 3, Fig 6) , and G25563T mutation was also found in several other haplotypes H9-2, H5-2 and H7-2 ( Table 3 ). The above haplotype subgroup epidemic trends showed that the mutation of 5 sites (T445C, C6286T, C22227T, C26801G and G29645T) or the single G25563T mutation may have some influence on infectivity, pathogenicity or host adaptability of SARS-CoV-2.\nIn general, the haplotype subgroups at the later stage are more complex and diverse than those at the earlier stage (Fig 3, Fig 6, Fig S2) , which may be related to the larger population and the more complex genome diversity.

All updated analysis data will be released on the website of https://github.com/Dulab2020/AutoVEM."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "According to linkage analysis and haplotype subgroup epidemic trends of the previous 9 specific sites for 131,576 genome sequences, we found that the frequency of H1 increased from 0.2880 (March 22, 2020), 0.4540 (April 6, 2020) and 0.6083 (May 10, 2020) at the early stage (7) to 0.7184 (November 30, 2020) at the present stage (Table 1) .\nMoreover, both the single mutation of A23403G or the combined mutations of C241T, C3037T and C14408T could influence the infectivity, pathogenicity or host adaptability of SARS-CoV-2, which further confirmed the 4 specific sites (C241T, C3037T, C14408T and A23403G) were important in the previous H1 haplotype (7) . The mutation of A23403G located in S genes and resulted in amino acid change of 614D>G (Table 2) , which has been proved to be related to infectivity by several in vitro experiments (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . Therefore, it is strongly recommended that the A23403G mutation should be taken into account in the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, especially RNA vaccines.\nSince mutations in the virus genome occur randomly, the frequencies of most mutations in the population could not reach a certain level, and they should have no impact on infectivity, pathogenicity or host adaptability of virus. In the present study, we screened the SNVs with the mutation frequency of more than 5% and only 23 SNVs were screened in 131576 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, which indicated the random mutation phenomena of SARS-CoV-2 genome. In the linkage and haplotype analysis of the 23 sites, we found the haplotypes of the 23 sites were complicated and could not find a specific haplotype subgroup trend (Table S1 , Fig S2) , which suggested that the selection of 5% mutation frequency might not be appropriate at the present stage. Then we focused on the 6 mutations (T445C, C6286T, C22227T, G25563T, C26801G and G29645T) with a frequency greater than 20% among 23 sites. It was found that the 6 sites were highly linked and only 4 haplotypes with a frequency greater than 1% were found and accounted for 99.50% of the total population (Fig 4) . A few haplotype subgroups represent almost all of the population, indicating that the linkage analysis of appropriate sites can reduce haplotype subgroup complexity. Moreover, the frequencies of two mutated haplotypes were 0.2160 and 0.2000 (Fig 4) , suggesting that these 6 sites might be valuable. Therefore, in the practice of using our tool to screen the candidate key sites, we can adjust the setting frequency according to the situation.\nSince the 4 specific sites and 6 new sites are more valuable at the early and present stage, the linkage analysis and haplotype subgroup epidemic trends of the 10 sites would reveal the landscape of virus continuous evolution (from the early to present stage).\nAccording to the haplotype subgroup epidemic trends and frequencies of the 10 sites, the previous H1 haplotype derived H1-2 and H1-3 haplotypes with new mutations and increasing trends, which indicated that the combined mutations of T445C, C6286T, C22227T, C26801G and G29645T at later stage or the single mutation of G25563T at earlier stage may have some influence on infectivity, pathogenicity or host adaptability of SARS-CoV-2. These 6 sites (T445C, C6286T, C22227T, G25563T, C26801G and G29645T) were located in ORF1ab, ORF1ab, S, ORF3a, M and ORF10 genes respectively. Among them, only C22227T, G25563T and G29645T caused amino acid changes of S, ORF3a and ORF10 proteins (Table 2), which indicated that these 3 sites might have more important contributions to infectivity, pathogenicity or host adaptability of SARS-CoV-2. Thereby, their epidemic trend should be tracked in the future. Among the haplotypes of the 10 sites, H1-2 haplotype subgroup had 614D>G and 222A>V double mutation in S protein, which might be related to its rapid spread, should be further confirmed and verified.\nIn the latest report, a lineage B1.177 with high proportion was obtained by using 126,219 genomes generated by the COG-UK consortium (22). This lineage had 222A>V (C22227T) mutation on the basis of 614D>G (A23403G) mutation, which was consistent with the results of the present study. Our results showed that the early H1 haplotype subgroup with the 4 highly linked sites (C241T, C3037T, C14408T and A23403G) derived H1-2 subgroup which had another 5 highly linked sites (T445C, C6286T, C22227T, C26801G and G29645T). Therefore, the use of linkage analysis in this study can provide some highly linked co-mutation information, which combined with haplotype subgroup epidemic trends over time, can provide a more comprehensive assessment of which mutations may contribute significantly to on infectivity, pathogenicity or host adaptability of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, they identified several other mutations of N439K, Y453F and N501Y in the S protein, but we did not (22,23). The possible reason is that the genome data analyzed was different. Besides, these mutations had a frequency of less than 5% according to their data (22,23), while our analysis filtered out mutation sites with a frequency of less than 5%. Among them, the frequency of N501Y mutation seems to reach 10% in the latest 28 days (13/11/2020 -10/12/2020), whether the frequency of the mutation will increase over time should be monitored to further infer the significance of the mutation. Our tool can be utilized to analyze any local or public SARS-CoV-2 genomes for real-time monitoring virus mutations and epidemic trends.\nIn conclusion, the AutoVEM tool, which integrated screening SNVs of relatively high mutation frequency, linkage analysis and haplotype subgroup epidemic trends over time, could automatically complete the analysis of 169,207 initial genome sequences and 131,576 filtered genome sequences on 1 core CPU and 2G internal memory computer within 18 hours. Through haplotype subgroup epidemic trends of 131,576 genome sequences, the significance of the previous 4 specific sites was further addressed, and 6 new mutation sites of highly linked, which might be related to infectivity, pathogenicity or host adaptability of SARS-CoV-2, were found for the first time and should be further monitored in the future. We provide a new idea of combinatorial analysis and an automated tool to monitor haplotype subgroup epidemic trends and key mutations in virus evolution in real-time and efficiently for the first time, which is of great significance for the development of new SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, the update of therapeutic drugs and detection reagents in advance. At the same time, the idea of combinatorial analysis could also provide a reference for mutation monitoring of other viruses."}, {"section_title": "AVAILABILITY", "text": "The developed AutoVEM software has been shared on the website (https://github.com/Dulab2020/AutoVEM) and can be available freely.
