[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Objective: Our goal was to evaluate the association of APOE with amyloid deposition, cerebrospinal fluid levels (CSF) of A\u03b2, tau, and p-tau, brain atrophy, cognition and cognitive complaints in E-MCI patients and cognitively healthy older adults (HC) in the ADNI-2 cohort.\nMethods: Two-hundred and nine E-MCI and 123 HC participants from the ADNI-2 cohort were included. We evaluated the impact of diagnostic status (E-MCI vs. HC) and APOE \u03b54 status (\u03b54 positive vs. \u03b54 negative) on cortical amyloid deposition (AV-45/Florbetapir SUVR PET scans), brain atrophy (structural MRI scans processed using voxel-based morphometry and Freesurfer version 5.1), CSF levels of A\u03b2, tau, and p-tau, and cognitive performance and complaints.\nResults: E-MCI participants showed significantly impaired cognition, higher levels of cognitive complaints, greater levels of tau and p-tau, and subcortical and cortical atrophy relative to HC participants (p < 0.05). Cortical amyloid deposition and CSF levels of A\u03b2 were significantly associated with APOE \u03b54 status but not E-MCI diagnosis, with \u03b54 positive participants showing more amyloid deposition and lower levels of CSF A\u03b2 than \u03b54 negative participants. Other effects of APOE \u03b54 status on cognition and CSF tau levels were also observed.\nConclusions: APOE \u03b54 status is associated with amyloid accumulation and lower CSF A\u03b2, as well as increased CSF tau levels in early prodromal stages of AD (E-MCI) and HC. Alternatively, neurodegeneration, cognitive impairment, and increased complaints are primarily associated with a diagnosis of E-MCI. These findings underscore the importance of considering APOE genotype when evaluating biomarkers in early stages of disease. "}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disease, featuring cognitive decline, accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, and extensive neurodegeneration (Alzheimer's Association, 2011; McKhann et al., 2011) . The most commonly accepted prodromal AD stage is mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is characterized by clinically-relevant cognitive dysfunction in the absence of significant interference with daily functioning (Petersen et al., 1999; Albert et al., 2011) . Amnestic MCI features marked memory impairments which are predictive of progression to clinical AD. Recently, MCI patients have been classified into two forms based on severity: early MCI (E-MCI) and late MCI (L-MCI). Relative to an age-appropriate normative level, E-MCI patients show an approximately 1-1.5 standard deviation (SD) decline in memory, while L-MCI patients show a 1.5 SD or greater decline. These designated cut-offs for E-MCI and L-MCI have not been fully explored to date. However, the identification of participants with a 1-1.5 SD deficit in memory as E-MCI may be more sensitive for identifying participants in the earliest stages of cognitive decline. However, the specificity of these diagnostic criteria has yet to be determined and may be lower than the L-MCI cut-offs, allowing participants with more diverse causal factors of cognitive decline (other than prodromal AD) to be included in this diagnostic category. Future studies examining these clinical criteria and clinical and pathological outcomes of identified E-MCI patients relative to L-MCI patients will be important for understanding the cognitive changes observed in these patients. Importantly, these new guidelines provide an opportunity to evaluate the role of AD biomarkers and other potential disease-causing factors in a very early clinical stage. In fact, a recent study demonstrated increased amyloid binding measured using [ 18 F]Florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with E-MCI relative to HC, but no alterations in metabolism as assessed using [ 18 F]FDG PET (Wu et al., 2012) .\nThe most common genetic variant associated with late-onset AD is the apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 allele (Corder et al., 1993; Bertram et al., 2010) . The presence of an \u03b54 allele confers a significantly higher likelihood of developing AD. APOE genotype is also associated with AD biomarkers, with the presence of an APOE \u03b54 allele associated with greater amyloid deposition (Drzezga et al., 2009; Morris et al., 2010; Fleisher et al., 2011) , a higher degree and faster rate of neurodegeneration (Moffat et al., 2000; Caroli and Frisoni, 2010) , alterations in brain function and glucose metabolism (Bookheimer et al., 2000; Bondi et al., 2005; Langbaum et al., 2009) , changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures of amyloid and tau (Vemuri et al., 2010; Tosun et al., 2011) , as well as more impaired cognition (Mayeux et al., 2001; Farlow et al., 2004; Caselli et al., 2011) in patients with L-MCI and AD and cognitively healthy older adults (HC). However, the role of APOE genotype in E-MCI has not been assessed. Therefore, the goal of this study is to evaluate the effect of APOE \u03b54 status on amyloid deposition, neurodegeneration, and cognition in patients diagnosed with E-MCI, the earliest clinically-defined prodromal stage of AD."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE NEUROIMAGING INITIATIVE (ADNI)", "text": "ADNI was launched in 2004 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), pharmaceutical companies, and non-profit organizations, as a multi-year public-private partnership.

Briefly, patients were diagnosed with E-MCI using the following criteria:\n1. Subject must have a subjective memory concern as reported by subject, study partner, or clinician. 2. Abnormal memory function documented by scoring within the education adjusted ranges on the Logical Memory II subscale (Delayed Paragraph Recall, Paragraph A only) from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (the maximum score is 25): a. 9-11 for 16 or more years of education. b. 5-9 for 8-15 years of education. c. 3-6 for 0-7 years of education.\n3.

As expected, we observed a significant association of diagnosis with clinical and cognitive status. Furthermore, diagnosis was associated with neurodegeneration and CSF tau and p-tau levels but not with amyloid deposition.\nCognitive performance, amyloid deposition, temporal lobe atrophy, and CSF tau and p-tau levels were significantly associated with \u03b54 status, with \u03b54+ participants showing poorer cognition, less temporal lobe atrophy, and higher CSF tau and p-tau levels. \u03b54+ participants also showed greater cortical amyloid deposition and lower CSF A\u03b2 levels. Finally, an interaction between diagnosis and \u03b54 status was observed for memory performance, temporal lobe cortical thickness, and CSF p-tau levels. Overall, the results suggest that APOE \u03b54 status impacts AD-related pathological and clinical changes in E-MCI and HC. The effect of APOE genotype on amyloid deposition has been shown previously, including in middle-aged and older cognitively healthy adults, as well as patients with L-MCI and AD (Drzezga et al., 2009; Shaw et al., 2009; Morris et al., 2010; Fleisher et al., 2011; Tosun et al., 2011 been shown to affect A\u03b2 clearance rate, with the APOE \u03b54 isoform showing significantly slower clearance (Deane et al., 2008; Castellano et al., 2011; Holtzman et al., 2012) . The lack of diagnostic effect on amyloid deposition in this study suggests that in the earliest stages of cognitive change, APOE \u03b54 status has a stronger relationship to amyloid deposition than cognitive status. The additional findings of a diagnostic effect on cognition, cognitive complaints, neurodegeneration, and CSF tau and p-tau levels underscore the importance of E-MCI as a diagnostic entity. Thus, this report has notable clinical implications, particularly in the potential implementation and utilization of E-MCI as a clinical diagnostic entity. Patients with E-MCI show changes in cognition and selected biomarkers, suggesting that these individuals may have a higher likelihood of clinical progression. The association of cognition and complaints to atrophic changes, rather than amyloid levels, supports E-MCI as an intermediate stage with pathology beyond amyloid accumulation.\nThese results further support the Jack et al. model of AD biomarkers, suggesting that changes in cognition and neurodegeneration occur after measurable amyloid accumulation (Saykin et al., 2010; Jack et al., 2011) . Additionally, APOE \u03b54 genotype may alter the hypothesized sigmoidal curves, in particular amyloid accumulation. These results also indicate the importance of genetic background in determining likelihood and extent of amyloid accumulation, even in preclinical stages, which may be particularly important in clinical trial enrollment. Further, in the era of personalized medicine, the implications of APOE genotype disclosure to patients in a clinical setting must be carefully considered, given the impact of APOE on AD risk and amyloid deposition (Green et al., 2009; Roberts et al., 2011) .\nThe observed greater temporal lobe cortical thickness and GM density in \u03b54+ participants, particularly in HC, is somewhat unexpected and may be related to the modest sample size of the \u03b54+ HC group. However, previous studies have observed increased cortical thickness, including in middle-aged APOE \u03b54 positive participants (Espeseth et al., 2008) , in cognitively HC who are transitioning to become CSF A\u03b2 biomarker positive (Fortea et al., 2011) , and in asymptomatic patients positive for a PSEN1 mutation more than 9 years prior to the clinical onset (Fortea et al., 2010) . Thus, future studies including longitudinal follow-up with an expanded sample will be important in determining the significance of this finding.\nThe present study has a few notable limitations. First, we evaluated the effect of APOE \u03b54 status on AD biomarkers in only HC and E-MCI rather than across the disease spectrum. Although our goal was to evaluate APOE in the earliest stages of AD, future studies assessing the full clinical spectrum are warranted. In addition, we did not evaluate all known biomarkers of AD, including FDG PET or advanced MRI techniques (i.e., diffusion tensor imaging, resting-state functional MRI, etc.). These measures are available in subsets of the ADNI-GO/2 cohort and thus, future studies evaluating these measures would augment the findings of the present report. Thirdly, genome-wide genetic data for this cohort was recently released. Future studies assessing other variants may provide information about the role of genetics in very early stages of AD. Finally, the present study evaluates only cross-sectional measures. Future studies using longitudinal and clinical outcome data will allow assessment of the role of APOE in progression of HC and E-MCI.\nIn summary, we assessed the role of APOE \u03b54 status on clinical and cognitive measures, cognitive complaints, and imaging and CSF biomarkers in HC and E-MCI participants from the ADNI-GO/2 cohort. We determined that APOE \u03b54 status is associated with increased amyloid deposition in both HC and E-MCI, while diagnostic category is associated with measures of cognition and cognitive complaints, as well as neurodegeneration. Therefore, we conclude that APOE is an important mediator of amyloid pathology in the earliest stages of AD-associated clinical decline."}]
