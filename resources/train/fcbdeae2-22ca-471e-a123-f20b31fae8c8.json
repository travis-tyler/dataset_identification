[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Purpose Rural US adults have increased risk of poor outcomes after cancer, including increased cancer mortality. Rural-urban differences in health behaviors have been identified in the general population and may contribute to cancer health disparities, but have not yet been examined among US survivors. We examined rural-urban differences in health behaviors among cancer survivors and associations with self-reported health and health-related unemployment. Methods We identified rural (n = 1,642) and urban (n = 6,162) survivors from the cross-sectional National Health Interview Survey (2006Survey ( -2010 and calculated the prevalence of smoking, physical activity, overweight/ obesity, and alcohol consumption. Multivariable models were used to examine the associations of fair/poor health and health-related unemployment with health behaviors and rural-urban residence. Results The prevalence of fair/poor health (rural 36.7 %, urban 26.6 %), health-related unemployment (rural 18.5 %, urban 10.6 %), smoking (rural 25.3 %, urban 15.8 %), and physical inactivity (rural 50.7 %, urban 38.7 %) was significantly higher in rural survivors (all p \\ .05); alcohol consumption was lower (rural 46.3 %, urban 58.6 %), and there were no significant differences in overweight/obesity (rural 65.4 %, urban 62.6 %). All health behaviors were significantly associated with fair/poor health and healthrelated unemployment in both univariate and multivariable models. After adjustment for behaviors, rural survivors remained more likely than urban survivors to report fair/ poor health (OR = 1.21, 95 % CI 1.03-1.43) and healthrelated unemployment (OR = 1.49, 95 % CI 1.18-1.88). Conclusions Rural survivors may need tailored, accessible health promotion interventions to address health-compromising behaviors and improve outcomes after cancer."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "activity have been linked with better outcomes for cancer survivors, including lower risk of recurrence and improved survival in several studies (for reviews see [21] [22] [23] [24] ). Continued smoking after cancer diagnosis has been associated with poorer outcomes, particularly for smoking-related cancers (e.g., [25] [26] [27] ). Although alcohol use is also associated with increased risk of several cancers [28] , less is known about the risks and benefits of alcohol consumption after cancer [21, 24] . If survivors choose to consume alcohol, they are generally advised to drink no more than a moderate amount [21, 29] . Meeting health behavior recommendations and exercise are also associated with better health-related quality of life after cancer [14, 30, 31] .\nIt is not known whether differences in health behaviors observed between rural and urban adults without cancer are also present among cancer survivors and if so, whether these differences in modifiable risk factors are related to poorer health outcomes among rural survivors. There are an estimated 2.8 million cancer survivors in the USA who reside in rural areas and are at increased risk for poor health and increased psychological distress relative to their urban counterparts [32] . In a study of Canadian rural and small town breast cancer survivors, Vallance et al. [33] found that 31 % met exercise recommendations, a prevalence very similar to other predominantly urban samples. In contrast, Rogerset et al. [34] reported that only 19 % of their sample of rural US breast cancer survivors met exercise recommendations. One Australian study found that urban colorectal cancer survivors were significantly less likely to maintain or achieve sufficient physical activity post-diagnosis compared to rural survivors [35] . With this exception, very few studies have directly compared health behaviors between rural and urban cancer survivors. Many interventions have been designed to positively influence health behaviors after cancer [19, 23] . If health behaviors contribute significantly to rural-urban survivorship disparities, then delivery of behavioral interventions targeting these modifiable risk factors to rural cancer survivors should be prioritized.\nThus, the purpose of our study was to (1) examine ruralurban differences in health behaviors in a population-based sample of cancer survivors, (2) assess whether health behaviors were associated with fair or poor self-reported health and unemployment due to health, and (3) evaluate whether rural-urban differences in health status persisted after controlling for health behaviors. Relative to urban survivors, we hypothesized that the prevalence of smoking, physical inactivity, and overweight/obesity would be higher among rural cancer survivors, and alcohol use lower. We also hypothesized that these behaviors would be independently associated with self-reported health and unemployment due to health. Finally, we hypothesized that controlling for health behaviors would reduce or eliminate the effect of rural-urban residence on self-reported health and unemployment due to health."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Setting", "text": "We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from the 2006-2010 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a continuous nationally representative survey of the noninstitutionalized, civilian US population [36] .

Overrepresentation of African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics is accomplished through the use of a complex sampling design. Both the questions and sampling design were identical from 2006 to 2010, so we pooled the data across these years to maximize the number of rural cancer survivors. The possibility of duplicate participation across years is extremely unlikely, thus yearly samples are considered to be independent. Trained US Census Bureau interviewers administer the survey in participants' homes.

Rural survivors were also more likely to report being physically inactive (50.7 % compared to 38.7 % of urban cancer survivors). In contrast, rural survivors were more likely to report lifetime abstinence from alcohol and less likely to report moderate or heavy drinking. There were no significant rural-urban differences in body mass index, although rural survivors did have a slightly higher prevalence of obesity.\nAssociations between health behaviors and health status\nIn separate adjusted models, all four health behaviors were significantly associated with both fair/poor self-reported health and unemployment due to health ( Table 3 ).

Obese but not overweight survivors were significantly more likely to report fair/poor health and to be unemployed for health reasons, as were current smokers and those survivors who were physically inactive. Former smokers were also significantly more likely to be in fair/poor health. A reduced risk of fair/poor health and unemployment due to health associated with consuming any amount of alcohol remained after adjustment for the other health behaviors and rural-urban status."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Our results mirror those reported in the general rural-urban health behavior literature and extend these findings to the context of cancer survivorship. Specifically, we documented a higher prevalence of current smoking and physical inactivity among rural compared to urban cancer survivors, as well as lower alcohol consumption. Body mass index did not differ. Furthermore, four modifiable risk factors-body mass index, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption-were all associated with both selfreported health and unemployment due to health among cancer survivors. Rural-urban differences in these outcomes were attenuated as hypothesized, but persisted despite the adjustment for the health behaviors. The high rates of smoking and lower participation in leisure-time physical activity we observed among rural survivors are very concerning. The prevalence of smoking among rural survivors (25 %) is substantially higher than that in urban survivors in our study (16 %) and the general population of US survivors [15, 18] . Similarly, half of our rural cancer survivors reported no physical activity, compared with only 31.5 % of all survivors from recent population estimates [18] . The cross-sectional nature of this study precludes us from knowing whether the differences observed among survivors are exclusively due to rural-urban differences prior to cancer or whether differential rates of quitting smoking or resumption of physical activity after cancer are involved. Although several studies have examined health behavior change after a cancer diagnosis (e.g., [44] [45] [46] ), to our knowledge, none have specifically examined ruralurban differences in positive or negative health behavior changes after cancer. It will be important for future studies to address this knowledge gap. However, we found no significant difference between urban and rural survivors for body mass index, unlike previous studies reporting an increased prevalence of obesity among rural adults [4, 47] . The prevalence of obesity in our sample (30.6 % rural and 27.9 % urban) is slightly higher than that in general US population studies (27.4 % rural and 23.9 % urban) [4] , but similar to the overall and regional prevalence ranges reported in a recent study of survivors [18] .\nSimilar to general population health surveys [13] , we observed that urban survivors were more likely than rural survivors to consume alcohol (infrequent through heavy use). Although rates of heavy drinking were similar in rural and urban survivors, we did not assess alcohol use disorders, which are more prevalent among rural adults, particularly in the Midwest [13] . Rural-urban differences in this study may be due to cultural/community traditions of alcohol abstinence and religious beliefs/norms, particularly in the rural South [13, 48] .\nConsistent with other studies among cancer survivors, we observed that health behaviors were significantly associated with patient-reported health outcomes [e.g., [14, 30, 49, 50] ]. To our knowledge, the association between health behaviors and health-related unemployment has not been previously described in cancer survivors. Other studies have linked both smoking and inadequate physical activity to recurrence, second cancers, and poorer survival (e.g., [21, 23, 26, [51] [52] [53] [54] ). Each model was adjusted for age, gender, marital status, race/ethnicity, education, geographic region, health insurance (self-reported health only), cancer type, and time since first cancer diagnosis. Odds ratios that are statistically significant, p \\ .05, are shown in bold a Inactive (no leisure-time aerobic activity that lasted at least 10 min), insufficiently active (aerobic activities for at least 10 min, but less than 150 min per week), or sufficiently active (moderateintensity leisure-time physical activity at least 150 min or vigorousintensity leisure-time physical activity at least 75 min per week) b Lifetime abstainer (less than 12 drinks in lifetime), former (12 or more drinks in lifetime, but none in the past year), current infrequent (1-11 drinks in past year), current light (B 3 drinks per week in past year), current moderate (4-14 drinks per week for men and 4-7 drinks per week for women), and current heavy (C 14 drinks per week for men, and C 7 drinks per week for women)\nLike many other studies of the general adult population [55, 56] , we identified a ''healthy drinker'' effect with survivors reporting any level of alcohol consumption being at lower risk of poor health relative to former drinkers and lifetime abstainers. Importantly for breast cancer survivors, there are mixed data linking alcohol consumption to breast cancer recurrence that should be considered when deciding whether or not to consume alcohol [21] . Nevertheless, smoking, body mass index, physical activity, and alcohol consumption do not appear to fully account for rural-urban differences in self-reported health and health-related unemployment that we observed. This persistence suggests that future research should be attuned to the role of community factors that may influence health after cancer in rural areas. These may include availability of oncology, primary care, and other health services such as rehabilitation and mental health, as well as community socioeconomic and social capital characteristics. It will also be important to examine the availability of cancer support organizations, as well as community norms regarding communication about cancer. Differences in cancer stage at diagnosis and receipt of guideline adherent cancer treatment are other factors that could account for ruralurban differences in the long-term health status of cancer survivors. Some, but not all, studies have identified rural disparities in these outcomes [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] . Longitudinal studies with well-characterized stage and treatment data could explore how treatment disparities impact long-term outcomes among survivors.\nOur results highlight the need for evidence-based, individual-level interventions to improve health behaviors and outcomes in rural cancer survivors. Survivors in urban areas may face more safety concerns associated with neighborhood crime or traffic, whereas barriers in rural areas may include a lack of places to exercise such as parks and malls [6] . Rural women also more commonly report lack of support from others to exercise, fear of injury, and interference by caregiving duties [5] . Telephone, mail, or Internet interventions may be better ways to reach rural survivors who face transportation challenges to attending classes or exercise programs that are typically held in urban centers. Home-based diet and exercise programs can be effective for increasing physical activity and improving quality of life among cancer survivors generally (e.g., [63, 64] ), and rural women with breast cancer specifically [65] . Telephone-based counseling is also an efficacious smoking cessation treatment both in cancer survivors [66] and in the general population [67, 68] and is widely available throughout the USA via state tobacco quit lines. E-health or m-health interventions may also have potential in this population because of their convenience, efficacy, and reach [69] . However, when compared to urban/suburban adults, rural adults are less likely to use the Internet, have a smart phone, and use their cell phone to look for health or medical information [70, 71] , suggesting that they may not be suitable for all rural survivors. Videoconferencing has been used to enhance psychosocial support among rural breast cancer survivors [72] , and new home-based point-topoint video conferencing technology may enhance rural survivor's ability to participate in behavioral interventions at home. In addition to approaches targeted at individual survivors, health systems interventions to promote the identification and treatment of risk factors among cancer survivors are needed, such as survivorship care planning. Community-based ecological approaches are also recommended to target tobacco use and obesity in the general population [73] and may ultimately have a public health impact for survivors as well. Our study sample included a large nationally representative sample of rural and urban survivors and utilized a robust classification of rural-urban residence. Thus, our results are pertinent to all cancer survivors in the USA. However, an important limitation of this study is use of self-reported data to ascertain cancer history, although several studies have confirmed the validity of self-reports of cancer [74, 75] . Under-reporting of smoking and body mass index and over-reporting of physical activity are also a concern [76] , but there is no reason to suspect differential reporting by rural-urban status. With this cross-sectional design, we cannot assess how health behaviors change after cancer or assess the directionality of observed associations. Finally, we used the dichotomous urban-rural definition based on county-based RUCC codes based on data availability and to be consistent with prior rural disparities research. County-based codes may result in under-or overbounding of rural areas, and dichotomous groupings may not fully recognize the heterogeneity within rural areas.\nYet on balance, these limitations are unlikely to explain our overall findings.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to describe health behaviors in relation to health status across urban and rural cancer survivors in the USA. In conclusion, we present data from a nationally representative sample of US cancer survivors, documenting a higher prevalence of smoking and physical inactivity among rural compared to urban survivors. Survivors who live in rural areas are a vulnerable sub-population at increased risk for poor health outcomes after cancer and are more likely to have healthcompromising behaviors. Health behaviors may be more easily modified at the individual level compared with other factors associated with rural-urban disparities (e.g., education, income, insurance, travel barriers). Thus, they should be an important focus of efforts to reduce disparities after cancer. Behavior change interventions for cancer survivors may need to be developed or adapted to address unique needs and barriers associated with rural residence. It will be important for future studies to move beyond simple categories to recognize the heterogeneity of rural communities and to better identify the community factors that may influence rural health disparities."}]
