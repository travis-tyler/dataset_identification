[{"section_title": "", "text": "Hong Kong's new academic structure has been a topic of much discussion and debate as the Education Bureau, secondary schools and tertiary institutions have worked relentlessly towards the ongoing education reform (Cheung, 2009; Morris & Adamson, 2010) . The New Secondary School Curriculum (NSSC) aims to cater to different students' diverse interests and aptitudes by offering students a range of elective subjects, providing structured \"other learning experiences\" (in the form of community service, career-related experiences and several other forms of moral, civic, aesthetic and physical experiences in education), and by including Chinese Language, English Language, Mathematics and Liberal Studies as the four core subjects (Education Commission [EC], 1999) . These changes have been introduced with a view to enhancing students' learning effectiveness.\nThe Hong Kong educational system in the past has been accused of spoon-feeding students and promoting rote learning as Hong Kong students use surface learning strategies and memorization to study, which make them passive learners (Cheung, 2007) . With the introduction of the NSSC, students will be enabled to connect knowledge of different disciplines so as to develop multiple perspectives on different issues. Students could become independent learners who can construct knowledge according to changing circumstances and enhance their problem solving ability, all of which can significantly contribute towards one of the key aims of the new curriculum: strengthening students' critical thinking skills (Cheung, 2009) . In view of this, this paper will argue that visual literacy can be integrated as an important aspect of the more flexible NSSC to help students think critically and creatively in Hong Kong's visually saturated environment. With visual images becoming the most predominant mode of communication, Aristotle's words (as cited in Benson, 1997, p. 141 ) -\"without image, thinking is impossible\" -go a long way towards showing the correlation between visual literacy and critical knowledge. The NSS education system can provide an invaluable opportunity to develop students' critical thinking ability through the planned introduction of visual literacy into the curriculum."}, {"section_title": "Defining visual literacy", "text": "\"Literacy\" has traditionally meant the ability to read and write. However, increasingly, it has also been used to refer to the ability to \"read images\" (Thibault & Walbert, 2010) . The proliferation of images in our culture in newspapers and magazines, in advertising, on television, and on the Web, all make it important for people to acquire basic visual literacy skills (Bittman, Rutherford, Brown, & Unsworth, 2011) . The term \"visual literacy\" was first used by John Debes in 1968. Visual communication is the process that involves sending and receiving messages using images. In that sense, broadly speaking, visual literacy can be defined as the ability to communicate and understand through visual means. Giorgis, Johnson, Bonomo, & Colbert, (1999) define it as the \"ability to construct meaning from visual images\" (p. 146). Felton (2008) takes this definition a step further and refers to visual literacy as the ability to understand, produce, and use culturally significant images, objects, and visible actions. Thus, visual literacy can be viewed as the ability to understand and explain images of the present and past, and produce images for the future that effectively communicate the intended message to the audience. Similarly, visual literacy may be defined as the critical ability to recognize and understand ideas conveyed through visible actions or images, as well as the ability to convey ideas or messages through imagery (Aanstoos, 2003) . Furthermore, in this recent digital environment, the significance of digital and visual literacies are acknowledged as \"the next wave of communication specialization wherein the majority of people have technologies at the tip of their fingers to not only communicate, but to create, to manipulate, to design, to self-actualize\" (Jones & Flannigan, 2006, p. 8) . The significance of visual literacy is asserted by Oring (2000, p. 58 ) that \"the need to learn to read visual images is an urgent one that touches at all levels in our society\". In summary, although visual literacy includes critical knowledge of relatively traditional elements such as facial expressions, body language, drawing, painting, sculpture, hand signs, street signs and international symbols, it increasingly refers to the more modern technological aspects of computer images, web pages and the elements of their design, layout of the pictures and words in a book, still pictures, sequences, movies or video, userfriendly equipment design, and critical analysis of television advertisements, as well as when they participate in other digital environments like online, gaming, and websites. In effect, visually literate students can be expected to play the roles of both the critical consumer and the critical producer of visual content (Ma & Semali, 2003) ."}, {"section_title": "The need for visual literacy", "text": "It has been argued that Hong Kong's school education system still remains entrenched in long-established, traditional and conventional pedagogies (Cheung, 2001; Forlin, 2010) . Therefore, its reliance primarily on the medium of print is not surprising. Though students in Hong Kong performed very well in international assessment like Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMMS), times have changed, however, and advances in technology facilitate the use of media as teaching resources and as described by Cheung (2005, p. 366) In the past, it was difficult for pupils to participate in media production as equipment was expensive and required a high level of skill to operate. This is no longer the case, as advances in communication technologies have made the cost of purchasing equipment more affordable and the skills needed to operate equipment more easily acquired.\nThe easy accessibility of the media is not the only reason leading to the development of visual literacy. It is well-documented that visual and multimedia formats capture students' interests and are more easily understood, allowing the learner to identify problem-solving steps and to focus on higher-level processes of critical thinking (Cooper, 2003) . Similarly, Stokes (2002) points out that many previous research reports published in the 1990s suggest that using visuals in teaching results in a greater degree of learning. This is primarily because each semiotic has its own specific (systemic) constraints and (material) affordances. Similarly, according to Kress and van Leeuwen (2006) , the things that can be achieved through visual representation cannot be done with language and vice versa. There has already been a respectable tradition in the area of semiotics which delves into gestural, bodily, animal and other non-linguistic ways of meaning-making (Eco, 1984; Sebeok, 1994) while in the French strand referred to as semiology (Barthes, 1977; Metz, 1977) a concern with images and films has for quite some time been prominent. For instance, the visual semiotic is generally continuous, sensorial and spatial while language is abstract, discontinuous, linear (temporal) and governed by strict syntactic conventions (Saint-Martin, 1995) . This might suggest that re-semiotization may involve privileging different domains of human experience, in particular those concerned with the sentient dimension of reading visuals. As Burnett (1995, p. 44) emphasizes in relation to photography:\n. . . photographs encourage the viewer to displace the conventional parameters of language use in order to create a new context for the articulation of meaning. A radically different conceptual framework may be initiated that does not, in and of itself, permit the easy use of either the verbal or the written for descriptive or interpretive purposes.\nIn effect, Kress and van Leeuwen's (1990) argument about contemporary visual communication being increasing independent of verbal languages is a powerful one. The grammar of verbal or written texts and images has developed side by side, so there is bound to be some congruence, but these similarities should not lead us to expect a linguistic model of grammar in the visual domain. In more radical terms, Kress and van Leeuwen (1990) suggest that the past dominance of the literary should not lead us to conclude that the visual domain is dependent on the linguistic. It is this independent quality of the visual medium or the image that students can use to develop their thinking in new ways, encumbered by the usual emphasis on reading and writing. This paper calls for the teaching of visual literacy under the New Secondary School Curriculum to enhance Hong Kong students' critical thinking skills because in our society as the ratio of visual images to text increases and people spend more time with digital visual media than ever before in a world dominated by bits and bytes, basic literacy and the thinking processes associated with it, have come to mean more than the ability to read and write (Callow, 2008; Goldfarb, 2002; Rheingold, 2008) . Consequently, the dominant position that text has enjoyed is slowly but gradually being rethought, as innovations in communication methods such as the World Wide Web challenge traditional forms of print communication (i.e., books and newspapers). Goodman and Greene (2003) note that with the explosion of the Internet and web-based communication, computer generated graphic design and printing has in many ways turned the printed word into image and the dominant form of language has become the image, adding that:\nThe image -still and moving, black and white and colour, chemically developed and electronically scanned, broadcast and downloaded, analog and digital -has been transforming and overshadowing the printed word. (Goodman & Greene, 2003, p. 5) Consequently, learning cannot be reduced to the acquisition of knowledge and skills primarily by written means. The primacy of the written word increasingly contrasts with the pragmatic roles that visual formats play in Hong Kong students' day-to-day lives. Although it is undeniable that the written and spoken word still remain the primary forms of communication, students also need to understand the importance of graphics and film, which are just as powerful today, especially because they are deeply intertwined with young people's culture in Hong Kong (Information Services Department, 2008; Office of the Telecommunications Authority [OFTA], 2009). Today's youth and children are regularly bombarded with images, and most of their awareness comes through the language of moving images on the screen. Thus, the language of the screen needs to be taught exactly the way students are taught writing or music (Daly, 2004) .\nIn Hong Kong, one only has to look around to see that the visual or image-based means of communication such as TV, film, and the Internet are the currently preferred mediums that students like to use for expressing their cultural orientations. According to the findings of the Household IT Survey in 2009, ICT had penetrated all walks of society and forms of economies activities. Some 1,756,300 households had personal computers (PCs), including desktop computers, laptop/notebook/netbook/tablet computers and palm top/ Personal Digital Assistance (PDA), at home, constituting 75.8% of all households in Hong Kong, and 73.3% of all households had their PCs at home connected to the Internet. About 97.7% of those households that had their PCs connected to the Internet in 2009 were connected to the Internet via broadband. In addition to connectivity to the Internet, Hong Kong also enjoys an impressive penetration rate for mobile subscription of 163.1%, meaning that there are 11.4 million mobile subscribers in a population of just seven million (Chu, 2010) . Hong Kong is also known for its high level of media saturation. The presence and use of mass media, and new forms of new media technologies, is one of the strongest and most pervasive in Hong Kong.\nFrom an early age, children watch quickly shifting images on the television screen. It is inconsequential whether these children understand all that is being presented on TV. However, what matters is the fact that as future students, they come to expect these features of presentation to accompany information. As children grow older, they are increasingly able to comprehend the multiply layered visual and verbal information from television or computer screens. Everywhere outside of school, students come across many different forms of visual images. These youth are referred to as the \"net generation\" due to their demographic characteristics and net usage, and have also been called the \"netgeners\" (Leung, 2003, p. 49) . They are viewed as being highly comfortable with the new media environment and have been referred to by means of other terms such as \"digital natives\" (Prensky, 2001 , p. 1) or \"digital immigrants\" (Ryberg & Dirckinck-Holmfeld, 2008, p. 145 ). Chu's study (2010) sought to find out further answers by conducting a research on Hong Kong secondary school students' participation in blogging and videosharing, the results of which are shown in Table 1 . Table 1 shows that although 71% of the respondents had their own blogs, 74.6% had never uploaded a video to a video-sharing site. However the overall trend among the secondary school students studied showed an increased exposure to visual media formats (as illustrated in Table 1 ). Despite this fact, teachers continue to dedicate considerable efforts to teaching young readers to read primary and secondary written texts, and their instructional practices often ignore the reality that in their spare time, students watch TV, play videogames, watch movies, look at advertisements and spend time on the computer. If Hong Kong schools want to continue to see themselves as linked to the world of work and leisure in any way, their methods of literacy education must reflect these worlds. Although visual forms of representations such as photographs, cartoons, line drawings, diagrams, concept maps, among others, have been used in classrooms for some time, the use of images has become much more pervasive in modern culture. In today's communication environment, visual representational formats can be in the form of visual images and their relationship to the written word in its various forms, including visual design in desktop publishing or the interface of visual and linguistic meaning in multimedia, among others. By educating students about these various visual formats, educators can equip their students with the necessary tools to thrive in this day and age of the screen and its images. Therefore, it is crucial that schools adapt their curricula and instructional practices accordingly because these new forms of communication in the electronic era, of which the visual is predominant, require a different teaching and learning approach.\nTherefore, from a curricular standpoint, as Hong Kong society relies more than ever before on visual communication strategies, visual literacy, which involves visual analysis skills, is becoming a vital communication need and must be taught in schools. In order to contribute to modern society and its needs, which are propelled by increasingly new global and technological developments, students must acquire critical visual literacy skills (Berk, 2009; Hug, 2012; Roblyer & Edwards, 2000) . Even though educators are often accused of resisting change, it is obvious that allowing the least challenging option -the constant use and overuse of the printed word and traditional text format -to define the dimensions of teaching and the potential for student learning in Hong Kong severely limits the prospects for engaging students in creativity and critical thinking. This goes against the basic premise of the introduction of the NSSC, with one of its primary aims being to enhance students' critical thinking skills. "}, {"section_title": "Developing critical thinking and the implementation of visual literacy in the classroom", "text": "The need for critical viewing skills has largely been taken for granted in this visual era. Every day we are exposed to thousands of images, but unfortunately, not many of us know how to \"read images\" (Duncum, 2010, p. 7) . Many students might believe what they see, and therefore, one of the ways to teach critical thinking is to start with the still image. The visually literate viewer or student can be expected to look at any kind of image carefully and critically, with an eye for the intentions of the image's creator. These images can convey information and ideas to critical-minded students, and this basic knowledge of visual literacy allows them to gather the information and ideas contained in an image, place them in context, and determine whether they are valid before they can proceed to the next level of producing their own visual content (Arizpe & McAdam, 2011) . Reinforcing the need for the teaching of visual literacy, Hocks (2003) emphasizes that education should involve the critique of the saturated visual and technological landscape that surrounds present day students. Moreover, Mitchell (2002) calls upon teachers to help students critically negotiate the visual world by \"overcoming the veil of familiarity and self-evidence that surrounds the experience of seeing, and turn it into a problem for analysis . . . \" (p. 166). Thus, several scholars have resoundingly made the case that critical thinking and new media technology with its visual focus must be tightly pedagogically bound (Bleed, 2005; Duffelmeyer, 2002; LeCourt, 1998) . Given the combination of computer technology and visual communication in this media environment, their production and reception possibilities need to be explicitly explored in the classroom. Callow (2010) highlights the benefits of bringing the visual into the classroom by arguing that images enhance student engagement, make it easier for students to draw connections between their day-to-day learning with their classroom knowledge and help build students' confidence because learning with images in the classroom begins with the caveat that there are no wrong interpretations when first discussing an image such as a painting or a photograph. This in turn also encourages students to go beyond their comfort zone and think more creatively. However, despite these above-mentioned advantages of visual literacy in learning and in stimulating out-of-the-box thinking, and persistent calls for critical thinking to be included in the school curriculum, concerns still remain about incorporating the visual into pedagogy. Hills (2004, pp. 108-110) notes that these range from the \"dislike and disparagement of mass culture\" to the misguided concern that writing will become subordinated to the visual in the classroom. However, rather than conceiving of visual literacy instruction in impoverishing either/or terms, Russell (2002, p. 332) "}, {"section_title": "believes:", "text": "It can be seen as opening up pedagogical space for critical literacy with the Deweyan responsibility towards students of a curricular balance between the interests of the learner and the demands of the disciplines, between our lives as individuals and our lives in democratic communities mediated by technologies of communication.\nBased on the above definitions, critical thinking in the context of visual literacy can be understood as the ability to see and create visual text not as a transparent window on reality, but as constructed from a viewpoint, with a communicative purpose and a calculated effect in mind. This is echoed in Willeman's (2002, p. 20) "}, {"section_title": "argument:", "text": "Education [should] concentrate, not on the transfer of information nor on the reproduction of value systems, but on the urgent task of equipping people with the necessary 'thinking tools' to make sense of historical processes so that individuals may become better at assessing the 'likely' verisimilitude of any account or representation of the world.\nIf students and their teachers are to meet the demands of the different forms of new literacies of this information era, they must be able to navigate and communicate through continuously evolving visual mediums. Visual literacy, when taught, can enable every student to engage actively with the increasing visual modes of communication not only by means of understanding, analysing and evaluating them, but also by the active creation and construction of visual forms of messages. The former, is however, not as simple as it may sound as it involves making judgements regarding the accuracy, validity and worth of messages (Metros, 2008) . Recent works focusing on the nature of visual images (Dikovitskaya, 2006; Kress & van Leeuwen, 2006; Manghani, 2008; Sturken & Cartwright, 2007) have contributed much to our knowledge about visual literacy and can be useful in teaching students how to decode and interpret visual messages correctly and to encode and compose meaningful visual communication. Branch, Kim, and Brill (2000) state that a visually literate person (or student) is able to: (1) discriminate, and make sense of visible objects as part of a visual acuity, (2) create static and dynamic visible objects effectively in a defined space, (3) comprehend and appreciate the visual testaments of others, and (4) conjure up objects in the mind's eye. This critical knowledge could be inculcated in students by teachers discussing with them the ways images have been used throughout history and by raising students' awareness of intentionality regarding how an image, object or event has been put together to offer a particular kind of experience, or to set up a certain kind of spectator. This can be done in creative and innovative ways so that imagination is interwoven through the idea of being \"critical\", and reasoned responses are combined with affective and imaginative responses (Bamford, 2003) .\nDuring lessons, students' critical awareness can be best developed through teachers showing various types of images for student discussion and by means of thoughtprovoking questioning on the part of the teachers. Thus, the integration of visual literacy instruction into the classroom curriculum can begin by teachers asking a few key questions to initiate the critical thinking process. Students can be taught to evaluate visual messages through questions such as (Riesland, 2005, p However, simply understanding the meaning behind visual messages is hardly adequate as students need to be taught how to ask themselves questions during the visual design process as well (Riesland, 2005, p. 4 "}, {"section_title": "):", "text": "-How can I visually show this message? -How can this message be made effective visually? -What are the audio-visual elements that can be used?\nMoreover, students can be taught the significance of noticing and appreciating the fact that visual messages exist everywhere, such as in dance, film, fashion, hairstyles, exhibitions, public monuments, interior design, lighting, computer games, advertising and photography. By beginning to take notice of the day-to-day visual elements, which are an integral part of their lives, students can not only find it appealing to study the messages conveyed through these images, but also develop a visually critical bent of mind. A visually aware critical student would then be able to (Bamford, 2003, p. 1): -Analyze the style and composition of the image; -Analyze the techniques used to produce the image; -Evaluate the aesthetic merit of the work; -Evaluate the merit of the work in terms of its purpose and the audience; -Understand the innovation (or lack of) the visual image's affective impact and the feelings it generates (or doesn't)\nFurthermore, frequent opportunities can be provided to the students whereby educators experienced in visual formats can encourage students to work together to produce a web page or produce an interactive movie, which would be in line with the constructivist notion of learning where students learn by doing things, coming up with ideas, solving problems and producing creative visual messages themselves. Thus, students will be involved in their own knowledge construction through discussion and creation of visual images rather than having constantly to depend on an external source. All these activities have great potential in developing students' critical thinking skills. Besides, these activities are likely to be of interest to students and can stimulate students' minds, thereby resulting in higher motivation for learning and retention of what is learned. Once students internalize these questions, not only will they recognize subtle, negative, harmful and propaganda messages conveyed through the various forms of new media and technology, but they will also be prepared to communicate with a level of visual sophistication that will carry them through the multimedia-dependent future higher education and the modern work environment in this dynamic and constantly changing online world."}, {"section_title": "The new senior secondary curriculum", "text": "From the Education Commission report, it was clear that the major motivation was to help Hong Kong to respond to unprecedented changes in the world (Education Commission, 1999) . Apart from the traditional emphases on ethics, intellect, physique, social skills and aesthetics, schools in Hong Kong were expected to produce a new generation of students who could learn on their own, think for themselves, and explore new arenas of learning. Under the new structure, two subjects could facilitate the teaching of visual literacy."}, {"section_title": "Liberal Studies", "text": "Liberal Studies is called upon in the NSSC as a core subject for senior secondary students as it \"provides opportunities for students to make explicit connections among different disciplines, examine issues from multi-perspectives\", and construct personal knowledge. The subject is indispensable to nurture the young mind (Education Bureau, 2005) . In marked contrast to traditional, specialized subjects, Liberal Studies are issue-oriented, encouraging students to study and discuss current, far-reaching, usually hotly debated issues and events.\nThese issues and events, in turn, come primarily through the mass media, both in printed and audio-visual forms. Therefore, without the ability to critically read, view and analyse media texts and to discern the special techniques and representation patterns being used, students will likely engage in a false debate of prevalent fallacies and groundless arguments. As a lot of media evidence is presented in the form of visual images, the critical visual literacy skills are needed if students are to be able to conduct critical, informed discussions in a media-saturated environment. This combination of visual literacy with Liberal Studies, then, allows students to critically analyse media messages, to compare preconceptions with discoveries, to engage in enlightened discussions, and ultimately to enhance both their critical thinking and citizenship skills, to participate fully in the democratic society. The above description fits in Freedman's (2003) idea of emphasizing the importance of visual culture to a democratic education."}, {"section_title": "Visual Arts", "text": "In the NSSC, Visual Arts is placed as one of the 20 elective subjects. It is hoped that studying in the visual arts stretches and nurtures the aesthetic potential of young people and in the process of learning and teaching visual arts, the cultivation of visual literacy is significant. While this is a new move and the number of students taking this subject is relatively small, further research needs to be conducted to see how this subject could equip students with critical visual literacy skills enabling them to become informed citizens in the future."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "While considering the need to integrate visual literacy into the NSSC, it is worthwhile to note that most of the information absorbed by an individual is actually collected through the sense of vision. However, visual literacy remains in a state of academic infancy in Hong Kong. Bleed (2005) notes that new learners, new technologies, new work force skills, and new modes of creative expression are driving the need for visual literacy. Thus, it is a necessary component of the current educational system as visual media become integral to education, entertainment, communication and work. Developing visual literacy as a life skill can be an important step in the future towards a more successful implementation and development of the NSSC as contemporary culture becomes increasingly dependent on the visual.\nThe new NSSC offers an invaluable chance to act. Opportunities for visual understanding, critique and expression are passed over every day in favour of traditional reading and writing, while the new means of visual communication remain largely unaddressed in the classroom. Although it will be a while before the teaching and measurement of visual literacy through standardized testing in our educational system is clearly established, it is an essential and growing proficiency that will determine how effectively one navigates communication systems in contemporary society. Therefore, efforts need to be made to integrate visual literacy skills into the NSSC in Hong Kong. The current demands for education of the visual forms of communication will impel students to be truly literate in the complete sense in today's world because to be an effective communicator, a student needs to be able to interpret, select and create images to convey a range of meanings (Hobbs, 2008) . However, before Hong Kong's education system reaches this important landmark, it is critical to ensure that its teachers possess skills that include not only teaching with visual aids, but also the ability to teach visual literacy. Unless education in the near future moves in this direction, schools will grow increasingly further away from the learning skills and foundations of factual knowledge that Hong Kong society needs. In order to bring about such alterations in literacy education in Hong Kong, numerous changes in attitudes and actions are needed as soon as possible."}]
