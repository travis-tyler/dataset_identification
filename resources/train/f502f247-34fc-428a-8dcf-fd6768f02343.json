[{"section_title": "", "text": "The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) gathers data on all aspects of education from across the United States and releases the resulting surveys and studies as survey reports, information compendia, and special reports that focus on specific educational topics. NCES also participates in joint research activities, :srings togethr data collected by federal, state, and local agencies, and reports on education in the United States compared with other countries. Brief descriptions are given for the following NCES components and surveys related to elementary and secondary education: (1) Common Core of Data; (2) Private School Survey; (3) School District Data Book; (4) Schools and Staffing Survey; (5) National Assessment of Educational Progress; and (6) several elementary and secondary longitudinal studies. The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, the National Study of Postsecondary Faculty, postsecondary longitudinal studies, and the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study collect data related to postsecondary education. The National Household Education Survey and the various library surveys are other data gathering operations of NCES. NCES also collects data from adult literacy surveys and the Data on Vocational Education project and it participated in international studies, such as the Third International Mathematics and Science Study. Some data reporting operations, including the Fast Response Survey System, are described. What activity involves more than 1 out of every 4 Americans, with expenditures totalling 7.4 percent of the gross domestic product? Participation in formal education of some kind. What experience has been shared by 82 percent of all Americans age 25 or older? Graduation from high school. Is student enrollment growing or shrinking? What is the trend in teachers' salaries? How do states compare in teacher/student ratios and educational attainment? Is the cost of college continuing to rise? Finding the answers to these and many other questions is more than just a trivial pursuit. Statistics are the directional signs along the road to quality education for all Americans. We must know where we have been, so that we can better understand where we are going. Most Americans have memories of their own formal education and have strong opinions based on those experiences. Personal contact is a powerful learning tool, but no single experience, no matter how powerful, can compare with facts gathered from a broader perspective. Such is the wealth of statistical material collected and released by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)."}, {"section_title": "2", "text": "NCES gathers data on all aspects of education from across the country, organizes the data in useful forms, and releases the resulting surveys and studies as survey reports, information compendia, and special reports that focus on specific educational topics.

NCES is a multimedia operation, producing annual and periodic statistical material as printed publications, postings on the Internet, and as CD-ROM data sets."}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "A A NCES serves a wide variety of data users who ask questions on many issues. Some examples include: Federal, state, and local governments request data for a variety of purposes. Congress uses data to study education issues, to plan federal programs, and to serve constituents' needs. Federal agencies, such as the Departments of Commerce and Labor, are concerned with the supply of trained manpower coming out of schools. State and local officials confront problems of staffing and financing public education. The media use NCES data to inform the public about such matters as school and college enrollment and expenditures per student. Education organizations, such as the American Council on Education, the National Education Association, and the American Federation of Teachers, use data for planning and research. Colleges use institution-level data on enrollment, finances, and graduation ratios to make comparisons with other postsecondary institutions. The general public uses education statistics to become more knowledgeable and to make informed decisions about current educational issues. Researchers perform specialized analyses using NCES databases. Businesses use trend data on enrollments and expenditures to forecast demand for their products. NCES studies cover the entire educational spectrum, providing the facts and figures needed to help policymakers understand the condition of education in the nation today, to give researchers a foundation of data to build upon, and to help teachers and administrators decide the best practices for their schools. NCES annually produces three major publications which enjoy wide circulation: The Condition of Education, Digest of Education Statistics, and Projections of Education Statistics. These publications present statistics on a broad array of education topics. The following pages provide brief summaries of NCES studies, including a sampling of the important findings. Gains in average reading scores for nine-year-old students were observed from 1971 to 1980, but did not continue in the 1980s and 1990s. Thirteen-year-old students had higher scores in 1996 than in 1971, but remained constant in the 1980s and 1990s. Seventeenyear-olds showed modest gains over the entire 25 year period. Early and more recent gains among 13-year-old students in the upper quartile resulted in an overall pattern of increased performance; a similar trend was demonstrated by 9-year-olds, but not by 17-year-olds."}, {"section_title": "NATIONAL ASSESSMENT OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS", "text": "The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is a Congressionally mandated program that assesses the knowledge and skills of the nation's youth. Representative samples of 4th-, 8th-, and 12th-grade students are assessed in reading, mathematics, science, writing, history, geography, and other subject areas. NAEP also provides comparative state data for a large number of states that voluntarily participate in selected assessments. Long term trends are followed in the areas of reading, writing, mathematics, and science. High School Transcript Studies (HSTS) have also been done in conjunction with NAEP. High school transcripts inform researchers about course-taking patterns of students. The NAEP studies allow investigation of the relationship between course-taking and performance."}, {"section_title": "9", "text": "What percent of young people go to college? Nearly 63 percent of 1988 eighth-graders had attended some type of postsecondary education by 1994. Of those attending postsecondary education, about 57 percent were at public or private four-year colleges or universities; 36 percent were enrolled in public twoyear colleges; and the remainder (7 percent) attended trade or technical programs of shorter duration."}, {"section_title": "ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY LONGITUDINAL STUDIES", "text": "These statistics and many more on students, professional staff, and assessment can be computed using the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88). Data were collected from students and their parents, teachers, and high school principals, as well as through cognitive tests and high school transcripts. NELS plans to continue surveying the 1988 eighth graders through the year 2000. Findings from NELS:88 can be compared to data from earlier NCES sponsored longitudinal studies. These longitudinal studies, which follow cohorts of students of varying initial ages, provide detailed information on academic growth, high school dropouts, and experiences in postsecondary education and the world of work. These studies are long-term surveys that follow specific classes of students before, during, and after high school. At the end of each study, educational and occupational aspirations can be compared against actual attainment. The majority of faculty work hours are spent teaching students. Faculty members reported in 1992-93 that 54 percent of their time was spent in the classroom, while the next two largest categories of work were research (17 percent) and administration (13 percent). Faculty reported in 1992-93 on average that they would prefer to spend roughly the same amount of time teaching that they currently do, but more time on research. .4EMEE Students at private institutions in 1995-96 were more likely to receive aid than their counterparts at public universities and colleges. Sixty-three percent of public full-time undergraduate students reported financial assistance, while almost 80 percent of full-time students at private universities received aid."}, {"section_title": "NATIONAL POSTSECONDARY STUDENT AID STUDY", "text": "The National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) reports on higher education expenses, distribution of financial aid, and characteristics of aided and non-aided students. Administrative records concerning student financial aid are coupled with student interviews and data from a subsample of parents. NPSAS provides a recurrent database used by policymakers to determine federal policy concerning student financial aid. The goal is to identify institutional, student, and family characteristics related to program participation. NPSAS generates items of interest to researchers about all postsecondary students, such as factors associated with choice of postsecondary institutions, parental support for postsecondary education, and occupational and educational aspirations. Which children are attending early childhood programs? Children from higher income brackets were more likely to attend center-based early childhood programs than those from more moderate income brackets. In 1995, children from families with incomes over $50,000 per year were more likely to attend programs for 2 years or more than children from families with incomes of $50,000 or less. While 72 percent of all first-graders had previously attended center-based early childhood programs, a smaller proportion of Hispanic first-graders (57 percent) had participated in these programs than their white (73 percent) or black (76 percent) counterparts."}, {"section_title": "NATIONAL HOUSEHOLD EDUCATION SURVEY", "text": "The National Household Education Survey (NHES) is a household based telephone survey that covers varied educational topics, including program participation, home activities, early childhood and adult education, as well as parental involvement in education, and the role of families in children's learning. Extensive family and household background information is included as well as school and program characteristics. The NHES collects data on high priority topics on a rotating basis. Although the primary purpose of the NHES is to conduct repeated measurements of the same phenomena at different points in time, one-time surveys on topics of interest to the Department of Education may also be What is happening in vocational education? The average number of Carnegie units or credits earned in vocational education by public high school graduates declined 17 percent between 1982 and 1994. Public high school graduates earned an average of 4.7 credits in vocational education in 1982 and 3.9 credits in 1994. During this same time period, academic coursetaking increased about 21 percent, from 14 to 17 credits."}, {"section_title": "DATA ON VOCATIONAL EDUCATION", "text": "The Data on Vocational Education (DOVE) project derives data on vocational education from NCES' secondary and postsecondary surveys. The transcript studies, the longitudinal 'studies, and SASS are the primary sources of vocational data in secondary education. At the postsecondary level, IPEDS, NPSAS, and the longitudinal studies are the primary sources for vocational education data. The project compares vocational education students, teachers, and schools with their non-vocational counterparts. The primary use of the DOVE system is to report on the status of vocational education. The system allows researchers to compare students who are concentrating in vocational education with those students who are not concentrating in vocational education. "}]
