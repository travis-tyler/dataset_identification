[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Our nation's schools should be safe havens for teaching and learning, free of crime and violence. Any instance of crime or violence at school not only affects the individuals involved, but also may disrupt the educational process and affect bystanders, the school itself, and the surrounding community (Brookmeyer, Fanti, and Henrich 2006;Goldstein, Young, and Boyd 2008). Establishing reliable indicators of the current state of school crime and safety across the nation and regularly updating and monitoring these indicators are important in ensuring the safety of our nation's students. This is the aim of Indicators of School Crime and Safety. Executive Summary iv there were 25 homicides and 6 suicides. During the same time period, there were 11 homicides and 3 suicides of school-age youth (ages 5-18) at school (Indicator 1). \u00bb During the 2010-11 school year, 11 of the 1,336 homicides among school-age youth ages 5-18 occurred at school. 6 During the 2010 calendar year, 3 of the 1,456 suicides of youth ages 5-18 occurred at school (Indicator 1)."}, {"section_title": "Nonfatal Student and Teacher Victimization", "text": "\u00bb \u00bb \u00bb \u00bb Between 1992 and 2012, the total victimization rates for students ages 12-18 generally declined both at school (from 181 to 52 per 1,000) and away from school (from 173 to 38 per 1,000). This pattern also held for thefts, violent victimizations, and serious violent victimizations (Indicator 2). In 2012, students ages 12-18 were victims of about 1,364,900 nonfatal victimizations at school, 7 including 615,600 thefts 8 and 749,200 violent victimizations, 9 89,000 of which were serious violent victimizations 10 (Indicator 2). In 2012, a greater number of students ages 12-18 experienced victimizations (theft and violent crime) at school than away from school. That year, 52 victimizations per 1,000 students occurred at school, and 38 victimizations per 1,000 students occurred away from school (Indicator 2). The rates of total victimization at and away from school were greater for males than for females ages 12-18 in 2012 (Indicator 2). \u00bb \u00bb \u00bb \u00bb \u00bb \u00bb \u00bb In 2012, students ages 12-18 residing in urban or suburban areas had higher rates of violent victimization at school than those residing in rural areas (Indicator 2). Between 1995 and 2011, the total percentage of students ages 12-18 who reported being victimized at school, as well as the percentages of students who reported theft, violent victimization, and serious violent victimization, decreased (Indicator 3). Four percent of students ages 12-18 reported being victimized at school during t he previous 6 months in 2011. Three percent of students reported theft, 1 percent reported violent victimization, and one-tenth of 1 percent reported serious violent victimization (Indicator 3). In 2011, a higher percentage of students ages 12-18 attending public schools reported being victimized than students attending private schools (4 vs. 2 percent; Indicator 3). Seven percent of students in grades 9-12 reported being threatened or injured with a weapon, such as a gun, knife, or club, on school property 11 in 2011. Specifically, 3 percent of students were threatened or injured with a weapon 1 time, 2 percent were threatened or injured with a weapon 2 or 3 times, 1 percent were threatened or injured with a weapon 4 to 11 times, and 1 percent were threatened or injured with a weapon 12 or more times (Indicator 4). In each survey year, a higher percentage of males than females in grades 9-12 reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property. For example, in 2011, approximately 10 percent of males and 5 percent of females were threatened or injured with a weapon on school property. These percentages were not measurably different from the percentages of males and females who were threatened or injured with a weapon on school property in 2009 (Indicator 4). During the 2011-12 school year, a higher percentage of public than private school teachers reported being threatened with injury (10 vs. 3 percent) or being physically attacked (6 vs. 3 percent) by a student from their school (Indicator 5). Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2013 v \u00bb Ten percent of elementary teachers and 9 percent of secondary teachers reported being threatened by a student from their school in 2011-12. The percentage of elementary teachers who reported being physically attacked by a student was higher than the percentage of secondary teachers (8 vs. 3 percent;Indicator 5)."}, {"section_title": "School Environment", "text": "\u00bb \u00bb \u00bb \u00bb During the 2009-10 school year, 85 percent of public schools recorded that one or more crime incidents had taken place at school, 12 amounting to an estimated 1.9 million crimes. This translates to a rate of 40 crimes per 1,000 public school students enrolled in 2009-10. During the same year, 60 percent of public schools reported a crime incident that occurred at school to the police, amounting to 689,000 crimes-or 15 crimes per 1,000 public school students enrolled (Indicator 6). In 2009-10, about 74 percent of public schools recorded one or more violent incidents of crime, 16 percent recorded one or more serious violent incidents, 44 percent recorded one or more thefts, and 68 percent recorded one or more other incidents. 13 Forty percent of public schools reported at least one violent incident to police, 10 percent reported at least one serious violent incident to police, 25 percent reported at least one theft to police, and 46 percent reported one or more other incidents to police (Indicator 6). During the 2009-10 school year, 23 percent of public schools reported that bullying occurred among students on a daily or weekly basis, and 3 percent reported widespread disorder in classrooms on a daily or weekly basis (Indicator 7). Sixteen percent of public schools reported that gang activities had occurred during the 2009-10 school year, and 2 percent reported that cult or extremist activities had occurred during this period. The percentages of public schools that reported gang activity at all at their schools during 12 \"At school\" was defined for respondents to include activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to include incidents that occurred before, during, or after normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session. 13 \"Other incidents\" include possession of a firearm or explosive device; possession of a knife or sharp object; distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs or alcohol; vandalism; and inappropriate distribution, possession, or use of prescription drugs. the school year decreased from 20 percent in 2007-08 to 16 percent in 2009-10 (Indicator 7). \u00bb \u00bb \u00bb \u00bb \u00bb \u00bb Nine percent of public schools reported that student acts of disrespect for teachers other than verbal abuse occurred at least once a week in 2009-10, lower than the 11 percent in 2007-08 (Indicator 7). The percentage of students ages 12-18 who reported that gangs were present at their school decreased from 20 percent in 2009 to 18 percent in 2011. A higher percentage of students from urban areas (23 percent) reported a gang presence than students from suburban (16 percent) and rural areas (12 percent) in 2011. The percentage of students from urban areas who reported a gang presence decreased from 31 percent in 2009 to 23 percent in 2011 (Indicator 8). In 2011, approximately 19 percent of students ages 12-18 attending public schools reported that gangs were present at their school, compared with 2 percent of students attending private schools. The percentage of private school students who reported a gang presence at their school was not measurably different between the two most recent survey years, 2009 and 2011 (2 percent in each year). In contrast, the percentage of public school students who reported a gang presence decreased from 22 percent in 2009 to 19 percent in 2011 ( Indicator 8). The percentage of students in grades 9-12 who reported that illegal drugs were offered, sold, or given to them decreased from 32 percent in 1995 to 26 percent in 2011. The percentage of students who reported that drugs were made available to them on school property in 2011 (26 percent) was higher than in 2009 (23 percent; Indicator 9). In 2011, a higher percentage of 10th-graders reported that illegal drugs were made available to them on school property than 9th-graders or 12th-graders. In addition, higher percentages of American Indian/Alaska Native students (40 percent), Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian students (39 percent), and Hispanic students and students of two or more races (33 percent each), than White, Black, or Asian students (23 percent each) reported that drugs were offered, sold, or given to them on school property (Indicator 9). The percentage of students ages 12-18 who reported being the target of hate-related words decreased from 12 percent in 2001 to 9 percent in 2011, and the percentage of students who reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school during the school year decreased from 36 percent in 1999 to 28 percent in 2011 (Indicator 10). \u00bb \u00bb \u00bb \u00bb \u00bb In 2011, there were no measurable differences in the percentages of students ages 12-18 who reported being called hate-related words or who reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school by race/ethnicity. Eight percent of White students, 9 percent of Asian students, 10 percent of Hispanic students, and 11 percent of Black students reported being called a hate-related word. Twentyeight percent each of Black and White students, 29 percent of Hispanic students, and 30 percent of Asian students reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school in 2011 ( Indicator 10). In 2011, about 28 percent of 12-to 18-year-old students reported being bullied at school during the school year. A higher percentage of females than of males ages 12-18 reported that they were made fun of, called names, or insulted (19 vs. 16 percent), were the subject of rumors (24 vs. 13 percent), and were excluded from activities on purpose (6 vs. 5 percent). The percentage of males (9 percent) who reported being pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on was higher than the percentage of females who reported the same bullying problem (7 percent;Indicator 11). In 2011, a higher percentage of students in 6th grade than of students in grades 7 through 12 reported being bullied at school during the school year. About 37 percent of 6th-graders reported being bullied at school, compared with 30 percent of 7th-graders, 31 percent of 8th-graders, 26 percent of 9th-graders, 28 percent of 10th-graders, 24 percent of 11th-graders, and 22 percent of 12th-graders (Indicator 11). In 2011, approximately 9 percent of students ages 12-18 reported being cyber-bullied anywhere during the school year. Of those students, about 4 percent each reported that another student had posted hurtful information on the Internet and reported being the subject of harassing text messages. Female students reported being the victims of these types of cyber-bullying problems at higher percentages than males in 2011. For example, 6 percent of females versus 2 percent of males reported that another student posted hurtful information about them on the Internet, and the same percentages of females and males, respectively, reported being the subject of harassing text messages (Indicator 11). Overall and for most student and school characteristics, no pattern was observed between 2005 and 2011 in the percentages of students ages 12-18 reporting bullying at school; however, a higher percentage of students reported being bullied in 2007 (32 percent) than in Indicator 11).\n"}, {"section_title": "\u00bb \u00bb \u00bb", "text": "The percentage of teachers who reported that student misbehavior interfered with their teaching f luctuated between 1993-94 and 2011-12; however, the percentage of teachers reporting that student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching increased over this time period (from 25 to 35 percent). Between 1993-94 and 2011-12, the percentage of teachers who reported that school rules were enforced by other teachers fluctuated between 64 and 73 percent, and the percentage who reported that rules were enforced by the principal fluctuated between 82 and 89 percent (Indicator 12) In 2011-12, about 38 percent of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that student misbehavior interfered with their teaching, and 35 percent reported that student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching. Sixty-nine percent of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that other teachers at their school enforced the school rules, and 84 percent reported that the principal enforced the school rules (Indicator 12). A higher percentage of public school teachers (41 percent) than of private school teachers (22 percent) reported that student misbehavior interfered with their teaching in 2011-12. In addition, 38 percent of public school teachers reported that student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching, compared with 19 percent of private school teachers.

Generally, a higher percentage of students in 9th grade reported having been in fights than students in any other grade, both anywhere and on school property. A smaller percentage of Asian students reported being in fights anywhere and on school property than students of other racial/ ethnic groups. In addition, 4 percent of males said Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2013 vii they had been in a fight anywhere twelve or more times, compared to 1 percent of females, and 1 percent of males said they had been in a fight on school property twelve or more times, compared to less than half a percent of females (Indicator 13). \u00bb \u00bb \u00bb \u00bb \u00bb \u00bb Between 1993 and 2011, the percentage of students in grades 9-12 who reported carrying a weapon anywhere on at least 1 day during the past 30 days declined from 22 percent to 17 percent, and the percentage who reported carrying a weapon on school property on at least 1 day also declined, from 12 percent to 5 percent (Indicator 14). In 2011, among students in grades 9-12, 26 percent of males reported carrying a weapon anywhere, compared to 7 percent of females, and 8 percent of males reported carrying a weapon on school property, compared to 2 percent of females (Indicator 14). The percentage of students in grades 9-12 reporting that they had access to a gun without adult permission was lower in 2009 and 2011 (6 percent and 5 percent, respectively) than it was in 2007 (7 percent). In all three survey years, a higher percentage of male students than female students reported having access to a gun without adult permission. For example, in 2011, about 6 percent of males reported having access to a gun without adult permission, compared to 4 percent of females (Indicator 14). From 2009 to 2011, there were no measurable changes in the percentages of male students who reported alcohol consumption anywhere or on school property. Among females, however, the percentage of students in grades 9-12 who reported consuming alcohol anywhere decreased from 43 percent in 2009 to 38 percent in 2011, and the percentage of female students who reported consuming alcohol on school property increased from 4 percent in 2009 to 5 percent in 2011 (Indicator 15).

In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades 9-12 were asked about their general involvement in physical fights (referred to as \"anywhere\" in this indicator), as well as about their involvement in physical fights on school property, during the 12 months preceding the survey. 33 In this indicator, fights occurring anywhere are used as a point of comparison with fights occurring on school property. Overall, the percentage of students who reported being in a physical fight anywhere decreased from 42 percent in 1993 to 33 percent in 2011. Similarly, the percentage of students who reported being in a physical fight on school property decreased from 16 percent in 1993 to 12 percent in 2011 (figure 13.1 and table 13.1). There was no measurable difference between the 2009 and 2011 percentages of students in grades 9-12 who reported being in a fight anywhere, nor was there a measurable difference between the 2009 and 2011 percentages of students in these grades who were in a fight on school property. Students were also asked how often they were in physical fights during the past 12 months. In 2011, about 24 percent of students had been in a fight anywhere 1 to 3 times, 6 percent were in fights 4 to 11 times, and 3 percent were in fights 12 or more times (table 13.2). About 10 percent of students were in a fight on school property 1 to 3 times, 1 percent were in fights 4 to 11 times, and 1 percent were in fights 12 or more times. From 1993 through 2011, the percentage of students in grades 9-12 who reported being in a physical fight anywhere and on school property decreased for all four grade levels (figure 13.1 and table 13.1). Generally, a higher percentage of students in 9th grade than in any other grade reported being in fights, either anywhere or on school property. For example, in 2011, about 38 percent of 9th-graders reported being in a fight anywhere, compared with 30 percent of 11th-graders and 27 percent of 12th-graders (there was no measurable difference in the percentages of 9th-graders and 10th-graders who reported being in a fight anywhere that year). Similarly, 16 percent of 9th-graders, compared with 13 percent of 10thgraders, and 9 percent each of 11th-and 12th-graders reported being in a fight on school property in 2011. The percentage of students who reported being in a physical fight differed by race/ethnicity in 2011 (figure 13.2 and table 13.1). A smaller percentage of Asian students reported being in physical fights anywhere and on school property than other racial/ethnic groups.

Although the data presented in this report are the most recent data available at the time of publication, the data do not cover the most recent two or more school years. The report is not intended to be an exhaustive compilation of school crime and safety information, nor does it attempt to explore reasons for crime and violence in schools. Rather, it is designed to provide a brief summary of information from an array of data sources and to make data on national school crime and safety accessible to policymakers, educators, parents, and the general public. Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2013 is organized into sections that delineate specific concerns to readers, starting with a description of the most serious violent crimes. The sections cover violent deaths; nonfatal student and teacher victimization; school environment; fights, weapons, and illegal substances; fear and avoidance; discipline, safety, and security measures, and campus safety and security. Each section contains a set of indicators that, taken together, aim to describe a distinct aspect of school crime and safety. Where available, data on crimes that occur outside of school grounds are offered as a point of comparison. 1 Supplemental tables for each indicator provide more detailed breakouts and standard errors for estimates. A glossary of terms and a reference section appear at the end of the report. This edition of the report contains updated data for five indicators: violent deaths at school and away from school (Indicator 1), incidence of victimization at school and away from school (Indicator 2), teachers' reports of being threatened with injury or being physically attacked by students (Indicator 5), teachers' reports on school conditions (Indicator 12), and safety and security measures taken by public and private schools (Indicator 20). In addition, this year's report introduces a new indicator on criminal incidents at postsecondary institutions (Indicator 22). Also included in this year's report are references to publications relevant to each indicator that the reader may want to consult for additional information or analyses. These references can be found in the \"For more information\" sidebars at the bottom of each indicator."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The indicators in this report are based on information drawn from a variety of independent data sources, including national surveys of students, teachers, principals, and postsecondary institutions and universe data collections from federal departments and agencies, including BJS, NCES, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Office of Postsecondary Education. Each data source has an independent sample design, data collection method, and questionnaire design, or is the result of a universe data collection. 1 Data in this report are not adjusted to reflect the number of hours that youths spend on school property versus the number of hours they spend elsewhere. The combination of multiple, independent sources of data provides a broad perspective on school crime and safety that could not be achieved through any single source of information. However, readers should be cautious when comparing data from different sources. While every effort has been made to keep key definitions consistent across indicators, differences in sampling procedures, populations, time periods, and question phrasing can all affect the comparability of results. For example, both Indicators 20 and 21 report data on selected security and safety measures used in schools. Indicator 20 uses data collected from a schools and staffing survey administered to public and private school principals about safety and security practices used in their schools for the 2011-12 school year, as well as from a survey of public school principals about safety and security practices used in their schools during the 2009-10 school year. The schools range from primary through high schools. Indicator 21, however, uses data collected from 12-through 18-year-old students residing in a sample of households. These students were asked whether they observed selected safety and security measures in their school in 2011, but they may not have known whether, in fact, the security measure was present. In addition, different indicators contain various approaches to the analysis of school crime data and, therefore, will show different perspectives on school crime. For example, both Indicators 2 and 3 report data on theft and violent crime at school based on the National Crime Victimization Survey and the School Crime Supplement to that survey, respectively. While Indicator 2 examines the number of incidents of crime, Indicator 3 examines the percentage or prevalence of students who reported victimization. Table A provides a summary of some of the variations in the design and coverage of sample surveys used in this report. Several indicators in this report are based on selfreported survey data. Readers should note that limitations inherent to self-reported data may affect estimates (Addington 2005;Cantor and Lynch 2000). First, unless an interview is \"bounded\" or a reference period is established, estimates may include events that exceed the scope of the specified reference period. This factor may artificially increase reported incidents because respondents may recall events outside of the given reference period. Second, many of the surveys rely on the respondent to \"self-determine\" a condition. This factor allows the respondent to define a situation based upon his or her own interpretation of whether the incident was a crime or not. On the other hand, the same situation may not necessarily be interpreted in the same way by a bystander or the perceived offender. Third, victim surveys tend to emphasize crime events as incidents that take place at one point in time. However, victims can often experience a state of victimization in which they are threatened or victimized regularly or repeatedly. Finally, respondents may recall an event inaccurately. For instance, people may forget the event entirely or recall the specifics of the episode incorrectly. These and other factors may affect the precision of the estimates based on these surveys. Data trends are discussed in this report when possible. Where trends are not discussed, either the data are not available in earlier surveys or the wording of the survey question changed from year to year, eliminating the ability to discuss any trend. Where data from samples are reported, as is the case with most of the indicators in this report, the standard error is calculated for each estimate provided in order to determine the \"margin of error\" for these estimates. The standard errors of the estimates for different subpopulations in an indicator can vary considerably and should be taken into account when making comparisons. With the exception of Indicator 2, in this report, in cases where the standard error was between 30 and 50 percent of the associated estimate, the estimates were noted with a \"!\" symbol (Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between 30 and 50 percent). In Indicator 2, the \"!\" symbol cautions the reader that estimates marked indicate that the reported statistic was based on fewer than 10 cases. With the exception of Indicator 2, in cases where the standard error was 50 percent or greater of the associated estimate, the estimate was suppressed (Reporting standards not met. Either there are too few cases for a reliable estimate or the coefficient of variation (CV) is 50 percent or greater). See appendix A for more information. The appearance of a \"!\" symbol (Interpret data with caution) in a table or figure indicates a data cell with a high ratio of standard error to estimate so the reader should use caution when interpreting such data. These estimates are still discussed, however, when statistically significant differences are found despite large standard errors. Introduction 4 of the comparison being tested. The primary test procedure used in this report was Student's t statistic, which tests the difference between two sample estimates. The t test formula was not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Linear trend tests were used to examine changes in percentages over a range of values such as time or age. Linear trends tests allow one to examine whether, for example, the percentage of students who reported using drugs increased (or decreased) over time or whether the percentage of students who reported being physically attacked in school increased (or decreased) with age. When differences among percentages were examined relative to a variable with ordinal categories (such as grade), analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for a linear relationship between the two variables. Percentages reported in the tables and figures are generally rounded to one decimal place (e.g., 76.5 percent), while percentages reported in the text are generally rounded from the original number to whole numbers (with any value of 0.50 or above rounded to the next highest whole number). While the data labels on the figures have been rounded to one decimal place, the graphical presentation of these data is based on the unrounded estimates. Appendix A of this report contains descriptions of all the datasets used in this report and a discussion of how standard errors were calculated for each estimate. Table A. Nationally representative sample and universe surveys used in this report SAVD defines a school-associated violent death as \"a homicide, suicide, or legal intervention (involving a law enforcement officer), in which the fatal injury occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school in the United States.\" Schoolassociated violent deaths include those that occurred while the victim was on the way to or returning from regular sessions at school or while the victim was attending or traveling to or from an official schoolsponsored event. Victims of school-associated violent deaths include not only students and staff members, but also others who are not students or staff members, such as parents. Between July 1, 2010 and June 30, 2011, there were 31 school-associated violent deaths in elementary and secondary schools in the United States (figure 1.1 and table 1.1). Of the 31 student, staff, and nonstudent schoolassociated violent deaths occurring between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2011, there were 25 homicides and 6 suicides. Data for school-associated violent deaths for the 2010-11 school year are preliminary until interviews with law enforcement personnel have been completed. Data on homicides and suicides occurring at school and away from school were drawn from a number of sources. Data on violent deaths occurring away from school were included in order to compare them to data on violent deaths occurring at school. The most recent data available for total suicides of school-age youth (ages [5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18] are for the 2010 calendar year; the most recent data available for total homicides of youth are for the 2010-11 school year. 3 During the 2010-11 school year, there were 1,336 homicides of youth (figure 1.2 and table 1.1). During the 2010 calendar year, there were 1,456 suicides of youth. During the 2010-11 school year, there were 11 homicides and 3 suicides of school-age youth at school (figure 1.1 and table 1.1), and, when instances of homicide and suicide of school-age youth at school were combined, there was approximately 1 homicide or suicide for each 3.5 million students enrolled. 4 The percentage of youth homicides occurring at school remained at less than 2 percent of the total number of youth homicides over all available survey years, even though the absolute number of homicides of school-age youth at school varied to some degree across the years (figure 1.1 and table 1.1). Between the 1992-93 and 2010-11 school years, from 1 to 10 school-age youth committed suicide at school each year, with no consistent pattern of increase or decrease in the number of suicides. The percentage of youth suicides occurring at school remained at less than 1 percent of the total number of youth suicides over all available survey years.   1 Data from 1999-2000 onward are subject to change until interviews with school and law enforcement officials have been completed. The details learned during the interviews can occasionally change the classification of a case. For more information on this survey, please see appendix A. 2 A school-associated violent death is defined as \"a homicide, suicide, or legal intervention (involving a law enforcement officer), in which the fatal injury occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school in the United States,\" while the victim was on the way to or from regular sessions at school, or while the victim was attending or traveling to or from an official school-sponsored event. Victims include students, staff members, and others who are not students, from July 1, 1992 through June 30, 2011.

"}, {"section_title": "Indicator 2 Incidence of Victimization at School and Away From School", "text": "Following nearly two decades of steady decline, the total nonfatal victimization rate at school was higher in 2012 than in 2010 for students ages 12-18 (52 vs. 35 victimizations per 1,000 students). The victimization rate away from school was also higher in 2012 than in 2010 (38 vs. 27 victimizations per 1,000 students). Theft and violence both at school and while going to and from school can affect the overall health and well-being of adolescents, interfere with educational goals, and stall normal healthy development (Fredland 2008). This type of victimization can also lead to higher-than-average rates of teacher turnover, increases in student dropout rates, students changing schools, principals and teachers retiring early, increases in student fear of violence at school, and a decline in learning (Crews, Crews, and Turner 2008). In 2012, data from the National Crime Victimization Survey 5 showed that more victimizations were committed against students ages 12-18 at school than away from school. 6 Students ages 12-18 experienced about 1,364,900 nonfatal victimizations (theft 7 and violent crime 8 ) at school, 9 compared to about 991,200 nonfatal victimizations away from school (table 2.1). These figures represent total crime victimization rates of 52 victimizations per 1,000 students at school and 38 per 1,000 students away from school. For most years between 1992 and 2008, the rates of theft at school among students ages 12-18 were higher than the rates of theft away from school, but there were no measurable differences between these rates in 2009, 2010, or 2011.

An uncertain percentage of these persons may not have attended school during the survey reference period. These data do not take into account the number of hours that students spend at school or away from school. 7 \"Theft\" includes attempted and completed pursesnatching, completed pickpocketing, and all attempted and completed thefts, with the exception of motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not include robbery, which involves the threat or use of force and is classified as a violent crime. 8 \"Violent victimization\" includes serious violent crimes and simple assault. 9 \"At school\" includes inside the school building, on school property, or on the way to or from school. at school (24 victimizations per 1,000 students) was greater than the rate of theft away from school (18 per 1,000 students). Between 1992 and 2000, the rates of violent victimization per 1,000 students at school were either lower than the rates away from school or not measurably different than the rates away from school. Since 2001, the rates of violent victimization per 1,000 students at school have generally been higher than the rates away from school or not measurably different than the rates away from school. In 2012, the rate of violent victimization at school (29 per 1,000 students) was greater than the rate of violent victimization away from school (20 per 1,000 students). This difference was driven primarily by a higher rate of simple assault at school that year. 10 Rates of serious violent victimization 11 against students ages 12-18 at school were generally lower than those occurring away from school in most survey years between 1992 and 2008; between 2009 and 2012 there were no measurable differences in these rates. Between 1992 and 2012, the total victimization rates for students ages 12-18 generally declined both at and away from school. The total victimization rate against students ages 12-18 at school decreased from 181 victimizations per 1,000 students in 1992 to 52 victimizations per 1,000 students in 2012. Away from school, the rate of total victimization declined from 173 victimizations per 1,000 students to 38 victimizations per 1,000 (figure 2.1). This pattern also held for thefts, violent victimizations, and serious violent victimizations between 1992 and 2012. Thefts at school declined from a rate of 114 per 1,000 students to 24 per 1,000, and the rate of Indicator 2 continued on page 11. 10 \"Simple assault\" is the difference between total violence and serious violence. It includes threats and attacks without a weapon or serious injury. 11 \"Serious violent victimization\" includes the crimes of rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault. This indicator has been updated to include 2012 data. For more information: Tables 2. 1 and 2.2;Fredland (2008);and Crews, Crews, and Turner (2008). theft away from school decreased from 79 thefts per 1,000 students to 18 per 1,000. The rate of violent victimization at school declined from 68 victimizations per 1,000 students in 1992 to 29 per 1,000 in 2012. Away from school, the rate of violent victimization declined from 94 victimizations per 1,000 students to 20 per 1,000. Serious violent victimizations at school declined from 8 per 1,000 students in 1992 to 3 per 1,000 in 2012. Serious violent victimization rates away from school declined from 43 victimizations per 1,000 students in 1992 to 7 per 1,000 in 2012. In the most recent period between 2011 and 2012, there were no measurable differences in the rates of total, theft, violent, or serious violent victimizations at or away from school. However, the total, theft, and violent victimization rates at school increased from 2010 to 2012. The rates of total and violent victimization away from school increased from 2010 to 2012. Between 2010 and 2012, there were no measurable differences between the rates of theft away from school and serious violent victimization at school or away from school. 1 Serious violent victimization is also included in all violent victimization. NOTE: Due to methodological changes, use caution when comparing 2006 estimates to other years. \"Serious violent victimization\" includes the crimes of rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault. \"All violent victimization\" includes serious violent crimes as well as simple assault. \"Theft\" includes attempted and completed purse-snatching, completed pickpocketing, and all attempted and completed thefts, with the exception of motor vehicle thefts.

SOURCE: U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), 1992-2012. The victimization rates for students in 2012 varied according to student characteristics. The total victimization rate at school was greater for students ages 12-14 (65 per 1,000 students) than for students ages 15-18 (41 per 1,000 students; table 2.2). This age difference was due primarily to the higher rate of violent victimization at school for younger students (42 per 1,000 students ages 12-14) compared to older students (16 per 1,000 students ages [15][16][17][18]. No measurable differences were found by age group in the rates of theft victimization at school. There were no measurable differences between age groups in the rates of total victimization, theft, and violent victimization away from school in 2012 (figure 2.2). The rates of total victimization at and away from school were greater for males than for females in 2012. Males experienced 60 nonfatal victimizations per 1,000 students at school, compared to 45 victimizations per 1,000 females. Away from school, males experienced 45 nonfatal victimizations per 1,000 students, and females experienced 31 victimizations per 1,000 students (figure 2.3). The apparent differences between male and female rates of victimization for theft and violent crime at and away from school in 2012 were not statistically different. Students residing in urban or suburban areas had higher rates of violent victimization at school than those residing in rural areas in 2012. Violent victimization rates at school were 38 per 1,000 students in urban areas and 28 per 1,000 students in suburban areas, compared to 14 per 1,000 students in rural areas. There were no measurable differences in the violent victimization rates away from school for students living in urban, suburban, or rural areas.  ! Interpret data with caution.

Three percent of students reported theft, 1 percent reported violent victimization, and one-tenth of 1 percent reported serious violent victimization in 2011. Between 1995 and 2011, the total percentage of students ages 12-18 who reported being victimized at school, as well as the percentages of students who reported theft, violent victimization, and serious violent victimization, decreased. The School Crime Supplement 12 collects data on the percentage of students ages 12-18 who reported criminal victimization at school 13 during the previous 6 months. In addition to the total percentages reported by students, victimization is also reported by type, namely theft, 14 violent victimization, 15 and serious violent victimization. 16 Results from the most recent data collection show that in 2011, approximately 4 percent of students ages 12-18 reported being victimized at school during the previous 6 months. Three percent of students reported theft, 1 percent reported violent victimization, and one-tenth of 1 percent reported serious violent victimization (figure 3.1 and table 3.1). In 2011, reports on the prevalence of victimization varied by some school and student characteristics. Differences were observed by school type in the reporting of victimization in 2011. A higher percentage of students attending public schools reported being victimized at school compared with students attending private schools (4 percent vs. 2 percent). The percentage of students reporting theft was also higher at public schools (3 percent) than at private schools (1 percent) in 2011. There were some measurable differences in student reports of victimization by grade in 2011.

This percentage was not measurably different from the percentage who were threatened or injured with a weapon on school property in 2009 (8 percent). Every year, some students are threatened or injured with a weapon while they are on school property. The percentage of students victimized in this way provides a measure of how safe our schools are, and of whether levels of safety in schools have changed over time. In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades 9-12 were asked whether and how often they had been threatened or injured with a weapon on school property during the 12 months preceding the survey. In 2011, about 7 percent of students reported they were threatened or injured with a weapon, such as a gun, knife, or club, on school property 17 (table 4.1). This percentage was not measurably different from the percentages of students who reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property in 2009 (8 percent), or in 1993 (7 percent), the first year of data collection. In each survey year, a higher percentage of males than females reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property (figure 4.1 and table 4.1).

Specifically, the percentage of students who reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property in 2011 was smaller for White students (6 percent) than for students of two or more races (10 percent) and Hispanic and Black students (9 percent each; figure 4.2 and table 4.1). Generally, the percentage of students who reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property was higher for lower grade levels (table 4.1). For example, in 2011, a smaller percentage of 12thgraders (6 percent) than of 9th-and 10th-graders (8 percent each) reported that they were threatened or injured with a weapon on school property. Students were asked how many times they had been threatened or injured with a weapon on school property during the previous 12 months. A greater percentage of students experienced being threatened or injured 1 time in the previous 12 months compared with those who reported being threatened or injured 2 or 3 times, 4 to 11 times, and 12 or more times (figure 4.3 and table 4.1). In 2011, about 3 percent of students were threatened or injured with a weapon 1 time, 2 percent were threatened or injured with a weapon 2 or 3 times, 1 percent were threatened or injured with a weapon 4 to 11 times, and 1 percent were threatened or injured with a weapon 12 or more times. In 2011, the percentage of public school students who reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property varied among the 38 states and the District of Columbia for which data were available. Among these states, the percentage of students who reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property ranged from 5 percent in Wisconsin to 12 percent in Georgia (table 4.2).

Students are not the only victims of intimidation or violence in schools. Teachers are also subject to threats and physical attacks, and students from their schools sometimes commit these offenses. The Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) asks school teachers whether they were threatened with injury or physically attacked by a student from their school in the previous 12 months. During the 2011-12 school year, 9 percent of school teachers reported being threatened with injury by a student from their school (table 5.1). This percentage was lower than the 12 percent of teachers who reported being threatened with injury in 1993-94, but higher than the percentages of teachers who reported being threatened with injury in 2003-04 and 2007-08 (7 percent each) (figure 5.1). The percentage of teachers reporting that they had been physically attacked by a student from their school in 2011-12 (5 percent) was higher than in any previous survey year (ranging from 3 to 4 percent). During the 2011-12 school year, there were no measurable differences in the percentages of male and female teachers who reported being threatened with injury during the school year (9 percent each); however, there were gender differences in the reports of being physically attacked (figure 5.2). Six percent of female school teachers reported being physically attacked by a student from their school, compared with 4 percent of male teachers. There were some differences in the percentages of teachers who reported being threatened by a student and being physically attacked by the race/ethnicity of the teacher. In the 2011-12 school year, a higher percentage of Black teachers (14 percent) than White teachers and teachers of other racial/ethnic groups (9 percent each) reported being threatened by a student from their school during the school year. A higher percentage of Black teachers (8 percent) than Hispanic teachers (4 percent) reported being physically attacked by a student. The percentages of teachers who reported being threatened with injury or being physically attacked during the school year by a student from their school varied by school characteristics during the 2011-12 school year (figure 5.3). The percentage of elementary teachers who reported being physically attacked by a student was higher than the percentage of secondary teachers reporting it (8 vs. 3 percent). In addition, a higher percentage of public than private school teachers reported being threatened with injury (10 vs. 3 percent) or being physically attacked (6 vs. 3 percent) by a student during 2011-12. Public school teachers' reports of being threatened with injury or physically attacked varied among the states and the District of Columbia. During the 2011-12 school year, the percentage of public school teachers who reported being threatened with injury during the previous 12 months ranged from 5 percent in Oregon to 18 percent in Louisiana (table 5.2). The percentage who reported being physically attacked ranged from 3 percent in Alabama, Mississippi, North Dakota, Oregon, and Tennessee to 11 percent in Wisconsin.  1993-94 1999-2000 2003-04 2007-08 2011-12 NOTE: Teachers who taught only prekindergarten students are excluded.

In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public school principals were asked to provide the number of violent incidents, 18 serious violent incidents, 19 thefts of items valued at $10 or greater without personal confrontation, and other incidents 20 that occurred at their school. 21 Public school principals were also asked to provide the number of incidents they reported to the police. This indicator presents the percentage of public schools that recorded one or more of these specified crimes, the total number of these crimes recorded, and the rate of crimes per 1,000 students. These data are also presented for crimes that were reported to the police. In all survey years the percentage of public schools that recorded incidents of crime was between 85 and 86 percent, with the exception of school year 2003-04. In 2003-04, the percentage of public schools that recorded incidents of crime was 89 percent. Similarly, the percentage of public schools that reported incidents of crime to the police was between 60 and 62 percent in all survey years with the exception of 2003-04, when 65 percent of public schools reported one or more incidents to the police. For the majority of types of crime, the percentages of public schools recording incidents of crime or 18 \"Violent incidents\" include rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attack or fight with or without a weapon, threat of physical attack with or without a weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon. 19 \"Serious violent incidents\" include rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attack or fight with a weapon, threat of physical attack with a weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon. 20 \"Other incidents\" include possession of a firearm or explosive device; possession of a knife or sharp object; distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs or alcohol; vandalism; and inappropriate distribution, possession, or use of prescription drugs. 21 \"At school\" was defined for respondents to include activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to include incidents that occurred before, during, or after normal school hours, or when school activities or events were in session. reporting incidents of crime to the police in 2009-10 were not measurably different from the percentages of schools doing so in 2007-08. However, the percentage of schools that recorded vandalism decreased from 49 percent in 2007-08 to 46 percent in 2009-10. During the 2009-10 school year, 85 percent of public schools recorded that one or more of these incidents of violence, theft, or other crimes had taken place, amounting to an estimated 1.9 million crimes (figure 6.1 and table 6.1). This figure translates to a rate of approximately 40 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled in 2009-10. During the same year, 60 percent of schools reported one of the specified crimes to the police, amounting to about 689,000 crimes-or 15 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled. In 2009-10, a greater percentage of schools recorded an incident of crime than reported an incident of crime to the police. This pattern held true for violent crimes, serious violent crimes, thefts, and other crimes. Seventy-four percent of schools recorded one or more violent incidents of crime (a rate of 25 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled), 16 percent recorded one or more serious violent incidents (a rate of 1 crime per 1,000 students enrolled), 44 percent recorded one or more thefts (a rate of 5 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled), and 68 percent recorded one or more other incidents (a rate of 9 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled). In comparison, 40 percent of public schools reported at least one violent incident to police (a rate of 6 reported crimes per 1,000 students), 10 percent reported at least one serious violent incident to police (a rate of less than 1 percent reported crimes per 1,000 students), 25 percent reported at least one theft to police (a rate of 3 reported crimes per 1,000 students), and 46 percent reported one or more other incidents to police (a rate of 6 reported crimes per 1,000 students).  1 \"Violent incidents\" include rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attack or fight with or without a weapon, threat of physical attack with or without a weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon. 2 \"Serious violent incidents\" include rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attack or fight with a weapon, threat of physical attack with a weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon. 3 \"Theft or larceny\" (taking things worth over $10 without personal confrontation) was defined for respondents as \"the unlawful taking of another person's property without personal confrontation, threat, violence, or bodily harm.\" This includes pocket picking, stealing a purse or backpack (if left unattended or no force was used to take it from owner), theft from a building, theft from a motor vehicle or motor vehicle parts or accessories, theft of a bicycle, theft from a vending machine, and all other types of thefts. 4 \"Other incidents\" include possession of a firearm or explosive device; possession of a knife or sharp object; distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs or alcohol; vandalism; and inappropriate distribution, possession, or use of prescription drugs.

SOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 2009-10 School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS), 2010. The percentage of schools that recorded incidents of violent crime, serious violent crime, theft, and other incidents varied by school characteristics. For example, by school level, primary schools recorded lower percentages of these types of crimes than middle schools and high schools: 64 percent of primary schools recorded violent incidents of crime compared with 91 percent each of middle schools and high schools (figure 6.2 and table 6.2). A lower percentage of primary schools recorded serious violent incidents of crime (13 percent) than middle or high schools (19 and 28 percent, respectively), a lower percentage of primary schools recorded incidents of theft (26 percent) than middle or high schools (65 and 83 percent, respectively), and a lower percentage of primary schools recorded other incidents (57 percent) than middle or high schools (82 and 92 percent, respectively). A similar pattern was observed for public schools that reported such incidents of violent crime, serious violent crime, theft, and other incidents to the police. The percentages of primary schools that reported incidents of these types of crime to the police were lower than for middle schools and high schools (figure  6.2 and table 6.3). Data on the number of crimes recorded and reported by schools in 2009-10 were categorized by frequency range as well. For example, 26 percent of schools  recorded zero violent crimes, and 19 percent of schools  recorded 20 or more violent crimes (figure 6.3 and  table 6.4). Sixty percent of schools did not report a violent crime to the police, while 5 percent of schools reported 20 or more violent crimes to the police. With regard to serious violent crimes, 84 percent of schools did not record a serious violent crime, and 2 percent of schools recorded 10 or more such crimes. Ninety percent of schools did not report a serious violent crime to the police, and 1 percent of schools reported 10 or more serious violent crimes to the police (table 6.5). The number of crimes recorded by schools by frequency range varied by school characteristics. A larger percentage of city schools recorded 20 or more violent incidents in 2009-10 than suburban schools or rural schools (table 6.4). In 2009-10, this amounts to about 25 percent of city schools recording 20 or more violent incidents, compared with 19 percent of suburban schools and 14 percent of rural schools. \nBullying at School and Cyber-Bullying Anywhere In 2011, about 28 percent of 12-to 18-year-old students reported being bullied at school, and 9 percent reported being cyber-bullied during the school year. Bullying 29 is now recognized as a widespread and often neglected problem in schools that has serious implications for victims of bullying and for those who perpetrate the bullying (Swearer et al. 2010). The School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey collects data on students ages 12-18 and their reports of being bullied at school 30 and being cyber-bullied anywhere during the school year. Cyber-bullying 31 is distinct from bullying at school. Survey items on cyber-bullying anywhere are asked separately from other survey items on bullying at school; however, the context for cyber-bullying may have developed at school. This indicator first discusses student reports of being bullied at school in 2011 by selected bullying problems and selected student and school characteristics. It then discusses student reports of being cyber-bullied anywhere in 2011 by selected cyber-bullying problems and selected student and school characteristics. In addition, findings on bullying at school over time are presented for 2005, 2007, 2009, and 2011. Prior data are excluded from the time series due to significant redesign of the bullying items in 2005. In 2011, about 28 percent of students ages 12-18 reported being bullied at school during the school year (figure 11.1 and table 11.1). Of those students who reported being bullied at school, 18 percent reported that they were made fun of, called names, or insulted. Eighteen percent of students reported 29 \"Bullying\" includes students who responded that another student had made fun of them, called them names, or insulted them; spread rumors about them; threatened them with harm; tried to make them do something they did not want to do; excluded them from activities on purpose; destroyed their property on purpose; or pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on them. 30 \"At school\" includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going to and from school. 31 \"Cyber-bullying\" includes students who responded that another student had posted hurtful information about them on the Internet; purposefully shared private information about them on the Internet; harassed them via instant messaging; harassed them via Short Message Service (SMS) text messaging; harassed them via e-mail; harassed them while gaming; or excluded them online. being the subject of rumors, 5 percent reported being threatened with harm, and 3 percent reported that others tried to make them do things they did not want to do. Six percent of students reported being excluded from activities on purpose, 3 percent reported that their property was destroyed by others on purpose, and 8 percent said they were pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on. In 2011, about 21 percent of students who were pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on at school during the school year reported being injured as a result of the incident. Students' reports of being bullied at school varied by student and school characteristics. In 2011, a higher percentage of females than of males ages 12-18 reported that they were made fun of, called names, or insulted (19 vs. 16 percent), were the subject of rumors (24 vs. 13 percent), and were excluded from activities on purpose (6 vs. 5 percent). The percentage of males (9 percent) who reported being pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on was higher than the percentage of females (7 percent) who reported being subjected to the same type of bullying."}, {"section_title": "Indicator 7 Discipline Problems Reported by Public Schools", "text": "During the 2009-10 school year, 23 percent of public schools reported that bullying occurred among students on a daily or weekly basis, 9 percent reported student acts of disrespect for teachers other than verbal abuse on a daily or weekly basis, and 5 percent reported that student verbal abuse of teachers occurred on a daily or weekly basis. Sixteen percent reported gang activities during the school year. In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public school principals were asked how often certain disciplinary problems happened in their schools. 22 This indicator examines the daily or weekly occurrence of student racial/ethnic tensions, bullying, sexual harassment of other students, sexual harassment of other students based on sexual orientation or gender identity, verbal abuse of teachers, acts of disrespect for teachers other than verbal abuse, and widespread disorder in the classroom. It also looks at occurrences of gang and cult or extremist group activities during the school year. In the 2009-10 survey administration, schools were also asked to report selected types of cyberbullying problems at school or away from school that occurred daily or weekly. During the 2009-10 school year, 23 percent of public schools reported that bullying occurred among students on a daily or weekly basis, and 9 percent reported student acts of disrespect for teachers other than verbal abuse on a daily or weekly basis (table 7.1). With regard to other discipline problems reported as occurring at least once a week, 5 percent of schools reported student verbal abuse of teachers, and 3 percent each of reported student racial/ethnic tensions, student sexual harassment of other students, sexual harassment of other students based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and widespread disorder in classrooms. Sixteen percent of public schools reported that gang activities had happened at all during the 2009-10 school year and 2 percent reported that cult or extremist activities had happened at all during this period. Discipline problems reported by public schools varied by school characteristics. In 2009-10, a higher percentage of city schools than rural schools and suburban schools reported various types of discipline problems (figure 7.1 and table 7.1). For example, 27 percent of city schools, compared with 21 percent of rural schools and 20 percent of suburban schools, reported that student bullying occurred at least once a week. A greater percentage of city schools (28 percent) than suburban schools and rural schools (15 and 9 percent, respectively) reported any occurrence of gang activities during the school year.

A higher percentage of students from urban schools (23 percent) reported a gang presence than students from suburban (16 percent) and rural schools (12 percent) in 2011. The percentage of students from urban schools who reported a gang presence decreased from 31 percent in 2009 to 23 percent in 2011. Gang activity in the vicinity of schools poses a risk to staff and student safety and to school security. Intimidation of staff and students by gang members has a large impact on the educational environment and perception of school safety (Smith et al. 2011). The School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey asked students ages 12-18 if gangs were present at their school during the school year. 25 In 2011, about 18 percent of students ages 12-18 reported that gangs were present at their school during the school year. This was a decrease from the 20 percent of students who reported a gang presence in 2009. In 2011, a higher percentage of students from urban areas (23 percent) reported a gang presence at their school than students from suburban and rural areas (16 percent and 12 percent, respectively; figure 8.1 and table 8.1). While the percentages of students from suburban areas and rural areas who reported a gang presence at their school did not measurably change between 2009 and 2011, the percentage of students from urban areas who reported a gang presence at their school decreased from 31 percent in 2009 to 23 percent in 2011. There were no measurable differences in the percentages of male and female students who reported a gang presence at their school (18 and 17 percent, respectively) in 2011. The percentage of female students who reported a gang presence did not measurably change between 2009 and 2011; however, the percentage of male students who reported a gang presence decreased from 21 percent in 2009 to 18 percent in 2011 (table 8.1). Approximately 19 percent of students attending public schools reported that gangs were present at their school, compared with 2 percent of students attending private schools in 2011. The percentage of private school students who reported a gang presence at their school was not measurably different between the two most recent survey years 2009 and 2011 (2 percent in each year). In contrast, the percentage of public school students who reported a gang presence decreased from 22 percent in 2009 to 19 percent in 2011. In 2011, a higher percentage of Black students (33 percent) than of Hispanic students (26 percent) reported the presence of gangs at their school. Also, higher percentages of Black students and Hispanic students than of White students (11 percent) and Asian students (10 percent) reported the presence of gangs at their schools. The percentage of White students who reported a gang presence decreased from 14 percent in 2009 to 11 percent in 2011. Similarly, the percentage of Hispanic students who reported a gang presence decreased from 33 percent in 2009 to 26 percent in 2011. However, the percentages of Black and Asian students who reported a gang presence were not measurably different between 2009 and 2011 (figure 8.2 and table 8.1). The percentages of students in 6th through 8th grade who reported a gang presence at their school were lower than the percentages for students in 9th through 12th grade in 2011.

This percentage represents a decrease from 1995, when 32 percent of students reported that illegal drugs were offered, sold, or given to them. In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades 9-12 were asked whether someone had offered, sold, or given them an illegal drug on school property in the 12 months preceding the survey. 26 The percentage of students in grades 9-12 who reported that drugs were made available to them on school property increased from 1993 to 1995 (from 24 to 32 percent), but then decreased to 26 percent in 2011 (table 9.1). There was no measurable difference in the percentages reported in 1993 and 2011. However, the percentage of students who reported that drugs were made available to them on school property in 2011 (26 percent) was higher than the percentage of students who reported that drugs were made available to them on school property in 2009 (23 percent; figure 9.1 and table 9.1). Student reports regarding the availability of illegal drugs on school property varied by student characteristics.

In 2011, a higher percentage of 10th-graders reported that illegal drugs were made available to them on school property than 9th-graders or 12th-graders; however, there were no other measurable differences across grades in the percentages of students reporting that illegal drugs were made available to them in 2011 (table 9.1). Twenty-four percent of 9th-graders and 12th-graders, as well as 27 percent of 11th-graders, and 28 percent of 10th-graders reported that drugs were made available to them that year. The percentage of students who reported having illegal drugs offered, sold, or given to them on school property differed across racial/ethnic groups (figure 9.2 and table 9.1). In 2011, higher percentages of American Indian/Alaska Native students (40 percent), Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian students (39 percent), and Hispanic students and students of two or more races (33 percent each), than White, Black, or Asian students (23 percent each) reported that illegal drugs were offered, sold, or given to them on school property. In 2011, public school student reports of the availability of illegal drugs on school property varied across the 43 states and jurisdictions for which data were available. Among these states, the percentage of students reporting that drugs were offered, sold, or given to them on school property ranged from 12 percent in Iowa to 35 percent in Arizona and New Mexico (table 9.2).   In 2011, about 9 percent of students ages 12-18 reported being the target of hate-related words at school during the school year and 28 percent of students reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school. The School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey collects data on students' reports of being the target of hate-related 27 words and seeing hate-related graffiti at school. 28 Specifically, in 2011, students ages 12-18 were asked whether someone at school had called them a derogatory word having to do with their race, ethnicity, religion, disability, gender, or sexual orientation. Students also were asked if they had seen hate-related graffiti at their school-that is, hate-related words or symbols written in classrooms, bathrooms, or hallways or on the outside of the school building. In 2011, about 9 percent of students ages 12-18 reported being the target of hate-related words at school during the school year (figure 10.1 and table 10.1). The percentage of students who reported being the target of hate-related words decreased from 12 percent in 2001 to 9 percent in 2011; however, there was no measurable difference between the percentages in the two most recent survey years 2009 and 2011 (9 percent in both years). Twenty-eight percent of students reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school during the school year in 2011. The percentage of students who reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school decreased from 36 percent in 1999 to 28 percent in 2011, but there was no measurable difference between the percentages in the two most recent survey years 2009 and 2011 (29 and 28 percent, respectively). As was the case in all survey years since 2001, no measurable differences were observed in 2011 in the percentages of males and females who reported being called a hate-related word or who reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school during the school year. The percentage of male students who reported being called a hate-related word did not measurably change between 2009 and 2011; however, the percentage of male students who reported being called a hate-related word was lower in 2011 (9 percent) than in 2001 (13 percent). In addition, the percentage of female students who reported being called a hate-related word did not measurably change between 2009 and 2011, but it was lower in 2011 (9 percent) than in 2001 (12 percent). Similarly, the percentage of male students who reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school did not measurably change between 2009 and 2011, but it was lower in 2011 (29 percent) than in 1999 (34 percent). Also, the percentage of female students who reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school did not measurably change between 2009 and 2011, but it was also lower in 2011 (28 percent) than in 1999 (39 percent). In 2011, there were no measurable differences in the percentages of students who reported being called hate-related words or who reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school by race/ethnicity (figure 10.1 and table 10.1). Eight percent of White students, 9 percent of Asian students, 10 percent of Hispanic students, and 11 percent of Black students reported being called a hate-related word. Twenty-eight percent each of Black and White students, 29 percent of Hispanic students and, 30 percent of Asian students reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school. Indicator 10 continued on page 44. Some measurable differences were observed across grades in students' reports of seeing hate-related graffiti at school in 2011. For example, a lower percentage of 6th-, 7th-, 8th-, and 12th-graders (26 percent each) reported seeing hate-related graffiti in 2011, compared with 32 percent of 11th-graders and 33 percent of 10th-graders (table 10.1). There were no measurable differences observed across grades in students' reports of being called a hate-related word at school. By school sector, the percentage of public school students who reported being called a hate-related word (9 percent) was not measurably different from the percentage of private school students (7 percent) in 2011. In each data collection year between 1999 and 2011, a higher percentage of public school students than private school students reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school. For instance, in 2011, approximately 30 percent of public school students reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school compared with 13 percent of private school students. Students who reported being the target of hate-related words at school in 2011 were asked to indicate whether the derogatory word they were called was related to their race, ethnicity, religion, disability, gender, or sexual orientation (figure 10.2 and table 10.2). A higher percentage of male students than female students reported being called a hate-related word with regard to their race (5 percent vs. 4 percent). In turn, a higher percentage of female students than male students reported being called a hate-related word with regard to their gender (2 percent vs. 1 percent). With respect to being called a hate-related word related to their race, White students reported being the target at a lower percentage than their peers. Specifically, 2 percent of White students reported being called a hate-related word with regard to their race, compared with 7 percent each of Black, Asian, and Hispanic students, and 8 percent of students of other races. In addition, among students who reported being called a hate-related word with regard to their ethnicity, a higher percentage of Hispanic students (7 percent) reported being the target than their White, Black, or Other race/ethnicity peers (between 1 and 4 percent of students). In the School Crime Supplement (SCS) questionnaire, students were asked if they had been the target of hate-related words at school. Students who indicated that they had been called a hate-related word were asked to choose the specific characteristics that the hate-related word targeted. Students were allowed to choose more than one characteristic. If a student chose more than one characteristic, he or she is counted once under the \"total\" category. Therefore, the total percentage of students who reported being called a hate-related word is less than the sum of the students' individual characteristics. NOTE: \"At school\" includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and going to and from school. \"Hate-related\" refers to derogatory terms used by others in reference to students' personal characteristics.

Specifically, 15 percent of Asian students ages 12-18 reported being bullied at school during the school year, compared with 31 percent of White students, 27 percent of Black students, and 22 percent of Hispanic students. Nine percent of Asian students reported being made fun of, called names, or insulted, compared with 21 percent of White students and 16 percent of Black students. Similarly, 8 percent of Asian students reported that they had been the subject of rumors, compared with 20 percent of White students, 19 percent of Black students, and 15 percent of Hispanic students. A higher percentage of students in 6th grade than of students in grades 7 through 12 reported being bullied at school during the school year. In 2011, about 37 percent of 6th-graders reported being bullied at school, compared with 30 percent of 7th-graders, 31 percent of 8th-graders, 26 percent of 9th-graders, 28 percent of 10th-graders, 24 percent of 11thgraders, and 22 percent of 12th-graders. By school sector, a higher percentage of public school students than of private school students reported being bullied and being subjects of selected bullying problems at school in 2011. Twenty-eight percent of public school students reported being bullied at school, compared with 21 percent of private school students. Higher percentages of public school students than of private school students also reported that they were made fun of, called names, or insulted (18 vs. 14 percent), were the subject of rumors (19 vs. 13 percent), were threatened with harm (5 vs. 2 percent), and were pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on (8 vs. 5 percent). Additionally, there were differences by urbanicity: a lower percentage of students in urban areas (25 percent) reported being bullied at school than students in suburban and rural areas in 2011 (29 and 30 percent, respectively). The School Crime Supplement asked students ages 12-18 who reported being bullied at school to indicate the location at which they had been victimized. In 2011, of students who reported being bullied, about 46 percent of students reported that the bullying occurred in the hallway or stairwell at school during the school year (figure 11.2 and table 11.2). In addition, 33 percent reported being bullied inside the classroom, and 22 percent reported being bullied outside on school grounds. Eleven percent reported being bullied in the bathroom or locker room, 9 percent reported being bullied in the cafeteria, 7 percent reported being bullied on the school bus, and 2 percent reported being bullied somewhere else in school. For the most part, the percentages of students who reported being bullied in various locations did not differ by student or school characteristics. In 2011, approximately 9 percent of students ages 12-18 reported being cyber-bullied anywhere during the school year (figure 11.3 and table 11.3). Four percent of students reported that another student had posted hurtful information on the Internet and 4 percent reported being subject to harassing text messages. Three percent of students reported being subject to harassing instant messages, 2 percent reported being subject to harassing e-mails, and 1 percent each reported having their private information purposefully shared on the Internet, being harassed while gaming, and being excluded online. With the exception of being the subject of harassment while gaming and being excluded online, female students ages 12-18 reported being the victims of all other types of cyber-bullying problems at higher percentages than males in 2011. For example, 6 percent of females versus 2 percent of males reported that another student posted hurtful information about them on the Internet, and the same percentages of females and males, respectively, reported being the subject of harassing text messages. However, 3 percent of male students reported being harassed while gaming, compared with less than one-half of 1 percent of female students. There were also some differences in the prevalence of students reporting cyber-bullying anywhere during the school year by students' race/ethnicity, grade level, and urbanicity. The percentage of students who reported being cyber-bullied was higher for White students (11 percent) than for Hispanic (8 percent) or Black (7 percent) students. A higher percentage of students in 10th grade (12 percent) reported being cyber-bullied than of students in 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 12th grade (between 6 and 9 percent each). Also, the percentage of students in urban areas reporting cyber-bullying overall was lower than students in suburban areas (7 and 10 percent, respectively). In 2011, about 36 percent of students who reported bullying problems at school indicated that they occurred at least once or twice a month 32 during the school year (figure 11.4 and table 11.4). Among those 32 Students who reported being bullied or cyber-bullied at least once or twice a month includes students who reported that they had been bullied (or cyber-bullied) \"almost every day,\" \"once or twice a week,\" and \"once or twice a month.\" students who reported being bullied, there were no measurable differences between males and females in the frequency of their being bullied. Twenty-eight percent of students who reported cyber-bullying problems anywhere indicated that these problems occurred at least once or twice a month during the school year. In general, for students who reported being cyber-bullied, greater percentages of males than of females reported frequencies of cyber-bullying of once or twice a month or more often. For example, 26 percent of males and 16 percent of females were cyber-bullied once or twice a month, and 9 percent of males and 3 percent of females were cyber-bullied once or twice a week. On the other hand, a greater percentage of females (79 percent) than of males (60 percent) reported being cyber-bullied once or twice in the school year. Students who reported being bullied also were asked if they had notified an adult. In 2011, a higher percentage of students reported notifying an adult after being bullied at school than after being cyberbullied anywhere (40 vs. 26 percent). While there was no measurable difference by sex in the percentage of students notifying an adult after being bullied at school, a higher percentage of females (32 percent) than of males (16 percent) reported notifying an adult after being cyber-bullied. Higher percentages of students in grades 6 through 9 reported notifying an adult after being bullied at school than did students in grades 10 through 12; generally, higher percentages of 6th-through 9th-graders than of 11th-and 12thgraders notified an adult about cyber-bullying.  1 Teacher or other adult at school notified. 2 \"Cyber-bullying\" includes students who responded that another student had posted hurtful information about them on the Internet; purposefully shared private information about them on the Internet; harassed them via instant messaging; harassed them via Short Message Service (SMS) text messaging; harassed them via e-mail; harassed them while gaming; or excluded them online.

Students' reports of being bullied at school varied over time (figure 11.5 and table 11.5). While no linear trend was observed between 2005 and 2011, a higher percentage of students reported being bullied in 2007 (32 percent) than in 2005, 2009, and 2011 (28 percent in each year). For many of the school characteristics examined, the percentages of students who reported being bullied at school in 2011 were lower than in 2007. For example, in 2011 the percentage of public school students who reported being bullied at school (28 percent) and the percentage of private school students who reported being bullied at school (21 percent) were lower than in 2007, when 32 percent of public school students and 29 percent of private school students reported being bullied at school. Also, lower percentages of students from urban and rural areas reported being bullied in 2011 than in 2007. Categories include \"central city of an MSA (Urban),\" \"in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),\" and \"not MSA (Rural).\" These data by metropolitan status were based on the location of households and differ from those published in Student Reports of Bullying and Cyber-Bullying: Results From the 2011 School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey, which were based on the urban-centric measure of the location of the school that the child attended. 2 Sector of school as reported by the respondent.

Managing inappropriate behaviors and classroom disruptions is time-consuming and takes away from valuable instructional time and student engagement in academic behaviors (Riley, McKevitt, Shriver, and Allen 2011). In the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), public and private school teachers were asked whether student misbehavior and student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching. During the 2011-12 school year, 38 percent of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that student misbehavior interfered with their teaching, and 35 percent reported that student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching (figure 12.1 and table 12.1). Teachers were also asked whether school rules were enforced by other teachers at their school, even for students not in their classes, and whether school rules were enforced by the principal. In 2011-12, about 69 percent of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that other teachers at their school enforced the school rules, and 84 percent reported that the principal enforced the school rules (figure 12.1 and table 12.2). The percentages of teachers who reported that student misbehavior and student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching varied by school characteristics during the 2011-12 school year (table 12.1).

In the question that asks students about physical fights at school, \"on school property\" was not defined for survey respondents.   The presence of weapons at school may interfere with teaching and learning by creating an intimidating and threatening atmosphere (Aspy et al. 2004). In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), students were asked if they had carried a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club anywhere in the previous 30 days and if they had carried such a weapon on school property during the same time period. 34 Weapon carrying \"anywhere\" is included as a point of comparison with weapon carrying on school property. In a different survey, the School Crime Supplement (SCS), students were asked if they could have gotten a loaded gun without adult permission, either at school or away from school, during the current school year. This indicator discusses YRBS data first and concludes with a discussion of students' access to firearms at school or away from school, using data from the SCS. Readers should note the differing data sources and terminology. In 2011, some 17 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported that they had carried a weapon anywhere on at least 1 day during the previous 30 days: 8 percent carried a weapon anywhere on 6 or more days, 6 percent carried a weapon on 2 to 5 days, and 3 percent carried a weapon on 1 day (tables 14.1 and 14.2). In comparison, 5 percent of students reported carrying a weapon on school property during the previous 30 days. This percentage was composed of 2 percent of students who carried a weapon on 6 or more days, 1 percent who carried a weapon on 2 to 5 days, and 2 percent who carried a weapon on 1 day. The percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere in the previous 30 days declined from 22 percent in 1993 to 17 percent in 2011, and the percentage who reported carrying a weapon on school property declined from 12 percent in 1993 to 5 34 The term \"anywhere\" is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students are simply asked how many days they carried a weapon during the past 30 days.

There was no measurable difference, however, between the 2009 and 2011 percentages of students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere, nor was there a measurable difference between the 2009 and 2011 percentages of students who reported carrying a weapon on school property. In every survey year from 1993 to 2011, a higher percentage of males than females reported that they had carried a weapon, both anywhere and on school property (figure 14.1 and table 14.1). In 2011, for example, 26 percent of males carried a weapon anywhere, compared to 7 percent of females, and 8 percent of males carried a weapon on school property, compared to 2 percent of females. In 2011, a smaller percentage of Asian students than students of any other racial/ethnic group reported carrying a weapon anywhere in the previous 30 days (figure 14.2 and table 14.1). Nine percent of Asian students reported carrying a weapon anywhere in the previous 30 days, compared with 14 percent of Black students, 16 percent of Hispanic students, 17 percent of White students, 21 percent of Pacific Islander/ Native Hawaiian students, 24 percent of students of two or more races, and 28 percent of American Indian/Alaska Native students. In addition, the percentages of White, Black, and Hispanic students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere in the previous 30 days were lower than the percentages for American Indian/Alaska Native students and students of two or more races. The percentage of students who reported they had carried a weapon on school property over the previous 30 days ranged from 4 to 11 percent across racial/ethnic groups in 2011; however, there were no measurable differences between these groups.  NOTE: The term \"anywhere\" is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students are simply asked how many days they carried a weapon during the past 30 days. In the question that asks students about carrying a weapon at school, \"on school property\" was not defined for survey respondents.   There were no measurable differences between the percentages of students at each of the grade levels 9 through 12 who reported carrying a weapon anywhere during the previous 30 days. In 2011, about 16 percent each of 11th-graders and 12th-graders, and 17 percent each of 9th-graders and 10th-graders reported carrying a weapon anywhere during the previous 30 days. Similarly, the percentages of students who reported carrying a weapon on school property during the previous 30 days did not differ measurably by grade level: 5 percent each of 9thgraders and 11th-graders and 6 percent each of 10th-graders and 12th-graders reported carrying a weapon on school property in 2011. In 2011, state-level data on percentages of public school students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere were available for 37 states and the District of Columbia, and state-level data on percentages of students who reported carrying a weapon on school property were available for 39 states and the District of Columbia (table 14.3). Among these states, the percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere ranged from 10 percent in New Jersey and Wisconsin to 27 percent in Wyoming, while the percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon on school property ranged from 3 percent in Wisconsin to 11 percent in Wyoming. Information about students' access to firearms can put student reports of carrying a gun anywhere and on school property into context. , and 2011 SCS surveys provide data on the percentage of students ages 12-18 who reported having access to a loaded gun without adult permission, either at school or away from school, during the school year. In 2011, about 5 percent of students ages 12-18 reported having access to a loaded gun during the school year (table 14.4). In 2011, lower percentages of students in grades 7 and 8 reported having access to a gun without adult permission than students in grades 10, 11, and 12. Three percent each of 7th-and 8th-grade students reported having access to a gun, compared with 5 percent of 10th-graders, 6 percent of 11th-graders, and 8 percent of 12th-graders. The percentage of 12th-graders reporting that they had access to a gun (8 percent) was also higher than that of 9th-graders (4 percent) and 10th-graders (5 percent). The percentage of students reporting that they had access to a gun without adult permission was lower in 2009 and 2011 (6 percent and 5 percent, respectively) than it was in 2007 (7 percent). In all three survey years, a higher percentage of male students than female students reported having access to a gun. For example, in 2011, about 6 percent of males reported having access to a gun, compared with 4 percent of females. This page intentionally left blank. In 2011, about 39 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported having at least one drink of alcohol anywhere during the previous 30 days, and 5 percent had at least one drink on school property. Among female students, the percentage who reported consuming alcohol anywhere decreased from 2009 to 2011, while the percentage who reported consuming alcohol on school property increased. Alcohol consumption on school property is an illegal behavior of students, which may lead to additional crimes and misbehavior (Kodjo, Auinger, and Ryan 2003). In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades 9-12 were asked if they had consumed alcohol anywhere during the previous 30 days and if they had consumed alcohol on school property during the same time period. 35 Consuming alcohol \"anywhere\" in this indicator is included as a point of comparison with consuming alcohol on school property. In most states, purchase or public possession of alcohol anywhere by students in grades 9-12 is illegal, since most students are under the state's minimum legal drinking age. Overall, the percentage of students who reported consuming alcohol anywhere during the previous 30 days decreased from 48 percent in 1993 to 39 percent in 2011. The percentage of students who reported consuming alcohol on school property in the previous 30 days in 2011 was not measurably different from the 1993 percentage (5 percent each; figure 15.1 and table 15.1). In 2011, about 19 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported using alcohol anywhere on 1 or 2 days during the previous 30 days (table 15.2). Eighteen percent reported using alcohol anywhere on 3 to 29 of the previous 30 days, and one percent reported using alcohol anywhere on all of the previous 30 days. In addition, 3 percent of students reported using alcohol on school property on 1 or 2 of the previous 30 days, 1 percent of students reported using alcohol on school property on 3 to 29 of the previous 30 days, and one-half percent of students reported using alcohol on school property on all of the previous 30 days. In the survey years since 2003, there have been no measurable differences between the percentages of male and female students who reported consuming alcohol anywhere on at least one of the previous 30 35 The term \"anywhere\" is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students are simply asked how many days during the previous 30 days they had at least one drink of alcohol. In the question that asks students about drinking alcohol at school, \"on school property\" was not defined for survey respondents. In every survey year between 1993 and 2009, a higher percentage of males than females reported using alcohol on school property (figure 15.1 and table 15.1). However, in 2011 there was no measurable difference between the percentages of male and female students reporting consuming alcohol at least one day on school property (5 percent each). In 2011, a higher percentage of male than female students reported consuming alcohol on school property on all of the previous 30 days (1 percent vs. less than one-half percent). From 2009 to 2011, there was no measurable change in the percentages of male students who reported alcohol consumption anywhere or on school property. Among females, however, the percentage of students who reported alcohol consumption anywhere decreased from 43 percent in 2009 to 38 percent in 2011, and the percentage of female students who reported alcohol consumption on school property increased from 4 to 5 percent over the same time period (figure 15.1 and table 15.1). In 2011, about 48 percent of 12th-graders reported consuming alcohol anywhere at least one day during the previous 30 days (figure 15.3 and table 15.1). This percentage was higher than the 2011 percentages for 9th-graders (30 percent), 10th-graders (36 percent), and 11th-graders (43 percent). In addition, a higher percentage of 12th-graders (27 percent) than 9thgraders (11 percent)  NOTE: The term \"anywhere\" is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students are simply asked how many days during the previous 30 days they had at least one drink of alcohol. In the question that asks students about drinking alcohol at school, \"on school property\" was not defined for survey respondents. Alcohol consumption anywhere and on school property varied by racial/ethnic group. In 2011, higher percentages of White (40 percent), Hispanic (42 percent), and American Indian/Alaska Native students (45 percent) than Asian (26 percent) or Black students (30 percent) reported consuming alcohol anywhere at least one day during the previous 30 days (figure 15.4 and table 15.1). On school property, higher percentages of American Indian/Alaska Native (21 percent) and Hispanic students (7 percent) reported alcohol consumption than Asian students (3 percent), White students (4 percent), and Black students (5 percent). In 2011, state-level data on percentages of students who reported using alcohol anywhere were available for 43 states and the District of Columbia, and statelevel data on percentages of students who reported drinking alcohol on school property were available for 37 states and the District of Columbia (table  15.3). The percentage of students who reported drinking alcohol anywhere and on school property varied among the states for which data were available. Among these states, the percentages of students who reported drinking alcohol anywhere at least one day during the previous 30 days ranged from 15 percent in Utah to 44 percent in Arizona and Louisiana, while the percentage of students who reported drinking on school property ranged from 2 percent in Indiana and Iowa to 7 percent in the District of Columbia.

In the question that asks students about drinking alcohol at school, \"on school property\" was not defined for survey respondents. In 2011, some 23 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported using marijuana anywhere at least one time in the previous 30 days, and 6 percent reported using marijuana at least one time on school property over the same time period. The Youth Risk Behavior Survey asked students in grades 9-12 whether they had used marijuana anywhere in the previous 30 days, as well as whether they had used marijuana on school property during that time. 36 In 2011, some 23 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported using marijuana anywhere at least one time in the previous 30 days, and 6 percent reported using marijuana at least one time on school property over the same time period. The percentage of students who reported using marijuana anywhere was higher in 2011 than it was in 1993 (23 vs. 18 percent); however, there was no measurable difference between the 2011 and 1993 percentages of students who reported using marijuana on school property (6 percent in both years; figure 16.1 and table 16.1). In addition, the 2011 percentages of students who reported using marijuana anywhere and on school property were higher than the 2009 percentages. In 2009, about 21 percent of students reported using marijuana anywhere in the previous 30 days, and 5 percent reported using marijuana on school property in the previous 30 days. In every survey year, higher percentages of males than females reported using marijuana anywhere and on school property at least one time in the previous 30 days (figure 16.1 and table 16.1). For example, in 2011 about 26 percent of males reported using marijuana at least once anywhere in the previous 30 days, compared with 20 percent of females. Eight percent of male students reported that they used marijuana on school property in 2011, compared with 4 percent of female students. There were also differences between the percentages of males and females who reported using marijuana 40 or more times in the previous 30 days in 2011 (figure 16.2 and table 16.2): 7 percent of males reported using marijuana 40 or more times anywhere in the previous 30 days, compared with 2 36 The term \"anywhere\" is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students are simply asked how many times during the previous 30 days they used marijuana.

In 2011, the percentage of Asian students who reported using marijuana anywhere at least one time in the previous 30 days was lower than the percentages for other racial/ethnic groups (figure 16.3 and table 16.1). Fourteen percent of Asian students reported using marijuana anywhere, compared with 22 percent of White students; 24 percent of Hispanic students; 25 percent of Black students; 27 percent of students of two or more races; 31 percent of Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian students; and 47 percent of American Indian/Alaska Native students. In the same year, a higher percentage of American Indian/Alaska Native students reported having used marijuana on school property at least one time in the previous 30 days than most other racial/ethnic groups. Additionally, a higher percentage of Hispanic students than White or Asian students reported having used marijuana on school property, and a higher percentage of Black students than White students reported having done so. In 2011, a smaller percentage of 9th-graders (18 percent) than 10th-graders (22 percent), 11th-graders (26 percent), or 12th-graders (28 percent) reported using marijuana anywhere, and a lower percentage of 10th-graders than 11th-or 12th-graders reported doing so (figure 16.4 and table 16.1). There were no measurable differences between the percentages of students in any of grades 9-12 who reported the use of marijuana on school property in 2011. Indicator 16 continued on page 72.

Among these states, the percentages of students who reported using marijuana anywhere ranged from 10 percent in Utah to 28 percent in Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and New Mexico. The percentage of students who reported using marijuana on school property ranged from 2 percent in Oklahoma to 10 percent in New Mexico. ! Interpret data with caution.

"}, {"section_title": "Indicator 17 Students' Perceptions of Personal Safety at School and Away From School", "text": "In 2011, a higher percentage of students ages 12-18 reported that they were afraid of attack or harm at school (4 percent) than away from school (2 percent) during the school year. School violence can make students fearful and affect their readiness and ability to learn, and concerns about vulnerability to attacks can detract from a positive school environment (Scheckner et al. 2002). In the School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12-18 were asked how often 37 they had been afraid of attack or harm \"at school or on the way to and from school\" as well as \"away from school.\" 38 In 2011, a higher percentage of students ages 12-18 reported that they were afraid of attack or harm at school (4 percent) than away from school (2 percent) during the school year (figure 17.1 and table 17.1). In 2011, a lower percentage of White students (3 percent) than of Hispanic students (5 percent) reported being afraid of attack or harm at school, and a lower percentage of White students (2 percent) than of Black and Hispanic students (3 percent each) reported being afraid of attack or harm away from school. The percentage of students who reported being afraid of attack or harm at school or away from school in 2011 did not measurably differ by sex. Four percent each of female and male students reported being afraid of attack or harm at school, and 3 percent of females and 2 percent of males reported being afraid of attack or harm away from school. The percentages of students who reported being afraid of attack or harm at school or away from school in 2011 tended to be greater for students in lower grades than for those in upper grades. For example, higher percentages of 6th-graders (6 percent), 7th-graders (4 percent), 8th-graders (5 percent), and 9th-graders (4 percent) reported being afraid of attack or harm at school than 11th-graders and 12th-graders (2 percent each). The percentage of 10th-graders (4 percent) who reported being afraid of attack or harm at school was also higher than the percentage of 11th-graders. Away from school, higher percentages of 6th-, 7th-, 9th-, and 11th-graders (3 to 4 percent each) reported being afraid of attack or harm than 12th-graders (1 percent). The percentage of 9th-graders (4 percent) who reported being afraid of attack or harm away from school was also higher than the percentage of 10th-graders (2 percent). Both at school and away from school, higher percentages of students in urban areas reported being afraid of attack or harm than students in suburban and rural areas. Specifically, 5 percent of students in urban areas reported being afraid of attack or harm at school, compared with 3 percent each of students in rural areas and suburban areas. Three percent of students in urban areas reported being afraid of attack or harm away from school, compared with 2 percent of students in suburban areas and 1 percent of those in rural areas. In 2011, a higher percentage of students in public schools (4 percent) than of students in private schools (2 percent) reported being afraid of attack or harm at school. Between 1995 and 2011, the percentage of students who reported being afraid of attack or harm at school decreased from 12 to 4 percent (figure 17.2). A declining trend was also observed away from school: between 1999 and 2011, the percentage of students who reported being afraid of attack or harm decreased from 6 to 2 percent. From 2009 to 2011, no measurable differences were found in the percentage of students who feared attack or harm at school; however, the percentage of students who feared attack or harm away from school was lower in 2011 (2 percent) than in 2009 (3 percent).  In 2011, about 6 percent of students ages 12-18 reported that they avoided school activities or one or more places in school because they thought someone might attack or harm them. School crime may lead students to perceive school as unsafe, and in trying to ensure their own safety, students may skip school activities or avoid certain places in school (Schreck and Miller 2003). To measure students' perception of safety, the School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey asks students ages 12-18 whether they avoided school activities or one or more places in school because they were fearful that someone might attack or harm them. 39 In 2011, about 6 percent of students reported that they avoided at least one school activity or one or more places in school during the previous school year because they feared being attacked or harmed. Specifically, 2 percent avoided at least one school activity, and 5 percent avoided one or more places in school 40 (figure 18.1 and table 18.1). There was no overall pattern of increase or decrease between 1999 and 2011 in the percentage of students who reported that they avoided at least one school activity or one or more places in school because of fear of attack or harm, and the percentage of students who reported this avoidance in 2011 (6 percent) was not measurably different from that in 2009 (5 percent). In 2011, about 1 percent each of students reported that they avoided any activities, avoided any classes, and stayed home from school. By school building location, 2 percent each of students reported that they avoided the hallways or stairs, parts of the school cafeteria, and any school restrooms; 1 percent each reported that they avoided the entrance to the school and other places inside the school building. Students' reports of avoiding one or more places in school because of fear of attack or harm varied by student characteristics in 2011 (figure 18.2). A higher percentage of Hispanic students (6 percent) than White students (4 percent), Asian students (3 percent), and \"other\" race/ethnicity students (3 percent) reported avoiding one or more places in school. By grade, a higher percentage of 6th-graders (7 percent) than 9th-graders, 11th-graders, or 12thgraders (4 percent each) reported avoiding one or more places in school. Also, a higher percentage of female than male students (5 vs. 4 percent) reported avoiding one or more places in school. In 2011, students' reports of avoiding one or more places in school also varied by urbanicity. A higher percentage of students in urban areas (5 percent) than in rural areas (4 percent) reported avoiding one of more places in school. Also, there were differences by school sector: a higher percentage of students in public schools (5 percent) than in private schools (2 percent) reported avoiding one or more places in school. NOTE: \"Avoided school activities\" includes avoiding any (extracurricular) activities, skipping class, or staying home from school. \"Avoided one or more places in school\" includes avoiding the entrance, any hallways or stairs, parts of the cafeteria, restrooms, and other places inside the school building.

A total of 433,800 serious disciplinary actions were taken by public schools during this period. In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public school principals were asked to report the number of disciplinary actions their schools had taken against students for specific offenses. The student offenses were physical attacks or fights; distribution, possession, or use of alcohol; distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs; use or possession of a firearm or explosive device; and use or possession of a weapon other than a firearm or explosive device. During the 2009-10 school year, 39 percent of public schools (32,300 schools) took at least one serious disciplinary action-including suspensions lasting 5 days or more, removals with no services for the remainder of the school year (i.e., expulsions), and transfers to specialized schools-for specific offenses (table 19."}, {"section_title": "1).", "text": "Out of all offenses reported, physical attacks or fights prompted the largest percentage of schools (29 percent) to respond with at least one serious disciplinary action (figure 19.1 and table 19.1). In response to other offenses by students, 20 percent of schools reported that they took disciplinary action for the distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs; 13 percent took action for the use or possession of a weapon other than a firearm or explosive device; 9 percent did so for the distribution, possession, or use of alcohol; and 3 percent did so for the use or possession of a firearm or explosive device. No linear trends were detected in the percentages of schools that took at least one serious disciplinary action for any of the reported offenses over time between 2003-04 and 2009-10, although the percentage of schools taking at least one serious disciplinary action for physical attacks or fights declined between 1999-2000 (35 percent) and 2009-10 (29 percent). During the 2009-10 school year, the percentage of public schools that took serious disciplinary actions increased with school level. A higher percentage of high schools (83 percent) took at least one serious disciplinary action than did middle schools (67 percent) and primary schools (18 percent). Combined schools (schools that provide instruction at both elementary and secondary grades) took at least one serious disciplinary action at a higher percentage (49 percent) than primary schools, but at a lower percentage than either middle schools or high schools. This pattern by school level was generally observed for disciplinary actions taken in response to specific offenses as well. For example, 66 percent of high schools took serious disciplinary actions in response to distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs, compared with 37 percent of middle schools, 23 percent of combined schools, and 2 percent of primary schools. A total of 433,800 serious disciplinary actions were taken by public schools during the 2009-10 school year for specific offenses. Most of these reported disciplinary actions were taken in response to physical attacks or fights (265,100 actions). The number of disciplinary actions taken in response to the use or possession of a firearm or explosive device (5,800 actions) was smaller than for other offenses reported.

In the 2009-10 school year, 43 percent of schools reported the presence of one or more security staff at their school at least once a week during the school year. Schools use a variety of practices and procedures to promote the safety of students and staff. In the Schools and Staffing Survey, principals of public and private schools were asked about their schools' use of safety and security measures and procedures. Certain practices, such as locking or monitoring doors or gates, are intended to limit or control access to school campuses, while others, such as the use of metal detectors and security cameras, are intended to monitor or restrict students' and visitors' behavior on campus. Another measure of safety and security, collected in the School Survey on Crime and Safety, is the presence of full-time and part-time security staff in public schools during the school year. In the 2011-12 school year, 88 percent of public schools reported that they controlled access to school buildings by locking or monitoring doors during school hours (table 20.1). Other safety and security measures frequently reported by public schools included the use of security cameras to monitor the school (64 percent) and the enforcement of a strict dress code (49 percent) (figure 20.1). In addition, 44 percent of public schools reported that they controlled access to school grounds by locking or monitoring gates during school hours, 24 percent reported the use of random dog sniffs to check for drugs, and 19 percent required that students wear uniforms. In general, higher percentages of public than of private schools reported the use of various safety and security measures in the 2011-12 school year (table 20.1). For example, higher percentages of public than of private schools reported the use of security cameras (64 vs. 41 percent) and random dog sniffs to check for drugs (24 vs. 4 percent). Higher percentages of public than of private schools also reported the following measures: controlling access to school buildings during school hours; requiring that students wear badges or picture IDs; requiring that book bags be clear or banning them from school; conducting metal detector checks on students (including both random and daily checks); and conducting random sweeps for contraband. 41 However, higher percentages of private than of public schools enforced a strict dress code (71 vs. 49 percent) and required that students wear uniforms (57 vs. 19 percent). 41 For example, drugs or weapons. Does not include dog sniffs. Indicator 20 continued on page 88.  In the 2011-12 school year, higher percentages of public secondary schools or combined schools than of elementary schools reported using the following safety and security measures: enforcing a strict dress code; requiring that students wear badges or picture IDs; requiring that book bags be clear or banning them from school; conducting metal detector checks on students (including both random and daily checks); using random dog sniffs to check for drugs; conducting random sweeps for contraband; 42 and using security cameras to monitor the school (table 20.1). For example, among public schools, 81 percent of secondary schools, 72 percent of combined schools, and 58 percent of elementary schools reported the use of security cameras to monitor the school (table 20.1). In addition, the percentage of public secondary schools who reported using random dog sniffs for drugs (57 percent) was higher than the percentages of combined schools (41 percent) and elementary schools (11 percent) with such a procedure in place. However, lower percentages of public secondary schools (84 percent) and combined schools (83 percent) than of elementary schools (90 percent) reported controlling access to buildings during school hours. Also, the percentage of public secondary schools who reported requiring that students wear uniforms (12 percent) was lower than the percentages of elementary schools (20 percent) and combined schools (30 percent) with such a requirement. The use of safety and security measures in the 2011-12 school year also varied by public school locale (table 20.2). Higher percentages of public city schools than of public schools in suburban, town, and rural areas reported the following measures: controlling access to school grounds during school hours; requiring that students wear uniforms; enforcing a strict dress code; requiring that students wear badges or picture IDs; and conducting metal detector checks on students (including both random and daily checks). For example, 55 percent of public city schools reported controlling access to school grounds, compared with 46 percent of suburban schools and 37 percent each of public schools in towns and rural areas. However, public city schools had the lowest reported percentage of schools with security cameras (59 percent of city schools vs. between 65 and 67 percent of rural, suburban, and town schools). In addition, higher percentages of public town and rural schools than of city and suburban schools reported the use of random dog sniffs for drugs and random sweeps for contraband. Many safety and security measures tended to be more prevalent in high-poverty public schools (where 76 percent or more of students are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch) than in low-poverty schools (where 25 percent or less of students are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch) during the 2011-12 school year (table 20.2). Higher percentages of highpoverty public schools than of low-poverty schools reported controlling access to school grounds during school hours; requiring that students wear uniforms; enforcing a strict dress code; requiring that students wear badges or picture IDs; requiring that book bags be clear or banning them from school; conducting metal detector checks on students (including both random and daily checks); and conducting sweeps for contraband. 42 For instance, 64 percent of high-poverty public schools reported enforcing a strict dress code, compared with 38 percent of lowpoverty schools. Also, 47 percent of high-poverty public schools reported requiring school uniforms, compared to 6 percent of low poverty public schools. Indicator 20 continued on page 90.  The percentages of public schools reporting the use of various safety and security measures in 2011-12 tended to be higher or not measurably different from the percentages reported in 2003-04 (figure 20.2 and table 20.1). For example, the percentage of public schools reporting that they required that students wear uniforms increased from 13 to 19 percent between the 2003-04 and 2011-12 school years. Public schools' reported use of security cameras to monitor the school increased from 2003-04 (32 percent) to 2011-12 (64 percent). Also, the percentage of public schools reporting that they controlled access to buildings during school hours was higher in 2011-12 than in 2003-04 (88 vs. 82 percent). A similar pattern was observed for controlled access to grounds during school hours (44 percent in 2011-12 vs. 39 percent in 2003-04). In the 2009-10 school year, 43 percent of public schools reported the presence of one or more security guards, security personnel, School Resource Officers, or sworn law enforcement officers at their school at least once a week during the school year (table  20.3). 43 The percentage of public schools reporting the presence of security staff did not measurably differ between 2005-06 (42 percent) and 2009-10 (43 percent); however, the percentage of public schools reporting the presence of security staff was higher in 2007-08 (46 percent) than in either 2005-06 or 2009-10. Twenty-nine percent of public schools reported having at least one full-time employed security staff who was present at least once a week, and 14 percent of public schools reported having only part-time staff. A lower percentage of public schools reported full-time security staff at their school in 2005-06 (27 percent) than in 2007-08 (30 percent), while there were no measurable differences between each of these percentages and the percentage reported in 2009-10 (29 percent). No measurable differences were found across years for the percentages of public schools reporting part-time only security staff. About 28 percent of public primary schools reported the presence of one or more security staff at their school at least once a week in 2009-10. The percentage of public primary schools reporting security staff was lower than the percentages of middle schools and high schools reporting the presence of security staff (66 and 76 percent, respectively) but was not measurably different from the percentage of combined schools reporting the presence of security staff. A higher percentage of public high schools (62 percent) than of primary (16 percent), combined (24 percent), or middle schools (46 percent) reported having full-time security staff (table 20.3). Differences in the presence of security staff were also found by other school characteristics. For example, the percentage of public city schools that reported the presence of one or more security staff at least once a week during the 2009-10 school year (51 percent) was higher than the percentages of town schools (39 percent) and rural schools (35 percent). The percentage of public suburban schools reporting the presence of security staff (45 percent) was also higher than the percentage of rural schools. Public schools were also asked to report whether any of their security staff routinely carried a firearm at school. 44 In 2009-10, some 28 percent of all public schools reported the presence of security staff routinely carrying a firearm (table 20.3). The percentage of public schools reporting security staff routinely carrying firearms was higher in 2007-08 (34 percent) than in either 2005-06 (31 percent) or 2009-10 (28 percent); there was no measurable difference between 2005-06 and 2009-10. Twelve percent of public primary schools, 25 percent of combined schools, 51 percent of middle schools, and 63 percent of high schools reported the presence of one or more security staff at their schools routinely carrying firearms during the 2009-10 school year."}, {"section_title": "Indicator 21 Students' Reports of Safety and Security Measures Observed at School", "text": "In 2011, about 77 percent of students ages 12-18 reported observing one or more security cameras to monitor the school during the day at their schools, and 70 percent of students reported the presence of security guards and/or assigned police officers. Schools use a variety of measures to promote the safety of students, ranging from codes of student conduct to metal detectors. In the School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12-18 were asked whether their schools used certain security measures. 45 Security measures include metal detectors, locker checks, security cameras, security guards or police officers, adult supervision in hallways, badges or picture identification for students, a code of student conduct, locked entrance or exit doors during the day, and a requirement that visitors sign in. In 2011, nearly all students ages 12-18 reported that they observed the use of at least one of the selected security measures at their schools (figure 21.1 and table 21.1). In 2011, most students ages 12-18 reported that their schools had a code of student conduct (96 percent) and a requirement that visitors sign in (95 percent). Approximately 89 percent of students reported the presence of other school staff or other adult supervision in the hallway, and 77 percent of students reported the use of one or more security cameras at their schools. Seventy percent of students reported the presence of security guards and/or assigned police officers, 65 percent reported locked entrance or exit doors during the day, and 53 percent reported locker checks. In addition, 25 percent of students reported that the wearing of badges or picture identification was required at their schools. Metal detectors were the least observed of the selected safety and security measures: 11 percent of students reported the use of metal detectors at their schools. The percentage of students who reported the presence of one or more security cameras to monitor the school increased between the two most recent survey years as well as over the past 10 years. Specifically, 77 percent of students reported observing the use of one or more security cameras at their schools in 2011, which represented an increase from 70 percent in 2009 as well as an overall increase from 39 percent in 2001. Regarding the school security measure of having locked entrance or exit doors during the day, the percentage of students who reported observing this security measure increased from 38 percent in 1999 to 65 percent in 2011. Over the same period, the percentage of students who reported a requirement that visitors sign in increased (87 vs. 95 percent) as did the percentage who reported the presence of metal detectors at school (9 vs. 11 percent). The percentage of students who reported the presence of security guards and/or assigned police officers was not measurably different from 2009 to 2011. The percentage of students who reported the presence of security guards and/or police officers increased from 54 percent in 1999 to 64 percent in 2001 and to 70 percent in 2003; however, there was no significant trend in this percentage between 2003 and 2011. From 2009 to 2011, the percentage of students who reported other school staff or other adult supervision in the hallway decreased from 91 to 89 percent, although the percentage in 2011 was not measurably different from the percentage in 1999. Between the earliest survey year for which data were reported and 2011, no measurable increases or decreases were detected in the percentages of students who reported locker checks, requirements that students wear badges or picture identification, or a code of student conduct in their schools during the school year.

There was also a decrease in the number of on-campus crimes reported per 10,000 full-time-equivalent students, from 20.8 in 2010 to 19.7 in 2011. Since 1990, postsecondary institutions participating in Title IV federal student financial aid programs have been required to comply with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, known as the Clery Act. The Clery Act requires institutions to give timely warnings about crimes to students and staff; to publicly report campus crime and safety policies; and to collect, report, and disseminate campus crime data. Since 1999, data on campus safety and security have been reported by institutions through the Campus Safety and Security Survey. These reports include on-campus criminal offenses and arrests involving students, faculty, staff, and the general public. Reports on referrals for disciplinary action primarily deal with persons associated formally with the institution (i.e., students, faculty, and other staff). In 2011, there were 30,400 criminal incidents on campus at public and private 2-year and 4-year postsecondary institutions that were reported to police and security agencies, representing a 5 percent decrease from 2010 (31,900; table 22.1). Also, there was a decrease in the number of on-campus crimes per 10,000 full-time-equivalent (FTE) students, from 20.8 in 2010 to 19.7 in 2011 (table 22.2). Among the various types of on-campus crimes reported in 2011, there were 19,500 burglaries, constituting 64 percent of all criminal incidents (table  22. 6). Between 2006 and 2011, the number of reported crimes decreased, enrollment increased, and the number of on-campus crimes per 10,000 students decreased from 33.3 to 19.7. The rates per 10,000 students for all types of reported crimes on campus were lower in 2011 than in 2001, except in the case of forcible sex offenses, which was higher in 2011 (2.2 per 10,000 students) than in 2001 (1.9 per 10,000 students).  Motor vehicle theft 3 Motor vehicle theft 3 Forcible sex offense 4 In 2011, the number of crimes committed on college campuses differed by type of institution, though to some extent this reflects the enrollment size of the sectors and the presence of student residence halls. For example, more crimes were committed at institutions with residence halls than at institutions without residence halls (table  22.2). Crimes involving students on campus after normal class hours, such as in residence halls, are included in campus crime reports, while crimes involving students off campus are not. At public 4-year institutions in 2011, 49 percent of the 14,679 on-campus crimes occurred in residence halls; at nonprofit 4-year institutions 61 percent of the 10,742 on-campus crimes occurred in residence halls (table 22.1). Although data for different types of institutions are difficult to compare directly because of the differing structures of student services and campus arrangements, there were decreases in the numbers of on-campus crimes at most types of institutions between 2006 and 2011. At public 4-year institutions, the number of on-campus crimes decreased from a high of 20,600 in 2006 to 14,700 in 2011. Also, the number of on-campus crimes per 10,000 students decreased from 35.5 to 21.9 during this period (table  22.2). Similarly, at nonprofit 4-year institutions, the number of crimes decreased from 16,900 in 2006 to 10,700 in 2011, and the number of crimes per 10,000 students decreased from 57.7 to 33.0. At public 2-year institutions, which generally do not have residence halls, the number of crimes declined from 5,700 to 4,100 between 2006 and 2011, and the number of crimes per 10,000 students decreased from 15.4 to 9.7. As part of the Clery Act, institutions are required to report the number of arrests made for illegal weapons possession and drug and liquor law violations on college campuses. In contrast to the decreases in reported on-campus crimes, the total number of arrests for illegal weapons possession and drug and liquor law violations increased from 40,300 in 2001 to 54,600 in 2011 (table 22.1 and figure 22.2). While the number of arrests for weapons possession was 4 percent lower in 2011 than in 2001 (1,000 vs. 1,100), there were increases in the larger categories of drug and liquor law violations. Arrests for drug law violations increased by 75 percent during this period, reaching 20,700, and arrests for liquor law violations rose by 20 percent, reaching 32,900. Some of the increase in arrests may be associated with increases in student enrollment during this period. The number of arrests for drug law violations per 10,000 students increased from 10.2 to 13.5 (table  22.2); however, the number of arrests per 10,000 students for liquor law violations was lower in 2011 (21.3) than in 2001 (23.5). There were some differences in the patterns of oncampus arrests among institution types. At public 4-year institutions, the number of on-campus arrests per 10,000 students was higher in 2011 than in 2001 (67.1 vs. 60.1). In contrast, there was a decrease in the number of on-campus arrests per 10,000 students at nonprofit 4-year institutions, from 24.5 to 16.8. The number of on-campus arrests per 10,000 students at public 2-year institutions in 2011 was 8.9, which was higher than in 2001 (7.8) but lower than in 2006 (10.9). In addition to on-campus arrests, institutions report referrals for disciplinary actions for cases involving illegal weapons possession, drug law violations, and liquor law violations. Disciplinary action counts only include incidents for which there were referrals for institutional disciplinary actions but no arrest was made. In 2011, there were 250,600 referrals for disciplinary actions for cases involving weapons, drugs, and liquor law violations, with the largest number of these (197,200)    Similar to the number of on-campus arrests for drug and liquor law violations, the number of disciplinary referrals for these incidents has increased. The number of referrals for drug law violations rose by 118 percent, from 23,900 in 2001 to 52,000 in 2011 (figure 22.3). The number of referrals for liquor law violations rose by 52 percent, from 130,000 to 197,200. The number of disciplinary referrals for illegal weapons possession was lower in 2011 (1,300) than in 2006 (1,900), but it was about the same as in 2001 (1,300). Some of these increases may be associated with more students on college campuses; however, there were increases in the number of disciplinary actions per 10,000 students, as the number of disciplinary actions rose faster than enrollment. The number of disciplinary referrals for drug law violations increased from 20.5 per 10,000 students in 2001 to 33.8 per 10,000 students in 2011 (table 22.2). Also, the number of referrals for liquor law violations per 10,000 students was higher in 2011 (128.1) than in 2001 (111.3). In contrast, the number of referrals per 10,000 students for illegal weapons possession was lower in 2011 (0.9) than in 2001 (1.1). Both public 4-year and nonprofit 4-year institutions had increases in disciplinary referrals between 2001 and 2011. At public 4-year institutions, the number of referrals for disciplinary actions involving illegal weapons, drug law violations, and liquor law violations increased from 153.1 per 10,000 students in 2001 to 193.3 in 2011. At nonprofit 4-year institutions, the number of referrals for these types of incidents rose from 275.5 per 10,000 students to 341.2 per 10,000 students. About 80 percent of these referrals for disciplinary actions at public 4-year and nonprofit 4-year institutions were for liquor law violations.  1 A school-associated violent death is defined as \"a homicide, suicide, or legal intervention (involving a law enforcement officer), in which the fatal injury occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school in the United States,\" while the victim was on the way to or from regular sessions at school, or while the victim was attending or traveling to or from an official school-sponsored event. 2 \"At school\" includes on school property, on the way to or from regular sessions at school, and while attending or traveling to or from a school-sponsored event. 3 Total youth suicides are reported for calendar years 1992 through 2010 (instead of school years 1992-93 through 2010-11   1 Serious violent victimization is also included in all violent victimization. 2 \"At school\" includes inside the school building, on school property, or on the way to and from school. 3 Due to methodological differences, use caution when comparing 2006 estimates to other years.

Cases are initially identified through a search of the LexisNexis newspaper and media database. Then law enforcement officials are contacted to confirm the details of the case and to determine if the event meets the case definition. Once a case is confirmed, a law enforcement official and a school official are interviewed regarding details about the school, event, victim(s), and offender(s). A copy of the full law enforcement report is also sought for each case. The information obtained on schools includes school demographics, attendance/absentee rates, suspensions/expulsions and mobility, school history of weapon-carrying incidents, security measures, violence prevention activities, school response to the event, and school policies about weapon carrying. Event information includes the location of injury, the context of injury (while classes were being held, during break, etc.), motives for injury, method of injury, and school and community events happening around the time period. Information obtained on victim(s) and offender(s) includes demographics, circumstances of the event (date/time, alcohol or drug use, number of persons involved), types and origins of weapons, criminal history, psychological risk factors, school-related problems, extracurricular activities, and family history, including structure and stressors. One hundred and five school-associated violent deaths were identified from July 1, 1992, to June 30, 1994(Kachur et al. 1996. A more recent report from this data collection identified 253 school-associated violent deaths between July 1, 1994, and June 30, 1999(Anderson et al. 2001. Other publications from this study have described how the number of events change during the school year (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2001), the source of the firearms used in these events (Reza et al. 2003), and suicides that were associated with schools (Kauffman et al. 2004). The most recent publication describes trends in school-associated homicide from July 1, 1992, to June 30, 2006(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2008. The interviews conducted on cases between July 1, 1994, andJune 30, 1999, achieved a response rate of 97 percent for police officials and 78 percent for school officials. For several reasons, all data for years from 1999 to the present are flagged as preliminary. For some recent data, the interviews with school and law enforcement officials to verify case details have not been completed. The details learned during the interviews can occasionally change the classification of a case. Also, new cases may be identified because of the expansion of the scope of the media files used for case identification. Sometimes other cases not identified during earlier data years using the independent case finding efforts (which focus on nonmedia sources of information) will be discovered. Also, other cases may occasionally be identified while the law enforcement and school interviews are being conducted to verify known cases.

For states with a first stage weight greater than 2.0000-meaning that the state reported SHR data for less than half of the FBI's estimated number of murder victims in the state-the first stage weight is set to 1. a small number of victimizations, referred to as series victimizations, are included in this report using a new counting strategy. High-frequency repeat victimizations, or series victimizations, are six or more similar but separate victimizations that occur with such frequency that the victim is unable to recall each individual event or describe each event in detail. As part of ongoing research efforts associated with the redesign of the NCVS, BJS investigated ways to include high-frequency repeat victimizations, or series victimizations, in estimates of criminal victimization. Including series victimizations results in more accurate estimates of victimization. BJS has decided to include series victimizations using the victim's estimates of the number of times the victimization occurred over the past 6 months, capping the number of victimizations within each series at a maximum of 10. This strategy for counting series victimizations balances the desire to estimate national rates and account for the experiences of persons who have been subjected to repeat victimizations against the desire to minimize the estimation errors that can occur when repeat victimizations are reported. Including series victimizations in national rates results in rather large increases in the level of violent victimization; however, trends in violence are generally similar regardless of whether series victimizations are included. For more information on the new counting strategy and supporting research, see Methods for Counting High-Frequency Repeat Victimizations in the National Crime Victimization Survey at http://bjs.ojp.usdoj. gov/content/pub/pdf/mchfrv.pdf. Readers should note that in 2003, in accordance with changes to the Office of Management and Budget's standards for the classification of federal data on race and ethnicity, the NCVS item on race/ ethnicity was modified. A question on Hispanic origin is now followed by a new question about race. The new question about race allows the respondent to choose more than one race and delineates Asian as a separate category from Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. An analysis conducted by the Demographic Surveys Division at the U.S. Census Bureau showed that the new race question had very little impact on the aggregate racial distribution of NCVS respondents, with one exception: There was a 1.6 percentage point decrease in the percentage of respondents who reported themselves as White. Due to changes in race/ethnicity categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be made with caution. There were changes in the sample design and survey methodology in the 2006 National Crime Victimiza- The number of NCVS-eligible households in the sample in 2012 was about 107,000. Households were selected using a stratified, multistage cluster design. In the first stage, the primary sampling units (PSUs), consisting of counties or groups of counties, were selected. In the second stage, smaller areas, called Enumeration Districts (EDs), were selected from each sampled PSU. Finally, from selected EDs, clusters of four households, called segments, were selected for interview. At each stage, the selection was done proportionate to population size in order to create a self-weighting sample. The final sample was augmented to account for households constructed after the decennial Census. Within each sampled household, the U.S. Census Bureau interviewer attempts to interview all household members age 12 and older to determine whether they had been victimized by the measured crimes during the 6 months preceding the interview. The first NCVS interview with a housing unit is conducted in person. Subsequent interviews are conducted by telephone, if possible. About 81,000 persons age 12 and older are interviewed each 6 months. Households remain in the sample for 3 years and are interviewed seven times at 6-month intervals. Since the survey's inception, the initial interview at each sample unit has been used only to bound future interviews to establish a time frame to avoid duplication of crimes uncovered in these subsequent interviews. Beginning in 2006, data from the initial interview have been adjusted to account for the effects of bounding and have been included in the survey estimates. After a household has been interviewed its seventh time, it is replaced by a new sample household. The NCVS has consistently obtained a response rate of around 90 percent at the household level. The completion rates for persons within households in 2012 were about 87 percent. Weights were developed to permit estimates for the total U.S. population 12 years and older. For more information about the NCVS, contact: Education 2003). Due to the low unit response rate in 2005,2007,2009, and 2011, a unit nonresponse bias analysis was done. Unit response rates indicate how many sampled units have completed interviews. Because interviews with students could only be completed after households had responded to the NCVS, the unit completion rate for the SCS reflects both the household interview completion rate and the student interview completion rate. Nonresponse can greatly affect the strength and application of survey data by leading to an increase in variance as a result of a reduction in the actual size of the sample and can produce bias if the nonrespondents have characteristics of interest that are different from the respondents. In order for response bias to occur, respondents must have different response rates and responses to particular survey variables. The magnitude of unit nonresponse bias is determined by the response rate and the differences between respondents and nonrespondents on key survey variables. Although the bias analysis cannot measure response bias since the SCS is a sample survey and it is not known how the population would have responded, the SCS sampling frame has four key student or school characteristic variables for which data is known for respondents and nonrespondents: sex, race/ethnicity, household income, and urbanicity, all of which are associated with student victimization. To the extent that there are differential responses by respondents in these groups, nonresponse bias is a concern. In 2005, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of bias for the race, household income, and urbanicity variables. White (non-Hispanic) and Other (non-Hispanic) respondents had higher response rates than Black (non-Hispanic) and Hispanic respondents. Respondents from households with an income of $35,000-$49,999 and $50,000 or more had higher response rates than those from households with incomes of less than $7,500, $7,500-$14,999, $15,000-$24,999 and $25,000-$34,999. Respondents who live in urban areas had lower response rates than those who live in rural or suburban areas. Although the extent of nonresponse bias cannot be determined, weighting adjustments, which corrected for differential response rates, should have reduced the problem. In 2007, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of bias by the race/ethnicity and household income variables. Hispanic respondents had lower response rates than other race/ethnicities. Respondents from households with an income of $25,000 or more had higher response rates than those from households with incomes of less than $25,000. However, when responding students are compared to the eligible NCVS sample, there were no measurable differences between the responding students and the eligible students, suggesting the nonresponse bias has little impact on the overall estimates. In 2009, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of potential bias for the race/ethnicity and urbanicity variables. White students and students of other race/ethnicities had higher response rates than did Black and Hispanic respondents. Respondents from households located in rural areas had higher response rates than those from households located in urban areas. However, when responding students are compared to the eligible NCVS sample, there were no measurable differences between the responding students and the eligible students, suggesting the nonresponse bias has little impact on the overall estimates. In 2011, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of potential bias for the age variable. Respondents 12 to 17 years old had higher response rates than did 18 year old respondents in the NCVS and SCS interviews. Weighting the data adjusts for unequal selection probabilities and for the effects of nonresponse. The weighting adjustments that correct for differential response rates are created by region, age, race, and sex, and should have reduced the effect of nonresponse. Response rates for most SCS survey items in all survey years were high-typically over 97 percent of all eligible respondents meaning there is little potential for item nonresponse bias for most items in the survey. Weights were developed to compensate for differential probabilities of selection and nonresponse. The weighted data permit inferences about the eligible student population who were enrolled in schools in all SCS data years.

The YRBSS focuses on priority health-risk behaviors established during youth that result in the most significant mortality, morbidity, disability, and social problems during both youth and adulthood. The YRBSS includes a national school-based Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) as well as surveys conducted in states and large urban school districts. This report uses 1993uses , 1995uses , 1997uses , 1999uses , 2001uses , 2003uses , 2005uses , 2007uses , 2009uses , and 2011 The national YRBS uses a three-stage cluster sampling design to produce a nationally representative sample of students in grades 9-12 in the United States. The target population consisted of all public and private school students in grades 9-12 in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The first-stage sampling frame included selecting primary sampling units (PSUs) from strata formed on the basis of urbanization and the relative percentage of Black and Hispanic students in the PSU. These PSUs are either counties; subareas of large counties; or groups of smaller, adjacent counties. At the second stage, schools were selected with probability proportional to school enrollment size. The final stage of sampling consisted of randomly selecting, in each chosen school and in each of grades 9-12, one or two classrooms from either a required subject, such as English or social studies, or a required period, such as homeroom or second period. All students in selected classes were eligible to participate. Three strategies were used to oversample Black and Hispanic students: (1) larger sampling rates were used to select PSUs that are in high-Black and high-Hispanic strata; (2) a modified measure of size was used that increased the probability of selecting schools with a disproportionately high minority enrollment; and (3) two classes per grade, rather than one, were selected in schools with a high percentage of combined Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, or American Indian/Alaska Native enrollment. Approximately 16,300 students participated in the 1993 survey, 10,900 students participated in the 1995 survey, 16,300 students participated in the 1997 survey, 15,300 students participated in the 1999 survey, 13,600 students participated in the 2001 survey, 15,200 students participated in the 2003 survey, 13,900 students participated in the 2005 survey, 14,000 students participated in the 2007 survey, 16,400 students participated in the 2009 survey, and 15,400 participated in the 2011 survey. The overall response rate was 70 percent for the 1993 survey, 60 percent for the 1995 survey, 69 percent for the 1997 survey, 66 percent for the 1999 survey, 63 percent for the 2001 survey, 67 percent for the 2003 survey, 67 percent for the 2005 survey, 68 percent for the 2007 survey, 71 percent for the 2009 survey, and 71 percent for the 2011 survey. NCES standards call for response rates of 85 percent or better for cross-sectional surveys, and bias analyses are required by NCES when that percentage is not achieved. For YRBS data, a full nonresponse bias analysis has not been done because the data necessary to do the analysis are not available. The weights were developed to adjust for nonresponse and the oversampling of Black and Hispanic students in the sample. The final weights were constructed so that only weighted proportions of students (not weighted counts of students) in each grade matched national population projections. State-level data were downloaded from the Youth Online: Comprehensive Results web page (http:// apps.nccd.cdc.gov/youthonline/App/Default.aspx). Each state and district school-based YRBS employs a two-stage, cluster sample design to produce representative samples of students in grades 9-12 in their jurisdiction. All except a few state samples, and all district samples, include only public schools, and each district sample includes only schools in the funded school district (e.g., San Diego Unified School District) rather than in the entire city (e.g., greater San Diego area). In the first sampling stage in all except a few states and districts, schools are selected with probability proportional to school enrollment size. In the second sampling stage, intact classes of a required subject or intact classes during a required period (e.g., second period) are selected randomly. All students in sampled classes are eligible to participate. Certain states and districts modify these procedures to meet their individual needs. For example, in a given state or district, all schools, rather than a sample of schools, might be selected to participate. State and local surveys that have a scientifically selected sample, appropriate documentation, and an overall response rate greater than or equal to 60 percent are weighted. The overall response rate reflects the school response rate multiplied by the student response rate. These three criteria are used to ensure that the data from those surveys can be considered representative of students in grades 9-12 in that jurisdiction. A weight is applied to each record to adjust for student nonresponse and the distribution of students by grade, sex, and race/ethnicity in each jurisdiction. Therefore, weighted estimates are representative of all students in grades 9-12 attending schools in each jurisdiction. Surveys that do not have an overall response rate of greater than or equal to 60 percent and that do not have appropriate documentation are not weighted and are not included in this report. In 2011, a total of 43 states and 21 districts had weighted data. Not all of the districts were contained in the 43 states. For example, California was not one of the 43 states that obtained weighted data but it contained several districts that did. For more information on the location of the districts please see http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/yrbs/participation. htm. In sites with weighted data, the student sample sizes for the state and district YRBS ranged from 1,103 to 13,201. School response rates ranged from 73 to 100 percent, student response rates ranged from 60 to 88 percent, and overall response rates ranged from 60 to 86 percent. Readers should note that reports of these data published by the CDC and in this report do not include percentages where the denominator includes less than 100 unweighted cases. In 1999, in accordance with changes to the Office of Management and Budget's standards for the classification of federal data on race and ethnicity, the YRBS item on race/ethnicity was modified. The version of the race and ethnicity question used in 1993, 1995, and 1997 version used in 1999, 2001, 2003, and in the 2005, 2007, and 2009 2007,2009, and 2011 surveys, race/ethnicity was computed from two questions: (1) \"Are you Hispanic or Latino?\" (response options were \"yes\" and \"no\"), and 2\"What is your race?\" (response options were \"American Indian or Alaska Native,\" \"Asian,\" \"Black or African American,\" \"Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,\" or \"White\"). For the second question, students could select more than one response option. For this report, students were classified as \"Hispanic\" if they answered \"yes\" to the first question, regardless of how they answered the second question. Students who answered \"no\" to the first question and selected more than one race/ethnicity in the second category were classified as \"More than one race.\" Students who answered \"no\" to the first question and selected only one race/ethnicity were classified as that race/ ethnicity. Race/ethnicity was classified as missing for students who did not answer the first question and for students who answered \"no\" to the first question but did not answer the second question. CDC has conducted two studies to understand the effect of changing the race/ethnicity item on the YRBS. Brener, Kann, and McManus (2003) found that allowing students to select more than one response to a single race/ethnicity question on the YRBS had only a minimal effect on reported race/ ethnicity among high school students. Eaton, Brener, Kann, and Pittman (2007) found that self-reported race/ethnicity was similar regardless of whether the single-question or a two-question format was used.

Data reported by districts, schools, principals, and teachers provide a variety of statistics on the condition of education in the United States that may be used by policy makers and the general public. The SASS system covers a wide range of topics, including teacher demand, teacher and principal characteristics, teachers' and principals' perceptions of school climate and problems in their schools, teacher and principal compensation, district hiring and retention practices, general conditions in schools, and basic characteristics of the student population. SASS data are collected through a mail questionnaire with telephone and in-person field follow-up. SASS has been conducted by the Census Bureau for NCES since the first administration of the survey, which was conducted during the 1987-88 school year. Subsequent SASS administrations were conducted in 1990-91, 1993-94, 1999-2000, 2003-04, 2007-08, and 2011-12. SASS is designed to produce national, regional, and state estimates for public elementary and secondary schools, school districts, principals, teachers, and school library media centers; and national and regional estimates for public charter schools, as well as principals, teachers, and school library media centers within these schools. For private schools, the sample supports national, regional, and affiliation estimates for schools, principals, and teachers. From its inception, SASS has had four core components: school questionnaires, teacher questionnaires, principal questionnaires, and school district (prior to 1999-2000, \"teacher demand and shortage\") questionnaires. A fifth component, school library media center questionnaires, was introduced in the 1993-94 administration and has been included in every subsequent administration of SASS. School library data were also collected in the 1990-91 administration of the survey through the school and principal questionnaires. School questionnaires used in SASS include the Public and Private School Questionnaires; teacher questionnaires include the Public and Private School Teacher Questionnaires; principal questionnaires include the Public and Private School Principal (or School Administrator) Questionnaires, and school district questionnaires include the School District (or Teacher Demand and Shortage) Questionnaires. Although the four core questionnaires and the school library media questionnaires have remained relatively stable over the various administrations of SASS, the survey has changed to accommodate emerging issues in elementary and secondary education. Some items have been added, some have been deleted, and some questionnaire items have been reworded. During the 1990-91 SASS cycle, NCES worked with the Office of Indian Education to add an Indian School Questionnaire to SASS, and it remained a part of SASS through 2007-08. The Indian School Questionnaire explores the same school-level issues that the Public and Private School Questionnaires explore, allowing comparisons among the three types of schools. The 1990The -91, 1993The -94, 1999The -04, and 2007 administrations of SASS obtained data on Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) schools (schools funded or operated by the BIE), but the 2011-12 administration did not obtain BIE data. SASS estimates for all survey years presented in this report exclude BIE schools, and as a result, estimates in this report may differ from those in previously published reports. School library media center questionnaires were administered in public, private, and BIE schools as part of the 1993-1994and 1999 During the 2003-04 administration of SASS, only library media centers in public schools were surveyed, and in 2007-08 library media centers in public schools and BIE and BIE-funded schools. The 2011-12 survey collected data only on school library media centers in traditional public schools and in public charter schools. School library questions focused on facilities, services and policies, staffing, technology, information literacy, collections and expenditures, and media equipment. New or revised topics included access to online licensed databases, resource availability, and additional elements on information literacy. The Student Records and Library Media Specialist/ Librarian Questionnaires were administered only in 1993-94. As part of the 1999-2000 SASS, the Charter School Questionnaire was sent to the universe of charter schools in operation in 1998-99. In 2003-04 and in subsequent administrations of SASS, charter schools were included in the public school sample as opposed to being sent a separate questionnaire. Another change in the 2003-04 administration of SASS was a revised data collection procedure using a primary in-person contact within the school intended to reduce the field follow-up phase. The SASS teacher surveys collect information on the characteristics of teachers, such as their age, race/ethnicity, years of teaching experience, average number of hours per week spent on teaching activities, base salary, average class size, and highest degree earned. These teacher-reported data may be combined with related information on their school's characteristics, such as school type (e.g., public traditional, public charter, Catholic, private other religious, and private nonsectarian), community type, and school enrollment size. The teacher questionnaires also ask for information on teacher opinions regarding the school and teaching environment. In 1993-94, about 53,000 public school teachers and 10,400 private school teachers were sampled. In 1999-2000, about 56,300 public school teachers, 4,400 public charter school teachers, and 10,800 private school teachers were sampled. In 2003-04, about 52,500 public school teachers and 10,000 private school teachers were sampled. In 2007-08, about 48,400 public school teachers and 8,200 private school teachers were sampled. In 2011-12, about 51,100 public school teachers and 7,100 private school teachers were sampled. Weighted overall response rates in 2011-12 were 61.8 percent for public school teachers and 50.1 percent for private school teachers. The SASS principal surveys focus on such topics as age, race/ethnicity, sex, average annual salary, years of experience, highest degree attained, perceived influence on decisions made at the school, and hours spent per week on all school activities. These data on principals can be placed in the context of other SASS data, such as the type of the principal's school (e.g., public traditional, public charter, Catholic, other religious, or nonsectarian), enrollment, and percentage of students eligible for free or reduced price lunch. In 2003-04, about 10,200 public school principals were sampled, and in 2007-08, about 9,800 public school principals were sampled. In 2011-12, about 11,000 public school principals and 3,000 private school principals were sampled. Weighted response rates in 2011-12 for public school principals and private school principals were 72.7 percent and 64.7 percent, respectively. The SASS 2011-12 sample of schools was confined to the 50 states and the District of Columbia and excludes the other jurisdictions, the Department of Defense overseas schools, the BIE schools, and schools that do not offer teacher-provided classroom instruction in grades 1-12 or the ungraded equivalent. The SASS 2011-12 sample included 10,250 traditional public schools, 750 public charter schools, and 3,000 private schools. The public school sample for the 2011-12 SASS was based on an adjusted public school universe file from the 2009-10 Common Core of Data (CCD), a database of all the nation's public school districts and public schools. The private school sample for the 2011-12 SASS was selected from the 2009-10 Private School Universe Survey (PSS), as updated for the 2011-12 PSS. This update collected membership lists from private school associations and religious denominations, as well as private school lists from state education departments. The 2011-12 SASS private school frame was further augmented by the inclusion of additional schools that were identified through the 2009-10 PSS area frame data collection. Additional resources available regarding SASS include the methodology report Quality Profile for SASS, Rounds 1-3: 1987Rounds 1-3: -1995 \nCity A territory inside an urbanized area (defined as densely settled \"cores\" with populations of 50,000 or more of Census-defined blocks with adjacent densely settled surrounding areas) and inside a principal city (defined as a city that contains the primary population and economic center of a metropolitan statistical area, which, in turn, is defined as one or more contiguous counties that have a \"core\" area with a large population nucleus and adjacent communities that are highly integrated economically or socially with the core). Elementary school A school in which the lowest grade is less than or equal to grade 6 and the highest grade is less than or equal to grade 8. Elementary teachers See instructional level. Instructional level Teachers are divided into elementary or secondary based on a combination of the grades taught, main teaching assignment, and the structure of their classes. Those with only ungraded classes become elementary level teachers if their main assignment is Early childhood/Pre-k or Elementary, or they teach either special education in a self-contained classroom or an elementary enrichment class. All other teachers with ungraded classes are classified as secondary level. Among teachers with regularly graded classes, elementary level teachers generally teach any of grades Pre-k-5; report an Early childhood/Pre-k, Elementary, Self-contained special education, or Elementary enrichment main assignment; or the majority of grades taught are K-6. In general, secondary level teachers instruct any of grades 7-12 but usually no grade lower than 5th. They also teach more of grades 7-12 than lower level grades. Rural A territory outside any urbanized area (defined as densely settled \"cores\" with populations of 50,000 or more of Census-defined blocks with adjacent densely settled surrounding areas) or urban cluster (defined as densely settled \"cores\" with populations between 25,000 and 50,000 of Census-defined blocks with adjacent densely settled surrounding areas). Secondary school A school in which the lowest grade is greater than or equal to grade 7 and the highest grade is less than or equal to grade 12. Secondary teachers See instructional level. Suburban A territory outside a principal city (defined as a city that contains the primary population and economic center of a metropolitan statistical area, which, in turn, is defined as one or more contiguous counties that have a \"core\" area with a large population nucleus and adjacent communities that are highly integrated economically or socially with the core) and inside an urbanized area (defined as densely settled \"cores\" with populations of 50,000 or more of Census-defined blocks with adjacent densely settled surrounding areas). Town A territory inside an urban cluster (defined as densely settled \"cores\" with populations between 25,000 and 50,000 of Census-defined blocks with adjacent densely settled surrounding areas)."}, {"section_title": "School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS)", "text": "The School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS) is managed by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) on behalf of the U.S. Department of Education. SSOCS collects extensive crime and safety data from principals and school administrators of U.S. public schools. Data from this collection can be used to examine the relationship between school characteristics and violent and serious violent crimes in primary schools, middle schools, high schools, and combined schools. In addition, data from SSOCS can be used to assess what crime prevention programs, practices, and policies are used by schools. SSOCS has been conducted in school years 1999-2000, 2003-04, 2005-06, 2007-08, and 2009-10. SSOCS was developed by NCES and is funded by the Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools of the U.S. Department of Education. The 2009-10 SSOCS (SSOCS: 2010) was conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. Data collection began on February 24, 2010, when questionnaire packets were mailed to sampled schools, and continued through June 11, 2010. A total of 2,648 public schools submitted usable questionnaires: 684 primary schools, 909 middle schools, 948 high schools, and 107 combined schools. The sampling frame for SSOCS: 2010 was constructed from the 2007-08 Public Elementary/Secondary School Universe data file of the Common Core of Data (CCD), an annual collection of data on all public K-12 schools and school districts. The SSOCS sampling frame was restricted to regular public schools in the United States and the District of Columbia (including charter schools). A total of 3,476 schools were selected for the 2010 study. In February 2010, questionnaires were mailed to school principals, who were asked to complete the survey or to have it completed by the person most knowledgeable about discipline issues at the school. A total of 2,648 schools completed the survey. The weighted overall response rate was 80.8 percent. 1 A nonresponse bias analysis was conducted on the 3 items with weighted item nonresponse rates below 85 percent. The detected bias was not deemed problematic enough to suppress any items from the data file. A nonresponse bias analysis was conducted to evaluate the extent of bias for any survey stage with a base-weighted unit response rate less than 85 percent. Responding and nonresponding schools were compared across the characteristics available for both groups: school level, enrollment size, locale, percent White enrollment, region, number of FTE teachers, student-to-teacher ratio, and percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. This analysis indicated that there were no measurable differences between the responding schools and the full sample of schools, suggesting that nonresponse bias is not an issue for SSOCS: 2010. Weights were developed to adjust for the variable probabilities of selection and differential nonresponse and can be used to produce national estimates for regular public schools in the 2009-10 school year.

Rural As collected by the Common Core of Data and appended to the SSOCS data file, rural includes fringe rural areas (Census-defined rural territory that is less than or equal to 5 miles from an urbanized area,"}, {"section_title": "Campus Safety and Security Survey", "text": "Since 1990, all postsecondary institutions participating in Title IV student financial aid programs have been required to comply with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, known as the Clery Act. Originally, Congress enacted the Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act, which was amended in 1992, 1998, and again in 2000. The 1998 amendments renamed the law the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. The Clery Act requires schools to give timely warnings of crimes to the student body and staff; to publicize campus crime and safety policies; and to collect, report, and disseminate campus crime data. Crime statistics are collected and disseminated by campus security authorities. These authorities include campus police; non-police security staff responsible for monitoring campus property; municipal, county, or state law enforcement agencies with institutional agreements for security services; individuals and offices designated by the campus security policies as those to whom crimes should be reported; and officials of the institution with significant responsibility for student and campus activities. The act requires disclosure for offenses committed at geographic locations associated with each institution. For on-campus crimes, this includes property and buildings owned or controlled by the institution. In addition to on-campus crimes, the act requires disclosure of crimes committed in or on a non-campus building or property owned or controlled by the institution for educational purposes or for recognized student organizations, and on public property within or immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus. There are three types of statistics described in this report: criminal offenses; arrests for illegal weapons possession and violation of drug and liquor laws; and disciplinary referrals for illegal weapons possession and violation of drug and liquor laws. Criminal offenses include homicide, sex offenses, robbery, aggravated assaults, burglary, motor vehicle theft, and arson. Only the most serious offense is counted when more than one offense was committed during an incident. The two other categories, arrests and referrals, include counts for illegal weapons possession and violation of drug and liquor laws. Arrests and referrals relate to only those that are in violation of the law and not just in violation of institutional policies. If no federal, state, or local law was violated, these events are not reported. Further, if an individual is arrested and referred for disciplinary action for an offense, only the arrest is counted. Arrest is defined to include persons processed by arrest, citation, or summons, including those arrested and released without formal charges being placed. Referral for disciplinary action is defined to include persons referred to any official who initiates a disciplinary action of which a record is kept and which may result in the imposition of a sanction. Referrals may or may not involve the police or other law enforcement agencies. All criminal offenses and arrests may include students, faculty, staff, and the general public. These offenses may or may not involve students that are enrolled in the institution. Referrals primarily deal with persons associated formally with the institution (i.e., students, faculty, staff). Campus security and police statistics do not necessarily reflect the total amount or even the nature of crime on campus. Rather, they reflect incidents that have been reported and recorded by campus security and/ or local police. The process of reporting and recording alleged criminal incidents involve some well-known social filters and steps beginning with the victim. First, the victim or some other party must recognize that a possible crime has occurred and report the event. The event must then be recorded, and if it is recorded, the nature and type of offense must be classified. This classification may differ from the initial report due to the collection of additional evidence, interviews with witnesses, or through officer discretion. Also, the date an incident is reported may be much later than the date of the actual incident. For example, a victim may not realize something was stolen until much later or a victim of violence may wait a number of days to report a crime. Other factors are related to the probability that an incident is reported, including the severity of the event, the victim's confidence and prior experience with the police or security agency, or influence from third parties (e.g., friends and family knowledgeable about the incident). Finally the reader should be mindful that these figures represent alleged criminal offenses reported to campus security and/or local police within a given year, and they do not necessarily reflect prosecutions or convictions for crime.

Both types of error affect the estimates presented in this report. Several sources can contribute to nonsampling errors. For example, members of the population of interest are inadvertently excluded from the sampling frame; sampled members refuse to answer some of the survey questions (item nonresponse) or all of the survey questions (questionnaire nonresponse); mistakes are made during data editing, coding, or entry; the responses that respondents provide differ from the \"true\" responses; or measurement instruments such as tests or questionnaires fail to measure the characteristics they are intended to measure. Although nonsampling errors due to questionnaire and item nonresponse can be reduced somewhat by the adjustment of sample weights and imputation procedures, correcting nonsampling errors or gauging the effects of these errors is usually difficult. Sampling errors occur because observations are made on samples rather than on entire populations. Surveys of population universes are not subject to sampling errors. Estimates based on a sample will differ somewhat from those that would have been obtained by a complete census of the relevant population using the same survey instruments, instructions, and procedures. The standard error of a statistic is a measure of the variation due to sampling; it indicates the precision of the statistic obtained in a particular sample. In addition, the standard errors for two sample statistics can be used to estimate the precision of the difference between the two statistics and to help determine whether the difference based on the sample is large enough so that it represents the population difference. Most of the data used in this report were obtained from complex sampling designs rather than a simple random design. The features of complex sampling require different techniques to calculate standard errors than are used for data collected using a simple random sampling. Therefore, calculation of standard errors requires procedures that are markedly different from the ones used when the data are from a simple random sample. The Taylor series approximation technique or the balanced repeated replication (BRR) method was used to estimate most of the statistics and their standard errors in this report. Standard error calculation for data from the School Crime Supplement was based on the Taylor series approximation method using PSU and strata variables available from each dataset. For statistics based on all years of NCVS data, standard errors were derived from a formula developed by the U.S. Census Bureau, which consists of three generalized variance function (gvf) constant parameters that represent the curve fitted to the individual standard errors calculated using the Jackknife Repeated Replication technique. The coefficient of variation (C V ) represents the ratio of the standard error to the mean. As an attribute of a distribution, the C V is an important measure of the reliability and accuracy of an estimate. With the exception of Indicator 2, the C V was calculated for all estimates in this report, and in cases where the C V was between 30 and 50 percent the estimates were noted with a ! symbol (interpret data with caution). In Indicator 2, the \"!\" symbol cautions the reader that estimates marked indicate that the reported statistic was based on fewer than 10 cases. With the exception of Indicator 2, in cases where the C V was 50 percent or greater, the estimate was determined not to meet reporting standards and was suppressed."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Procedures", "text": "The comparisons in the text have been tested for statistical significance to ensure that the differences are larger than might be expected due to sampling variation. Unless otherwise noted, all statements cited in the report are statistically significant at the .05 level. Several test procedures were used, depending upon the type of data being analyzed and the nature of the statement being tested. The primary test procedure used in this report was Student's t statistic, which tests the difference between two sample estimates. The t test formula was not adjusted for multiple comparisons. The formula used to compute the t statistic is as follows: where E 1 and E 2 are the estimates to be compared and se 1 and se 2 are their corresponding standard errors. Note that this formula is valid only for independent estimates. When the estimates are not independent (for example, when comparing a total percentage with that for a subgroup included in the total), a covariance term (i.e., 2 * r * se 1 * se 2 ) must be subtracted from the denominator of the formula: \u221ase 2 + se 2 -(2 * r * se 1 * se 2 ) where r is the correlation coefficient. Once the t value was computed, it was compared to the published tables of values at certain critical levels, called alpha levels. For this report, an alpha value of .05 was used, which has a t value of 1.96. If the t value was larger than 1.96, then the difference between the two estimates is statistically significant at the 95 percent level. A linear trend test was used when differences among percentages were examined relative to ordered categories of a variable, rather than the differences between two discrete categories. This test allows one to examine whether, for example, the percentage of students using drugs increased (or decreased) over time or whether the percentage of students who reported being physically attacked in school increased (or decreased) with their age. Based on a regression with, for example, student's age as the independent variable and whether a student was physically attacked as the dependent variable, the test involves computing the regression coefficient (b and its corresponding standard error se). The ratio of these two (b/se) is the test statistic t. If t is greater than 1.96, the critical value for one comparison at the .05 alpha level, the hypothesis that there is no linear relationship between student's age and being physically attacked is rejected. Some comparisons among categories of an ordered variable with three or more levels involved a test for a linear trend across all categories, rather than a series of tests between pairs of categories. In this report, when differences among percentages were examined relative to a variable with ordered categories, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for a linear relationship between the two variables. To do this, ANOVA models included orthogonal linear contrasts corresponding to successive levels of the independent variable. The squares of the Taylorized standard errors (that is, standard errors that were calculated by the Taylor series method), the variance between the means, and the unweighted sample sizes were used to partition the total sum of squares into within-and between-group sums of squares. These were used to create mean squares for the within-and between-group variance components and their corresponding F statistics, which were then compared to published values of F for a significance level of .05. Significant values of both the overall F and the F associated with the linear contrast term were required as evidence of a linear relationship between the two variables. than the number of incidents because more than one person may be victimized during an incident. Victimization rate A measure of the occurrence of victimizations among a specific population group. For personal crimes, the number of victimizations is equal to the number of victims involved. Each victimization that is reported by the respondents is counted, so there may be one incident with two victims, which would be counted as two victimizations. The number of victimizations may be greater than the number of incidents because more than one person may be victimized during an incident.
