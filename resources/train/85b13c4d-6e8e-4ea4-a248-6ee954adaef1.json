In the health sciences, psychology, and the social sciences, use of one's own funds was the most frequently cited support mode; in mathematics, it was teaching assistantships (TAs). Fellowships,4 traineeships,5 and loans were less frequently cited modes of support in S&E as a whole. Among 1995 S&E Ph.D. recipients, women were more likely than men to report using fellowships, traineeships, their own funds, or loans as a mode of support. Men were more likely than women to have received support in the form of RAs. However, some of these aggregate differences between women's and men's support modes are related to differences in field of doctorate. As in differences in support modes cited by men and women, some of the aggregate variations across racial/ ethnic groups also reflect field differences. However, field differences do not explain all of the racial/ethnic variations in modes of support. Asians reported using RAs with greater frequency than other groups in every field except computer and information sciences and psychology.6 'See the definitions of Research I and all other Carnegie-classified institutions in appendix A. 4Fellowships are here described as nationally competitive awards granted directly by the sponsoring organization to a student. 5Traineeships are here considered to be those awards that are not nationally competitive and that are awarded by individual academic departments or institutions rather than by a sponsoring organization.

Three-quarters of the U.S. citizen and permanent resident Asians receiving S&E Ph.D.s in 1995 were permanent residents and 77 percent of those permanent residents were from the People's Republic of China. Thus, a large proportion of the U.S. citizen and permanent resident Asians receiving S&E Ph.D.s in 1995 were Chinese who may have entered graduate school as temporary residents and were therefore ineligible for modes of support that required U.S. citizenship or permanent residency. In every field, a larger percentage of both underrepresented minorities and whites reported using their own funds and loans than did either Asians or foreign students. Also in every field, higher percentages of underrepresented minorities than of other groups reported using traineeships.

One is a growing concern that graduate science and engineering ' (S&E) education in the United States is too narrowly focused to be able to meet the needs of the student or the workplace. The second is the increasing call for greater accountability by Federal agencies as exemplified in the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA). These developments have increased the attention paid to the outcomes of graduate student support and the mechanisms through which it is administered. This report focuses on the latter issuethe modes of financial support. Many analyses relating to graduate financial support have focused solely on students' primary support (COSEPUP 1995, NSF 1996b, NSB 1998, NSF 1998a. But in fact, most graduate students tend to use multiple modes of support over the course of their doctoral studies, making it difficult to rely only on a clear primary or secondary support mode for information on their financial support. Therefore, those examining the efficacy of various support modes should be aware of and take into account the multiple modes of support. They should also be aware of the extent to which such support modes vary by characteristics such as field, sex, race/ethnicity, and citizenship status of S&E doctorate recipients and the type of institution from which they received their doctorates. The purpose of this report is to examine the entire range of support patterns of S&E doctorates, showing the distribution of various modes of support to individuals. The analysis partitions data by a number of individual and institutional characteristics. The objective of the study is to provide contextual and background information about the nature of graduate financial support to those thinking either about the impacts of support modes on graduate S&E education or how to evaluate the impacts of specific graduate support programs for GPRA purposes.

Among the most frequently made recommendations are the following: broader and less specialized training; shorter time-to-degree; increased experience in nonacademic settings; improved communication skills; greater ability to work in teams; heightened awareness of possible career choices, particularly of the options available outside academia; and greater focus on attraction and retention in higher education of underrepresented minorities. In these discussions, graduate support modesthat is, the various ways in which graduate students are supported financiallyare often viewed as helping or hindering the achieVement of many of these recommendations. A report by the National Academy of Sciences' Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy (1995), Reshaping the Graduate Education of Scientists and Engineers, focused on Ph.D.s and discussed the changing context of graduate education, employment trends and prospects for graduate scientists and engineers, the impacts of sizeable populations of foreign students, time to employment, and information needs. The report indicated that research assistantships had become the dominant mode of Federal support for graduate students, but cited several drawbacks to this dependence on research grants. A major recommendation was that government agencies should adjust their support and include new education/training grants to institutions and departments. The National Science Board Task Force on Graduate Education, established in 1995, examined the merits and mix of the several modes of funding support (i.e., research assistantships, fellowships, traineeships) used by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and their impacts on graduate students' experience and preparation. The task force determined that data were insufficient to support recommendations for major revisions in the mix of NSF funding. The report concluded that: limited studies should be conducted on alternative modes of graduate support, with defined goals and assessment criteria; and data collection and/or research on funding mechanisms and their influence on various aspects of graduate student education and employment should be supported."}, {"section_title": "THE GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE AND", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "RESULTS ACT", "text": "Congress passed the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993.

These documents are intended to give agencies formal tools with which to set forth goals, prepare plans to meet those goals, and to assess and measure progress and accomplishments. As part of GPRA, every Federal agency is expected to provide information about the outputs and outcomes of its activities. Graduate education is one such activity for NSF: a key investment strategy in its broader outcome goal for a diverse, globally-oriented workforce of scientists and engineers.

SED collects data directly from doctorate recipients at 2 the time of Ph.D. conferral regarding primary, secondary, and all other modes of support used over the course of graduate study. Thus, only SED data are used in this report. Almost the entire report is based on the 1995 responses of 27,865 recipients of a science or engineering doctorate. However, the beginning of chapter 2 contains some references to 1986 SED data for comparison purposes. The SED is a universe survey of all recipients of research doctorates in the United States. The data are representative only of doctorate recipients, not of all graduate students. The SED is the only national source of data on modes of support, which is asked of every individual receiving a research doctorate in the United States. The response rate to the survey is high-94.3 percent in 1995. The response rate for mode of support was 94 percent, but only 76 percent report a primary source of support and 63 percent a secondary source.9 Because this is not a sample survey, results are not subject to sampling error, thus statistical significance is not an issue. Results are subject, however, to nonsampling error, for example, underreporting of primary and secondary mode of support. Profiles of nonrespondents are available in appendix tables A2 and A3. A further point to note is that neither of the two surveys collects information on dollar amounts of support. Thus, the report focuses on the number or percentage of new Ph.D.s reporting use of a particular mode or combination of modes of support.

In the 1995 SED survey, new Ph.D.s were asked to select, from among 32 separate support choices, those that they may have used during graduate school. In this study, those 32 possible options have been combined into 7 distinct modes of support;\" these are listed below and described in the text box: fellowships,' 4 traineeships, research assistantships (RAs), teaching assistantships (TAs), own funds, loans, and other. Respondents to the 1995 SED used all of the 127 possible combinations of these seven modes of support; respondents to the 1986 SED used 125. As would be expected, not all combinations are evenly distributed among the respondents. For example, in 1995 only one person used a combination of fellowship, traineeship, RA, loan, and other; 2,703 used a combination of RA and TA. (The combinations of support patterns are discussed in greater detail in chapter 3.) In 1995, 58 percent of all respondents reported a total of either one or two modes of support, compared to only 49 percent in 1986 (table 1). Table 2 shows the incidence of funding modes for 1986 and 1995. Use of traineeships declined from 30 to 21 percent, use of own funds from 70 to 61 percent, and use of loans from 29 to 20 percent. The use of RAs, on the other hand, increased from 56 percent in 1986 to 66 percent in 1995. Changing demographics contribute to some of this shift in use of RAs. In 1986, 21 percent .of S&E Ph.D. recipients were foreign students on temporary visas. By 1995, this amount rose to 26 percent. (NSF 1996c.)

Support patterns in S&E for Asians\u00b0 and foreign students on temporary visas are similar and patterns for whites and underrepresented minorities are similar. Asians and foreign students on temporary visas are similar because a large proportion of the Asian group,. especially Chinese students, are permanent residents who may have entered graduate school on temporary visas."}, {"section_title": "Any Support", "text": "Higher percentages of Asians and foreign students reported use of RAs as one of their modes of support than other groups of Ph.D. recipients. Nearly 8 of 10 Ph.D. recipients of Asian background reported having some RA support (table 12). Similarly, 71 percent of foreign students received RAs. Asians and foreign students were less likely than other students to report use of own funds, loans, fellowships, and traineeships. Foreign students differed 'from Asians in that a higher percentage of foreign students than of Asians reported use of own funds and \"other\" support (which includes support from foreign governments) and foreign students were the least likely of any group to use loans.20 The support mode identified as one of the modes of support by the largest percentage of both underrepresented minorities and whites was their own funds, 67 and 72 percent, respectively. Although RAs were the second largest support mode reported by both of these two groups, substantially smaller proportions of whites or underrepresented minorities reported having RAs than did either Asians or foreign students. Whites and underrepresented minorities were also much more likely to report the use of loans than. were Asians or foreign \"See \"Asian S&E Ph.D. RecipientsU.S. Citizens Compared to PermanentResidents\" on page 23 for a cautionary note on how one should interpret the comparisons across race/ethnicity and citizenship classifications. 20Most foreign students on temporary, visas are not eligible for many Federal loan programs. students. Underrepresented minorities were most likely of any racial/ethnic group to report the use of both fellowships and traineeships. The overall patterns of support for the various racial/ ethnic groups are also generally reflected in individual S&E fields. In all S&E fields, use of some loan funds is far more prevalent among both whites and underrepresented minorities than among Asians or foreign students. Also, in all S&E fields use of loans is more prevalent among underrepresented minorities than it is among whites (although some differences are small).2' The use of loans was least likely to be reported by foreign students in every field except the agricultural and earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences. In every field except the agricultural sciences, biological sciences, and mathematics, underrepresented minorities reported less use of RAs than the other three groups. In contrast, a higher percentage of underrepresented minorities reported using fellowships and traineeships than any other group in almost every major field of study. (The exception was fellowships in the earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences, where whites reported the greatest use.) Asians reported the greatest use of RAs in every field except for the computer and information sciences and psychology; in these fields, foreign students had higher RA usage than Asians."}, {"section_title": "Primary Support22", "text": "Use of various primary support modes follows the same patterns noted above for any use of the various support modes. Over half of Asian S&E doctorate recipients, and nearly half of foreign students, reported RAs as their primary mode of support; this compares with fewer than one-third of whites and about one-fifth of underrepresented minorities. In contrast, whites and underrepresented minorities were more than twice as likely to report that own funds were their primary mode of support as were Asians or foreign students. Table 12 details the primary mode of support reported by these race/ethnicity and citizenship groups. RAs are the most frequently cited primary mode for each group except for underrepresented minorities: they most frequently cited use of their own funds.  The analysis of 1995 data on Asian U.S. citizen and permanent resident S&E Ph.D.s is complicated by the Chinese Student Protection Act of 1992. The Act allowed Chinese students to apply for permanent residency in 1993. As a result the number of Asian U.S. citizen plus permanent resident S&E Ph.D.s in 1995 is higher than it would have been had this Act not been passed. In fact, only 24 percent of the 1995 doctoral recipients in this combined group were U.S. citizens while the remaining 76 percent were permanent residents.' Seventy-seven percent of those permanent residents were from the People's Republic of China. of the white U.S. citizens plus permanent resident group, while the latter group has patterns more like the foreigners on temporary visas. Therefore, these distinctions should be kept in mind when interpreting the results of this study. 23In 1992, 49 percent of this combined group were U.S. citizens."}, {"section_title": "23", "text": "Some of these variations in modes of support reflect field differences among groups. For example, appendix table A4 shows that most Asian students received their Ph.D.s in engineering (27 percent), the biological sciences (25 percent), or the physical sciences (20 percent). Each of these three fields showed a large percentage of students citing RAs as a primary or secondary mode of support. By comparison, 24 percent of Ph.D.s granted to underrepresented minorities were in psychology and 20 percent in the social sciences. Those two fields were among those with the smallest percentages of students reporting that RAs were either their primary or secondary mode of support. Despite differences in racial/ethnic distributions across fields, groups vary in mode of support within major fields of study (table 12). In every major field of study, a larger percentage of both underrepresented minorities and whites report using their own funds and loans as one of their modes of support than do Asians or foreign students. Similarly in all major fields of study, with the exception of the computer and information sciences, a larger percentage of underrepresented minorities and whites than of Asians and foreign students reported that their own funds and loans were their primary source of support. The differences in the percentage reporting any support from own funds andespeciallyloans between the underrepresented minority and white groups on the one hand, and the Asian and foreign student groups on the other, are generally much larger than the differences in the percentages reporting own funds and loans as their primary mode of support."}, {"section_title": "31", "text": "For white Ph.D. recipients (figure 6), as for underrepresented minorities, RA + own funds was the most frequently used combination. Also, like underrepresented minorities, whites relied heavily on own funds in the top five combinations of modes of support.

As table 14 shows, there is more similarity than difference in how students in the two types of institutions fund their graduate education. In both types of institutions, RAs are the most frequently used support mode, with students' own funds the next most frequent, followed by TAs. In both types of institutions, over half of the new Ph.D.s reported RAs and use of their own funds among their support modes. In public institutions, half also reported TAs as a mode of support. Graduate fellowships (nationally-competitive) were infrequently reported in either type of institution, but were cited less in public than in private ones. The top four combinations are the same for both types of institutions, with only the order and level varying (figures 8 and 9). The fifth most prevalent combination in public institutions was TA + own funds; the fifth most prevalent combination in private institutions was own funds. The top five combinations in private institutions were used by 33 percent of the doctoral recipients compared with 43 percent in public institutions.

Table 15 shows that 1995 S&E Ph.D.s from Research I institutions were less likely to report their own funds and more likely to report RAs than doctorates from other types of institutions. Fifty-eight percent of those in Research I institutions and 68 percent of those from other institutions used their own funds. Seventy percent of S&E Ph.D recipients from Research I institutions received support via an RA, while slightly more than half of those from other institutions received support in the form of an RA. These patterns hold for almost all S&E fields. Those in Research I institutions were also somewhat more likely/ to have held fellowships or traineeships or to have served as teaching assistants. For doctorates from non-Research I institutions, RA + own funds was the most frequently cited mode of support, whereas the RA + TA combination was the most frequently cited one at Research I institutions (figures 10 and 11). An examination of the combinations of support used by students in the Research I institutions versus all others shows some similarities and some differences. Four of the top five combinations of modes of support RA + TA, RA + own funds, RA + TA + own funds, and TA + own fundsare identical for both types of institutions. Own funding is important at both types of institutions but less so at Research I institutions, where it is an element of three of the five top combinations of support modes, compared with four of the top five at the other institutions.
