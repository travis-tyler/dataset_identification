Half of the seniors performing required community service reported that the requirement was connected to a class. The percentage of seniors reporting service that was entirely voluntary was nearly twice as high (297.) as the proportion reporting at least some required service. Females were more likely to perform community service than males, and whites and Asians were more likely to perform community service than were members of other racial/ethnic groups. Students' likelihood of performing community service also increased with their family socioeconomic status, reading proficiency, participation in college preparatory programs, and attendance at Catholic or other private schools. Church-related groups were the most frequently mentioned type of organization through which students performed their community service. Nearly half the seniors performing community service reported service involving one type of organization, and approximately one-fifth reported involvement with three or more types of organizations.

The C.) series primarily provides responses grounded in statistical findings, but also, as appropriate, provides some information based on smaller scale 111 research and case studies.\n\nHaving students perform unpaid community service is seen as beneficial for both society and the individual. Currently there is\nconsiderable interest in increasing student involvement in community service. At the postsecondary level, the interest is in national service linked to the forgiveness of' obligations for student fmancial aid. At the secondary level, states and school districts are considering or have adopted ways to increase opportunities for community service through elective courses and extracurricular activities as well as instituting community service graduation requirements.\nHowever, in the past there has been little information available about the extent and nature of community service performed by students. The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) provides some insights into this issue for secondary studenfs: In the spring of 1992, NELS:88 asked high school seniors about any community service they had performed in the past two years, and found that:\n44 percent of seniors reported performing such service;\nFemales, whites, Asians, seniors from higher socioeconomic status families, seniors with higher reading proficiency, seniors in private schools, and seniors in urban schools were more likely to perform service than other seniors; and\nAbout half the seniors perforrring service were involved with church-related organizations. Between 20 and 25 percent were involved in service with Youth, community, and education groups.\nHow many seniors perform community service?\nLess than half (44 percent) of high school seniors in 1992 had\nperformed any unpaid community service in the past two years (table 1). About 15 percent of all seniors performed some required service during that period. (These seniors may also have performed nonrequired service.) Half (50 percent) of the seniors performing required community service reported the requirement was in connection with a class (others reported court-ordered service or service related to some other type of requirement).\nThe proportion reporting service that was entirely voluntary was nearly twice as high (29 percent) as the proportion reporting at least some required service (table 1). About one-third (34 percent) of the seniors who did not perform any required service indicated they had done some service that was not required (last column in table 1).\nWho performs community service?\n(%\nThe likelihood of performing community service is associated with a\n0 number of student characteristics (table 1).

The likelihood of seniors reporting community service increased with family socioeconomic status (SES). Seniors with higher reading proficiency and those in college preparatory programs were also more likely to perform community service. The differences among SES quartiles and reading levels were very substantial.\nSeniors in Catholic and other private schools were more likely to perform community service than public school seniors. Higher proportions of seniors in urban ...chools reported doing service in the past two years than those in suburban or rural schools. Seniors from different regions of the country did not differ in the likelihood of performing community service.\n\nWhether any of their service was required was generally unrelated to the types of organizations with which seniors were involved in their service with three exceptions. While church-related groups were the most frequently reported type of organization for seniors both with and without any required service, those with some required service were less likely to mention church-related groups than those without any required service. On the other hand, seniors who reported that at least some of their service was required were more likely to report their service involved education groups and hospitals/nursing homes than\nthose without any required service.\nNELS:88 did not ask about the frequency of the service or how many different types of community service were performed. However, the number of types of organizations with which seniors were involved in community service is suggestive of their level of service activity.\n\nIn general, the patternr found among subgroups relative to performing any service applied to die likelihood of performing required and nonrequired service, but there were some exceptions (table I ). Seniors in Catholic schools were twice as likely to perform some required service as their peers in other private schools, who in turn were more likely to do so than seniors in public schools. While a lower share of seniors in\nCatholic schools performed non-required service only, this was\nbecause so many of them performed some required service. Among those who had not performed any required service (last column in table 1), seniors in Catholic schools were as likely to perform non-required\nservice as seniors in other types of schools. Seniors in urban schools were more likely to peiforrn some required service than seniors in suburban and rural schools, but did not differ in their likelihood of\nperforming non-required service only.\n\nAlmOst half the seniors performing some service reported service involving one type of organization; about one-fifth reported three or more types of organizations (figure 1). Seniors with some required service were slightly more likely to report three or more types of organizations (23 percent compared to 17 percent) and less likely to report service involving one type of organization 1,43 compared to 49 percent).\nFigure 1.

Almost half of the seniors who had done any community service reported their service involved church groups. Between onefifth and one-fourth of the seniors performing community service reported being involved with youth, community, and education groups.\nTable 2.

We also do not know how much service younger students are performing.\nExtensive information about the community scrvice activities of students will be gathered by NCES in 1996 through the National\nHousehold Education Survey.
