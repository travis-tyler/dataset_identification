This report summarizes a series of tasks undertaken to assess to the feasibility of a longitudinal analysis of elementary and secondary schools. The initial objective of this Education Statistics Services Institute (ESSI) project was to see if it was technically possible to analyze the overlap samples of schools from the Schools and Staffing Surveys (SASS) to produce substantive findings. The overlap sample was initially used as a variance reduction device and was never examined substantively. Over the course of the project various other objectives were added and correspondingly a number of products have resulted. These additional products include an appraisal of longitudinal designs for a general study of schools; recommendations about the use of SASS for collecting information on the implementation and impact of recent school reform proposals; and recommendations about adapting SASS through various longitudinal designs. The body of this report provides two things. The first is a discussion and set of recommendations about the use of longitudinal designs for National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) data collections and reporting on schools. The second is a description of the initial feasibility study of the use of the SASS overlap study. The appendix includes other deliverables produced over the course of the project."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The Schools and Staffing Surveys (SASS) are a series of surveys that were administered to school district staff (\"District Questionnaire\"), school administrators (\"School Administrator Questionnaire\") school administrative staff (\"School Questionnaire\"), and teachers (\"Teacher Questionnaire\") during the 1987-88, 1990-91, and 1993-94 school years. These surveys will be administered again during the 1999-2000 school year. In each of the previous SASS administrations, approximately 9,500 public schools were surveyedapproximately 11 percent of the nation's public schools. Schools were sampled for participation through stratified random sampling with probabilities proportional to size'. The degree of overlap for the public school sample was controlled and set at 30 percent (for the 1990-91 and the 1993-94 school and administrator Questionnaires). This was done to decrease the likelihood of schools or districts not wanting to participate in subsequent waves and to reduce sampling error. The overlap sample for 1990-91 and 1993-94 public schools included about 2,900 schools. The sampled schools were used to select school districts. That is, if a school were sampled, the district in which it was located was selected to receive the district (Teacher Demand and Supply) Questionnaire. By controlling the degree of overlap at 30 percent, the degree of overlap of districts was estimated to be controlled at 58 percent. Even though many of the same schools and districts were surveyed in two or more waves of the SASS, the SASS was not designed with the purpose of longitudinal analyses in mind. The feasibility of using SASS Surveys, particularly the public schoollevel data reported in the Public School and Public School Administrator Questionnaires, was assessed in this project. SASS has used a newly drawn sample of districts and schools for each of its three data collections waves (1987-88, 1990-91, and 1993-94). Although successive surveys have added new items, many of the same factors were asked about in each wave. Therefore, unlike a one-time survey, SASS is a repeated, cross-sectional survey that can provide national and state estimates of variables at different points in time. However, SASS is limited in the information it can provide on the dynamics of educational change at the school and district levels. This information is only available for a subset of schools in a special sample because different schools are surveyed in the full SASS public school sample. This working paper has two parts. The first part looks at the costs and benefits of a panel study of schools for the overall NCES statistical portfolio. The second part is a demonstration of analyses of an existing partial panel of public schools that are followed in the course of the SASS administrations. Taken together these two parts outline the feasibility of a panel design for data collection of elementary, middle, and secondary schools. In the appendix are several other products from this project, including a summary memo report on the costs and benefits of the use of a longitudinal design to obtain information on schools and educational reform in the next SASS survey. Within each of the sampling strata, the probability of selection was proportional to the square root of the number of teachers reported on the Common Core of Data School Survey data file.

A cross-sectional study refers to the collection of data from different responding units at two or more points in time. Both types of study can allow statements to be made about how responding units have changed over time. There are benefits and costs associated with each of these types of study. In order to inform decisions about NCES' undertaking a longitudinal study of schools, three specific questions are discussed: What benefits would a panel study of schools add to the statistical portfolio of NCES? What is the probability that these benefits will be fully realized within NCES reports? What are the costs relative to the benefits of such a study? A."}, {"section_title": "What Benefits Would a Panel Study of Schools Add to the Statistical Portfolio of NCES?", "text": "Theoretical Benefits versus Practical Use On a purely theoretical level, it is hard to argue against the use of longitudinal designs to collect and report information on schools in the nation. Much of the public discussion about schools and their missions concerns change, either in terms of discussions about what to change and what to leave the same, or about what people suspect has changed about the operation of schools. The public assumes that educational change is a primary component of the education system. If the public image of education is surrounded in the language of change, shouldn't the way one collects and report statistics about education directly incorporate change into study designs? This has been the logic of the existing longitudinal studies mounted by NCES. The panel surveys of students, such as High School and Beyond (HS&B) and the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS:88), are designed around the notion that following a student's educational trajectory over the school career is an approach that informs a variety of educational issues. Similarly, the various social sciences that ground our understanding of educational processes are often characterized as ventures in the study of changesuch as individual change in learning, as change in job performance of a teacher, or as a change in the organizational environment of a school. The notion that the investigation of these behavioral and social phenomena requires longitudinal data is a common assumption. It is argued that these phenomena are dynamicnamely, that they involve change over time in quantities, events, duration, or transitions to new statusand therefore, only data collection over time will inform us of their true nature (e.g., Fienberg 1989). In the past several decades, considerable improvements in the survey techniques and statistical analysis procedures involving the use of longitudinal data (e.g., Kasprzyk, Ducan, Kalton, and Singh 1989) have been made. Starting in the mid-1980s various foreign governments increased their use of panel surveys to gather information about a range of social issues. In the United States, organizations such as the "}, {"section_title": "11.", "text": "Social Science Research Council and the American Statistical Association began to both develop and promote the use of panel designs for all types of surveys. This has lead to substantial capability in engineering such surveys and in analyzing the resulting data (Duncan and Ka lton 1987). Given all of this, is it not simple to the answer the lead question in the affirmative? Indeed, others have made the same points, arguing for an NCES longitudinal study of teachers' careers . In the abstract, longitudinal designs for understanding schools are hard to reject. However, upon further reflection, the issue is far more complex, and cannot just be answered from purely a theoretical perspective. The answer is more a matter of practical use than technical capability. As a statistical agency with fixed resources, NCES needs to select wisely which innovations it should pursue and which it should leave to the research community. When the practicality of the panel data on schools is examined in relation to the kinds of information that NCES routinely publishes, it is not clear that longitudinal designs are the best way for NCES to collect information about classroom, schools, or districts. Figure 1 shows the kinds of information that can be derived from different survey designs. This table is taken from Bailar's (1989) general discussion of longitudinal designs and can easily be extended to specific educational surveys. The columns represent designs that increase by their degree of longitudinal sophistication. At the far left is the non-longitudinal single-time survey. An example of this type of survey from NCES is the typical Fast Response Survey System (FRSS) effort. Next, in terms of longitudinal sophistication is a repeated, no-overlap survey, often called a periodic survey. This is a recurring cross-sectional survey on the same topic. It asks similar or identical questions but does not administer different waves of the survey to the same respondents. Except for the technical, partial overlap sample, the SASS is an example of this design. A repeated, partial-overlap survey is a recurring survey on the same topic that rotates units. That is, a unit may be included in the first administration and then in a subsequent wave, but not necessarily included in all administrations. This design is usually employed to reduce variance in the estimates. Within the full SASS, the partial overlap sample is a good example of this design. A longitudinal, no-rotation survey (referred to hereafter as a panel study) is the most basic panel or longitudinal design. A panel of units is measured at each wave of the survey to create a full longitudinal record of information. NELS:88 is a prime example of this kind of design. Longitudinal rotation surveys are panels that add units at specified time based on substantive issues in what may be happening with the population over time. In other words, adding new units is not just a technical \"freshening\" of the sample, but is done to capture rare events in the population or compare cumulated effects of new versus old members within the population.  Bailar (1989), p. 3. The rows in this figure display the different types of information that are obtainable from each design. For example, the single-time design can yield one point in time estimates, estimates of durations, transitions, and the frequency of occurrence of events, and also inform about the relationships among characteristics. In terms of information about education, these could be estimates of the percentage of schools using site-based management (point in time), the length of time this approach has been in place assuming such a retrospective item is asked (duration), and an estimate of whether schools of certain sizes are more likely to use this management approach (relationships among characteristics). The repeated, no-overlap design yields these three kinds of information plus net change, trends, and rare events. An example of net change is the net change from the first to the second survey administration in the national mean percent of schools using site-based management. With at least three administrations, a trend (e.g., means at each time point) in this percentage could be described. Furthermore, one could show that perhaps because of training that took place between the first and second administration of the survey, new school principals who had never heard of site-based management were almost non-existent in comparison with their prevalence during earlier administrations of the survey. Design for Schools and Staffing Survey   13   a   I   I   I   I A repeated, partial-overlap design yields all of these types of information, plus gross change (also called flow or churning). Since a partial overlap provides a partial panel, gross change can be derived to some degree. An example of this would be the percentage (not just two mean percentages) of schools that changed from non-site-based management at the time of the first wave to site-based at the time of the second wave."}, {"section_title": "A Feasibility Study of Longitudinal", "text": "The two full longitudinal (panel) designs yield all of these types of information, with the exception that the longitudinal design with no rotation does not allow for certain kinds of rare events to be included. For example, if some unique event occurred between the first and second wave of the survey which resulted in the formation of a small number of a new type of school, and if these new schools adopted a distinctly different approach to site-based management, estimates of the impact of that event would be missing from a non-rotating panel design. Otherwise, both these designs yield information to estimate change over longer periods (assuming the panel is extended into time) and to estimate relationships between characteristics and change. As an example, the relationship between school size and the likelihood that a school changes to site-base management can be determined. Even the very complex information on what kind of change in size is related to what kind of change in management approach could be estimated. In sum, figure 1 shows that an impressive amount of time-related information can be derived from simpler designs. Even though the more longitudinally sophisticated designs add some unique information on change, the simpler, non-longitudinal designs still enable the description of time related phenomena."}, {"section_title": "B.", "text": "What is the Probability that these Benefits Will Be Fully Realized within NCES Reports? NCES rarely reports complex longitudinal information, even when the capability exists. Most NCES reports primarily include the first three types of estimates described above (one point, retrospective occurrences, and relationships). The fourth type of estimate (net change) is sometimes reported; the fifth type (trends), rarely reported. Even the panel surveys that NCES currently conducts rarely, if ever, generate the most sophisticated longitudinal analyses possible. In part, this is because more complicated longitudinal analyses do not easily fit within the usual NCES report. In addition, given that policymakers typically use only the most basic information, the full capabilities of a panel design currently are not (and probably would continue to not be) used. Even though policy questions are often set in terms of change over time, the real questions underneath them are simple time questions. For example, the question, \"Are more schools now using site-based management?,\" is implicitly about change, but it does not require a very sophisticated design to provide at least a basic answer. The additional value of more sophisticated measures of change is not obvious to either the lay public or to most policymakers. Therefore, on a practical level, NCES does not often use the kinds of unique information that panel designs yield. The agency's time-related information needs can be met with an array of useful information from simpler designs, and even when it has the capability for more sophisticated analyses, it rarely decides to carry these out. As is shown in the description of designs above, simpler surveys can yield a wealth of results that have some element of a time component. From a practical perspective, a fully longitudinal panel of schools would probably be used in the same way as the current, simpler designs. The prestige in the statistical world associated with the use of panel designs may outweigh their actual contribution to the agency's statistical portfolio. Nonetheless, one could argue that the case of school reform presents clear policy questions that NCES could approach with more sophisticated panel survey designs. For example, if a school adopts particular reform strategies (one kind of change), is that related to positive outcomes in students (another kind of change)? Of course, the best research design to answer this question is experimental, or at least quasiexperimental. National surveys are not the best methods for examining this kind of a question. However, since policymakers often wonder what will happen as reforms are adopted on a national scale, a survey with some longitudinal component might be considered. Therefore, it is useful to think about the main question of a panel study of schools regarding the specific issue of reform and NCES' capability to provide information on this topic, which is discussed in more detail below."}, {"section_title": "School Reform and Longitudinal Designs", "text": "Regardless of whether one or many reforms are of interest, basic questions about reform that longitudinal information about districts or schools could help to answer include: Where, how, and when are these reforms being implemented? 'How are these patterns of implementation changing over time? ',What school outcomes, if any, are attributable to reforms? In the case of the first question, longitudinal information could provide more and better information than is obtainable through a cross-sectional survey. As previously described, simpler longitudinal designs would provide a significant amount of information relative to the first two questions. For example, the repeated cross-sectional SASS could provide information on the numbers of schools that use site-based management procedures at each administration of the survey, provided the items are included each time. A panel design would enhance that useful information with more detailed information on which schools changed to more (or less) site-based management over a specific time period. The third question requires a panel design for a valid answer, provided that other more controlled experiments are not undertaken. Without pre-reform measures of school outcomes like achievement, teacher satisfaction, drop-out rates, and so forth, attributing effects to reformed practices becomes questionable. Without a doubt, the use of a longitudinal design to study reform seems attractive on the surface. Even following a panel across just two time points has clear appeal and utility for assessing the impact of new practices. Reforms are really changes in operating policy and practice, and thus they can be thought of as quasi-experimental treatments whose impact can be assessed by comparing a school's functioning before and after implementation. Of course, there are also more elaborate panel designs with rotation available to compare reformed schools with unreformed schools over the same time periods. In addition to assessing the impact of reform efforts, panel designs may be used to gather information on factors associated with the adoption of reforms and how reforms are implemented across districts and schools. The political environments of districts and schools are complex and the impetus for reform comes from a variety of sources with little, if any, centralized policy-setting in the nation. Therefore, although the national reform message may be more or less clear, reform is locally adopted and implemented. Some districts and schools will adopt reform while others will not, and the timing of adoption will vary as well. Also, among those that choose to adopt reform, actual implementation can take on different forms. Thus, although national education politics often produce pressure for educational change, the results of this pressure, falling upon a localized system, can yield substantial variation in reformed practice from location to location over time. Examining implementation over time across a panel of districts or schools is an attractive way to gather useful information on how reforms spread across the nation. It is true that multiple-waved panel designs provide more and richer information than simple crosssectional designs. But it is not clear that NCES would be willing to use these kinds of designs to their fullest capacity. There is already some information on school change available in SASS that has not been used. In addition, the use of a panel study for evaluating school reform and other topics can be quite costly."}, {"section_title": "C.", "text": "What are the Costs Relative to the Benefits of Such a Study? The widespread belief that panel studies are more expensive than cross-sectional studies is not well established. Even though certain large longitudinal studies (such as High School and Beyond and NLS72) were undeniably expensive, their costs were largely a result of the number and special characteristics of the individuals studied. Such longitudinal studies can also be expensive because of costs associated with tracking respondents. However, for the SASS School Administrator and School Questionnaires, respondent tracking costs would be negligible. Additionally, costs associated with selecting new samples and with eliciting the initial cooperation of respondents that characterize crosssectional surveys are negligible for panel studies (Pearson, 1991)."}, {"section_title": "Operations Costs versus Design Costs", "text": "The cost of conducting a panel study of schools will be discussed in the context of studying educational reform for illustrative purposes. Additionally, we will assume that SASS would be the basic host survey for such a panel design. Even though this discussion of costs is specific to SASS and reform, it applies to any other educational topic that could be addressed using a panel design. Since sample selection and respondent tracking costs would be minimal, the administrative costs of implementing a panel survey of districts and schools would most likely be no greater than the administrative costs associated with a repeated cross-sectional survey (with or without overlap). However, the development of a panel survey that fully maximizes the time dimension in its item structure would require considerable additional investments. In the SASS context, this would require extensive redesign. Taking full advantage of the panel survey design requires extensive item development efforts. Analyses of the SASS overlap sample (see Feasibility Study results below), using items which were simply repeated in subsequent SASS waves, over a three year span, indicated that there is not much basic structural change in schools (e.g., grade-span, school size, staff size). Probably most of the short-term change in schools has been in policies and practices. For example, NCES's study of tracking policies found that almost sixty percent of schools had changed their tracking policy in the last five years and about one half of schools were considering new modifications to schools (Carey, Fan-is, and Carpenter, A Feasibility Study of Longitudinal Design for Schools and Staffing Survey 1994). Changes in school operation, not structure, are how most reforms would be implemented, but operations of schools are hard to measure. Also they may change often, particularly in politically contested areas of schooling. Since the current SASS does not focus very much on the dynamics of school policy setting and operation, there would probably not be much added information from just repeating current SASS items to a full panel of schools. To make SASS items yield more information, particularly about policy and practices, extensive item re-design, especially for the proposed six-year spell between data collection waves would be necessary. For example, although it is not recommended here, one could propose to re-sample the entire 1993-94 sample, adding retrospective items on policy and practice changes related to specific reform issues such as school-based management. Developing relatively easy to answer items that will elicit valid responses, and that are retrospective to six-years on school operation for all of the different types of schools included in the full SASS sample would be a large and costly undertaking. Furthermore, items which require schools to dip into their institutional memory are easily prone to measurement error. Accordingly, valid items would take extra design efforts. In addition, there are response burden costs hidden in an extensive retrospective panel study. Items that are more sensitive to time issues usually require more response time. Finally, since respondent burden must be maintained at reasonable levels, the addition of new items would most likely require elimination of items measuring other factors. NCES would also face numerous other technical costs in conducting a panel study of schools. Far more is known about measurement error in the responses of panels of individuals than is known about the responses of panels of organizations (Kasprzyk et al. 1989). This is further complicated when the units are organizations like schools which may have different individuals serving as the designated respondent for different waves. Analyses of the SASS overlap sample showed there were a significant number of schools with a different principal (the designated respondent for the School Administrator Questionnaire and a possible respondent for the School Questionnaire) from one wave to the next. Following a panel of organizations like schools and attempting to collect complex information on these organizations represents a formidable design challenge (Col ledge 1989). Would the costs for significant longitudinal re-design be justified by the information payoff for NCES on the topic of reform? School organizational reform is politically important to a large part of the American educational establishment and the public. And as described in Pechman et al. (1996), many of the current reforms focus directly on the general areas of school management that SASS tried, in a limited way, to capture on the last two waves. As described above, longitudinal designs are useful for collecting information about the impact, the spread, and the variation in reforms in districts and schools. However, to justify the costs of a large, longitudinal re-design, NCES would have to be convinced that reports on the more complex nature of school change, as outlined above, are worth the investment. To maximize an investment in a longitudinal survey of schools on reform, NCES would also have to plan to invest in far more complex analyses and reports than it currently does."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "The specific recommendations below about re-designing SASS for a panel study of reform apply to the general question of the value of a panel study of schools for NCES. On the whole, the specific recommendations listed below caution against such an undertaking. Given the large amount of timerelated information already underutilized by the agency, it is difficult to argue that the added costs of a Although a longitudinal design for SASS would provide useful information on educational reform and would also strengthen NCES reporting capabilities, the re-design costs and the impact associated with changing questionnaire items mitigate against a full panel, longitudinal study for the entire SASS. Instead, small-scale, longitudinal designs that are alternatives to a full panel design should be considered as a way to capture important time variant information about reform practices. Operational costs for a panel design of districts and schools are not significantly higher than those for a repeated cross-sectional design. However, costs to re-design SASS items to take advantage of the time dimension of a panel design can be substantial. These new items may also impose a greater burden on respondents. It does not seem advisable to design retrospective items for any sample of 1993-94 schools. Instead, one should consider starting prospectively, either with a subsample of the 1993-94 as baseline, or with a subsample of the 1999-2000 as baseline. Organizational impact (outcomes) of reforms will be relatively hard to measure in SASS, regardless of the longitudinal nature of the design. But information on impetuses for reforms and implementations of policy and practices associated with many current reforms can be accurately collected."}, {"section_title": "H.

Similarly, the Public School Administrator Questionnaire, the other SASS Survey dealing with school related issues, asked about the following topic areas: Principal demographic characteristics Degrees earned, majors, year received -Teaching experience (years, last teaching assignment) Other As with the School Questionnaire, none of the above items were asked in identical ways across all three waves. And, as with the School Questionnaire, most of the noncomparabilities are associated with 1987-88 items. Appendices A and B provide comparisons of the item wordings used to measure similar constructs across the SASS waves. Since the 1990-91 and 1993-94 SASS surveys were the most comparable and contained a larger set of items than the 1987-88 survey, analyses focused on panel 2 and consisted of about 2,900 public schools. Some attempts were made to analyze comparable items in panel 3. Panel 3, the six year sample, was smaller and consisted of about 950 public schools.

Issues which Must Be Considered When Interpreting Longitudinal Findings", "text": "There are several technical issues related to using SASS data to conduct analyses over time. They illustrate potential problems in future analyses of partial panels of schools. In some cases the problems have obvious solutions, in other cases additional analyses were required. These issues include: Absence of new schools. By definition, no school less than 3 years old can be included in the panel 2 analyses; no school less than 6 years old, in the panel 3 analyses. Changes reported are generalizable to only the set of schools that have been in existence more than 3 (or 6) years, and may not be characteristic of newer schools. Salary items. Salaries can be converted to constant (e.g., 1993-94) dollars using inflation factors from Consumer Price Index for the various years. Student data. Whenever possible, both absolute size change and percentages (i.e., rather than the number of Chapter 1 students served, the percentage of students served by Chapter 1 programs; rather than number of graduates, a graduation rate based on the number of 12th graders enrolled in the previous year) will be reported. Non-comparability of items: Item wording. As previously indicated, numerous SASS items were modified in efforts to improve data quality. Unfortunately, any change in item wording may have effects on the responses elicited. If an item was functioning as intended, there would be no need for modification. The fact that an item was modified strongly suggests that there was a belief that the item was not working (for all respondents). Accordingly, when a new version of an item is developed, there is an expectation that it will elicit different (and more valid) responses from some respondents. So, the fact that an item has been reworded indicates that there is a strong expectation that, at least for some respondents, it will elicit a different response than the previous version.  Many believe that this will not be true for the wording of factual items. However, the literature clearly shows that factual items are also sensitive to wording and formatting effects. For example, principals who completed the School Administrator's Questionnaire (in both 1987-88 and 1990-91), were reinterviewed a few months after completion of the survey and readministered factual items about their education. In 1987-88, educational attainment was measured through the following item: Non-comparability of items: Context effects. Even when identical items are administered, it is not always possible to make similar comparisons over time. If there is a difference in the sequence in which some items were presented, item context effects may be manifest. An example of possible context effects is provided by the School Administrator Questionnaire item one asking about the extent to which various matters are a problem in the school. In the 1987-88 School Administrator Questionnaire, item 14 asks: NCES (1994). Quality Profile for SASS, Aspects of the Quality of Data in the Schools and Staffing Surveys (SASS).

The Schools and "}, {"section_title": "2'", "text": "For each of the following matters, indicate whether it is a serious problem, a moderate problem, a minor problem, or not a problem in your school. Thirteen items followed. In subsequent years, most of the same items were listed. However, additional items were added and some were deleted. Since most of the items were asked in subsequent waves, simple longitudinal comparisons of responses seem possible. Unfortunately, attitudinal items are sensitive to context effects. That is, the previous items in the list create a context (or set) and can strongly influence subsequent responses. Specifically, in the 1987-88 School Administrator Questionnaire, \"Physical abuse of teachers\" preceded \"Verbal abuse of teachers.\" In subsequent waves, \"Physical abuse of teachers\" was eliminated. It can be argued \"Physical abuse\" creates a context that minimizes the seriousness of \"Verbal abuse.\" So, if there were a decline in the perceived level to which \"Verbal abuse of teachers\" was a problem, it could be attributed to either a real change in school climate or to context effects. The literature is very clearpreceding items can strongly influence responses to subsequent items. Unfortunately, the literature does not allow one to estimate the magnitude of these effects a priori or to predict with certainty that they will occur. Dealing with non-comparability of items. To address this issue, it was assumed that context effects are randomly distributed among principals. This enabled comparisons of the decline in the level to which this was a problem in elementary schools vs. secondary schools and in urban vs. rural schools. So, if there was a substantial decline in one type of school (say, urban schools) relative to other types of schools, one could assert that this decline represented a real change in climate. However, if analyses by school characteristics show comparable declines across all the different types of schools, one cannot know (with certainty) if the decline is a context effect or a real decline. Another approach one might take to address this problem is a normalization approach. That is, one can look at the average, overall change across all items and then compare the change in a specific item with the overall change. This approach assumes that the entire list provides a context for respondents and that items appearing before and after the item of interest will contribute to contextual effects. (Although this has been demonstrated to occur, particularly in a self-administered questionnaire when the respondent reads the entire list or changes responses after completing subsequent items the impact of the immediately preceding items will be probably be greater for most respondents.) Interpretation of responses to the school decision making influence items must take into account the existence of context effects. These items, in 1987-88, asked about the influence of \"School district/Governing Board,\" \"Principal/Head,\" and \"Teachers.\" In 1990-91, the number of potential actors increased by three and \"School district/Governing Board\" became \"School Board.\" In 1993-94, the list of actors included two new categories and \"School district/Governing Board\" was broken up into two categories: \"School district staff' and \"School Board.\" These items are still valuable in identifying the types of schools in which change was the greatest. One has to be cautious about asserting that overall change has occurred for these items. Missing data.

This was done by merging the state education agency policy data, describing policy in 1992-93 (Levine and Huber man, 1996), with the longitudinal school change data derived from the 1990-91 and 1993-94 SASS School Administrator Questionnaire items dealing with influence of various groups on decision making. The basic question examined was: Does educational policy variation among the state policies have an effect on variation among schools in changes in their decision-making processes from 1990-91 to 1993-94? Figure 2 shows the analytic model used for this analysis. For each school in the longitudinal file, a dependent variable measured in the recent wave (1994) was regressed on the same variable measured in the earlier wave (1991), plus the state policy of interest, plus seven control variables. These other variables controlled for different school characteristics which might be related to organizational decision-making measures (urbanicity, region, enrollment size, percent minority students, school climate, whether the school changed principals over this time, and influence level in 1990-91). By controlling for the effect of the level of the dependent variable (influence level) at time one, this straightforward longitudinal model shows the effect that any other independent variable might have on change from 1991 to 1994 (Tuma and Hannan 1984). Xi=Other school characteristics Since organizational decision making was going to be analyzed, two state policy domains that would be expected to influence this decision making were identified. The first type related to the use of student test scores for school accountability. The second was a policy that attempts to foster and increase more school-based management (SBM). SBM policies also included several other policy dimensions such as the degree to which the SBM policy was integrated within the rest of the state department of education's school management policies and how recent the SBM policy was put into action in the state. There were five dependent variables, each representing the average influence (on a six point scale) a different governance actor has across the school's decisions in curriculum policy, teacher hiring policies, and student discipline policies. The actors included the state department of education, school board, principal, teachers, and the parent association. Higher values indicate greater levels of influence exerted by the actor on these decisions. These variables, as previously indicated, were collected from principals' perceptions of the decision-making environment that their schools function within. Results of these analyses are presented in Tables 16 and 17.\nRecent research has given considerable attention to the importance of school organizational characteristics in explaining teacher effectiveness and student outcomes (e.g., Hallinan, 1995). Work in this tradition has focused on a diverse set of organizational features, including the structure of the curriculum, teacher work conditions, the locus of decision making, the school climate, and the degree of consensus on goals and methods of instruction. While work on school organization holds promise in identifying school features associated with achievement, little is known about the ways school organizational features develop over time. In particular, almost no data are available to determine whether organizational features (such as the relative influence of various organizational actors on key decisions) are relatively stable features of schools, changing over a long time period, or whether they are relatively transient features, adjusting with changes in instructional and administrative staff or student composition. It also is not clear whether changes in organizational characteristics are more likely in some types of schools than others. I Most previous longitudinal studies, such as High School and Beyond and NELS:88, have focused on students as the primary unit of the analysis. However, with the exception of a recent follow-up study of High School and Beyond Schools (Levine, 1996), there is almost no analysis of school change with a large nationally representative sample. Data from the SASS Administrator and School Questionnaires were used to estimate the amount of organizational change that had occurred in each of the schools in the overlap sample of public schools. The extent to which the degree of observed change in school decision-making processes differed across states that have taken different approaches to educational reform was one of the foci of these examinations. The past two decades have witnessed a large volume of state policy-making activity in education, and different states have employed different strategies to encourage school improvement. One key dimension of variation across states is the degree of emphasis placed on school-based decision making. Some states like Hawaii and Colorado have given considerable emphasis to encouraging school-based management, while other states like Michigan and Virginia have given these policies much less attention. States also vary in the emphasis given to accountability policies, policies encouraging or requiring schools to report routinely on student achievement, graduation rates, and other key outcomes. These two reform strategies might be expected to have different effects on school organization. Stevenson and Schiller (1997), for example, argue that school-based management is an \"exhortatory policy,\" based on professional images of the form a reform-oriented school should take. One might expect such policies to diffuse through professional networks. Accountability policies, on the other hand, involve an emphasis on school outputs rather than procedures. The effects of accountability policies on school organization are difficult to predict. Hence, as Stevenson and Schiller argue, we should expect stronger, more consistent effects of statewide school-based management policies on school organization than statewide accountability policies. Table 16 presents a summary of the effects of state policies from the twenty-five ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions. There are several major conclusions from this analysis about the effects of state policies on changes in school decision-making processes.  , 1980-1993: The National Longitudinal Study of Schools. Palo Alto: American Institutes for Research, 1997. NOTE: Cell entries are OLS coefficients; + means \"positive significant\"; means \"negative significant\"; N.S. means \"not significant\". First, as predicted, accountability policy intensifies the tendency for state departments of education to have greater impact upon school's managerial decisions. However, accountability polices have no effects on the rest of the actors studied in the education decision-making process. These kinds of state policies are not associated with any changes in the level of influence of school boards, principals, teachers, or parent associations on school operations. Accountability policies increase school's sensitivity to state governance but not to other stakeholders in the education system. In a sense, accountability tightens one of the usually loosely coupled links between authority and the organizational production in education, but it has little influence on other links. Second, the same is almost true for SBM policies. If a state has an explicit SBM policy, schools tend to see an increase in the influence of state department of education on their day-tolday operations. The irony of this finding is discussed below. However, unlike the effects of accountability policies, state SBM policies tend to lower the influence of district school boards on school decision-making. Further, contrary to what might be predicted about policies that attempt to increase school level actors' influence on decision making, a state SBM policy did not have an effect on the influence of principals, teachers,"}, {"section_title": "E. Results and Discussion", "text": "Gross Structural Change Analyses Excluding schools that added or dropped prekindergarten programs, 83 percent of the longitudinal schools had the same grade structures in 1990-91 and 1993-94. Changes in grade structure were apparently implemented in response to changing demographics and school policy. Some longitudinal schools underwent a major shift in the grade levels they served. Using longitudinal data, it is possible to estimate how many have done this and how substantial the changes were. Changes in the organizational structure of a school that underwent a major shift in grade levels served probably reflected the impact of the grade level shift more than anything else. Schools that had such radical changes should probably be analyzed separately and excluded from further analyses. Accordingly, changes and stability in enrollments, faculty, and student/teacher ratios were examined in schools that had the same grade structures in 1990-91 and 1993-94 (see table 1). These changes reflected demographic changes during the given time period.  (see table 2). Similarly, combined schools were more likely to change principals than elementary or secondary schools (54 percent versus 44 percent). Accordingly, a variable indicating whether a school changed its principal was introduced in our multivariate analysis of principal reporting on decision making to control for the potential effects of different respondents. These preliminary analyses also showed that principal succession was more likely in schools with minority enrollments in excess of 20 percent (49 percent versus 44 percent in other schools). Descriptive Analyses of Other School Characteristics and Analyses to Identify Patterns among Schools in Terms of Organizational Change and Stability During the three-year period between the 1990-91 and the 1993-94 school years, as previously noted, schools had relatively little change in their grade structure. They had more change in terms of leadership (see table 2) and their principal's perception of influence over school policy by various groups (see tables 3-8).   Preliminary results on general school change indicate that, overall, the kinds of organizational characteristics that were measured were relatively stable features of schools, at least over the three-year period of our study. However, substantial changes in several other characteristics were observed, especially in the degree of influence of parents, teachers, and principals over decisions about curriculum and instruction (see tables 3-8). Furthermore, preliminary results indicate that change in organizational characteristics is related to school context. For example, an increase in teacher influence between 1990-91 and 1993-1994 was more likely in some types of schools (e.g., schools with lower minority enrollment) than in others. Total student enrollment (see table 1), student/teacher ratio (see table 1), high school graduation rate  (see table 9), and college application rate (see table 9) stayed rather constant. Overall, the school environment had changed relatively little. The 1990-91 and 1993-94 SASS School Administrator Questionnaires asked principals to report on how serious 20 different problems were in their schools (see tables 10-15). These problems included basic and behavior standards; involvement; attendance; and respect for teacher, students, and property. On a 4-point scale, the biggest changes were a reduction of .15 scale units for \"physical conflicts among students\" and declines of .10 scale units for \"student possession of weapons\" and \"racial tension.\"      Compared to their perception of school environment, principals' perception of influence over school policy by various groups (state department of education, school board, principal, teacher, and parent association) has changed relatively more during the same time period. Principals reported that teachers and parent associations have more influence over school policies regarding establishing curriculum, hiring new full-time teachers, and setting school policy. These preliminary results suggest that the collection of data on school organization for a longitudinal sample can contribute to our understanding of school organization and school change, and that important conclusions can be drawn from panel data that cannot be derived from trend data alone. Further work is needed to identify the most promising school organization measures to include in future panel studies and to determine the most appropriate sampling plan. In particular, attention must be given to the appropriate time interval between data collections in future panel studies, and the number of periods over which data should be collected for each school in the sample."}, {"section_title": "40", "text": "A heasibility Study of Longitudinal Design for Schools and Staffing Survey or parent associations.

Higher influence scores indicate greater amounts of influence. Why should a state SBM policy not increase the decision-making power of teachers and parents groups? To examine this further an index that measured the degree to which SBM policies were integrated into a State's approach to the management of schools was constructed. States can just proclaim a SBM policy and not connect it to other policies that bring it into practice, or states can take a more integrated approach to SBM. Or, states may not even have an explicitly stated SBM policy, but may have adapted other related policy that fits a general SBM approach. The index captured a wider array of state policies that might have an impact on SBM. The effects of the variable are summarized in the third column (\"School-based management integrated policy\") of table 16. Schools in states with an east I rty tu y o sng:tus:na esign or c oo s an 51 a ing urvey I integrated SBM policy still tended to perceive an increase in influence from the state department of education and a lowering of influence of the district administration over the three-year time span. But, more in line with the intentions of a SBM approach, both teachers and parent association groups gained influence over time in states with integrated policies. Third, since the state policy study examined when various policies were adopted by states, we can examine the effect of recent SBM policies versus older or no SBM policies. Since recent reforms have pushed SBM philosophies to such a large extent, we predicted that recent SBM policies might have more salient effects on changes in school decision-making. And the results indicate precisely that. Schools in states with recently adopted SBM policies have increased both teachers' and parent association group's influence on decisions and decreased the influence of the school board. (see Table   16.) Fourth, to examine further the dynamics of governance policy and school change, we constructed an interaction term between the integrated SBM index and the timing of adoption of a SBM policy. States that have recent, integrative SBM policies expanded the influence of teachers in school decision making. And this model (not shown completely in figure 2) also indicates that after controlling for this joint effect, states which had just recently adopted an SBM policy, but without any integration of this policy into other management policies, had decreases in teacher influence on decision making. An interaction between an integrated policy and its timing only had an effect on teachers. Accountability policies had the predicted impact; namely, they increased the influence of the state department of education on schools. Surprisingly, SBM policies did this too. There is some irony in the finding that a policy intended to focus more decision-making involvement of the school results in greater influence of the state department of education. One way to think about this is to consider where most of the bureaucratization of schooling comes from in the American system of education and how a SBM policy would have an impact on that. The extensive local nature of schooling in the United States means that many administrative processes pile up at the school district level. And although there are some 15,000 school districts, many of these are very small, serving small populations of schools and students. Consequently, most schools are a part of the larger school districts in the nation. Since administrative size has long been known to be associated with more centralized management processes, the school district is likely the greatest obstacle to increasing decision-making power at the school level. This makes sense considering our findings that state SBM policies do decrease the influence of the school boards. And in doing that the state's department of education may elevate their own influence on schools along with increasing the influence of teachers and parents. Another way to think about this ironic effect is that policies can often have unintended effects, particularly when they are not well integrated in administrative practices. If a state publicly and loudly proclaims its embrace of SBM principles, but does not do much to integrate them into actual practices, schools could perceive a greater influence of the state department but never reap the benefits of greater decision-making power. This is the difference between the effects we find for a stated policy only versus one that is integrated into a set of policies."}, {"section_title": "A Feasibility Study of Longitudinal Design for Schools and Staffing Survey 43", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusions", "text": "Longitudinal data from the SASS overlap sample can be used to provide indications of how schools have changed.

Many of these ideas originate from the in-progress ESSI feasibility study that analyzes the \"overlap 1990-91 and 1993-94 SASS sample,\" (i.e. Baker forthcoming). Before I present my thoughts and recommendations on these issues, I will briefly describe the capability of the current, cross-sectional SASS to study schooling over time. SASS has used a newly drawn sample of districts and schools for each of its three data collections; or, in other words, SASS is three separate cross-sectional surveys collected three years apart. But, although successive surveys have added new items, many of the same items have been collected at each wave. Therefore, unlike a one-time survey, SASS is a repeated, cross-sectional survey that can provide national and state estimates of variables at different points in time (i.e. simple trends). But because different schools are surveyed, the SASS cannot provide information on the dynamics of educational change at the school and district levels. Even though this is true for the full SASS public school sample, there is the capability in SASS to provide.some information on a subset of schools over time. To reduce sampling error, the 1990-91 and 1993-94 SASSs purposefully sampled a number (about 30%) of districts and schools that had been surveyed in the previous SASS wave. Although this so-called \"overlap sample\" has never been used for substantive reporting, data from responses to the school questionnaire provide a view of what a longitudinal, panel (i.e. same schools over time) study might yield on the SASS items developed for a cross-sectional survey. (See the attached description of the feasibility study of the overlap sample.)"}, {"section_title": "I.", "text": "What questions could a longitudinal survey of K-12th grade schools answer about reform? Regardless of whether one or many reforms are of interest, there are at least two basic questions about reform that longitudinal information on districts or schools could help to answer: 1. What is the pattern of implementation of reformed school policies and practices across place and time? 2. What school outcomes, if any, are attributable to reforms? In the case of the first question, longitudinal information would enhance the quality of the answer that a cross-sectional survey could provide. For examples, while the cross-section SASS could provide information on the numbers of schools which use school-based management procedures, a longitudinal study would provide detailed information on which schools changed to more (or less) school-based management over a specific time period. But in the case of the second question, some type of a longitudinal design would be essential to providing a valid answer. Without pre-reform measures of outcomes such as achievement, teacher satisfaction, drop-out rates, and so forth for schools, attributing effects to reformed practices becomes questionable."}, {"section_title": "II.", "text": "What are the relative costs and benefits of a longitudinal design for information on education reform in SASS? Benefits: Without a doubt there is an initial attractiveness of longitudinal study of reform. The notion of collecting useful information on the adoption and impact of educational reform of American schools is easily tied to considering some sort of a longitudinal survey design. Even the simplest of over time designs, such as following a penal across just two times points, has a clear appeal and usefulness in assessing the impact of new practices. Reforms are really changes in operating policy and practice, and thus they can be thought of as quasi-experimental treatments whose impact can be assessed by comparing a school's functioning before and after implementation (question 2 above). And of course, there are more elaborate longitudinal designs available to compare reformed schools with unreformed schools over time. Besides impact of reform, longitudinal designs also come to mind when considering ways to gather information on impetus for reforms and their implementation across districts and schools (question 1 above). The political environments of districts and schools are complex and the impetus for reform comes from a variety of sources without much, if any, centralized policy-setting in the nation. Therefore, although the national reform message may be more or less clear, reform is locally adopted and implemented. Within some broad common understanding of any single reform, corresponding policy and practice changes will rarely, if ever, be uniform across the numerous LEA's and schools. Some districts and schools will adopt reform while others will not, and the timing of adoption will vary as well. Also, among those that choose to adopt reform, actual implementation can take different forms. Thus, although national education politics often produce pressure for educational change, the results of this pressure, falling upon a localized system, can yield substantial variation in reformed practice from location to location over time. Examining implementation over time across a panel of districts and/or schools is an attractive way to gather useful information on how reforms spread across the nation. This kind of reasoning has motivated recommendations to NCES for longitudinal approaches to other parts of its statistical portfolio (e.g. . The argument is that full-blown, multiple-waved longitudinal designs provide more information, and dynamically richer information, than simple crosssections. This is true. Compared to a repeated, cross-sectional survey, a longitudinal panel of schools should provide a richer array of information. Even though SASS yields some basic information on trends over time and this could be exploited more effectively than it currently is, what is missing is more complex information on the dynamics of school change. Information such as which schools implemented a reform, how often during the time spell did they change practices, and what were the antecedents of adopting a reform is only provided through panel designs. Also the whole question of outcomes, as described above, is answered more rigorously with panel data. Another repeated cross-section of SASS, even without any longitudinal component, could provide some important reform information on adoption of reforms. But without some type of longitudinal design, the richer, and perhaps the more valuable, information on change related to reform will not be provided. Thus, in the abstract, longitudinal designs are hard to reject. It is akin to trying to argue in principle against larger and more stratified samples. Given the obvious attraction of longitudinal designs for collecting Costs: One problem is the cost of redesigning items and of increased response burden for a longitudinal design as applied to specific issues of reform in SASS. SASS is not a new survey and there are many items which need to be handled with some continuity. Any longitudinal design examining specific reform issues will have to be worked into the existing SASS structure and this presents some obstacles Operational costs of a longitudinal survey of districts and schools would probably not be significantly higher than those of the current design, but there could be some additional costs to a longitudinal design. Further, costs to develop items that maximize the time dimension of a longitudinal design on reform can be considerable. What has been clear so far from the analysis of the SASS overlap sample (see attached Feasibility Study Results), which just repeated the SASS cross-sectional items over a three year span, is that there is not much basic structural change in schools (i.e. grad-span, school size, staff size). Probably most of the short-term change in schools is in policies and practices. For example, NCES's study of tracking policies found that schools within a five year period often changed their tracking practices (Carey, Farris, and Carpenter, 1994); almost sixty percent of schools had changed their tracking policy in the last five years and about one half of schools were considering new modifications. Changes in school operation, not structure, are precisely where most implemented reforms would exist, but operations of schools are hard to measure. Also they may change often, particularly in politically contested areas of schooling. Since the current SASS does not focus very much on the dynamics of school policy setting and operation, there would probably not be much added information from just repeating current SASS items to a full panel of schools. To make SASS items yield more information, particularly about policy and practices, would require extensive redesign, especially for the proposed six-year spell between data collection waves. For example, although its not recommended here, one could propose to resample the entire 1993-94 sample, adding retrospective items on policy and practice changes related to specific reform issues such as school-based management. Developing answerable, six-year retrospective items on school operation for all of the different types of schools included in the full SASS sample would be a large, and perhaps costly, undertaking. Items which require schools to dip into their institutional memory are easily prone to measurement error, therefore, valid items would take extra design efforts. Further there are response burden costs hidden in an extensive retrospective panel study. Items which are more sensitive to time issues usually require more response time, often significantly so.\nAre the costs worth the benefits? Would the costs for significant longitudinal redesign be worth it in terms of information payoff for NCES? Certainly school organizational reform is politically important to a large part of the American educational establishment and the public. And as described in , many of the current reforms focus directly on the general areas of school management that SASS tried, in a limited way, to capture on the last two waves. Also as described above, longitudinal designs have some appeal to collecting information to answer key questions about the impact, the spread, and variation in reforms in districts and schools. But at the same time, to justify the costs of a large, longitudinal redesign, NCES would have to be convinced that reports on the more complex nature of school change, as outlined above, are worth the investment. Keep in mind too, that in the past the agency has not taken full advantage of the longitudinal nature of its surveys of students. To maximize an investment in a longitudinal survey of schools on reform, NCES would have to plan to produce far more complex analyses and reports than it currently does. IV. Are there alternative designs? It may be better to consider some alternatives to a full SASS panel design. Instead of undertaking the costs to redesign the entire SASS to be an effective longitudinal survey on reform and other issues, perhaps NCES should consider smaller-scale, focused studies built upon the large cross-section school sample of SASS. While there would still be some design costs associated with developing useful items, a smaller, more focused approach to gathering school reform information over time might be more manageable. For example, in the curricular tracking FRSS, a smaller, nationally representative sample of public high schools (n=990) that had participated in the 1990-91 SASS collection was surveyed in 1993 as to their tracking policies and practices. The questionnaire included some explicitly longitudinal items on tracking, such as how often a school's tracking policy had been modified in the last five years. And the survey could have included many more, such as specific histories of policy change. All of the other considerable information about each school from the SASS collection was available for analysis of the tracking issues. (The analysis of the overlap sample shows that most of the demographics and the basic organization of schools does not change over three years.) A similar design could be considered for reform issues. A small subset of schools from the full SASS sample could be resurveyed, perhaps annually, with a focus on reform issues. Almost all of the response time could be dedicated to the reform issues, thus keeping response burden relatively low. Also designing a special questionnaire, to be administered at a different time, to a smaller set of schools, will probably require less effort than trying to place longitudinal items within the main SASS data collection for all schools. Of course, this smaller sample would not support state level estimates. But here too NCES should consider some alternatives. Some selection of useful comparisons across a small number of states as to reform issues might serve as the basis of a small longitudinal add-on to SASS."}, {"section_title": "V.", "text": "If some alternative longitudinal design is used, what are the other design issues that need to be considered? 1. Which SASS sample should an alternative study begin with? There are two alternatives. One could resample part of the 1993-94 SASS school sample and develop new reform items. This could be done as a focused FRSS-type survey before the 1999-2000 collection and then be followed-up as part of the main 1999-2000 collection and then again in the 2005 SASS. Selected schools would provide only current reform information instead of retrospective information back to 1993-94, but the basic SASS structural information from 1993-94 could be used. Some baseline implementation information could be ready even before the 1999-2000 SASS, but any outcome information would still have to wait until after 1999-2000 collection. The advantage is that this provides A Feasibility Study of Longitudinal Design for Schools and Staffing Survey 77 86 some information soon, but with the cost of adding a significant design task that is concurrent with the planning of the rest of the next SASS. The other option is to start any alternative studies with the 1999-2000 collection. This means a longer wait for both implementation and outcome information, but provides more time to think through design and content issues. 2. Which kinds of schools should a study include? Although this question is not necessarily related to whether or not some sort of longitudinal design should be used to collect information on reforms, it is worth considering here too. Most of the reform debates have been aimed at the public sector of K-12 schooling. Although the private sector has played a role in the debate as points of comparisons, not much if anything has been said about whether current reforms with have an impact on private schools. Regardless of the prevailing myths, private schools may need reforms too. Also, as a recent SASS report indicates, large portions of the private sector are organizationally, and perhaps operationally, not much different from large portions of the private sector are organizationally, and perhaps operationally, not much different from large portions (Baker et al. 1996) of the public sector. Thus current reforms could be relevant to many private schools. Further, SASS has always reported on the full range of schools public and private, including all types of private schools and public schools such as schools for Native Americans. But the diversity of private schools might make it difficult to develop useable items on reforms. 3. Broad versus focused reforms? Another design issue to be considered is which reforms? A focused smaller study lends itself to covering just a few key reform issues."}, {"section_title": "National versus state?", "text": "As mentioned above, it would not be possible in a smaller sample to have representative samples from each state. Rather certainly nationally representative samples are crucial, and if there are resources available, a selected number of states that yield interesting comparisons might be useful."}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "text": "Although some sort of longitudinal design for SASS would provide useful information on educational reform, both the hidden design costs and loss of continuity in the cross-sectional time series probably does not warrant a full panel, longitudinal study for the entire SASS. Instead, small-scale, longitudinal designs that are alternatives to a full panel design should be considered as a way to capture some important time varying information on reform. Operational costs for a panel design of districts and schools are not significantly higher than those for a repeated cross-section design, but costs to re-design SASS items to take advantage of the time dimension of a panel design can be substantial. Also truly longitudinal items may significantly increase response burden. It is probably not worth the effort to design retrospective items for any sample of 1993-94 schools, rather start prospectively, either with a sub-sample of the 1993-94 as baseline, or with a subsample of the 1999-2000 as baseline. Organizational impact (outcomes) of reforms will be relatively hard to measure in SASS, regardless of the longitudinal nature of the design. But information on impetuses and implementations of policy and practice associated with many current reforms can be accurately collected, and some longitudinal component would strengthen NCES reporting capabilities."}]
