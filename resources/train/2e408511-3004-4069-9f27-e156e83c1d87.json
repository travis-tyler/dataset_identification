The results were the separation between a reference ellipsoid and tidal datums along a scheduled ferry route that were computed from water-level predictions. The predictions were based on tidal harmonic constituents resolved from GPS-observed water-level heights. This research focused on the Mean Sea Level (MSL) and Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) tidal datums because of their importance in geodesy and hydrographic surveying for nautical charts in the US. These ellipsoid-to-tidal datum separations are the parameters necessary for transforming GPS heights to tidal datums. The transformation parameters reduce a hydrographers reliance on shore-based tide stations. FIG Publication NO 37 (FIG, 2006) shows that if the ellipsoid-to-Chart Datum (MLLW in the US) separation is known hydrographic surveys can be conducted without directly measuring tides (Figure 1). FIG Special Publication NO 37 shows that traditionally sounding depths on a nautical chart are computed using the equation on the left of Figure 1 where, S is the sounding depth, D is the depth of the water measured by the transducer, Tx is the heave of the vessel, and T is the height of the tide above Chart Datum (CD). FIG Special Publication NO 37 further explains that when soundings are referenced to an ellipsoid the non-tide formula, shown on the right of Figure 1, is used to compute the sounding depth. The heave and tide parameters in the traditional formula are replaced by the height of the antenna above the transducer (K), of the antenna above the reference ellipsoid (/-/), and the ellipsoid-to-CD separation (A/). It should be noted that in geodesy the variable N represents the Geoid undulation, which is the separation between the Geoid and reference ellipsoid. For the purposes of this research N represents the separation between chart datum and a reference ellipsoid, which is different from the Geoid undulation. N varies spatially, an example of this is illustrated in Figure 2, which shows the height MLLW in Saint John, NB and 74 km southeast in Digby, NS. Because N varies spatially, it must be either modeled or computed from waterlevel heights directly referenced to an ellipsoid. For smaller areas N is often assumed constant. It is relatively easy to derive N at a location onshore, especially if a tide station with tidal benchmarks has already been established. A static GPS observation of a tidal benchmark provides the height of the benchmark above the reference ellipsoid. The ellipsoid height and the CD height of the benchmark can then be used to compute N. Locations offshore pose a more difficult problem, because there are no benchmarks and the environment is dynamic. There are two approaches used for determining N at offshore locations. One approach is to compute CD from water-level heights directly referenced to an ellipsoid. The second approach is to model N at locations offshore by interpolating between N measured at locations onshore. The data used in this research to answer this question was collected Fundy . To date, the data collected during this project has contributed to research on improving estimates of tropospheric delay of the GPS signal using a Numerical Weather Prediction model Cove, 2005;Nievinski et al., 2005), the UNB3 model (Kim et. al., 2004), nullifying ionospheric delay (Kim and Langley, 2005), and for assessing hydrodynamic models in the Bay of Fundy (Church, 2008). The Princess of Acadia GPS Project used the Princess of Acadia ferry to obtain a spatially diverse set of water-level observations. The advantage of using the ferry as a sampling platform instead of a traditionally site specific waterlevel measurement system is that the ferry transits back and forth between Saint John, NB and Digby, NS 1 to 3 times a day. Thus, it efficiently measures instantaneous water-levels over a large spatial region. One of the challenges of using the Princess of Acadia as a platform for measuring tides is that the sampling interval at any particular location along the ferry's track varies with the frequency of the ferry crossings, which varies from day-to-day and season-toseason. Another challenge is that the ferry takes approximately 3 hrs to transit the 75 km distance between Saint John, NB and Digby, NS. Therefore, even during the busiest month, when the frequency of ferry crossings is at its highest, the period between crossings periodically exceeds the Nyquist sampling interval for resolving the predominant tidal constituent (M2) in the bay from an equally spaced time series.

The model disregards friction, inertia, and the irregular distribution of the land masses of the Earth. The theoretical tide formed under these conditions is known as the equilibrium tide (CO-OPS, 2000) The equilibrium tide theory provides a priori knowledge of the frequencies that contribute tidal energy to a time series of water-level observations (Parker, 2007). The amplitude and phase of these frequencies can be used to predict water-levels, which can then be used to model tidal datums such as MLLW and MSL. MSL is of particular importance, because it allows validation of the Geoid. The Geoid is a model of an equipotential gravity surface that best fits MSL on a global scale (Torge, 2001). There are differences between the Geoid and the observed MSL surface because of water density gradients, ocean currents and varying meteorological conditions (Pugh, 2004). Globally, the maximum differences between the Geoid and MSL are about +/-1m (Torge, 2001) Tides develop from pulling (gravitational force) and pushing (centrifugal force) of the water on the surface of the earth by the Moon and the Sun (Parker, 2007). Pugh (2004) has shown, using Newton's physical laws, that the gravitational force a celestial body has on the Earth's oceans is inversely proportional to the cube of the distance the body is from the Earth and directly proportional to the mass of the celestial body (Parker, 2007). Thus, even though the Sun is 27.1 million times larger than the moon the gravitation force imposed on the Earth's surface by the Sun is 0.46 times weaker than that of the Moon because the Sun is 389 times farther from the Earth than the Moon is (Pugh, 2004). Because the gravitational forces developed by the Moon are much larger than the gravitational forces developed by the Sun the remainder of the discussion will focus on the earth-moon system. However, the reader should understand that the discussion is also valid for the earth-sun system. The earth and moon orbit around the center of mass of the earth-moon system. This common axis of rotation is called the barycenter. The barycenter lies just inside the surface of the Earth (Boon, 2004). The centrifugal force created by this rotation is the force that balances the gravitational forces of the system. The gravitational force and the centrifugal force are equally balanced at the center of the Earth (Parker, 2007). For a point on the Earth's surface that is closer to the Moon than the center of the Earth, the gravitational force will be larger than the centrifugal force. The opposite is true for a point on the Earth's surface that is farther from the Moon than the center of the Earth. The net result of the gravitational and centrifugal forces resulting from the earth-moon system and the earth-sun system are the tide generating forces (Figure 4).  The tide generating force of the moon is 0.0000034 times the gravitational force of the Earth (Boon, 2004). For points on the Earth's surface that are off the Moon's orbital plane there is a horizontal component to the tide generating force (Boon, 2006). This horizontal component is the force vector that moves the oceans on the Earth's surface towards the locations on the Earth's surface that are on the Moon's orbital plane (Parker, 2007). There are two such locations. One is located on the side of the Earth that is closest to the moon, where the gravitational force of the Moon is larger than the centrifugal force of the earthmoon system. The other is located on the side of the earth that is farthest from the Moon where the centrifugal force of the earth-moon system is larger than the  gravitational force of the Moon (Figure 4). The attraction of the water in earth's oceans to these two locations results in two bulges of water. These bulges are referred to as either tidal bulges (Parker, 2007) or the tidal envelope (Hicks, 2006).   (Forrester, 1983). The preceding discussion focused on the tidal envelope developed by the Moon. However, there is also a tidal envelope developed by the Sun (Hicks, 2006). The tidal forces generated by the Sun are smaller than those generated by the Moon thus the solar tide envelop is smaller than the lunar tide envelop. Also, the points on the Earth's surface that are on the Sun's orbital plane are not usually the same points that are on the Moon's orbital plane. The net result of the solar and lunar tide envelopes is the composite tidal envelope (Hicks, 2006). The size of the composite envelope is not constant, which is one of the factors contributing to the spatial variability in the tides that are observed on earth. The composite envelope is not constant because the tidal forces generated by the Moon and the Sun vary with the distance they are from the Earth and their orientation with respect to the Earth. Stacy D. Hicks (2006) describes the orbits of the Moon and the Earth as follows. During the Moon's elliptical orbit around the Earth the point at which it is closest to the Earth is called perigee and the point at which it is farthest from the Earth is called apogee. At perigee the Moon is 132,600 km from the Earth. At apogee the moon is 151,800 km from the Earth. The perigee-to-perigee cycle is called the anomalistic month and has a period of 27.55455 days ( Figure 7). The elliptical shape of the Moon's orbit around the Earth also varies, which results in a change of the location at which perigee occurs. The period over which it takes the location of perigee to complete a cycle is 8.847 years (Parker, 2007).  Hicks (2006) describes the elliptical orbit of the Earth around the Sun to vary by 1,867,351 km over a period of 365.2596 days. When the Earth is closet to the Sun it is considered to be in perihelion. When it is farthest from the Sun it is considered to be in aphelion ( Figure 7). The amount of time it takes the Earth to complete a perihelion-to-perihelion cycle is called the anomalistic year. Changes in declination of the Earth, the Moon, and the Sun are measured with respect to the ecliptic (Figure 8). The ecliptic is the plane defined by the orbit of the Earth around the center of mass of the earth-sun system (Hicks, 2006). The Earth's axis of rotation has a maximum declination of 23.452\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic. The summer solstice in the northern hemisphere marks the point at which the northern hemisphere is closest to the Sun. This is also the point that the Sun is at its maximum declination with respect to the Earth's equator. A quarter of its orbit after summer solstice in the northern hemisphere the Sun is directly above the equator. One-quarter of an orbit later the northern hemisphere is now farthest from the Sun marking winter solstice in the northern hemisphere and the point at which the Sun is at its maximum declination south of the Earth's equator (Hicks, 2006). As described by Parker (2007), the orbital plane of the Moon around the Earth is inclined to the Earth's equator. The maximum angle between the Moon's orbital plane and the Earth's equator is 5\u00b0 and it takes 18.6 years for this angle to go from 5\u00b0 north of the earth's equator to 5\u00b0 south then back to 5\u00b0 north (Parker, 2007). During this time the position at which the Moon crosses the ecliptic changes. These positions are called lunar nodes. The changes in their position is called the regression of the lunar nodes because their position moves in the opposite direction from which the Earth revolves around its axis, the Moon orbits around the Earth, and the Earth rotates around the Sun (Parker, 2007) ( Figure 9).  These variations in distance and declination of the Earth, the Moon, and the Sun control the size of the composite tidal envelope. Cartwright (2000) points out that the periods of the cycles that define these variations have been clearly defined by early astronomers. Linear combinations of the frequencies of these cycles are called tidal harmonic frequencies and are used to describe tidal behavior (Parker, 2007). The period of the six primary cycles that are used to derive the tidal harmonic frequencies are listed in Table 1. The periods listed in Table 1 are the primary benefit of the equilibrium tidal theory because they can be used to derive the tidal frequencies that are used in tidal harmonic analyses. "}, {"section_title": "Harmonic Analysis Method of Least-Squares (HAMELS)", "text": "The equilibrium tide theory discussed in the previous section is a description of how the sea-surface would behave assuming nothing restricts or constrains the water in the oceans from instantaneously responding to the tide generating forces (Pugh, 2004). This assumption is an over simplification because the response of the water in the oceans is restricted by bottom friction and constrained by coastlines (Parker, 2007). These restrictions and constraints dissipate energy from a propagating tidal wave and can transfer energy from one tidal frequency to another (Parker, 2007). The tidal dynamics resulting from these energy changes and shifts result in non-linear effects that are modeled using a hydrodynamic model or by using overtides and compound tides in a harmonic analysis (Parker, 2007 Boon (2004). This method models non-linear effects using shallow-water tidal frequencies. Although the equilibrium tide is a simplification of this complex ocean's response, it still provides the foundation for developing a prediction model in the form of a linear combination of a set of harmonic functions (Boon, 2004) The coefficients for equation 1are obtained using a least-squares procedure that minimizes the squared difference between a height estimate and the observed height, and are appropriate for use only at the location of the observed heights. Each of the tidal constituents resolved in the least-squares procedure have a unique amplitude (R) and phase ($ of harmonic constituent. R and <t> are obtained from the coefficients for the prediction model using the equations below: The uncertainty of the amplitude and phase of a constituent is governed by the sampling interval of the signal, the length of the record, the number of constituents used in the analysis and the amount of noise in the record (Parker, 2007). For evenly-spaced time-series the sampling interval (At) defines the highest frequency for which the amplitude and phase can be resolved (Boon, 2004). This frequency is defined as f c = 1/(2At) where f c is the Nyquist or 'cutoff' frequency (Boon, 2004). Analyses of even-spaced time-series at frequencies higher than the Nyquist frequency result in false frequency detections (Boon, 2004). False detections are high-frequency signals that appear in the lowfrequency part of the spectrum and are referred to as aliased signals (Scargle, 1982). Press et. al. (1992) showed, using spectral analysis methods for unevenly spaced data, that when some samples in an unevenly sampled dataset are spaced much closer than the average sample interval, frequencies above the Nyquist frequency can be correctly identified. In fact, Scargle (1982) reports that uneven spacing provides an advantage when aliasing is a problem. Thus, with a priori knowledge of the tidal harmonic frequencies that contribute to the signal at a location, the number of frequencies used in a harmonic analysis is reduced. Also, uneven sample intervals allow for the tidal harmonic frequencies higher than the average sample interval to be resolved (Scargle, 1982). In order to resolve the individual contribution of two different harmonic constituents, the length of the record being analyzed must be equal to the synodic period (T) of the two constituents (Parker, 2007). This period is the amount of time it takes the two constituents to go from being in-phase to being out-of-phase and back to being in-phase. The synodic period of two constituents is determined using the Rayleigh criterion T>-where f x and / 2 are the frequencies in cycles per day (cpd) of the tidal harmonic constituents to be uniquely identified (Parker, 2007). For example, the frequency of the principal semi-diurnal lunar (M2) and principal semi-diurnal solar (S2) constituents is 1.9323 cpd and 2.000 cpd, respectively. Thus, the synodic period, 7, for M2 and "}, {"section_title": "Water-level Measurement Systems", "text": "There are many approaches to measuring water-levels. The ones used in this research were float/pulley gauges, a strain gauge and a GPS buoy. Float/pulley gauges have been the standard water-level measurement system for the past 150-years (Pugh, 2004). These systems consist of a wire with a float at one end. The wire goes through a series of pulleys and gears. Attached to the other end of the wire is a counter weight. The float, which rests on the water, goes up and down with the changes of the water-level. The pulleys and gears are connected to electronic devices that record the changes in the gearing induced by the moving float and counterweight. A strain gauge is a pressure gauge that has an oscillating crystal for sensing pressure changes. The pressure changes are recorded digitally. Some strain gauges record the combined pressure of the water column and the air above the water column (Pugh, 2004). In order to convert the pressure measurements to depth atmospheric pressure must be accounted for along with water density and gravity (Pugh, 2004). Other strain gauges are vented to the atmosphere, thus water density and gravity are the parameters necessary for converting pressure to depth.  (Seeber, 2003). The user segment consists of a GPS receiver connected to an antenna and a person to operate it."}, {"section_title": "General overview of GPS system", "text": "GPS satellites transmit two signals on two different carrier frequencies. These carrier frequencies are L1 and L2. L1 is a 1575 MHz electromagnetic signal that is modulated by 2 binary digital codes (Wells, 1987). The L2 signal is a 1228 MHz electromagnetic signal that is modulated by 1 binary digital code (Wells, 1987). The digital codes are sequences of 0 or 1, where 0 represents no phase reversal of the carrier and 1 represents a phase reversal (Wells, 1987). The fundamental concept of GPS positioning is based on the one-way travel time of radio waves. GPS receivers use a priori knowledge of the exact signal generated in the satellite to duplicate the signal internally. The phase offset between the signal generated in the receiver and the one received from a satellite gives the travel time. Neglecting propagation errors, the product of the travel time and the speed of light give the slant range between the receiver and a satellite. Because this range is affected by satellite and receiver clock errors, orbit errors and atmospheric delay, it is called the pseudorange. Conceptually, the intersection point of three spheres of radius equal to the pseudorange to three different satellites gives the position of the receiver (Seeber, 2003). In practice GPS position fixes are determined by a least-squares fit of predicted pseudoranges to measured pseudoranges for all satellites above the horizon, or above a specific elevation angle (Wells, 2008a)."}, {"section_title": "Tidal Datums", "text": "The procedures described in this section and used in this research are those used by NOAA. water-level data in support of their congressional assignments (Gill and Schultz, 2001). This section summarizes the described in NOAA Special Publication NOS CO-OPS 2 (CO-OPS, 2003), which are used in the U.S. for computing tidal datums. These were used because they are well documented. Procedures used elsewhere do not have the same level of documentation. Tidal datums are of importance because they are legal definitions of private, public, state, federal and international marine boundaries depend on the intersection of the ocean and the land at a specific phase of the tide (Gill and Schultz, 2001) ( Figure 11). The intersection of the ocean with the land is defined by tidal datums. An example of a marine boundary defined by a tidal datum is the Exclusive Economic Zone, which is 200 nm from the low-water datum MLLW (Gill and Schultz, 2001). Beyond this 200 nm boundary are international waters. MLLW is also the low-water datum used on nautical charts in the U.S. to reference the depth of the seafloor and submerged hazards (Gill and Schultz, 2001). MSL is another important tidal datum of particular importance because it is the surface to which geodesists attempt to approximate as close as possible with the Geoid (Torge, 2001).  Tidal datums are derived from water-level observations. In the U.S., there are three types of tide stations from which water-levels are observed. Primary tide stations are stations that have been installed and operating for at least 19 yrs. The 19-year period of time is used to define a primary station because it encompasses the sufficient amount of time over which the variations introduced from astronomic cycles are averaged out during the computation of tidal datums (Gill and Schultz, 2001). The 19-year period includes the regression of the lunar nodes, which is the longest observable cycle that contributes to variations in water-level heights. Specific 19-year periods of time are adopted by the NOS as National Tidal Datum Epochs (NTDE) (Gill and Schultz, 2001). NTDE defines the period of time over which water-level observations are used to obtain mean values for computing tidal datums (Gill and Schultz, 2001). The other two types of tide stations are secondary tide stations, which operate for more than 1-year and less than 19-yrs, and tertiary stations, which operate for less than 1-year (Gill and Schultz, 2001). Data from these stations are not sufficient for independently deriving tidal datums thus they are compared with simultaneous observations from a primary station. Then the data are mathematically reduced to an equivalent NTDE using the procedures described with semi-diurnal tides because DLQ tends to be very small for those areas (CO-OPS, 2003). Monthly means are reduced and corrected to a NTDE using the comparison of monthly means (CMM) method. The CMM method compares monthly means at the secondary station to simultaneous monthly means at a primary station. If the tidal record at the secondary station is shorter than a month or spans two partial months then the Tide-By-Tide (TBYT) method is used. The TBYT method compares simultaneous high and low water-levels between a secondary and a primary station instead of simultaneous monthly means (CO-OPS, 2003)."}, {"section_title": "Point-Source Vertical-Datum Separation Values", "text": "The separation between a reference ellipsoid, a smooth representation of the equipotential surface of the earth's gravity field that most closely coincides with mean sea level, and the CD, a reference surface derived from locally observed or predicted tidal behavior, varies spatially.

The LAT-to-WGS84 separations measured at shore-based tide stations are interpolated offshore based on MSQ tidal-zoning practices (Martin and Broadbent, 2004). The CHS carried out a GPS campaign in 1995 to determine the separation between CD and NAD83 for the Bay of Fundy (O'Reilly et. al., 1996). Separations measured at 21 tide stations around the bay were used to model the separation offshore (O'Reilly et. al., 1996). Several modeling techniques were used to develop a smooth separation surface of the bay. O 'Reilly et. al. (1996) determined that the Kriging and radial basis methods provided the most appropriate representations of the separation surface. The NOS is in the process of developing vertical datum transformation models for coastal areas around the U.S. as part of the VDATUM project (Hess et. al., 2003;Myers, 2005). A derivative of the VDATUM project is the VDATUM transformation tool. This tool transforms heights between tidal, orthometric and ellipsoidal datums used in the U.S. based on measured and separations between these datums that have been either measured or modeled (Hess et. al., 2003;Myers, 2005). The CD to reference ellipsoidal separation is obtained using a four step process with two datum transformations. The tidal to orthometric datum transformation is based on observed differences in MSL and the National Vertical Datum of 1988 at tidal benchmarks. These differences are spatially interpolated to regularly gridded points using a Kriging algorithm. The orthometric to ellipsoid transformation is accomplished using the National Geodetic Survey's GEOID99 model (Hess et. al., 2003;Myers, 2005)."}, {"section_title": "Examples of Previous GPS Buoy Projects", "text": "Many research projects have been conducted with the purpose of using a variety of different GPS buoys for measuring water-levels. The following paragraphs will describe several of the projects. The list of projects described is not exhaustive, but representative of the work that has been done and are similar to the research in this thesis. Research conducted by Stephen DeLoach (1996)  During this project the Coast Guard vessel was also used to accurately measure water-levels while the vessel was moving at a constant speed. Their results showed that water-level measurements obtained while the vessel was in motion could be used to measure changes in orthometric heights relative to a reference ellipsoid. They concluded that the GPS has the potential to measure the height of a ship above MLLW. Yang and Lo (2000) deployed a GPS buoy with Real-Time Kinematic position capabilities near the NOAA tide gauge at Eagle Point, TX. The deployment lasted nearly 11 hrs. The ellipsoid heights for the GPS antenna on the buoy were transferred to the water-level using a static offset. After converting the water-level measurements from the conventional tide gauge and the GPS buoy to MSL there was a mean bias of 1.3 cm between the two, with the measurements from the conventional gauge generally reading higher than the measurements from the GPS buoy. The standard deviation of the differences between the two water-level measurements was 9 mm. Chen et. al. (2004) investigated the use of improved satellite clock and orbit parameters provided by the International GNSS Service (IGS), formerly the International GPS Service, for kinematic GPS precise point positioning of sea levels. Chen et. al. (2004) were able to achieve decimeter level accuracy for water-level measurements using a GPS buoy. Wert et. al. (2004) used the satellite based GPS correction system C-Nav, which is developed by C & C Technologies. A C-Nav receiver and antenna were installed on the Canadian Coast Guard Ship Amundsen. This ship was iced in Franklin Bay, North West Territories over winter. The ship was used as a GPS buoy and GPS heights were used to retrieve tidal heights for the bay. Their results showed that they were able to detect tides in the Arctic to within the specification for IHO Special Order surveys (IHO, 1998).

All of the data were processed using NovAtel's GrafNav Batch version 7. UNB used an elevation cutoff angle of 5\u00b0 during GrafNav post-processing of the GPS data. This low cutoff angle was used because the loss of a position during kinematic applications is more detrimental then using signals with some tropospheric contamination (Wells, 2008b).  Two sets of single-baseline PPK solutions were provided by UNB as ASCII text files. One set of solutions is the GPS data collected on the ferry postprocessed with data from GPS base station CGSJ. The other set is the GPS data collected in the ferry post-processed with data from GPS base station DRHS. Table 8 shows the GrafNav parameters provided in each of the ASCII text files. Six parameters in Table 8 were used to characterize the water-level during a ferry crossing. The ellipsoid heights (H-EII) were used to estimate the water level height. The ellipsoid heights were time stamped using the GPS time (HMS) and Date parameters. The longitude and latitude of the solutions were used when the solutions were aggregated into spatial zones. The vertical uncertainties for the ellipsoid height (SDHeigh) were used to filter out heights with uncertainties larger than 15 cm. This 15 cm threshold is larger than the uncertainty level (10 cm) of kinematic surveying (Seeber, 2003). Table 9 shows the number of single-baseline solutions, the percentage of the solutions that had a vertical uncertainty less than 15 cm and percentage of those with a vertical uncertainty less than 10 cm.

The CGSJ base station was 1.8 km from the ferry terminal in Saint John, NB ( Figure 14). The DRHS base station was 4.4 km from the ferry terminal in Digby, NS ( Figure 15). While the ferry was moored to the terminals the errors in the GPS signals received by the GPS on the ferry are more strongly correlated with the GPS signals received by the nearest base station than the signals received by the base station farther away (Figure 25).  the ferry terminal in Saint John, NB were computed from more than 7200000 1sec single-baseline solutions. The average vertical uncertainties for the VTGZ at the ferry terminal in Digby, NS were computed from more than 5020000 1-sec single-baseline solutions. For the VTGZs between the two terminals the average vertical uncertainties were computed from less than 185000 1-sec single-baseline solutions. On average, solutions processed using data from CGSJ have a larger vertical uncertainty than solutions processed with data from DRHS. The average uncertainty for the solutions between 72 and 75 km from CGSJ or DRHS is less than 10 cm. The two sets of single-baseline solutions were combined using the GrafNav estimated vertical uncertainties. The expressions for combining the solutions are as follows: where: and: w -weighting factor <x = single-baseline GrafNav height uncertainty where:     Figure 26. During this time period the vertical uncertainty was relatively high, rarely improving to less than 10 cm. The black dashed-line marks the 15 cm vertical uncertainty threshold that was used in this research. The uncertainty of the long baseline solutions exceeded the 15 cm threshold more often than the short baseline solutions. Also, there were times when both solutions exceeded the 15 cm threshold. The most obvious times that this occurred was at the beginning of the day as the ferry was approaching the terminal and then 8.5 hours later while the ferry was moored to the dock. During the time that the long-baseline solutions diverge from the short-baseline solutions the maximum vertical uncertainty of the long baseline solutions is 30.7 cm, which is 21.6% of the difference in height between the long-baseline solutions and the CHS 324 water-level measurements. The vertical uncertainties of the shortbaseline solutions increase to 29.7 cm around the 9 th hour, which is larger than the difference between the short-baseline solutions and CHS 324 water-level measurements during that time. The GrafNav estimated vertical uncertainty is smaller than the differences between the long-baseline solutions and the CHS 324 water-level measurements that were observed around the 9 th hour of May 12 20  Some of the long-baseline solutions between the 3 rd and 4 th hour have vertical uncertainties that exceed the 15 cm vertical uncertainty threshold, thus the h mix solutions at those epochs are single-baseline solutions. The time period outlined between the 8 th and 9 th hours shows a time period when the vertical uncertainties for both the long-and short-baseline solutions exceeded the 15 cm threshold thus no solutions were available for analysis during that time."}, {"section_title": "Virtual Tide Gauge Zones (VTGZ)", "text": "One of the challenges of using a ferry as a moving GPS buoy is that the ferry rarely crosses the same location twice. Thus, in order to develop a time series of water-level estimates for a harmonic analysis, h mix solutions within spatial regions were aggregated together. These spatial regions are called Virtual Tide Gauge Zones (VTGZ). The area over which the ferry traveled while it was transiting between Saint John, NB and Digby, NS was divided into 62 VTGZ. VTGZ number 1 is at Saint John, NB and VTGZ number 62 is at Digby, NS. The coordinates for these zones are in the 'Virtual Tide Gauge Zone Coordinates' appendix.. All of the 62 VTGZs had an east/west width of 5km and a north/south width of 1.2 km. These widths were based on achieving an optimal balance between the spatial density and the variability of the data. A literature search showed that the recommended sampling period for estimating water-level heights in the US is at least 180 sec (CO-OPS, 2008). The width of the VTGZs was based on this sampling period. The maximum rate of change in the water-level height was used to estimate the uncertainty introduced by this sampling period. The frequency of the ferry's motions identified in a power spectrum of single-baseline PPK heights were used to verify that this averaging period was long enough to average out the ferry's roll, pitch and heave. Because of the 1 Hz logging rate of the GPS receivers and the north/south route of the ferry the spatial density of the data in the north/south direction was primarily controlled by the speed of the ferry. The speed of the ferry varies from crossing-to-crossing and from VTGZ-to-VTGZ. For example, the average speed of the ferry for all of the ferry crossings of VTGZ 15 and 35 are shown in Figure   30. In each of these histograms there are two peaks, one large peak at 7.5 m/s and another much smaller peak at 9.8 m/s. The reason for these two peaks is that under most conditions the ferry operates using two engines; however when the ferry is behind schedule and needs to travel faster the ferry operates using 4 engines. When the ferry was operating with 2 engines it took an average of 160 sec for the ferry to cross from one end of the VTGZ to the other. When the ferry was operating with 4 engines it took an average of 122 sec. Because the path of the ferry through a VTGZ also varies from crossing-to-crossing and VTGZ-to-VTGZ these 160 and 122 sec time spans are representative of direct straight-line crossings when the ferry was operating with 2 or 4 engines.  The spatial density of the data in the east/west direction was controlled by the weather conditions under which the ferry was capable of operating. Under good conditions the ferry takes the most direct path between the terminals at Saint John, NB and Digby, NS. However, when the sea-state increases and a large swell propagates out of the Atlantic Ocean and up the Bay of Fundy the ferry deviates from a direct path between the terminals and travels so its path has more of a perpendicular orientation to the swell (Figure 31). This is done to minimize the roll of the vessel, which provides a safer more enjoyable ride for the passengers, crew and cargo."}, {"section_title": "241", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "45\u00b0N Lower Bay of Fundy", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "New Brunswick", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Saint John", "text": "Nova Scotia The 5 km east/west width was used because it encompassed the spatial area along the ferry's route with the highest density of crossings. A larger width would have encompassed more ferry crossings, which are valuable from a timeseries analysis point of view because the ferry's crossing schedule provides a sparse record of the tide in each of the VTGZ. However, the width needs to be limited to allow the assumption that the water-surface in a VTGZ moves up and down as a horizontal surface without a slope.   The sample interval for the water-level measurements at CHS 140 is 1 hour. Based on the co-amplitude map and the maximum rates of change for the three tide stations it is apparent that there is spatial variability of the tidal characteristics in the bay. Thus, the larger a VTGZ is the more variability there will be within a zone. Assuming a maximum 3.5 cm/min rate of change along the co-amplitude line between Saint John, NB and Digby, NS, during a crossing of a VTGZ that takes 160 sec the water-level within the VTGZ will have changed 10 cm. 44 IrW If the size of the VTGZ is too small, then the estimated height of the water surface in that VTGZ could potentially be biased by the high-frequency motion of the ferry.

The peak-to-trough range of these cycles varies from 39 to 11 cm. The behavior of the PPK heights shown in Figure 35-b do not display the same cyclical pattern that appears in the heights as the ferry is crossing the bay. The period of the peak-to-peak cycles shown in Figure 35-a verify that the frequencies identified in the power spectrum ( Figure 33) are a result of motions induced by the roll, pitch and heave of the vessel as it crosses the bay. Because the average amount of time it takes the ferry to cross through the middle of the 1.25 km wide VTGZ is longer than the longer period motions of the ferry identified in the power spectrum, averaging the PPK heights during the crossings of the VTGZ will reduce the noise from the high-frequency motions of the vessel without biasing the averages."}, {"section_title": "12", "text": "Power spectrum of single-baseline PPK Heights   "}, {"section_title": "Water-Level Height Estimates and their Uncertainty", "text": "The water surface in each VTGZ during each crossing is characterized by a height and height uncertainty estimate.

Monthly means are surfaces defined by the range of the tide. The tides in the Bay of Fundy region are semi-diurnal, which requires each of the high and low water-levels in a day to be designated as the higher or lower water-level. For example a month with 30 days typically has 60 high and low water-levels, 2 high and 2 low water-levels a day. These high (low) water-levels are paired starting with the first set of high (low) water-levels in the month to give 30 pairs of high (low) water-levels. Then each individual high water-level in a pair of high waterlevels is designated as higher high-water (hhw) or lower high-water (Ihw). Similarly, the individual low water-level in a pair of low water-levels are designated as higher low-water (hlw) and lower low-water (llw). These designations then result in 4 categories of tide with each category containing 30 tide values (high or low water-levels). The tides in each category are reduced to mean hhw (mhhw), mean Ihw (mlhw), mean hlw (mhlw) and mean llw (mllw). The form of the reduction for the tides in each category is the same as the example given for mhhw where nw is the number of hhw in the month, which in the case of a 30 day month nw would typically equal 30. The variance of mhhw {cr 2 mhhw ) is where a 2 hhw is the variance of predicted hhw. This variance is based on the propagation of the uncertainty of the water-level estimate through the HAMWLS and is obtained directly from equation 17as are those for all the predicted high and low water-levels used to compute the monthly means.

Thus, there would be ~7200 observations for a 10-month record, which is the time span of the data from the Princess of Acadia GPS project that was used in this research (7 December 2003to 25 September 2004. Because it takes the Princess of Acadia ferry 3 hours to transit between Saint John, NB and Digby, NS and the ferry makes 1 to 3 round trip crossings a day, the period of time between crossings of a VTGZ not only exceeds the sample interval for a traditional water-level record but it varies from crossing-to-crossing. However, the ferry's route is along a co-amplitude line with similar tidal characteristics at each end. Thus, it is safe to assume that the tidal characteristics along the ferry's route are similar and a priori knowledge of the tidal constituents contributing to the tidal signals at Saint John, NB and Digby, NS are used as a priori knowledge to model the tides in each of the VTGZs. The non-uniform sampling interval of the water-level record in each VTGZ allows for tidal frequencies higher than the Nyquist frequency to be resolved (Scargle, 1982). In the 2008 specifications and deliverables for water-level stations the CO-OPS recommends that water-level measurements should be computed from an average of at least 180 one-second water-level measurements (CO-OPS, 2008). Because the ferry follows different paths at different speeds through each of the VTGZs each water-level estimate {h wl ) in each VTGZ is computed from a different number of h m ; x solutions. The water-level estimates in VTGZs 2 through 61 were computed differently than the water-level estimates in VTGZ 1 and 62. This is done because VTGZ 1 and 62 encompass the ferry terminals and to avoid averaging over long time spans (the ferry could be moored for anywhere between 1 to 24 hours depending on the ferry schedule), the averaging period in VTGZ 1 and 62 is held constant at 181 sec. Because the amount of time the ferry spent in a VTGZ varied from crossing-to-crossing minimum and maximum time constraints were established to restrict which crossings are used to characterize the height of the water-  and VTGZ 35 (Figure 36-d). These two distributions show that the ferry usually crosses these zones at an average speed of 7.5 m/s, however there is a group of crossings of each VTGZ at 9.8 m/s. The two different peaks in the distributions of the average crossing speed is a result of the ferry using 2 engines under most conditions, but when the ferry is behind schedule two more engines are engaged, increasing the maximum cruising speed. The time when the water-level was sampled in each VTGZ was controlled by the ferry crossing schedule. Consequently, the time series used in the harmonic analyses were not equally spaced. Figure 37 shows the distribution of sample intervals for the time series of water-level estimates in VTGZs 2 through 61. The average sample interval between water-level estimates (ferry crossings) in each VTGZ was 7.26 hrs +/-9.5 hrs (1 a). There are some samples that are separated by more than 4.5 days as a result of the ferry traveling outside the VTGZs (Figure 31). Sixty-five percent of the samples are separated by a period of time smaller than the Nyquist equal sampling interval for the M2 tide. The other 35% exceed the Nyquist sampling interval for M2.

This means that the magnitude of the uncertainty of an individual coefficient estimated through the least-squares procedure is independent of the number of tidal constituents used."}, {"section_title": "Coefficient uncertainties", "text": "Consequently, as the number of tidal constituents used to predict the water-level estimate increases the uncertainty in the least-squares prediction also increases."}, {"section_title": "Amplitude and Phase Computed using HAMWLS", "text": "The least-squares procedure used in this research was validated by comparing constituent amplitudes and the time of predicted high and low waterlevels to values published by the CHS. This section refers to two types of leastsquares procedures HAMELS and HAMWLS. There are two differences between the two procedures. One difference is that in the HAMWLS the waterlevel estimates are weighted by the inverse of water-level estimate uncertainty, whereas in the HAMELS they are weighed equally with unit weight. The second difference is that the covariance matrix for model coefficients, for which the errors in amplitude and phase are computed, is not computed using equation 14because there is no original uncertainty estimates. Instead, the covariance matrix for the coefficients (Q x ) is computed as where mse is the quotient of the sum of squares of the residuals and the degrees of freedom. Table 14 compares the amplitude and phase resulting from the HAMELS to the amplitude and phase for the Saint John, NB tide station determined by the CHS. The amplitude and phase resulting from the HAMELS differ from those reported by the CHS for two reasons. First, the CHS amplitudes and phases are corrected for the variations of their mean caused by the regression of the Moon's nodes (Pugh, 2004), whereas the amplitudes and phases from HAMELS are not corrected for nodal regression. Second, the CHS uses a phase epoch of Atlantic Standard Time, whereas the phase epoch for the solutions from HAMELS is the start time of the record used in the analysis. Consequently, inferences made from comparing amplitudes and phases between columns are limited. However, the percent difference between the amplitudes in the two columns gives insight to the accuracies of the amplitudes in the HAMELS column. Pugh (2004) reported that the amplitude variation due to nodal regression is 3.7% for M2, 11.5% for K1, and 28.6% for K2. The lunar declination constituents K1 and K2 have the largest amplitude changes (Pugh, 2004). The un-corrected amplitudes for M2, K1, and K2 in the HAMELS column are 1.0%, 8.2%, and 27.0% different from the corrected amplitudes in the CHS column. These percent differences are within the expected amplitude variation for these tide constituents. Because of the different epochs for the phases in the two different columns of Table 14, the times of the predicted high and low water-levels were used to assess the accuracy of the HAMELS predictions. Four months of high and low water-levels predicted using HAMELS were compared to highs and lows for the same 4 months predicted using the CHS model. The times of the two different sets of predicted high and low water-levels agree to within +/-9.6 min (1o). where x is the predictions from WebTide, y is the predictions from the HAMWLS, x(i) and y(i) denote the WebTide and HAMWLS prediction at time /', respectively.

Figure 41 compares the Geoid, an equipotential surface that approximates global mean sea level, to MSL computed for each VTGZ using the two different sets of HAMWLS predictions. The solid blue line in Figure 41 is the heights from the Natural Resources Canada Geoid-to-ellipsoid separation model GPS-Hv2.0. This software package transforms between orthometric CGVD28 and ellipsoidal (NAD83(CSRS) or ITRF97) heights using the Canadian Geoid model CGG2000 and a corrector surface. The corrector surface distorts the Geoid heights to fit the errors in the CGVD28 and ellipsoid heights (Veronneau, 2000). MSL profiles across the Bay of Fundy    Figure 43 -The h mix are shown in black and the distance the ferry was from base station CGSJ is shown in green. The reason for the two 'dips' identified in Figure 43 is shown in Figure 44, which shows the h m -, x solutions that are in Figure 43. Figure 44 also shows the speed of the ferry. Immediately one notices that the dips occur when the ferry is accelerating as it leaves the terminal at Saint John, NB and when the ferry is decelerating as it approaches the terminal at Digby, NS. It takes the ferry about 8 minutes to reach a speed 7.8 m/s then it takes 10 minutes for the h mix solutions to stabilize (i.e. the ferry has come out of the 'dip'). Ten minutes after the h mix solutions have stabilized the speed of the ferry is decreased to 7.2 m/s and remains at about that speed for the next 2 hours. When the speed of the ferry was reduced to 7.2 m/s after leaving the terminal at Saint John, NB it was 13 km offshore from the CGSJ base station. Two hours later when the speed of the ferry increased rapidly it was 65 km offshore from the CGSJ base station and 7 km from the terminal at Digby, NS.  Figure 44 also shows that while the ferry was moored to the dock at the Digby, NS terminal there was a lot of irregular noise in the h m j X solutions. For example, at 16:29 (UTC) the heights rapidly increased by 13 cm then 14 minutes later the heights rapidly decreased by 14 cm. Then again, 5 minutes later, the heights increased rapidly by 11 cm and 3 minutes later they decreased by 17 cm. The exact cause of these rapid height changes is not known but they are believed to be a combination of cargo being unloaded and loaded, and restrictions from the mooring lines holding the ferry to the dock. shows these events as a function of distance offshore from the GPS base station CGSJ. Figure 45 shows that the locations that the acceleration/deceleration events occur are the same locations that the larger differences between MSL and the Geoid occur. Thus, the larger differences between MSL and the Geoid that occur on both sides of the bay are a result of the h mix solutions being contaminated by the behavior of the ferry in those VTGZs, which in turn bias the HAMWLS of the water-level estimates in those VTGZs. Similar 'dips' to those identified in Figure 43 and Figure 44 occur on most of the crossings during the Princess of Acadia GPS Project, thus the differences shown by the blue curve in Figure 45 are representative of the 9 months of data. Based on Figure 45, the locations that acceleration and deceleration of the ferry has the largest apparent effect on the h mix solutions are from 0 to 13.61 km and from 64.38 to 72.25 km offshore from GPS base station CGSJ. The maximum difference between the Geoid and the two MSL profiles for the VTGZs that are not within those ranges is 2.5 cm ( Figure 42). The uncertainties estimated for the tidal datums in each profile from the water-level estimates uncertainties propagated through the least-squares procedure, the predictions, and the tidal datum computations are 1.2 cm and 0.9 cm for the freq-61 and freq-5 profiles."}, {"section_title": "Profiles of MLLW Computed from the Ferry Data", "text": "There are a limited number of sources to compare with the MLLW heights computed from the ferry data. This research used MLLW heights for Saint John, NB and Digby, NS computed from published tidal benchmark elevations, the height of MLLW above CD, and ITRF2000 Online Positioning User Service (OPUS) solutions. The OPUS solutions are based on static observations of tidal benchmark 99B9006 at tide station CHS 065 and TBM BOLLARD at tide station CHS 324 (Table 5). The transformation from CD to MLLW was necessary because the tidal datums computed in this research follow the NOAA Special Publication NOS CO-OPS 2 (CO-OPS, 2003), which does not define LLWLT. The height of MLLW above CD at Saint John, NB and Digby, NS was computed using the same methods as were used to compute MLLW from the predicted water-levels in all of the tide regions, although using conventional gauge data instead of predictions. Monthly means for March 2004 through August 2004 were computed for Saint John, NB (Table 16). Monthly means for May 2004 through August 2004 were computed for Digby, NS (Table 17). Data from these periods of time are used because they are the longest continuous records during the Princess of Acadia GPS Project for the respective stations. The monthly means for each station were corrected to the 1983 to 2003 NTDE using NOAA station 8410140 in Eastport, ME. The Eastport, ME monthly means used in the tidal datum computation for tide stations CHS 065 and CHS 324 are shown in Table 18. Table 19 shows the corrected tidal datums for tide stations CHS 065 and CHS 324 in columns 2 and 3, respectively. Column 3 contains the accepted 1983 to 2001 NTDE tidal datums for Eastport, ME that were used to compute the tidal datums for tide stations CHS 065 and CHS 324. The difference in the definition of CD used at the CHS and NOAA stations shown in Table 19 is caused by the fact that the height of MLLW above chart datum at NOAA 8410140 is zero whereas the height of MLLW above CD at CHS 065 and CHS 324 is 1.10 m and 1.14 m, respectively. Saint John, NB (CHS 065) monthly means  The average difference between Gt used to compute the two profiles was 17 cm. The average difference between the freq-61 and freq-5 MLLW profiles was 8 cm, which is approximately half of the average difference for Gt. Figure 46 also shows the height of MLLW above ITRF2000 at the Saint John, NB and Digby, NS ferry terminals computed from the OPUS solutions and the height of MLLW above CD. The error bars for the MLLW heights at Saint John, NB and Digby, NS have a length equal to 2 times the peak-to-peak vertical accuracy reported by OPUS. The uncertainties estimated for the tidal datums in each profile from the propagation of the original water-level estimates uncertainties through the leastsquares procedure, the predictions, and the tidal-datum computations are 3.3 cm and 3.1 cm for the freq-61 and freq-5 profiles.

The validity of these results is confirmed by the close match of the extracted MSL to the local Geoid that was established through independent means. In this work two challenges became immediately apparent: The first is due to the use of a ferry as the measurement platform which results in a non-uniform sampling interval for discrete VTGZs and that the intervals are relatively large. The second challenge is to use a dataset that lacks vessel roll, pitch, heave and draft measurements for correcting changes in the measured water-level, resulting from the GPS antenna not being at the roll/pitch center of the ferry. The magnitude of theses changes due to roll, pitch and heave are shown in the 'Virtual Tide Gauge Zone' section to reach more than 1 m. The magnitude of these changes due to constraints from the mooring lines holding the ferry to the dock, loading and unloading while the ferry was moored to the terminals was shown in to be on the order of 15 cm for an individual docking event. The method that was developed to overcome the first challenge is composed of 5 primary steps. The first step consists of dividing a portion of the region over which the ferry travels into discrete VTGZs. The second step consists of compiling water-level records for each VTGZ. These water-level records consist of estimates of the height of the water-level in the VTGZ. These estimates are computed by averaging all the h mix solutions in a VTGZ during a ferry crossing. The uncertainty in the estimated water-level height is estimated by the sum of the squares of the residuals between the h mix solutions and the average computed from them. The third step employs a priori knowledge of the significant constituents at shore-based tide stations. This knowledge is used in a least-squares procedure to define coefficients for the model in equation 1that are unique to each VTGZ. The fourth step consists of using these model coefficients to predict 8 months of high and low water-levels. The fifth step employs the techniques in the NOAA Special Publications NOS CO-OPS 2 (CO-OPS, 2003) to compute tidal datums in each VTGZ from the predicted high and low water-levels (see the 'Processing Flow Chart' section). The 'Least Squares Fit to Water-Level Estimates' section shows that the results from modeling the non-uniform water-level estimates with 61 constituents agree to within +/-17.2 cm (1<x) of the water-level estimates. When only 5 constituents are used the standard deviation of the differences between the water-level estimates and the least-squares predictions increases to 30.2 cm. The 'Profiles of MSL Computed from the Ferry Data' section shows that the propagation of the original uncertainty estimates through the least-squares procedure, the predictions, and the tidal-datum computation results in uncertainty estimates between 0.9 and 1.2 cm for MSL when using 5 and 61 tidal constituents, respectively. The 'Profiles of MLLW Computed from the Ferry Data' section shows that for the MLLW tidal datums the original uncertainty estimates resulted in datum uncertainties of 3.1 to 3.3 cm when using 5 and 61 tidal constituents, respectively. The uncertainty in the MSL and MLLW tidal datums estimated using the original uncertainty estimates are at least 10 times smaller than the difference between the water-level estimates and the least-squares predictions, which ranged from -86.2 to 76.3 cm when using 61 tidal constituents and from -110.1 to 107.3 cm when using 5 tidal constituents. The section with the MSL profiles and the section with the MLLW profiles also show that propagation of the original uncertainties results in less uncertainty in the tidal datums computed from the model using 5 constituents than the tidal datums computed from the model using 61 constituents. Based on the results in the 'Profiles of MLLW Computed from the Ferry Data' section, the uncertainties in the tidal datums computed for each VTGZ are underestimated by the propagation of the original uncertainty estimates. Therefore, a more appropriate estimate of uncertainty is the standard deviation of the residuals between the water-level estimates and the predictions. the Geoid-to-ellipsoid separations to within 2.2 cm and 2.5 cm when using 61 constituents and 5 constituents, respectively. The uncertainty in the Geoid model used to compute the Htv2.0 heights is between 3 and 6 cm for the Bay of Fundy region (Veronneau, 2000). Also, uncertainties in the MSL heights computed in this research are estimated to be 17.2 cm for profiles computed using 61 constituents and 30.2 cm for the profiles computed using 5 constituents. Thus, the difference between the MSL-to-ellipsoid separations and the Geoid-toellipsoid are not significant. The significant result is that the MSL-to-ellipsoid separations computed from the non-uniform times series closely follow the same trend as the Geoid-to-ellipsoid separations. Although the MSL profiles show that MSL computed from water-levels predicted using 5 and 61 tidal constituents differ from the Geoid-to-ellipsoid separation by no more than 2.5 cm, the MLLW profiles shows that MLLW is underestimated when 5 tidal constituents are used. The trend of the two MLLW profiles is similar, however at 8 km offshore from the Digby, NS terminal the height of MLLW computed from water-level predictions based on 5 tidal constituents is -26.26 m above ITRF2000, which is 2.3 cm higher than MLLW computed for TBM BOLLARD at the Digby, NS ferry terminal. The height of MLLW 8 km offshore from the Digby, NS terminal computed from water-level predictions based on 61 tidal constituents is -26.34 m above ITRF2000, which is 5.7 cm lower than MLLW computed for TBM BOLLARD. In conclusion, this research shows that by employing a priori knowledge during the harmonic analysis useful information can be extracted from a nonuniform times series. This research also shows that applying these techniques to the Princess of Acadia GPS Project dataset MSL and MLLW can be computed to within +/-17.2 cm at the 1cr level using water-levels predicted from a model with 61 constituents."}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Future Work", "text": "The future recommendations fall into three categories. One is a group of suggestions for improving the accuracy of water-level measurements made using a ferry. The second category suggests a validation of the method developed in this research. The third category involves two suggestions for alternative methods of estimating the uncertainty in the model coefficients obtained from the least-squares procedure. Category 1 -To get the full potential out of water-level measurements from a ferry settlement and squat should be modeled using a controlled experiment. Also, accurate measurements of the ferry's rotation around its center of gravity (roll and pitch) should be made to improve the results when the ferry is maneuvering. Similarly, measurements should be made to correct for the changes in draft introduced by the loading and unloading of ferry cargo. Category 2 -It is recommended that offshore MLLW heights computed using the method developed in this research be validated by deploying one or more GPS buoys along the Princess of Acadia route. The buoys should be strategically deployed in one of the VTGZs used during this research that resulted in unbiased tidal datums. Tidal datums should be computed using the water-level heights observed by the GPS buoy and from predictions based on the water-level measurements. Category 3 -The final recommendation is to develop a more robust method, such as a Monte Carlo (Brennan, 2005) or bootstrapping (Pawlowicz, 2002)  A Zoftset is computed for every epoch that the ferry was docked at the ferry terminals and there were simultaneous PPK and conventional tide-gauge waterlevel measurements.
