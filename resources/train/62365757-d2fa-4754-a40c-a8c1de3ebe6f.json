NTPS collects data on core topics including teacher and principal preparation, classes taught, school characteristics, and demographics of the teacher and principal labor forces. It is developed by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) of the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) within the U.S. Department of Education and conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. This report presents selected findings from the Public and Private School Data Files of the 2017-18 NTPS, representing results of the second collection of NTPS. The purpose of NTPS is to collect information that can provide a detailed picture of U.S. elementary and secondary schools and their staff. This information is collected through school, principal, and teacher surveys. Information can be linked across all three surveys. The 2017-18 NTPS uses a school-based sample of public and private schools. All principals associated with the sampled public and private schools were also included in the sample. Teachers associated with a selected school were sampled from a list of teachers that was provided by the school, collected from school websites, or purchased from a vendor. The selected samples include about 10,600 traditional and charter public schools and their principals, 60,000 public school teachers, 4,000 private schools and their principals, and 9,600 private school teachers. The samples for public schools and staff were drawn to support estimates by geography, grade span, and charter status for public schools; the samples for private schools were drawn to support estimates by geography, grade span, and affiliation group for a wide range of topics. The reader is referred to the Survey Documentation for the 2017-18 National Teacher and Principal Survey (Cox et al. forthcoming) for details about these estimation domains and their precision criteria. The data were collected via mailed questionnaires and internet instruments with telephone and in-person field follow-up. Data collection began in September 2017, when the first questionnaires were mailed, and data collection ended in August 2018. The weighted unit response rate was 72.5 percent for public schools and 64.5 percent for private schools. For detailed information about response rates, bias analysis results, methodology, and design of the 2017-18 NTPS, please see the technical notes of this report in appendix B or the Survey Documentation for the 2017-18 National Teacher and Principal Survey (Cox et al. forthcoming). The purpose of this First Look report is to introduce new data through the presentation of tables containing descriptive information. Selected findings chosen for this report demonstrate the range of information available on the 2017-18 NTPS Public and Private School Restricted-Use Data Files. The selected findings do not represent a complete review of all observed differences in the data and are not meant to emphasize any issue. This First Look report highlights findings from the NTPS public and private school surveys. Findings from the principal and teacher surveys will be presented in two companion First Look reports: \u2022 Characteristics of Public andPrivate Elementary andSecondary School Principals in the United States: Results From the 2017-18 National Teacher andPrincipal Survey First Look (NCES 2019-141); and \u2022 Characteristics of Public andPrivate Elementary andSecondary School Teachers in the United States: Results From the 2017-18 National Teacher andPrincipal Survey First Look (NCES 2019-142). The tables in this report contain frequencies and percentages demonstrating bivariate relationships. All results have been weighted to reflect the sample design and to account for nonresponse and other adjustments. Comparisons drawn in the selected findings have been tested for statistical significance at the .05 level using Student's t statistics to ensure that the differences are larger than those that might be expected due to sampling variation. Although the selected findings include only statistically significant findings, they do not include every statistically significant comparison. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. Many of the variables examined are related to one another, and complex interactions and relationships have not been explored. Statistical Analysis Software (SAS 9.4) and SUDAAN (11.1) were used to compute the statistics for this report. Tables of standard errors are provided in appendix A. Detailed information about the survey methodology is provided in appendix B. Appendix C contains a description of the variables used in this report.

Public schools reported that 13 percent of K-12 students had an IEP. Among private schools, 59 percent reported having at least one student with a formally identified disability. Private schools reported that 8 percent of K-12 students had a formally identified disability (table 2). \u2022 Nationwide, about 21 percent of public schools and 13 percent of private schools offered any courses entirely online. Among public schools, a higher percentage of charter schools (30 percent) offered any courses entirely online, compared to traditional public schools (20 percent) (table 3). \u2022 Overall, 57 percent of public schools and 37 percent of private school offered instruction beyond the normal school day for students who need academic assistance. Additionally, 39 percent of public schools and 31 percent of private schools offered instruction beyond the normal school day for students who seek academic advancement or enrichment. Among public schools, more charter schools offered instruction beyond the normal school day for students who sought assistance (65 percent) or enrichment (50 percent), compared to traditional public schools (56 percent and 38 percent, respectively) (table 4). \u2022 Among public schools, primary schools (8:15 a.m.) had a later average start time than middle (8:05 a.m.), combined (8:05 a.m.), and high (8:03 a.m.) schools. A higher percentage of public high schools (10 percent) had start times before 7:30 a.m. when compared to middle (6 percent), combined (3 percent), and primary (2 percent) schools. Private schools had an average start time of 8:12 a.m., and 1 percent of private schools reported start times before 7:30 a.m. (table 5). \u2022 Among public schools in the United States, about 88 percent reported they were regular schools, 6 percent reported they were alternative or other types of schools, 4 4 percent reported they were special program emphasis, 5 1 percent reported they were special education, 6 and 1 percent reported they were career/technical/vocational schools. 7 Among private schools about 79 percent reported they were regular schools, 7 percent reported they were special education, 6 percent reported they were Montessori, 4 percent reported they were special program emphasis, 3 percent reported they were early childhood program or day care centers, 8 and 1 percent reported they were alternative or other types of schools (table 6). \u2022 Nationally, schools with a third grade reported a weekly average of 500 minutes of instruction in English, reading, and language arts; 350 minutes of instruction in arithmetic or mathematics; 170 minutes of instruction in science; and 170 minutes of instruction in social studies or history. Public schools with a third grade reported a weekly average of 540 minutes of instruction per week in English, reading, and language arts; 370 minutes in arithmetic or mathematics; 170 minutes in science; and 160 minutes in social studies or history. Private schools with a third grade reported a weekly average of 400 minutes per week in English, reading, and language arts; 280 minutes in arithmetic or mathematics; 170 minutes in science; and 170 minutes in social studies or history (table 7). \u2022 Among public schools with students enrolled in any grades 9-12, 82 percent offered dual or concurrent enrollment, 9 37 percent offered a specialized career academy, 10 74 percent offered career and technical education courses, 11 56 percent offered internships outside of school, 12 and 39 percent had block scheduling. 13 A higher percentage of traditional public schools offered dual or concurrent enrollment (83 percent), a specialized career academy (39 percent), career and technical education courses 77 percent), and internships outside of school (58 percent) when compared to charter schools (77 percent, 22 percent, 53 percent, and 44 percent, respectively). Among private schools with any of grades 9-12, 56 percent offered dual or concurrent enrollment, 6 percent offered a specialized career academy, 23 percent offered career and technical education courses, 20 percent offered internships outside of school, and 30 percent had block scheduling (table 8). Dual or concurrent enrollment offers both high school and college credit. A specialized career academy is a program that offers a set of specialized curriculum organized around a specific career area, such as automotive, business, carpentry, communications, construction, cosmetology, culinary arts, education, electricity, engineering, health, hospitality, IT, manufacturing, plumbing, protective and legal services, repair, transportation, etc. These courses are offered at the school but not as part of a specialized career academy. This includes work-based learning or internship outside of school, in which students earn course credits for supervised learning activities that occur in paid or unpaid workplace assignments. Block scheduling is when schools utilize extended class periods scheduled to create blocks of instruction time. Estimate Tables  Table 1.

To calculate the percentage of students approved for free or reduced-price lunches in this table, a count of students approved for free or reduced-price lunches was estimated by multiplying the proportion of approved students (S0427/100) by the K-12 enrollment of the school (ENRK12UG). The weighted sum of students approved for free and reduced-price lunches was then divided by the weighted sum of K-12 enrollment to obtain an overall percentage of students approved for free and reducedprice lunches. 4 Schools that did not participate in the federal free or reduced-price lunch program were considered to have zero students approved for the federal free or reduced-price lunch program.

NTPS is a state and nationally representative sample survey of public and private K-12 schools, principals, and teachers in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The NTPS was first conducted during the 2015-16 school year, and 2017-18 is the second NTPS collection. The 2017-18 NTPS consisted of questionnaires for six types of respondents: public schools, private schools, public school principals, private school principals, public school teachers, and private schools teachers. The information can be linked across teachers, principals, and schools by each sector (public and private). There is a separate data file for each type of respondent by sector (public school, private school, public school principal, private school principal, public school teacher, and private school teacher). For the content of the questionnaires, see https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/ntps/question1718.asp. NTPS was designed to produce national, regional, and state estimates for public elementary and secondary schools, principals, and teachers, including public charter schools and the principals and teachers within them. For private schools, the sample supports national, regional, and affiliation strata estimates for schools, principals, and teachers. Comparisons between public and private schools and their principals and teachers are possible only at the regional and national levels, because private schools were selected for sampling by affiliation strata and region rather than state. Additionally, the teacher survey was designed to produce national estimates of teachers by subject matter taught and by full-time or parttime status. For additional information on the specific NTPS-related topics discussed in this appendix, consult the Survey Documentation for the 2017-18 National Teacher and Principal Survey (Cox et al. forthcoming) or the User's Manual for the 2017-18 National Teacher andPrincipal Survey, Volumes 1-4 (Goldring et al. 2019). To access additional general information on NTPS or for electronic copies of the questionnaires, go to the NTPS home page (https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/ntps)."}, {"section_title": "Sampling Frames and Sample Selection", "text": "Public schools: The starting point for the 2017-18 NTPS public school sampling frame was the 2014-15 Common Core of Data (CCD) Nonfiscal School Universe data file. 1 The sampling frame was adjusted from the CCD to fit the definition of a school eligible for NTPS. To be eligible for NTPS, a school was defined as an institution or part of an institution that provides instruction to students, has one or more teachers to provide instruction, serves students in one or more of grades 1-12 or the ungraded equivalent, and is located in one or more buildings apart from a private home. It was possible for two or more schools to share the same building; in that case, they were treated as different schools if they had different administrators (i.e., principal or school head). This definition is unchanged from the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS). The 2017-18 NTPS universe of schools is confined to the 50 states plus the District of Columbia and excludes the other jurisdictions, Department of Defense overseas schools, and CCD schools that do not offer teacher-provided classroom instruction in grades 1-12 or the ungraded equivalent. This last group includes schools that are essentially administrative units that may oversee entities that provide classroom instruction or may only provide funding and oversight. Although Bureau of Indian Education-funded B-3 (BIE) schools are eligible for NTPS, these schools were not oversampled and the data do not support separate BIE estimates. The NTPS definition of a school is generally similar to the CCD definition, with some exceptions. NTPS allows schools to define themselves. In past NCES data collections, Census Bureau staff observed that in situations where two or more schools have the same administration, these schools were reported separately on CCD but generally reported as one entity for sample surveys. Thus, CCD schools with the same location, address, and phone number were collapsed during the frame building on the assumption that the respondent would consider them to be one school. A set of rules was applied to determine in which instances school records should be collapsed together. When school records were collapsed together, the student and teacher counts, grade ranges, and names as reported to CCD were all modified to reflect the change. Finally, since CCD and NTPS differ in scope and their definition of a school, some records were deleted, added, or modified to provide better coverage and a more efficient sample design for NTPS. For a detailed list of frame modifications, see the Survey Documentation for the 2017-18 National Teacher and Principal Survey (Cox et al. forthcoming). After deleting, collapsing, and adding school records, the 2017-18 NTPS public school sampling frame consisted of about 86,800 traditional public schools and 6,800 public charter schools. NTPS uses a systematic, probability proportionate to size (PPS) sample, where size is defined to be the square root of the number of full-time-equivalent (FTE) teachers in the school (for an explanation of PPS sampling, see Cochran 1977). Schools were oversampled based on the following characteristics: \u2022 School grade level (primary, middle, high, combined); \u2022 State; \u2022 Poverty status (low, high); \u2022 Enrollment (less than 100, 100-200, 200-500, 500-750, 750-1000, and more than 1,000); \u2022 Collapsed urbanicity (city, suburban, town, rural); and \u2022 Charter status. In addition to oversampling based on specific school characteristics, sample sizes were inflated for schools in 29 states with smaller numbers of schools, in order to ensure that all state-level estimates would meet the criteria for publishability. Prior to sampling, schools were sorted by the following: \u2022 smaller states (those with large standard errors within each region); \u2022 charter status; \u2022 combined grade status; \u2022 small school status; \u2022 school grade level (four levels); \u2022 urbanicity (four levels); \u2022 poverty status (four levels); \u2022 school size category (six levels); \u2022 state; and \u2022 the number of FTE teachers. These sampling procedures resulted in a total public school sample of about 9,180 traditional public schools and 1,400 public charter schools."}, {"section_title": "Data Collection Procedures", "text": "In 2017-18, NTPS employed a combined mail-based and internet survey approach, with subsequent telephone and in-person follow-up. Data collection included the Teacher Listing Form (TLF), the Principal Questionnaire, the School Questionnaire, and the Teacher Questionnaire. This report focuses on the School Questionnaire. In preparation for school-level data collection, advance letters were mailed to the sampled schools in July 2017 to verify their addresses. Initial school packages were mailed in September 2017. 2 Next, schools were telephoned to verify school information, establish a survey coordinator, and follow up on the Teacher Listing Form if the school had not already provided an electronic teacher list. The in-person follow-up period was preceded by phone calls from the telephone centers to remind the survey coordinators to have staff complete and return all forms. Data collection ended in August 2018. One of the main goals of the data collection plan for the 2017-18 NTPS was to target the schools that presented a challenge to data collection during previous administrations of SASS and NTPS. During the sampling stage, certain types of schools with historically low response rates were identified as well as schools with a potentially large impact on weighting. These schools were then placed on a priority track for data collection with additional strategies to improve response. Contact strategies that were more proactive were employed during the early phases of data collection of the 2017-18 NTPS to mitigate potential low response rates for these cases, such as in-person visits by Census field representatives. The data collection procedures also used survey coordinators to improve response. The role of the survey coordinator was to be the primary contact person at the school. A survey coordinator's duties included facilitating data collection by passing out questionnaires to the appropriate staff, reminding the staff to complete their questionnaires, and collecting the questionnaires to return. The data collection follow-up strategies for schools with a survey coordinator were different from schools without a survey coordinator, with more proactive approaches taken for those schools without a survey coordinator. The web was the primary mode of data collection for all questionnaire types for the 2017-18 NTPS. Paper questionnaires were introduced in later mailings, with some exceptions for the TLF."}, {"section_title": "Data Processing and Imputation", "text": "The Census Bureau checked returned questionnaires, keyed the data, and implemented quality control procedures. Questionnaires that had a preliminary classification of a complete interview were submitted to a series of computer edits consisting of a range check, a consistency edit, 3 a blanking edit, 4 and a logic edit. 5 After these edits were implemented and reviewed by analysts, the records were put through another edit to make a final determination as to whether the case was eligible for the survey and whether sufficient data had been collected for the case to be classified as a complete interview."}, {"section_title": "B-6", "text": "After the final edits were run, cases with \"not-answered\" values for items remained. Values were imputed for these cases using two main approaches. First, donor respondent methods, such as hot-deck imputation, were used. Second, if no suitable donor case could be matched, the few remaining items were imputed using mean or mode from groups of similar cases to impute a value to the item with missing data. After each stage of imputation, data checks were used to verify that the imputed data were consistent with the existing questionnaire data. If the imputed data were inconsistent with the existing questionnaire data, the imputed value was removed by one of these computer edits due to inconsistency with other data within the same questionnaire or because it was out of the range of acceptable values. In these situations, Census Bureau analysts looked at the items and tried to determine an appropriate value. Edit and imputation flags, indicating which edit or imputation method was used, were assigned to each relevant survey variable. For further information, see the sections on data processing and imputation in the Survey Documentation for the 2017-18 National Teacher and Principal Survey (Cox et al. forthcoming). Weighting adjustments were designed to reduce or eliminate nonresponse bias and to reduce the variance introduced due to sampling by adjusting the sample estimates to known totals from the frame. The finalweighted comparisons to eligible cases shown in tables B-1 and B-2 reflect the effect of weighting adjustment. Table B-1 shows that weighting adjustments eliminated most but not all evidence of potential bias for public schools, while Table B-2 shows that the weighting adjustments for private schools were successful in eliminating all evidence of potential bias in the categories included in the analysis. For public schools, evidence of potential bias remains after weighting adjustments for the following national-level items included in the analysis: \u2022 Percent non-White students, for schools with 30percent to less than 50percent non-White students; \u2022 Percent of students eligible free or reduced-price lunch, for schools where less than 35 percent of students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches; \u2022 Region, for schools in the South and West regions; \u2022 Title I status, for schools that have a Title I program; and \u2022 State, for schools in Alaska, California, Florida, Hawaii, Maryland, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas, and Utah. For private schools, no evidence of potential bias remains after weighting adjustments for any nationallevel items included in the analysis. For public schools, a limited set of characteristics (community type and grade level) were also examined for potential nonresponse bias at the state level. Before weighting adjustments, 72 out of the 408 state by characteristic cells showed a significant difference in response rate; after weighting adjustments, this was B-10 reduced to only 55 cells. The following states had multiple significant differences in community type and/or grade level domains after weighting adjustments, which is evidence of potential bias at the state level: Alaska, Arkansas, California, Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. For private schools, a limited set of characteristics (region and grade level) were also examined for potential nonresponse bias at the affiliation level. Before weighting adjustments, 4 out of the 21 affiliation by characteristic cells showed a significant difference in response rate; after weighting adjustments, this was reduced to only one cell. There were no affiliations with multiple significant differences in region and/or grade level domains after weighting adjustments.

Item response rates. The item response rate indicates the percentage of respondents who answered a given survey question or item. The weighted NTPS item response rate is calculated by dividing the weighted number of respondents who provided an answer to an item by the weighted number of respondents who were eligible to answer that item. 8 Table B-3 provides a summary of the weighted item response rates. For the public school data, four of the survey items included in this report have item response rates less than 85 percent. Those items were (1) percentage of prekindergarten students approved for free or reduced-price lunches (question 5-6b, item 1); (2) percentage of grades K-12 students approved for free or reduced-price lunches (question 5-6c); (3) number of students whose National School Lunch Program eligibility was determined through direct certification (question Q5-6d); and (4) number of K--12 students who participate in the Title I program (question 5-8b). For the private school data, four of the survey items included in this report have item response rates less than 85 percent. Those items were (1) minutes per day on science by third graders (question 2-3d); (2) days per week on science by third graders (question 2-3d); (3) minutes per day on science by eighth graders (question 2-6d); and (4) number of prekindergarten students participating in Title I (question 5-8a).

"}, {"section_title": "Weighting", "text": "The general purpose of weighting is to scale up the sample estimates to represent the target survey population. For NTPS, a base weight is used as the starting point. In most cases, this base weight is the simple reciprocal of the unit's probability of selection on the frame (the initial base weight), and in other B-11 cases, adjustments are made to this frame base weight to reflect multiple chances of selection from the frame or other situations such as subsampling. Next, a series of nonresponse adjustment factors are calculated and applied based on a weighting cell adjustment. Weighting cells are developed using tree search algorithms. These cells are selected to be homogeneous in response propensity within cells and heterogeneous in response propensity across cells (response propensity is the underlying chance that a particular sample unit will respond by completing the questionnaire: its individual response rate). The adjustment is the inverse of the weighted response rate within each cell, and each respondent in the cell receives this adjustment. Nonrespondents are given weights of zero and the respondents are reweighted to represent the nonrespondents. The variables examined for potential bias overlap substantially with those used by the tree search algorithms and include all subgroups that showed potential bias. For public schools, the variables used were enrollment, percent of enrollment with race other than White, percent free or reduced-price lunch eligible, community type, region, number of teachers, state, and special district flag; all but special district flag were also used in the bias analysis. For private schools, the variables used were affiliation, enrollment, community type, region, and number of teachers; all were also used in the bias analysis. These variables may show differential response conditional on other subgroups (i.e., they may be chosen as cell generators by the tree search algorithm within particular branches). Finally, for the school file, a raking factor is calculated and applied to the sample to adjust the sample totals to the frame totals, so that the sum of the weights within each of the specified cells is equal to the corresponding frame total for the cell. These cells are defined based on school level, urbanicity, and percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch for public schools; and on school level, affiliation, and urbanicity for private schools. The weights are then adjusted to the control totals by an iterative process, referred to as raking, until the weights simultaneously aggregate to be equal to each set of control totals. In some cases, extreme weights may be trimmed back to a cutoff value. This all improves the precision of survey estimates. The product of these factors is the final weight for each NTPS respondent, which appears as SFNLWGT on the NTPS Public and Private School Data Files."}, {"section_title": "Variance Estimation", "text": "In surveys with complex sample designs, such as NTPS, direct estimates of sampling errors that assume a simple random sample typically underestimate the variability in the estimates. The NTPS sample design and estimation include procedures that deviate from the assumption of simple random sampling, such as sampling with differential probabilities. NTPS uses jackknife replication to calculate appropriate sampling errors that account for the complex sample design. Jackknife replication methods involve dropping a small portion of the sample from the full sample and computing the statistic of interest for the retained and reweighted sample (the jackknife replicate). The sum of squares of the replicate estimates around the full sample estimate provides an estimate of the variance of the statistic. The NTPS school data file includes a set of 200 replicate weights designed to produce variance estimates. The set of replicate weights for each file should be applied to the respondents in that file. The replicate weights for NTPS respondents are SREPWT1-SREPWT200 for schools."}]
