[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with a genome size of 29,903 nucleotides in length. The 5\u2032 terminus of the SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes a polyprotein (pp1ab), which is further cleaved into 15 nonstructural proteins (nsp-1 to nsp-10 and nsp-12 to nsp-16), whereas the 3\u2032 terminus encodes four structural proteins (spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid) and eight accessory proteins (3a, 3b, p6, 7a, 7b, 8b, 9b, and ORF14) [1, 2] . The virus is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-diseases and have pandemic potential. SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for infection with special reference to the involvement of both the lower and upper respiratory tract [5, 7] . Furthermore, the potential for close contact between bats, civets, and humans in the wildlife trade in southern China, coupled with a possible propensity of these bats to foster CoV host-shifts, could explain SARS-like CoVs as the source of SARS-CoV [8] .\nTo accommodate the wide spectrum of clinical presentations and outcomes of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 [9] , the WHO recently introduced the name COVID-19 (World Health Organization, 2020) to denote this disease. The acronym COVID-19 stands for \"CO -corona,\" \"VIviruses,\" \"D -disease,\" and \"19 -the year 2019\" [10] . Despite the fact that COVID-19 has a death rate of 3.27% as of September, 27,236,916 confirmed cases with 891,031 confirmed deaths in a few months (December 8, 2019, to September 08, 2020) across 216 countries or territories are terrifying. Indeed, this virus is highly contagious, and the number of infected people can be doubled in less than seven days with a basic reproductive number (R0) of 2.2-2.7 [11] . In humans, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are rapidly spread by respiratory droplets, airborne routes, or direct contact [12] .\nThe viral genome encodes 29 proteins (Nature doi:10 .1038/s41433-020-0790-7). The functions of a large number of SARS-CoV-2 ORFs are poorly understood or unknown. The accessory proteins are unique to SARS-CoV, as they have little homology in amino acid sequences with accessory proteins of other coronaviruses [13] . An accessory ORF14 was first described in SARS-CoV by Marra et al. [14, 15] . Understanding the complete proteome of SARS-CoV-2, including the accessory proteins, is the need of the hour for the final destination of drug/medicine. Although the complete genome of SARS-CoV-2 has been made available in the public domain databases, it has been observed in our previous study on SARS-CoV-2 proteome analysis [2] that the two \"accessory\" ORFs ORF13 (9b) and ORF14 are poorly studied in SARS-CoV-2, as both are not annotated in most of the completed genome sequences [2] . Given the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to bat SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses, it is likely that bats serve as reservoir hosts for its progenitor. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein optimized for binding to human-like ACE2 is the result of natural selection [16] . Therefore, the present study reports the in silico sequence analysis, structure prediction, and evolutionary analysis of two such accessory proteins, 9b and ORF14, of the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": "2.1.

To verify the reliability of protein phylogeny (9b and ORF proteins), a whole-genome ML phylogenetic tree was constructed using the General Time Reversible model with Gamma distribution (G)."}, {"section_title": "Results and Discussion", "text": "3.1. Tertiary Structures of 9b and ORF14. The 9b protein (P0DTD2) with molecular weight = 10796:10 Daltons is rich in leucine (12.37%) and valine (10.31%) ( Figure 2 ). The ORF14 (P0DTD3) molecular weight = 8049:27 Daltons is rich in leucine (20.55%) and alanine (12.33%) ( Figure 3 ). ProMotif analysis of the final predicted structure of 9b, modeled using comparative modeling, calculated 2 sheets, 2 beta hairpins, 7 strands, 4 helices, 9 beta turns, and 1 gamma turn (Table 1 ; Figures 4 and 5; Figure S1 ). ProMotif analysis of the predicted ab initio structure of ORF14 calculated 5 helices, 9 helix-helix interacts, and 2 beta turns ( Figure S2 ). The verified structures of the ORF9b and ORF14 proteins had qmean4 z scores of -1.64 (Global Score : 0:67 \u00b1 0:09) and -1.18 (Global Score : 0:52 \u00b1 0:11), respectively (Annexures 1 & 2). Precheck verification showed 94.0% and 95.5% residues in the most favored regions (A, B, L) of Ramachandran plot in 9b and ORF14 proteins, respectively. Structural verification in ERRAT revealed good quality of the models with quality factors of 97.56 and 100 for ORF9b and ORF14 proteins, respectively. The verification reports indicate the high reliability of the theoretical structures ( Figures S3-S6) . The estimated high throughput tunnel-1 (blue) in the 9b protein is a bottleneck radius of 1.9 \u00c5, length of 1.5 \u00c5, distance to the surface of 1.5 \u00c5, curvature of 1.0, throughput of 0.92, and number of residues 11; tunnel-2 (green) is a bottleneck radius of 1.5 \u00c5, length of 5.4 \u00c5, distance to surface of 4.9 \u00c5, curvature of 1.1, throughput of 0.78, and number of residues 14 ( Figure 5 , Figures S7-S8 ). The estimated high throughput tunnel-1 (blue) in ORF14 protein is a bottleneck radius of 1.2 \u00c5, length of 5.8 \u00c5, distance to the surface of 4.9 \u00c5, curvature of 1.2, throughput of 0.69, and number of residues 14 ( Figure 7 ; Figure S9 ).\nStructural comparison of SARS-CoV-2 9b protein (97 aa residues) with the crystal structure of SARS-CoV ORF9b protein (79 aa residues; PDB ID 2 CME), which shared 70.93% sequence identity (89% query coverage) showed minor differences in the number of strands, helices, and beta turns (SARS-CoV: 6 strands, 1 helix, 7 beta turns, 3 gamma turns; SARS-CoV-2: 7strands, 4 helices, 5 beta turns). This difference in the increase in the number of helices and strands may be due to increased sequence length in the SARS-CoV-2 9b protein. Changes in the DNA sequence will therefore affect both the conventional and alternative ORF, limiting the rate and extent to which the corresponding proteins can evolve [14] . The structure of SARS-CoV ORF9b is a 2-fold symmetric dimer constructed from two adjacent twisted \u03b2 sheets [36] . Each of these sheets is formed from \u03b2 strands contributed by both monomers, which form a highly interlocked architecture reminiscent of a handshake. The interdigitated nature of the ORF9b dimer rests on a highly unusual topology of largely antiparallel \u03b2 sheets in which monomers wrap around each other [36] . The accessory ORF14 described only by Marra et al. [14] is still an uncharacterized protein, and very little is known about its structure and interactions. ORF14 has no significant sequence homology to proteins in other coronaviruses. It belongs to the group of proteins, named as predicted unknown proteins (PUPs), and is unique to SARS-CoV [15, 37] . Interactions among SARS-CoV accessory proteins were studied using a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay [15, 37] . Self-interactions were observed with 9b and ORF14, indicating the formation of dimeric or multimeric complexes in the nucleus, similar to the findings of von Brunn et al. [15] . ORF9b and ORF14 interacted with themselves, indicating the formation of dimeric or multimeric complexes [15] . ORF9b and ORF14 self-interactions were also found in the co-Immunoprecipitation (CoIP) assay. \u03b1-Galactosidase and \u03b2-galactosidase assays of protein interactions of 9b-9b, 8a-9b, and ORF14-ORF14 demonstrated self-interactions [15, 37] ."}, {"section_title": "Proteomics Profiles of 9b and ORF14. The InterProScan", "text": "Search Result of ORF9b protein has revealed that it belongs to protein family-protein 9b and SARS-like (IPR018542) (Figure 8 ). This is a family of proteins found in SARS and SARS-like coronaviruses. It includes protein 9b from SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), human SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and bat coronaviruses. Protein 9b is one of 8 accessory proteins in SARS-CoV [38] . The gene (ORF9b, also known as ORF13) that encodes this protein is included within the nucleocapsid (N) gene (alternative ORF) [39] . The ORF9b accessory protein is associated with the spike and nucleocapsid proteins and has unusual membranebinding properties [14, 36] . SARS-CoV ORF9b has been shown to localize to the outer mitochondrial membrane and target mitochondrial antiviral signaling proteins (MAVS), suppressing innate immunity [40, 41] . Antibodies against SARS-CoV ORF9b have been found in patients, demonstrating that it is produced during infection [36, 42] . Protein 9b from SARS-CoV comprises 98 amino acids, the structure of which has a novel fold that forms a dimeric tent-like beta structure with an amphipathic surface, and a central hydrophobic cavity that binds lipid molecules [36] . This cavity is likely involved in membrane attachment [36] . The sequence of ORF9b is well conserved in different SARS isolates; however, there is little homology between protein 9b from SARS-CoV and the I-protein (protein 9b homologue) present in other coronaviruses [39, 43] .\nInterProScan Search Result of ORF14 protein revealed its family of membership as protein 14, SARS-like (IPR035113) (Protein 14_ SARS-like) (Figure 9 ). This is a family of unknown functions found in SARS and SARS-like coronaviruses. It includes uncharacterized protein 14 from SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), human SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and bat coronavirus Rp3/2004 (SARS-like coronavirus Rp3) [14] . In SARS-CoV, ORF14 is completely contained within the ORF encoding the nucleocapsid protein (N) [38] . In SARS-CoV-2, uncharacterized protein 14 was predicted to contain one transmembrane helix. The ORF14 Protein 9b shows its subcellular location as a host cytoplasmic vesicle membrane, peripheral membrane protein, and host cytoplasm that binds noncovalently to intracellular lipid bilayers. Gene ontology revealed the cellular components of the host cell cytoplasmic vesicle membrane, and the subunit structure is homodimer with binary interactions. ORF14 protein may play a role in host-virus interactionsubcellular location: membrane sequence analysis and single-pass membrane protein sequence analysis. The topology of gene ontology exhibits cellular components, integral components of the membrane, transmembrane, and transmembrane helices. The domain profile of ORF9b resembles the Sarbecovirus 9b domain profile (PROSITE entry PS51920). Coronaviruses are divided into four genera: \u03b1-coronavirus, \u03b2-coronavirus, Figure 5 : Structure of SARS-CoV-2 9b protein and its two high-throughput tunnels. Tunnels are colored on the basis of preferences in throughput values, i.e., tunnel-1 (blue) and tunnel-2 (green). The high relevance pocket is shown (yellow). Coronaviruses code for the characteristic proteins replicase polyprotein (pp1ab), spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. In addition, Sarbecoviruses code for subgroup-specific accessory proteins that are thought to be dispensable for viral replication in cell culture but may be important for virus-host interactions and thus contribute to virus fitness.\nTo achieve the optimum output from their limited genomes, viruses frequently make use of alternative open reading frames, in which translation is initiated from a start codon within an existing gene and, being out of frame, gives rise to a distinct protein product. ORF9b codes for a small accessory protein of 98 amino acid residues, which are found in Sarbecovirus-infected cells. The ORF9b protein (p9b) has been shown to self-interact and interact with nsp5, nsp14, and the accessory protein p6. The function of p9b is unknown, although it has been suggested that it specifically recognizes and binds to intracellular vesicular. The 9b protein could have a role in membrane interactions during the assembly of the virus membranes [36, 44, 45] .\nThe 9b domain has a fold with seven \u03b2-strands (PDB ID: 2CME). The \u03b2-strands from two molecules form two adjacent twisted \u03b2-sheets, resulting in a highly interlocked handshake structure that contains a hydrophobic central cavity, which binds to lipids and stabilizes the molecule (Meier et al., 2006) [36] . Protein 9b is a homodimer that plays a role in membrane interactions during the assembly of the virus.\nPROSITE analysis of ORF14 protein also estimated three sites: (i)PS00005 PKC_PHOSPHO_SITE Protein kinase C phosphorylation site (aa 19-21), (ii) PS00008 MYRISTYL N-myristoylation site (aa [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] , and (iii) PS00006 CK2_ PHOSPHO_SITE Casein kinase II phosphorylation site (aa [39] [40] [41] [42] .\nCasein kinase II (CK-2) is a protein serine/threonine kinase whose activity is independent of cyclic nucleotides and calcium. CK-2 phosphorylates many different proteins [46] . N-myristoylation site, an appreciable number of eukaryotic proteins are acylated by the covalent addition of myristate (a C14-saturated fatty acid) to their N-terminal residue via an amide linkage [47, 48] . The sequence specificity of the enzyme responsible for this modification, myristoyl CoA:protein N-myristoyl transferase (NMT), has been derived from the sequence of known N-myristoylated proteins and from studies using synthetic peptides [48] . In vivo, protein kinase C exhibits a preference for the phosphorylation of serine or threonine residues found close to a Cterminal basic residue (Meier et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2014) . The presence of additional basic residues at the N-or Cterminal of the target amino acid enhances the V max and K m of the phosphorylation reaction [49] .\nThe instability index values of the ORF9b and ORF14 proteins of SARS-COV-2 were 33.11 and 32.56, respectively, which classifies both proteins were stable ( Table 2 ). The aliphatic indices of SARS-COV2 9b and ORF14 were 105.46 and 125.62, respectively, indicating high thermal stability in both proteins ( Table 2 ). The grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) values of the 9b and ORF14 proteins are computed as -0.085 and 0.603, respectively, which indicates that protein 9b is hydrophilic and ORF14 is hydrophobic in nature ( Table 2 ; Figures S10 and S11).\nA comparison made in this study on the physicochemical parameters of ORF9b and ORF14 proteins among the different coronaviruses showed that ORF9 protein of SARS-CoV-2 has 76.53% sequence identity with Rhinolophus affinis coronavirus, 74.23% with human CoV, and 73.20% with bat SARS-CoV. The ORF14 protein of SARS-CoV-2 has 92.86% identity with the ORF14 protein of bat coronavirus, 78.57% with human SARS-CoV, 77.14% with civet and Rhinolophus affinis coronavirus. The ORF9 protein showed a wide range of isoelectric points from 4.9 (human and civet SARS-CoV) to 6.56 (human SARS-CoV-2). The instability index values of ORF9b of coronaviruses ranged from 33.11 (human SARS-CoV-2) to 41.80 (bat CoV) ( Table 2 ). The instability index values of ORF14 of coronaviruses ranged from 25.59 (bat CoV) to 32.81 (R. affinis CoV) ( Table 2 ). This indicates higher stability of the ORF14 protein than the ORF9 protein. The grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) values were computed in the range of -0.176 to -0.012 in ORF9b protein and 0.196 to 0.603 in ORF14, indicating that ORF9b protein is hydrophilic and ORF14 is hydrophobic in nature ( Table 2 ). The physicochemical parameters, including amino acid composition, pI, instability index and hydropathicity of SARS-CoV-2, showed higher identity with bat SARS-CoV ( Table 2) .\nThe functional analysis results of Profunc have been presented in Table 3 . Of the nine (09) estimated cavity points in the structure of the 9b protein, the cavity-1 produced by amino acids \"NPQVDKGEYTAMIFRLS\" is with xyz coordinates of 10.606, -3.416, and -5.832 and a volume of 1261 \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m cube; the cavity-2 produced by the amino acids \"DKQPRVELNTFYIAM\" is with cavity point 10.014, -0.066, and 5.372 and a volume of 971 \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m cube ( Figure 5 ; Table S1 ). Out of the 10 potential cavities for computed active sites for the function of ORF14 protein, cavity-1 is represented by amino acids \"HEPIATVLKWCDMY,\" with xyz coordinates of -7.341, 17.615, and -5.427 and a volume of 662 \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m cube; the cavity-2 with amino acids Table S2 ).

The present study strongly supports that like the human host the coronavirus had undergone rapid evolution in bats and pangolin as an amplifying host ( Figure 12 ). Earlier research claimed that snakes or pangolins may be intermediate hosts for creating the coronavirus by recombination events [50] . Cross-species transmission of zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs) can result in disease outbreaks [51] . Molecular analysis supported bats as natural hosts for SARS-CoV, but palm civets (Paguma larvata) had a critical role in the transmission to humans [52, 53] . Bats are implicated in SARS-CoV-2 origin. A very similar SARS-CoV-2 strain (RaTG13 CoV) was detected in Rhinolophus affinis bat with 96% genome similarity compared with SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence. Considering that bats were in hibernation when the outbreak occurred, the virus is more likely to have been transmitted via other species [54] . Both protein (9b and ORF14) genome phylogeny results of the present study are supported by the hypothesis for the zoonotic transmission route was constructed based on contact with Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) by visitors of Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, China [55] . The close phylogenetic relationship to RaTG13 provides evidence that 2019-nCoV may have originated in bats [10] . Differently from bats, which are able to suppress viral replication, pangolin is an amplifying host which allows the increase of viral load and accelerated SARS-CoV-2 jump to human host and humanto-human transmission subsequently [56] .\nAnother study, which supports the results of present finding, showed that the bat and pangolin coronaviruses were the most related to SARS-CoV-2 with 96% and 86% of identity all along the genome [57] . The comparison study from bat and pangolin by Li and his friends explains that BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 virus was more similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus than the coronavirus obtained from the two pangolin samples (SRR10168377 and SRR10168378). The human SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is responsible for the recent outbreak of COVID-19, did not come directly from pangolins [13] .\nTunnels are access paths connecting the interior of molecular systems with the surrounding environment. The presence of tunnels in proteins influences their reactivity, as they determine the nature and intensity of their interactions. Tunnel analysis of the newly predicted structures of the present study has estimated the presence of multiple tunnels in [36] . The presence of multiple tunnels in this so far uncharacterized protein may take a key role in a large number of transport pathways for small ligands influencing their reactivity. It has been experimentally demonstrated that the tunnels and their properties can define many important protein characteristics like substrate specificity, enantioselectivity, stability, and activity [58] . The details of the structure verification report have been deposited to Modelarchive and will be available to download along with the structures (https://www.modelarchive.org/ doi/10.xxxx/). Several years before the outbreak of SARS, two other zoonotic viruses, Nipah virus and Hendra virus, emerged in Asia and Australia; they were both known to originate from bats [59, 60] . This led scientists to consider bats in the search for reservoirs of SARS-CoV. The present study on the evolution of 9b and ORF14 also highly indicates the bat origin for the newly emerged human SARS-CoV-2. Understanding the bat origin of human coronaviruses is helpful for the prediction and prevention of another pandemic emergence in the future [61] .\nIn a recent correspondence published in Nature Medicine, Andersen et al. [16] clearly showed that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus. The potential for close contact between bats, civets, and humans in the wildlife trade in southern China, coupled with a possible propensity of these bats to foster CoV hostshifts, could explain SARS-like CoVs as the source of SARS-CoV [8] . This potential supports molecular results on bat CoVs that suggest a recent host shift from bats to civets or other animals and humans [62] . A recent study also reported that the sequence of bat coronavirus RaTG13, sampled from a Rhinolophus affinis bat, is~96% identical overall to SARS-CoV-2 [10] . With human activity increasingly overlapping the habitats of bats, disease outbreaks resulting from spillover of bat coronaviruses will continue to occur in the future, despite the fact that direct transmission of bat coronaviruses to humans appears to be rare [61] . "}, {"section_title": "10", "text": "BioMed Research International\nIt is reasonable to propose that ORF9b in SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to viral pathogenesis as I-protein in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) does. The interactions between S, N, and ORF9b may help to localize ORF9b inside the particles but closer to the envelope. The structure of ORF9b, an intertwined dimer with an amphipathic outer surface and a long hydrophobic lipid binding tunnel, suggests how this protein may interact, via an unusual anchoring mechanism, with compartments of the ER-Golgi network to act as an accessory protein during the assembly of the SARS virion (Meier et al., 2006) . However, further analyses of the properties and functions of ORF9b and ORF14 proteins are still necessary to understand its contribution to virus pathogenesis. All current studies on accessory proteins of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, suggest that they are not essential for virus replication [63] but do affect viral release, stability, and pathogenesis and finally contribute to virulence [64] ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 has 29.9 kb nucleotides, encoding 14 open reading frames (ORFs) for 29 proteins, although one may not be expressed.

The present study reported theoretical modeling, sequence-based, and structure-based functional characterization of two accessory protein-9b and ORF14 of SARS-CoV-2 p. Phylogenetic analysis of both proteins revealed a close evolutionary relationship between the newly emerged human SARS-CoV-2 and bat SARS-like corona virus. The whole-genome phylogeny indicates that 2019-nCoV may have originated in bat, undergone rapid evolution in bats, and pangolin may more likely to be an amplifying host. The presence of a large number of tunnels in the 9b protein indicates its high reactivity. The theoretical structures and statistical verification reports were successfully deposited in the Model Archive. The theoretical structures would perhaps be useful for advanced computational analysis of interactions of each protein for detailed functional analysis, understanding of viral pathogenesis and virulence for structure-based drug design, or to study potential vaccines, if at all, towards to prevent epidemics and pandemics in the absence of a complete experimental structure."}, {"section_title": "Data Availability", "text": "(1) The resultant protein structures are deposited in Mode-lArchive (https://www.modelarchive.org/).
