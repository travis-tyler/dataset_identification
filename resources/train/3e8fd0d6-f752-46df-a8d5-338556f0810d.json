Like 8 SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the beta genus Coronavirus in the 9 Corornaviridae family (Lu et al., 2020) . Clinically, several papers showed that most COVID-10 19 patients developed lymphopenia as well as pneumonia with higher plasma levels of pro-11 inflammatory cytokines in severe cases (Chan et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 12 2020), suggesting that the host immune system is involved in the pathogenesis (Mahallawi 13 et al., 2018; Nicholls et al., 2003) . Patients infected by SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV were 14 previously reported to have antibody responses (Ko et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2004; Wang et al., (Thevarajan et al., 2020) .

Sera from three healthy donors (Wang et al., 2016) were obtained before the 18 SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (healthy donor #1-3). 3 additional healthy donors (#4-6) who had 19 been in close contacts with the patients were recruited in this study. Human AB serum 20 collected from healthy male AB donors in the US (GemCell, CA) was used as a negative 21 control.\nTo explore cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, we isolated peripheral blood 16 monocytic cells (PBMCs) from the whole blood and phenotypically analyzed them by flow 17 cytometry ( Figure 3A ).

Escherichia coli transformed with pET28-N-6xHis was 25 lysed and tested by Coomassie blue staining to confirm NP expression at 45.51 kDa. NP 26 was further purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and gel filtration. The purity of NP 27 was approximately 90% ( Figure S1A ). The presence of NP was subsequently confirmed by 28 anti-Flag antibody ( Figure S1B ). The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein (S-RBD) 1 and main protease (Lan et al., 2020) were produced by a Baculovirus insect expression 2 system and purified to a purity of 90% ( Figure S1A ).\nshowed higher amounts of anti-NP IgG3, whereas anti-S-RBD IgG3 was detected in two 23 patients (Pt#4-5).

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were also more 11 obviously observed than IgM in the follow-up patients (#9-14), when compared with healthy 12 donors ( Figure 1B ).
