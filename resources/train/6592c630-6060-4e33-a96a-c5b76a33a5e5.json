At autopsy, AD neuritic plaque pathology consists of extracellular aggregates of the \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) peptide, which is derived from proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Rare gene mutations in APP along with the presenilin 1 gene (PSEN1) and presenilin 2 gene (PSEN2), encoding components of the \u03b3-secretase enzyme involved in APP processing, cause early-onset familial AD. 1 Further, an uncommon APP coding variant (frequency <1%) was recently discovered to be protective against AD in the Icelandic population. 2 However, common genetic variation at these loci has not been definitively linked to the later-onset form of disease that accounts for the majority of AD in the population. [3] [4] [5] [6] Common polymorphisms in the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) are wellestablished risk factors for late-onset AD, and recent investigations suggest that APOE participates in the aggregation and/or clearance of A\u03b2 within the central nervous system. 7 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several additional AD susceptibility loci, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] and emerging evidence suggests that alterations in A\u03b2 dynamics may explain some of these associations. One susceptibility locus, clusterin (CLU), encodes an apolipoprotein that binds A\u03b2, similar to APOE, and these proteins may jointly regulate A\u03b2 accumulation. 13 In addition, we previously reported that the effects of both APOE and complement receptor 1 (CR1) on memory decline are mediated in part by an association with neuritic plaque burden, 14, 15 and the complement pathway has also been implicated in brain A\u03b2 deposition in murine models. 16 Lastly, the phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein gene (PICALM) has been shown to modulate A\u03b2 toxicity in a yeast model system and in rat cortical neuron culture."}, {"section_title": "17", "text": "These studies reinforce the broader hypothesis that genetic networks affecting A\u03b2 accumulation and/or aggregation in the brain may be important determinants of AD susceptibility. However, it is possible that not all AD risk variants will similarly affect the development of neuritic plaque pathology, as many other cellular processes likely impinge on the clinical manifestation of disease. Notably, genome-wide metaanalyses have identified a number of additional susceptibility loci with still undefined roles in AD pathogenesis. 9, 10 Although gene discovery in AD has largely focused on clinically diagnosed disease in case-control studies, it is now recognized that the AD pathophysiological process, including A\u03b2 deposition in the brain, begins years before the development of dementia. In prospective, community-based autopsy studies, about 90% of persons with clinically diagnosed AD have the disease proven at autopsy. 18, 19 However, AD is also the predominant brain lesion accounting for mild cognitive impairment, now recognized as a prodromal form of AD. Further, in older autopsy cohorts of subjects with normal cognition, a substantial minority of brains meet pathologic diagnostic criteria for AD. 18, 19 More recently, positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ligands, including Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB), have been developed to detect fibrillar A\u03b2 pathology in living subjects. [20] [21] [22] Similar to postmortem studies, positive PiB imaging is detected in a substantial minority of subjects with normal cognition, and this proportion increases with age. The realization that A\u03b2 pathology may represent the earliest changes of AD informed the recent revision of diagnostic criteria, including the development of research guidelines for preclinical AD for individuals with biomarker changes, such as increased PiB amyloid, but with preserved cognition. 23 Many genetic and environmental risk factors might be expected to accelerate preclinical AD brain changes and ultimately promote susceptibility for clinical disease. Indeed, the APOE \u03b54 risk allele is associated with increased fibrillar A\u03b2 deposition, based on PiB-PET, as well concomitant changes in cerebrospinal fluid A\u03b2, even in individuals with normal cognition. 22, 24 The presence of substantial amounts of AD pathology in older subjects with little or no cognitive impairment might be expected to degrade the power of AD case-control GWAS to discover variants affecting the earliest brain pathologic correlates of AD. We and others have promoted using disease endophenotypes, including AD pathology, as a complementary approach. 25, 26 Herein, extending our prior work on APOE, CR1, CLU, and PICALM, we investigate whether newly reported AD risk alleles 9, 10, 12 are also associated with a quantitative measure of neuritic plaque burden in a large autopsy cohort. We identify associations at 2 other loci, CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) and the adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette, subfamily A, member 7 (ABCA7). We then perform a GWAS to discover additional susceptibility loci for neuritic plaque pathology. Among our top results, we discover a variant near the APP locus that is also associated with fibrillar A\u03b2 in 2 independent cohorts of cognitively normal subjects with PET imaging. Our findings relate validated AD susceptibility alleles to the development of AD neuritic plaques and begin to reveal the genetic architecture underlying the earliest known brain pathologic changes of AD.

For analyses of candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the joint ROS/MAP cohort included 725 subjects (408 ROS and 317 MAP) with genotyping and completed autopsies. The GWAS was based on a previously published subset of 651 subjects. 29 For replication, we relied on 2 additional study cohorts with brain PET imaging of fibrillar A\u03b2 (eTable 5): the Arizona APOE cohort (n = 56) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (n = 58). The Arizona APOE cohort is a longitudinal study of cognitively normal subjects with PiB-PET imaging, including APOE \u03b54 homozygotes, heterozygotes, and noncarriers. 22 The cognitively normal subsample of ADNI (www.adni-info.org) included subjects with genotyping and PET imaging using the florbetapir ligand Avid-45."}, {"section_title": "Clinical and Postmortem Evaluation", "text": "The clinical diagnoses of dementia and AD were made following National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association recommendations. 30 Level of cognition was based on 17 cognitive tests performed at annual evaluations proximate to death. 14 Modified Bielschowsky silver stain was used to visualize neuritic plaques, diffuse plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles in tissue sections from the midfrontal, middle temporal, inferior parietal, and entorhinal cortices and the hippocampal CA1 sector. As in prior work, 14 ,25 a quantitative composite score for neuritic plaque pathologic burden was created by dividing the raw counts in each region by the population standard deviation of the region-specific counts and then averaging the scaled counts over the 5 brain regions to create a single standardized summary measure. The A\u03b2 load was additionally measured based on anti-A\u03b2 immunohistochemistry.

In the candidate analyses of AD SNPs, P < .05 was considered statistically significant. For the genome-wide association analyses, statistical significance was set at P < 5 \u00d7 10 \u22128 , and P < 1 \u00d7 10 \u22124 was considered suggestive evidence of association. Secondary analyses included adjustment for cognitive status proximate to death (eTable 7) and APOE \u03b54 genotype (0, 1, or 2 copies) (eTable 3 and eTable 8), and we also tested for associations with AD susceptibility (eTable 9). Analyses of SNP effects on global cognitive and episodic memory decline and incident AD were performed as in prior work.\n14 For the analysis of SNP associations with A\u03b2 PET measurements, cerebral to cerebellar florbetapir standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) images were generated in cognitively normal ADNI subjects and PiB SUVR images were generated in Arizona APOE cohort subjects.

We also performed region of interest analysis on individual PET images, based on previously defined mean cortical and whole-cerebellar templates."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "We studied 725 deceased subjects for whom complete neuropathologic evaluation and genotype data were available (eTable 1). Proximate to death, 42.2% had clinically diagnosed AD, 24.6% had mild cognitive impairment, and 31.7% retained normal cognition. The remaining subjects (n = 21) had dementia due to other causes, as they did not meet clinical criteria for AD. 30 On postmortem examination, 62.5% met National Institute on Aging-Reagan Institute Working Group on Diagnostic Criteria for the Neuropathological Assessment of Alzheimer's Disease pathologic criteria for AD, consistent with the advanced age of this cohort (mean, 88.1 years). We used a quantitative measure of neuritic plaque burden to assess genetic susceptibility for AD neuritic plaque pathology. We first evaluated published AD susceptibility loci from recent clinical case-control GWAS. 9, 10 As previously reported, 14 the CR1 locus was associated with neuritic plaque burden (rs6701713; P = .03), and we additionally found evidence that variants in ABCA7 (rs3764650; P = .03) and CD2AP (rs9349407; P = .03) were associated with neuritic plaque pathology ( Table 1) . For all 3 SNPs, AD risk alleles showed consistent direction of effects for increased neuropathology. By contrast, other recently validated susceptibility loci, including CLU, PICALM, BIN1, MS4A, CD33, and EPHA1, were not associated with neuritic plaques in this cohort. These results suggest that, at least for 3 of the 9 loci discovered in GWAS, effects on neuritic plaque pathology may mediate the association of these polymorphisms with clinical AD risk.\nTo identify novel variants associated with neuritic plaque burden, we performed a genome-wide scan in ROS and MAP using the quantitative pathologic trait. The genomic inflation factor did not reveal any evidence of systematic inflation in our test statistic (\u03bb GC = 1.009) (eFigure 1). The only genomewide significant SNP associations (P < 5 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ) were detected on chromosome 19 near AP OE (rs4420638; P = 1.5 \u00d7 10 \u221217 ). The top independent loci (P < 10 \u22125 ) associated with neuritic plaque burden are shown in Table 2 (see  eTable 2 for detailed results). Among our strongest associations, we identified variants near candidate genes with roles in inflammation and immunity, including prostaglandinendoperoxide synthase 1 (PTGS1, rs12551233; P = 4.8 \u00d7 10 \u22127\n) and the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region of the major histocompatibility complex (HLA-DQA2, rs3892710; P = 2.3 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ). Notably, we also identified a common chromosome 21 SNP (rs2829887; frequency = 0.43; P = 3.3 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ), which is located 149.2 kilobases (kb) from the 3\u2032 end of APP ( Figure 1 ) and is found in an intron of ATP5J. In addition, our GWAS detected evidence of associations at KCNIP4 (rs6817475; P = 3.8 \u00d7 10 \u22127 ) and NMNAT3 (rs4564921; P = 6.1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ), 2 additional genes previously implicated in AD. 32, 33 Given the proximity of rs2829887 to APP, a gene known to be associated with familial AD, we investigated this locus in more detail ( Table 3) . Based on the absence of a statistical interaction (P = .77), the effect of rs2829887 did not vary by cohort, demonstrating consistent associations with neuritic plaque burden in both the ROS sample (\u03b2 = \u22120.124; P = 4.0 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ) and the smaller MAP sample (\u03b2 = \u22120.106; P = .01). Further, the APP locus variant was strongly associated with postmortem A\u03b2 load (P = 9.5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ), which is measured in the same subjects using anti-A\u03b2 immunohistochemistry. The associations between rs2829887 and these neuropathologic traits were robust to adjustment for APOE genotype (eTable 3). Rare mutations in PSEN1 and PSEN2 are also associated with early-onset familial AD 1 ; however, common genetic variation at either locus (\u00b1500 kb) was not found in association with amyloid neuritic plaques in our GWAS data (P > .01).\nThere are few existing prospective, community-based cohorts such as ROS and MAP with large numbers of brain autopsies and assessments of quantitative neuropathology and genome-wide data with which to replicate our findings. To further validate our results, we leveraged data from subjects with PET imaging of fibrillar A\u03b2 (eTable 5). The Arizona APOE cohort consists of 56 subjects with normal cognition and assessment with PiB-PET. Subjects carrying the APOE \u03b54 risk allele were previously shown to have increased levels of PiB amyloid, consistent with early AD pathologic changes in this genetically susceptible subgroup. 22 Compared with ROS and MAP, the Arizona APOE cohort is significantly younger (mean age, 64.6 years), and subjects uniformly have preserved cognition (mean Mini-Mental State Examination score, 29.7). We additionally used data from 58 cognitively normal older adults (mean age, 80.4 years; mean Mini-Mental State Examination score, 29.4) from the ADNI cohort with florbetapir-PET. In a voxel-based joint analysis of the Arizona APOE and ADNI cohorts, rs2829887 was associated with extensive fibrillar A\u03b2 deposition across numerous brain regions, including the cingulate, frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices (P < .005) (Figure 2) . These results were robust to adjustment for age and APOE \u03b54 genotype. Using a Monte Carlo simulation to address multiple regional comparisons, we found 64 743 voxels in which rs2829887 dosage was associated with increased fibrillar A\u03b2 compared with 1313 voxels-in smaller clusters-in which this allele was associated with decreased signal (P < .001). In a complementary analysis based on predefined brain regions of interest, rs2829887 was associated with level of mean cortical fibrillar A\u03b2 (P = .03; see eTable 6 for full results). However, the direction of the association between rs2829887 and fibrillar A\u03b2 in the PET cohorts was opposite to the association with neuritic plaque pathology in ROS and MAP. Specifically, the minor allele, rs2829887 T (ROS and MAP, frequency = 0.43; Arizona APOE and ADNI cohorts, frequency = 0.45) was associated with reduced postmortem neuritic plaques in ROS/MAP but increased PiB/florbetapir SUVRs in the Arizona APOE and ADNI cohorts. Separate analyses of the independent ADNI and Arizona APOE cohorts revealed associations between rs2829887 T and increased A\u03b2 across numerous brain regions (P < .005) (eFigure 2), consistent with the joint analysis. Subjects enrolled in ROS and MAP also receive annual assessment with a comprehensive neuropsychiatric battery, allowing genetic analyses of cognitive decline, as in prior studies. 14 We found that many, but not all, of the SNPs discovered for associations with neuritic plaque pathology also showed associations with longitudinal decline in global cognition and episodic memory (eTable 4); pathology-increasing alleles showed consistent direction of effects on the cognitive outcomes, accelerating rate of decline. We further developed an aggregate genetic risk score model incorporating the top 53 independently associated SNPs (P < 10\n) from the neuritic plaque GWAS. This model was strongly associated with global cognitive (P = 1.1 \u00d7 10 \u221216 ) and episodic memory (P = 7.9 \u00d7 10 \u221221\n) decline and remained highly significant after excluding APOE SNPs from the model (P global = 4.8 \u00d7 10 \u221214 ;\nP memory = 1.2 \u00d7 10 \u221217 ). Thus, the top of the results distribution from our AD neuritic plaque pathology GWAS is significantly enriched for loci that are also pertinent for decline in cognitive function. Notably, the APP locus SNP, rs2829887, was not related to clinical AD diagnosis (P = .63) (Table 3) , change in global cognition (P = .58), change in episodic memory (P = .41), or incident AD (P = .38). These results may be explained by the presence of substantial AD pathology in individuals with mild or Abbreviation: AD, Alzheimer disease. a Neuritic plaque burden was based on silver-stained tissue, and amyloid load was determined from \u03b2-amyloid immunohistochemistry.

Despite smaller sample sizes, the association with clinical AD was significant (odds ratio = 0.64; P = .002) in an analysis limited to clinically diagnosed and pathologically confirmed cases (n = 244) and controls without substantial AD pathology (n = 212). We further found that the association of rs2829887 with neuritic plaque pathology does not vary by clinical diagnosis proximate to death, demonstrating consistent effects (\u03b2 values) in subjects with (\u03b2 = \u22120.109; P = .008) or without (\u03b2 = \u22120.108; P = 6.1 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ) dementia. In an analysis restricted to the relatively few subjects with no cognitive impairment similar to our PET samples (n = 229), rs2829887 remained associated with A\u03b2 load (\u03b2 = \u22120.173; P = .046) and showed a trend toward an association with neuritic plaque burden (\u03b2 = \u22120.068; P = .09). These results suggest that rs2829887 affects susceptibility for the earliest brain amyloid changes preceding overt cognitive impairment."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Besides APOE and CR1, we found that AD susceptibility alleles at the ABCA7 and CD2AP loci were associated with increased neuritic plaque pathology. The results suggest a potential mechanism for the effect of these loci on the clinical manifestations of AD. While our study was not sufficiently powered to definitively exclude associations for the other AD susceptibility variants (see later), it is possible that some of these loci predominantly affect pathogenic steps downstream of neuritic plaque deposition, such as synaptic loss, neuronal death, or the manifestation of cognitive changes. It is also plausible that some AD susceptibility loci affect other, non-AD related mechanisms that contribute to cognitive changes and the development of the clinical AD phenotype, which is known to be pathologically heterogeneous. 19 The strongest support for a genetic link between A\u03b2 pathology and AD risk comes from the established connection between rare mutations in APP and autosomal dominant, earlyonset familial AD. 1 Further, an uncommon APP variant, A673T\n(frequency <1%), was recently discovered to confer protection against AD. 2 Although common APP polymorphisms have been evaluated in numerous association studies of late-onset AD, a definitive link has yet to be established, [3] [4] [5] [6] and APP has not emerged from AD GWAS. 9, 10 It is intriguing that our study discovered common variants near APP among the top loci associated with neuritic plaque burden. The strongest variant, rs2829887, fell within 150 kb of the 3\u2032 end of the APP transcription unit, within an intron of ATP5J. No other adjacent genes (JAM2, GABPA, MRPL39) are known to be involved in amyloidogenesis. While APP is a compelling candidate, the causal variant(s) and responsible gene(s) require confirmation. rs2829887 may tag a haplotype associated with altered APP protein processing or gene expression, similar to other rare diseasecausing mutations or duplications. 34 We found additional support for the APP locus based on evaluation of 2 independent cohorts of cognitively normal, older adults with PET imaging. While intriguing, this association was in the opposite direction for PET A\u03b2 compared with directly measured neuritic plaques or A\u03b2 load, which may be due to differences in the cohorts (eg, participant age) or the outcome phenotypes (postmortem A\u03b2 load vs PET A\u03b2). Our GWAS identified other candidate susceptibility genes that will require replication. rs6817475 falls within an intron of KCNIP4, encoding a potassium channel-interacting protein. Notably, KCNIP4 physically interacts with PSEN2 35 and alters A\u03b2 dynamics in cultured cells 32 ; further, insertiondeletion polymorphisms in the KCNIP4 promoter were associated with AD in a small case-control autopsy cohort. Also, rs12551233 is within an intron of PTGS1, also known as cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1), which encodes a key regulator of inflammation. Increased COX1 along with other inflammatory markers have been previously described in association with neuritic plaque pathology. 36 We also detected the SNP rs3892710 within the HLA locus (HLA-DQA2), which encodes the class II major histocompatibility complex on antigen-presenting cells and regulates adaptive immune responses. Our finding of associations at COX1 and the MHC locus, along with the established roles of CR1, CD33, and MS4A, supports immune responses and neuroinflammation as important determinants of AD pathogenesis. Finally, we note an association between an SNP in the nicotinamide nucleotide adenylyltransferase 3 gene (NMNAT3, rs4564921) and neuritic plaque burden. This enzyme family has demonstrated neuroprotective activities in experimental models, 37 and the NMNAT3 locus was previously implicated in an AD genome-wide scan. 33 The main strength of our study comes from its use of 2 prospective, community-based, autopsy cohorts with uniform, quantitative assessment of neuritic plaque pathology along with thorough clinical assessment proximate to death. However, we ultimately had insufficient power to discover novel genomewide significant susceptibility loci for neuritic plaque pathology. Importantly, both cohorts are ongoing, which will allow better-powered studies in the future, including genetic analyses of other informative pathologic traits (eg, neurofibrillary tangles, neurons, dendritic spines, and synaptic protein markers)."}, {"section_title": "38", "text": "Given our current sample size, a polymorphism would need to explain at least 6.7% of the variance in pathologic burden for us to have 90% power for discovery at genome-wide significance. Based on the effect size of rs2829887 in the APP locus, which explains 3.5% of the variance in neuritic plaque burden, we estimate that a sample size of 1300 will be needed to have 90% power to establish a significant association."}]
