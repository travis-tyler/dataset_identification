The divorce rate in America is calculated as the number of divorces per 1,000 married women, during the late 1980s and early 1990s, the divorce rate reached a historic high of 22.6 divorces (United States Census Bureau, 2013). Given the large number of children affected by divorce, research has focused on why and how divorce affects children's adjustment. Research consistently shows a negative relationship between parental divorce and children's well-being. For example, children from divorced families have been found to have higher rates of depression (Strohschein, 2005) and antisocial behaviors (Vandewater & Lansford, 1998). In addition to these measures, educational success is an important indicator of children's adjustment. Studies have found parental divorce to have a significant negative effect on children's educational success, such as academic achievement and attainment (Amato, 2001;Amato & Keith, 1991;Frisco et al., 2007;Lansford, 2009;Potter, 2010;Sun & Li, 2001;Sun & Li, 2011). Among children of divorce, relatively few studies have examined educational success after high school. Even less research on the effect of parental divorce has focused on children obtaining graduate degrees. Research is especially needed on the post-secondary educational outcomes of children of divorce. A college degree has never been more important to the economic success of American adults. The percentage of men and women with a four-year college degree increased by an average of 73% between 2000 and 2013 (U.S. Department of Education, 2014). Master's, professional, and/or doctoral degree have become a requirement for entry into many professions and is strongly related to income (Thomas & Zhang, 2005). Jobs requiring a graduate degree are expected to grow by an average of 18% between 2008 and 2018 in the United States, \"due to the growing shift towards a knowledge-based economy\" (Crosby & Moncarz, 2006, p. 46). Post-baccalaureate enrollment had been steady at 1.6 million in the late 1970s and early 1980s but rose 78% between 1985 and 2010 with a majority of the increase due to enrollment during 2008-2010 (U.S."}, {"section_title": "Department of Education, 2013)", "text": ". A Master's, Professional (M.D., D.D.S., J.D.) and Doctoral degrees increased by an average of 70% between 2000 and 2013 with each degree increasing by 68%, 83%, and 75%, respectively (U.S. Department of Education, 2014). There has been a wealth of research dedicated to understanding the effects of parental divorce on children. In particular, research has focused on the variety of negative effects of parental divorce on children's educational success. In terms of negative elementary educational success, research has found children from divorced families have lower math and reading scores and lower school engagement compared to their in-tact family counterparts (Amato, 2000(Amato, , 2010Brown, 2010;Chatterji, 2005;Gennetian, 2005;Lee & Brown, 2006;Magnuson & Berger, 2009;Potter, 2010;Strohschein, 2005;Shriner et al., 2009;Sun & Li, 2001, 2011Teachman, 2007Vandewater & Lansford, 1998). Divorce scholars have also extended their analysis to children's secondary (e.g., high school) educational success, finding parental divorce continues to have a negative effect on children's secondary standardized test scores, grade point averages, drop-out/completion rates and school participation (Anguiano, 2004;Boyce Rodgers & Rose, 2001;Carlson & Corcoran, 2001;Cavanagh, Schiller, & Riegle-Crumb, 2006;Falci, 2006;Frisco et al., 2007;Gennetian, 2005;Ginther & Pollak, 2004;Heard, 2007;Hill et al., 2004;Melby et al., 2008;Magnuson & Berger, 2009;Qian & Blair, 1999;Teachman, Paasch, & Carver, 1996;Tillman, 2007). Within the last two decades, the divorce literature has begun to investigate parental divorce effects on adult children's post-secondary (e.g., college) educational success, such as entrance rates into college and bachelor's degree completion (Black & Sufi, 2002;Bulduc, Caron, & Logue, 2007;Conley, 2001;Perna & Titus, 2005), finding there are long-term problems for children from divorced families. There are a few studies which have investigated post-baccalaureate educational attainment of children from non-intact versus intact families (Bj\u00f6rklund & Sundstr\u00f6m, 2006;Bj\u00f6rklund, Ginther, & Sundstr\u00f6m, 2007). However, these studies focus on family structure as opposed to parental divorce specifically; they also do not attempt to understand the mechanisms underlying this relationship. Therefore, we do not have a clear picture of the effect of divorce on children's post-baccalaureate educational attainment. An important variable associated with children's educational success, particularly elementary and secondary education, is parental educational expectations (Davis-Kean, 2005;Dika & Singh, 2002;Fan & Chen, 2001;Englund et al., 2004;Kim & Schnieder, 2005;Perna & Titus, 2005;Reynolds & Burge, 2008). In terms of young adult's educational success, the relationship between parental educational expectations and children's post-baccalaureate educational attainment has yet to be examined. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth of 1997, the purpose of this thesis is to investigate whether and how parental divorce affects children's post-baccalaureate educational attainment. In particular, I assess the extent to which these educational expectations might explain the association between parental divorce and children's post-baccalaureate educational attainment."}, {"section_title": "BACKGROUND AND THEORETICAL APPROACH", "text": "The American family has gone through remarkable changes in the last five decades. There are now a multitude of family structures present in today's society including married, divorced, cohabitating, stepfamilies, single, foster, same sex couples, and intergenerational households. Nevertheless, marriage remains a coveted status in society, with much of the early research on family change using stable married families as the reference group in analytic models. Decades of research have been dedicated to understanding the effect of parental divorce on children. Research has found that children who experienced parental divorce are at risk for a variety of negative outcomes (Amato, 2010;Cherlin et al., 1991;Lansford, 2009). Research has measured children's educational success in a variety of ways, including elementary reading and math scores, secondary grade point average (GPA), standardized test scores (ACT, SAT, etc.), school engagement, participation in extracurricular activities, and cognitive test scores (PIAT). These studies have consistently found a negative relationship between parental divorce or otherwise non-intact family structure and children's educational success (Chatterji, 2005;Carlson & Corcoran, 2001;Cavanagh, Schiller, & Riegle-Crumb, 2006;Frisco et al., 2007;Gennetian, 2005;Ginther & Pollak, 2004;Magnuson & Berger, 2009;Shriner et al., 2009;Sun & Li, 2011;Teachman, 2007). For example, Carlson and Corcoran (2001) used data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth of 1979 (NLSY79) to study the effect of various family structures on children's (ages 7 to 10) cognitive outcomes. The results showed on both measures of math and reading recognition, children from two-parent homes since birth, on average, significantly out-achieved children from single-parent and multiple transition homes by 80%. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 child and young adult cohort, Gennetian (2005) found similar results. A limitation these studies are their focus on young children and adolescents. Yet, Cherlin et al. (1998) maintains that some negative impacts of parental divorce during childhood may not manifest itself until late adolescence and/or adulthood. For example, Lansford (2009) found that parental divorce contributes to higher levels of long-term internalizing and externalizing problems into adulthood. There have been studies conducted using older children (over age 18) of parental divorce, but they have tended to focus on social and behavioral outcomes, as opposed to educational outcomes. Such as, these studies investigated the effects of parental divorce on children's romantic relationships, attitudes towards marriage and divorce, parent and adult-child relationship quality (Amato, 2000). Another limitation is the lack of studies based on longitudinal and nationally representative samples, especially when it comes to educational outcomes. However, there have been some notable researchers that have used longitudinal research (lasting 20 years or more) to understand the long-term implications of divorce and its effect on the children (Ahrons, 2004(Ahrons, , 2006Hetherington, 2003;Hetherington & Kelly, 2002;Wallerstein & Kelly, 1980). Hetherington studied 900 youth spread between nondivorced, divorced, and remarried families over a 25-year period, finding many of the adult children from divorced families experienced difficulties in romantic relationships and parenthood later in life. Research consistently shows differences between traditional intact families and non-intact families (e.g., single-parent, blended families, stepfamilies) in children's educational outcomes (Anguiano, 2004;Heard, 2007;Jeynes, 2006;Stewart, 2002;Tillman, 2008). Educational success is strongly influenced by the makeup of the family structure for young children (Amato, 2000;Amato & Cheadle, 2005), adolescents (Teachman, Paasch, & Carver, 1996;1997;Bj\u00f6rklund, Ginther, & Sundstr\u00f6m, 2005) and young adults (Bulduc, Caron, & Logue, 2007;Heard, 2007;Melby et al., 2008). For example, Heard (2007) used the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to examine the influence of family structure transitions on indicators of children's grade point average (GPA), youth's college expectations (e.g., likelihood youth would attend college), and adolescent school discipline (e.g., paying attention in school and trouble with teachers and other students). Using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models and logistic regression analysis, results showed adolescents in all non-two biological parent families have lower grades and less likely to expect to attend college (significant at p<.05 level) compared to adolescents in two-original biological parent families. While Heard (2007) findings support the knowledge that small GPA scores have a significant negative effect on college admissions, the limitation of the study is the large sample size (N=11,318) which allows relatively small coefficients to become statistically significant. Tillman (2008), following Heard's (2007) methodology, focused more specifically on stepfamilies, and revealed that children who experience family structure pathways (e.g., stepfamily formation after parental separation) on average, are at risk for poorer academic outcomes, such as lower GPAs and lower than average college expectation among youth. A key finding of this study is across the academic outcomes, the disadvantages of divorce/separation are particularly pronounced for youth who have transitioned into a cohabitating stepfamily or single-father family (Tillman, 2007). Ginther and Pollack (2004) investigated the correlation between family structure and children's educational outcomes using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79), the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and the NLSY-Child and Young Adult Survey. The authors examined the effect of stepfamilies structures on four schooling outcomes (years of schooling, high school graduation, college attendance, and college graduation) and the results showed educational outcomes of stepchildren and their half-siblings (i.e., the joint children of both parents), are similar to each other and yet, are substantially worse off than outcomes for children reared in traditional nuclear families. In general, children from stepfamilies do worse academically than kids from continuously married parent families (Ginther & Pollak, 2004). In terms of young adults, Bulduc, Caron, and Logue (2007) studied the impact parental divorce has on college-aged (over the age of 18) students, whose parents divorced after they left home and entered college. While this study used a college student cohort, the focus was the effect of divorce on the quality of relationship between the child and their parent as opposed to their educational success. The results showed many of the students responded that the divorce brought about a closer relationship with their mother and a more tense relationship with their father, and the divorce cause them particular problems around the holidays. Wallerstein and Lewis' (2004) research is one of the few to assess the effect of parental divorce on children's higher education. In their study, only 57% of children with divorced parents obtained their bachelor's degree as compared with 90% in the comparison group (Wallerstein & Lewis, 2004). The limitation of Wallerstein's work is the research subjects were recruited from her family therapy practice, who may already be at risk for poorer outcomes. Because of this limitation, these results should not be used to generalize all post-divorce families. In a study of Swedish families, Bj\u00f6rklund and Sundstr\u00f6m (2006) used a sibling-difference analysis (i.e., those whose parents separated and among whom at least one had turned 18 at the time of separation) to examine the association between parental separation during childhood and educational attainment as adults. The study used population registers at Statistics Sweden of citizens born between 1951 and 1963. The sibling cohorts were divided into two groups: siblings who reached age 18 before parental separation and sibling who reached age 18 after parental separation. Their initial results showed siblings who experienced a parental separation before age 18 had lower levels of educational attainment (e.g., the highest type of degree received, including graduate degrees) as adults compared to siblings who experienced a parental separation after age 18. However, in their family fixed-effects estimation model, which controls for the shared family characteristics of the full siblings, the authors found no statistically significant difference between full siblings who experienced/not experienced parental separation. A limitation of their study is their analysis was based on children in Sweden, where the educational systems are very different than the United States. Also, Swedish law does not distinguish between married and cohabitating couples. Accordingly, Bj\u00f6rklund, Ginther, and Sundstr\u00f6m (2007) used the same methodology to conduct a comparative study on a Swedish cohort and a United States cohort to understand the relationships between childhood family structure, schooling and earnings. Comparing the USA and Sweden is appealing because both family structure and public policy environment in the two countries differ significantly (Bjorklund, Ginther, & Sundstrom, 2007). The authors used the same dataset from the Bj\u00f6rklund and Sundstr\u00f6m (2006) article, and for the US cohort, the authors used the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth of 1979 (NLSY79) and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics of 1985 (PSID). Unlike the initial study, childhood family structures were measured by the proportion of childhood spent in five different family structures (e.g., both biological parents, single biological mother, biological mother married/cohabitating with stepfather, single biological father, biological father married/cohabitating with stepmother, or other) (Bjorklund, Ginther, & Sundstrom, 2007). The authors found similar results in both countries in that the non-intact family structure variables were negatively and significantly correlated with years of schooling. Yet when unobserved family characteristics were controlled, the family structure coefficients were no longer statistically significant in either the US or Sweden sample (Bjorklund, Ginther, & Sundstrom, 2007 (Adelman, 1999;Astin & Osequera, 2002;Burton & Ramist, 2001;Hezelett et al., 2001;Sackett et al., 2009;Zwick, 2007). These studies found a similar pattern of a small correlation between test scores and degree completion only when observing single college samples, and studies based on large national data sets found no correlation.  (Crosby & Moncarz, 2006;Fischer, 2013). Due to these reasons, the current study uses educational attainment, both enrollment and completion, to measure post-baccalaureate educational success."}, {"section_title": "Factors Associated with Post-Baccalaureate Educational Attainment", "text": "Several studies investigate how unemployment rate fluctuations, economic recessions, and the business cycle impact graduate education enrollment (Bedard & Herman, 2008;Dellas & Koubi, 2003;Sakellaris & Spilimbergo, 2000). For example, Bedard and Herman (2008)  showed the only statistically significant unemployment rate responses were for male Ph.D. and Master's enrollment (Bedard & Herman, 2008). Other characteristics of individuals who choose to attend graduate/professional schools have been examined, such as race, ethnicity, socio-economic status and gender (Black & Sufi, 2002;Mullen et al., 2003;Paulsen & St. John, 2002;Perna, 2000;Perna, 2004;Qian & Blair, 1999). For example, Perna (2004) used the 1997 follow up survey of the Baccalaureate and Beyond 1993 (B&B: 93/97) study to examine the gender and racial/ethnic differences of individuals who enroll in graduate programs. Even though the effect is small in size, the findings suggest women were more likely than men to enroll in master's level programs (23% versus 16%), yet were less likely to enroll in professional (5% versus 10%) or doctoral (2% versus 4%) level programs. In terms of racial/ethnic differences, Asians were more likely (16%) to enroll in a professional level program than all of the other racial/ethnic groups. When controlling for financial and academic resources (e.g., financial debt, amount of total loans borrowed, and family income) along with cultural and social capital, measured by parental educational attainment (e.g., higher level of education attained by either parent) and bilingual background; the results were unchanged for sex differences, yet for racial/ethnic differences, the results showed enrolling in either a master's or professional level program is higher for Blacks than for Whites. A few studies have examined the relationship between parent's education background and post-baccalaureate educational attainment of children (Ethington & Smart, 1986;Ermisch & Francesconi, 2001;Mullen, Goyette, & Soares, 2003;Perna, 2004;St. John & Wooden, 2005 (1980) and Stolzenberg (1994), who both suggested a person who continues with higher education becomes more removed from their social background. However, the relationship varied across graduate programs. For every one year increase in parent's (mother's and father's) educational background, the odds for enrollment in master's programs increased by 6%, professional programs increased by 16%, and doctoral programs increased by 20% (Mullen, Goyette, & Soares, 2003)."}, {"section_title": "Parental Educational Expectations and Children's Educational Success", "text": "An important variable associated with children's educational success, particularly elementary and secondary education, is parents' educational expectations for their children (Davis- Kean, 2005;Dika & Singh, 2002;Englund et al., 2004;Fan & Chen, 2001;Kim & Schnieder, 2005;Perna & Titus, 2005;Reynolds & Burge, 2008;Zhan, 2006). These studies generally measured parental educational expectations through how far the parent thought their child would go in school. In general, the results showed a strong positive relationship between parent's educational expectations and children's academic achievement (Davis-Kean, 2005;Englund et al., 2004;Fan & Chen, 2001;Kim & Schnieder, 2005;Zhan, 2006). Parental expectations are unique from other kinds of parental involvement since parental expectations are personal views, whereas parental involvement focuses on real behaviors, such as PTA attendance and assisting with their child's homework. It could be argued parents' views influence their behaviors; however, it is important to differentiate between these two concepts when studying their effects on children's educational success. Studies have not examined the association between parental educational expectations and post-baccalaureate educational attainment."}, {"section_title": "Social Capital, Parental Divorce, and Post-Baccalaureate Educational Attainment", "text": "Parents' human capital is often measured through maternal and paternal level of education, which provides a resource children can draw upon (Parcel, Dufur, & Zito, 2010). In their review, Parcel et al. (2010) demonstrated that a decade of research has shown a strong and consistent positive relationship between parent's educational background and children's educational outcomes. Another type of capital in families is social capital. According to Coleman (1988), social capital refers to the social relationships in children's lives which helps them access the benefits of their parent's human capital (i.e., parent's education), as well as, parental investment of resources in their children. Divorce is one of the most stressful times for both adults and children, and studies continue to show that divorce is associated with lower levels of well-being (Amato, 2010). Social capital is built through the stability and resilience of family relationships; thus divorce places a strain on social capital within families (Furstenberg, 2005). Social capital is strongly related to educational success, yet children's social capital can be affected by parental divorce. Three common measures of social capital are parental monitoring, parent-child relationship quality, and parent-school involvement. These have been shown to be strongly associated with children's educational success. Parental monitoring (e.g., parents' update of children's whereabouts and who children spend time with) tends to decrease in divorced families, due to the lack of an additional support by another parent (Anguiano, 2004). Parent-child relationship quality (e.g., warmth, closeness and interest) lessens due to divorce, with children being less motivated to participate in school (Dika & Singh, 2002;Turley, Desmond & Bruch, 2010). Parental involvement is positively linked to children educational success, however, parental involvement is lower due to the lack of parent-parent support among divorced families (Fan & Chen, 2001;Hill et al., 2004;Zhan, 2006). Coleman's (1988) social capital theory has been previously used to examine children's educational attainment. Dika and Singh (2002) conducted an extensive content analysis of the educational literature from three time periods (i.e., 1990-1995, 1996-1998, and 1999-2001) \"to explore the usage of social capital as an explanatory variable in educational research\" (p.31). Thirteen of the studies examined the relationship between social capital and educational attainment. Overall, \"social capital is positively associated with high school and college enrollment, with traditional family structure, parent's expectations and encouragement, and parentchild interactions are positively related to these two outcomes\" (p.41). Parent's educational background does have a positive relationship with the postbaccalaureate educational attainment of children (Ethington & Smart, 1986;Ermisch & Francesconi, 2001;Mullen, Goyette, & Soares, 2003;Perna, 2004;St. John & Wooden, 2005). However, parent's educational background provides an incomplete picture of children's educational success. Rather, the human capital possessed by the parents needs to be complemented by information about the social capital embodied in family relations (Coleman, 1988, p. S110). So, \"as a family maintains its stability, the more developed the group norms, expectations, and obligations, and thus, the higher level of social capital\u2026as such, families must cultivate their stability and subsequently, their social capital, to flourish and maintain their existence\" (Shriner, Mullis, and Schlee, 2009, p. 447). Therefore, using this theory we could find probable differences in the social capital for children with divorced versus non-divorced parents. In this study, I use parental expectations, in addition to parental divorce, as an indicator of social capital in families. While findings establish family structure as an important factor in children's educational success, no study has yet examined how parental divorce affects children's post-baccalaureate educational attainment. Unique to this study, I also examine whether and how parental educational expectations might mediate the relationship between parental divorce and children's post-baccalaureate educational attainment. In other words, do differences in parental educational expectations between divorced and non-divorced parents help explain differences in children's post-baccalaureate educational attainment? Specifically, I test the following four hypotheses below. Figure 1 outlines the theoretical models (Model A through D) used for the analyses in each hypothesis described below. Furthermore, all hypotheses will be tested controlling for characteristics of children (gender, race, and ethnicity), characteristics of parent (educational background), and characteristics of household (family income)."}, {"section_title": "Hypotheses", "text": "Hypothesis 1: Adult children whose parents have divorced will have lower postbaccalaureate educational attainment compared to those with continuously married biological parents (Model A). Hypothesis 2: Parent's educational expectations will be lower for children with divorced parents compared to children with continuously married biological parents (Model B). Hypothesis 3: Parental educational expectations will be positively related to children's postbaccalaureate education attainment (Model C). Hypothesis 4: Parental educational expectations will mediate the relationship between parental divorce and youth's post-baccalaureate educational attainment, such that the effect of parental divorce on youth's post-baccalaureate educational attainment will be explained in part or fully by lower parent's educational expectations among children with divorced parents (Model D)."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER III", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "This study is based on the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97). Produced by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, this survey provides data on demographic characteristics, labor market activity, event life history and schooling history features. Although similar to the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79), the NLSY97 provides corresponding data on a newer cohort of adolescents The NLSY97 also includes an oversample of African American and Latino persons (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2011), important given higher divorce rates among minorities (Teachman, Tedrow, & Hall, 2006) and a recent increase in college enrollment among these groups (Perna, 2000(Perna, , 2004. When weighted to reflect the demographic characteristics of the U.S. population, the NLSY97 provides a representative sample of youth. The NLSY97 respondents were born between 1980 and 1984. At the time of the first interview, respondent's ages ranged from 12 to 18. Round 1 of the survey took place in 1997. In that round, both the eligible youth and one of that youth's parents received hour-long personal interviews. In addition, an extensive two-part questionnaire was administered to both youth and parent which gathered demographic information on every member of the youth's household and on immediate family members living elsewhere. The youth, but not their parents, continue to be interviewed on an annual basis. This study is based on youth who completed the most recent data fielded in 2011-2012 (Round 15 of the survey). The number of respondents in Round 1 of the survey were 8,984 individuals, comprised of 4,599 (51%) males and 4,385 (49%) females. The retention rate of the survey has been excellent. Eighty-three percent of the Round 1 sample were interviewed in the most recent round (National Longitudinal Surveys, 2014). The NLSY97 is well-suited for the present study in that its main goal was to document the transition from school to work in young adulthood. Therefore, extensive information was collected on the youth questionnaire about respondents' educational experiences over time.  Unfortunately, the current cohort data is unavailable for public-use at this time, and the study does not provide detailed family background history variables needed for this study (i.e., parental divorce). Add Health, a nationally representative survey conducted in four waves from 1994-2008, contained extensive family background variables and schooling history of children, however, the participants of Add Health were not of the age range desired for this particular study."}, {"section_title": "Analytic Sample", "text": "In this study, the analytic sample was comprised of respondents who completed Round 15 of the survey, when respondents were between the ages of 26 to 32 (N=8,984). The sample was limited to youth whose parent questionnaire was filled out by a biological parent, either the biological mother or the biological father (N=8,300). Therefore, youth whose parent questionnaire was filled-out by an adoptive, step, foster, guardian or non-relative parent were removed from the sample (8%). The sample was further limited to youth who were born within a marriage (N=5,856). Thus, youths born outside of marriage were removed from the sample (27%). The assumption was made that if a child born within a marriage, that youth was the product of that marriage. The analytic sample was further limited to include (a) youth whose biological parents' marriage ended in legal divorce, and (b) youth whose biological parents' marriage remained intact. Parents whose marriage ended in either physical separation, legal separation (but not divorced) or widowed were removed from the sample (11%). The analytic sample is comprised of 4,855 youth between the ages 26 to 32 at Round 15 of the survey, conducted in 2011-2012 (Sample 1). Analyses pertaining to parental educational expectations had to be limited to a subsample of NLSY97 youth because only parents of youth between the ages of 15 and 18 at Round 1 were asked about their expectations for their child's education (i.e., parents of children age 12-14 were not included). The sample size for analyses dealing with educational expectations was, therefore, limited to 1,853 youths (Sample 2). The frequency distribution of both Sample 1 and Sample 2 can be found in Table 1."}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Dependent Variables", "text": "Post-baccalaureate educational attainment Post-baccalaureate educational attainment were measured through the combination of variables, using information collected at each round on college enrollment status and information on the highest degree earned assessed at Round 15 of the survey. At each round, the youth was asked \"current college enrollment status as of the survey year\". The NLSY97 categories included (1) not enrolled, no high school degree, no GED (2) not enrolled, GED (3) not enrolled, high school degree (4) not enrolled, some college (5) not enrolled, 2-year college graduate (6) not enrolled, 4-year college graduate (7) not enrolled, graduate degree (8) enrolled in grades 1-12, not a high school graduate (9) enrolled in a 2-year college 10enrolled in a 4-year college and (11) enrolled in a graduate program. Post-baccalaureate educational attainment was assessed at Round 15 of the survey, the most recent survey year. At Round 15, youth was asked \"what is the highest degree respondent has received ever?\" The response categories included (0) none (1) GED (2) high school diploma (3) associate/junior college (AA) 4 The first is a dichotomous measure of post-baccalaureate educational attainment, coded as '1' if the youth obtained a graduate degree or was ever enrolled in a graduate program (Masters, Ph.D., DDS, MD, JD). Youth were coded as '0' if they obtained a bachelor's degree or less or ever enrolled in less than a four-year degree program (Bachelors, AA, GED). This category served as the reference group in the analysis. A second dichotomous measure of post-baccalaureate educational attainment was limited to youth who had obtained a graduate degree and, therefore, did not include ever enrolled in a graduate program. Not having obtained a graduate degree served as the reference group in the analysis. A third dichotomous measure of baccalaureate educational attainment was created in which was a youth obtained a four-year degree or greater. Less than a bachelor's degree served as the reference group in the analysis."}, {"section_title": "Independent Variables", "text": "Parental Divorce. Parental divorce was the focus of this study and was measured using a combination of several variables. For children whose parents divorced prior to Round 1, parental divorce was gleaned from the parent's Round 1 questionnaire. At Round 1, the responding parent (generally the biological mother) were asked \"is parent currently married, separated, divorced or widowed\". If the condition applied, the responding parent answered \"in what month and year did you marry [this spouse/partner]\", for up to six spouses. Second, the responding parent were asked \"is parent currently separated, divorced, and widowed from spouse?\" If condition applied, the parent respondent were asked \"how did the marriage to spouse(s) end\"? The resulting categories included (1) legal separation only (2) physical separation but no legal separation (3) divorce and (1) high school or less (K-12 th grade/Diploma or GED) (2) some college (1 st -2 nd year of college/associate's degree) (3) four-year college degree (3 rd -4 th year of college/bachelor's degree) and (4) graduate/professional degree (5 th year of college or more). A set of dummy variables was created for each category of education for both mothers and fathers, with graduate degree serving as the reference category. Characteristics of the Household. Household income for the most recent year was reported by the child's parents at Round 1. The NLSY97 defined income as gross wage/salary for respondent, along with data on other income sources (rental property, small business investments, inheritance, child support, annuities, etc.) (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2014). To reduce the proportion of missing data, respondents who do not provide exact dollar answers were asked to select the applicable category from a predefined list of ranges. Based on these predefined ranges, I created variables based on income quartiles (1) low (less than or equal to $23,100) (2) medium (less than or equal to $51,400) and (3) high (less than or equal to $246,500), with high income serving as the reference category."}, {"section_title": "Analytic Strategy", "text": "Results presented in the following chapter are based on the analysis plan described below. First, descriptive weighted statistics pertaining to the two analytic samples used in the analysis are presented. This information details the sample, percentages, and standard deviations of the dependent variables, independent variables and control variables outlined in the preceding Measures section. Second, bivariate relationships were assessed using chi-square tests (weighted), which assessed whether a statistically significant relationship is present between parental divorce, parental educational expectations, control variables, and youth's post-baccalaureate educational attainment of both analytic samples. Third, multivariate relationships were assessed using logistic regression, which is appropriate for categorical dependent variables. The use of logistic regressions converts categorical dependent variables' non-linear relationship into a linear one (DeMaris, 1995). In this series of analyses, post-baccalaureate educational attainment was regressed on parental divorce and parental educational expectations while controlling for youth gender and ethnicity, parents' educational background and household income. Various strategies were used to measure post-baccalaureate educational attainment.  With respect to family structure, in Sample 1, 41% of youth had divorced parents compared to 59% of youth who had both biological parents remain married. In Sample 2, 43% of youth had divorced parents compared to 57% of youth who had both biological parents remain married."}, {"section_title": "Description of the Sample", "text": "The educational expectations of a parent were limited to youth who were 15 to 18 years old at the time of Round 1. Approximately 66% of parents had high expectations (71 -100% chance) that their child would obtain a college degree by the time they turned 30, compared to 33% of parents who had low expectations (0 -70% chance) of their children obtaining a college degree. In both samples, more than three-fourths of the sample were youth of Caucasian ethnicity. Approximately 12% of youth were Hispanic, 8% of youth were Black, and less than 1% were Non-Caucasian/Non-Hispanic. The gender of youth was closely divided in half with 51% male and 49% female, in both samples. In both samples, the youth's parents' educational background indicated the majority of parents (mothers and fathers), had a high school education or less. Approximately 25% of the youths' mothers had some college education compared to 19% of the youth's fathers. Both mothers and fathers had low percentages in terms of college or graduate education. In both samples, approximately 14% of mothers and 8% of fathers who had divorced had a bachelor's degree compared to 19% of mothers and 20% of fathers who had remained continuously married. Approximately 9% of mothers and 8% of fathers who had divorced had a graduate degree compared to 12% of mothers and 16% of fathers who remained continuously married. In terms of household income, only about 14% of households were in the lowest third (less than or equal to $23,100). Approximately 44% of the households were in the middle third (less than or equal to $51,400) and 42% of the households were in the highest third (less than or equal to $246,500). Table 2 shows the relationship between youth's family structure and their postbaccalaureate educational attainment in Sample 1 (youth age 12 to 18 at Round 1). Many significant differences emerge between youth with divorced biological parents and youth with continuously married biological parents. A much higher proportion of youth with parents who remained married attained a graduate degree or were enrolled in a graduate program (20%) compared to youth with divorced parents (12%). When looking at those youths who obtained only a graduate degree, nearly twice as many youths with parents who remained married obtained a graduate degree (12%) compared to youth with divorced parents (7%). A significantly lower percentage of youth with divorced parents had a bachelor's degree (27%) than youth with parents who remained continuously married (50%)."}, {"section_title": "Bivariate Analysis", "text": "In terms of youth's race and ethnicity, the percentage of White, Hispanic, and Other youths were relatively similar for youth with divorce parents versus youth with continuously married parents.

This compares to 10% of youth of divorced parents who were Hispanic compared to 13% of youth with continuously married parents who were Hispanic. In terms of parental educational background, the percentage of parents' with high school education or less and some college was relatively similar for parents' who had ever divorced versus parents' who remained continuously married. One prominent contrast was the percentage of divorced mothers with a bachelor's (14%) or a graduate (8%) degree compared to the percentages of continuously married mothers with a bachelor's (19%) or a graduate (13%) degree. This compares to 8% of divorced fathers with a bachelor's or graduate degree compared to 18% of continuously married fathers with a bachelor's degree and 17% with a graduate degree. In terms of parental educational expectations, the percentages were notably different between divorced parents and continuously married parents. The percentage of divorced parents with low (0 -70%) expectations for their child was 40% compared to 30% of continuously married parents with low expectations. This compares to 60% of divorced parents with high (71 -100%) expectations for their child compared to 70% of continuously married parents with high expectations.

I found support that parental divorce is significantly related to youth's post-baccalaureate educational enrollment and attainment through the use of three separate analyses (see Tables 4 through 7). In the first analysis, using Sample 1 (youth age 12 to 18 at Round 1), results showed that there was a significant negative relationship between parental divorce ever and youth's postbaccalaureate educational attainment (all three measures) both with and without the control variables in the model (Table 4 and Table 5). The odds of adult children with divorced parents who attained a graduate degree and/or had ever been enrolled in a graduate program were 30% less than those of adult children with continuously married parents. The odds of adult children with divorced parents who obtained a bachelor's degree and higher were 44% less than those of adult children with continuously married parents. A supplemental analysis was conducted to determine whether the age of the child at the time of the parents' divorce had an influence on his or her post-baccalaureate educational attainment (Table 7). This analysis was limited to children with divorced parents (N=1,763). In this analysis, I regressed youth's post-baccalaureate educational attainment on a variable indicating those whose parents' divorce occurred prior to Round 1 (when the youth was between the ages 12 to 18) versus youths whose parents' divorce occurred after Round 1 (when the youth was age 18 and older). Results showed a significant negative relationship between parental divorce post-Round 1 and youth's post-baccalaureate educational attainment, for all three measures without control variables (Table 6). However, once control variables were included in the analysis (Table   7) the effect was only significant for youth obtaining a bachelor's degree and higher.  (Table 8). However, when control variables were added to this analysis, the significant relationship between parental divorce ever and youth obtaining a graduate degree or enrolling in a graduate program disappeared (Table 9). This indicates that, for this groups of older children at Round 1, the youth's gender, ethnicity, and parents' education explains the negative effect of parental divorce on post-baccalaureate educational attainment. There was a significant positive relationship between parental divorce ever and whether or not the youth obtained a bachelor's degree and higher. The odds of adult children with divorced parents obtaining a bachelor's degree or higher is 47% less compared adult children with continuously married parents obtaining a bachelor's degree or higher."}, {"section_title": "Relationship between parental educational expectations and parental divorce", "text": "Using the sample of children age 15 to 18 at Round 1 (Sample 2), I examined the association between parental divorce and parental educational expectations (Hypothesis 2) by regressing parental expectations, the continuous variable measure (0 to 100%), on parental divorce. I did not find support for Hypothesis 2, which stated that the parents of adult children who had divorced would have lower educational expectations for their child compared to continuously married parents. There was not a statistically significant association between parental divorce and parental educational expectations (Table 10 and  parental divorce and parental educational expectations, with and without control variables (Tables   14 and 15). Without controls, parental divorce and parental educational expectations had a statistically significant effect on the odds of attaining a graduate degree or ever enrolling in a graduate program. However, when the controls were added into the models, the effect of parental divorce did not remain statistically significant for youth attaining a graduate degree, but only remained of youth attaining a bachelor's degree and higher. The odds of youth with divorced parents obtaining a bachelor's degree and higher is 51% less than youth with continuously married parents obtaining a bachelor's degree and higher. With respect to parental educational expectations, when controls were added into the models, the effect of parental educational expectations remained statistically significant for all three measures. The odds of youth with high parental educational expectations attained a graduate degree or ever enrolled in a graduate program 38% higher than youth with low educational expectations. Moreover, youth with high parental educational expectations obtained a graduate degree 35% higher than youth with low parental educational expectations. Furthermore, youth with high parental educational expectation obtained a bachelor's degree and beyond 34% higher than youth with low parental educational expectations. To determine if parental educational expectations mediates the relationship between parental divorce and youth's post-baccalaureate educational attainment (Hypothesis 4), the coefficient for parental divorce in each of the models with controls (Table 15) was compared to the coefficients in Table 9, in which post-baccalaureate educational attainment is regressed on parental divorce (without parental educational expectations in the model). Comparisons of theses coefficients across models showed no change in size or significance indicating that lower parental educational expectation among children with divorced parents does not explain the negative effects of parental divorce. However, regardless of parental educational expectations and socio-demographic controls, parental divorce was negatively associated with the odds of obtaining a bachelor's degree in young adulthood. CHAPTER 5"}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION", "text": "Possessing a graduate degree is becoming increasingly important to one's economic success. Previous research has consistently shown that family relationships have an influence on children's educational outcomes (Ethington & Smart, 1986;Ermisch & Francesconi, 2001;Mullen, Goyette, & Soares, 2003;Perna, 2004;St. John & Wooden, 2005). Social capital is strongly related to educational success, yet children's social capital can be affected by parental divorce. The most common measures of social capital (i.e., parental monitoring, parent-child relationship quality, and parent-school involvement) tie into the educational expectations a parent has for their child. The time a parent would be able to spend with the child either academically (e.g., parent-teacher association participation), socially (e.g., knowing who the child's friends are), or personally (e.g., family dinners or parent-child activities) tends to decrease when the parent is going through a divorce. The difficulties associated with solo parenting, decline in emotional support, economic hardship, and other stressful life events are often associated with divorce (Amato, 2000). Therefore, time and resources of the parent is stretched thin which could contribute to lower educational expectations for their children. On one hand, results showed that parental divorce, in addition to parental educational expectations, did not have an influence on children's post-baccalaureate educational attainment. With respect to parental educational expectations, there was no significant difference between the expectations of parents' who divorced and the expectations of continuously married parents. Moreover, high parental educational expectations were significantly positively associated with children's post-baccalaureate educational attainment. On the other hand, results showed adult children from divorced parental families had lower post-baccalaureate educational attainment compared to those from continuously married biological parent families. In the United States, estimates indicate that about half of marriages will end in divorce, and half of American children will experience their parents' divorce before the age of 18 (Amato, 2000;Copen et al., 2012). The divorce literature has been dedicated to understanding the effect of parental divorce on children's educational success. Research has found that children who experienced parental divorce are at risk for a variety of negative outcomes (Amato, 2010;Cherlin et al., 1991;Lansford, 2009). An important variable associated with children's educational success, particularly elementary and secondary education, is parental educational expectations (Davis- Kean, 2005;Dika & Singh, 2002;Englund et al., 2004;Fan & Chen, 2001;Kim & Schnieder, 2005;Perna & Titus, 2005;Reynolds & Burge, 2008;Zhan, 2006). The results showed an overwhelming strong positive relationship between parent's educational expectations and children's academic achievement (Davis-Kean, 2005;Englund et al., 2004;Fan & Chen, 2001;Kim & Schnieder, 2005;Zhan, 2006). Divorce is one of the most stressful times for both adults and children, and studies continue to show that divorce is associated with lower levels of well-being (Amato, 2010). Social capital is built through the stability and resilience of family relationships; thus divorce places a strain on social capital within families (Furstenberg, 2005). However, the effect of parental divorce and parent's educational expectations on adult children's educational success has been limited, particularly adult children's post-baccalaureate educational attainment. Social capital develops within relationships between parents and children. When those relationships are put to strain, such as parents getting divorced, general indicators of social capital (i.e., parental educational expectations) the size of their effects on a child should diminish. The finding that parental educational expectations did not mediate the effect of parental divorce on children's post-baccalaureate educational attainment when obtaining a graduate degree or enrolling in a graduate degree program, did not support this hypothesis. A possible conclusion can be drawn from this finding. Because social capital theory suggests that parents that have been divorced may invest less time with their children, and may possess lower expectations of their success, they may have fewer resources to ensure their child succeeds in education. Social capital theory (Coleman, 1988) emphasizes that parent's greater financial and human capital is passed on within the parentchild relationship to influence the children's future educational success. However, as this study shows, regardless of the human capital side (i.e., parent educational background and income) divorce is still associated with lower higher educational success of children, but a parent's educational expectations for their child does not differ whether or not the parents have been divorced. This study has several important limitations. One is the sole focus on parental divorce, which excludes other prevalent nontraditional family structures. This is problematic because studies have showed that alternative, non-traditional family structures, such as co-habiting, homosexual coupling, and stepfamilies, are continuing to grow (Dorius, 2015). However, since research on the effect of family structures on children's post-baccalaureate educational attainment is relatively new, and the specific effect of parental divorce is not fully understood, the present study is important in establishing a base-line that can be drawn upon for future research. Another limitation of this study was that parental educational expectations were only assessed for older youth (those who were age 15 to 18 at Round 1). Therefore, it is unknown whether results would apply to broader age range of children. Moreover, this variable only applied to the parent's expectations of their child earning a four-year degree by they turned 30. As such, the variable was not able to measure expectations for graduate-level educational attainment. The measure was still useful to understand the mediating effect between parental divorce and children's higher educational success because if a parent has either high or low expectations of their child obtaining a bachelor's degree, it could be assumed those expectations translate into educational expectations for degree attainment post-bachelors.
