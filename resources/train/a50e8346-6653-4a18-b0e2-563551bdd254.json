APOE-\u03b54 is associated with AD-related biological and clinical markers including cortical amyloid-b (Ab) plaque burden, hippocampal atrophy [3] [4] [5] , and accelerated cognitive decline in healthy aging [6] [7] [8] . However, there have been conflicting/mixed findings with some reporting that APOE-\u03b54 is not associated with hippocampal volume [9, 10] or cognitive decline in healthy aging [9, 10] or with risk of converting from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD [11, 12] . These inconsistencies may be due to the potentially critical modulating role of sex in the association between APOE-\u03b54 and AD.\nEarly cross-sectional studies indicated that APOE-\u03b54 confers a greater risk for AD in women than in men [13] [14] [15] . These early findings are supported by a longitudinal study [16] and a meta-analysis that reported an increased risk of incident AD in female APOE-\u03b54 heterozygotes versus male heterozygotes among adults aged 65 to 75 years [17] . Among older normal controls, the adverse effect of APOE-\u03b54 on AD biomarkers including cerebrospinal fluid total tau levels [18] , brain metabolism [19] , cortical thinning [19] , and functional brain connectivity in the default mode network [18] was stronger in women versus men, although not consistently [19, 20] . In MCI, the effect of APOE-\u03b54 on brain atrophy [21] , total tau levels [16] , and the tau/Ab ratio [16] was stronger in women versus men. To our knowledge, only one study examined sex differences in the effects of APOE-\u03b54 in AD patients and reported a stronger association between APOE-\u03b54 and Ab burden in parietal, cingulate, and frontal regions in men versus women [22] , suggesting a possible reversal in the moderating role of sex on APOE-\u03b54 in the MCI-to-AD transition that warrants further exploration. Surprisingly, few studies have examined the interactive effects of sex and APOE-\u03b54 on cognitive performance [21, 23, 24] , particularly verbal memory, even though verbal memory is the cognitive domain that shows the earliest and most severe deficits in AD [25] . Among community-dwelling older adults, the association between APOE-\u03b54 and accelerated cognitive decline, as measured by a global cognitive measure, was stronger in women versus men [23, 24] . In a MCI sample, female heterozygous or homozygous APOE-\u03b54 carriers showed worse performance on a delayed (5 minute) word recall task from the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale compared with female noncarriers, whereas the APOE-\u03b54 effect was only evident in homozygous men [21] . In addition, few studies have examined the sex by APOE interaction across the AD continuum [22] despite evidence of a temporal ordering of AD markers, whereby Ab deposition occurs first, followed by neurodegenerative biomarkers and cognitive impairment [26, 27] . We systematically examined the separate and interactive effects of sex and APOE on multiple AD-related markers including Ab deposition, hippocampal volume, brain glucose metabolism, and verbal memory performance in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Effects were examined in each disease stage (NC, MCI, AD), in which MCI versus NC was defined using the Jak/Bondi diagnostic method, an actuarial, neuropsychological diagnostic approach that has produced more discernible cognitive phenotypes, more stable diagnoses, stronger associations with AD biomarkers, and better predication of progression to dementia than conventional diagnostic criteria [28, 29] . Consistent with the broader literature, we predicted that the adverse effects of APOE-\u03b54 would be stronger in women versus men, and in-line with the temporal sequence of AD-related markers [26, 27] , this sex difference in the APOE-\u03b54 effect will manifest at the NC stage for earlier AD events (Ab deposition) and in MCI for later events (hippocampal atrophy, brain hypometabolism, and memory deficits)."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants and data source", "text": "Data were extracted from the ADNI database (adni.loni. usc.edu).

We extend previous findings by performing the following: (1) comparing these sex differences across biomarker and clinical outcomes; (2) identifying changes in sex differences that occur across disease stages; and (3) by defining MCI using an algorithmic, neuropsychological diagnostic criteria that have shown better prognostic value in terms of progression to dementia than more conventional criteria. Our novel findings are that sex differences in APOE-\u03b54 effects on AD-related markers varied by marker and disease stage and that the effect of APOE-\u03b54 on brain structure/function manifested at a later disease stage in women versus men.\nConsistent with previous findings, we found that AV45 SUVR was higher in NC women versus NC men regardless of APOE genotype. We also replicated the well-evidenced finding that women outperform men in verbal memory and indicated that this difference is regardless of APOE genotype. The dichotomy of better verbal memory performance and greater Ab pathology in NC women versus NC men suggests that women may be better equipped to compensate for disease pathology and maintain normal verbal memory performance. Consistent with some past reports [37] [38] [39] [40] , we also found that NC women had a larger HpVR and a higher FDG SUVR than NC men possibly because of hormonal factors associated with female sex, such as the organization and activation effects of estrogen on the brain. A larger and a more efficient neural network in the brain region that regulates verbal memory may serve as a \"brain reserve\" [41, 42] association between APOE-\u03b54 and lower HpVR and FDG SUVR in men only. The association between APOE and brain structure/function in healthy aging has been controversial with some, but not all, studies reporting an association [19, [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . Neglecting APOE by sex interactive effects on brain structure/function could be a contributing factor to discordant results. The sex differences in FDG SUVR, Ab deposition, and HpVR (after adjusting for covariates) observed in NC were absent in MCI; however, women were able to sustain their verbal memory advantage over men in MCI despite poorer AVLT scores in MCI versus NC. In contrast to the NC group, the adverse effects of APOE-\u03b54 on HpVR and FDG SUVR were observed in MCI women in addition to MCI men. Findings suggest that whereas APOE-34 effects on brain structure/function manifest in men during normal cognitive aging or preclinical AD, effects do not manifest in women until MCI. Perhaps, in the MCI stage, the pathophysiological brain changes have reached a threshold of severity past which compensatory mechanisms are overwhelmed in women and the adverse effect of APOE-\u03b54 on verbal memory is exposed. Conversely, the adverse effect of APOE-\u03b54 on higher amyloid deposition was observed across sex in both NC and MCI possibly because of the hypothesized temporal evolution of AD biomarkers whereby Ab deposition occurs before changes in brain structure and functional changes and up to a decade before clinical deficits [48] .\nIn AD, overall sex differences included a larger HpVR and the continued female advantage in verbal memory advantage in women versus men although the sex difference in AVLT scores was much smaller than that observed in the NC and MCI groups suggesting that the advantage is attenuated with increasing disease severity. APOE-\u03b54 related to smaller HpVR and greater Ab deposition but not FDG SUVR or verbal memory in AD suggesting that the effects of the disease at this advanced stage overwhelm APOE-\u03b54 effects on brain function and verbal memory. There was a sex by APOE interaction on AV45 SUVR in AD whereby APOE-\u03b54 related to AV45 SUVR in men only. As shown in Figs. 2C and 3C , the manifestation of this interaction in AD but not in MCI resulted from greater Ab deposition in female APOE-\u03b54 noncarriers in AD versus MCI so that Ab deposition was similarly high in female carriers and noncarriers with AD. Conversely, male noncarriers had similar Ab deposition levels in MCI and AD. Similarly, Tosun et al. [22] reported a sex by APOE interaction on Ab deposition that was driven by lower Ab deposition in male APOE-\u03b54 noncarriers versus carriers and similarly high levels in female carriers and noncarriers. An increase in Ab deposition in female noncarriers in the MCI-to-AD transition requires investigation in longitudinal studies and, if found, would challenge theories that Ab deposition plateaus before AD diagnosis in women [48] .\nOur results are in contrast to some previous reports of a stronger APOE effect in women versus men on AD-related outcomes in healthy aging and on cognitive function in MCI. Discrepant findings may result from multiple contributing factors. Mixed race/ethnicity groups in prior studies may have introduced bias from population stratification that can complicate interpretation of genetic data. Race differences have been reported in the effects of APOE-\u03b54 on cognitive decline [49] . Studies may also have differed in the age of study samples and the specific biomarkers (e.g., cortical thickness vs. ROI-based volumetry) or cognitive outcomes examined. Many studies examined a global cognitive measure, whereas we specifically examined verbal memory, a clinical marker more reflective of AD risk. The female advantage on verbal memory may influence the effect of APOE on verbal memory. Differences in diagnostic criteria might also contribute to discrepant findings. We used the Jak/Bondi criteria, an actuarial neuropsychological diagnostic approach that eliminates use of rating scales, global cognitive screens, and subjective cognitive complaints that are commonly used in conventional diagnostic methods. When comparing Jak/Bondi and conventional criteria, conventional MCI diagnostic methods resulted in about 33% false-positive and 7% false-negative error rates [28, 29, 50] . In support of the Jak/Bondi criteria, the \"false-positive\" subgroup performed within normal limits across the cognitive battery and showed cerebrospinal fluid biomarker levels, cortical thickness maps, and rates of progression to dementia that were comparable to a robust NC group [28, 29, 51] . The \"false-negative\" group showed cerebrospinal fluid biomarker levels that were comparable to the MCI group and progressed to dementia at double the rate of the overall NC sample [50] . These diagnostic errors resulting from conventional diagnoses may have skewed results of prior studies of sex by APOE interactive effects within NC or MCI.\nOur study has limitations. Our cross-sectional design precluded us from comparing rates of biomarker progression and memory decline by sex and APOE-\u03b54 status. Our differing and, at times, small sample sizes for each marker and diagnostic group may have led to varying and limited degrees of statistical power; however, we were able to detect a significant sex by APOE interaction in the smallest sample (AD patients with AV45 SUVR data). Our statistical power was too limited for significant findings to survive a multiple comparison correction; however, we sought to minimize comparisons by conducting sex-stratified analyses only in the presence of a significant sex by APOE-\u03b54 interaction. The risk for type 1 error should be considered when interpreting results. Our low number of APOE-\u03b54 homozygotes prohibited us from examining the additive effects of APOE-\u03b54 (noncarriers vs. heterozygotes vs. homozygotes). Finally, ADNI participants represent a convenience sample of volunteers who are predominantly Caucasian and well educated, which limits generalizability of results.\nA study strength was our examination of the sex by APOE interaction across disease stages and across clinical and biological AD-related markers. Comparing results among diagnostic groups enabled us to discern a pattern of effects whereby the adverse effect of APOE-\u03b54 on brain structure/function manifests in NC men but not until clinical disease stages in women. We also revealed important sex differences in AD-related markers regardless of APOE-\u03b54 status. The female advantage in verbal memory in conjunction with higher greater Ab pathology in NC women versus NC men suggests that women may be better equipped to compensate for disease pathology and maintain their verbal memory advantage.\nAPOE-\u03b54 status is a common selection criterion for intervention trials in preclinical AD. Considering that men and women may differ in the strength and trajectory of APOE-\u03b54 effects, failure to account for sex differences in APOE-\u03b54 effects on study outcomes could complicate interpretation of trials. Our findings may help to explain inconsistencies in the literature regarding APOE-\u03b54 effects on AD-related markers, particularly during the preclinical phase, and offer insight into biological mechanisms underlying sex differences in APOE-\u03b54-associated AD risk. genotype may confer a greater risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in women than in men. We are the first to examine the moderating role of sex on the effects of APOE-\u03b54 on multiple AD-related markers at all disease stages.\n2. Interpretation: Sex differences in the adverse effect of APOE-\u03b54 varied by AD-related marker and disease stage. Effects of APOE-\u03b54 on hippocampal volume and brain metabolism manifested in normal control men, whereas these effects did not manifest in women until mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In AD dementia, APOE-\u03b54 related to greater amyloid-b burden in men only.\n3. Future directions: APOE-\u03b54 status is a common selection criterion for intervention trials in preclinical AD. Considering that the strength and trajectory of APOE-\u03b54 effects differ in men and women, failure to account for sex differences in APOE-\u03b54 effects could complicate interpretation of trial findings."}]
