[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The impact of sea level rise on increased tidal flooding and storm surges in the Hampton Roads region is demonstrated, using~90 years of water level measurements in Norfolk, Virginia. Impacts from offshore storms and variations in the Gulf Stream (GS) are discussed as well, in view of recent studies that show that weakening in the flow of the GS (daily, interannually, or decadal) is often related to elevated water levels along the U.S. East Coast. Two types of impacts from hurricanes on flooding in Hampton Roads are demonstrated here. One type is when a hurricane like Isabel (2003) makes a landfall and passes near the Chesapeake Bay, causing a large but short-term (hours to a day) storm surge. The second type is when Atlantic hurricanes like Joaquin (2015) or Matthew (2016) stay offshore for a relatively long time, disrupting the flow of the GS and leading to a longer period (several days or more) of higher water levels and tidal flooding. Analysis of the statistics of tropical storms and hurricanes since the 1970s shows that, since the 1990s, there is an increase in the number of days when intense hurricanes (Categories 3-5) are found in the subtropical western North Atlantic. The observed Florida Current transport since the 1980s often shows less transport and elevated water levels when tropical storms and hurricanes pass near the GS. Better understanding of the remote influence of the GS and offshore storms will improve future prediction of flooding and help mitigation and adaptation efforts."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "T", "text": "he National Water Level Observation Network (NWLON) operated by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (https:// tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/nwlon. html) provides an essential source of data to study both long-term sea level rise (SLR) and short-term water level variations and storm surges. These tide gauges data show that the rate of local SLR along some stretches of the U.S. East Coast (around the C h e s a p e a k e B a y a n d t h e M i dAtlantic coast in particular) is much faster than the global SLR; this is mostly due to land subsidence (Boon, 2012; Mitchell et al., 2013; Ezer & Atkinson, 2015; Karegar et al., 2017) , with a potential recent acceleration in SLR due to climatic slowdown of ocean circulation (Boon, 2012; Sallenger et al., 2012; Ezer & Corlett, 2012) . Variations in wind patterns and atmospheric pressure (affecting sea level through the inverted barometer effect) can significantly contribute to coastal sea level variability along the U.S. East Coast (Piecuch et al., 2016; Woodworth et al., 2016) , but these effects are outside the scope of this study.\nNorfolk, VA, on the southern side of the Chesapeake Bay (see Figure 1 for its location), is a city that is already battling an acceleration in flooding frequency and intensity (Ezer & Atkinson, 2014 , 2015 Sweet & Park, 2014) . This study will focus on this city as an example that can apply to other coastal cities and communities in the Hampton Roads area, where efforts toward the development of options for adaptation, mitigation, and resilience to SLR have already been started (Considine et al., 2017; Yusuf & St. John, 2017) . Local SLR in Norfolk from~90 years of tide gauge records is~4.6 mm/year (Ezer, 2013) , but the rate is increasing (i.e., SLR is accelerating), so that the SLR over the last 30 years is~5.9 mm/ year compared to~3.5 mm/year in the previous 30 years (Ezer & Atkinson, 2015) ; the recent local SLR is significantly larger than the global SLR obtained from satellite altimeter data, 3.2 mm/year (Ezer, 2013) . SLR can also escalate the damage from hurricanes, tropical storms, and nor'easters. When high sea level today is added to storm surges, weaker storms today would cause as much flooding as much stronger past storms that happened when sea level was lower; this effect will be demonstrated here. There are some indications that warmer ocean waters may be related to an increase in the potential destructiveness of Atlantic hurricanes and tropical storms over the past 30 years (Emanuel, 2005) . However, with strong interannual and decadal variability, finding a persistent trend in storm activities over the past century or predicting future changes in hurricane activities over the next century are challenging (Knutson & Tuleya, 2004; Vecchi & Knutson, 2008; Bender et al., 2010) . Despite the difficulty of predicting the changes in the frequency and intensity of future storms, assessing the impact of SLR on storm surge is quite straightforward-if a storm with the same intensity and track that hit Norfolk 90 years ago were to come today, water level of a storm surge would be expected to be~40 cm higher, and many more streets would be flooded. In addition to the impact of storm surges, Atlantic storms can also have an indirect impact on the coast by modifying ocean currents and causing more mixing. If such storms affect the Gulf Stream (GS), coastal sea level could be affected as well (Ezer & Atkinson, 2014 , 2017 , and this indirect impact will be further investigated here. An additional indirect impact on coastal water level and coastal erosion is due to large swell from remote storms that can create wave runup (Dean et al., 2005) . Impact from wave runup can, for example, increase coastal erosion of barrier islands and coasts along the Atlantic Ocean (Haluska, 2017) . However, flooding in the Hampton Roads is not affected that much by waves and is mostly due to high water levels in the Chesapeake Bay and rivers (e.g., the Elizabeth River and the Lafayette River cause flooding in Norfolk).\nThe connection between the flow of the GS and sea level along the U.S. East Coast has been recognized early on from observations (Blaha, 1984) and models (Ezer, 2001) , though due to the relatively short observed record of the GS identifying a persistent long-term trend in the GS transport is challenging (Ezer, 2015) . Somewhat surprisingly, however, is the fact that this connection may be detected on a wide range of scales. On long-term decadal variability scales, for example, a potential climate-related slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) (Sallenger et al., 2012; McCarthy et al., 2012; Ezer et al., 2013; Ezer, 2013 Ezer, , 2015 Smeed et al., 2013; Srokosz & Bryden, 2015) may relate to accelerated SLR and increased risk of flooding along the U.S. East Coast (Boon, 2012; Ezer & Corlett, 2012; Sallenger et al., 2012; Mitchell et al., 2013; Yin & Goddard, 2013; Goddard et al., 2015; Ezer & Atkinson, 2014 , 2015 Sweet & Park, 2014) . On short-term time scales, there is now more evidence from data and models that even daily variations in the GS can cause variations in coastal sea level (Park & Sweet, 2015; Ezer, 2016; Wdowinski et al., 2016) , including unexpected \"clear-day\" flooding (i.e., unusual tidal flooding with no apparent storm or local weather events). These variations in the GS can be due to natural variability and instability (Baringer & Larsen, 2001; Meinen et al., 2010) or variations in the wind pattern (Zhao & Johns, 2014) , including impacts from tropical storms and hurricanes passing near the GS (Oey et al., 2007; Kourafalou FIGURE 1 Mean sea surface height (SSH) from AVISO satellite altimeters are shown in color (in meters) and the location of the GS is indicated by white arrows. The location of the FC measurement across the Florida Strait is indicated by a red line, and the location of Norfolk, VA, is indicated by a black star. The tracks of several storms, discussed in the paper, are shown with markers representing the location of the eye of the storm every 6 h. . Note that, on short-term scales, an important mechanism transferring largescale oceanic signals onto the shelf may involve the generation of coastaltrapped waves (Huthnance, 2004; Ezer, 2016) .\nThe mechanism that connects the GS and coastal sea level is as follows. The GS separates a lower sea level on its inshore side (blue in Figure 1) and a higher sea level on its offshore side (red in Figure 1 ). This sea level difference (~1 to 1.5 m) is proportional to the GS flow speed (i.e., the Geostrophic balance), so even a small and common daily change of say 10% in the GS flow may result in~10 cm sea level change; in comparison, this amount of global SLR would occur over~30 years. Therefore, a weakening in the GS flow is expected to raise coastal sea level and lower offshore sea level (the offshore impact has less important implications but can be detected from satellite altimeter data; Ezer et al., 2013) .\nIn this paper, the latest research on various mechanisms that can cause flooding are summarized, using several data sets including tide gauge data, observations of the Florida Current (FC; the upstream portion of the GS, see Figure 1 ), and a data set of historical hurricanes and tropical storms."}, {"section_title": "Data Sources", "text": "Hourly sea level records from tide gauge stations are available from NOAA (https://tidesandcurrents. noaa.gov/); here the focus is on the Sewells Point Station in Norfolk, VA (see star in Figure 1 ), which has the longest record in Hampton Roads. The estimated errors in measuring water level anomalies (say during a storm surge) are around \u00b15-10 cm. As a reference water level, the mean higher high water (MHHW) from the datum centered on 1992 is used. The definitions of minor (often called \"nuisance\"), moderate, and major flood levels relative to MHHW are consistent with NOAA's reports and recent studies of flooding (Ezer & Atkinson, 2014; Sweet & Park, 2014) .\nThe daily FC transport from cable measurements across the Florida Strait at 27\u00b0N (Baringer & Larsen, 2001; Meinen et al., 2010) is obtained from the NOAA/Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory website (http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/ phod/floridacurrent/); see the location in Figure 1 . Estimated errors are \u00b11.6 Sv (1 Sv = million cubic meter per second) with a mean transport of 32 Sv. The data include the periods 1982-1998 and 2000-2016 , with a gap of 2 years. The Atlantic hurricane and tropical storm data set HURDAT2 (Landsea et al., 2004; Landsea & Franklin, 2013) is available from NOAA's National Hurricane Center (http://www. nhc.noaa.gov/). It provides the track data every 6 h for storms in 1851-2016, but only data since the satellite age from the 1970s are used here."}, {"section_title": "FIGURE 2", "text": "The maximum water level at Sewells Point (Norfolk, VA) relative to the MHHW (1992 datum) for the major storms passing the region.

Also shown in horizontal dashed lines are the estimated levels of minor (0.53 m), moderate (0.835 m), and major (1.14 m) flood levels in Norfolk.\nSurface currents during hurricanes are obtained from NOAA's coupled operational Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting model (Yablonsky et al., 2015; Tallapragada, 2016) . The atmospheric model is coupled with the Princeton Ocean Model, which has horizontal resolution of 7-9 km and 23 vertical terrainfollowing layers with higher resolution near the surface; the model domain covers the western North Atlantic Ocean (10\u00b0N-47.5\u00b0N, 30\u00b0W-100\u00b0W ). A recent study used this model to evaluate the impact of hurricane Matthew (2015) .\nThe mean sea surface height in Figure 1 is obtained from the AVISO satellite altimetry data set that combines several available satellites; the data are now distributed by the Copernicus system (http://marine.copernicus. eu/). For comparisons between tide gauge and altimeter sea level data in the region, see Ezer (2013) ."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The Impact of SLR on Flooding in Hampton Roads Figure 2 shows the maximum water level (relative to MHHW) that has been reached in Sewells Point (Norfolk, VA) during the major storms that affected the region since recording started in 1927 (the highest recorded storm surge was during the hurricane of 1933). To illustrate how much SLR would affect storm surges over the years, an average rate of 4.5 mm/year (Ezer, 2013) is shown relative to 1930. For example, if the 1933's hurricane happened today, water level would reach~2 m, with unprecedented level of flooding and damage. Note the cluster of storms of the past two decades compared with the infrequent past storm surges.\nThis may be partly due to decadal variations in storms but most likely is the result of SLR, as smaller storms plus SLR can have similar impacts as larger past storms. The frequency of minor flooding is also greatly affected by SLR. For example, if a storm surge of say 0.6 m caused some minor flooding in the 1930s, an equivalent flooding would occur today with just~0.2 m water level over MHHW, so that even a slightly higher than normal tide would be enough to cause inundation without any storm. This is illustrated by the dramatic increase in the hours of minor flooding in Norfolk (Figure 3) . Other cities have similar acceleration in flooding hours (Ezer & Atkinson, 2014; Sweet & Park, 2014) . Note that seven of the top nine most flooded years happened since 1998. In addition to the clear impact of SLR and storms, there are interannual and decadal variations associated with more stormy years during El Ni\u00f1o and years with low North Atlantic Oscillation index or a weak AMOC (Ezer & Atkinson, 2014; Goddard et al., 2015) . The main reason for the large increase in flood hours is that past floods occurred mostly for short periods of a few hours to a day or so during the passage of strong storms. Today, we often see longer flooding periods that occur for several tidal cycles, sometimes even without any storm in sight, but these are possibly due to a weakening GS or an offshore storm (see discussion later)."}, {"section_title": "Examples of the Impact of Hurricanes on Flooding in Hampton Roads", "text": "There are three ways in which storms (tropical storms, hurricanes,"}, {"section_title": "FIGURE 3", "text": "The number of hours per year that water level in Norfolk is at least 0.53 m above MHHW; this level corresponds to minor street flooding (also known as nuisance flooding). Major storms in the most flooded years are listed, as well as indication (red triangles) of years with El Ni\u00f1o.\nMarch/April/ 2018 Volume 52 Number 2 or winter nor'easters) can cause flooding in Norfolk (and in other coastal cities): (1) Storm surges resulting from the direct impact of the low atmospheric pressure, winds, and waves; in this case, the storm piles up water against the coast or pushes water into the Chesapeake Bay and the Elizabeth River. (2) Indirect impacts from offshore storms that do not make landfall and do not pass near Norfolk; in this case, examples are storms that impact ocean currents like the GS (see discussion later). (3) Street flooding due to intense precipitation associated with the storm. Note that in many cases several of these mechanisms can apply simultaneously.\nAn example of Case 1 was Hurricane Isabel (2003), which resulted in the second higher water level ever recorded in Norfolk (Figure 2 ). This hurricane made landfall near Cape Hatteras, NC, and moved northwest south of the Chesapeake Bay (Figure 1) . Wind gusts of~30 m/s near Norfolk (Figure 4b ) caused a large storm surge that lasted a few hours ( Figure 4a) ; fortunately, the storm passed during the Neap tide period, so the addition of the high tide was minimal. An example of Case 2 is Hurricane Joaquin (2015), which looped in the South Atlantic Bight and stayed offshore for a long time without ever making a landfall (Figure 1) . However, the storm winds disturbed the flow of the GS (winds west of the storm blowing southward against the GS flow), as seen in the low transport of the FC (blue line; Days 270 and 280 in Figure 5b ). Because of the GS-coastal sea level relation discussed before (Ezer, 2016; , sea level rose (red line in Figure 5b) when GS transport dropped, causing a couple of weeks with flooding in Norfolk almost every high tide (Figure 5a ). An example of Case 3 is the impact of Hurricane Matthew (October 2016; see its track in Figure  1 ) on flooding in the Hampton Roads area (http://wavy.com/2016/10/08/ deadly-hurricane-matthew-soakshampton-roads-north-carolina/). When elevated water levels were combined with enormous amount of rain, streets could not drain and stayed flooded for a long period of time (in other regions along the South Carolina coast direct storm surge was a major factor in the flooding). The disturbance that Matthew caused to the flow of the GS can be seen in Figure 6 , from an operational atmosphere-ocean forecast model. When the eye of the storm was near the coast of south Florida, the storm broke the path of the flow, separating the FC exiting the Gulf of Mexico from the downstream GS. For more details on the impact of hurricane Matthew, see the recent study of . In the next section, analysis of many other storms will be examined to detect those that may have affected the GS."}, {"section_title": "The Impact of Tropical Storms and Hurricanes on the FC", "text": "Anecdotal examples of hurricanes affecting the GS (and its upstream portion, the FC) have been discussed above, so here a more quantitative approach is taken by analyzing the HURDAT2 data set of Atlantic hurricanes and tropical storms. The data set starts from the middle 1800s using ship observations and later satellitebased data (Landsea et al., 2004) . Here, only the data from the satellite era , which are more reliable, were considered. From the 6-hourly records of storms' location and strength, the number of days per year when storms of different categories are found in the region 60\u00b0W-85\u00b0W and 20\u00b0N-40\u00b0N were calculated, and the distribution is shown in Figure 7 . Many tropical storms and hurricanes that affect the U.S. East Coast pass through this region of the subtropical western North Atlantic, and the cyclonic oriented wind there can influence both the subtropical gyre flow and the GS. Sensitivity experiments with subtropical regions slightly different than that chosen above (not shown) yield very similar trends. Note that, instead of counting individual storms, the annual sum can include multiple counts of the same storm, so that storms that last longer have more weight than short-lived storms. The results appear to show that since the 1990s there is an increase in the occurrence of hurricanes in this region. For example, before 1995 no year had more than 10 days of Category 1-2 hurricanes or more than 3 days of Category 3-5 hurricanes in this region. However, since 1995 there were 8 years with more than 10 days of Category 1-2 hurricanes and 12 years with more than 3 days of Category 3-5 hurricanes. In other words, since 1995, there is over 50% chance that the strongest hurricanes (Categories 3-5) will be found in this region for at least 3 days (though only few of them will make landfall). Further statistical analysis of Atlantic hurricanes as done before (Landsea et al., 2004; Vecchi & Knutson, 2008; , and others) is beyond the scope of this study, which will focus on potential influence of the storms on the GS. The daily transport of the FC has been measured by a cable across the Florida Straits since 1982 (with a large gap October 1998-June 2000 and a few smaller gaps; see Meinen et al., 2010) . To evaluate if unusual transports are observed during the passage of storms, a subset of the cable data is created for only those days when storms are found in the region (as in Figure 7 ). Two properties are evaluated for these \"stormy\" days, the FC daily transport (Figure 8a ) and the FC daily transport change (Figure 8b) . The transport change is simply the daily change in transport from the observed transport of the previous day. Previous studies show that variations in coastal sea level are correlated with both the GS/FC transport and transport change Ezer & Atkinson, 2014 , 2017 . During \"stormy\" days, the FC transport can change significantly by as much as 5-8 Sv/day (see storms with significant impact in Figure 8b ). For example, when Hurricane Matthew (2016) moved along the coast (Figure 1) , the FC transport declined from~35 Sv t\u00f5 20 Sv (last column of \"x\"s in Figure  8a ) and the maximum daily decline was~5 Sv (Figure 8b ). For more analysis of the impact of Matthew, see .\nThe track of a hurricane relative to the location of the GS/FC can make a significant difference in the impact. For example, hurricanes that caused a large daily transport decline (Figure 8b ), like Barry (1983) , Karl (1998), and"}, {"section_title": "FIGURE 6", "text": "Example of surface currents on October 7, 2016, when Hurricane Matthew was near the south Florida coast (the eye of the storm is indicated by a circle). The simulations are from NOAA's Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting operational coupled ocean-atmosphere forecast system. See Figure 1 for the complete track of the storm."}, {"section_title": "FIGURE 7", "text": "The annual occurrence of tropical storms and hurricanes in the subtropical western North Atlantic region 60\u00b0W-85\u00b0W and 20\u00b0N-40\u00b0N during 1970-2016 . For each year, the number of days when tropical storms or hurricanes are found in the above region are calculated according to three storm categories: tropical storms in blue (maximum wind W max < 33 m/s), hurricanes Categories 1-2 in green (33 m/s < W max < 50) and hurricanes Categories 3-5 in red (50 m/s < W max ).\nWilma (2005), moved fast exactly over the FC not far from the Florida Strait (see their track in Figure 1 ). However, their influence on water level in Norfolk was minimal compared with hurricanes like Sandy (2012) or Matthew (2016), which moved slowly along the GS path (Figure 1 ) with enough time to influence the GS and coastal sea level.\nTo look at the total impact of storms on the FC transport in a more quantitative way, the histogram of the FC transport for all the days without storms (Figure 9a ) is compared with the histogram during days with storms ( Figure 9b ). Although the daily transport distribution looks Gaussian and symmetric around the mean during days with no storms, it is clearly asymmetrical with a lower mean flow and skewed probability toward low transports during storms (i.e., a longer \"tail\" of the distribution toward the left). Note that Figure 9a (\"without storms\") excludes days with tropical storms and hurricanes but may include other extratropical or winter storms that are absent from the HURDAT data set. This result confirms anecdotal observations (Ezer & Atkinson, 2014 , 2017 that storms can disturb the flow of the GS and thus in most cases increase the likelihood of weaker than normal GS-this weakening further contributes to higher than normal coastal sea level during particular periods. showed, using satellite altimeter data, high-frequency radar data and models that, after an intense mixing of the GS water by a nearby storm, may take a few days for the current to recover. During those days, anomalously high water can be observed along the U.S. East Coast and minor tidal flooding increased as well."}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusions", "text": "The impact of the fast rate of local SLR in the mid-Atlantic region (Boon 2012; Sallenger et al., 2012; Ezer & Corlett, 2012; Ezer, 2013) has already been felt in the acceleration of flooding in low-lying cities like Norfolk, FIGURE 8\n(a) FC transport (blue in Sv) and (b) transport change (red in Sv/day) during the time that a tropical storm or hurricane was recorded in the same region as in Figure 7 .

Some mechanisms are quite straightforward; for example, it is easy to understand how SLR or increases in storms frequency or intensity would result in more flooding and a greater risk of damages to flooded properties. However, other mechanisms are more complicated; for example, floods associated with nonlocal factors such as offshore variations in the GS (other remote influences such as westward-propagating planetary waves, climatic variations in the North Atlantic Ocean, or variations in wind and pressure patterns were discussed in other studies). This study follows on the footsteps of recent studies that showed a connection between short-term weakening in the FC/GS transport and elevated coastal sea level (Ezer, 2016; Ezer & Atkinson, 2014 , 2015 , 2017 Wdowinski et al., 2016) , but here the analysis includes for the first time an attempt to evaluate the impact on the GS from all the hurricanes and tropical storms that passed through the region over the past few decades. There is some indication that the most intense hurricanes (Categories 3-5) can be found more often near the subtropical western North Atlantic region, which is consistent with some other studies that suggest that warmer waters would cause an increase in the destructiveness of Atlantic hurricanes (Emanuel, 2005; Holland & Bruy\u00e8re, 2014) . The consequence is that, due to warmer Atlantic waters, hurricanes may be able to sustain their intensity longer if they stay offshore (e.g., Hurricanes Joaquin, Matthew, and other recent storms) and thus may have larger impact on the GS. It was found that hurricanes that moved across the GS path or stayed in its vicinity long enough are indeed those that have the largest impact on the GS. This indirect impact of offshore storms that sometimes do not even make landfall can result in several days of elevated water levels and tidal flooding, until the GS recovers and returns to its normal variability . When combined with storm-induced rain, these elevated water levels prevent proper draining of flooded streets and lengthening the impact, as was the case in the Hampton Roads during Hurricane Matthew (2016) . This remote impact from storms and hurricanes is more long-lasting than cases of storm surges near the landfall area that can result in higher water levels but shorter-term impact of only a few hours, as was the case of Hurricane Isabel (2003) .\nAnalysis of the FC transport since the 1980s suggests that the impact of tropical storms and hurricanes on the GS is not only detectable in a few isolated cases but has a significant signature in the long-term statistics of the flow variability. Therefore, during the time of the year when tropical storms are active, there is a greater probability of weaker than normal FC and higher than normal coastal sea level. Since remote/indirect forcing of coastal sea level variability is not easily accounted for in storm surge models, studies of this type can help to better understand the mechanisms involved and improve water level prediction.
