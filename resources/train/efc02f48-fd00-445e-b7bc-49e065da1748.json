[{"section_title": "Expansion of Ethanol Demand: Economic Implications for Indiana Corn Producers", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Matt Erickson", "text": "Page 1 Ethanol production in the United States is generating new challenges: increased investment in a domestic renewable energy source, the need to minimize potential adverse environmental impacts of increased corn production, and farmer's decisions to adopt crop production practices that will be profitable in the context of sharp increases in commodity and input prices, especially fertilizer and fuel. Ethanol is an alternative fuel source that can be blended with gasoline to generate a cleaner burning fuel. Ford Motor Company is promoting ethanol by increasing the number of cars that can run on E85 (E85 is the combination of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline). In the 2007 State of the Union Address, President George W. Bush urged Congress to encourage the expansion of ethanol and renewable fuel production to 35 billion gallons by 2017, which is five times the current level of production. The growth in demand for ethanol is resulting in the construction of numerous ethanol plants across the United States. The Renewable Fuels Association reports that there are 139 ethanol bio-refineries currently in operation in the United States and 62 under construction. In Indiana, the four ethanol plants in the towns of Rensselaer, Marion, Clymers, and Linden utilize approximately 160 million bushels of corn. (16% of Indiana's 2007 corn production.) (USDA-NASS) Corn farmers in the Midwest are re-examining the traditional cropping practice of a corn-soybean rotation. Some farmers are switching to the production practice of planting corn following corn in their rotation. With market corn prices above $5.00/bu., farmers anticipate that growing more corn may be more profitable, even with the associated higher variable costs for fertilizer and fuel. Since corn leaves more residue after harvest than soybeans, farmers may need larger machinery to till the corn residue into the soil for decomposition prior to planting the second year of corn. This will increase labor, fuel, repairs, and depreciation allowance costs. Also, agronomic research suggests there may be as much as a 10% yield penalty for second year corn (Vyn, 2004). However, with higher corn prices, farmers may be able to justify increased variable production costs if this results in a more profitable operation as a consequence of higher corn prices coupled with acceptable corn yields. The primary goal of this research was to better understand Indiana farmer's decision to adopt a corn following corn rotation. The research objectives were to: 1. Determine current and expected crop rotation systems in Indiana, including tillage systems. 2. Analyze corn yield impacts of increased corn acreage. 3. Identify the socio-economic characteristics of those Indiana farmers who are successfully making the transition toward increased corn acres."}, {"section_title": "Expansion of Ethanol Demand: Economic Implications for Indiana Corn Producers", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Matt Erickson", "text": "Page 2"}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "A survey was mailed to a random sample of 2000 Indiana farmers in August 2007. This study was funded by a Mission Oriented Grant from the Indiana Cooperative Extension Service and the Office of Agricultural Research Programs at Purdue University and was developed and coordinated by Drs. Bruce Erickson and Corinne Alexander. The Indiana Agricultural Statistics Service (IASS) assisted with the random selection of farmers, and coordinated the mailing of the survey. Before the survey was mailed to Indiana farmers, it was pre-tested among 46 farmers at the Top Farmer Workshop in July 2007. The Top Farmer Workshop is hosted by the Agricultural Economics Department at Purdue University. The purpose of the Top Farmer Workshop is to assist commercial producers to achieve their management goals. The purpose of the mailed survey was to acquire information from farmers on a variety of economic and agronomic topics that pertain to their field management practices. Farmers were asked to report their total acres for each crop (corn, soybeans, wheat, etc.), average yield for different cropping rotations, agronomic practices (nitrogen application, disease, etc.), yields, and planting rate for their largest corn after corn field. Farmers were also asked to report several socioeconomic factors (e.g., gross farm income, age, education, etc.). Perceptional data were collected via a Likert scale of 1 (disagree) to 5 (agree). A total of 239 farmers responded (a 12% response rate). There were no restrictions or limits imposed on farm size, corn acres, or gross income. The survey data were analyzed with SAS. Data from the 2002 Indiana Census of Agriculture served as a reference as to the representativeness of the mailed survey. Actual farmer field practices and yields relative to university research plot results were assessed using descriptive statistics. To determine the statistical significance of yields for each rotation, a Student t-test was used. Cross tabulation analysis was conducted for cropping systems relative to farm size, farmer education, farmer age, and other variables that may be associated with cropping systems. The cross tabulation analysis was based on a one-way ANOVA test."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Results", "text": "The statistical analysis compared the socioeconomic factors from the Indiana farmer survey with the 2002 Indiana Census of Agriculture. Second, the yield results from three rotations: continuous corn, corn/soybean, and 2 nd year corn were analyzed. Finally, market prices for corn and soybeans were analyzed. Previous studies serve as a reference in the analysis."}, {"section_title": "Farmer Age", "text": "The average age of the farmers in the survey is comparable to those in the Indiana Census of Agriculture. In the survey, the average age of the 228 farmers who responded was 55.6 years. The average age of Indiana farmers in the Census of Agriculture is 54 years (NASS, 2006)."}, {"section_title": "Farmer Education", "text": "In the mailed survey, education was reported in five categories: 1) some high school, 2) high school diploma, 3) some college/vocational technical work, 4) bachelor's degree, and 5) graduate degree. The 226 respondents in the Indiana survey who completed this question reported educational levels comparable to farmers in the Indiana Census of Agriculture. The 2002 Indiana Census of Agriculture reported the following educational percentages: 18% of farmers have less than a high school education; 37% of farmers have a high school diploma only; 26% of farmers have some college; and 19% have completed college. In the mailed survey, approximately 30% of the respondents have completed a college degree. This is much higher than reported in the Indiana Census of Agriculture of 19%. It is also important to consider the percentage of less than or equal to a high school degree. By adding the two categories of 2.7% and 36.3%, approximately 39% of the survey respondents have achieved a high school diploma or less. On the other hand, the Indiana Census of Agriculture indicates approximately 55% of farmers in Indiana have achieved a high school diploma or less."}, {"section_title": "Gross Income", "text": "The definition of total gross farm income used in the mailed survey and the 2002 Indiana Census of Agriculture is the total value of products sold, farm land rental income, and government program payments. The results of the survey and Indiana Census of Agriculture are quite different. Only 17% of the mailed survey respondents are in the less than $50,000 category while 75% of the farmers in the 2002 Indiana Census of Agriculture are in the less than $50,000 category. The 2002 Indiana Census of Agriculture reflects the many small farmers in Indiana, while in the mailed survey farmers report much higher total gross incomes. The mailed survey respondents reflect larger, commercial crop farmers in Indiana, and not the smaller, part-time producers that are widely found in Indiana."}, {"section_title": "Area Planted", "text": "According The survey clearly suggests that corn after corn acres in Indiana increased from 2006 to 2007. Hence, it is important to identify those farmers who diverted more acres to corn. Socioeconomic variables were tested against increased corn acres to determine if there are any statistically significant relationships. The socioeconomic variables examined were gross income, age, and educational attainment. Corn after corn was classified as a combination of two rotations: a continuous corn rotation and a 2 nd year corn rotation. The first socioeconomic variable tested against corn after corn acres was gross farm income. The independent variable, gross income, was categorized into five categories: 1 = Less than $50,000; 2 = $50,000-$99,000; 3 = $100,000-$249,000; 4 = $250,000-$499,999; and 5 = $500,000 or more. The ANOVA test generated an F value of 5.10 at \u03b1 > 0.0006. This suggests that farmers in the higher gross income categories were responsible for most of the increase in acres planted to corn in 2007 compared to 2006. In fact, as gross income increases the area planted to corn also increases. (Figure 1) Corn After Corn Acres The final socioeconomic variable tested against increased corn acres was the farmers' education level. The independent variable, education, was categorized as: 1 = some high school; 2 = high school diploma; 3 = some college/vocational technical work; 4 = bachelor's degree; and 5 = graduate degree. The ANOVA test generated an F value of 1.82 with an \u03b1 > 0.1258. This suggests that there is no statistically significant relationship between years of schooling and increased corn acres in 2007 compared to 2006. This relationship is not statistically significant at even a 10% level. (Figure 3) University research (Vyn et al, 2006 andVyn et al, 2007) and farmers' perceptions reported in the survey suggest differences in corn yields among rotations. Purdue University agronomic research indicates that there is a lower yield for a continuous corn rotation or second year corn relative to a corn/soybean rotation. Many farmers in the survey reported no differences in corn yields among their rotation systems. To capture farmers' yields, the survey asked farmers to report their five year yield average for corn on their largest field. The average yield reported for the continuous corn rotation was 157 bushels and for the corn/soybean rotation the average yield was 159 bushels. The Student t-value for the two rotations was 0.64. This indicates that these yield averages are not significantly different at \u03b1 > 0.01. Hence, farmers' yield perceptions appear to be contrary to Purdue University agronomic test plot research results. To further elaborate on this, the survey asked farmers to report average, highest, and lowest yields on their farms during the most recent 5-year period. The rotations that were analyzed and tested in this section include a 2 nd year corn rotation, a continuous corn rotation, and corn in a corn/soybean rotation. (Table 1) The survey results are reported separately based on the relationships between the yield class reported (average yield, highest yield, and lowest yield) and the crop rotation. The corn yield results were compared for each rotation and data set: 1) 2 nd year corn yield vs. continuous corn yield 2) 2 nd year corn yield vs. corn after soybeans yield and 3) continuous corn yield vs. corn after soybeans yield. (Table 2) A Student t-test was used to analyze the mailed survey data. The Student t-value analysis indicates that none of the yield relationships are statistically significantly different at \u03b1 > 0.01, except for two yield relationships. The 2 nd year corn high yield vs. corn/soybean high yield and the continuous corn high yield vs. corn/soybean high yield are statistically significantly different at \u03b1 > 0.01. These two observations are comparable to university yield data. Socioeconomic variables were tested against pairs of corn rotation yields to determine if there is a statistically significant relationship. The two rotations tested were a continuous corn rotation and a 2 nd year corn rotation. Socioeconomic variables again were gross income, age, and education level. The socioeconomic variables (independent variable) were categorized the same as in the increased corn acre analysis. The first socioeconomic variable tested against the continuous corn rotation yield was gross income. The ANOVA test generated an F value of 6.94 with an \u03b1 < 0.0001. This suggests that there is a statistically significant relationship between gross income and continuous corn yields at an \u03b1 > 0.01. There is a tendency for yields in a continuous corn rotation to increase as gross farm income increases. (Figure 5)  The second socioeconomic variable tested against yields from a continuous corn rotation was farmers' age. The ANOVA test generated an F value of 4.12 with an \u03b1 > 0.0022. This suggests that the relationship between farmers' age and corn yield for a continuous corn rotation is statistically significant at an \u03b1 > 0.01. It appears that farmers in the early to midcareer ages (i.e., 25 to 45) are more likely to have higher corn yields in a continuous corn rotation. (Figure 6) The final socioeconomic variable tested against yield from a continuous corn rotation was the farmer's education level. The ANOVA test generated an F value of 0.24 with an \u03b1 > 0.9146. This suggests that there is no statistically significant relationship between years of schooling and yield for a continuous corn rotation. This relationship is not statistically significant at even a 10% level. (Figure 7) The first socioeconomic variable tested against the 2 nd year rotation yield was gross farm income. The ANOVA test generated an F Value of 6.45 with an \u03b1 > 0.0001. This suggests that there is a statistically significant relationship between gross farm income and 2 nd year corn rotation yields at an \u03b1 > 0.01. (Figure 8) There is a tendency for yields in a 2 nd year corn rotation to increase as gross farm income increases. The second socioeconomic variable tested against yields from a 2 nd year corn rotation was farmers' age. The ANOVA test generated an F value of 1.22 with an \u03b1 > 0.3075. This suggests that the relationship between farmers' age and yield from a 2 nd year corn rotation is not statistically significant at an \u03b1 > 0.01. This relationship is not statistically significant at even a 10% level. (Figure 9) The final socioeconomic variable tested against yields from a 2 nd year corn rotation was the farmers' education level. The ANOVA test generated an F value of 1.17 with an \u03b1 > 0.3310. This suggests that there is no statistically significant relationship between years of schooling and yield from a 2 nd year corn rotation. This relationship is not statistically significant at even a 10% level.

They believe that yields are greater due to a reduction in soybean disease pressure and possibly fewer nematodes However, farmers' reported yields indicate a somewhat different result. The survey asked farmers to respond to the following: \"Soybean yield is higher after 2 nd year corn than 1 st year corn.\" A Likert scale response of 1 indicates that they strongly disagree and 5 indicates that they strongly agreed with the statement. The results from each category from 1 to 5 are as follows: 14.6%, 25.9%, 32.2%, 18.1%, and 9.3%. In essence, 40.5% of the respondents disagree with the survey statement while 27.3% of the respondents agree with the statement. This suggests that there is a slight bias towards farmer's disagreeing with the statement. Hence, a slight majority of farmers think soybean yields are lower following two or more years of corn."}, {"section_title": "Tillage Systems", "text": "The survey asked the respondents to indicate the primary tillage system in their largest field for a corn after corn rotation. The choices were: no-till, strip-till, chisel-disk, deep ripper, moldboard plow, or other. Of the 149 observations, the majority (59%) of the respondents used a chisel/disk tillage system. The other reported tillage methods were: 12% no-till, 1% strip-till, 10% deep ripper, 11% moldboard plow, and 6% reported another tillage system not listed on the survey. To further analyze tillage impacts on yield, university test plot research was compared to the survey results. Indiana farmers were asked to report their average corn yield for five years for three different corn rotations: corn/soybean, continuous corn, and 2 nd year corn. Four types of tillage systems were analyzed in response to corn yields: moldboard plow, chisel/disk, no-till, and deep ripper.   Crop Rotation Yields (1976-2006) Crop Rotation Yields (1997-2006 Yield Gain For Rotation (%) To determine yield gain for a corn/soybean rotation, the continuous corn and 2 nd year corn rotations serve as the base rotation. For instance, a moldboard plow tillage system in the survey indicated that there is a 3% yield decrease for corn in a corn/soybean rotation relative to a continuous corn rotation. The 3% yield decrease for moldboard plow between these two rotations slightly contradicts the Purdue University agronomic data. As for chisel plow and notill, the survey results are consistent with Purdue University agronomic data. However, it is important to recognize the magnitude of the yield gains between both of the no-till cases. Purdue University agronomic data indicate a much greater yield gain for a corn/soybean rotation in relation to a continuous corn rotation. The survey indicates a 6% yield gain for corn in a corn/soybean rotation relative to a continuous corn rotation, whereas university agronomic data reported an 18% yield gain. In addition to the yield gain between a corn/soybean rotation and a continuous corn rotation, 2 nd year corn was compared with a corn/soybean rotation. (Table 3)"}, {"section_title": "Price Analysis", "text": "The survey did not ask farmers to report input and commodity prices for their operation. However, it is important to analyze the impact of commodity prices and input costs on rotation selection and corn yields. Farmers often use a soybean/corn price ratio as a guide to adjust their rotation acres. Historically, the \"break-even\" price ratio for a 50/50 corn/soybean rotation has been around 2.5:1, indicating that the soybean price averages 2.5 times the corn price. With a continuous corn rotation, variable costs will increase along with machinery costs to manage the crop. However, if the demand for corn drives the market price high enough, a continuous corn rotation could be a profitable option for the farmer. A model created by Iowa State University illustrates that the most profitable rotation is determined by the corn price and nitrogen rate (Duffy, 2006).   (Dobbins, 2007). "}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Implications", "text": "A mailed survey was developed to analyze Indiana farmers' perceptions and experiences relative to the increased demand for corn due to ethanol production. Socioeconomic, agronomic, and economic variables were evaluated to determine which farmers in Indiana are increasing corn acres and yields. The survey reported that Indiana farmers who have higher gross farm incomes and in the early to mid career age range (25-45) increased their corn acres planted from 2006 to 2007. However, educational attainment and changes in corn acres planted from 2006 to 2007 were not statistically significant. As for corn yields, the survey reported that farmers with higher gross incomes and in the early to mid career age range (25-45) tend to produce higher yields with a continuous corn rotation. However, the relationship between educational attainment and continuous corn yield was not statistically significant. The survey indicated that Indiana farmers with higher gross farm incomes tend to report higher corn yields for a 2 nd year corn rotation. On the other hand, farmer's age and educational attainment were not statistically significant. The survey analyzed and reported tillage systems in relation to corn yields for a continuous corn rotation, 2 nd year corn rotation, and a corn/soybean rotation. Survey results are somewhat contrary to Purdue University agronomic test plot results. It was found from the survey that there was a yield loss between a corn/soybean rotation relative to a continuous corn rotation under a moldboard plow tillage system. Chisel/disk and no-till systems reported fairly consistent results in comparison with Purdue University agronomic test plot data. However, the yield gain for the no-till system for the corn/soybean rotation and the continuous corn rotation indicated a lower magnitude in comparison with Purdue University agronomic test plot data. This research offers information on farmers rotational adjustments in response to the recent increase in demand for corn for ethanol. From the farmers' standpoint, it is important to analyze both university agronomic research data as well as farmers' perceptions and experiences. With technologies, hybrids, machinery, and market prices constantly changing, Extension educators and crop consultants need to offer farmers up-to-date data that can help them with their managerial decisions. Comparing similarities and differences among farmers' cropping system decisions will allow for a free-flow of new ideas and techniques. Continuous corn is becoming a more popular rotation among some farmers due to the increase in the price of corn. However, not all farmers will profit from a continuous corn rotation. A spreadsheet economic analysis under alternative input and commodity prices as well as tillage and rotational systems is necessary to analyze different agronomic and economic scenarios."}]
