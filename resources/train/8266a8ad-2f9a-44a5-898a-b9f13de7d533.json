[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "cognitive and memory performance suggests that obesity may be contributing to premature brain aging. People with pre-existing medical conditions (e.g. AD, stroke, and myocardial infarction) were excluded from the study, so the BMI effects on cognition cannot be dismissed as simply a byproduct of other co-morbidities. Furthermore, the cohort on average was not severely obese, so the observed relationships between the obesity indices and cognition were occurring in the context of a typical community sample.

Additional research is needed to disentangle the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying obesity-associated brain dysfunction.
