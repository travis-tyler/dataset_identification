[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "A cross sectional study was carried out to investigate the effects of socio-economic, demographic and internet exposure factors on school performance among 10 grade students of Nilkhet High School. All of the eighty seven students were selected for this study. In this study school performance was measured by class roll number. The lower the class roll number the better the school performance. During Chisquare test grade (A+, A, A-, B, C, D) achieved in the class 9 final examination was taken as dependent variable. An upper grade indicates better school performance than lower grade. Class roll number were highly negatively correlated with the factors-actual income of the family, actual monthly tuition cost, number of rooms in the house, number of earning persons in the family, and this correlation was significant (p<0.01) at 1% level of significance. Chi-square test was used to check for association between the category of these factors and the school performance measured by grade. Chi-square test also found highly significant. In Chi-square test some of the other factors namely highest education of mothers (p<0.05), highest education of fathers (p<0.05), occupation of fathers (p<0.01), and occupation of mothers (p<0.05) were significant. Maximum 80.7% change in school performance was found when we studied the aggregate effects of fourteen factors. The school performance measured by grade of the students was significantly related with the work on internet and number of friends in Facebook because the Chi-square test shows the P-value<0.01. Maximum 43.5 % changes occurred in school performance when number of friends in Facebook was significant at 1% level of significance and both work on internet and Facebook account were significant at 10% level of significance."}, {"section_title": "Introduction:", "text": "Academic performance is the ability to study and remember facts and being able to communicate the acquired knowledge verbally or down on paper. A person's education is closely linked to their life chances, income, and well being 1 . The school performance of children is also heavily influenced by socio-economic and demographic factors. Sex has an influence on school performance, although it's a matter of dispute. The environment at home is a primary socialization agent and influences a child's interest in school and aspirations for the future. The socioeconomic status (SES) of a child is most commonly determined by combining parent's educational level, occupational status, and income level 2 . It is believed that low SES negatively affects academic achievement because low SES prevents access to vital resources and creates additional stress at home 3, 4, 2 . Research shows that supportive and attentive parenting practices positively affect academic achievement 3 . Maternal characteristics are another key factor that affect academic achievement 5, 3, 4 . Mothers who are more educated and have higher self-esteem have children who receive higher test scores 5, 3 . Smaller family size has been linked with higher academic achievement 3, 4 .\nFacility of internet use, time spent on internet and activities on internet plays a great role in the performance of school children. Research has examined the general impact of technology on academic achievement and development of children and teens. Positive and negative effects of technology achievement have been documented. Espinosa, Laffey, Whittaker, and Sheng (2006) investigated the role of technology in early childhood development using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study. The results indicated that access contributed to the learning potential of the students."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods:", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Type of Study:", "text": "A cross sectional sample survey was carried out among 10 grade students of Nilkhet High School in Dhaka city."}, {"section_title": "Basis for Selection of Study Place:", "text": "Well communicated.
