However, data from the National Institute on Aging (NIA) Alzheimer's Disease Centers collected from 2005 to 2010 found ranges for sensitivity of 70.9% to 87.3% and specificity of 44.3% to 70.8% when clinical diagnoses of possible and probable AD dementia are compared with postmortem histopathology diagnosis [2] . Florbetapir-F18 positron emission tomography (FBP PET) for estimating beta-amyloid neuritic plaque density was Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved in April 2012 and has high sensitivity (96%; 95% CI [confidence interval] 80%-100%) and specificity (100%; 95% CI 78%-100%) versus autopsy within 1 year [3] . Another positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer used to quantify amyloid deposits in the brain in research settings is Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) [4, 5] . Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of A\u03b2 , total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau 181P (p-tau) [6] are additional research tools with ongoing efforts to standardize across laboratories and patients [7, 8] .\nA model of the temporal order in which clinically measurable AD biomarkers become abnormal throughout the progression of AD has been proposed by Jack and colleagues [9] . According to this model, abnormal CSF A\u03b2 and amyloid PET findings are detected earliest, followed by CSF tau and other biomarker types. Deposition of A\u03b2 into plaques appears very early in the disease process during the asymptomatic stages prior to AD dementia. In contrast, elevated tau levels are downstream biomarkers that become strikingly more abnormal closer to the development of clinical symptoms [9] . Evidence continues to accumulate in support of this model [10] [11] [12] . Fagan and colleagues reported a similar CSF biomarker phenotype in patients with very mild AD symptoms (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR]=0.5) versus patients with more advanced AD (CDR>1) [13] .\nThere is no consensus for antemortem staging of AD clinical phases using biomarker thresholds and where the progression of neuropathological changes is hypothesized to be on a continuum beginning with a long asymptomatic period and culminating in dementia [14, 15] . Further, symptom severity is influenced by multiple factors, such as age [16] , premorbid functioning [17] , education [18] , cognitive reserve [14] , apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 (APOE4) allele carrier status [19] , and certain concurrent medical conditions [20] . Thus, there may be a discrepancy between the presence and degree of AD neuropathology with the expression of AD symptoms on an individual basis. These challenges underscore the need for additional tools, such as AD clinical biomarkers, to aid the accurate diagnosis and staging of AD across the continuum of clinical progression [21] .\nThe CSF A\u03b2 and tau analytes and amyloid PET neuroimaging as adjunctive biomarkers for diagnosis of AD are not commonly used in clinical practice but have the potential to significantly impact accuracy of a clinical diagnosis. There is a small amount of emerging literature about their relationship to each other across the spectrum of disease progression. Studies of the amyloid brain deposits assessed with PiB PET and CSF levels of A\u03b2 found an inverse relationship between them, no relationship between PiB and CSF t-tau or p-tau, and discordance with clinical diagnosis where some healthy controls had evidence of amyloid positive status by both PiB and CSF A\u03b2 [4, 5] . Binary classification using PiB PET and CSF-A\u03b2 1-42 overlapped in 96.4% [4] .\nWe explored cross-sectional relationships between FBP PET and CSF biomarkers among groups of healthy control (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD dementia subjects enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) using approaches not previously reported. We measured correlations between regional and composite FBP PET values and CSF A\u03b2 1-42, t-tau, and p-tau, and their ratios in diagnostic groups. We used logistic regression to compare composite FBP PET values with CSF A\u03b2 1-42, t-tau, and p-tau in distinguishing between diagnostic groups including evaluating for additive contributions by the other biomarker type."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects and study design", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the NIA, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the FDA, private pharmaceutical companies and non-profit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-year public-private partnership. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials.\nThe Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center and University of California -San Francisco. ADNI is the result of efforts of many coinvestigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the United States and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 subjects, but ADNI has been followed by ADNI-GO and ADNI-2. To date these 3 protocols have recruited over 1500 adults, ages 55 to 90, to participate in the research, consisting of cognitively normal older individuals, people with early or late MCI, and people with early AD. The follow-up duration of each group is specified in the protocols for ADNI-1, ADNI-2, and ADNI-GO. Subjects originally recruited for ADNI-1 and ADNI-GO had the option to be followed in ADNI-2. For up-todate information, see www.adni-info.org.\nData were downloaded in August 2012 from ADNI-GO/2 which included FBP PET scans. Participants were recruited from outpatient memory clinics. Clinical diagnoses were assigned to participants by the site investigators and reassessed at each visit. Normal age-matched control subjects showed no signs of depression, MCI, or dementia (www.adniinfo.org). Participants with MCI were required to present education-adjusted ranges on the Logical Memory II subscale from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised: \u2265 16 years of education -9 to 11 for early MCI, \u2264 8 for late MCI; 8 to 15 years of education -5 to 9 for early MCI, \u22644 for late MCI; 0 to 7 years of education -3 to 6 for early MCI, \u2264 2 for late MCI. Additionally, participants with MCI had Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores between 24 and 30 (inclusive), a CDR of 0.5 with a Memory Box score \u2265 0.5, and preserved activities of daily living. Participants with AD dementia met the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke -Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria for probable AD. At subsequent visits, diagnoses were categorized as HC, MCI, or AD.

Correlations between both t-tau and p-tau and several FBP PET variables did reach statistical significance in the MCI group. In the AD dementia group, no significant correlations were observed (Table 2) .

Both amyloid-related biomarkers were highly correlated with each other. Overall, the amyloid-related biomarkers were not appreciably different with respect to categorical clinical classification in that adding one to the other in logistic regressions did not improve classification.\nSpecifically, in logistic regression analyses, neither CSF A\u03b2 1-42 nor FBP PET distinguished HC and MCI, probably because amyloid pathology in those who could later progress to clinical AD had already manifested. However, CSF A\u03b2 1-42 and FBP PET each distinguished HC from AD groups, as did CSF t-tau and p-tau. Additionally, CSF t-tau also significantly differentiated AD dementia from MCI, and CSF p-tau distinguished between HC and AD dementia groups.\nThese findings with CSF tau are consistent with CSF tau abnormalities manifesting later and progressively in the disease, as compared to amyloid plaque, which exhibits substantial deposition by the time patients present with MCI [9] .\nCSF A\u03b2 1-42 but not FBP PET significantly distinguished MCI from AD dementia groups; however, FBP PET was close to the threshold applied by the Holm-Bonferroni correction for the multiple comparisons method, and it is possible that a better-powered study might have found a different result. Once a person has positive binary status the rate of amyloid SUVR increase is slower during MCI and dementia stages than in the decades before MCI [15] .\nWe found a number of statistically significant correlations between the biomarker types, especially those that involved beta-amyloid. Although significant correlations between CSF tau measures and FBP PET variables were seen, the values of the correlation coefficients were relatively lower unless CSF tau was in a ratio with CSF A\u03b2 .\nWithin the HC and MCI groups, we found some strong and significant correlations for FBP PET with CSF A\u03b2 , with the anterior and posterior cingulate ROIs and composite SUVRs being the most notable. This is consistent with the known neuroanatomical progression pattern of AD where cingulate gyri are affected early with beta-amyloid plaque. In the AD dementia group, the highest correlations were between CSF A\u03b2 1-42 and FBP PET, but no correlations reached statistical significance. However, it needs to be considered that the sample size for the AD dementia group was much smaller than the other groups.\nInterestingly, CSF t-tau provided differentiation in the comparisons of HC versus AD dementia and MCI versus AD dementia, but not HC versus MCI. This suggests that amyloid-related biomarkers are informative as adjunctive tests for establishing an AD diagnosis since the associated pathology starts long before clinical symptoms appear, while tau may be more helpful for staging because it accumulates in the later stages of the disease, as has been described previously. While CSF A\u03b2 1-42 changes are observed 5 to 10 years before conversion of MCI to AD dementia, CSF t-tau and p-tau seem to be markers of later stage pathology [24] . Thomann and colleagues associated changes in CSF t-tau and p-tau with neurodegenerative changes in MCI subjects who converted to early AD dementia [25] . Alternatively, some studies have suggested that tau abnormalities at the cellular level may begin in the asymptomatic period before or simultaneously with amyloid [26] , but our current clinical biomarker methodologies may not be targeted or sensitive enough to detect those [27] . Dor\u00e9 and colleagues recently described longitudinal (18-and 36-months) relationships among A\u03b2 deposition, cortical thickness, and memory [28] . They reported a faster rate of gray matter atrophy in the temporal cortex and hippocampi and greater episodic memory impairment in clinically unimpaired individuals who were amyloid positive on PiB PET than those who were amyloid negative [28] . A longitudinal study published by the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) research group estimated that it takes 19.2 years (95% CI 16.8-22.5) for subjects to progress from the threshold of PiB PET positivity to amyloid levels observed in AD dementia [15] . After the emergence of symptoms of AD, the rate of A\u03b2 deposition slowed and then plateaued at the dementia stage [15] . Additionally, a study of 401 ADNI subjects found that reduction in the CSF A\u03b2 1-42 level becomes dynamic early, whereas changes in CSF t-tau levels and adjusted hippocampal volumes occur later and may be biomarkers of downstream pathophysiological processes [29] . However, a study by Driscoll and colleagues in non-demented individuals did not observe a correlation between the level of amyloid load and longitudinal brain volume changes [30] .\nThe generalizability of our results to the broader population is uncertain and potentially limited by the study sample. We used data from ADNI-GO and ADNI-2 cohorts, which represents a selected convenience sample including subjects with amnestic MCI, but also higher education and cognitive reserve. Compared to the ADNI cohort, the population-based sample in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) [31] was older and less educated, and had lower MMSE scores and less frequent family history of AD. The rate of hippocampal volume decline was larger in ADNI subjects compared with MCSA, suggesting more advanced brain pathology in ADNI subjects [31] . Additionally, analyzing early and late MCI subjects as 1 group might have affected our findings. Further, because ADNI used a central laboratory to test CSF, the lack of standardization of CSF AD biomarker measurements across clinical sites and assays may limit the applicability of our results to clinical practice. Finally, the analyses presented here are based on cross-sectional and not longitudinal data. Prospective, longitudinal studies are needed to confirm or refute our findings. The strengths of our study are the relatively large HC and MCI sample sizes and the combination of CSF and FBP PET measures where most prior work was reported using PiB PET.\nIn conclusion, we found some unique characteristics, but also considerable overlap between CSF and FBP PET measures when assessing their ability to distinguish among pairs of HC, MCI, and AD dementia groups. We report both composite and ROI correlations for FBP PET with CSF. Our findings of differences in differentiation of AD stages by amyloid versus tau biomarkers might aid in the development of further diagnostic and staging tools for AD.
