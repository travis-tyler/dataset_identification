At an individual-level, however, measuring brain volume alterations is problematic given the lack of reference standards to estimate the degree of deviation from the normality according to one's characteristics.\nIndeed, although many studies have described the influence of age and sex on brain volumes (Fjell et al., 2013; Luders et al., 2009; Pfefferbaum et al., 2013; Walhovd et al., 2011) , very few attempts have been made to produce proper neuroanatomical volumetric normative data (Brain Development Cooperative Group, 2012; Kruggel, 2006) . The many obstacles inherent to neuroimaging research likely undermine this shortcoming. To produce normative data, brain segmentation procedures need first to be replicable and thus ideally automated. However, automated segmentation techniques are often proprietary, and therefore not readily accessible outside of the technical teams that developed them. It can be readily shown that regional brain volumes display important variability according to the segmentation techniques (Mouiha and Duchesne, 2011; Tae et al., 2008) and anatomical definitions (Boccardi et al., 2014) . Secondly, scanner characteristics, especially related to each manufacturer and magnetic field strength (MFS), have a non-negligible impact on regional brain segmentation (Jovicich et al., 2009; Kruggel et al., 2010; Pfefferbaum et al., 2012) . Finally, to produce neuroanatomical volumetric normative data useful across the lifespan, a large sample of individuals covering a wide age range is needed; however, given that MRI is an expensive proposition, a single laboratory or team can achieve such sample sizes with difficulty.\nOur objective was to build normative data for subcortical regional volumes covering adulthood to facilitate neuroscience imaging studies.\nTo this end, we federated a large sample of cognitively healthy individuals originating from 23 different datasets. We produced estimates of subcortical regional volumes using FreeSurfer, a widely used and freely available automated segmentation software. We built models predicting expected volumes for each subcortical region according to age, sex, estimated total intracranial volume (eTIV), scanner manufacturer, and MFS. The expected volumes allow testing each region for volume abnormality, effect sizes and estimates of the normative population with a smaller volume. These models are presented within the article and a statistics calculator is freely distributed as supplementary material (see the Subcortical norms calculator in Potvin et al., submitted for publication) ."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Normative sample", "text": "We assembled a sample of 3D T1-weighted MRI scans from 2799 cognitively healthy controls aged 18 to 94 years from 23 samples provided by 21 independent research groups (see Table 1 and for details).\nOf note, this includes the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu), launched in 2003 as a publicprivate partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. (www.adni-info.org) . Scans were acquired from one of the three leading manufacturers (e.g. Siemens Healthcare, Philips Medical Systems, or GE Healthcare) at MFS of either 1.5 or 3 Tesla. For each dataset, approval from the local ethics board and informed consent of the participants were obtained.\nAll samples recruited healthy control participants, except NKI1 and NKI2. Databases with older adults excluded neurological diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders with extensive assessments for age-related disorders. For databases recruiting in the general population (NKI1 and NKI2), we excluded participants with schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, bipolar disorders, major depressive disorders and substance abuse/dependence disorders. Additional exclusions were made for NKI2: neurodegenerative and neurological disorders, head injury with loss of consciousness/amnesia, and lead poisoning. Moreover, for PPMI, additional exclusions were made for participants with a Geriatric Depression Scale (Sheikh and Yesavage, 1986) score of more than 5 (inclusion criterion used in ADNI and AIBL databases). All images were visually inspected and four participants were discarded because of evident brain abnormalities. Five participants with extreme eTIV values were also excluded (Z scores higher than 3.29, p b .001). The final sample included 2790 individuals aged between 18 and 94 years (mean: 47.6, SD: 21.8), with a similar proportion of men (n = 1389) and women (n = 1401). More than half of the scans were acquired using Siemens (n = 1524), a third using Philips (n = 787), and 17% using GE (n = 479) units. Fifty-three percent of the images were obtained using 3 T MFS (n = 1487). Most of the datasets also had information about handedness (79%), race (60%), and education (58%). Based on the available data, the vast majority of the normative sample was right-handed (91%), Caucasian (82%; African 10%; Asian 7%), and had completed high school (95%).

All raw T1-weighted images were first converted into MINC format and then were processed using the \"recon-all\" pipeline with the default set of parameters.\nFreesurfer was running on an Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS platform on a Dell PowerEdge R910 computer with four Intel Xeon E7-4870 2.4 GHz. The technical details of FreeSurfer have been described elsewhere (Fischl et al., 2002; Fischl et al., 2004; Jovicich et al., 2006; Segonne et al., 2004) . The FreeSurfer software belongs to a class of segmentation techniques using a model-driven paradigm. In these approaches the algorithm first matches the new image to a template and/or series of templates from a training set, for which segmentation has been performed a priori, and therefore label information exists. The algorithm then automatically assigns a neuroanatomical label to each voxel of a volume based on the probabilistic information given by the image matching procedure. Specifically, it assigns the most likely probability for that voxel, taking into consideration nearby voxel probabilities. Every structure defined in the a priori segmentation therefore becomes represented in the new image, based on the overall matching between images. Subcortical and estimated total intracranial volumes (eTIV) (Buckner et al., 2004) were taken from the aseg.stats Freesurfer output file. Ventricles and corpus callosum volumes were generated using the sum of all subregions. FreeSurfer subcortical segmentation showed a high overlap and high volumetric correlations with manual segmentation (Dewey et al., 2010; Fischl et al., 2002; Keller et al., 2012) and high test-retest reliability Morey et al., 2010) .\nVisual inspection of each brain segmentation was conducted using FreeView (http://freesurfer.net) by scrolling the entire brain at least through the coronal and axial planes. Regions with apparent segmentation error on multiple slices were excluded of statistical analyses (e.g. portion of gray matter not segmented, portion of a ventricle segmented as white matter, hippocampal portion segmented as neocortex). Depending on the region, between 0 and 58 participants out of 2790 were discarded (for the overall measures of ventricles and subcortical gray matter, which encompassed all the ventricles and all the gray matter regions, 2 and 96 participants were excluded, respectively). Moreover, to verify the validity of outermost eTIV values, we verified the registration of the 5% lowest and highest values.\nIn order to assure generalizability, we quantified the impact of a different hardware setup on the volumes generated by FreeSurfer (Xubuntu 12.04 on VirtualBox 4.3.10 installed on an iMac 10 GB 1067 MHz DDR3 with 2.8 GHz Intel Core i7 and OS X Yosemite 10.10.4).

Quadratic and cubic terms for age and eTIV were tested, as well as the following interactions: age X sex, eTIV X MFS, MFS X manufacturer, and eTIV X manufacturer. To avoid overfitting and maximize generalizability of the predictions, the best predictive model was determined with a 10-fold cross-validation (Hastie et al., 2008) , retaining the model with the subset of predictors that produced the lowest predicted residual sum of squares using SAS 9.4 PROC GLMSELECT (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). For each selected final model, the fit of the data was assessed using R 2 (one minus the regression sum of squares divided by the total sum) and individual predictors' weight was measured by semi-partial eta squares (squared semi-partial correlations). For each brain subdivision and eTIV, outliers with volume Z scores higher than 3.29 (p b .001) were excluded (depending of the region, between 5 and 25 outliers out of 2790 were excluded).

Age had a substantial effect for all regions except the brainstem. The effect of sex varied greatly across regions, with the strongest impact for the brainstem and the weakest for the fourth ventricle and the corpus callosum. Fig. 2 illustrates predicted volumes for each region according to age and sex. All relationships between age and volume were nonlinear, and included either cubic or quadratic terms. A few regions, including the accumbens, pallidum, and putamen, had a marked age by sex interaction. Fig. 3 displays some examples of the MFS, eTIV, and manufacturer effects observed.

In fine, our data came from 2790 individuals aged 18 to 94 years old, and scanned in the context of 23 different studies.

The formulas generate expected volumes for a given age, sex, eTIV, scanner manufacturer, and magnet strength. The difference between a real volume and a predicted normative volume divided by the root mean square error will result in a Z score effect size, which reflects the degree of deviation from the normative sample. The spreadsheet provides prediction intervals and suitable statistics including individual significance test for abnormality, effect size (Z OP ) and estimated percentage of the normative population with a smaller volume. One will notice that although not identical, the individual significance test for abnormality is generally very close to the effect size. This subtle difference will not have a major impact if one uses either the t-statistic or the effect size (with 1.65 one-tailed and 1.96 two-tailed as critical values), but is of theoretical importance since the use of the effect size for inferential purposes would treat the normative sample as the Fig. 2 .

Moreover, in the case of using the normative values to compare values for a group of individuals, assessing the difference between actual and expected volumes, using a two-sample t-test for example (as shown in Table 4 ), the distinction between the effect size and the significance of the test is crucial for interpreting the result, since the mean Z OP can greatly differ from the t-statistic value depending on the sample size of the group. Indeed, even when effect sizes are small, significant differences between actual and expected volumes can be observed if the group is large.\nThe validation of the normative values using clinical samples is a good example of how the normative formula can be used and it showed volume differences for the regions that were expected. Results in the SZ group were generally coherent with those of a meta-analysis indicating that compared to controls, medicated patients with schizophrenia show significant atrophy for accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus and hypertrophy for the pallidum of small effect sizes (Haijma et al., 2013) . Results in the mild AD group were also coherent with previous results from the literature showing essentially ventricles enlargements and atrophy of the hippocampus and amygdala, but also changes to other regions such as the accumbens area, the thalamus, and the corpus callosum (Pedro et al., 2012; Pievani et al., 2013; Roh et al., 2011; Scahill et al., 2002) .\nAnother utility of the volumetric normative values is to verify in case-control studies whether or not the control group is close to normative values. Control groups, especially if they are of small sizes, are not necessarily good representations of the normality."}, {"section_title": "Effect of age", "text": "In addition to producing normative values, the large sample allowed the validation of relationships that were previously observed using different methodologies. The results importantly showed the respective weight related to each predictor. Age was the predictor with the greatest influence on all regions, except on the brainstem, with most regions starting to decline as early as 18 years of age. Our results indicated that those regions declining latest in life are the brainstem, which showed a slight decrease in men after their 40s, and for women after their 60s; the hippocampi, in which volumes were relatively stable until the 4th decade; and the corpus callosum, which increases late to the 30s, before declining eventually. Walhovd et al. (2011) and Fjell et al. (2013) , using substantial yet smaller samples, reported comparable results.\nUnlike other regions, both caudate nuclei volumes showed a distinctive U-shape relationship with age, decreasing from entry into adulthood to the 60s, and then increasing to the 90s. Similar results were previously observed (Fjell et al., 2009; Fjell et al., 2013; Goodro et al., 2012; Pfefferbaum et al., 2013; Walhovd et al., 2011) . Goodro and colleagues suggested that periventricular white matter signal hyperintensities, which is highly correlated with age, could be responsible for this increase of caudate volume, from the age of 60 onward. An alternate hypothesis could be a selection bias related to the survival of individuals. Thus, this replicated finding could be either a true phenomenon due to aging, the result of a cohort effect, or an artifact interfering with the MRI signal; the design of this study cannot conclusively determine either way. Nevertheless, given our design and these results, this phenomenon is not trivial and the volume of the caudate nuclei in older adults has to be expected to be larger than in younger adults when using MRI measures such as those produced by FreeSurfer on recent recruited cohorts."}, {"section_title": "Effect of sex", "text": "Whether differences in regional brain volumes between men and women remain after taking into account TIV are still a matter of debate in the literature (Crivello et al., 2014; Jancke et al., 2015; Leonard et al., 2008; Luders et al., 2009 ), but previous results indicated that the effect of sex on regional brain volumes is heterogeneous across the brain. Our results are in agreement with this finding, showing that although sex improved the prediction in all models, its influence had notable discrepancies between regions and diminishes with age in some regions. Sex had the greatest influence on the brainstem while it had little impact on the volumes of the accumbens, hippocampi, the ventricles, and the corpus callosum. The latter has received a lot of attention (Leonard Fig. 3 . Fitted data illustrations of the magnetic field strength (MFS) and manufacturer effects in the models predicting subcortical volumes.

In the present study, the corpus callosum was the region, after the left accumbens, with the least influence of sex on its volume (2% of explained variance).\nMoreover, although sex by age interaction improved the prediction for most regions, with left accumbens, left pallidum and right putamen showing the strongest interaction, it had little influence compared to the other predictors (R 2 \u2264 1%). These results corroborate those from other studies (Crivello et al., 2014; Fjell et al., 2009; Jancke et al., 2015) , which showed no or subtle sex by age interaction for subcortical structures."}, {"section_title": "Effect of scanner characteristics", "text": "Previous reports had shown that scanner manufacturer and MFS have an influence on automated brain volume segmentation that needs to be taken into account (Jovicich et al., 2009; Kruggel et al., 2010; Pfefferbaum et al., 2012) . In the present study, both manufacturer and MFS were retained in the models for the normative prediction of all regions (with the lateral ventricles as the sole exception). However, when compared to age, sex and eTIV, the magnitude of their main and interaction effects was minor (i.e. together, mean R 2 of 3.7%) with two exceptions: the left accumbens (R 2 : 9.6%) and the left amygdala (R 2 : 8.6%). Thus, despite having a positive impact on prediction, the influence of these scanner characteristics on subcortical volumes remains modest compared to other predictors. Moreover, the best comparison in order to detect subtle neuroimaging effects is clearly within the same scanner. However, when this is not possible, a correction for scanner manufacturer and MFS is a minimal procedure that should be done in order to minimize variance not due to the effect of interest."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "One should note that the federated normative sample was not randomly recruited, nor representative of the healthy adult population. Rather, it is comprised of healthy volunteers who agreed to participate in research projects involving MRI, within academic-led environments. The majority was right-handed, Caucasian, and had at least a high school degree. Thus, the normative values may not be generalizable to left-handed, non-Caucasian, or low-educated individuals. While it may not be an exact picture of the healthy adult population, this is one of the largest sample used in such study and included a wide age range. The data involved 23 samples from 21 independent research groups, originating from various countries (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, United Kingdom, and USA). Further, the large age range and the wide array of MRIs from three manufacturers at two magnetic field strengths, using multiple acquisition parameters, is an amalgam of data likely to produce more robust normative values than values generated, for example, using a sample recruited by a single research group at a particular geographic location and using a single set of acquisition parameters. Indeed, the validation procedure with independent samples of healthy individuals showed similar prediction in terms of R 2 for the majority of the regions.\nMoreover, MRI technology is relatively recent and there is no longitudinal data available spanning the lifetime of single individuals. Since the present study is cross-sectional, age effects may encompass cohort biases. Finally, as our goal was to produce normative values that could be used in other studies, we chose to use FreeSurfer, an automated segmentation software, with its default parameters. One should note that FreeSurfer, especially with default parameters, may not be the best solution for the segmentation of all subcortical regions. One of the limitations of model-driven algorithms is that every structure present in the a priori training set model is to be represented in the new image being segmented. This will happen whether or not the image matching procedure is able to find anatomically relevant, contrasted landmarks on the images for each specific substructure, given that the matching happens first at the global level, then at the local level, but optimized over an entire neighborhood. The end result is that some structures may be defined by virtue of being inside a given region that represents the software's best attempt at adapting the pre-defined mask with respect to the overall shape of the new subject's brain, as opposed to being within clearly establishedand visibleboundaries. This effect may result in the representation of the structure to include inaccuracies; in the case of smaller structures, errors at the boundaries may have a potentially larger effect on overall volume compared to larger structures. However, given that we have used the exact same approach for all images, and that users of the normative data will be constrained to using this same approach, we expect this possible bias to be systematic and thus, having a quite restrained effect on inter-subject differences."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "At a group-level, many neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders display specific anatomical MRI changes. However, measuring brain volume alterations at an individual-level is problematic since it needs reference values from an automated reproducible segmentation technique taking into account the characteristics of the individual and of the scanner.

Estimates of the expected volumes of an individual based on its age, sex, intracranial volume, the scanner's manufacturer, and magnet strength can be obtained using derived formulas. Statistics allow testing each region for volume abnormality with effect sizes and estimates of the normative population with a smaller volume."}]
