[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "ABSTRACT"}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "ach year US colleges and universities graduate thousands of students eager to make their mark in the world. After spending several years in relatively close contact with the college or university the student proudly accepts their diploma, happily leaves the school and, in many cases never has any further contact with the school. Sure, the institution tries to maintain a list of graduates for future contact, usually for fund raising programs. When one of the graduates rises to prominence the university will try to reestablish contact, again for fund raising. But why don't universities maintain contact with graduates to see how well their education is serving them and how they are progressing in their chosen careers? Matti Lindberg (2007, pp. 623-644) has stated that higher education \"must worry about the employability of the graduates and the efficiency on the system, even Present Age though priority is placed on making the system available for the masses.\" This comment suggests that worldwide universities don't place an emphasis on employability of their graduates. Given this standard it would seem that accounting programs need to develop a more continuing relationship with their graduates and place a greater emphasis on the employability of their graduates. The accounting program in a medium sized Midwestern university recently applied for \"Specialized Accounting Accreditation\" and found that only anecdotal data was available to satisfy this standard. In order to satisfy section 33 of the standards a questionnaire was developed and emailed to a list of accounting graduates."}, {"section_title": "THE SURVEY", "text": "The questionnaire is shown in appendix I. A list of 1,026 email addresses for accounting graduates was obtained from the alumni office and questionnaires were sent by email to each of the graduates. As expected, some of the email addresses were outdated and 269 were returned as undeliverable leaving 757 questionnaires delivered to accounting graduates. A total of 212 were returned for a 28% response rate with 103 (48%) requesting a copy of the results. This response rate compares favorably to that of other surveys'. "}, {"section_title": "Figure 3: Respondents Entering Graduate Program", "text": "As seen in figure 1 and figure 2, the average age of the respondents was 44.2 years and the average graduation year was 1986, suggesting that the average age at graduation (21 years ago) was 23 years. The oldest graduate was 74 and the youngest was 22. The 74 year old graduated in 1954 and changed jobs 5 times in their career. The youngest respondent graduated in 2006. Both the youngest and oldest respondent obtained accounting positions before they graduated. Figure 3 indicates that only 36 (17%) of the respondents entered a graduate program upon completion of the undergraduate degree while 83% began their careers. One requirement of standard 33 is to demonstrate success with regard to \"placement of students within three months of graduation.\" As can be seen in table 1and then more clearly in figure 4 , more than one half of the respondents (97) had obtained their first professional position before graduation and 90% had obtained a professional position within three months of graduation. That 90% success within three months of graduation is very satisfying considering that the time span was 52 years (1954 to 2006) and that some percentage of the graduates will be less than top students. The National Center for Education Statistics conducted the Baccalaureate and Beyond (B&B) survey for students who received their bachelor's degrees in 1992-93 or 1999-2000. This study showed that 27.3 percent of all students were unemployed three months after graduation with an additional 13.1 percent only worked part time. Clearly accounting graduates responding to the survey were doing better than the national average for all students. The Destinations of Leavers from Higher Education Survey (DLHE) is carried out by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) in the UK for the 2000/01 academic year shows that six months after graduation 71% of all business school graduates seeking employment were successfully employed on a full time basis. This is lower than the success rate for the current study after only 3 months.\nAlthough they all work in accounting areas, there were different starting points as shown in figure 5. In the study 40% (82) of those positions were in public accounting with another 27% in industry and 13% with government. Only 20% accepted jobs outside these three areas. Additionally, 56% of the positions were as an entry level accountant and an additional 16% were in the audit function.\nRespondents were asked how many times they had changed companies in their careers and, remarkably as shown in figure 6, 23% (47) had never changed companies. In a survey published in the CPA Journal 61.7 percent of all graduates had changed jobs at least once after 3 years in the job market. These respondents were not all recent graduates as they had graduated an average of 12 years earlier. Two had graduated in the 1960s, nine in the 1970s, four in the 1980s and another six graduated in the 1990s. So, approximately half of the respondents who had never changed companies had graduated before 1995. All of the graduates, except for one, who had never changed companies, were satisfied with the progression of their careers. Another 13% had changed companies one time and another 13% had changed two times. Another requirement of standard 33 is to demonstrate \"career success of graduates at an appropriate later time (e.g., 5 or 10 years).\" Graduates were asked if they were \"satisfied with the progression of your career.\" Remember, on average they had been graduated for about 12 years. As shown in figure 7, 97% indicated that they were satisfied with the progression of their careers. That indicates that they have achieved career success as the ACCSB defines success.\nRespondents were asked if they believed their education at Marshall adequately prepared them for their career and 95%, figure 8, responded affirmatively, a great vote of confidence in their accounting program. As shown in figure 9, 97% indicated that they would recommend the accounting program at Marshall to their children or friends, another vote of confidence. "}, {"section_title": "Relationships", "text": "Nonparametric Kendall's tau b coefficients, shown in table 2, were calculated for the relationships between the different items in the questionnaire. Not surprisingly, a significant (0.000) negative relationship existed between both the year of graduation and the number of times the respondent had changed companies. There was also a significant (0.001) positive relationship between age and the number of times the respondent had changed companies, again suggesting that older respondents changed companies more often. Obviously, older respondents have had more time in which to change companies. In order to validate this observation a calculation was made of the years since graduation divided by the number of company changes for each respondent. This number \"work years per company change\" was regressed against the graduation year and was negatively correlated at the 0.000 level. There was also a significant (0.000) positive relationship between \"work years per company change\" and age. These two factors indicate that recent graduates change companies more often than do earlier graduates -a trend not unexpected.\nThere was a significant negative (0.031) relationship graduation year and entering a graduate program and a significant positive (0.023) relationship between age and entering a graduate program. As seen in the questionnaire shown in appendix I, \"yes\" responses were coded as \"1\" and \"no\" responses as \"2.\" Both of these relationships indicate that later graduates enter graduate programs more frequently than earlier graduates. This is quite possibly a result of the 150 hour requirement for sitting the CPA exam.\nA significant (0.031) relationship existed between responses to the type of employer for the first position and the number of times respondents changed companies. Responses were coded as:\nThat relationship indicates that graduates who were first employed by public accounting firms changed companies more often than graduates who started their careers with private firms or with the government. Often CPAs in public accounting firms accept management positions with firms that they audit with the blessing, for obvious reasons, of the public accounting firm.\nResponses to whether graduates believe their education at Marshall adequately prepared them for their career were significantly (0.000) related with whether they were satisfied with the progression of their career and with whether they would recommend the accounting program at Marshall to their children or friends (0.000 level). Again, \"yes\" responses were coded as \"1\" and \"no\" responses as \"2.\" These relationships suggest that graduates are consistent in their approval and support for the accounting program.
