DCM are traced in all three seasons (January-July), descending from near the surface (north of 31 N) to 50 m over a large extent of the transect to the south, approximately following the 24.7-25.1 isopycnals as they and the isotherms deepen to the south. In January, phytoplankton chlorophyll concentrations in the DCM are relatively uniform, originating during upwelling events that occur farther north, then following the equatorward flow of the CC. During April and July, the discrete maxima in the DCM occur at the centers of cyclonic meanders and the chlorophyll concentrations inside these maxima are enhanced as a result of local coastal upwelling off Baja California.

The California Current System (CCS) connects the SubArctic gyre in the north to the North Equatorial Current in the south [Favorite et al., 1976; Par\u00e9s-Sierra et al., 1997] . In the southern part of the California Current off Baja California, the equatorward flow takes the form of an intensified jet. The core of this jet separates from the coast and is often found 100-200 km offshore, strongest during late winter and spring. The jet often divides the inshore biologically productive waters from offshore low-production waters, creating strong mesoscale variability in the form of eddies and meanders that affect the biological productivity of the area Thomas, 2007a, 2007b] .\n[3] Physical-biological interactions in the southern CC region have been reported in numerous field studies and (more recently) analysis of satellite fields [Strub et al., 1990; Hayward et al., 1999; Bograd et al., 2000; Durazo et al., 2001; EspinosaCarreon et al., 2004; Thomas, 2007a, 2007b] . In particular, Legaard and Thomas [2007] use satellite data to describe the spatial pattern and intraseasonal variability of chlorophyll and sea surface temperature. However, papers that combine coincident satellite and in situ data are less common and we use this combination to explore the relationship between mesoscale circulation features and phytoplankton distributions, as represented by satellite and in situ chlorophyll-a concentrations.\n[4] Three processes have been suggested in the generation of meanders and eddies off Baja California: wind-forcing, instabilities of the coastal flow, and coastal geometry [Haidvogel et al., 1991; Par\u00e9s-Sierra et al., 1993; Barth et al., 2000] . The aspects of wind forcing most commonly described are coastal upwelling/downwelling due to alongshore wind stress and upwelling/downwelling in offshore regions caused by the curl of the wind stress [Chelton, 1982; Bakun and Nelson, 1991] . Upwelling is needed to increase the phytoplankton concentrations, by bringing the nutrients that originate in the deeper ocean up into the euphotic zone, where solar radiation drives photosynthesis. A third type of wind forcing that accomplishes the same result is direct wind stirring, proportional to the cube of the wind speed [Strub et al., 1990] . Dynamical instabilities that convert the linear momentum of jets into mesoscale meanders and eddies may be barotropic (due to horizontal shear of strong currents) or baroclinic (due to vertical shear and horizontal density gradients). In this region, vertical shear is created by the interaction of the equatorward surface flow of the California Current with the poleward California Undercurrent [Barth et al., 2000; Jer\u00f3nimo and G\u00f3mez-Vald\u00e9s, 2007] . Coastal geometry may be in the form of bottom bathymetry or coastline morphology (capes and bays). Simpson and Lynn [1990] have documented mesoscale structures off Baja California and suggested that the ocean's bottom bathymetry induces instabilities in the seasonal intensification of the California Undercurrent, which generates meanders and eddies that are also influenced by the geometry of the coastline [Soto-Mardones et al., 2004] .\n[5] The processes discussed above usually act in combination to create meanders and eddies on time scales of weeks to seasons. On longer time scales, Gaxiola-Castro et al. [2008] illustrate temporal links between lower trophic biological levels and physical processes in the southern region of the California Current off Baja California. They concluded that diminishing near-surface salinity and water column integrated phytoplankton biomass have been associated with variations in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO).\n[6] The year 2000 has been distinguished by the CC's strong shift in location away from the coast of Baja California, with sea surface temperatures close to the long-term mean [Bograd et al., 2000] . The main goal of this work is to characterize the effects of mesoscale processes (jets, eddies, and meanders) on surface and subsurface phytoplanktonchlorophyll distribution during three months of the 2000 year off Baja California. We utilize a combination of satellite-derived data (SSH and CHL) with field information obtained from the sea-ongoing CalCOFI (California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations) and IMECOCAL (Investigaciones Mexicanas de la Corriente de California) programs. We selected an alongshore transect located at a distance of $130 km offshore, where the transitional core of the CC is usually found, and also where field data are routinely collected by CalCOFI and IMECOCAL. One consequent research question is: Is there an association between circulation processes and water column phytoplanktonchlorophyll distributions in the CC along Baja California?"}, {"section_title": "Data and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Satellite-Derived Data", "text": "[7] High-resolution sea surface height anomalies (hereafter sea level anomalies, SLA) have been produced by (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) of the SSH at each point is subtracted to remove the unknown geoid and the mean height, creating the SLA from the SSH (see http://www.aviso. oceanobs.com) [Ducet et al., 2000; Le Traon et al., 2003] . Our time series spans from October 1992 to September 2007, and represent the updated multimission gridded product referred to as the Delayed Time maps of sea level anomaly.\n[8] To examine the representative mesoscale nature of the year 2000, we calculated the nonseasonal anomalies of the SLA data by removing the temporal mean and seasonal signal estimated from the harmonic analysis of the AVISO time series (as in the work of Espinosa-Carreon et al. [2004] ):\nwhere A 0 , A 1 , and A 2 are the temporal mean, annual amplitude, and semiannual amplitude for each time series at each pixel; x(x, y); w= 2p/365.25 is the annual radian frequency; 8 1 , 8 2 are the phases of annual and semiannual harmonics, respectively, relative to the beginning of year; and t is time. Fitted errors of amplitudes and phases (calculated as described by Beron-Vera and Ripa [2002] ) were very low in value (not shown). After removal of the temporal mean and seasonal signals, the nonseasonal sea level anomalies retain only the subseasonal and interannual variability.\n[9] Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) are calculated for the nonseasonal SLA described above. In the analysis below, results are shown only for the first EOF mode of nonseasonal SLA, which describes the most coherent pattern of the nonseasonal variance. The bimonthly Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) values (in 1/1000 of standard deviations) were obtained from http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/people/ klaus.wolter/MEI/table.html and are compared to the nonseasonal SLA EOF in Figure 2 .\n[10] To reconstruct the dynamic sea surface height (SSH), we added the long-term mean of sea surface dynamic height (calculated from the surface geopotential anomalies of the World Ocean Database 2001, WOD01) to the SLA from AVISO, using 500 dbar as reference level. The WOD01 represents the climatological, high-resolution 1/4 gridded temperature and salinity fields at standard depths [Boyer et al., 2005] and were obtained from the National Oceanographic Data Center web site (see http://www.nodc.noaa. gov). This replaces the actual mean SSH with the mean hydrographic dynamic height, converting SLA back to an estimated dynamic SSH.\n[11] SeaWiFS (Sea Viewing Wide Field of View Sensor) ocean color data (chlorophyll concentrations, CHL) were provided by A. Thomas of the University of Maine. After initial processing [Barnes et al., 1994] , the 8 day composites were remapped to 4 km resolution. Weekly CHL imagery, were obtained from December 1999 to January 2001 for the California Current region (22-33 N, 112-120 W) (Figure 1 ). From the weekly CHL and SSH data we obtained the discrete surface values for all the stations, sampled by CalCOFI and IMECOCAL programs in our study area (grids not shown). We are particularly interested in the stations numbered *0.50, which form a transect along a line parallel to the coast (located $130 km offshore) ( Figure 1 ). Finally we estimated the monthly average of the dynamic sea surface height fields, from which the surface geostrophic velocities were calculated. Dynamic SSH fields were very similar to those obtained by Strub and James [2002] ."}, {"section_title": "In Situ Data", "text": "[12] In situ temperature, salinity, and phytoplankton chlorophyll-a data were acquired from the monitoring programs of CalCOFI (stations 90.53 and 93.50; http://www. calcofi.org/data.html) and IMECOCAL (stations *0.50 from lines 100 through 137; http://imecocal.cicese.mx/) during January (14 January to 2 February), April (4 to 23 April), and July (10 to 31 July), 2000 (transect line in Figure 1 ). At each station, a CTD/Rosette cast was made to the 1000 m depth to measure pressure, temperature, and salinity. Density was determined from temperature and salinity data, following the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization [1983] and Millero and Poisson [1981] algorithms. Geostrophic velocities were calculated following Pond and Pickard [1986] , and referenced to the 500 dbar depth estimated from the geopotential anomalies.\n[13] Phytoplankton chlorophyll-a concentrations were measured from discrete water samples collected in 5 L Niskin bottles at 0, 10, 20, 50, 100, 150, 200 m depths. For chlorophyll-a analyses, 1 L of seawater was filtered onto Whatman GF/F filters and chlorophyll-a was determined by the fluorometric method [Yentsch and Menzel, 1963; Holm Hansen et al., 1965] , following Venrick and Hayward's [1984] procedure.

This EOF mode explains 35% of the nonseasonal SLA variability and represents mainly the El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a interannual events. These strongly affect the Baja California Peninsula coast, with diminishing effects offshore. The mean circulation pattern during strong interannual events consists of meandering poleward flow during El Ni\u00f1o and equatorward flow for the duration of La Ni\u00f1a. The correlation between the time series of the first EOF mode (in green) and the Multivariate ENSO index (MEI) (in blue) is significant (r = 0.56; p = 0.01). Within the context of the weak La Ni\u00f1a conditions, we examine biophysical interactions associated with mesoscale features off Baja California during January, April, and July 2000.\n[15] Dynamic height fields (SSH) in the year 2000 for January, April, and July, show mesoscale features characterized by eddies and meanders ( Figure 3 ). During January and April, the lowest dynamic SSH values (<90 cm) are observed in the northernmost part of the study area and in the coastal zone. In January, the prominent features are the extensive region of low dynamic SSH over most of the region within the persistent Southern California Bight cyclonic eddy north of 30 N, the large cyclonic eddy off Punta Eugenia (26 -28 N) , and the other mesoscale structures with low dynamic SSH extending west offshore of $24 N. In April, a low dynamic SSH feature is located north of Punta Eugenia, which appears to spread out southwestward. In the southwest corner of the region, an area with high dynamic SSH is depicted, increasing from January to July. These fields suggest an intensification of an anticyclonic eddy situated $29.0 N-116.5 W in January that moved to $29 N-118 W in April and merged with the offshore region of high dynamic SSH in July.\n[16] Chlorophyll-a monthly images for January, April, and July are shown in Figure 4 . In the north, high chlorophyll concentrations are observed offshore, advected from the north and extending farthest south (30 N) in January, representing the Ensenada Front off Baja California. In January, the cyclonic eddy located at 27 N-116 W shows an offshore chlorophyll concentration greater than 0.3 mg m \u00c03 . In the three sampled months along the transect, high chlorophyll concentrations (>0.5 mg m \u00c03 ) are inversely and significantly correlated with lower dynamic SSH values (r = \u00c00.83 for January; r = \u00c00.43 for April; r = \u00c00.61 for July). The relationship between satellite chlorophyll (mg m \u00c03 ) and geostrophic velocities (cm s \u00c01 ) are shows in Figure 4 . We can observe that the surface chlorophyll distributions are well related to the mesoscale structures.\n[17] The circulation patterns described by satellite data in Figure 3 agree in general with the more spatially limited IMECOCAL hydrographic dynamic height fields (with 500 dbar as the reference level) presented by Bograd et al. [2000] . The question is how to relate the more complete surface fields constructed from satellite data (Figure 3 and [2007a, 2007b] ) to the sparse subsurface in situ data?"}, {"section_title": "Henson and Thomas", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Mesoscale Circulation, SSH, and Chlorophyll Relationships", "text": "[18] In order to study the relationship of phytoplankton biomass to mesoscale circulation features, we use in situ and satellite-derived chlorophyll-a concentrations as proxies for phytoplankton biomass. These are compared to the ocean's mesoscale structure, as represented by satellite-derived dynamic SSH (anomalies plus mean dynamic height), and to the hydrographic distribution of water properties and geostrophic velocities along the transects shown in Figure 3 . These transect run parallel to, and approximately 130 km from the coast, mostly in the transition area between the CC core flow and the coastal upwelling zone. The in situ data along the transects help to characterize the subsurface fields associated with the surface properties sampled by the satellites.\n[19] The IMECOCAL cruises during 2000 had duration of three weeks. In our correlation analysis, we use the weekly satellite chlorophyll data that corresponds to each station's date, comparing satellite chlorophyll (CHL) to in situ data (chl) for all cruises (Lines 90 and 93 from CalCOFI and 100-137 IMECOCAL programs). Using chl (sup) to represent surface values of chl, for January our findings are: CHL versus chl (sup) [20] In January, dynamic SSH (cm) and satellite CHL concentrations (mg m \u00c03 ) show an inverse relationship (r = \u00c00.83; p < 0.05) along the transect line (Figure 5a ). Within the water column, the vertically integrated chlorophyll concentrations (0-100 m, in mg m \u00c02 ) remain nearly constant at $40 mg m \u00c02 , except for a drop to $20 mg m \u00c02 at the most southern stations (130-137, Figure 5a ). Comparing dynamic SSH and cross-transect velocities, dynamic SSH minima at stations 100-103 and 123-127 fall inside cyclonic eddies, while the dynamic SSH maxima at stations 107-117 fall inside an anticyclonic eddy, as depicted by the geostrophic dynamics (Figures 3a, 5a and 5c ). [21] Distributions of isothermals ( Figure 5b ) and isopycnals (Figure 5f ) along the transect show a gradual deepening toward the south, as expected when moving toward warmer (subtropical) water masses. Isohalines also deepen slightly toward the south until stations 117-120, where they shoal abruptly (Figure 5d ), indicating the transition from subarctic to more saline subtropical water masses. The crosssection geostrophic current flow depicts two cyclones centered at stations 100 and 123 (Figure 5c ), separated by an anticyclonic eddy that crosses the transect line at stations 107-117 (Figure 3a) . The current flow inside the cyclones is offshore in the north and onshore in the south of each cyclonic eddy center.\n[22] In spite of the presence of mesoscale structures along this section, the integrated in situ chlorophyll signal shows little variability in Figure 5a , while the satellite-derived chlorophyll appears more responsive. This is explained by the chlorophyll section in Figure 5e , which reveals chlorophyll maxima (0.4-0.6 mg m"}, {"section_title": "\u00c03", "text": ") that deepen from near the surface at the north, to $50 m depth between stations 107-127. The integration from 0 to 100 m captures all of this DCM (Deep Chlorophyll Maximum) at each station, despite its changing depth. This creates a nearly uniform integrated values of $40 mg m \u00c02 at all stations except along the southern end of the transect, where the subsurface maximum disappears.\n[23] The satellite's CHL color sensor only detects the first optical depth of the upper water column, which is shallower for higher subsurface concentrations. While it is able to see the enhanced near-surface chlorophyll maximum of 0.6-0.8 mg m are being advected offshore by the northern branch of the cyclonic eddy located between stations 90-107. The circulation pattern depicted by the southern cyclonic eddy (station 123, Figure 3a) produces a vertical distribution of chlorophyll that is different from the northern chlorophyll vertical distribution at $50 m, the higher-subsurface values of chlorophyll concentration located at the center of the cyclonic eddy (between stations 120-127) are moving offshore in the northern half of the eddy and onshore in the southern half of the eddy. Note that there is no value of integrated in situ chlorophyll-a at station 123 (Figure 5a ), so the apparent separation of the subsurface maxima at stations 120 and 127 is an artifact of the contouring routine.\n[24] Figures 6 and 7 show the distributions of the same variables as presented in Figure 5 , but for the transects sampled in April and July, respectively. In April, the in situ integrated chlorophyll-a values display an inverse relationship to the dynamic SSH values (Figure 6a ). The integrated chlorophyll-a maxima are caused by the discrete maxima in the DCM values at stations 100 and 113-120 (Figures 6a   and 6e ). These stations correspond exactly to the minima in the dynamic SSH (Figure 6a) , also depicted by the zero lines in the cross-sectional geostrophic velocity (Figure 6c) . Thus, these maxima in the DCM are inside the strongest cyclonic meanders along the section (also confirmed in Figure 3b ).\n[25] The difference between April and January is that the DCM is not continuous in April; instead it is confined to the cyclonic meanders. Note that although there are no in situ chlorophyll-a data at station 107 in April (Figure 6a ), the low values at the neighboring stations 110 and 103 confirm the diminished values of the subsurface chlorophyll-a core under the anticyclone and the lack of a continuous DCM. The satellite CHL are relatively low everywhere south of station 100, but they do show a relative maximum at station 117, located at the center of the southernmost DCM.\n[26] The surface and subsurface chlorophyll-a fields from July show similar patterns to those of April from station 100 to the south, except that the isolated DCM cores are at stations 103 and 120 and the values are much higher than in [28] Lynn and Simpson [1987] state that the strongest CC equatorward flow is present in spring and summer, whereas the strongest poleward coastal counterflow (the Inshore Countercurrent, IC) is most evident during fall and winter. During our short period of study, monthly dynamic SSH data do not show poleward flow in January nor an increase in equatorward CC flow from January to April (both periods have very similar current patterns in Figures 3a and 3b ). This may indicate that the IC is inshore of the domain of the maps, i.e., in coastal areas not resolved by the altimeter dynamic surface height. During spring and summer the highest CC flow velocities are associated with the seasonal maxima of the pycnocline tilt [Collins et al., 2003; Pennington et al., 2009] . Durazo et al. [2010] show that the region north of Punta Eugenia (28 N) is influenced by SubArtic Water (SAW) all year, while the southern region is influenced by Transitional Surface Water (TSW) and Subtropical Surface Water (StSW), mainly during summer and autumn. These two water masses were present in our results during July, associated with the large high-SSH area that occupies almost half of the southwestern portion of our study area.\n) occurs north of the Ensenada Front. During July (summer), local coastal upwelling processes reach their maximum intensity [Zaytsev et al., 2003] and the surface geostrophic currents move offshore, developing smaller-scale meanders. At this time, chlorophyll-a concentrations increase to > 2 mg m \u00c03 in the DCM, inshore of the cyclonic meandering jet, although the satellitederived CHL barely detects these DCM values. The Ensenada Front is more evident, with high chlorophyll concentrations ($0.8 mg m\n) at the north of the front attributed to nutrient-rich waters [Gaxiola-Castro and Alvarez Borrego, 1991] that are upwelled farther north and advected southward by the CC flow.\n[36] Off central California, sea surface water transported along the core of the CC shows lower nutrient concentrations than the locally upwelled waters. This allows the upwelled, high-phytoplankton biomass to be clearly seen in satellite images, as it extends offshore [Chavez et al., 2002] . This has also been seen off Baja California, in a narrow region within 50 km off the coast (data not shown). In the case of the transects used in our study (located at $130 km offshore), the high chlorophyll-a concentrations were usually observed at subsurface depths and satellite-derived CHL data registered relatively uniform, low concentrations.\n[37] These results are consistent with the findings of Espinosa-Carreon et al. [2004] , who determined that for the same study area there is not a clear relationship between satellite-derived CHL and SSH cyclonic eddies. The authors propose that the offshore surface nutrients are depleted by phytoplankton, creating a nutricline that is too deep to allow nutrients to be raised by cyclonic eddies into the euphotic zone. The results of our study reveal that the relationships between satellite values of CHL and SSH can be misleading or difficult to interpret, without the companionship of the subsurface distributions of chlorophyll-a and velocities within the water column."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "[29] Soto-Mardones et al. [2004] describe mesoscale structures during 2000 off Baja California, using ADCP currents and hydrographic data from the IMECOCAL observations. In their analyses, the spring circulation was more uniform and without eddies, except for a meander located off Punta Eugenia. Using the finer spatial resolution of the satellite data, we verify that this meander is a portion of a cyclonic eddy extending offshore. Soto-Mardones et al. [2004] explained the generation and propagation of eddies at 28.5 N from January 2000 to July 2001, following the displacement of a cyclonic eddy that was originally situated off Punta Eugenia. Goerike et al. [2004] established that quarterly observations in the California Current are appropriate to delineate the effects of the major ocean climate events in this region. Despite the fact that there is not a distinctive seasonal periodicity in eddy generation off Baja California, we suggest that the lower SSH area situated at $24.5 N-117.5 W in January has moved to 26.5 N-119.0 W in April, while a water mass with high SSH develops in the southwestern corner of our domain (Figure 3 ). The summer season is characterized by the presence of small eddies close to the coastal region, which interact with the equatorward CC flow and with the TSW and StSW in the southern region. Previous studies by Durazo and Baumgartner [2002] Durazo et al. [2010] and others have shown vertical sections of temperature, salinity, potential density, velocity and spiciness along lines perpendicular to coast in the IMECOCAL region. The alongshore transect examined here lies in the transitional zone, which divides the coastal zone from the oceanic zones, and is characterized by strong mesoscale structures. This zone has also been described by Lynn and Simpson [1987] and has been used by Mart\u00ednez-Gaxiola et al. [2010] as the offshore boundary to estimate the geostrophic transport of phosphates in an area extending from Ensenada to Punta Eugenia. Our emphasis is different from the above studies in that we use the alongshore transect to characterize the subsurface fields associated with the surface properties observed by the satellites.\n[30] Soto-Mardones et al. [2004] show that the offshore Ekman transport in the study region increases the equatorward flow and changes the structure of eddies and meanders, reinforcing the circulation in the eastern branch of an anticyclonic eddy and in the western part of a cyclonic eddy. This can be seen in the westward flow near stations 117-127 ( Figure 5c ) and in the boundaries between the anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies located at the end of the transect (Figure 3a) . Again, the horizontal 2-D surfaces fields from the satellite and the vertical 2-D subsurface transects provide complementary information.\n[31] From the January results, we propose the following interpretation of the processes controlling phytoplankton distributions: (1) The 2-D surface fields in Figure 3a shows that the transect depicted in Figure 5 cuts through a field composed mainly of mesoscale meanders and eddies; (2) The surface CHL concentrations are representative (r = 0.37; p < 0.05) of the pattern of the in situ surface chlorophyll-a concentrations (although lower in magnitude); but they do not represent (r = \u00c00.50; p < 0.05) the relatively uniform amounts of integrated chlorophyll-a pigment in the upper 100 m; (3) In the north, the strong covariability between high values of satellite-derived CHL and gradients of satellite-derived SSH in Figure 5a could be interpreted to indicate a greater offshore transport of phytoplankton in the northern half of the eddy than onshore transport in the southern half of the cyclonic eddy; (4) The in situ measurements in Figure 5c , however, indicate that the onshore transport of phytoplankton in the southern half of the eddy may be similar in magnitude to the offshore transport, differing only in the depth of the returning phytoplankton (which is misinterpreted in the satellite data); (5) Likewise, higher values (>0.6 mg m \u00c03 ) of chlorophyll-a concentrations are also found in the subsurface (50 m) maximum at the center of the southern cyclonic eddy in the in situ section, which are only weakly detected in the satellite CHL field (not significant at p < 0.05); (6) The higher chlorophyll values on the inshore side of the equatorward flow around the southern cyclonic eddy (Figures 4 and 5) suggest that phytoplankton biomass has increased due to coastal upwelling entrainment, similar to the situation found in the CC farther north by numerous authors [Brink and Cowles,1991] ; (7) The vertical sections show a gradual deepening toward the south of isotherms, along with a deepening of the subsurface chlorophyll maximum (with values of >0.4 mg m \u00c03 ), which approximately follows the 24.7-25.1 isopycnals; (8) Salinity distributions along the section are consistent with the equatorward CC flow of SubArctic Water (SAW) in the north, with an abrupt shoaling of isohalines at stations 117-120, indicating the influence of the TSW and StSW south of Punta Eugenia .\n[32] The 2-D satellite-derived SSH and surface velocity fields in Figure 3c provide an explanation for the differences observed in the results of July from those of January and April. First, the spatial scales of the meanders are shorter in July than in January and April. The alternating onshore and offshore bands of currents in Figure 7c between stations 100-107 are barely captured by the station's transects. Second, the meandering jet has moved further offshore in July (Figure 3c ) and the transect itself lies along the inshore boundary of the mesoscale features, missing their peaks and troughs.\n[33] With regard to the north-south gradients in the chlorophyll-a, temperature, salinity and density fields, the pattern seen in January is generally repeated in April and July: Isotherms and isopycnals deepen to the south, while isohalines shoal abruptly between stations 117-120. Salinities greater than 33.8 and an increase in temperature of the upper ocean (of $0.3 C) indicate the presence of the TSW (Transitional Surface Water) and StSW (Subtropical Surface Water) south of Punta Eugenia. SAW (SubArtic Water) characteristics (subsurface salinity minima <33.5) are evident both north and south of Punta Eugenia. The DCM near 50 m, following the 24.7-25.1 isopycnal, also indicates the presence of SAW in the core of the CC, as it continues equatorward.\n[34] The other common feature in all three months is the northern maxima of satellite CHL ( . This may represent the seasonal variability of the Ensenada Front, describing richer CC water to the north and more oligotrophic subtropical water to the south of the front [Pel\u00e1ez and McGowan, 1986; Espinosa-Carreon et al., 2004] . The integrated chlorophyll-a values and the subsurface chlorophyll-a transects in Figures 5-7 show that high chlorophyll-a pigment concentrations are also found south of the Ensenada Front next to the coast within the equatorward meanders jet. However, the high chlorophyll values only appear in the DCM ($50 m depth), producing a signal of only $0.1 mg m \u00c03 in the satellite-derived CHL. Subsurface values increase to >1.0 mg m \u00c03 in April and >2.0 mg m \u00c03 in July. Due to the seasonal increases in upwellingfavorable winds [Soto-Mardones et al., 2004] , we suggest that the high values of chlorophyll-a concentrations in the DCM are an indication of local wind-driven coastal upwelling, resulting in nearshore phytoplankton blooms that are entrained into the inshore side of the expanding equatorward jet, subducting with the $24.7-25.1 isopycnal to form the DCM.\n[35] The data presented above demonstrate that mesoscale cyclonic eddies and meanders with low dynamic SSH anomalies off Baja California are not necessarily always associated with high chlorophyll-a concentrations (in the surface or subsurface). The existences of a strong equatorward CC flow with coastal wind-driven upwelling events help establish a good correspondence between chlorophyll concentrations and mesoscale circulation features. These conditions are not found during January (winter), when the CC flow is weak [Lynn and Simpson, 1987] and the biological signal along our transects shows a weak DCM ($0.4-0.6 mg m \u00c03 ), characteristic of a mesotrophic ecosystem [Kahru and Mitchell, 2002; Gaxiola-Castro et al., 2010] . In April (spring), the CC flow increases and the coastal upwelling system is amplified [Espinosa-Carreon et al., 2004; Durazo et al., 2010] , promoting a strengthened biological response. Chlorophyll-a pigment concentrations reach $1.0 mg m \u00c03 (eutrophic conditions) in the DCM at 50 m depth. Still, the only high satellite-derived CHL signal (>0.4 mg m"}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "[38] Satellite-derived SSH and CHL are combined with subsurface in situ data collected along a transect located 130 km offshore, parallel to the coast of Baja California (Figure 1) , to describe the mesoscale processes that affect phytoplankton distributions during January, April, and July 2000. Meanders and eddies were observed in this region during the three sampling months, their velocity distributions were well depicted in the surface (by the satellite-derived SSH dynamic fields) and in the water column (by the geopotential anomalies) (Figures 3, 4 , 5, 6, and 7). On the other hand, the biological response to mesoscale processes of the satellite-derived chlorophyll (CHL) is more difficult to interpret due to changes in the phytoplankton vertical distribution. North of 31 N, CHL values were moderately high (0.4-0.8 mg m \u00c03 ) in all three months, dropping to 0.2-0.4 mg m \u00c03 south of 31 N. Subsurface chlorophyll-a concentrations produce a Deep Chlorophyll Maxima (DCM), with higher values at the center of the two cyclonic eddies, after the onset of an upwelling event in April and July. In January, there is a more uniform DCM, creating nearly constant values of integrated chlorophyll-a concentrations. Values in the DCM increase from January (0.4-0.6 mg m \u00c03 ) to April (>1.0 mg m \u00c03 ) to July (>2.0 mg m \u00c03 ).\n[39] In January we interpret the moderate chlorophyll-a concentrations values in the DCM to indicate a general inflow from the north, from upwelling off California and advection of phytoplankton equatorward by the CC. The influence of this equatorward flow continues to create a moderate surface chlorophyll-a concentrations north of 31 N during April and July, while local wind-driven upwelling causes phytoplankton blooms and high chlorophyll-a concentrations inshore of the meandering jet. The later increases its strength between winter and spring and then moves offshore in the summer. The blooms created by the coastal upwelling spread offshore, depleting surface nutrients and subducting along the 24.7-25.1 isopycnals, creating the DCM along the inner part of the meandering jet.\n[40] Subsurface data are necessary to fully describe the bio-physical interactions between chlorophyll concentrations and the mesoscale features observed in the SSH. Our study reveals that the relationships between satellite values of CHL and SSH can be misleading or difficult to interpret, without the addition of subsurface distributions of chlorophyll-a and velocities within the water column. Subsurface data also document the influence of the Subarctic Water mass at the north of our study area and the Subtropical Surface Water mass south of Punta Eugenia.\n[41] Acknowledgments.
