An abundance of research has sought to solve this enigma, much of it centered on the incentive structure facing administrators. Some recent papers use TIMSS data to analyze the relationship between institutional arrangements-that typically do not vary within a single country-and student achievement. Similarly, we utilize TIMSS 1999 to determine if there is an indirect relationship between institutional arrangements and student achievement, via a relationship with school efficiency. Our results show that the specified link between institutional arrangements and student achievement (direct or indirect) is important in certain instances and confirm evidence found in previous research that certain arrangements are beneficial or detrimental to student achievement, regardless of the specification chosen."}, {"section_title": "", "text": ". Obviously policymakers in this country believe that increased educational funding will lead to increased school quality (student achievement). Alas, student achievement has not shown any improvement over the past several decades [2, 3] . Research on the impact of so-called school inputs (i.e. teacher education, teacher salaries, etc.) has resulted in scant evidence of a link between these inputs and student achievement. Hanushek [4] sums up this literature by saying, \"A wide range of analyses indicate that overall resource policies have not led to discernible improvements in student performance.\"\nIn response to the lack of a significant relationship between school resources and student performance, many researchers have directed their attention toward the incentives faced by school teachers and administrators. A common conclusion is that schools are plagued by inefficiency, and that inefficiency will persist until the incentive structure is altered [4] [5] [6] . Studies analyzing inefficiency in public schools have been able to locate the missing relationship between school resources and student performance [7, 8] . Additionally, Collier and Millimet [9] find some evidence to support the notion that increased competition leads to increased efficiency in public schools, but only in districts that operate in financially flexible environments. Duncombe et al. [10] use Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and report lower levels of cost efficiency in *Address correspondence to this author at the Department of Economics and Finance, University of Dayton, 300 College Park, Dayton, OH, 45469, USA; Tel: 937-229-5302; Fax: 937-229-2477; E-mail: collier@udayton.edu districts facing greater competition as measured by private school enrollment.\nThe large majority of the research on education focuses on data collected within the United States. There are plenty of exceptions to this rule [11, 12] ; however, even less research has included data collected from multiple countries. A number of recent papers have used the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), an international project that collects data every four years on: student achievement scores, family background, class, school, and country characteristics [3, 9, [13] [14] [15] .\nWoessman [15] , in a seminal paper using data from TIMSS 1995, finds that the following institutional characteristics have significant positive impacts on student achievement: central examinations, centralized control mechanisms in curricular and budgetary affairs, school autonomy in process and personnel decisions, individual teachers having both incentives and powers to select appropriate teaching methods, limited influence of teachers' unions, scrutiny of students' educational performance, encouragement of parents to take interest in teaching matters, and intermediate level of administration performing administrative tasks and educational funding, and competition from privately managed schools. His research shows that a combination of all positive influencing institutional arrangements leads to a test-score increase of almost two standard deviations (ceteris paribus) over the least conducive arrangement.\nSimilarly, Collier and Millimet [9] take a distributional approach, testing the institutional arrangements using quantile treatment effects, and find that many of the conditional mean results in Woessman [15] do not hold for the entire distribution of student test scores.\nThe drawback to Collier and Millimet [9] and Woessman [15] is that they allow only for a direct relationship between the institutional characteristics and student test scores. From a theoretical standpoint, it is more likely that the institutional arrangements have an indirect relationship with student achievement. Following this same logic, Dustmann et al. [16] analyzed the impact of class size in secondary school on earnings later in life using data from England. While previous studies have failed to uncover any relationship between measures of school quality and subsequent labor market outcomes, the authors did find a positive impact by specifying the exact linkage. Specifically, the authors hypothesized that secondary school class size affects the probability of attending college and college attendance affects subsequent earnings. The data supported the hypothesis. Thus, the authors were able to establish a relationship between secondary school quality and earnings through the utilization of a two-step modeling approach.\nThis paper adds to the literature in two ways: (i) provides another analysis using cross-country data and (ii) analyzes the way in which institutional factors enter the educational production function (i.e. directly or indirectly via an association with efficiency). This relationship will be tested by estimating efficiency at the school level; and then estimating the relationship, if any, of the institutional arrangements with this efficiency. These results are compared to the results using a standard ordinary least squares model (OLS) with the institutional arrangements included as regressors.\nMany of the institutional arrangements tested here are found to have different coefficient estimates across the two models utilized. However, in none of these instances do the signs of the coefficients differ and hold statistical significance. The differences that do exist could be an indication that the true relationship between these institutional arrangements and student achievement is actually an indirect one; via a relationship with school efficiency. These differences could also result simply from a mis-specification of either model. Further research is needed to confirm the appropriate relationship. This paper does confirm the results of some of the previous research on institutional arrangements in education. Consistent with Collier and Millimet [9] and Woessman [15] , we find that school autonomy in purchasing supplies has a positive relationship with student achievement and efficiency, and that teachers' unions having a large influence on curriculum is associated with lower levels of student achievement and school efficiency [9, 15] .\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as the following. Section 2 describes the estimation techniques used herein. Section 3 gives an overview of the data. Section 4 discusses the results. Section 5 concludes."}, {"section_title": "METHODOLOGY", "text": "A two-stage model will be used to test whether the institutional arrangements discussed in this paper have any association with efficiency in schools. The first-stage entails estimation of school level efficiency; the second-stage analyzes the relationships between institutional characteristics and efficiency. Each stage is discussed in turn."}, {"section_title": "Efficiency Estimation", "text": "The panel data production function estimator of Schmidt and Sickles [17] is used to estimate the school level efficiency. The panel data production function estimator is very appealing, given that it reduces to the standard fixed effects linear regression model. Alternative approaches exist, including nonparametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and maximum likelihood stochastic frontier models. DEA models are criticized for their inability to account for stochastic error. Maximum likelihood models assume a parametric distribution for the inefficiency term (usually half-normal or exponential), and require the inefficiency to be independent across observations, as well as uncorrelated with the choice of inputs. Monte Carlo simulations have shown the maximum likelihood models to be outperformed by both DEA and the panel data production function estimator. Additionally, the assumption of an inefficiency term that is uncorrelated with the choice of inputs could be problematic in answering the research question of this paper.\nThe production function for student achievement can be written as\nwhere y isk is a measure of student achievement for student i in school s in country k, x isk is a vector of inputs, u sk is the level of technical inefficiency in school s in country k, and isk represents purely idiosyncratic shocks which are uncorrelated with the choice of inputs. Consistent with the interpretation of u as an inefficiency term, it is assumed that u sk >0 for all s, k.\nGrouping the intercept and the technical inefficiency term, equation (1) may be re-written as y isk = ( -u sk ) + x isk + isk = sk + x isk + isk (2) Given the above assumption concerning the error term, , equation (2) may be estimated using the standard fixed effects (`within') estimator. Estimates of u sk that are strictly non-negative are then given by the deviation between each school-specific intercept and the maximum intercept:\nBy construction, the most efficient class is deemed completely efficient. The technical efficiency measure used in the second-stage analysis (discussed in the next section) is defined as te sk = exp( u sk ) , which is bound by zero and unity. As shown in Schmidt and Sickles [17] , te sk provides a consistent estimate of te sk as N,T . In the present context N refers to the number of schools, and T refers to the number of students in each school.\nTwo potential drawbacks to the Schmidt and Sickles [17] approach have been documented in the literature, and are worth mentioning. First, technical inefficiency, u, is assumed to be invariant across students in the same school. Second, all heterogeneity across observations is counted as inefficiency. In other words, excluding the inefficiency term in equation (1) there is no other source of individual heterogeneity. The former is not problematic in the present context; it would make little sense for a school to have differing efficiency levels across its students. However, the latter drawback is somewhat problematic in this instance, because of the limited number of variables that vary within a school."}, {"section_title": "Determinants of Efficiency", "text": "The second-stage estimation of the determinants of efficiency uses a standard ordinary least squares approach. The technical efficiency estimated in the first stage is now regressed on different institutional arrangements to find their association, if any, with efficiency. The estimated equation for school-level efficiency is\nwhere te sk is the technical efficiency measure from the first stage at the school-level, z sk _ is a vector of institutional arrangements at the school-level, is the parameter of interest, as it represents the slope estimates on the institutional arrangements, and sk represents measurement error due to the need to estimate technical efficiency.\nAlthough the efficiency estimates are regressed on an extensive set of institutional arrangements, it is possible that there are other unobservables that affect efficiency. Due to a lack of sufficient instrumental variables, this problem is unavoidable in the present context. As a result, these findings may only be identifying correlations and not causal relationships; nonetheless, the results are important for comparison to Woessman [15] ."}, {"section_title": "Ordinary Least Squares", "text": "Finally, we also estimate a standard educational production function using an ordinary least squares model (OLS) with the institutional arrangements included as regressors.

TIMSS 1999 contains student, teacher and school background information across 38 different countries. The database includes responses of students, teachers and school principals on background questionnaires, as well as student achievement scores on internationally comparable math and science exams. The TIMSS 1999 dataset targeted \"students enrolled in the upper of the two adjacent grades that contain the largest proportion of 13-year olds at the time of testing\" [18] . The student background questionnaires contain information on family background (such as parents' levels of education, and household composition), student demographics, and classroom activities. The teacher background questionnaire provides information on the teacher (such as age, gender, experience and education), the class (such as its size), the teacher's responsibilities (such as purchasing supplies and hiring teachers), and the availability of materials. The principal background questionnaire includes information on the school's characteristics, its degree of centralization in decision-making, and its distribution of responsibilities for a number of tasks.\nMany of the questionnaire responses were transformed into categorical variables for the analysis. Further, the original database includes a number of students, teachers and principals that are missing responses, either because they failed to answer the questions, or because they were not administered the questions. This missing data would severely diminish the size of the data set, so the procedure detailed in Woessman [15] is followed to impute missing variables in the TIMSS 1999 data. Finally, we incorporate additional information from the World Education Indicators (WEI) 1999 a dataset collected jointly by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) on per capita gross domestic product (GDP) and educational expenditures per student in each country. 2 Data on GDP per capita and educational expenditures per student were not available for every country, so we are left with 28 countries and a total pool of over 120,000 individual students. From this full sample, we also estimate comparisons with sub-samples of countries that (i) are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and (ii) have curriculum-based external exit exams (CBEEEs).\nOur measures of student achievement come from the mathematics and science scores of students who were administered proficiency tests as a part of the TIMSS survey.\nThe tests were a combination of multiple choice and open response questions, where a considerable degree of care was placed on making the tests internationally comparable across languages and cultures. 3 An extensive set of individual, class, and teacher characteristics available from the TIMSS data are used to obtain the technical efficiency measures. Specifically, the vector x in (1) includes the following (in addition to a constant term):\nIndividual: age, a gender dummy, and a dummy for whether the student was born in the country of current residence;\nFamily: two dummies for the highest level of education of the student's parents (at least a secondary education and at least a university education, versus not having a secondary education), a dummy for whether both parents were born in the country, four dummies for the number of books in the student's home (1-10 books, 11-25 books, 26-100 books, and 101-200 books, versus having more than 200 books), and a dummy for whether the student resides with both parents;"}, {"section_title": "Class: class size;", "text": "Teacher: age, a gender dummy, years of teaching experience, three dummies indicating the highest level of education (a secondary degree, a bachelor's degree, and a master's degree or higher, versus not having a secondary degree);\nAdditionally, institutional characteristics from the TIMSS data and country specific variables from WEI are used in the second-stage analysis.

The F-test of the joint significance of the interaction terms in the translog model rejects the restrictions imposed in the Cobb-Douglas form at the p<0.05 confidence level. Despite this, the results are similar to those in the translog models and are not discussed here for the sake of brevity, but are available from the author upon request. The first-stage translog production function estimates are shown in Table 1 . The table includes four estimates; one each for math and science scores using the OLS model of equation (5) and one each for math and science scores using the fixed effects model shown in equation (1) . There are 170 interaction terms used in the translog model, but these are suppressed in the tables. They are available from the author upon request. The first-stage results are not the main focus of this paper; however, it is important to note that the only variable that is significant in the fixed effects model for both math and science is the student's age. This is obviously specific to the student, and thus outside the control of school administrators. This finding is consistent which Hanushek's review of the education literature, which concludes that observable school inputs do not matter.\nThe focus of this paper is to compare the results of allowing institutional arrangements to impact educational achievement directly with the results of forcing the institutional arrangements to impact education achievement indirectly through a relationship with school-level efficiency. Thus, although the OLS model includes all the inputs of the fixed effects model, plus the institutional arrangements, we break up the results of the OLS model into two tables. Table  1 , as discussed above, includes the same inputs included in the fixed effects model. Table 2 includes the coefficient estimated on the institutional arrangements from the OLS model and the coefficient estimated on the institutional arrangements from the regression on school-level efficiency (equation (4)).\nAs you can see from Table 2 , the sign of the coefficient estimates are the same across the two models for all of the institutional variables, except for teachers being held responsible for deciding the school budget in science. The level of statistical significance of the estimates does vary some across the two models; however, it is not clear which specification is more accurate."}, {"section_title": "Baseline Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Distribution of Responsibility", "text": "The responsibility for certain actions is divided between the schools being held responsible, the teachers being held responsible, or someone outside of the school holding the responsibility. The models analyzed here include dummy variables indicating that schools are responsible or teachers are responsible. Consonant with the literature, it is hypothesized that decentralization of decision-making authority leads to gains in efficiency in educational production if schools and teachers can make more informed decisions due to community specific information [19, 20] .\n"}, {"section_title": "Responsibility for Hiring Teachers", "text": "The school dummy has a positive coefficient for hiring teachers in both math and science and in both the direct OLS and indirect efficiency models. However, these coefficient estimates are statistically significant at the 1% level in both math and science fixed effects models, whereas they are statistically insignificant in both math and science OLS models. The coefficients on the dummy for teachers holding this responsibility are negative, but not statistically significant in any of the subject and model combinations. These results suggest that giving schools the responsibility for hiring teachers is associated with higher levels of efficiency, as compared with the responsibility lying with teachers or someone outside of the school. This result is similar to the finding in Woessman [15] that students in schools who are given the autonomy over hiring decisions score significantly higher on math and science tests. Vegas [21] finds that decentralization of decision-making authority has a positive impact on student achievement. This would coincide with schools and/or teachers having responsibility for hiring teachers (and the other responsibilities discussed in this paper) as opposed to someone outside of the school holding the responsibility. The coefficient on the school dummy for hiring teachers in the fixed effects models ranges in size from 0.0121 to 0.0174, meaning that schools that have autonomy in hiring teachers are 1.21 to 1.74 percent more efficient than schools without this autonomy.\nThe sub-sample results show drastic changes in the coefficient estimates on the dummies for schools and teachers holding the responsibility for hiring teachers. When we limit the sample to countries within the OECD, the OLS estimates in both math and science on the dummy for schools being responsible for hiring teachers switch signs from the full sample results to negative coefficient estimates; only the math result is statistically significant. The fixed effect estimate in math on the dummy for schools being responsible for hiring teachers is virtually indifferent between the full sample and OECD sub-sample, but the science estimate in the OECD sub-sample becomes negative (but statistically insignificant), whereas it was positive in the full sample.\nThe OLS and fixed effects coefficient estimates in science on the dummy for teachers being responsible for hiring teachers remain negative (as they were in the full sample) in the OECD sub-sample, but also become statistically significant. In math, this OLS estimate also becomes statistically significant, but the fixed effect estimate remains positive and statistically insignificant.\nThe coefficient estimates on the dummies for both schools and teachers holding the responsibility for hiring teachers are negative across both subjects and both models in the CBEEE sub-sample, with the coefficient estimates on the dummy for teacher responsibility holding statistical significance. These changes in the coefficient estimates between the full sample and the CBEEE sub-sample are similar to the findings in Woessman [26] and Fuchs and Woessman [20] that there is strong heterogeneity for the effects of school autonomy."}, {"section_title": "Responsibility for Deciding School Budget", "text": "The school dummy for deciding the school budget has positive coefficients in math and science in both models; however, they are only statistically significant in the OLS models.

The coefficients on the teacher dummies in science with the CBEEE sub-sample remain positive and statistically significant in both models, as they were in the full sample. This suggests that the optimal level of responsibility for purchasing supplies is highly dependent on other factors, including the subject and the presence of CBEEEs.

Additionally, this is also consistent with the hypothesis formed in Bishop and Woessman [19] and Fuchs and Woessman [20] , that decentralization in decision-making increases educational efficiency. Although, in this instance it appears that decentralization to the school level is beneficial, decentralization to the teacher level may be detrimental.

Thus, the relationship between teachers influencing textbook choice and school efficiency is unclear.\nPolicy Implications: teachers should have a strong influence over the kind of supplies used in the classroom, but they should not have a strong influence over the subject matter taught.\nThe coefficient estimates on the dummy for teachers having a large influence on the choice of textbook are positive and statistically significant in the OECD sub-sample models using OLS for both subjects and using fixed effects in science. Both models result in positive coefficients with the CBEEE sub-sample for science, but negative coefficients for this sub-sample in math. It appears that the effects of giving teachers a large influence over the textbook is largely dependent on subject, whether or not the country has curriculum based external exit exams and other unobservable factors in OECD countries.\nPolicy Implications: teachers should have a large influence over the kind of supplies and textbook used in science classes in OECD countries."}, {"section_title": "Country Specifics", "text": "The following are country-level variables thought to impact efficiency in education.

In science, this coefficient estimate is positive using OLS, but negative using fixed effects; neither of these estimates are statistically significant. The result in math is opposite of the positive and statistically significant relationship between GDP per capita and test scores found in Woessman [15] . It could be that students in countries with higher standards of living (as measured by GDP per capita) have less of an incentive to do well in school. This is likely just an association, not a causal finding.\nThe coefficient estimate on a country's GDP per capita in science is negative and statistically significant using both models for the OECD sub-sample. This result could be due to the fact that OECD countries have higher GDP per capita in general, but clearly does not indicate that countries should try to lower their GDP per capita in an attempt to increase academic success. The remaining sub-sample estimates for GDP per capita are largely statistically insignificant and mostly uninteresting."}, {"section_title": "Expenditures Per Student", "text": "The variable measuring the level of expenditures per student in a country has positive and statistically significant coefficients in both subjects using both models. This is similar to the finding in Millimet and Collier [25] of robust efficiency spillovers across school districts in the same county, only when the district operates in a financially flexible environment\nThe variable measuring the level of expenditures per student in a country has negative coefficients in all of the sub-sample estimates using the fixed effects model; including the CBEEE sub-sample estimate in science, which is statistically significant. This is in contrast to the positive and statistically significant findings for the full sample. The OLS sub-sample results are all positive, while the fixed effects sub-sample results are all negative. Thus, it could be that more spending on education is beneficial to student achievement, but that this spending is often inefficient. This also shows that there may be unobservable factors in OECD countries and other important characteristics of some countries (e.g. the presence CBEEEs) that play an important role in educational production function modeling."}, {"section_title": "Sensitivity Analysis", "text": "To assess the sensitivity of our baseline results, we reconducted our analysis using two different sub-samples of the data:\nOECD Only: using only students from member countries of the OECD; and (ii) CBEEE Only: using only students from countries that have curriculum-based external exit exams (CBEEEs).\nThe results of the analysis using only students from member countries of the OECD are displayed in Tables 3  and 4 .

Unfortunately, researchers have found scant evidence of factors within the control of policymakers that can increase student achievement. In fact, significant increases in per pupil expenditures in the United States over recent decades have not lead to any discernible increases in student test scores over the same period. Following the work of Woessman [15] and Collier and Millimet [9] , this paper seeks to further our knowledge of the effects of institutional characteristics that may not vary within the United States. The TIMSS 1999 dataset (a compilation of over 120,000 students from 28 countries) is analyzed to determine whether an indirect relationship exists between institutional arrangements and student test scores, via a relationship with educational efficiency. This paper uses two different educational models; one, ordinary least squares, includes the institutional characteristics as variables that directly influence student achievement; the other, a fixed effects model, first estimates the level of efficiency in each school then estimates the relationship between the institutional characteristics and school efficiency. Differences in the coefficient estimates of institutional characteristics between the two models are minimal, but do exist. The coefficients on: schools holding the responsibility for hiring teachers and determining teachers' salaries, and teachers holding a large influence on money for supplies are all statistically significant in the fixed effects model, but not so in the OLS model for both math and science. The opposite, statistical significance in the OLS model, is true of teachers individually influencing the curriculum in both math and science. In none of these instances do the signs of the coefficients differ and hold statistical significance. Thus, differences do result from using the two models, but it is not clear which model is necessarily preferred. This analysis does provide robust estimates for some institutional arrangements with consistent coefficient estimates across both models in both subjects. Our results suggest that: both teachers and schools holding the responsibility for purchasing supplies, subject teachers holding a strong influence over the curriculum and teachers having a strong influence over the kind of supplies used in the classroom are all positively associated with student achievement and school efficiency. Teachers' unions and teachers holding a strong influence over the subject matter are both negatively associated with student achievement and school efficiency.\nOur specification analysis using sub-samples of the full data suggest that there are important differences in OECD and non-OECD countries that are not attributable to observable institutional arrangements. Additionally, curriculum-based external exit exams (CBEEEs) appear to have an important impact not only on student achievement, but also on the relationship between institutional arrangements and student achievement. Similar to Woessman [26] , we find differing relationships between some of our institutional arrangements and school efficiency (as well as student achievement) between countries with and without CBEEEs.\nDespite the differences between our approach and Woessman's [15] approach, it is clear that institutional arrangements are significantly related to educational production. Consistent findings across Woessman [15] , Collier and Millimet [9] , and the current paper include: school autonomy in purchasing supplies has a positive relationship with student achievement and efficiency; and teachers' unions having a large influence on curriculum is associated with lower levels of student achievement and school efficiency. In fact, this paper finds that a large influence on curriculum by teachers' unions has a stronger negative association on school efficiency than any of the other institutional arrangements analyzed in this paper. Future research to determine the exact relationship between institutional arrangements and student achievement could provide more concrete answers for the contradictory evidence across the three studies mentioned above."}]
