The paper proposes scores based on z-score transformation and kernel density estimation (KDE) which are respectively Gaussian-based assumption and nonparametric modeling to detect the abnormality in MRI brain images. The methodologies are applied on gray-matter-based score of Voxel-base Morphometry (VBM) and sparse-based score of Sparse-based Morphometry (SBM). The experiments on well-designed normal control (CN) and Alzheimer disease (AD) subsets extracted from MRI data set of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) are conducted with threshold-based classification. The analysis of abnormality percentage of AD and CN population is carried out to validate the robustness of the proposed scores. The further cross validation on Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and Support vector machine (SVM) classification between AD and CN show significant accuracy rate, revealing the potential of statistical modeling to measure abnormality from a population of normal subjects."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The abnormality detection for brain imaging has been emerged as an attractive research field in which the aim is to identify the areas of impairment or abnormality in the brain structure. The automatic measurement of abnormality can be served as a reference for doctors to accurately diagnose various pathological diseases. In detection of impairment in brain structure, the difficulty increases from detecting tumors, multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer disease. In detection of impairment in brain structure, detecting multiple sclerosis (MS) is more difficult than detecting tumors. Moreover, the abnormality detection of Alzheimer disease is more difficult than both tumor and MS because the impairments in Alzheimer appear at small or tiny areas of the brain. Impairment in tumor shows in largest areas while multiple sclerosis appears at several average sized locations in the brain.\nOver the recent years, various automatic methods for abnormality detection have been proposed. While there are methods to learning the abnormality via normal and varied impairment subjects, there is still lack of methods to measure the general abnormality solely from the normal subjects. Among them, dictionary learning and sparse coding is currently common in tackling in multiple sclerosis (MS) (Deshpande et al., 2015 ) and brain tumors (Irimia et al., 2012) . In another work, the dictionary learn from healthy brain image tissue and sparse coding are used to automatically segment multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion via unsupervised method (Weiss et al., 2013) . Having the assumption that image patches of higher reconstruction errors contain lesions, a thresholding scheme on the errors is used for segmentation of MS lesions.\nAs one of the most popular method for automatic analysis of brain structure (Ashburner and Friston, 2000) , VBM has been successfully applied in the research of disorder (Radua and Mataix-Cols, 2009 ), aging (Huttona et al., 2009 ) and gender differences (Gooda et al., 2001) . While it lacks local brain anatomy representation, patch-based approach is efficient to capture local anatomical pattern and inter-subjects variability. The patch-based methods have achieved potential results in some applications of MRI image analysis.\nThe main goal of this work is to to measure normality pattern at voxel level from solely normal control subjects. Recently, there is a similar work proposing z-score transformation to compute abnormality via population of normal subjects in a case study of the children brain (Wilke et al., 2014) . This work is based on VBM methodology, where z-score is calculated from distribution of Gray Matter (GM), White Matter (WM) and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF). A lowrank and sparse components is used to exploit population information and to identify inconsistent parts of an image from the population which are more likely lesions (Liu et al., 2014) . However, these methods do not construct an abnormality score at voxel level.\nThis work constructs a methodology to investigate and to analyse the normality score generated from VBM and patch-based methodology. To validate the score, the classification is conducted on AD and CN subjects from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaing Initiative (ADNI) database. The contributions of this work are : (i) parametric and nonparametric statistical models at voxel level are presented to score abnormality from a training population of normal control subjects, (ii) the abnormality scoring is conducted from VBM and SBM methodologies, and (iii) the scores are validated by the classification of AD and CN subjects from ADNI database. The threshold-based is used to validate the discrimination between AD and CN scores while cross validation of LDA and SVM is conducted to validate the robustness of the scores with SVM and LDA classifiers."}, {"section_title": "SPARSE-BASED MORPHOMETRY", "text": "The Sparse-Based Morphometry (SBM) is the methodology based on the patch-based representation (Mairal et al., 2009) at each voxel level. The patchbased dictionary is constructed and patch-based reconstruction error is calculated from the dictionary. This paper calls the patch-based reconstruction errors the sparse code. The dictionary is constructed separately for each voxel from sparse code of normal anatomical patterns. At each voxel, after being extracted and centered by subtraction of its means, a 3D patch is normalised by dividing its norm and is vectorised into a vector x i . The dictionary of each voxel v is constructed as a collection of N patches where N is the size of dictionary set D. Function (1) determines the level of sparsity where \u03b3 is a positive parameter. The SPAMS toolbox (Mairal et al., 2009) 1 is used to solve optimization in Function (1). Each column of dictionary D is a vectorization of a patch encoding the possible local morphological configurations of the brain in the reference group D. The approximation D\u03b1 i is calculated to guarantee its best closeness to the patch x i via the term 1 2 x i \u2212 D\u03b1 i 2 2 . The purpose of the term \u03b1 i is to ensure that each extracted patch x i is able to be decomposed in a sparse way in the output 1 http://spams-devel.gforge.inria.fr/index.html dictionary D.\nAt a voxel v of an input subject Q, a patch p v Q is processed identically to the dictionary construction. Via the reconstruction mapping, the sparsebased score SM is the reconstruction cost to retrieve the closed relevant patch matched from the dictionary at the corresponding location.\nD v is the dictionary associated with the voxel at location v. The dictionary D is expected to have the capacity to sparsely reconstruct majority of the normal patches learned in D. Therefore, giving an abnormal brain subject such as AD, an approximation error\n2 would converge to a low sparity level, resulting statistical high values of \u03b1 1 and SM v Q . Accordingly, the value of function f is relatively high for abnormal brain anatomy voxel and relatively low for normal voxel."}, {"section_title": "NORMALITY SCORING", "text": "This paper employs a subpart of the standardised ADNI1 collection (Wyman et al., 2013) which is a commonly used dataset in Alzheimer disease research. Two groups of cognitively normal subjects (CN), named \"CN Dictionary\" and \"CN Training\", are constructed for dictionary and for mapping upon normal population. The CN dictionary is a collection of sparse representation of normal brain anatomy. The CN Training is a population representing for normal brain anatomy on which an unknown-pathology subject is projected for its normality measurement. In addition, two groups of CN and AD subjects are extracted for testing. To minimise bias of the experiments, these four groups are randomly selected with the same size of 70 subjects and similar correlation in age and gender distribution.\nFigure (1) shows the SBM and VBM methodologies to generate the abnormality map. The final goal of both methodologies is to measure the abnormality at voxel level, leading to an abnormality map. SBM methodology requires a Dictionary of patches constructed at each voxel to measure the sparse-based reconstruction cost SM. The SM values of an input subject are projected on the distribution of training CN subjects to measure the abnormality at the associated voxel location. This procedure is repeated with gray matter GM value in VBM methodology. The projection of a single value over a distribution is performed via z-score and KDE estimation."}, {"section_title": "Z-score", "text": "The abnormality score is calculated from the projection upon the training set T . In VBM methodology, for each voxel, assuming that the distribution of GM value of T as Gaussian distribution, z-score transformation is employed to scale it to the standard Gaussian distribution so that the abnormality score is measured upon the same standard normal distribution. For the input subject S, the zGM score is computed according to the Functions (3) and (5). GM score of the subjects Q at voxel v is denoted as GM v Q . The zGM v S|T is the GM score at voxel v of the subject Q projected on the normal population T . The score zGM of the subjects S is the average of zGM v . The \u00b5 v T and \u03c3 v T are mean and standard deviation of the distribution of GM values of subjects in T at the particular voxel v,\nSimilarly in SBM methodology, the zSM is calculated with the Functions (4) and (6). \u00b5 v T and \u03c3 v T are the mean and the standard deviation of the distribution {SM v |T }. zSM S|T denotes the score transformed by z-score over the distribution of the normal population T ."}, {"section_title": "Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)", "text": "The normality measurement can be addressed by the statistical principle of anomaly detection which is stated that \"an abnormality is an observation which is suspected of being partially or wholly irrelevant because it is not generated by the stochastic model assumed\" (Anscombe and Guttman, 1960) . To avoid biased assumption of the underlying distribution of the stochastic model, kernel density estimation (KDE) (Rosenblatt, 1956; Parzen, 1962) which is a nonparametric technique to estimate the density probability distribution and to measure the probability of x belonging to the distribution X. This probability P(x, X) for x to belong to the distribution X is calculated by the default KDE function in MATLAB.\nGiven an input GM v S , the probability of that voxel to be normal is the probability of that voxel belonging to the distribution computed according to the Functions (7) and (9). The normality score of the subject S is calculated as the average of the score kGM v . kGM S|T denotes the score transformed by KDE over the distribution of normal population T .\nSimilar to the score kGM, the sparse-based normality score by KDE is also computed by the Func-tions (8) and (10). kGM S|T denotes the score transformed by KDE over the distribution of normal population T ."}, {"section_title": "EXPERIMENTS", "text": "To validate the robustness of proposed scores in measuring the normality at voxel level, the evaluation of the distinction on Alzheimer patients is performed four scores and volume calculated within whole brain and hippocampus since impairment in hippocampus is the most contributing factor for AD disease (Braak and Braak, 1991) . Because of high complexity in sparse-based reconstruction from dictionary learning, the MRI image resolution is scaled down to half of the original dimension. In addition, in order to reduce time and resource to process voxels with low convergence of GM, only voxels with the GM higher than the threshold \u03b5 = 0.1 are processed. volume is calculated as the total number of voxels.\nThe Figure ( 2) provides a comparison between proposed scores calculated on testing AD and testing CN subjects. The scores kSM, kGM and zGM measure the normality while the score zSM measure the abnormality because high SM presents large reconstruction cost from the dictionary and high GM indicates the high convergence of gray matter. The figure reveals that normality score in hippo campus has wider range than that of the whole brain. Moreover, hippocampus has experienced a more significant difference between AD and CN scores than the whole brain. This statistically significant difference is shown by the t-test where p \u2264 10 \u22125 , except the case of kGM in the whole brain with p = 0.0012."}, {"section_title": "Threshold-based Classification", "text": "The Figure ( 3) presents the ROC curve of thresholdbased classification between AD and CN by volume and proposed scores. The Table ( 2) lists the area under the cure (AUC) and the cut-point for each classification. It is clearly from the Figure ( 3) that the classification on hippocampus are generally better than that on whole brain. In addition, the AUC and cutpoint for hippocampus are generally higher than that of whole brain. In term of AUC, the zSM achieves the best performance while kSM gains the best accuracy at cut-point. Seen from the AUC in hippocampus of the Table ( 2), the score zSM, kSM and zGM achieve the comparable AUC with more than 82% and better than volume. Meanwhile, kGM gains the worse performance among score, which is apparent because its significance p value from t-test are the highest among others.\nThe abnormality percentage in the area of observation (e.g. whole brain or hippocampus) is calculate to evaluate the abnormality at voxel level. The abnormality percentage is the ratio of number of abnormal voxel to the volume of the area of observation. A voxel is identified as abnormal if its score is above the threshold. In the observation of CN population, the score of every voxel of 70 CN subjects is collected and ranked. An array of thresholds is calculated based on training population so that abnormality percentage of ranging from 0% to 100% of abnormality of the test CN population T . Accordingly to the array of thresholds, the abnormality percentage are calculated for each subjects of the AD and CN population. Plotted in figure 4, abnormality percentage of AD and CN population are the averages of abnormality percentage over subjects within each populations.\nThe Figure 4 shows the correlation of abnormality percentage of AD and CN computed whole brain and hippocampus according to the array of thresholds. The y-axis presents the abnormality percentage of AD subjects while the x-axis presents the associated abnormality percentage of CN population from the identical thresholds. It is clear that the abnormality percentage computed in whole brain is significantly higher than that in hippocampus, which means there are larger areas of abnormality in hippocampus or abnormal regions in hippocampus. It is clearly from the Fig. 4 that the kSM and zSM show better abnormality percentage than kGM and zGM respectively. In a closer look, kSM and zSM show higher abnormality percentage than kGM and zGM, which means the kSM and zSM show the robustness of abnormality measurement in AD. The kSM and zSM show the clear distinction in terms of abnormality percentage among AD than kGM and zGM."}, {"section_title": "Cross-validation with LDA and SVM", "text": "Additional validation the robustness of scores measuring the normality at voxel level are conducted on classification between AD and CN with two classifiers Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) (Fisher, 1936) and Support vector machine (SVM) (Cortes and Vapnik, 95 ) via leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) (Devijver and Kittler, 1982) . The LOOCV is employed to minimise bias. The Table 2 and CN subjects based on the volume, four abnormality scores transformed from SBM and V BM methodology. The classification is performed on whole brain and hippocampus areas. The hippocampus observed in this work comprises four regions of interest (ROI): hippocampus left, hippocampus right, para hippocampus left, para hippocampus right, which is defined in the Automatic Anatomical Labeling (AAL) (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002) . The classification rates are measured in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity which are abbreviated as \"Acc\", \"Sen\" and \"Spec\" in the tables. Features for classifiers LDA and SVM are \"Vol\" standing for Volume, zGM, kGM, zSM and kSM. For convenient presentation, the expression of \"classifier\"-\"feature\" is used to mention that classifier with the specific feature. For example, LDA-zGM represents classifier LDA with zGM. Seen from the table, while impairment in hippocampus region is the most contributed factors for AD disease (Braak and Braak, 1991) , the volume of hippocampus gained less improved than the volume of the whole brain. This fact proved that the feature on volume does not reveal accurately the abnormality degree of the brain. On the other hand, volume feature lacks of capability to rank or measure the abnormality in voxel level instead the score show the score for brain or region levels. In regard to accuracy rate in whole brain, LDA-Vol, SVM-Vol and LDA-kSM achieved the best performance at 72.86%. Most of classifications with four scores do not improve upon this classification rate but classification procedures on hippocampus areas. Among them the highest accuracy of classification is SVM and LDA with kSM score on hippocampus regions, accounting for 82.14% and 80.71% respectively. In most of the case except the case of SVM on zGM score, the score calculated in hippocampus areas achieved better performance in term of classification rate than that calculated in the whole brain. The improvement of classification rate in hippocampus areas reveals the robustness of model in measuring the abnormality score. It is evident from the table, the z-score transformations of GM and SM do not significantly improve the classification rate compared with volume feature both on whole brain and hippocampus except LDA-zGM with 76.43% and SVM-zGM with 75.71%. In further analysis, to compute the robustness of the score in terms of the classification rate between the whole brain and hippo campus areas, the gap between whole brain and hippocampus is calculated.\nThe table 3 presents the subtraction classification rate of whole brain from hippocampus. This subtraction is computed on accuracy, sensitivity and specificity rate. The feature volume and SVM show the degraded performance in terms of accuracy rate, revealing that volume feature is not a proper feature measuring abnormality. While the SVM-kSM achieved the best improvement in hippocampus areas(i.e. 12.14%), the one on zSM degraded performance at a negative gap of -2.86%, proving a conclusion that KDE transformation is better than z-score transformation in computing abnormality score. In addition, KDE is considerably better than z-score transformation in two cases of LDA on SM and SVM on GM (i.e. 7.86% vs 1.43 % and 10.71% vs 4.29%) while there is a mere degradation of KDE with z-score on LDA on GM (i.e. LDA-kGM of 5.00% vs LDAzGM of 5.71%).\nVia KDE transformation, SM score show improvements over GM score for particular cases such as with SVM classifier (i.e. SVM-kSM of 12.14% vs SVM-kGM of 10.71%), LDA classifier (i.e. LDAkSM of 7.86% vs LDA-kGM of 5.00%)\nAssuming in the experiments that positive and negative are denoted as CN subject and AD subjects, it is preferable for classification methodologies with high Specificity because of preventive cure for the disease. It is clearly from the Table 2 , SVM-kSM performed the best in terms of specificity, accounting for 77.14% while SVM-zGM gained the highest sensitivity rate at 94.29%. Moreover, in the Table 3 , the SVM and LDA on kSM have significant gap of specificity rate with 18.57% and 12.86% respectively. On the other hand, volume feature degraded the specificity with negative gaps of -17.14% and -5.71%. There is a drop in specificity of 22.86% and 11.43% for SVM and LDA on zSM respectively. In the case of GM score, the gaps of specificity are considerably small except LDA-zGM at 4.29 %."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "This paper has introduced methodologies for abnormality scoring from solely projecting on normal population via VBM and SBM methodologies. Inspired by the statistical anomaly detection techniques, zscore transformation, i.e. standardised Gaussianbased assumption, and KDE, i.e. nonparametric statistical model, are used. Since the scores are measured by only CN subjects, the methods can be efficiently implemented without prior knowledge of abnormality. The method is applied on GM from VBM methodology and sparse code from SBM methodology. The sparse code is deduced from dictionary learning and sparse representation of a separate normal population. Subsets of CN and AD population are extracted from ADNI database with similar cohesion of age and gender. Finally, the proposed score is evaluated via threshold-based classification and the robustness is demonstrated by achieving the best AUC and cut-point rates of 86.29% and 80%, respectively. Additionally, AD population has higher abnormality percentage than CN, demonstrating the novelty of proposed scores in measurement of normality. The results are significantly potential for further applications to the detection of other pathologies since the normality scores calculated solely from CN patient are able to detect Alzheimer disease with simple threshold classification. Additionally, the proposed score is evaluated via SVM and LDA classifiers within LOOCV procedure and the robustness is demonstrated by gaining the accuracy and sensitivity rates of more than 80% and 90%, respectively."}]
