[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Brown shrimp Farfantepenaeus aztecus support a commercially important fishery in the northern Gulf of Mexico, and the juvenile shrimp use coastal estuaries as nurseries. Production of young shrimp from these nurseries, and hence commercial harvest of adults from the Gulf, is highly variable from year to year. Our recently published, individualbased model attempted to explain this variability as a function of habitat and the environmental factors such as temperature, salinity, and access to intertidal marsh habitat. We conducted a mark-recapture field study between April 12 and June 9, 2011, to provide growth rate data for model testing, as well as to further examine factors that affect growth, including available food biomass. Brown shrimp growth rates were measured in three polyhaline marsh ponds over periods of 2 to 4 weeks. We recorded hourly temperature and flooding data and measured biomass of infaunal food organisms. We parameterized our production model with input from 2011 to compare modeled output with observed data. Mean growth rate estimates from the model were similar to the estimated mean growth rate observed in the field (1.13 mm/d and 1.06 mm/d, respectively); however, field growth rates differed significantly among three marsh ponds (1.02, 1.03, and 1.26 mm/d). Data on infaunal biomass suggest that spatial and temporal variability in available food organisms is related to differences in shrimp growth, and the inclusion of such information may enhance the model. The U.S. Gulf of Mexico (GoM) landings of penaeid shrimp are valued at over US$300 million annually, and brown shrimp Farfantepenaeus aztecus comprise about half of the catch (NMFS Fishery Statistics Division 2015).\nBrown shrimp have a largely annual life history (Minello et al. 1989; Fry 2008) ; adults spawn offshore and postlarvae are transported by currents to estuarine habitats (Temple and Fischer 1967; Cook and Lindner 1970)."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "The U.S. Gulf of Mexico (GoM) landings of penaeid shrimp are valued at over US$300 million annually, and brown shrimp Farfantepenaeus aztecus comprise about half of the catch (NMFS Fishery Statistics Division 2015) .\nBrown shrimp have a largely annual life history (Minello et al. 1989; Fry 2008) ; adults spawn offshore and postlarvae are transported by currents to estuarine habitats (Temple and Fischer 1967; Cook and Lindner 1970) .\nJuveniles grow rapidly for several months in estuaries before they emigrate offshore as subadults (Christmas and Etzold 1977; Renfro and Brusher 1982) . The inshore, estuarine-dependent phase is a period of high and variable growth rates and likely determines the overall production of young shrimp and resultant fishery yield (Minello et al. 1989; Minello and Zimmerman 1991; Haas et al. 2001) .\nIn Leo et al. (2016) we described an individual-based model (IBM) that uses temperature, salinity, and access to estuarine salt marsh habitat to estimate brown shrimp production (in 70-mm individuals per hectare) from the shallow waters of Galveston Bay, Texas. The growth rate of shrimp at an hourly time step is an important aspect of the model and has a large influence on production estimates. Additionally, since mortality rates are size dependent (Minello et al. 1989) , shrimp that grow faster are more likely to survive. The model has reproduced biomass and size distribution patterns observed in data from Galveston Bay from 1983 to 2012, and the annual production estimates correlate with fishery-independent estimates of abundance from offshore northern GoM trawls. There was no correlation, however, between model production estimates and trawl data collected in Galveston Bay. These comparisons between the model output and field studies suggest that, although temperature, salinity, and flooding patterns may influence production generally from estuaries along the northern GoM, there are other factors affecting production that are spatially and temporally variable within individual bays.\nJuvenile shrimp are known to feed on benthic infauna, mainly crustaceans and annelids, from marsh sediments Zimmerman 1991, 1998) , and the abundance and biomass of infauna are highest within the marsh vegetation (Whaley and Minello 2002) . Although growth of brown shrimp increases in our IBM when they are within marsh vegetation, there is no explicit relationship between infaunal biomass and shrimp growth (Leo et al. 2016) . Since infaunal abundance, composition, and biomass can be both spatially and temporally variable (Mannino and Montagna 1997; Whaley and Minello 2002) , we identified infaunal distribution as a potential source of variation between modeled growth and observed growth in the field.\nWe conducted a mark-recapture field study of juvenile brown shrimp from April to June of 2011 to estimate growth rates and variability of the shrimp among small marsh ponds in Galveston Bay and to compare these with the growth rate estimates predicted by an IBM for brown shrimp production by Leo et al. (2016) . Additionally, we examined benthic infaunal abundance as a potential factor in variability of growth rates. We also assessed how well the modeled estimates of water temperature and tidal flooding of the marsh vegetation represented observed data from the ponds."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "Site selection and characterization.-We selected three marsh ponds for our growth study that were generally representative of the marsh habitat in Galveston Bay. These ponds were fringed with saltmarsh cordgrass Spartina alterniflora and were connected to the bay by relatively narrow channels, which could be blocked by nets. Two sites were located within Texas Parks and Wildlife Department's Galveston Island State Park (GISP) along the bay side of Galveston Island (Figure 1) . The park is located along the shore of West Bay, a polyhaline (salinity of 18& to 30&) water body of the Galveston Bay estuary (Rozas and Minello 2009 ), and we designated the study ponds as GISP-Small and GISP-Large based on their relative sizes. The third pond was located 20 km away in Galveston Bay on the edge of the Nature Conservancy Prairie Preserve on Moses Lake (Moses Lake pond). This pond is north of the Texas City Dike and closer than either of the GISP ponds to freshwater input from the Trinity and San Jacinto rivers and was selected in an effort to include a mesohaline (salinity of 5& to 18&) pond. Salinities during the duration of the study, however, were consistently polyhaline in all three ponds.\nEach pond has a nonvegetated mud bottom. We used GIS and digital orthophoto quarter quadrangle (DOQQ) images made from color infrared aerial photographs to estimate the linear distance of marsh edge and the nonvegetated area in each pond. We estimated the marsh elevation profile in each pond by establishing five transects perpendicular to the vegetated marsh edge (Minello et al. 2012) . Along each transect, we estimated elevation by measuring water depth at the marsh edge and at 1, 2, and 3 m into the nonvegetated water and 1 and 2 m into the vegetation (Figure 2) . We used these relative elevation data in conjunction with hourly monitoring of tide height to estimate frequency and duration of marsh flooding in each pond. Data loggers (HOBO, Onset Corporation, Bourne, Massachusetts) were used to record hourly water depth and temperature and were placed near the center of the ponds at an elevation approximately 1 m lower than the edge to ensure submersion throughout the study period. We assumed that the marsh was flooded when the water depth at the marsh edge reached 10 cm, the point in our IBM at which shrimp can access the marsh vegetation.\nBrown shrimp growth estimates.-We conducted markrecapture studies in each experimental pond. We collected brown shrimp in each pond using a bag seine and sorted them into 2-mm-TL size-classes between 30 and 50 mm. We selected two to four size-classes for tagging based on the size-classes that were most abundant. We attempted to tag at least 300 shrimp during each sampling effort; however, the number of shrimp tagged varied over the study period due to shrimp availability (Table 1) . We tagged shrimp 348 ventrally in the muscle of the sixth abdominal segment using Visible Implant Elastomer (VIE; Northwest Marine Technology, Shaw Island, Washington). Tagging has shown no effect on growth in lab studies (Baker and Minello 2010) . Each size-class had a unique tag color. Tag colors were not duplicated in the same pond during the length of the study.\nTagging and recovery efforts occurred in all three ponds between April and June 2011 (Table 1 ). There were five visits to GISP-Small ponds and three each at GISPLarge ponds and Moses Lake. During this time, we tagged and released 2,251 shrimp. Total length (mm) of recovered tagged shrimp was measured, and their tag color was recorded. Growth rate was calculated for recovered, tagged shrimp color groups by subtracting the initial mean TL from the mean final TL and dividing by the number of days at large.\nMortality is closely linked to brown shrimp size and therefore growth, because mortality rates are size dependent. Our original methodology included data collection for mortality estimates. Complications in the field violated assumptions of our mortality estimate methodology, rendering them invalid. In the Discussion, we describe how the lack of mortality estimates from the field project could cause errors when comparing modeled output with field observations. Brown shrimp production model overview.-The Leo et al. (2016) model is a spatially explicit IBM that simulates the cumulative effects of temperature, salinity, and access to emergent marsh vegetation on the growth and Mortality also has a base value that is modified by size (mm TL) and habitat. Depending on the tide height, shrimp may move between vegetated and nonvegetated habitats at each time step. Shrimp that move into vegetated habitat benefit from a slight increase in growth rate and a decrease in mortality risk.\nTo compare model output with our field growth study, in which all three ponds remained polyhaline, all cells in the model were parameterized with zone 3 salinity (\u226520&). In all salinity zones, modeled growth rates increase with temperature, peak around 30\u00b0C, and then slow substantially. Expected hourly water temperature values (EXP T ) in nonvegetated habitat are determined in the model by using the median daily air temperature (https:// www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools) and relationships developed with daily median water temperature and a diel pattern of deviation from that median. From this, the model calculates water temperature in vegetated habitat based on an empirical relationship developed from unpublished data comparing water temperatures in vegetated and nonvegetated habitat.\nFlooding of the marsh surface gives shrimp access to additional infaunal prey for increased growth (Whaley and Minello 2002; Roth et al. 2008 ) and is a function of both tidal dynamics and marsh topography (Rozas 1995; Minello et al. 2012) . The model determines expected marsh flooding (EXP F ) by comparing the elevation of marsh edge in Galveston Bay with hourly water level data from the NOAA tide gauge located at Pier 21 in the Galveston ship channel (station number 8771450; https:// tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/waterlevels.html?id=8771450). When the tide gauge reads 10 cm higher than the marsh edge elevation, the vegetated marsh habitat cells become accessible to the modeled shrimp. The tide-elevation relationship is adjusted annually in the model for the effects of relative sea level rise. Appendix 1 in Leo et al. (2016) provides a complete model description in overview, design concepts, and details (ODD) protocol as outlined by Railsback and Grimm (2012) .\nModel evaluation.-We ran 10 simulations of the Leo et al. (2016) model using temperature and tide data available for 2011. Previous modelling showed that 10 replicates were sufficient to capture variability between model runs. These inputs generated hourly EXP T and EXP F values in the model, which we compared with actual temperature (ACT T ) and flooding (ACT F ) values recorded in each pond. Then we calculated the mean modeled daily growth rate (AESE) during the period specific to each pond ( Table 2) . We compared the modeled growth rate with the actual growth rate estimate from each pond. Then we parameterized the model with the pond-specific ACT T and ACT F values to see whether differences between modeled growth rates and actual growth rates could be caused by differences between actual and modeled tide and temperature values. To identify which parameters might drive differences between modeled and actual growth rates, we reparameterized the model twice more with (1) modelestimated temperatures and pond-specific actual flooding (EST T , ACT F ) and (2) pond-specific actual temperatures and model-estimated flooding (ACT T , EST F ). We ran 10 simulations under each scenario and determined the pondspecific modeled growth rates.\nInfauna.-We examined the availability of infaunal food organisms by sampling benthic infauna at the beginning and end of the growth study to estimate abundance before and after peak marsh residence of brown shrimp. Benthic collections were performed in 2011 between April 12 and June 7 at GISP-Small, April 21 and June 1 at GISP-Large, and April 20 and June 2 at Moses Lake. We collected benthic cores in each pond and measured infaunal abundance and biomass in relation to the distance from the marsh edge. Ten replicate cores were collected at each of three distances from the marsh edge: 1 m into the vegetation, 1 m into the nonvegetated pond, and 5 m into the nonvegetated pond. We selected these collection sites randomly along the length of the marsh edge interface. At each site, we randomly collected three 5-cm-diameter sediment cores from within a 1-m 2 quadrat and then pooled the three cores for further analysis. This approach resulted in 180 core samples (10 replicates 9 3 distances from edge 9 3 ponds 9 2 collection periods), each representing an area of 58.9 cm 2 . In the lab, we counted, dried (at 100\u00b0C for 24 h), and weighed crustaceans and annelids as the main food sources for brown shrimp (Whaley and Minello 2002) . We estimated prey biomass per square meter as the mean sum of the dry weight of annelids and crustaceans (g/m 2 ) at three distances from the marsh edge. Data analysis.-We calculated mean growth rates for recovered shrimp in each of the three ponds. After testing for homogeneity of variance (F-max test), we used an ANOVA and Tukey's honest significant difference (HSD) test to compare growth rates among ponds. We used regression analysis to examine effects of size, temperature, and flooding duration on shrimp growth and to examine the relationships between measured growth and modeled growth. We also calculated regressions between ACT T and the EXP T . We evaluated the flooding submodel by comparing hourly the ACT F (where \"flooded\" = 10 cm or greater water over the edge elevation) to the EXP F . We used an ANOVA and Tukey's HSD test to compare growth rates between tide and temperature scenarios within each pond. Finally, we used a two-way ANOVA to compare infaunal biomass among ponds and distances (1 m, \u00c01 m, \u00c05 m) from the marsh edge. We conducted this analysis separately for the infaunal data collected before and after the growth study."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Pond Characteristics", "text": "Based on our analyses of infrared aerial photographs, we estimated that the GISP-Small pond's nonvegetated area was 668 m 2 and had 244 m of marsh edge-open water interface. The edge was highly reticulated and enclosed small islands of saltmarsh cordgrass within the pond. GISP-Large pond had 3,299 m 2 of nonvegetated area and 268 m of marsh edge interface. The Moses Lake pond area was 471 m 2 and had 132 m of marsh edge (Figure 1) . A comparison of elevation profiles between ponds showed that the Moses Lake profile was slightly steeper than those in GISP, and that both ponds within GISP had similar profiles (Figure 2) .\nDuring the GISP-Small study period, the marsh edge was observed flooded (greater than 10 cm of water depth over the edge elevation) 75.4% of the time (Figure 3) , and hourly observed water temperatures ranged from 14.6\u00b0C to 33.3\u00b0C (Figure 4 ) with a mean of 26.3\u00b0C.

The model's estimate of mean daily growth rate of shrimp during the field study was within 0.07-0.09 mm/d of the mean daily growth rate observed in the field demonstrating that the model is useful in predicting growth of brown shrimp at least within the tide and temperature parameters observed within the field study period. The mark-recapture approach to measuring shrimp growth in the field has the potential to overestimate growth through the selection of faster-growing animals for recapture since survival rates are size dependent, and slower-growing shrimp may experience higher mortality than relatively faster-growing shrimp. Growth rate values observed from our recaptured brown shrimp, however, were normally distributed and in a wide range (0.29-1.86 mm/d). Additionally, our mean estimates of growth rate are comparable (0.52-1.90 mm/d) to the results of brown shrimp growth experiments using a variety of methodologies: field caging, laboratory growth experiments, von Bertalanffy growth curve construction, and other methods of mark-recapture, which are not subject to the same artifacts (Zein-Eldin 1963; Ch avez 1973; Knudsen et al. 1977; Rozas and Minello 2011) . We were unable to account for mortality rates in our field study. If we make the assumption that the shrimp tagged in each size-class have growth rates normally distributed around some mean, and if mortality rates are higher for slowergrowing individuals in the tagged group, then it is possible that the majority of recaptured shrimp are on the fastergrowing end of that normal distribution, which would thus skew the growth rate estimates. However, if fasterand slower-growing shrimp are normally distributed among the marsh pond locations, we should still be able to detect relative differences in growth rates among the ponds in the study.\nIn the model, growth is driven by temperature and marsh flooding. The temperature submodel based on median air temperature performed well when we compared estimated temperature values EXP T with actual data ACT T from the individual ponds (R 2 = 0.827, 0.826, and 0.772 for GISP-Small, GISP-Large, and Moses Lake, respectively). In general, ACT T temperature maxima were cooler than EXP T temperature maxima. The EXP F submodel determines when the marsh vegetation is flooded based on elevation data. Edge elevation profiles from all three ponds are well within the estimated mean edge elevations of Spartina marshes in Galveston Bay (Minello et al. 2012 (Minello et al. , 2015 . The model predicted that marsh habitat would be flooded 77.1% of the time. This is within 2% of the ACT F frequency of both the GISP-Small and GISPLarge ponds' actual flooding. The slightly steeper slope located at Moses Lake resulted in flooding almost 15% less frequently.\nThe EXP T submodel predicted similar temperatures for all three ponds. The EXP F was also similar for the three ponds. Since salinity did not change in the model, temperature and flooding were the only drivers of growth. These conditions resulted in similar growth rates among the three ponds. The ACT T was also similar among ponds, but ACT F was significantly lower at Moses Lake than at the GISP ponds. When ACT T and ACT F were used as model inputs, growth rates of shrimp in GISP-Small and GISP-Large ponds were slightly higher than in Moses Lake. These results were not consistent with our field study observations, suggesting that growth rate is not strictly predicted by temperature and flooding patterns.\nAlthough brown shrimp in Moses Lake were exposed to lower temperatures than predicted by the model, as well as fewer opportunities to enter the marsh, they grew at a significantly higher rate than those in the model 354 simulations. Additionally, there was very little hourly difference between temperatures observed in GISP ponds and those in Moses Lake. Not only did the GISP ponds have a similar temperature pattern (on average, 0.33\u00b0C warmer), but the lower mean edge elevation resulted in longer and more frequent marsh vegetation flooding. Given those parameters only, one would expect estimates of shrimp growth rate at Moses Lake to be lower than that in either of the GISP ponds. Still, the mean growth rate estimate at Moses Lake was significantly higher.\nBenthic infauna are an important food source for juvenile brown shrimp (McTigue and Zimmerman 1991). We observed significantly higher growth rates of shrimp in Moses Lake, the location with the highest infaunal abundance. We observed temporal patterns of higher infaunal abundance in spring and lower abundance in late summer. We also saw spatial patterns of abundance in which infauna were concentrated in vegetated edge habitat and less so in the shallow pond. These observations are consistent with Whaley and Minello (2002) , in which they described a spatial pattern of benthic infaunal abundance at different distances from the marsh edge. Benthic infaunal abundance and biomass are highest in the first meter of vegetation, where shrimp access is limited by the tide. They also described a temporal pattern in which infaunal abundance is higher in spring and declines toward the end of summer, presumably the result of predation during the high tides of spring and early summer.\nBased on these observations, the inclusion of benthic infauna data in our model may help resolve some of the differences between modeled and observed growth rates. However, the development and addition of these data may add an unnecessary layer of complexity to the model. The mean modeled growth rate under the conditions of 2011 was 1.13 to 1.15 mm/d (Table 3) "}]
