[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Pathogenic variation in MAPT, GRN, and C9ORF72 accounts for at most only half of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) cases with a family history of neurological disease. This suggests additional variants and genes that remain to be identified as risk factors for FTLD. We conducted a case-control genetic association study comparing pathologically diagnosed FTLD patients (n = 94) to cognitively normal older adults (n = 3541), and found suggestive evidence that gene-wide aggregate rare variant burden in MFSD8 is associated with FTLD risk. Because homozygous mutations in MFSD8 cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), similar to homozygous mutations in GRN, we assessed rare variants in MFSD8 for relevance to FTLD through experimental follow-up studies. Using post-mortem tissue from middle frontal gyrus of patients with FTLD and controls, we identified increased MFSD8 protein levels in MFSD8 rare variant carriers relative to non-variant carrier patients with sporadic FTLD and healthy controls. We also observed an increase in lysosomal and autophagy-related proteins in MFSD8 rare variant carrier and sporadic FTLD patients relative to controls. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that MFSD8 was expressed in neurons and astrocytes across subjects, without clear evidence of abnormal localization in patients. Finally, in vitro studies identified marked disruption of lysosomal function in cells from MFSD8 rare variant carriers, and identified one rare variant that significantly increased the cell surface levels of MFSD8. Considering the growing evidence for altered autophagy in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, our findings support a role of NCL genes in FTLD risk and suggest that MFSD8-associated lysosomal dysfunction may contribute to FTLD pathology."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) accounts for 5-10% of all dementia cases and is a leading cause of presenile dementias [45, 50] . Pathologically diagnosed FTLD is defined by neurodegeneration in the frontal and temporal lobes, leading to heterogeneous clinical symptomatology classified as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) [77, 49] . This pattern of degeneration slowly alters complex traits that make us most human, including behavior and language. Changes in personality and behavior are a hallmark of behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) patients [57] , while the nonfluent variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA) and semantic variant PPA (svPPA) syndromes are characterized by impaired speech and language expression and comprehension [16] .\nApproximately, 40% of all FTLD patients have a family member with a neurological or psychiatric disorder, and an estimated 10-20% of cases are caused by a single inherited pathogenic variant [58, 61] . The majority of genetic FTLD cases are due to pathogenic variation in one of three genes, MAPT, GRN, and C9ORF72, each resulting in different patterns of protein aggregation (broadly speaking, tau in MAPT and TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP)-43 in GRN and C9ORF72) with distinctive neuroanatomical patterns across the cortical and subcortical brain regions. Rare and pathogenic variants in other genes have been established to cause less than 5% of familial FTLD cases (i.e., VCP, CHMP2B, TARDBP, FUS, OPTN, and TBK1 [49, 54, 61, 64] ). Nevertheless, nearly half of all patients with a family history suggestive of a genetic etiology do not carry a pathogenic variant in a known FTLD-associated gene, making it likely that additional genetic risk factors exist [49] .\nThe application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in association studies has facilitated the identification of novel genetic risk factors or causes for many complex diseases. In particular, whole genome and whole exome sequencing (WGS and WES, respectively) have increased our understanding of how rare variation, which often has larger biological effects than common variation, contributes to disease [13] . The development of burden-based statistical tests has also accelerated the characterization of how gene-wide rare variation contributes to disease risk, especially for diseases with relatively small patient populations [33] . Importantly, these analyses can assess whether different rare variants occurring in the same gene are enriched in affected versus unaffected individuals. These advances have increased appreciation for the contribution of rare variants to the heritable portion of complex disease phenotypes unexplained by common variants. In the context of FTLD, genetic discoveries have informed potential pathogenic mechanisms for disease, and highlight how dysfunction in the endo-lysosomal system may lead to a loss of neuronal proteostasis, ultimately contributing to disease development [17] .\nIn this study, we analyzed NGS data from pathologically diagnosed, sporadic FTLD patients to identify new genetic risk factors for FTLD. We found that aggregate rare variant burden in MFSD8 was enriched in FTLD patients relative to clinically normal older controls. We further assessed MFSD8 for its relevance to FTLD through biochemical analysis of post-mortem tissue from FTLD patients carrying the same rare variants in MFSD8 associated with disease risk. This revealed disturbances in protein levels of MFSD8, as well as lysosomal and autophagy-related markers compared to clinically normal older controls. We also localized MFSD8 protein to neurons and astrocytes. Finally, we demonstrated marked disruption of lysosomal function in cells derived from MFSD8 rare variant carriers, and at least one rare variant associated with FTLD risk was found to increase the cell surface levels of MFSD8 in transfected cell lines. These findings implicate rare variation in MFSD8 as a novel candidate risk factor for FTLD, and support a role for autophagy and lysosomal dysfunction in FTLD pathobiology."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants and clinical assessment", "text": "Patients from across the FTLD spectrum (n = 94) were assessed and clinically diagnosed at the University of California, San Francisco Memory and Aging Center (UCSF MAC).

All participants underwent clinical assessment during an in-person visit to the UCSF MAC that included a neurological exam, cognitive assessment, and medical history [46, 56] . Each participant's study partner (i.e., spouse or close friend) was also interviewed regarding functional abilities. A multidisciplinary team composed of a neurologist, neuropsychologist, and nurse then established clinical diagnoses for cases according to consensus criteria for FTD and its subtypes [14, 16] . All cases underwent an autopsy through the UCSF Neurodegenerative Disease Brain Bank and were diagnosed with an FTLD spectrum disorder. Patients with FTLD-tau (Pick's disease, corticobasal degeneration (CBD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), or unclassifiable), argyrophilic grain disease, FTLD-TDP (types A, B, C, or unclassifiable), FTLD-UPS (ubiquitin positive), or FTLD-FUS (atypical FTLD-U) pathology were included across all stages of analysis (see Table S1 for more details).\nClinically normal older controls were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP; n = 3541). All ADSP controls were originally recruited through the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium and the Cohorts for Heart Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology consortia.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and INDEL variants were called using GATK HaplotypeCaller. To improve variant call accuracy, multiple single-sample genomic variant call files (GVCFs) were jointly genotyped using GATK GenotypeGVCFs, which generates a multisample variant call file (VCF).\nThe tools and parameters used to process ADSP WES data at the three NHGRI sequencing centers are detailed on the National Institute on Aging Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease Data Storage Site (https ://www.niaga ds.org/ adsp/conte nt/seque ncing -pipel ines).

The overall VCF was used in the discovery analysis (n = 2661), while the BAM files for MFSD8 were used for joint variant calling across all cases and controls included in the refined analyses (n = 3635). Sequencing data from the NHGRI sites was aligned to different versions of the GRCh37 human reference genome, and we verified that there was 100% concordance between the sequences for MFSD8 across these versions of the reference genomes. To further ensure data quality, we used GATK's DepthOfCoverage tool to determine that the average sequencing depth across all target regions in BAM files from all sequencing centers was > 30 \u00d7, which is sufficient for reliable variant calling [35, 76] . Based on these assessments, we determined the WES control data to be of sufficient quality and reliability to combine with our WGS data and performed joint variant calling across BAM files containing reads aligned to the coding exons of MFSD8 \u00b1 1 bp surrounding each exon from all data sources using the same methods described above.

The resulting filtered VCF was annotated with gene names, variant type (i.e., exonic, intronic, etc.), and amino acid change for all exonic variants using Annovar [71] . Once annotated with gene names, we also excluded variants in false positive genes that exhibit a high frequency of rare protein-altering variants in whole exome and genome sequencing studies since these genes likely do not contribute to FTLD risk [15, 63] . For the discovery analysis, separate, filtered VCFs of joint calls from FTLD cases (n = 62) or ADSP controls (n = 2599) were converted to PLINK format and merged using PLINK [55] . The merged dataset was filtered to remove variants with genotyping rates below 95%, and minor allele frequencies (MAF) greater than 0.5%. For the refined analysis, a separate VCF was generated from joint variant calling across target regions of MFSD8 for all FTLD cases and controls. This VCF was filtered as mentioned above, converted to PLINK format, and filtered again to remove variants with genotyping rates below 99% and MAFs greater than 0.5%, followed by removal of individuals with genotyping rates below 90% in targeted regions of MFSD8. Gene variant sets for the discovery analysis were created from SNPs alone, while the gene variant set for the refined analysis included SNPs and small INDELs (< 5 bp to increase reliability of calls).

We found a significant decrease in total rates of protein degradation in rare variant carrier cell lines compared to controls (Fig. 3a,  b) . This decrease in intracellular proteolysis primarily results from impaired lysosomal degradation. The rate of lysosomal degradation in MFSD8 variant carrier cells also remained significantly reduced upon serum removal, a condition known to stimulate autophagy (Fig. 3a, b) . Immunofluorescence staining in the same cells revealed an increase in the number of autophagosomes (LC3 positive puncta) in MFSD8 rare variant carrier cells relative to controls (Fig. 3c, d ). Interestingly, although there was a trend toward increased number of lysosomes (LAMP-2 positive puncta) in cells from MFSD8 rare variant carriers, the most distinct difference relative to control cells was the lower average size of lysosomes (Fig. 3d) . Co-immunostaining revealed that a fraction of cellular MFSD8 was detected in LAMP-2 positive vesicles, consistent with its previously described lysosomal location, and that cells from MFSD8 rare variant (right). Quantification was done for n = 4 fields. Differences with control are significant at P < 0.05*, P < 0.01**, or P < 0.001***. e Co-immunostaining for MFSD8 and LAMP-2 in the same cells. Left: representative images of merge fields. Nuclei were stained with Dapi. Insets show squared regions in the nucleus (1) and cytosol (2) at higher magnification. Right: quantification of MFSD8 in the nucleus (left), cytosol (middle) or associated to LAMP-2 positive compartments (right). Values are mean + SEM of n = 4 fields. Differences with control are significant at P < 0.05* or P < 0.01** carriers displayed significantly higher co-localization of both proteins (Fig. 3e) . Furthermore, the observed immunoreactivity of MFSD8 in the nucleus of cells from controls and MFSD8 rare variant carriers was consistent with our IHC findings in post-mortem tissue (Fig. 3e) . Taken together, the higher number of autophagosomes without lysosomal expansion in MFSD8 rare variant carrier cell lines suggest that the autophagic failure originates from poor lysosomal clearance of autophagosomes. This phenotype is similar to the one observed in Mfsd8 knock-out mice [9] , supporting the hypothesis that rare missense variants in MFSD8 associated with FTLD risk result in reduced MFSD8 protein function.\nIntriguingly, we found more pronounced changes in the two lysosomal marker proteins, LAMP-2 and CTSD, than LAMP-1 (a broader endo-lysosomal maker) in post-mortem brain tissue from MFSD8 rare variant carriers (Fig. S3) . In addition, we observed that not all MFSD8 co-localized with LAMP-2 (Fig. 3e) , and we therefore used subcellular fractionation of mouse brain homogenates to further characterize Mfsd8 in different lysosomal subgroups [12] . Mouse Mfsd8 was detected at very low levels in autolysosomes that originate from fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes [26] (Fig. S4) . However, Mfsd8 was very abundant in a population of lysosomes that display high activity for chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), a selective form of autophagy where substrate proteins are directly translocated across the lysosomal membrane for degradation [12, 24] (Fig. S4) . Increased abundance of Mfsd8 in this group of lysosomes is intriguing since defective CMA has previously been described in several neurodegenerative diseases, including FTLD [51, 72] . S217G, E336Q, F379S,  G385R, I492T) were generated, dual-tagged with GFP and HA (GFP-HA-MFSD8), transiently expressed in HEK-293T cells and compared to cells expressing human reference sequence (WT) MFSD8 and negative control, GFP-transfected cells. One day after transfection, the cells were lysed and the lysates analyzed by immunoblotting for MFSD8 using an HA antibody. The tagged MFSD8 constructs ran as a collection of specific bands ranging in size from approximately 55-85 kD. All variants displayed grossly normal overall expression, but one variant, F379S, frequently showed subtle increases in several distinct lower molecular weight (MW) bands, relative to WT MFSD8. Immunoblots from two representative experiments are shown in a, b, and the accumulated lower-MW bands for variant F379S are indicated by (*).

Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that none of the variants altered total MFSD8 protein abundance (Fig. 4) , but changes were observed in the cell surface expression of MFSD8. Specifically, the F379S variant showed a modest but significant increase in cell surface expression as well as accumulation of a lower molecular weight band on the cell surface relative to reference sequence MFSD8 (Fig. 4,  *) . The G385R variant demonstrated a smaller increase in surface expression that did not reach significance. These findings suggest that the F379S variant may affect MFSD8 function by altering its intracellular trafficking."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In the present study, we analyzed sequencing data from pathologically diagnosed sporadic FTLD patients and clinically normal older controls to identify genetic risk factors for FTLD. Gene-level association tests implicated aggregate rare variant burden in the NCL-linked gene, MFSD8, in FTLD risk. Follow-up experimental studies were used to investigate the possible role of MFSD8 in FTLD pathobiology and lysosomal function. Our studies revealed a modest increase in MFSD8 protein in MFG of FTLD patients harboring rare variants in MFSD8 relative to patients with sporadic FTLD and controls. This effect was most marked in rare variant carriers diagnosed with FTLD-Tau. We also localized MFSD8 protein to neurons and astrocytes. Lysosome marker proteins were consistently increased in all FTLD cases relative to controls, while MFSD8 rare variant carriers also had a trend towards an increase in an autophagosome marker protein. Finally, biochemical studies revealed marked disruption of lysosomal function in cells from FTD patients carrying rare missense variants in MFSD8, and demonstrated that at least one rare FTLD-associated variant in MFSD8 resulted in greater cell surface expression. Together, our results suggest that rare variation in MFSD8 may contribute to FTLD risk by altering autophagy and lysosomal function. These key findings are discussed in turn."}, {"section_title": "Gene-level statistical analyses implicate rare variation in MFSD8 as a risk factor for FTLD", "text": "We sought to identify novel genetic risk factors for FTLD and found a suggestive association between FTLD risk and aggregate rare variant burden in MFSD8, a gene encoding a lysosomal membrane protein of unknown function.\nAlthough this finding did not reach exome-wide significance and requires replication in an independent cohort of FTLD cases, we pursued this finding since recessive homozygous pathogenic variants in MFSD8 cause variant late infantile NCL [2, 30, 39, 65] , a rare inherited lysosomal storage disorder that primarily affects children and young adults [29] . Interestingly, even though FTLD is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects older adults, previous studies have identified shared genetic risk factors between NCL and FTLD. Heterozygous GRN pathogenic variants cause about 10% of all FTD cases, while homozygous recessive pathogenic variants in GRN have been linked to recessive adult-onset NCL in two separate families [3, 6, 7, 11, 67, 78] . More recently, Ward et al. provided further evidence for phenotypic overlap between FTLD and NCL due to pathogenic GRN variants by identifying NCL-like biological hallmarks in haploinsufficient GRN patients [73] . Given the relationship of GRN to NCL, rare variation in other NCL genes, including CTSF, has also been suggested to contribute risk to FTD [79] . We identified five FTLD cases heterozygous for MFSD8 rare variants in the present study, suggesting our findings are akin to GRN but with several differences. First, homozygous pathogenic variants in GRN and MFSD8 lead to different types of NCL that occur during different stages of life; GRN homozygous variants lead to adult NCL whereas MFSD8 homozygous variants lead to late infantile NCL [47] . Also unlike GRN, our results support a \"two-hit\" hypothesis in which one rare variant in MFSD8 increases the risk of developing FTLD, but requires an additional \"hit\" before FTLD may develop. This is further supported by the identification of two rare variants in clinically normal controls that cause early termination codons in MFSD8, both of which are predicted to be loss of function variants in the Genome Aggregation Database. Thus, our findings support a role for rare variants in MFSD8 increasing FTLD risk, but suggest these variants are unable to cause disease in the absence of another, as yet undetermined risk factor. Beyond being linked to the neurologic defects observed in FTD and NCL, pathogenic variants in both MFSD8 and GRN have also been linked to vision defects and neuronal loss in the retina [59, 74] . A family study previously linked both the E381X and E336Q variants in MFSD8 to individuals with nonsyndromic autosomal recessive macular dystrophy [59] . The same study also identified the E336Q variant as a risk factor for maculopathies and cone disorders, and suggested that this hypomorphic variant may cause cone dysfunction in combination with a more severe variant in MFSD8, such as the E381X variant. Although this is similar to the \"two-hit\" model we propose for how rare variants in MFSD8 may contribute to FTLD risk, further studies of larger cohorts are required to elucidate if the missense variants that we identified in FTLD cases, particularly E336Q, may lead to disease in combination with other risk factors."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "To the best of our knowledge, the only rare variant identified in this study that has previously been linked to NCL is the stop-gain variant, E381X [2] (Table S3 ). In the current study, a clinically normal control from the ADSP cohort was found to be heterozygous for this variant. We were unable to verify this variant with Sanger sequencing since the data for this participant was derived from a public source, and we did not have access to clinical data for this participant that might indicate any abnormal vision or neurological symptoms. Future studies will be critical to establishing the clinical significance of the five rare variants in MFSD8 that we identified in FTLD cases."}, {"section_title": "MFSD8 rare variant carriers display elevated levels of MFSD8 protein", "text": "We observed increased MFSD8 protein levels in MFG of MFSD8 rare variant carrier patients relative to sporadic FTLD patients and controls, and MFSD8 immunoreactivity was generally strongest in the cytoplasm of neurons across all diagnostic groups. Since MFG is affected by neurodegeneration in FTLD, it is possible that disrupting MFSD8 function may contribute to some of the pathological changes observed in FTLD. Similar observations have been made in studies of post-mortem brain tissue from NCL patients, where individuals with homozygous loss of function variants in MFSD8 show the earliest signs of neuronal loss and prominent neuronal accumulation of autofluorescent ceroid material in regions with the highest expression levels of MFSD8 mRNA, as identified in rat brains [62] . Thus, the elevated expression levels of MFSD8 protein in MFG of rare variant carrier cases relative to controls and sporadic FTLD cases suggest that MFSD8 may be playing a direct role in the pathobiology of FTLD in these cases."}, {"section_title": "MFSD8 rare variant carriers display changes in autophagic/lysosomal markers", "text": "Our experimental results from immunoblots of autophagosomal and lysosomal proteins in post-mortem tissue from MFSD8 rare variant carriers and mouse brain homogenates, and the marked decrease in lysosomal-dependent degradation in cells from MFSD8 rare variant carriers support a role for MFSD8 in the autophagic/lysosomal system. Malfunctioning autophagy has been extensively demonstrated in a large number of neurodegenerative conditions, including FTLD [21, 43, 44, 48] , and experimental disruption of autophagy in neurons leads to rapid neurodegeneration [19, 28] . Autophagic failure in the context of neurodegeneration may occur at different steps of this process, including defects at the level of cargo recognition, delivery of cargo due to impaired autophagosome formation or defective autophagosome/lysosomal fusion, translocation of cargo across the lysosomal membrane, or degradation of cargo in lysosomes [44, 48, 75] . The increased levels of the autophagosome marker LC3-II in post-mortem tissue together with the higher number of LC3 positive vesicles and marked reduction in lysosomal-dependent degradation rates observed in cells from MFSD8 rare variant carriers suggest that autophagosome clearance, an important step in autophagy, may be affected in these patients. Finally, we found a higher abundance of Mfsd8 in the group of lysosomes usually engaged in CMA. Together, these findings suggest that MFSD8 plays a role in autophagy and, probably more specifically, in CMA. However, detailed analyses of different types of autophagy in Mfsd8 knock-out mice and human cells derived from MFSD8 rare variant carriers are required to confirm involvement of MFSD8 in these degradative pathways."}, {"section_title": "Rare missense variants associated with FTLD risk alter intracellular trafficking of MFSD8", "text": "MFSD8 is a protein of unknown structure and function, making it difficult to assess the functional consequences of the five FTLD-associated rare missense variants identified in our study. However, previous studies suggest it belongs to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of proteins and may function as a lysosomal membrane transporter [62, 65] . We used biochemical techniques to begin characterizing how rare missense variants in MFSD8 may alter protein function. These studies revealed a significant increase in cell surface accumulation for the F379S variant of MFSD8, and similar changes for the G385R variant of MFSD8. Multiple lysosomal trafficking pathways exist for delivering proteins to lysosomes, including a direct route from the trans-Golgi network, and an indirect route via the plasma membrane with subsequent endocytosis [60] . MFSD8 has previously been shown to predominantly reach the lysosome via the indirect route with clathrin-mediated endocytosis [68] . The F379S variant may lead to reduced MFSD8 function in lysosomes by disrupting its intracellular trafficking. This variant may also modify glycosylation of MFSD8 at an immediately upstream N-linked glycosylation site (amino acids 376 NTT 378 ) in a proposed lysosomal luminal loop [68] . This is supported by the observed increase in abundance of a lower molecular weight band on the immunoblot of cell surface MFSD8 (* in Fig. 4) . Although the role of these glycosylation sites in normal MFSD8 function is unknown, disrupting glycosylation may alter MFSD8's putative function as a lysosomal transporter. Future studies will be important for determining whether there are additional consequences of the F379S variant on MFSD8 function beyond increasing cell surface accumulation and possibly altering glycosylation of MFSD8 and, more importantly, how these changes contribute to FTLD pathobiology.\nBeyond disrupting intracellular trafficking of MFSD8, rare missense variants may affect MFSD8 function by disrupting protein structure. Since there is no crystal structure of MFSD8, we used a previously reported computational prediction of MFSD8's membrane topology to determine in which domains our FTLD-associated variants are located [65] (Fig. S5) . Two variants fall in putative transmembrane domain alpha helices (S217G and I492T), one near the membrane-cytosol interface (E336Q), and two in a large loop facing the lysosomal lumen (F379S and G385R). Since alpha helical transmembrane domains are critical structural components that facilitate the transport function of MFS proteins [32, 53] , amino acid substitutions in or near these domains may distort the structure of MFSD8 and affect its putative transport function. Previous studies have also suggested that loop regions in transporters may be important for stabilizing different conformational states of the protein [18] , and in MFS transporters specifically, for transmitting conformational changes throughout the protein during substrate transport [40] . Thus, amino acid substitutions in loop domains may also disrupt MFSD8's ability to transport substrates. Future identification of a substrate for MFSD8 will be necessary not only to elucidate any functional consequences of the rare variants we identified associated with FTLD risk, but also to determine the functional role of MFSD8 in lysosomes. These roles include a range of putative functions from maintenance of lysosomal pH to lysosomal calcium storage, or even efflux of small macromolecules or peptides resulting from protein breakdown. It is also interesting to keep in mind that MFSD8 may function outside the lysosomal compartment. In this respect, the Human Protein Atlas describes a fraction of MFSD8 that is detected in the nucleoplasm. We observed nuclear MFSD8 immunoreactivity in neurons and fibroblasts of controls and FTD patients carrying MFSD8 rare variants. The pathogenic relevance of the nuclear accumulation of MFSD8 requires further investigation."}, {"section_title": "Rare variation in MFSD8 may result in TDP-43 or tau pathology through differing mechanisms linked to lysosomal dysfunction", "text": "Given the link between NCL and FTD through GRN, we expected that variation in MFSD8 might contribute more risk to FTLD-TDP since GRN is associated with TDP-43 pathology in the brain; nevertheless, MFSD8 rare variants were observed in both FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau cases. This raises the possibility that MFSD8 variants may contribute to either TDP-43 or tau pathology through distinct mechanisms. For example, MFSD8 may play a more direct role in the cellular response to aggregated TDP-43 protein in neurons, whereas its function may be indirectly involved with the response to tau aggregates in neurons and glia. Both scenarios are consistent with a role for MFSD8 in overall protein clearance as is suggested by our protein degradation studies in cultured cells. Whether additional genetic risk factors modify a propensity to develop tau versus TDP-43 pathology remains an open question, and future studies will be required to elucidate putative differences in the role of MFSD8 in the different pathological subtypes of FTLD."}, {"section_title": "Overall considerations", "text": "While our findings provide compelling evidence for the contribution of MFSD8 to FTLD risk and pathobiology, several limitations exist when interpreting our results. First, although rare protein-altering variants in MFSD8 occurred at a higher frequency in our FTLD patients relative to controls, we also identified clinically normal older controls carrying MFSD8 rare variants. This finding is consistent with rare variation in MFSD8 increasing the risk of developing FTLD, but likely not being the sole disease-causing pathogenic variant (e.g., in an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance). Second, even though our study design included patients of European descent, we cannot exclude the possibility of ascertainment bias since participants in both genetic analyses were recruited and diagnosed at the same research center. Our study also included samples sequenced by different methods at five different sequencing centers. Although we observed sufficient depth of coverage for reliable variant calling across samples analyzed by whole genome and whole exome sequencing (> 30 \u00d7), we cannot eliminate the possibility of technical variability leading to differences in variant detection across samples or false-negative findings in the unbiased discovery study. Confirming that rare variation in MFSD8 is associated with increased FTD risk will require replication in large, independent FTD cohorts that include patients from non-European populations, and that are sequenced by the same method at a single facility. The former may be particularly relevant since recent studies found recessive pathogenic variants in MFSD8 linked to NCL cases in South America and China [27] . Finally, post-mortem tissue was only available from five MFSD8 rare variant carriers. Further work is required with additional samples to assess whether there are biological differences across different genetic variants that may contribute to heterogeneity in risk penetrance and protein pathology.\nIn summary, we provide evidence suggesting that rare variants in MFSD8 are associated with FTLD risk. This statistical enrichment was corroborated by experimental studies showing elevated protein levels for MFSD8 and a consistent increase in lysosome and autophagosome marker proteins in MFG of MFSD8 rare variant carriers. We also found marked disruption of lysosomal function in cells from FTD patients carrying rare missense variants in MFSD8. Overall, these findings support a role for autophagy and lysosomal dysfunction in the pathobiology of FTLD. MFSD8 may generally be altered in the context of FTLD, either directly or indirectly through its yet-to-be-determined function. Future studies elucidating the specific function of MFSD8 in lysosomes will help determine if modulating lysosomal function, possibly through MFSD8, may be a viable therapeutic strategy for modifying FTLD trajectories."}]
