[{"section_title": "", "text": "Approximately 3.5 million cases of nonmelanoma skin cancers (eg, basal and squamous cell carcinomas) are diagnosed in the United States annually, 1 making it the most common cancer. 2 An estimated 1 in 5 Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime. 3 The incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancers has doubled among young adults in the United States 4 concomitant with increased UV radiation (UVR) exposure to natural sunlight and artificial tanning devices. 5, 6 There is evidence for a dose-response relationship between use of tanning beds and risk of basal-cell carcinoma, in particular, with a stronger association for younger age of exposure. 7 Indoor tanning is an expanding $5-billion industry, serving .30 million clients annually, including 2.3 million adolescents. [8] [9] [10] [11] Tanning-bed use has been associated with a 1.5-fold increased risk of basal cell carcinoma, a 2.5-fold increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma, 12 and up to a threefold increased risk of melanoma, particularly with use before 30 years of age. [13] [14] [15] Based on Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results data, there has been an increase in the incidence of cutaneous melanoma over the past 2 decades in the United States. 16 The American Cancer Society estimated that 76 250 new melanoma cases in the United States would be diagnosed in 2012. 17 Melanoma was the third most common cancer diagnosed among adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 39 years, and women had a 69% higher risk of melanoma compared with men. 18 This greater melanoma risk among women coincided with increased tanning-bed use among female adolescents, who consistently reported more frequent indoor tanning than male adolescents. 5 According to the US Department of Health and Human Services and the International Agency for Research on Cancer, UVR is carcinogenic to humans, equivalent to arsenic and asbestos. 15, 19 However, tanning devices are considered to be Class I medical devices, the same designation given to bandages and tongue depressors, which allows manufacturers an exemption from mandatory performance standards. 20 Overexposure or frequent exposure to UV-A and UV-B radiation is associated with premature photoaging, skin cancer, and ocular damage. 21 Many tanning facilities market \"nonburning\" devices equipped with bulbs that primarily emit UV-A radiation (380-420 nm) 22 that causes potentially mutagenic oxidative damage to DNA. 23 To increase exposure over shorter time intervals, high-pressure tanning devices use bulbs that emit UV-A radiation 10 to 15 times that of noontime sunlight. 24 Furthermore, UV-A-induced \"tanning\" is due to the redistribution of preexisting melanin that affords minimal UVR photoprotection. [25] [26] [27] However, many individuals assume that these devices provide photoprotection before ambient UVR exposure.\nBecause of the rising rate of melanoma in younger individuals, [28] [29] [30] and the role of UVR in pathogenesis, the World Health Organization stated that persons aged ,18 should not use tanning devices. 31 The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that persons 10 to 24 years of age should reduce UVR exposure by engaging in sun-protective behaviors including the use of broadspectrum sunscreen and avoidance of indoor tanning. 32 The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) endorses eye protection, visible warning signs, informed consent, skin assessments before tanning-bed use, and compliance with manufacturer operational instructions. As of March 2012, only 33 states had regulatory laws enforcing some or all of these guidelines, 33 many of which lack adequate restrictions for minors. In 2012, California became the first state to ban use of tanning devices among all minors ,18 years. In the remaining 17 states, including Missouri, any individual or entity may market tanning beds without regulatory oversight to enforce the safety standards just described.\nFew studies have evaluated the practices of indoor-tanning facilities in states lacking regulations. In those studies published, tanning-facility operators were found to be inadequately trained in the use of tanning equipment, 34 to misinform consumers about the potential hazards of UVR, 35 and to be lenient with FDA guidelines. 36 We sought to evaluate the practices of tanning facilities in Missouri, a state without indoor-tanning regulations. We examined whether these businesses acted in accordance with FDA recommendations and consistently imparted information to potential clients about the known risks of UVR."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "In July 2007, we identified cities within each of the 115 Missouri counties by using the National Association of Counties Web site. 37 The city of St Louis is considered to be a county equivalent (ie, 1 of the 115 counties). We used 2 Internet search engines 38, 39 to identify tanning facilities in each city by using the search word \"tanning.\" In this way, we identified 831 unique indoortanning facilities in Missouri in July 2007; 21 counties had no tanning facilities listed, and facilities with duplicate telephone numbers or addresses were included only once. We planned to survey a random sample of half the total number of tanning facilities identified. The number of facilities selected from each county was proportional to the county' s population in 2006 as determined by the US Census Bureau. 40 After compiling a list of salons for each county, the desired number of facilities for each county was selected randomly with a randomnumber generator. If a county had fewer tanning salons than desired, all available facilities in that county were included. Therefore, our final sample included 375 tanning facilities in 94 counties.\nTo describe differences in counties that were included and excluded in the sample, all Missouri counties were classified as metropolitan or nonmetropolitan by using the US Department of Agriculture's 2003 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes. 41 We also geocoded the street addresses of each tanning facility to be able to describe population characteristics of the census tracts in which these facilities conducted business.\nAfter approval by the Institutional Review Board at Washington University, each tanning facility was interviewed twice by phone, on different days and times, by 2 trained medical students who posed as potential customers. A standard script was created to sound like an adolescent conversation; the script was slightly modified (Table 1) for each interviewer to avoid raising suspicion among employees who might have responded to both calls. Data were collected anonymously, and responses were recorded into a spreadsheet.\nInterviewer A conducted the survey from 7 AM to 3 PM, and Interviewer B performed the survey from 3 PM to 10 PM. The first call to any facility could have taken place either in the morning or evening. Interviews were conducted from July through September 2007, with a maximum of 5 attempts made to contact each salon by each interviewer.\nWe coded the content of information given to the interviewers regarding the risks associated with artificial UVR devices and about specific practices that were allowed (eg, duration of exposure to UVR-emitting devices, age restrictions, requirements or recommendations for protective eyewear or sunscreen). A numerical code was created ( Table 2 ) that grouped responses into broader categories. In this way, it was possible to assign multiple codes to any given response. For example, a response such as, \"UVR may cause sunburns, premature wrinkling, or skin cancer\" would be coded as 3 (UVR damage, which included sunburns and premature wrinkling) and 4 (skin cancer). We used these codes to determine whether the same information was provided to the callers at both times. Each interviewer independently coded both sets of data. Code-assigning discrepancies occurred 6 times among 3270 assigned codes, for a 99.8% agreement in coding between raters. Discrepant responses were reevaluated and discussed, and a consensus on coding was reached between the interviewers. Only the agreed-on set of codes was analyzed.\nFacilities that completed both interviews were included in analysis ( 43 ; both are used to test the null hypothesis that responses in 2 related variables (eg, 2 interviews of the same tanning salon at different times) do not differ significantly. Two-tailed P , .05 was considered significant.\nWe examined selection bias for inclusion and for the number of interviews that salons completed (ie, completed 0, 1, or 2 interviews) by their location in either metropolitan or nonmetropolitan counties by using x 2 tests. We created a 5-item, censustract-level poverty index by using principal components analysis and report the reliability of this scale by using Cronbach' s a. We also examined whether census-tract-level poverty differed by the number of completed interviews by using analysis of variance."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Of 375 indoor-tanning facilities selected for inclusion, 243 (65%) in 81 counties completed both interviews and were included in the analysis (Table 3) .

Despite the scientific evidence linking UVRto the development ofskincancer, 44, 45 43% of tanning salons in our study claimed that there were no risks associated with indoor tanning, and 78% did not require skin assessments ) . Interestingly, in our study, tanning services were offered at unusual venues such as fitness centers, floral shops, video rental stores, travel agencies, and laundromats, where employees would not be expected to specialize in tanning-bed operation.\nIn 2010, the Federal Trade Commission charged the Indoor Tanning Association with propagating deceptive safety and health claims regarding indoor tanning. 46 The Federal Trade Commission subsequently issued a consumer alert stating that tanning devices can lead to skin cancer and are more dangerous than the sun, discounting purported health benefits advertised by the tanning industry. 47 There is growing evidence that melanoma risk is associated with tanning bed use. A recent population-based, case-control study found a 74% increased likelihood of melanoma with 1-time use of tanning beds compared with never-users, and risk increased with repeated use and high-intensity tanning devices. 44 Similar increases in melanoma risk with repeated use and younger age at initiation were also reported in western Europe. 48 To our knowledge, this study is the largest single-state survey of tanning facilities conducted in a state without regulatory laws for indoor-tanning facilities. A small survey of 20 facilities in New York City in the late 1980s showed that up to 80% of operators informed customers that artificial tanning would not cause sunburns or skin cancer, 49 similar to our results nearly 30 years later, despite scientific evidence to the contrary. Inspection of Arkansas tanning salons revealed poor eye protection and inadequate limits on exposure time; consumers with Fitzpatrick skin type II were also promised a \"safe\" UV-A tan that would protect against sunburns. 50 In another study, .70% of tanning-facility operators had never received training for their positions and were often unaware of contraindications to tanning. 34 Other studies have reported that salons exceed the number of sessions allowed per week 51 and that only 5% of facilities were in compliance with recommended manufacturer tanning schedules, whereas 100% offered \"unlimited\" tanning packages. 10 Although other studies have reported what tanningfacility employees say to their patrons, ours is unique in reporting the intrasalon consistency of information provided to potential clients in a statewide, random sample of tanning salons.\nThis study had some limitations. Because data were collected anonymously, we did not know whether we interviewed the same person both times, so the unit of analysis was the tanning salon and not the individual employee. In addition, the survey elicited responses to open-ended questions. We did not ask each employee whether he or she gives specific types of information to potential customers (eg, we did not ask each employee if he or she told a customer that skin cancer is a risk of indoor tanning). Employees spontaneously mentioned the responses we report here. Furthermore, because this was a descriptive study and was conducted in only 1 state without tanning-salon legislation, we cannot generalize our results to other states or to states that have passed tanningsalon legislation. In-person surveillance may be pursued in future studies to measure actual practice. Our data were collected in 2007; however, we believe that our results reflect the status quo of tanning-facility operation in Missouri, which, to this day, lacks indoor-tanning legislation. In 2007, we could not locate any governmental registry of tanning facilities in Missouri to verify the total number of facilities in operation. It is unknown whether additional facilities were unlisted online, but we found no evidence of selection bias by location of facilities in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan counties or in census tracts with varying levels of poverty.\nWe propose that for some individuals, without limiting access, there may be little incentive to change behaviors. Indeed, the enactment of smoke-free laws, for example, succeeded in promoting smoking cessation within local communities. 52 In 2008, we began an aggressive campaign to establish statewide legislation to promote awareness and safety among tanningbed users in Missouri, which is still underway and proving to be a slow process. Essential components of our proposed legislation include (1) enforcement of FDA recommendations for tanning-bed operators (eg, warning signs, mandatory eye protection, manufacturer compliance), (2) enforcement of age restrictions prohibiting children aged ,18 years from using tanning devices, and (3) providing the same information to all consumers before tanning-bed use. Although the Health Care Reform Act enacted in 2010 included a 10% tax on tanning services, such an intervention may not be sufficient to restrict use of tanning services because it has had a minimal effect on decreasing the frequency of indoor tanning. 53 We also believe that tanning devices should be elevated to either a Class II or III category for medical devices, which would at least require regulatory oversight of manufacturers. Furthermore, because the majority of adolescents who use tanning beds are older (16 to 18 years old), 5 there is a need for higher age restrictions in states with existent laws. As physicians and patient advocates, we should be at the forefront of educating parents, implementing community programs, and supporting legislation that protects children and adults from the harmful effects of UVR-emitting devices. Consumer and patient education regarding the dangers of indoor tanning are paramount in skin cancer prevention."}]
