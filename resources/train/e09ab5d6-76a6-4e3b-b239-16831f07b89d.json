Thereafter, intragroup differences were analyzed by Student's t tests and Mann-Whitney tests. Differences between the hypertensive and non-hypertensive groups were analyzed by Student's t tests and Mann-Whitney tests. The influences of age, gender, race, and hypertension status on olfactory functional categories were analyzed by Chisquare tests and Fisher's exact tests. Differences in the frequency of responses to the chemosensory questionnaire according to age, gender, racial group, and hypertension status were evaluated by Chi-square tests and Fisher's exact test. The responses of \"improved\" or \"no change\" were combined and analyzed as \"no change\".

Older persons, regardless of race, had lower UPSIT scores, were more likely to be microsmic and anosmic, and had increased chemosensory complaints. Overall, smell performance among females was higher compared with males; however, these differences were not statistically significant. Racial comparisons revealed that Caucasians had higher UPSIT and adjusted percentile rank scores, were less likely to be smell-impaired, and had increased complaints of smell problems. In general, racial differences were most evident in the young groups, with no differences observed in the older groups with the exception of the chemosensory questions. Young and old African-Americans in this study had no complaints of smell problems. Finally, in a small group of older Caucasians with well-controlled hypertension and taking one antihypertensive drug, smell identification was further impaired.\nThese age-related findings are consistent with previous studies demonstrating that smell identification declines with increased age. 4, 12, 14, 15, 30, 31 Despite the small sample size in this study, age-related olfactory function deficits were detected in healthy AfricanAmericans and Caucasians. These declines support an anatomic and physiologic basis for age-related changes in smell ability, which is not yet completely underst00d.l~ Histological studies suggest that the olfactory epithelium of older persons may be less resistant to damaging viral attack^.'^,'^-^\" In addition to changes in the central neural pathways, poor oral hygiene and impaired oral health may also contribute to age-related decreases in olfactory function.12,22 ally higher than those in males, but these differences were not significant. Interestingly, elderly Caucasian males scored slightly higher than elderly Caucasian females. The lack of gender differences in the present study may be due, in part, to a small sample size. Previous studies have demonstrated superior olfactory function in f e m a l e~, 4 ,~,~~ including healthy populations.12 When the UPSIT was administered to four different ethnic groups in one study, women consistently outperformed men to the same relative degree.5 It is not yet known why olfaction is influenced by gender, although several hypotheses have been stated. Deems et al. ' suggested that estrogen has a prophylactic effect on the integrity of the olfactory epithelium, protecting it from viral or toxic insults.\nRacial differences existed in smell identification in the present study, but only in the young group. Doty et al.5 used a considerably larger sample size, yet also found racial differences. However, Doty's cohorts were not age-matched. Doty et aL5 collected UPSIT scores from four racial groups: American Koreans (92% correct), American Caucasians (87% correct), African-Americans (83% correct), and native Japanese (78% correct). Cultural variations in food preparation and smell and taste preference3 may account for the racial results observed in the present study and previous reports. In addition, environmental factors as well as cultural differences in familiarity with the test odors may have yielded race-dependent findings. Interestingly, the odorants most often incorrectly identified by the African-American population Female UPSIT scores were generin the present study were fruit punch (34% young African-Americans, 64% old African-Americans), cheddar cheese (41% young AfricanAmericans, 50% old AfricanAmericans), and coconut (37% young African-Americans, 32% old AfricanAmericans). Doty et ~1 .~ observed that the odorant most likely to be incorrectly identified in all cultural groups was fruit punch.\nNumerous systemic diseases and medications have been reported to alter the perception of sme11.2,25-27 In the present study, significantly greater UPSIT scores were found in healthy elderly Caucasians compared with subjects with well-controlled hypertension; however, these differences were not evident in the African-American population. Interestingly, the three anosmic subjects in the study were older subjects treated for hypertension (two African-Americans, one Caucasian), whereas none of the healthy elderly was anosmic. However, the small sample size and the use of several different anti-hypertensive medications preclude the establishment of any relationships between hypertension and olfactory dysfunction. It is interesting, nevertheless, that previous studies2 have reported that hypertensive individuals have increased complaints of absent or diminished taste, especially for salt.\nSchiffman et a1.2 demonstrated that the elderly have difficulty discerning differences in salt concentrations, and reported an 11.6-fold greater salt detection threshold in older compared with younger persons. of smell problems than AfricanAmericans. There is no readily-available explanation why AfricanAmericans had no complaints of smell problems. It is suggested that a Likert scale be utilized in future studies to assess chemosensory comp l a i n t~.~~ The sensitivity for the changesmell question was low for both racial groups (AfricanAmericans O%, Caucasians 25%), whereas the specificity was high (African-Americans loo%, Caucasians 90%). The results for the Caucasians had more complaints question changetaste were similar: low sensitivities (African-American Q%, Caucasians 25%) and high specificities (African-Americans 96%, Caucasians 94%). These findings indicate that the complaint of a smell problem does not necessarily indicate smell dysfunction. The high specificity establishes that normosmic individuals do not complain of chemosensory disturbances. These observations are consistent with those of previous studies.1,12,2R Goodspeed ct 0 1 .~~ observed that patients who sought medical care for chemosensory disorders were unable to describe their chemosensory problem accurately. In general, many individuals are unable to distinguish between taste and smell.1J2~28 Individuals speak often of \"tasting food\", yet olfaction may contribute more than taste to the eating experie n~e .~~ Chemosensory disorders are caused by many factors, and may not necessarily reflect an olfactory or gustatory deficit. Therefore, it is imperative that these individuals receive thorough medical attention.\nIt is difficult to make generalizations about smell identification based upon this small study population. Because race is a multidimensional con~truct?~ future studies are clearly necessary to determine if race, culture, and ethnicity are significant attributes which influence chemosensory function. In addition, longitudinal studies are necessary to observe olfactory function in healthy people and individuals with systemic disease, to establish the influence of aging and disease on chemosensory performance."}]
