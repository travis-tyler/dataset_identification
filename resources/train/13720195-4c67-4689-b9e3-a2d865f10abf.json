[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, has spread globally reaching all continents1,2. Ecuador was the second country in South America, after Brazil, to report its first case on 29 February 20203. The number has grown since, reaching 39,098 laboratory-confirmed cases and 3,358 deaths until May 31st, 2020 4. The pandemic has had a severe impact in Ecuador, as death excess estimates suggest that up to 182.44 people per million inhabitants may have died since the first COVID19 case 5, making Ecuador the country with the highest mortality rate in South America.\nQuito, the capital city of Ecuador, was the second city to report COVID-19 cases after Guayaquil. After a severe wave of cases in Guayaquil during the early stages of the outbreak, Quito currently reports the largest number of COVID-19 daily cases in the country. The first case in Quito was diagnosed initially in the Sucumb\u00edos province, while the patient was doing tourism, and was subsequently brought to a third-level hospital in the capital. The patient is originally from the Netherlands and was diagnosed by the Health Ministry on March 10th, 2020. His condition deteriorated while in Sucumb\u00edos, prompting his transfer to Quito where he was admitted into the Intensive Care Unit of the Eugenio Espejo Hospital. After 32 days, the patient recovered and returned to his native country. Currently, local authorities have confirmed 3676 cases 4 and widespread community transmission is actively happening.\nUnderstanding the local epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 can greatly be enhanced from understanding the virus evolution. It is therefore relevant to invest in SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing as it could help to establish the origin of the pathogen 6, its transmission across different regions 7, the genetic diversity of the circulating strains in the population and to identify notable mutations 8. Additionally, key biological aspects such as virulence, transmissibility and infectivity of the circulating strains can be investigated, when combined with clinical data from the patients 7. Around 35,473 genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported from countries around the world and are available in GenBank and the GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) repository 9.\nIn this work we describe the first four SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences obtained from Ecuador. We also report the metagenomic analysis of the first COVID-19 patient diagnosed in Quito. Both approaches were performed using the portable MinION platform (Oxford Nanopore Technologies)."}, {"section_title": "Ethics ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "This study used excess respiratory samples after being officially confirmed with positive COVID19 diagnosis.

Sample HEE-01 was a bronchi-alveolar lavage (BAL) from a patient of Dutch origin in his late fifties who presented symptoms during a visit to the Sucumbios province and then transferred to the HEE intensive care unit (ICU) in Quito. This patient was the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Quito. Samples HGSQ-USFQ-018, HGSQ-USFQ-007 and HGSQ-USFQ-010 were all nasopharyngeal swabs. HGSQ018 was collected from a 27 years old male patient who presented severe COVID-19 symptoms after a visit to Guayaquil and was admitted to the pneumology unit at HGSQ. Sample HGSQ-USFQ-007 was collected from a 40 years old male patient that had no history or contact with a COVID-19 patient, presented severe COVID19 symptoms and was admitted to ICU at HGSQ. Sample HGSQ-USFQ-010 was collected from a 39 years old male patient that had contact with patient HGSQ-USFQ-007 and was also admitted to ICU. The BAL sample was collected in a sterile tube with 2X DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo), and nasopharyngeal swabs were submerged in 1X DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo) to ensure virus inactivation and to preserve the genetic material.

HEE-01 was assigned to the B lineage and grouped with sequences from the Netherlands (Figure 2). Strain HGSQ-USFQ-018 was obtained from a case detected in Quito, but the infection was presumably acquired in Guayaquil. It shows nine nucleotide differences with the reference genome (Table 1). This genome is placed in the B.1 lineage and grouped with genomes from other European countries (Figure 2). Finally, HGSQ-USFQ-007, a community acquired infection in Quito, and the sequence from an epidemiologically-linked contact (HGSQ-USFQ-010) were also placed in the B lineage. Both sequences have multiple differences compared to the reference strain, including 17 amino acids replacement and one amino acid deletion (Table 1)."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "The mitigation of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been unsuccessful in most South American countries. Countries like Ecuador, where the population, despite shocking examples in other cities like Guayaquil, continues to react in disbelief at an imminent risk. It is now when scientific research is needed to guide the authorities to develop correct public health policies. In this study, we were able to uncover the first 4 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences from Ecuador using the portable low-cost MinION platform (Oxford Nanopore). Genome sequences, from the first COVID19 case reported in Quito, have few differences compared to the reference strain (Wuhan-Hu-1), and is grouped within lineage B near sequences from patients in the Netherlands. This finding confirms that the patient most likely acquired the infection in his country of origin. Metagenome sequencing of the patient\u2019s BAL revealed possible bacterial coinfection as several of the microorganisms are not considered members of the core lower airways bacterial microbiota17. As consequence, the encountered bacteria were probably contributing to the patient\u2019s severe condition. Metagenomic analysis could be crucial in COVID-19 cases because it adds valuable information about concurrent pulmonary pathogens that can aggravate the clinical condition18\u201320.\nacquired the infection at the community level, either in Guayaquil or Quito. All three patients presented severe respiratory symptoms. Sequence recovered from a patient that got infected in Guayaquil grouped in lineage B.1, suggesting a second introduction of the virus into the country. Finally, the virus sequences recovered from two patients infected in Quito had marked differences with the previous sequences, suggesting a third introduction of the virus to the country. These sequences were identical between them, which was expected since the patients were family members, developed symptoms at the similar time and lived together. Furthermore, the distinct set of mutations from these sequences was analyzed in a separate study which reports a potential virulence factor not previously described, which is associated with inhibition of the interferon response in vitro\n21. Community acquired transmission is now widespread in Ecuador and more samples from community acquired infections are needed in order to inform analyses of the local epidemiology of the virus. Comparing these genomes will allow us to provide a more accurate estimate of the arrival times and routes of the virus into certain areas, and to better understand how it is locally spreading and evolving. Revealing the information contained in the SARS-CoV-2 virus genome sequences is a robust tool to understand the epidemiology of COVID-19 locally and contribute to the global panorama.\nThe current pandemic is unlikely to be the last, and it is therefore essential to improve the response capacity of our public health systems and to implement and strengthen continuous scientific research programs. Only in this way we will be able to better understand these types of threats, act based on evidence, and thus reduce their impact."}]
