Approximately 17% of children aged 2 to 19 years-old are classified as obese [i.e., have a body mass index (BMI) above 30 kg m -2 ; (Ogden et al. 2014) ]. There are, however, large disparities in childhood obesity prevalence between racial and ethnic minority groups, and by geographic location, with the highest incidence among Hispanic children (Ogden et al. 2014) and in children residing in the southeast region of the United States (Gopal et al. 2010) . One population at risk is low-income elementary-aged children (Kopelman 2007) , an already vulnerable group whose rates of obesity have steadily increased across all races except Asians/Pacific Islanders, irrespective of gender (Kopelman 2013 ). Socioeconomic inequality is associated with geographically concentrated childhood obesity among low-income groups that may lead to an accumulation of disadvantage for children throughout their life course (Giskes et al. 2008; Power, Manor, and Matthews 2003; Woolf and Aron 2013, p. 233) .\nThe consequences of poor physiological and psychological health extend to the academic domain. An overweight or obese child may succumb to anxiety and depression as a result of social marginalization and/ or peer discrimination due to the stigma associated with being overweight, and, consequently, her math performance may suffer. For example, overweight and obese adolescents are more socially isolated and have fewer friendships than those of normal weight (Strauss and Pollack 2003) . This may then lead to devastating outcomes associated with psychological instability, and, in some cases, lowered academic performance (Robinson 2006) .\nIncreased body weight is associated with decreased cognitive function in school-aged children . Researchers have shown that overweight and obesity in children is associated with deficits in executive function, which relies on proper functioning of the part of the brain responsible for planning and judgment (Cserjesi. Luminet, Molnar, and Lenard 2007; Braet, Claus, Verbeken, and Vlierghe 2007) . Poor math performance, for example, could be due to ineffective planning or the inability to shift from one mental state to another, update working memory, or inhibit impulsive behavior (St Clair-Thompson and Gathercole 2006) . Given that the pathophysiological process of weight-associated complications culminates in cognitive decline and is driven by neural, cardiovascular, endocrine, musculoskeletal, renal, gastrointestinal, and pulmonary system malfunction, in addition to psychosocial problems (Kamijo et al. 2014; Garver et al. 2013) , childhood obesity trends have implications for children's well-being in both the short and long term, including academic outcomes (Daniels et al. 2005; Freedman et al. 2007 ; see Taras and Potts-Datema 2009, for review) . Importantly, academic outcomes are not driven solely by cognitive capacity (Bandura 1993 ), a limited pool of energy, resources, or fuel by which some cognitive processes are mobilized and maintained (Johnson and Heinz, 1978, p.422) . Psychological resources such as optimism, personal control and a sense of meaning are protective for mental health (Frankl 1963; Taylor, 1989; Seligman 1998; Taylor et al. 2000) , and these learned behaviors also assist children in educational achievement (Kolb 1984; Zimmerman 1989; Casey et al. 2005) . Among these psychological resources, self-efficacy-typically conceptualized as perceived judgments of one's capabilities to organize and execute courses of action to attain chosen goals (Bandura 1977 )-has consequences for children's psychological development, educational outcomes, and reproduction of stratification across generations (see Multon et al. 1991 for review; Schunk 1995; Schunk and Pajares 2004) . The role of self-efficacy in shaping the connection between children's math achievement and obesity-related comorbidities has not been examined to date.\nPerceived self-efficacy is the foundation of human motivation (Bandura 1993 (Bandura , 1994 (Bandura , 2006 . At the individual level, symbolic processes through which knowledge is formed may be analyzed as contributing to the production of individual differences in development (Dannefer 1984) . For example, the expectations communicated to, and interpreted by, a child, contribute to self-definition and to her plan of action. Bandura, and other social psychologists, suggest that individual action is driven by the core belief that we can produce desired results through our behavior. Self-efficacy moderates the effect of gender and prior experience on self-concept and mathematical problem solving (Pajares and Miller 1994) . It is also becoming evident that selfefficacy may be an important mechanism in the treatment of obesity (Clark et al. 1991; . In the present study, I examined the relationship between self-efficacy and math achievement in normal weight, overweight, and obese children.\nAs a measure of cognitive function, I used math achievement, and not literacy, scores from kindergarten to eighth grade, because past research indicates that stress associated with variations in physical appearance can decrease math performance in adults Gable et al. 2012) . Also, self-efficacy has been shown to predict math performance for undergraduate college students (Siegel et al. 1985) . I hypothesized that children with consistently heightened BMI scores will have lower math achievement, compared to those of children with lower BMI (Gable et al. 2012 ).\nFurther, self-efficacy has previously been shown to serve as a moderator of weight management (Bandura 2000) , life stressors (Bandura 1994) , and scholastic aptitude (Brown et al. 1989) . Because self-efficacy engenders a wide range of capacities and skills that children may draw upon to support their math achievement-and potentially buffer the effects of increased weight on learning-I expected self-efficacy to factor into this linkage by moderating the extent to which children's increased weight status will affect their math achievement. Thus, I\nhypothesized that, compared to overweight and obese children with lower self-efficacy, those who are overweight and obese but have higher self-efficacy, would score better on math achievement assessments. I tested these hypotheses by applying multilevel growth modeling techniques (Singer and Willet 2003) to data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal StudyKindergarten class 1998-1999 (ECLS-K)."}, {"section_title": "BACKGROUND", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "LINKING OBESITY AND MATH ACHIEVEMENT TO SELF-EFFICACY", "text": "Early childhood health influences later life outcomes (Currie 2009; Currie 2010, 2011) . The current study is predicated on the notion that weight-related comorbidities are associated with cognitive dysfunction. The negative association between obesity and cognitive function is well documented Shore et al. 2008; McLaren 2007) , as is the positive association between self-efficacy and academic outcomes (Zimmerman 2000; Cowen et al. 1991; Bandura 1997) . However, the direct association between self-efficacy and math outcomes among normal weight, overweight, and obese children in the United States has never been examined.\nThere is no consensus on the causal effect of childhood obesity on standardized test scores and academic outcomes. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies examining the association between academic achievement and obesity are inconsistent. Researchers have found no association (Kaetner et al. 2009 ), a negative association (Averett and Stifel 2010) , a mediation between obesity and self-esteem (Tershakovec et al. 1994) , obesity and externalizing behavioral problems (Crosnoe 2007) , and obesity and interpersonal skills (Klinitzke et al. 2013) in poor academic performance. Nonetheless, there is ample theoretical and empirical evidence indicating a likely connection. Thus, my conceptual model is that overweight and obesity in children affects cognitive function and is linked to learning, which in turn affects math academic outcomes.\nSelf-efficacy has emerged as an effective predictor of students' motivation and scholarship. Self-efficacious students contribute more in the classroom, work more assiduously, persevere longer, and have fewer disadvantageous reactions when faced with challenges (Bandura 1997 ). Furthermore, measures of self-efficacy are highly correlated with achievement in academic work and persistence (Zimmerman 2000) . Evidence of the predictive ability of selfefficacy in children is demonstrated in cognitive tasks, including math performance (Cowen et al. 1991) . For example, Schnuck et al. (1985) found a positive association between perceived self-efficacy and rate of accurate arithmetic solutions. Thus, research to date clearly links selfefficacy and math achievement (Bandura 1997; Shnuck et al. 1985; Pajares and Kranzler 1995; Adeyinka et al. 2007) . Increased self-efficacy may, then, condition the link between overweight or obesity and children's achievement by buffering (or minimizing) the risks that increased weight status poses to children's math performance."}, {"section_title": "DATA AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data and Sample", "text": "Analyses are based on the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten class 1998-1999 (ECLS-K), a nationally representative sample of 21,260 children from kindergarten to eighth grade, conducted by the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), and designed to study the development of educational stratification among American school children (West, Denton, and Reaney 2000) .

The FIML estimation method assumes data are missing at random (MAR), wherein the conditional covariates are not associated with the propensity for missing data on the outcome measure (i.e., math achievement). This approach maximizes the statistical power for differentiating between math developmental trajectories of children with missing data on the outcome at any wave. The final sample size was 5,034. I used multiple imputation to impute missing values for children who participated in a wave but did not provide a response for a specific independent variable. This method resulted in multiple complete data sets (Allison 2001) . I imputed data using the MIM command, a multivariate imputation program in Stata 13.0 (Carlin, Golati, and Royston 2008). I averaged empirical results across ten imputation samples (Rubin 1987) . The estimates presented here are statistically similar to findings from analyses where I handled missing data for the independent variables using listwise deletion, indicating that estimates are robust across different missing data specifications. All multivariate analyses were conducted using HLM 7.01.\nAt enrollment (kindergarten fall, T1), children (51% female) were identified by parents as 71% White, 5% African American, 15% Hispanic, 5% Asian, and 5% Other Race. In the analyses, ECLS-K data were weighted to account for the multistage probability sampling that oversampled Asians and Pacific Islanders. Weights are provided in the ECLS-K for cross-sectional and longitudinal data analyses; weights were computed for children with complete data on the data points under investigation.

Thirteen statements measuring children's self-perceptions and amount of control they possessed throughout their life were used to assess locus of control. Children scored the items on a continuum from \"strongly agree\" to \"strongly disagree\" for each item; values ranged from -1.53 to 2.50, with higher scores indicating greater perception of control throughout their life. I dichotomized the locus of control measure into low and high levels of self-efficacy, with negative and positive values representing low and high levels of self efficacy, respectively. It is well documented that locus of control and generalized self-efficacy are indicators of the same higher order concept (Judge et al. 2002; Adeyinka et al. 2011) . Internal consistency of the locus of control measure is moderate at the Cronbach Alpha level of 0.68 (Tourangeau et al. 2009 )."}, {"section_title": "Math Achievement", "text": "At each assessment period, children were evaluated in a 50-minute to 70-minute session in kindergarten and 1 st grade, and in a 90-minute session in 3 rd , 5 th , and 8 th grade. The assessment was developed specifically for the ECLS-K, and children were tested on previously used instruments (Woodcock-McGrew-Werder 1996) .\nThe ECLS-K math assessment focused on age-appropriate mathematical knowledge and skills such as knowledge of numbers and shapes, relative size, ordinality and sequence, addition and subtraction, multiplication and division, place value, rate and measurement, fractions, and area and volume (Tourangeau et al. 2009, pp 2-10) . The assessments yielded number right scores, standardized scores, and latent trait scores from item response theory (IRT). I used IRT scores because this assessment placed children's ability on a continuous scale by using the pattern of right, wrong, and omitted responses, and the pattern of difficulty, discriminating ability, and ability to correctly guess each item. Thus, the measure produced a score based on the items a child would have answered correctly if all the questions were answered for that particular assessment. Reliability math scores were high at Cronbach Alpha levels ranging from 0.89 to 0.94 (Tourangeau et al. 2009 )."}, {"section_title": "Covariates", "text": "Time-variant and time-invariant measures were included in the final models.

The estimated coefficients for BMI in these models show the change in math achievement trajectory for children who experienced an increase in BMI. All models were estimated using sampling weights that adjust for the unequal probabilities of selection for children in the ECLS-K. In these models, time points are nested within children.\nThe level-1 model fits BMI as a function of age across the observations for each child, "}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Model 1. Baseline Growth in Math Achievement", "text": "Level 1 "}, {"section_title": "Estimates and Interpretation", "text": "Model 1 estimates of the fixed and random effects are displayed in Table 3 . The estimated coefficients for the fixed effects indicate that children's learning rates increase during early middle childhood and level off during late middle childhood (see the upper portion of Table 3 ). At age 5, the estimated mean math score for children is 17.19. Between the ages of 5 and 9, the average child's math score rapidly increases, evidenced by the large positive values for the liner component of the age slope for math (29.87) and the negative value for the quadratic component of the age slope for math (1.61). However, the rate of increase begins to slow by age 9, whereas by age 11, improvements in mathematics are much more modest than in early middle childhood.\nThe random effects indicate that patterns of growth vary significantly among children (see the lower portion of Table 3 ). Both initial levels of math achievement (\u03c7 2 =10,257, p < 0.001) and the linear (\u03c7 2 =7,217, p < 0.001) and quadratic components (\u03c7 2 =5,692, p < 0.001) of growth vary among children. Ranging from 0.27 for the quadratic components of the learning curves, to 0.36 for the linear component of the curve, estimated reliabilities for the math intercepts and linear and quadratic age slope components are, however, relatively low.\nThe estimated coefficients from this model are displayed in Table 4 . The timeindependent effects of overweight and obesity on children's development are negative. On average, every point increase in BMI beyond normal weight gain is associated with a decline of 0.0001 in children's math achievement trajectory (p <0.001). When a child is overweight, on average, their math achievement score is 5.77 points lower than we would expect if she was normal-weight at 5 years-old (p <0.001), and 7.97 points lower if she was obese (p < 0.001).\nGiven that math achievement rates increase by about 29 points annually, over most of the period, a 5.77 and 7.97 point reduction in math scores is comparable to 2 and 3 months of math learning, respectively.\nAs shown in the lower portion of Table 4 Much of the variability among children in the effects of weight status on math achievement is due to sampling variability that cannot be explained by child characteristics, resulting in low reliabilities for these coefficients.

In this next set of models, I examined the effect of changes in BMI on math achievement, with the added complexity of allowing an additional effect of children crossing into one of the weight status categories (i.e., overweight, obese). I included both dummy variables indicating a child's weight status category and a continuous measure of BMI because I hypothesized that the effect of BMI on math achievement is a complex non-linear function in which each one-point increase in BMI lowers children's math achievement, but that moving from the normal weight to the overweight or from the overweight to the obese category potentially leads to an additional reduction in math achievement."}, {"section_title": "Specification.", "text": "I estimated the effects of weight on children's development trajectories by including three covariates representing the continuous measure of BMI and categorical measures of BMI into the level-1 equation.

Self-efficacy is also included at level 2 as a dichotomous variable indicating whether the child scored high or low in self-efficacy.\nBecause I was primarily interested in how self-efficacy affects math achievement scores in children of varying weight statuses, I allowed only BMI, overweight, and obesity to vary as a function of self-efficacy. Level 1 is the same as the previous model. "}, {"section_title": "Estimates and Interpretation.", "text": "The estimates in Table 5 for this model show that the effects of overweight and obesity vary significantly among children. Partly consistent with hypothesis 2, overweight children's math achievement trajectories benefit with high levels of self-efficacy. On average, the math trajectories of overweight children with high levels of self-efficacy increase by 3.62 points more than those of overweight children with low levels of self-efficacy (p < 0.005). High self-efficacy, by contrast, is not significantly associated with improved math achievement trajectories in obese children (p = 0.73). I calculated and graphed predicted probabilities of math achievement by age and self-efficacy level by weight status (Figure 1) . Racial and ethnic minority children differ significantly from white children in math achievement. African American children's BMI effects on achievement, on average, are 0.00006 more negative (p <0.01) than those of white children. Hispanic children BMI effects are also more negative than those of white children by about 0.00001 points, on average (p = 0.02).\nFemale children have a 0.00002 more negative BMI effects on math achievement compared to male children (p <0.001).

Children who are classified as overweight and have a parent who is a college graduate are 8.23 points higher than overweight children whose parents have dropped out of high school (p = 0.03). Overweight children, on average, who have a parent that received an advanced degree are 9.13 points higher than overweight children whose parents dropped out of high school (p < 0.005).

Overweight and obese children are more likely to suffer from low self-esteem, anxiety disorders, and other psychopathologies (see Zametkin et al. 2004, for review), which may lead to lowered math performance (Judge and Jahns 2007) . However, the causality of this association has yet to be determined. It is possible that mental health problems associated with obesity predispose overweight or obese children to lower academic achievement (Taras and Potts-Datema 2009) , or that obesity is a marker, rather than a cause of low achievement (Datar et al. 2004) . A strong sense of self-efficacy engenders intrinsic interest and deep-seeded involvement in academic activities (Bandura 1994) , and produces a sense of assurance that a child can exercise control over her life.\nMy findings indicate that, on average, overweight and obesity in children coincides with a few point reduction in math achievement, the equivalent of 2 to 3 months of learning.\nOverweight children's math achievement trajectories benefit with high levels of self-efficacy, but, in contrast, high self-efficacy does not produce the same effect in obese children. Results further indicate that the effect of obesity on math achievement is stronger as children age,\nshowing that obese children's lowered math scores are lower relative to normal weight children at older ages than at younger ages. The effect of obesity on math achievement may increase as children age due to extended periods of institutionalized discrimination and weight-related comorbidities that are progressively more pronounced as children age (Dietz 1998) . Thus, in order for self-efficacy to act as a moderator on math achievement trajectories, the onset of obesity is critical. Given that the developmental detriments of overweight on math achievement learning trajectories are moderated by self-efficacy, a learned behavior, intervention timing is crucial.\nWhy are children most in need of the gains associated with self-efficacy the least likely to benefit? It is possible that the stigma, affective disorders, and social isolation associated with obesity have a stronger impact on obese children, and, thus, may impede the ability of selfefficacy to act as a moderator in the child's math achievement. For example, the stresses associated with overweight are stronger for an obese child due to her higher weight status, and, thus, she may experience more social disadvantages, overwhelming the already more constrained child. In contrast, overweight children may experience less of these social disadvantages as a result of being closer to normal weight children in appearance, and are thus more likely to benefit from self-efficacy as a resource in adapting to the complexities and challenges of heightened BMI. It is also possible that because childhood obesity is stigmatized and obese children are viewed as unhealthy and lazy (Crandall and Schiffhauer 1998; Frisco et al. 2010) , these children interpret and internalize the negative communications of others in their construction of self-definition, and lowered math achievement becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nAlthough this is the first study to systematically examine self-efficacy as a moderator of math achievement in overweight and obese children, this study has limitations. First, because of data limitations, self-efficacy was measured at a single time point even though it may fluctuate due to varied and varying psychological and physiological factors that were not measured in this data set. For example, differential sensitivity and tolerance to negative peer influences are associated with varying psychological effects, with the most socially connected children being the least negatively affected by their increased weight status (Gable et al. 2012) . It has also been shown that weight perceptions have a stronger association with depressive symptoms than actual weight status in adolescents (Frisco et al. 2010) . Second, only seven waves of data are available in the ECLS-K 1998-1999 cohort, and therefore, power to identify complex nonlinear relationships between overweight and obesity and child's development is limited. Third, estimated reliabilities for the weight coefficients in the individual-level equations are low.\nConsequently, the ability to detect significant associations between child characteristics and the estimated effects of overweight and obesity on children's developmental trajectories is attenuated. Fourth, there is no consensus on the causal effect of childhood obesity on standardized test scores and math outcomes, but, there is a clear link between obesity and cognitive function. As such, more research is necessary to find mechanisms underlying cognitive decline associated with overweight and obesity. This knowledge may help elucidate the relationship between increased weight status and lower math achievement in children. Fifth, emphasis of my research is on the \"normal\" weight status in children, and any interpretation of such an obscure socially constructed and variable pattern is limited in that its contribution is inevitably a by-product of the social reality it describes. Thus, interpretations are always vulnerable to overstating the importance of eventful change and to minimizing the complex continuities of people's lives. Finally, I have focused on child-level attributes as precursors for math outcomes and learning trajectories. I did not, however, consider other relevant factors of Self-efficacy, Weight, and Children's Math Achievement children's math outcomes such as parent-child and teacher-child relationships or educational context, despite that these factors likely influence children's math achievement and self-efficacy.\nDespite these limitations, current findings illuminate the importance of psychological resources, particularly self-efficacy, on math achievement trajectories in children. Previous research has shown self-efficacy to act as a moderator across a number of outcomes (Brown et al. 1989; Matsui and Onglatco 1992; Bandura 1994; Bandura 2000; Brown et al. 2001 "}]
