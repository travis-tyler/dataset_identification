Future work to validate the classification maps is needed. The third component is to demonstrate how GIS could support marine resources management in Phu Quoc. Coral reefs are susceptible to nutrient excess and sedimentation caused by run-off water. A GIS-based model was developed to assess the environmental sensitivity of coastal watersheds impacting the nearby coral reefs via the sedimentation process. The model incorporates vegetation cover, terrain steepness, and watershed area, and takes into account the proximity of benthic habitats and estuarine areas. Vegetation cover was extracted from the TM 1992 image. Slope and area by watershed were extracted from the 1969 topographic map. The resulting sensitivity maps could assist coastal managers in making informed decisions on landuse activities to ensure the viability of the nearby coral reefs."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "I am indebted to many for helping me through my Master's program.

They give food, shelter and protection to a large number of marine species. Coral reefs and the nearby areas provide food for subsistence fishing by local communities. They provide shoreline protection against wave action and recreational opportunities. With their great beauty and aesthetic value, coral reefs are becoming a major attraction for tourism. In addition, the genetic diversity on coral reefs may have great potential for new pharmaceuticals (Birkeland, 1997). Coral reefs also provide many \"intangible\" benefits. Because corals remove large amounts of CO from the oceans during calcification, the reefs play a role in the global CO 2 budget (Lalli & Parsons 1997). Their annual deposition of calcium carbonate is extremely high; it accounts for the removal of approximately 50% of the total calcium annually brought to the oceans by rivers (Smith, 1978). The South An Thoi Islands have been one of seven critical sites proposed as marine protected areas in Vietnam (Vo et al. 1995). -Sea grass habitats Sea grass beds are important feeding and breeding habitats for many marine species, including endangered species like the Green sea turtle and sea cow. They function as a nursery area for aquatic animals, including many commercially caught fish species, and as a buffer to protect the shoreline from erosion and to trap sediments. The water east of Phu Quoc Islands is an important crab spawning ground (WWF Vietnam Marine Conservation Southern Survey Team 1994). Off the coast of Ham Ninh, sea grass beds at three to seven meter depth is a major commercial catch area for the Blue Swimmer Crab (Portunus pelagicus) during the south-west monsoon (Nguyen, 1993)."}, {"section_title": "Current crucial pressures on Phu Quoc's marine resources", "text": "Like many other places in Vietnam, these islands are experiencing a strong demand for development. Major threats to marine wildlife in Phu Quoc include: -At present, the increase in fishing pressure in the coastal waters is a major problem in Phu Quoc, since the island's population (Table 1) and commercial fishing fleets are growing rapidly ( Figure 2). Signs of over-exploitation were already showing in both finfish fisheries and special products, such as pearl oysters and sea cucumbers (WWF Vietnam Marine Conservation Southern Survey Team 1994). Contrary to an increase in total vessel power, there is evidence of a decline in the catch per unit effort (CPUE) between 1989 and 1993. This lower CPUE was stable throughout 1993 -1997. In addition, the increasing and uncontrolled exploitation by artisanal fishermen in the shallow waters including coral reef areas is another threat to the sustainable fisheries of Phu Quoc (Nguyen, 1993).

Satellite imagery generally has greater spectral resolution than aerial photography, in a trade-off for lower spatial resolution (C-CAP 1999). In some areas where locals can not afford the high cost of aerial photography, satellite imagery can be a valuable alternative source to assess benthic habitats. Landsat imagery can be traced back to July 1972. At present, aerial photography is qualitatively and spatially more reliable for benthic mapping and monitoring than satellite based methods. Thus, aerial photography is the imagery of choice for comprehensive benthic mapping and change detection the NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) (C-CAP 1999). Another advantage of airborne remote sensing systems is that the timing of data acquisition can be arranged to coincide with low tide, when the signal from benthic features is strongest, and calm sea conditions. Benthic habitats of the Florida Keys were mapped from a series of 450 aerial photographs (NOS 1998). The boundaries of specific habitat types were outlined by interpreting color patterns on the photographs. Benthic habitats were classified into four major categories -corals, seagrasses, hardbottom, and bare substrate -and 24 sub-categories, such as sparse seagrass and patch reef. Also, some success has been reported using satellite imagery to monitor submersed habitats. Landsat and SPOT data have been successfully used to inventory macroalgae such as the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, along southern California shorelines (Jensen et al. 1980;Augenstein et al. 1991). In clear shallow tropical waters with a highly reflective substrate, Landsat imagery may discriminate sand from coral reef or seagrass (Luczkovich et al. 1993) or provide an estimate of biomass for unispecific beds of Thalassia testudinum (Armstrong 1993). In the turbid estuaries of the eastern United States, Landsat and SPOT imagery can be used to detect some (e.g. large, dense, shallow) but not all of the submersed rooted vascular plants which are visible in the best aerial photography (C-CAP 1999). New airborne multi/hyperspectral sensors have the advantage of both high spectral and spatial resolution. The digital airborne sensor CASI (Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager) offers up to 16 user-specified spectral bands within the blue to near infrared portion (400-1000nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum and a spatial resolution of 0.5-10 m to distinguish benthic habitats.

With differential correction, single position fixes with GPS are accurate to a circular error of less than one meter (C-CAP 1999). A number of other technologies can provide valuable supplemental data to aerial photographic detection of benthic habitats (C-CAP 1999).

There are several ways to discriminate the water-land interface. Basically, they all relied on the distinctive characteristic that water is a much better absorber than most features on land in near-infrared (IR) and thermal wavelengths. A combination of TM reflected infrared (IR) bands 4, 5, 7 or ratios between the thermal and visible bands can distinguish land from water. For instance, the ratio of TM bands 2 and 5 is useful for identifying all water bodies and provides subtle wetland information (Jensen, 1986). In this study, I used the near infrared band to help discriminate water from land with a threshold set to 37 (Figure ). Since the recorded signal from cloud areas contains little or no information about features covered beneath, it is necessary to remove these areas from the image. The cloudy areas in the study area were carefully studied in all TM bands, especially the thermal-IR band.

Phu Quoc water clarity is low due to high total suspended solids (TSS) mainly made up of shells and planktonic debris (WWF Vietnam Marine Conservation Southern Survey Team, 1994). To increase the possibility that Landsat TM data contain useful information about the bottom, the study area was restricted to shallow water with depth less than 6 meters. Due to the small size of the study area, atmospheric conditions were assumed spatially homogeneous over the area during the Landsat satellite overpass. To minimize the heterogeneity of water masses in the study area, the study area was geographically stratified into subsets based on water clarity, facing aspect, wave activity; and classified separately for each subset. It is expected that the composition of water remains the same everywhere in each sub-divided area, and thus water optical properties were assumed to be spatially and vertically constant in each sub-area. Three sites with available pre-knowledge of benthic habitats were selected (Table 4 and Figure 6). valleys, plains, lakes, rivers, and vegetation) and cultural features (e.g. roads, transmission lines and major buildings). Detecting submerged features, however, has been especially difficult. We must look through one more medium -the overlying water -to see the sea bottom. The reflectance of shallow water areas to solar illumination is a function of the water depth, the water optical properties and the bottom reflectance (Lyzenga, 1981). The effect of water depth variation on the reflectance from the sea bottom could causes spectral similarity between some of the submerged habitats and, in particular, between seagrass and deep water, and between seagrass, coral and algae (Zainal et al., 1993). Water effectively attenuates the spectral response of submerged features. Different wavelengths get attenuated differently. The highly reflective signal above 700nm cannot be used in remote sensing studies of benthic habitats due to the extreme attenuation of near infrared (NIR) wavelengths by water (Armstrong 1993). Infrared radiation is totally absorbed by approximately 2 m of clear water, while visible radiation in the blue-green region can penetrate as much as 25 m (Sanchez et al. 1999). In this study, three TM visible bands (i.e. band 1, 2, 3) were used and the study areas were restricted to areas with water depth shallower than 6 meters. Algorithm to minimize water-depth dependent radiation (Lygenza 1978, Lygenza 1981, Spitzer et al 1987, Armstrong 1993 The algorithm described by Lyzenga (1978) to extract bottom-type information depends upon the fact that the bottom-reflected radiance is approximately a linear function of bottom reflectance and an exponential function of the water depth. The TM visible bands were processed by linearizing the exponential depth dependence of the signal received by the satellite sensor (Armstrong 1993). Lyzenga (1978) used the transformation where Li is the signal for each pixel in band i ,and Li-is the deep water signal. The deep water signal was computed from an 50 by 50 pixel window over the water south of Trang Island that has depths deeper than 40 meters. Two standard deviations were subtracted from the mean value to minimize instrument and environmental noise (Armstrong 1993). Analogous to Lyzenga (1981) and Spitzer and Dirks (1987), Armstrong (1993) used a linear combination of the logtransformed variables to produce three depth-invariant bands of the form where KilKi is the ratio of the attenuation coefficients for bands i and j. This ratio was obtained directly from the Landsat TM data by selecting areas of uniform bottom composition, but variable depth, using the methodology described by Lyzenga (1981)."}, {"section_title": "Benthic habitat classification", "text": "For each of the three test sites, classifications were performed on the newly transformed TM visible bands as well as on the original ones (i.e. without depth-variance effect correction). These were done using the unsupervised classification routine in the ERDAS IMAGINE package that is based on the ISODATA algorithm. (ISODATA stands for \"Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique\"). The ISODATA clustering method uses the minimum spectral distance formula to form clusters (Schrader et al. 1997). Similar pixel values in three visible bands will be sorted into a pre-defined number of clusters. All input parameters were declared the same for the image with and without depth-effect correction: 12 clusters, maximum iterations of 25, convergence threshold of 99%. These clusters then were manually grouped into meaningful classes based on field data at hand, pre-knowledge, and reference to ancillary data from the topographic map.\nThese were multiplied by a constant to place the algorithm within an appropriate range for display (stretching the range of the depth-invariant indexes) (Armstrong 1993). Employing the same classification procedure (number of clusters, convergence threshold), classifications with depth-effect correction generally tend to lump pixels into fewer classes than classifications without depth-variation-effect correction. The algorithm was probably capable of minimizing depth-dependent variance.

Thalassia hemprichii and Cymodocea rotundata are the key species that form a complex shallow water marine community including algae, invertebrates, and fish that utilize the grasses for shelter and food (Nguyen, 1993). Figure 22 presents the predicted maps of seagrass distribution along the Ham Ninh shore with and without depth-variation-effect correction, and the spectral signatures of each classified class. The darker area (lower value in both transformed and original visible bands) along the shore potentially corresponds to the extensive seagrass beds reported from the 1993 field survey (Nguyen 1993). In contrast to exposed sand bottom, seagrass bed is darker in color because of its lower reflectance. According to the predicted map with depth-variation-effect correction, the seagrass beds (purple-coded band) distributed along the shore extend off shore a couple hundred meters to about one kilometer."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The predicted maps of benthic habitats are gridded data at a spatial resolution of 30 meters, and an apparent spatial displacement of 60 meters. The maps could serve as a good reference source in future studies of Phu Quoc coastal ecosystems. A validation test, however, should be carried out to evaluate the results from these maps. A set of ground check locations would be randomly generated and located during field visits with a notebook GPS to record benthic types for evaluation of these predicted maps. Since the TM image was taken in 1992, future validation assessment relies on an acceptable assumption that these benthic habitats have not dramatically changed during this short time period (some ten years). Evaluators should also consider the likely seasonal variation of the submersed vegatation. Future study of the optical properties of Phu Quoc water is needed for benthic habitat mapping using optical data like Landsat data, especially the change of optical properties of in-shore water caused by \"island effect\", tide, and monsoon regime (wind and rain factors). Designed for landuse and landcover mapping, the application of Landsat TM data in benthic marine environment poses a limitation in shallow and clear water. The 30-meter spatial resolution of Landsat TM data woud be more relevant for mapping shallow benthic habitats of large extent such as Ham Ninh seagrass beds or coral reefs in the Spratlys. Using Landsat data available back to 1972, and the Lyzenga method could provide a mean to detect changes of benthic habitats over time, especially in the past, when we could not go back to collect data and do in-situ measurements."}, {"section_title": "Topographical effect normalization and classification for land area", "text": "In an image classified without topographic effect normalization, the forested areas shaded by the hills can be mistaken for the very wet soils that have similar reflectance.

Coral reef communities are highly adapted to nutrient-deficient, oligotrophic and clear water conditions. They often depend upon other ecosystems such as coastal forest, mangrove wetlands and sea-grass beds, which normally act as filters for sediment run-off from land. Sediments and accompanying nutrients are usually considered the greatest threat to coral reefs (Birkeland, 1997). The suspended silt decreases light penetration, thus reducing photosynthesis of the zooxanthellae and diminishing the principle nutritional source for the corals. Although coral polyps are capable of removing some settling sediment, using mucus trapping and cilia to clean their surfaces, excessive quantities of silt will clog this apparatus and smother the polyps (Lalli & Parsons, 1997). The development in Phu Quoc Island coupled with an increasing population means more land clearance for construction and agricultural landuse. This will potentially lead to increased runoff and excessive sedimentation, and subsequently end up on coastal water where fringing coral reefs scattered along the coastline. Erosion, sediment transport and deposition involves complex interactions between rainfall, surface and subsurface hydrology, soil properties, land cover and topography (Mitasova, et al. 1998).  "}, {"section_title": "Create sensitivity layer", "text": "The thematic maps produced from the DEM and the TM image were converted from raster to vector format for import into the GIS model ( Figure 7). Vegetation cover was next combined with slope data, then intersected by watersheds to produce a resulting polygon coverage that contains slope and vegetation information. This information is used in to rank the area's susceptibility to erosion based on the criteria function in Table 7. The susceptibility ranges from level 1 to 6, where an area of class 6 is the most vulnerable to erosion and characterized by novegetation cover on a steep slope. Fortunately, Phu Quoc Island still houses a healthy forest cover of about 70%, especially in the North part of the island that has hilly terrain and steeper slopes. There were very few areas in sensitivity class 6 (coded in red color) ( Figure 25). The size of a catchment area is a major factor in determining the runoff volume, and GIS provides such data (Table 8 in Appendix C presents area and perimeter by watershed). Corals are vulnerable to freshwater runoff and sedimentation. In contrast to adult fish that can escape from temporary and localized environmental stresses by swimming away, the fact that corals are stationary species makes coral more vulnerable to the stresses. In terms of run-off water quantity (i.e. freshwater discharged volume), the watershed with a larger area is more significant in contributing larger amounts of fresh water to the coastal region and extending the reach radius of fresh water from its river mouth. Located in a geographic area where hazards like monsoon rains or exceptional ones like typhoons are common (heavy rainfall over short periods of time), land clearance taking place in these watersheds exacerbates the run-off effect, greatly increasing the amount of sediment that could reach nearby coral reefs. Non-regularly increased sediment concentration and volume of fresh water run-off may break down the long-term ecological balance of co-existence between estuarine areas and their neighboring coral reefs. In terms of run-off water quality (turbidity or sediment content), a steeper slope results in greater energy of water flow, therefore posing a greater potential for erosion.

It can support many activities including fisheries management, coastal zone management, hazard mitigation (e.g. erosion), and research into the region's marine resources. GIS as an aid to future research -The 30-meter Phu Quoc DEM, a product created from the topographic map, could be used in remote sensing studies to normalize topography effects, and in hydrologic studies. Normally, watersheds created from DEMs are the primary input to surface hydrologic models, which are used to determine the height, timing, and inundation of a flood, locate areas contributing -pollutants to a stream, or predict the effects of altering the landscape (ESRI). The DEM also enhances visualization of geographic data (Figure 27). The ecological roles of sea grass and coral reefs habitats in the productive water of Phu Quoc remain unknown. They likely serve as critical areas for the key commercial fishery species such as breeding or feeding grounds. An integrated understanding of these areas is necessary for sound fishery management, and to insure the integrity of this productive marine ecosysytem. A GIS is helpful in investigating these critical areas and in delineating major fishing grounds, because of its ability to integrate data from different sources, as well as update, manipulate, and exploit data.

The capability of GIS data to be updated over time facilitates the integration of results from research in different disciplines in a more interpretable manner. Eventually, these end products will be of considerable use to resource managers. Over-fishing in the near-shore waters of Phu Quoc where coral reefs and sea grass beds are located, especially artisanal fishing, is a primary concern to the sustainable management of coastal resources in Phu Quoc. There is the need to establish a marine reserve to protect these critical benthic habitats which help maintain the fishery resources in the area. Marine protected areas (no-fishing zones or restricted fishing areas) are seen as useful fisheries management tools. A GIS with a set of thematic maps and relevant attribute data could offer a comprehensive way to do site selection for conservation and spatial planning for the protected areas. Coastal resource managers can use maps of areas susceptible to inundation under sea-level rise scenarios to plan accordingly for their long-term development activities. The DEM could help locate these susceptible areas. Satellite data, aerial photography and other geographical data can be brought together in the GIS and exploited for specific purposes. Land cover and change analysis data can be interpreted, categorized, and integrated with other spatial data in a GIS for use by coastal resource managers. The ability to visualize problems through the medium of GIS databases is a useful tool for focusing attention and generating ideas (Carver et al. 1996). Moreover, with the aid of a GIS, coastal resource managers can look for correlation or changes in coastal habitats (resources distribution, abundance, and ecosystem health).

Reflectance of both is high in the TM visible bands, in comparison to the open sea. However, this is not the case in thermal-IR band 6, where clouds appear darker and stand out from cloud-free water. Thorough examination and classification of the TM image based on a combination of all bands, such as PCA, could successfully identify clouds over the study area. TM imagery is useful for identifying the seagrass beds in Ham Ninh and fringing reefs in South An Thoi, using TM visible bands and restricting water depths to less than 6 meters. However, validation is needed to evaluate the accuracy of the benthic habitat maps. TM data can be helpful for mapping other coral reef areas in Vietnam, especially for the more extensive reefs at areas such as Spratly Islands. Increasing fishing pressure in near-shore Phu Quoc, where coral reefs and sea grass are located, is a primary concern to the sustainable management of coastal resources in Phu Quoc. There is the need to establish a marine sanctuary to protect these critical benthic habitats and insure the integrity of the marine ecosystem.
