[{"section_title": "", "text": "What percentage of public school teachers earn income from working outside their school system, and how does this vary by region? Regular, full-time public school teachers were asked whether they earned additional compensation, beyond their base teaching salary, for working a job outside their school system. Overall, 18 percent of teachers had a job outside their school system. Teachers categorized these jobs as teaching or tutoring (5 percent), non-teaching, but related to the teaching field (4 percent), or in another field (9 percent) (figure 1). A higher percentage of teachers in schools in the Northeast and Midwest (both 19 percent) worked in a job outside their school system than teachers in schools in the South and West (both 17 percent). A higher percentage of teachers in schools in the Northeast (5 percent) supplemented their income through teaching or tutoring than teachers in schools in the Midwest (4 percent). A higher percentage of teachers in schools in the Northeast and Midwest (both 4 percent) supplemented their income through activities in a non-teaching, but related field than teachers in the South (3 percent). A higher percentage of teachers in the Midwest (11 percent) supplemented their income by working in another field than teachers in the Northeast, South, and West (9, 10, and 8 percent, respectively).
