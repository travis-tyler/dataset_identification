[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Objective: Hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-Aging) is a common cause of dementia in older adults. We tested the variability in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins associated with previously identified HS-Aging risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Methods: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort (ADNI; n = 237) data, combining both multiplexed proteomics CSF and genotype data, were used to assess the association between CSF analytes and risk SNPs in four genes (SNPs): GRN (rs5848), TMEM106B (rs1990622), ABCC9 (rs704180), and KCNMB2 (rs9637454). For controls, non-HS-Aging SNPs in APOE (rs429358/rs7412) and MAPT (rs8070723) were also analyzed against A\u03b21-42 and total tau CSF analytes. Results: The GRN risk SNP (rs5848) status correlated with variation in CSF proteins, with the risk allele (T) associated with increased levels of AXL Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (AXL), TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand Receptor 3 (TRAIL-R3), Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and clusterin (CLU) (all p b 0.05 after Bonferroni correction). The TRAIL-R3 correlation was significant in meta-analysis with an additional dataset (p = 5.05 \u00d7 10\n). Further, the rs5848 SNP status was associated with increased CSF tau protein -a marker of neurodegeneration (p = 0.015). These data are remarkable since this GRN SNP has been found to be a risk factor for multiple types of dementia-related brain pathologies."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Studies of CSF analytes may provide biomarkers for dementia subtyping and also may provide clues about brain disease pathogenesis. These biomarker studies are all the more important as there are clearly many diseases in addition to Alzheimer's disease (AD) that underlie the clinical syndrome of dementia. Presently, individual AD \"mimics\" are challenging in any given patient to rule in or out. Clinical studies using neuroimaging and CSF analyses have identified a subset of individuals with evidence of neurodegeneration but lacking features of AD-type amyloidogenesis according to neuroimaging or biofluid studies. These cases have been termed \"SNAP\" (suspected non-amyloid pathology) and this biomarker profile has been observed in approximately 1/4th of cognitively impaired individuals (Jack et al., 2016) Hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-Aging) is among the most common of the AD mimics (Nelson et al., 2013; Zarow et al., 2012) , and prior studies emphasize the public health impact of this high-morbidity SNAP-type brain condition. HS-Aging is diagnosed at autopsy when neuron loss and astrocytosis are observed in the hippocampal formation, out of proportion to AD-type plaques and tangles (Amador-Ortiz et al., 2007a; Montine et al., 2012; Nelson et al., 2013) . Unlike other diseases that share the diagnostic label of \"hippocampal sclerosis\", HSAging is distinguished clinically by the advanced age of the individuals afflicted, and by the usual lack of either seizure disorder or frontotemporal dementia symptoms clinically (Amador-Ortiz et al., 2007b; Lee et al., 2008; Nelson et al., 2011; Wilson et al., 2013) . Further, HS-Aging has a pathological biomarker: TDP-43 pathology Experimental Gerontology 90 (2017) "}, {"section_title": "Contents lists available at ScienceDirect", "text": "Experimental Gerontology j o u r n a l h o m e p a g e : w w w . e l s e v i e r . c o m / l o c a t e / e x p g e r o (Amador-Ortiz et al., 2007b; Neumann et al., 2006) . HS-Aging affects up to 25% of the \"oldest-old\" (Leverenz et al., 2002; Nelson et al., 2011; Nelson et al., 2013; Zarow et al., 2012) and is associated with substantial disease-specific cognitive impairment (Brenowitz et al., 2014 , Nelson et al., 2010 . Even at state-of-the-art research institutions, HS-Aging tends to be misdiagnosed as AD clinically because of overlapping symptoms (Brenowitz et al., 2014 , Nelson et al., 2011 , Pao et al., 2011 .\nGenetic risk factors for HS-Aging have recently been characterized, comprising four specific gene variants that are the focus of the present study. The genes that harbor these risk-associated variants are: GRN, TMEM106B, ABCC9, and KCNMB2. The goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the specific gene variants associated with HSAging pathology also are associated with variation in the biochemical composition of CSF.\nIn terms of the specific risk alleles, gene-focused studies found that SNPs were associated with HS-Aging that previously had been linked to frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP), namely rs5848 (GRN) and rs1990622 (near TMEM106B) (Dickson et al., 2010 , Murray et al., 2014 , Rutherford et al., 2012 , Van Langenhove et al., 2012 . The GRN SNP was subsequently linked to other dementia-inducing disorders (Chang et al., 2013; Galimberti et al., 2012; Kamalainen et al., 2013; Pickering-Brown et al., 2008; Rademakers et al., 2008) . Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using large datasets have implicated two genes that encode potassium channel regulators -ABCC9 (rs704180) and KCNMB2 (rs9637454) -in HS-Aging pathology (Beecham et al., 2014; Nelson et al., 2014) . Collectively these prior studies indicate that non-AD genes may have a strong impact on elderly individuals' brain structure and function, but much remains to be learned about these genes' roles in health and disease states. In contrast to AD, APOE gene variants are not associated with altered risk for HS-Aging (Brenowitz et al., 2014 , Leverenz et al., 2002 , Nelson et al., 2011 , Pao et al., 2011 , Troncoso et al., 1996 , indicating that HS-Aging is a separate disease entity from AD.\nThe goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis that variability in CSF analytes is associated with HS-Aging risk alleles in a population of older adults, many of whom are cognitively impaired. This study analyzed data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort and the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) at Washington University Cohort. The CSF came from lumbar punctures in patients spanning the clinical spectrum from normal to demented subjects (see Ayton et al., 2015 , Kang et al., 2015 , and the average age of the research subjects when the samples were obtained was approximately 75 years.

The analysis was done with and without covariate adjustment as sensitivity analysis for potential confounding. In additional to these primary analyses, the positive controls of APOE-\u03b54 with A\u03b21-42 and MAPT haplotypes with total tau were also analyzed similarly. Although a log transformation had already been made in the primary CSF data, any remaining violations of the normal distributional assumption (per a Shapiro-Wilks test for non-normality) were adjusted with a Box-Cox transformation.\nSince 83 individual CSF analytes were tested for association with each of the four HS-Aging risk SNPs, we used a Bonferroni correction and considered any result significant when p b 1.5 \u00d7 10 \u2212 4 (= 0.05 / (83 * 4)).

The only HS-Aging gene to reach statistical significance with any CSF analyte after multiple testing adjustment was GRN (rs5848_T), which revealed four study-wide significant correlations.

For example, an additional copy of the rs5848 T allele confers an estimated N 2-fold increase (2.02 = e 0.704 ) of AXL after adjustment for gender, diagnosis, age at lumbar puncture and the first three principal components. The distributions of AXL measures by rs5848 genotype and diagnosis are shown in Fig. 2A , displaying the pattern of increased protein for each T allele.

We show the residuals from a regression of log(tau) on A\u03b21-42 and the adjustment covariates (Fig. 3A) and the unadjusted log(tau) values (Fig. 3B) against GRN genotype."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We here report that the GRN risk SNP (rs5848) was associated with variation in detected levels of CSF proteins previously implicated in CNS inflammation in the ADNI data set (Aktas et al., 2007) . The same GRN risk allele was also associated with increased CSF tau which may indicate directly related neurodegenerative changes. We found no direct evidence that other putative HS-Aging risk variants are associated with variation in CSF proteins in these samples.\nAn important caveat in interpreting our results is the limited sample size (n = 237 patients included) given the number of variables (83 analytes) being assessed. This sample size confers 80% power to detect an additive CSF analyte effect of 1.21 standard deviations with a nominal 5% level of significance, when adjusting for the 4 * 83 = 332 hypothesis tests. Among the additional sources of variability is the fact that the research subjects span a broad spectrum of clinical states from \"normal\" to \"dementia\", which in itself probably introduces substantial variability related to patient activity, medication, diet, and other factors. There may be additional sources of variation due to possible preanalytical variables since the samples were collected from dozens of different clinical locations (see Materials And methods). Moreover, the non-A\u03b2 (i.e., non-AD) pathogenetic elements in large autopsy series include \u03b1-synucleinopathy and primary age-related tauopathy (PART) which add to the phenotypic complexity (see for example Neltner et al. (2016) ). These factors argue for caution in interpreting our data and heighten the likelihood of false-negative results; the study design is best tailored for high effect-size phenomena. Further, the CSF samples were obtained from relatively young individuals considering the age range of vulnerability to HS-Aging (Nelson et al., 2013) . Another caveat relates to the basic characteristic of the ADNI cohort which is enriched for persons with AD risk per se. Multiple studies have found that HSAging tends to misdiagnosed as AD in the clinical setting (Brenowitz et al., 2014 , Pao et al., 2011 . However, we also note that the ADNI data set has been used productively by many other researchers to test hypotheses related to potential dementia biomarkers.\nAs far as we know this is the first study of CSF analytes in relation to HS-Aging genetic risk factors. The first gene variant to be linked to HSAging pathology, rs5848 (Rademakers et al., 2008) is physically located in the 3\u2032 untranslated region of the GRN mRNA. The risk allele is associated with decreased plasma expression of GRN/PGRN (Dickson et al., 2010 , Fenoglio et al., 2009 .\nOur results can be interpreted from different perspectives, reflecting how much is currently unknown. Whereas multiple GRN mutations cause , rs5848 is apparently a disease-modifying allele that alters the manifestation of multiple different diseases rather than affecting FTLD or HS-Aging specifically. For example, rs5848 has been linked to AD, Parkinson's disease, C9ORF72 neurodegeneration, and bipolar disorder (Chang et al., 2013 , Galimberti et al., 2012 , Kamalainen et al., 2013 , Pickering-Brown et al., 2008 , Rademakers et al., 2008 , van Blitterswijk et al., 2014 . Moreover, the SNAP profile -biomarker indication of a neurodegenerative process despite lack of A\u03b2-type amyloidogenesis -is linked to multiple different brain conditions. Hypothetically, one could have \"neurodegeneration\" in the CNS without tau protein in the CSF, especially in a disease like HS-Aging where the cell loss may occur without substantial tauopathy. The present study for the first time ties rs5848 related brain changes with increased CSF analytes in addition to CSF tau, indicating that neurodegeneration linked to TDP-43 pathology (the most specific pathological marker of HS-Aging) leads to increased CSF tau that can be detected in a complex background. A prior study reported that rs5848 status and PGRN levels in CSF were linked to CSF tau variance (Morenas-Rodriguez et al., 2015) , whereas another study found that GRN mutant FTLD cases lacked increased tau in CSF (Carecchio et al., 2011) .\nAlso interesting is the subset of CSF analytes that were found to be altered in association with rs5848 genotypes; these include AXL, TRAIL-R3, VCAM-1 and CLU. Each of these gene products has been the subject of extensive research, and collectively the prior studies appear to point towards a common theme that also is relevant to GRN itself. GRN has been implicated in microglial function and neuroinflammation (Cenik et al., 2012; Jian et al., 2013) , and each of the above mentioned protein products also can be linked to neuroinflammatory pathways. For example, CLU (clusterin, also known as apolipoprotein J) has been described to play a role in microglial activation and A\u03b2 uptake (Mulder et al., 2014; Xie et al., 2005) . Since GRN is a risk factor for FTLD-TDP, with extensive TDP-43 pathology, as well as HS-Aging, which seems to be a different disease, it is possible that the GRN/ PGRN protein and neuroinflammation play a contributory role in TDP-43 pathology per se. However, more work is required to test this hypothesis. Whether the analytes themselves are pathogenetic agents is another important question that remains to be answered.\nWe conclude that among subjects with CSF analyte and genotype data available in the ADNI cohort, the HS-Aging risk gene variants are mostly not found to be associated with CSF protein changes. However, the GRN risk SNP rs5848 shows some analyte variation that indicate high effect sizes, perhaps linked to neuroinflammatory phenotype. We now know that dementia has many causes and multiple pathologic comorbodities often are simultaneously expressed in elderly individuals. Future studies may elucidate other links between non-AD risk alleles and biomarkers to enable better diagnoses and to thus strengthen our ability to develop and test future therapeutic strategies.\nthe National Cell Repository for AD (NCRAD), which receives government support under a cooperative agreement grant (U24 AG21886) awarded by the National Institute on Aging (AIG), were used in this study."}]
