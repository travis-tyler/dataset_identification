[{"section_title": "I. Introduction", "text": "In July 2009, Connecticut Public Act 09-229 established an agricultural sustainability account to provide financial assistance to Connecticut milk producers during times when the federal milk pay price falls below a minimum sustainable monthly cost of production (COP). This legislation mandates that the Commissioner of Agriculture make payments to Connecticut dairy farmers on a quarterly basis. To determine whether payments are necessary to comply with the legislation, Public Act 09-229 defines the minimum sustainable monthly COP as eighty-two percent of the monthly average COP for a New England state, as calculated by the Economic Research Service (ERS) of the United States Department of Agriculture. To comply with state legislation, the Commissioner of Agriculture has requested that The Zwick Center for Food and Resource Policy in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of Connecticut provide estimates of the monthly COP for a New England State based on data and variables published by the USDA. Since the PA 09-229, Vermont's milk COP has served as the benchmark for Connecticut's milk COP. This report is a follow up on previous reports for 2011 quarters two and three that use the current USDA methodology and continues the Vermont and Maine milk COP estimates previously calculated by the USDA's ERS. 1 This report presents milk COP estimates and prices for quarter four of 2011."}, {"section_title": "II. New USDA Survey Data Availability: The 2010 ARMS", "text": "The methodology used to estimate the milk COP for application of Public Act 09-229 relies upon the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) to provide an annual milk COP for Vermont and Maine. This survey, updated every five years by the USDA, is used as a benchmark to estimate monthly and annual changes using National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) indices. Previous 2011 COP estimates generated used the 2005 ARMS data as a benchmark because the 2010 ARMS data had not been released. This changed on January 30, 2012, when the ERS released the 2010 annual state level milk cost of production using the 2010 ARMS as the base year for 23 states, including only Vermont and Maine in New England. The 2010 ARMS estimates the annual milk COP for Vermont at $28.99/cwt. This is $6.22/cwt higher than the 2010 annual estimate for Vermont based on the 2005 ARMS. The major contributing factors in this increased cost of production for 2010 are total feed costs that increased $3.68/cwt, opportunity cost of unpaid labor that increased $1.23, and the capital recovery of machinery and equipment that increased $1.28/cwt. Changes to the Maine COP estimate is not as large. The 2010 ARMS estimate is $33.22/cwt, which represents only a $1.73/cwt increase from the 2010 estimate based on the 2005 ARMS. We use the updated 2010 ARMS data to estimate the monthly COP for quarter four of 2011 for both states. The release of updated data and the significant changes that occurred from the 2005 to 2010 ARMS, for two states in New England that likely have significantly different cost structures, underscores the importance of developing a Connecticut specific benchmark for milk COP. The 2010 ARMS estimate for Vermont increased by 27.3%, for Maine increased only 5.5%, and for New York decreased by 0.2% from one survey year to the next. This highlights why a Connecticut specific COP is the best practice method for continued implementation of the law, as recommended in a COP Dairy Summit hosted by the Zwick Center in November 2011, with Agriculture Commissioners from Connecticut and Massachusetts, dairy farmers from both states, COP experts, and other stakeholders."}, {"section_title": "III. Monthly Cost of Production and Related Uniform Pricing for Quarter 4, 2011", "text": "The estimates for the October, November, and December 2011 milk COP for Vermont and Maine are shown in Table 1. Total operating costs in Vermont for October, November, and December 2011 are $21.09, $20.81, and $20.46/cwt., respectively. The major component of operating costs is the total feed costs of $16.12, $15.80, and $15.59/cwt., respectively. With the exception of the feed cost categories, there is very little variation within cost categories from month to month. Including total allocated overhead, the total milk COP in Vermont is estimated at $33.84 for October, $33.59 for November, and $32.98/cwt. for December, with an average COP for quarter four estimated at $33.47/cwt. The total milk COP in Maine is estimated at $37.81 for October, $36.41 for November, and $37.70/cwt. for December, with an average milk COP for quarter four estimated at $37.31/cwt.  Business Summary and Analysis model (the Cornell model) which is the gold standard and has been used elsewhere for more than 50 years without any problems (please note that current users include Maine, New York and Pennsylvania). Aside from Vermont and Maine having quite different cost structures than those faced by Connecticut dairy farmers, continued reliance on the USDA will continue to make the Connecticut program hostage to changes in methodology, relying on outdated benchmark information, or suspended reporting, as we experienced in the past year. Although the initial year will be demanding, as all initial investments are, migrating to Connecticut numbers will be a worthwhile endeavor by applying the best practices to policy decisions and farm management."}]
