[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The aim of the study was to examine causes of low achievement among Jordanian 8 th grade students in TIMSS study-2015 from science teachers and educational supervisor. Another objective of the study was to examine the role of position (teacher, supervisor), gender, experience, educational directorate on their perceptions. To achieve this aim, a (51) items questionnaire was administrated to the science male and female teacher whose schools have reported under average level in TIMSS study-2015; totaling (100) teachers and (114) educational supervisors. The results of the study showed that causes of lower achievement among Jordanian 8 th grade students were at high levels from science teachers and educational supervisors perceptions as school administration related causes ranked first. The results found no statistically significant differences due to gender in causes for low achievement in TIMSS, while differences were found in school administration related causes due to educational directorate, in favor of middle region, due to experience, in favor of (6-10) years of experience. In light of results, the study recommended the need for organizing conferences with ministry of education officials and science teachers to discuss the how to overcome the causes behind low achievement level in TIMSS study. Finally, future research is needed to compare the results reported in high achievement countries in TIMSS study with the ones reported in Jordan."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The purpose of Knowledge economy is the taking of the educational institutions the lead among the other societal ones, in a wey that thoughts and knowledge become a core for communities. In this regard, schools are considered the starting point for these thanghts and the main source for human capital (Al -Hashimi and Al -Arazwi, 2007) . This is achieved with the emphasis's, of lump with its components: aims, content, teaching methods and assessment, with the building of the learner's knowledge by themselves in order to increase their creative ability, and problem solving in the frame of instructional process which a supportive management to create new contexts and situations to support learners experiences and equip them with knowledge, values and attitudes which make them scientifically educated people (AlNashif, 2009 ), Instructional curricula represent a vital component on the top of the instructional process, through which the purposes and aspirations of society are achieved. Curriculum in the modern concept is an integrative system with its structure, components represented in its philosophy, aims, content, experiences, teaching methods, assessment measures and feedback for its improvement or development (Ali, 2010) .\nAs each branch of knowledge has its special nature which distinguishes it from other branches, science curricula should reflect the components mature of science and its social function; otherwise, learners would come out from their instructional experience in a deformed incomplete picture about it (Attallah, 2010) . The document of the broad guidelines of the science curricula of the basic education stage; issued by the courcil of education, contained a group of purposes, on the top of which is the acquisition of scientific facts and concepts in a functional way, in order to make the study of science a mean for under, standing the environment in a way which goes with the newest innovations of science (Ministry of Education 2017) http://www.moe.gove.jo.\nSchool textbook is the instrument through which purposes and aspirations are achieved through arousing the learners' interest and forming their motive toward the teaching content in a way that ensures the continuity of their positive interaction with the experiences provided within it and from without (Topcu, Erbilgin and Arkan, 2016) . and augmentation of their communities, besides the fact that teachers are the most informed about the problems which face students when building up concepts, knowledge and skills, the employment of competent teachers is a precondition for the improvement of the educational system (Benner and Mistry, 2007) .\nThe process of improving and developing study curricula in the first place aims at furthering the curriculum in achieving the purposes of the educational system seeking to achieve comprehensive development. This cannot be accomplished without the assessment and evaluation of curricula. Assessment should include the four elements of curriculum, as well as the identification of the cores, without which curriculum cannot succeed, namely, the teacher, school management and the student (Ali, 2011; Saadah and Ibraheem, 2016) .\nThe assessment process of any educational program implies the taking of decisions that divectly or indirectly influence the teaching process. The decision could be the continuity of the present curriculum, or modification or elimination when it is unable to achieve what it was meant for. And as the exact decision depends on the exact information, obtaining true information forms the corner stone in the assessment process which derives its importance from the importance of the role it plays in the guidance of the educational process (Al -Fumadi and Al -Zarabee, 2004) .\nAs a result of the concern of the educational system in Jordan about precise information and data concerning the educational situation in public and private schools, there has been a kind of co-operation with international organizations in order to develop education like the American Agency for Development, UNISCO and UNICEF. This comperation was put in effect through the participation of Jordan in the international studies (PISA, TIMSS) whose results reflect the competency and efficiency of educational curricula through the assessment of educational quality in comparison with other participating countries (Trends in International mathematics and science study). The international study of science and mathematics is an instrument of international tests for the assessment of students achievement in science and mathematics and an evaluation of the efficiency of teaching these two subjects in the schools of participating countries at the world level. This study is conducted by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement, It is conducted every four years for basic fourth and eight grades. The first round was held in 1995, the second round in 1999, the third round in 2003, the fourth round in 2007, the fifth round in 2011 and the sixth round in 2015. The science test for the eighth grade consists of basic sciences for each there is a limited weight: biology with a ratio of (35%), physics with a ratio of (25%), chemistry, land science and the environment with a ratio of (20%). The reqired skills are factual knowledge with a ratio of (35%), conceptual with a ratio of (35%) and Reasoning and Analysis with a ration of (30%). https://timssandandpirls.bc.edu/timss2015/frameworkshtml. The schools participating in the test are choser randomly. Students are given is minutes to answer each part of the test which includes 4 groups. As TIMSS being the largest study and worldly wide, and as it grants the participating countries the opportunity to measure performance levels and compare them internationally, Jordan has participated in five rounds of these tests. Table (1) shows a clear decline in the results of Jordanian students These results is an indicator that should be taken into account in order to identify the reasons behind this drawback for the purpose of developing the educational process. Weak points should be determined and eliminated to enable Jordanian students to return to international competition through the provision of qualitative education."}, {"section_title": "Theoretical Frame and Literature:", "text": "As TIMSS are an international instrument for measuring students' level in order to judge the outputs achieved through what has been determined in the general frame of curricula and assessment, Arab and foreign studies deat with these tests from several cores. Some analyzed the content of textbooks to identify their consistency with the requirements of this study (Law -son, Bodignon and Nagy, 2002; Chi hand and Ting, 2009; Abou Sa'eedi and Al -Mazeedi, 2013) , while other studies dealt with the teachers' success in these tests and students' cheracteristics and circumstances (Abu Aysh, res.ccsenet.org Vol. 10, No. 1; 2018 126 2008 and Al -Za'aneen, 2010 Al -Burhan and Theigarah, 2012) . Other studies cared a out the comparison between countries whose students obtained high results in international tests (Chihand and Ting, 2009; Al-Ghamidi, 2010; AlBurhan and Theigrah, 2012; Topcu, Erbiligin and Arkan, 2016) ."}, {"section_title": "Review of European Studies", "text": "Abu Aysh (2008) conducted a study with the aim of identifying the personal, scholastic and family factors of the eighth grade students participating in distinction tests, after classifying students into three categories based on their results. The study contributed 36% of the students' achievement in science to the teachers' practices and their use of teaching resources and parents' teaching.\nChihand's and Ting's study (2009) aimed at the coms parison between the content of science textbooks of the basic eighth grade in the USA and three countries: Singapore, Taiwan and Japan, whose students had the best results on the distinction test in 2007.\nThe result came in favor of the textbooks in the three countries which were distinguished from the American textbooks in the preparation of students for international tests. Saed and Hammouri (2010) conducted a study with the aim of revealing the role of practices and instructional resources in the eighth grade students' achievement in Jordan on the distinction tests of 2007. The study showed a role of thase practices, with different schools, in standents' achievement Al -Ghamdi (2010) conducted a study which comparced the characteristics of schools in china and Singa pore with those in Saudi Arabia \"The selection of the two countries came in light of the high students results on the distinction tests in 2007, through reviewing the principals views and the eighth grade students, the study concluded a result which states that big schools which are equipped with computers besides their principals suppart of students are of the important factors which a affect students learning Ambau Sa'eedi and AlMaseedi(2013) analyzed the textbooks of several grades, including the basic eighth grade in Oman \"The most prominent result of the study was that the explanation level in the textbooks in Oman was less than the ratio determined in the international study. However, the application level was higher than the international study. The study asked for searching for other factors.\nAl -Burhan and Theigrah (2012) conducted a comparative study between the evaluative practices of the teachers in Saudi Arabia with those in South Kerea, and the effect of these proctices on students' results in distinction tests in bath countries. The result was in favor of the teachers in South kerea, through the use of factual evaluation and their emphasis on the questions of search and inquiry and higher skills of thinking, which had its great impact on their students results in general distinction tests in 2007.\nTopcu, Erbilgin and Arkan (2016) tried to investigate the effcit of scholastic and social environment of Turkish students on their results on the international tests of distinction by comparing with Korean students obtaining advanced results in the international tests of distinction. The study found a difference in the examined factors in favor of the Turkish educational system, especially in regard to the classroom environment supporting students' learning, The study recommended the search for the role of content in the difference in students' performance. Topcu, Erbilg and Arkan (2016) tried to investigate the effect of scholastic and social environment of Tarkish students on their results on the international tests of distriction by comparing with Korean students obtaining advanced results in the international tests of distinction. The study found a difference in the examined factors in favor of the Turkish educational system, scream environment supporting students learning, the study recommended the search for the role of content in the difference in students' performance.\nThrough the review of all the previous studies, it clearly appears that there is interest in the results of distinction test as being a trae indicator of students' level among their peers in different countries. This was maaifest through the search for the factors wich affect students achievement. However, the studies mostly concentrate only on one specific factor which secors to have a role in students results. All esearchere, with their different studies, recommended further investigation about other factors wich may have a role in students results. There fore, this study came as an attempt to limi the factors which may be responsible for the low level of Jordanian eighth grade students results on international tests by asking very important categories in the educational system, namely, supervisors and teachers. To the researchers knowledge, it is the first study which tried to identify the reasons behind the low level of the results of Jordanian students in the international tests of distinction in 2015, based on the comprehensive inclusion of the schools whose students obtained low results from the vies of the teachers at those schools and the supervisors of the ministry of Education in the different directorates of education.\nStudy problem and its Questions: the results of international tests (TIMSS) are an important indicator of the teacing process. Ministry of Education participate in them in a desire to identify the level of students performance and the extent of the achievement of the purposes and visions witnessed by the ministry as they provide an effective and objective instrument to determine where the educational system stands and in which direction in Jordan, where the students results res.ccsenet.org Vol. 10, No. 1; 2018 express the wellbeing of the Jordanian educational system in its public and private schools, taking into account that its drawback in its final round (2015) was the highest since the first participation of Jordan. Tis stimulated the Ministry of Education to make education a national priority which requires work in the spirit of the one group in order to develop the educational systems (Ministry of Education, 2015) . As a result of what has previously mentioned, the present study came as a response to the repeated calls for revealing the reasons behind the drawback in the students' performance of the basic eighth grade in Jordan at the in ternational tests of distinction (TIMSS), with the aim of answering the following question:\nFirst Question: what are the reasons behind the low results of Jordanian eight grade students in international assessments (TIMSS) of science in 2015, as perceived by the supervisors and teachers of science?\nThe other Question: are there statistically significant differences in the reasons behind the low results of the Jordanian eighth grade students in the international assessments of science (TIMSS) in 2015, that could be attributed to job, sex, directorate of education and years of experience?\nStudy significance: The study is important because it came to fulfill the desire of the ministry of Education. Represented by its decision makers and from the supervising committees of preparing curricula and writing textbooks for the necessity of developing the teaching process, by identifying the reasors behind the drawback of Jordanian students performance in international tests (TIMSS), The study aims at identifying the reasons behind this drawback as perceived by the science teachers whose main role is the improvement of the teaching -learning process, and specifically teachers, curricula and students because they reflect the real fact of instructional situation at schools As for teachers, they help the aspirtions of the state, they reflect the real fact of the instructional situation at schools As for teachers, they help the aspiretions of the state, ministry and society to come true through their interaction with curriculum, management and students.\nThe importance of the study appears through the practical suggestions presented by teacherswhich could contribute in putting plans that promote teaching and achieve the needed improvement. The study will also provide researchers with an instrument that could be used in educational researches, and which may be the cornerstone for later research studies study limitabions: The study was limited to the supervisors and teachers of science at the schools whose students achievement was below general averae of the students of the kingdom in the science test of the eighth grade, within the international study (TIMSS) in 2015.\nAs it is shown in the results in Table ( 4), the particicipents in the study emphasized that manage meat is the most effective factor in the lower level of students results in the test (TIMSS) in 2015. For explaining this result, there will be a review of the arithmetic means and standard deviations of the items relating to the reasons of in Table (5) . Table ( 5) shows that the arithmetic means ranged between (3.79 -4.12). The item (35) which stated rareness of stimulation of students who excel in TIMSS came in the first rank with an arithmetic mean of (4.12), while the two items (32 and 37) which stated the non -organization of periodical meetings between eighth grade teachers, nonguidance of teach for achieving the aims of curriculam came in the last rank with an arithmetic mean of (3.79). The arithmetic meam of the reasons relating to management as a whole was (3.97).\nIt is noticed that one of the most prominent reasons relating to management, as perceived by the participants in the study, which led to the low level of students results in (TIMSS) test was the non -stimulation of the students who excel in this test. One of the most important factors emphasized by psychom-educational studies, is that if we want students to progress in any domein they should be positively stimulated (Levitt, 2001 ). This, as perceived by the two researchers, needs the support of management through the announcement of appreciation rewards for excelled studyents in TIMSS test, accompanied by an appreciation of the schools with high results and male and female teachers. There should also be special training courses for male and female teashers relating to this test, as well as periodical meetings between the eighth grade teachers in the different directorates of the kingdom and the training of pre -service part -time teachers.\nOf the experiments the two researchers like to refer to as an example of the role of the efficient management in supporting students learning in general and for the preparation of students for TIMSS test in particular, is what management in the uaited arab Emirates, (http://sycourse.com/uae/1223-timss) did through the preparation of two study appendixes for the two textbooks of mathematics and science according to the standards of the international tests of TIMSS tests, issued from the curricula management (2013 / 2014) in the frame of the continuous development of curricula in order to satisfy the students needs of knowledge and skills to obtain the asic results to make the students in the united Arab Emirates in competition with their peers in the world who sit for this test. This study in its result is consistent with the study of alGhamidi (2010) and the study of Topcu, Erbilgin and Arkan (2016).\nIt appears from the results of For explaining this result, the arithmetic means and standard deviations of the items telating to the reasons of content ranked from high to low according arithmetic means, will be reviewed in Table (6) . Table ( 6) shows that arithmetic means ranged between (3.64 -4.00). Item (43) which states \"the absence of seientific experiments with open ends\" came first rank, with an arithmetic mean of (4.00), whereas item (50) which states the nonequal time allowcated for study units in each textbook came last rank, with an arithmetic mean of (3.64). the arithmetic mean of the reasons relating to content as a whole was (3.81). There fore, the absence of scientific expecriments with open ends was one of the prominent reasons of the low level of students results in TIMSS as test perceived by people participating in the study.\nThe two researchere think that this result came as a result of the deficiency of content to activate the real rule of scientific experiments which does not make them as a way of repenting lessons (Luft and Roehrig, 2007) , but taken as a way of effective teaching methods of science in particular (Marting and Gerlouich, 2001 ) through the students conducting scientific experiments by using the tools, devices and materials which should be available at all schools, to be used in successive steps in order to solve scientific problems through the besic and integrated scientific processes (Simsek and kabapinar, 2010) . This cannot be without making the student explore and search for the results rather then being provided with them, as the student at the present time is capable of obtaining knowledge on his own through the fild investigation connected with his deily life in light of the concentration on providing students with scientific attitudes. This is not achieved as perceived by perticipants when a lot of teachers at the and of the instrument of the study emphasized the importance of this point and as it is evident in the previous table, with emphasis on, lot of concepts in the Jordanian textbook of science, and this is considered as a reason behind the low level of results, due to the short academic year compared with the allocated time.\nIt should be noticed that the item relating to the connection between the science textbook of the eighth grade in Jordan with TIMSS test came with an arithmetic mean of (3.62). In this way, it is not one of the highly effective reasons on Jordanian students results in TIMSS test. The result could be attributed to the fact that the content of Jordanian science textbook (http://www.moe.gov.jo) included various topics in physics, chemistry, biology and land sciences with a very res.ccsenet.org Vol. 10, No. 1; 2018 132 close degree to the determined ratios in the international tests (TIMSS). This signifies the need for the involvement of students in a greater degree of its learning after having sufficient learning of information by heart and its repettion, but it should be meaningfully understood (Taha, 2010) . There should be concentration on the real opportunities allocated for students learning through research and investigation, by concentrating on emore experimentation. The study is consistent with the studies of (Ambou Saeedi and Al -Mazeedi, 2013; Chihand and Ting, 2009 ).\nIt appears from the results of Table (4) that the domain of students was the third reason behind the low level of students results in TIMSS test. For explaining this result there will be a review of the arithmetic means and standard deviations of the items relating to the reasons domain of students ranked from highest to lost according to arithmetic means in Table ( Table (7) shows that the arithmetic means ranged from (3.49 -4.00), where the two items (1 and 4) stated \"students weakness in understanding abstract concepts\" and \"Students\" weakness in dealing with test question \"came first rank with an arithmetic mean of (4.00), while item (11) stated translation of test questions into Arabic affected students understanding came in the last rank arith an arithmetic mean of (3.49), and the mean of the reasons relating to students as a whole was (3.79).\nThis points out the fact that there was objectivity in the responses of people participating in the study, as they did not blame students for the low results, and in regard to the items included in the domain of students, their ability to deal with the test questions is a very important factor if not the mast important. This could be attributed to the non -training of students about the questions of the international test, and not giving them awareness of its importance and way of dealing with it. Students in eighth grade, as it has previously mentioned, are given 15 minates for answering each one of the four groups of the test. This time should be allocated by the student for answering, not for dealing with the test. The two researchers suggest that students shoud be given experimental tests during the academic year, with the purpose of students familiarity of the type and manner of dealing with it, with emphasizing that students should be aware of its importance and its role in developing Jordanian education in order to cope with challenges and changes in all domains.\nConcerning the weak comprehension of Jordanian eighth grade students of abstract concepts, it is avery important futar in res.ccsenet.org Vol. 10, No. 1; 2018 this study stage (Donovan and Bransford, 2005) , because the student's understanding of abstract concepts in science textbooks like (atoms and their electronic distribution, electricity and magnetism) and other topics in the science textbook affect their understanding of other science components such as principles, rules and scientific theories the study is consisat with the study of (Al -Ahmadi, 2011).\nThere should be a concentration on the student's mestery of both concrete and abstract concepts through self -learning based on the use of mind and hands because the formation and development of scientific concepts is a continuous process in gradation of difficulty from one grade to another and from one educational stage to another (Mok and Moshing, 2005) . This cannot happen without challengins students difficulties in understanding scientific concepts through the activation of the use of basic and infegtated processes of science inside and outside clessrooms. This cannot be through the mechanic learning be heart which is rapidly forgotten, but through the emphasis on the characteristics of scientific concepts and comparison between them and their explanation in light of previous teaching experiences.\nFinally, it appeared from the results of Table (4) that the domain of teachers came as the last factor of the reasons behind the low level of students results in TIMSS test. For explaining this result, there will be a review of the arithmetic means and stardard deviations of the items relating to the teachers reasons tanked from highest to loest according to arithmetic means in Table (8) . Table ( 8) shows that the arithmetic means ranged from (3.43 -4.14) where item (17), which states \"concentration of teechers on traditional methods in teaching process, came in the first rank, with an arithmetic mean of (4.14, while item (26), which statues not asking students to do assignments, came in the last rank, with an arithmetic meen of (3.43). The arithmetic mean, relating to teachers reasons as a whole, was (3.72). The result assures in spite of a lot of Arab and foreign studies which concluded the positive impact of madern methods of teaching at all different stages of education on students achievement, understanding and concepts, teachers still stick to traditional methods (North cote, 2005) , despite the several conkses which emphasize the modern teacheing methods that view students as the core of the teacking process. Teachers ratura to their role dictation, asking sturdeuts to listen to the content in a way that restricts the learner's activity, efficiency and knowledge growth (Zeitoun, 2010) . Teachers belifefs o teaching methods become an issue of great importance (Yahya, 2011) as they reflect in a direct way what they prectise at schools. This can be of modrn technologies in teaching, with an arithmetic mean of (4.03), in a clear recognition of teachers and educational supervisors participating in the study; however in spite of the fact that modern technologies, at this age, represented in the computer with its programs, the internet with its applications and what has been derived from them like multimedia, form a rit environment for scientific investigation and the understanding of the topics of science textbook like the earth layers, movement, force, chemical changes and variety in the environments and living things, the teachers roles have not coped with the challenges and changes in the technical development which the ministry seeks to push it forward. This could be due to factors such as res.ccsenet.org Vol. 10, No. 1; 2018 crowded classrooms or the real non -competency of teachers in using modern technologies, in spite of their rehabilitating courses or because of the non -preparation of computer labs for students.\nIt's the traditional view about the teaching process is not restricted to the teaching methods used by teachers, it is not strange that teachers do not vary the use of assessment and evaluation intstruments, and the arithmetic mean for the item which states that is (4.00). the achievement tests are the only mesure which allows the student to move from one grade to another and from one stage to another. The two researchers assure that if we want assessment to be effective for its purpose, it is necessary that it should include several methods, aids and instrument (Tsai, 2002) , because it is not longer accepted for the measure of students. Success to be determined by the amount of what they learn by heart, but there should be concerntration of its performance competencies through teachers variation of assessment methods. The study is consistent with the studies of Saed and Hammouri, 2010; Abut Ayash, 2008; Al -Za'aneen, 2010 and Al -Burhan and Theigarah, 2012 . Table ( 9) shows the existence of statistically significant differences (\u03b1=0.05) that could be attributed to the effect of job in all the domains and in the whole degree, in favor of the educational supervisor.\nSecond: Sex It appears from Table ( 10) the non -existence of statistically significant differences (\u03b1=0.05) that could be attributed to the effect of sex in all domeins and in the total degree.\nThird: the directorate of education: Table ( 12) whows the non -existence of statistically significant differences (\u03b1 = 0.05) that could be attributed to the directorate of education in all domains and in the instrument as a whole, except for the reasons relating to management. For revealing the statistically significant differences between the arithmetic means past comparisons were used as shown in Table ( 13) Table ( 13) shows the existence of statistically significant differences (\u03b1-0.05) between north, and middle in favor of middle.\nFourth: experience: Table (14) . the erith metic means and standard deviations of the reasons of the low level of Jordanian sic eights grade student results in the international assessments of science in 2015, asperveived by the teachers and supervisors of science due to the differences, in the categories of experience variable. For relealin the significance of statistical differences ANOVA analysis was used as Table (15) shows the non -existence of statistically significant differences (\u03b1 = 0.05) that could be attributed to experience in all domains, except for the domain of the reasons relating to teacher and the total degree. And for revcaling statistically significant pair differences between the arithmetic meens, the post comparisons using method were used as Table ( Table ( 16) shows the existence of statistically significant differences (\u03b1 = 0.05)between (6-10) years and more than that; the differences carre in favor of 6-10 years in the reasons relating to teachers and total degree. The previous results could be attributed to the fact that educational supervisor at the directorate of education from north to south passing by middle have more experience and deeper vision of the real facts of the ministry of education, in a way that is reflected on the analysis of facts by segmenting them into their elements and partial components, in order to the in fluencies relationships between the part and the whole and part and other parts to determine and derive meaning ful significance for the explanation of the reasons behind the low level of Jordanian students result in this international test. In regard to the nonexistence of statistically significant differences that could be attributed to sex, this may explain that the impact of the four domains of the study on Jordanian students results is nearly greatly similar at male, female and mixed schools in the Ministry of Education.\nres.ccsenet.org Vol. 10, No. 1; 2018 Concerning the existence of statistically significant differences in the study results relating to the domain of management as a responsible factor for the low level of students results in TIMSS test at schools located in the middle, that could be attributed to the high number of the directorates of education there, whose number is (23), in comparison with (14) in the north.\nThe statistically significant differences relating to teachers as a reason behind the low level of students results, as perceived by participants in the study whose experiences ranged from (6-10) years, compared with those whose experience exceeded ten years, could be attributed to the fact that the participants in this category believe that teachers should adopt structural beliefs and practices that from a firm foundation for any developmental efforts in the I ministry of education as a whole and in regard to TIMSS test, in particular as these directly are reflected on students in a way thank overcomes the impact of content and school management."}, {"section_title": "Procedural Definition of the Study Idioms:", "text": "Basic Eighth Grade: it represents the ninth year of the students study at schools, in which the student is 14 years of.

The instrument in its final form consisted of (51) items to be answered by the study sample, Lickert's five gradation was ased, where strongly agree was given five points, agree was given four points, neutral was given three poines, disagree was given two points and strongly disagree was given one point.\nValidity of study instrument: to make sure of the validity of the instrument, it was shown to a group of (13) judges specialized in Arabic language and educational sciences. The judges pointed out a group of remarks about the clarity and appropriateness of some items, recommended the linguistic reformation of some items and the omission of other items. All of their remarks were taken in the study instrument in its final form.\nReliability of the study instrument: to make sure of the reliability of the study, it was verified through test and retest through the application of the scale and reapplication, after twecks, on a group of (30) outside the study sample. Then pearson's correlation foefficient was calculated between their two estimates. Reliability coefficient was also calculated by the way of internal consistency a ccording to crondbakh alpha. Table ( 3) shows the coefficient of internal consistency according cronbakh alpha formula and thereliability of repetction of the domains and the instrument as a whole. These values were considered appropriate for the purposes of this study. as shown in Table ( The scale was calculated through the use of the following formala:\nThe highest limit of the scale (5) -the lowest (1)"}, {"section_title": "Study Variable:", "text": "First: independent variables: job which has two levels (Supervisor / teacher), sex with two levels (male / female), years of experience with three levels (1-5 years/ 6-10 years / more then 10 years), the dire crate with three levels (north / south / middle).\nSecond: dependent variables: they are the reasons behind the low level of Jordanian eighth grade eighth grade students results in the international assessments (TIMSS) in 2015 with four levels (Content, teachers, students and management."}, {"section_title": "Study results and discussion:", "text": "First Question: what are the reasons behind the low level of Jordanian eighth grade students results in the international assessments of science in 2015 as perceived by the teachers and supervisors of science? To answer this question, arithmetic means and standard deviations of the reasons of the low level of Jordanian basic eighth grade students results in the international assessments of science in 2015 were calculated as perceived by the teachers and supervisors of science. The following table (4) explains this. The results of Table ( 4) show that the arithmetic means range between (3.72 -3.97). The reasons relating to management came first rank with the highest arithmetic mean (3.72) and the arithmetic mean of the instrument as a whole was (3.81). This result a ssures in the first degree that any progress or drawback in the students level is due to all these four factors.\nAnd if the teaching -learning process in Jordan to be developed, the weak points in each domain should be determined, res.ccsenet.org Vol. 10, No. 1; 2018 with the aim of eliminating them and creating a positive change in order to bring out a qualitative movement in basic education."}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "text": "In light of the present study, and as a desite from the two researchers to contribute in the diagnosis of the reasons behind the low level of Jordanian basic eighth grade students in TIMSS test in 2015, the researchers recommend the following results:"}]
