However, habitat loss in intervening areas has been hypothesized potentially to impede the movements of these species. Populations near range margins offer opportunities to study how marginal species have reacted to habitat loss. We examined the presence/absence of bird species in landscapes that were historically mainly forested (natural land covers) in Southern Ontario, Canada. We used logistic regression to determine each bird species' probability of occupancy (p occ ) as a function of natural cover in 991 landscapes, each 100-km 2 .\nWe distinguished three groups of species: i) southerly species whose northern range limits fall in the study area (n=37), ii) northerly species whose southern range limits fall in the study area (n=35), and iii) mid-range species (n=106). We compared p occ for these three groups of species in six different habitat guilds. We found that species near their southern range edges are less likely to occur in landscapes where forest amount is reduced, while species near their northern range edge are more likely to occur in landscapes with reduced forest. This result is independent of habitat guild. Our results are inconsistent with the hypothesis in the climate change literature proposing that loss of natural land cover near poleward range margins would inhibit range expansion in response to climatic warming. Rather, we hypothesize that, at southern range edges, the dual stresses of climatic warming and forest conversion both reduce species' ability to occupy a landscape. However, near northern (potentially expanding) range edges, partially disturbed landscapes are more readily invaded than undisturbed landscapes.\npotentially lead to larger population sizes and range expansion (Davies et al. 2006 ). However, as species' ranges expand poleward (Parmesan et al. 2003 ), a lack of undisturbed habitat could, in principle, prevent species from occupying newly climatically suitable areas (Sieving et al. 1996 , Travis 2003 , Opdam et al. 2004 , Lawler et al. 2013 Robillard et al. 2015) . For example, in a recent study with Europeans birds, Oliver et al. (2017) showed that greater land use intensity exacerbates the decline of species adapted to cold places (northerly species) and prevents increases in abundances of species adapted to warmer places (southerly species). Melles et al. (2011) showed that range expansion of the Hooded Warbler (Wilsonia citrina) is primarily driven by trends of warmer temperatures in southern Ontario, Canada. The authors speculated, however, that habitat connectivity might slow the species' range expansion. Alternatively, species colonizing novel areas may actually do better in partially disturbed environments. The reasons are several. Such areas may have reduced \"biotic resistance\" (Guo et al. 2012 , Gonz\u00e1lez-Moreno et al. 2015 . Human-modified landscapes can be highly productive and have high structural complexity (Swanson et al. 2011) . Some bird species prefer open habitats, while others prefer forest (Cadman et al. 2007) . Thus, mixtures of land cover types offer a greater diversity of potential habitats than does uniform natural land cover (De Camargo et al. 2015) . Desrochers et al. (2011) found that avian species richness in 100-km 2 landscapes in Ontario, Canada, is a peaked function of the ratio of natural to human-dominated land covers. Their result suggested that natural land cover conversion and fragmentation may not pose a barrier to shifting species' ranges in landscapes with more than \u223c40% natural cover.\nMarginal populations may offer a good opportunity to test whether species respond differently to land cover conversion at northern, versus southern, limits of their ranges. Overall, smaller population size and lower genetic variability in edge-populations could increase extinction proneness (e.g., \"central-marginal\" hypothesis, Eckert et al. 2008) . Conversion of natural land covers to human-dominated land covers could harm marginal populations through spatial isolation, habitat fragmentation, or heterogeneity that reduces gene flow (Eckert et al. 2008) . Near their southern range edges, northerly populations might be more prone to extinction due to climate conditions that exceed individual species' tolerances (Kirkpatrick & Barton 1997 , Hampe & Petit 2005 , Anderson et al. 2009 , Sunday et al. 2012 , which ultimately determine limits of a species' niche (Brown 1984 , Parmesan et al. 2005 . For instance, bird populations in protected areas of Finland have experienced increased population densities at the (leading) northern edge of species' ranges and decreased density at the (trailing) southern edge (Virkkala et al. 2011 (Virkkala et al. , 2014 . Northwards range shifts of bird species in eastern North America appear to be driven mainly by climatic variables, and southern-edge boundaries are moving northwards faster the northern-edge limits (Zuckerberg et al. 2009 ).\nIn this study, we test the following hypothesis: at their northern range limits, southerly avian species are generally more likely to occupy landscapes in which moderate amounts of natural land cover have been converted to human-dominated land cover. Near their southern range limits, northerly avian species are generally less likely to occupy landscapes with significant amounts of human-dominated land cover. We refer to \"natural land cover\", rather than \"habitat\", because habitat is species-specific. Our focus in this study is the overall response of avian species to anthropogenic land modification; species richness clearly depends upon the amount of natural land cover in an area (Pereira et al. 2006 , Fahrig 2013 . However, we also test our hypothesis with several avian habitat guilds. We speculated that moderate disturbance of natural land cover makes landscapes more favourable for species whose ranges are expanding into an area and less favourable for species that are already established in the area. Our hypothesis, if supported, implies that natural habitat conversion does not in fact inhibit species' ability to track changing climate.\nMost studies of northern and southern range edges have considered a fixed set of species in different geographic regions. Here, we use a complementary approach: we examined a single region in which a large number of both northern and southern range limits occur. This approach has the advantage that it avoids the confounding effects of environmental variables other than land cover that may also differ between southern-edge and northern-edge boundaries. This approach has the disadvantage that we examine different sets of species at southern, versus northern, range boundaries."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Overview", "text": "We address the questions above using a \"natural experiment\".

Prior to European settlement, southern Ontario was covered mainly by forest and wetlands (Warwick 1980 , Puric-Mladenovic 2011 .

European colonization brought extensive logging and land clearing for farming in the 18th -19th centuries (Warwick 1980) . By the early 20th century, intensive logging had finished (Elliott 1998) , and by the mid-20th century, government programs promoted afforestation, selective harvesting, and silviculture on private woodlots in southern Ontario (Perera, A.H., Euler, D.L. and Thompson 2000) . As a result of decreased agriculture and forestry, the amount of forest cover has been relatively stable for the last 70 years 1 . However, fire suppression and selective harvesting have favoured deciduous species at the expense of conifers in remaining forest, both within the study area and further north (Jackson et al. 2000) We determined the proportions of different land covers within 100-km 2 UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) quadrats (hereafter, landscapes) covering the study area. Remotely sensed land cover data were obtained from the Ontario Provincial Scale Land Cover data set produced by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (2002) from Landsat 7 Thematic Mapper 2 scenes captured primarily in the 1990s (resampled to a 30-m resolution). Land cover had been classified into 28 land cover classes. We grouped these classes into two broad categories: \"human-dominated\" land covers and \"natural\" covers. Human-dominated land covers include seven classes, including recent cutovers, mine tailings, quarries, bedrock outcrops, settlement and developed land, pasture and abandoned field, and cropland. Within human-dominated covers, 76% is cropland (row crops, hay, or open soil), while the rest (24%) corresponds mainly to recent cutovers, mining, urban areas, and pastures. Natural land covers (those with relatively little recent anthropogenic disturbance) include nine classes of forest cover, including older forest clear-cuts and forest fires, and seven classes of wetlands. Forests constitute 97% of the total area in the natural category. We excluded water and unclassified land cover in the calculation of % natural area. Five other classes in the original land-cover classification did not occur in the study area. The current landscapes in the region vary from entirely natural to entirely human-dominated land covers."}, {"section_title": "Bird species distributions", "text": "We used bird species distributions in southern Ontario (Canada) reported in the 2005 Atlas of the Breeding Birds of Ontario (ABBO) ( Fig. 1b-d , Cadman et al. 2009 ). The ABBO reports the presence or absence of breeding bird species in the 100-km 2 UTM quadrats in southern Ontario. Volunteer ornithologists searched each ABBO landscape as thoroughly as possible for evidence of breeding birds over a five-year period, 2000-2005. We excluded the data from the northern parts of the province where the ABBO quadrats were much larger (10 4 km 2 ) and sampling intensity was much lower. We also excluded wedge-shaped UTM quadrats and quadrats overlapping the Great Lakes that were >10% water to minimize variation in area among landscapes.\nSampling effort positively influences species detection, and sampling intensity varies considerably among landscapes. We excluded landscapes with the most extreme observer effort (<20 or >600 hours) (Cadman et al. 2007 ) because these points had disproportionately high leverage in our models. We then used sampling effort in the remaining quadrats as a covariate in our models. These sampling effort criteria included a total of 202 species (Table S1 ). Next, we eliminated 18 species that occurred in <3% or >90% of the quadrats (i.e., they are quite rare or nearly ubiquitous) because the probability of occupancy of these species is essentially independent of environmental variables (Jim\u00e9nez-Valverde et al. 2008) . We also eliminated six species for which logistic regression models did not converge. These selection criteria left 178 bird species in 991 landscapes (see the complete list of included and excluded species in Table S1 .1, Appendix S1).\nIn each landscape, we tallied total species richness, as well as richness in six guilds defined by preferred habitat, as characterized in Cadman et al. (2009) . We distinguished six categories. Edge species: specialist species more commonly found close to forest edges than in the interior forest (n=16 species). Interior-edge species: species found throughout forested land cover (n=27). Interior species: specialist species totally dependent on forest interior to nest and/or to feed (n=33). Open Habitat species: species commonly found in grasslands, disturbed woodlands, scrub or hills / mountains (n=45). Urban species: species adapted to live in cities, nesting in buildings, backyards, light posts, among others (n=8).

The second group, \"southerly species\", includes species whose ranges reach their northern limit in the study area and the range extends farther south (n=37, Fig. 1 ). The third group, \"mid-range species\", includes species whose ranges extend over the entire study area (n=106 species, Fig. 1, Table S1 .1, Fig. S1 .1, Appendix S1).

Many northerly species in southern Ontario are mainly associated with the coniferous boreal forests of the Laurentian Shield (gray area in Fig. 1b ), while many southerly species are associated with the mixed-wood forests bordering the Great Lakes (Fig. 1d) . However, the distributions of these species' groups are not strictly limited to the biomes where they are most common, and there is no distinct boundary between the two (Fig. 1) ."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "First, we modelled individual species' probability of occurrence (p occ ) in each ABBO landscapes as a function of the proportion of natural cover. We considered a species to be present in a landscape if there was confirmed or probable evidence of breeding in the landscape. We considered a species as being absent from a landscape if evidence of breeding was lacking and if that landscape fell within 20 km of an occupied landscape. Otherwise, the quadrat was considered out-of-range, and it was excluded from analysis for that species. This limits the data to occupied quadrats and neighbouring unoccupied quadrats. Land cover can vary dramatically from one 100-km 2 landscape to the next, whereas unoccupied landscapes farther away may be unoccupied for a varied of other reasons: unsuitable climate, dispersal barriers, historical factors, etc. Note that this exclusion criterion does not yield a paired study design; rather, it is intended to ensure that the distributions of environmental variables other than land cover are similar in occupied and unoccupied quadrats (in order to minimize collinearity).\nWe related the probability that a species will occupy a given landscape, p occ , to varying proportions of natural cover using logistic regression models in which the species' presence and absence is fitted as a quadratic function of natural area (A) and log-transformed sampling effort (log 10 Effort) within landscapes in the study area, as follows: with a logit link. We used the quadratic term in the logistic model because it allows maximal occupancy to occur in landscapes with intermediate proportions of natural cover.

Then, we calculated each species' sensitivity ( i \u00d9 ) to a given proportion of natural land cover i below 100% as the log of the ratio of predicted probability of occurrence \u02c6o cc \u03c1 within landscapes with reduced natural cover (e.g., 15% natural cover), relative to the probability of occurrence with 100% natural cover:\nis the predicted probability of occurrence of a species in a landscape with i% natural cover, calculated from 5%, to 95%, and is the predicted probability of occupancy at 100% natural cover.

The objective here is to compare how different groups of species respond to the amount of natural cover in the landscape.

In fact, 66% of all species showed i \u2126 >0 in landscapes with moderate amount of natural cover conversion (e.g., 50%), meaning that they are more likely to occur in partly disturbed landscapes than in undisturbed natural cover (Fig. 2b) .\nHowever, at lower levels of forest cover (e.g., below 25%), the probability of occupancy does decline substantially for all guilds, except for urban species (Fig. 2a) . Most forest-interior species were sensitive to landscapes with low forest cover, but perhaps surprisingly, 30% of interior-edge species did not have a lower probability of occurrence at 15% forest cover, relative to 100% (Fig. 2a) . In landscapes with very little forest, even open-habitat species and wetland species are less likely to occur than at 100% natural cover (Fig. 2a) .\nThe effect of extensive conversion of natural land cover to human-dominated covers varies strongly among the three geographic groups of species, and among species guilds (Table 1 & 2) . At low proportions of natural covers (e.g., 15%), northerly species had on average significantly reduced probability of occurrence ( Fig. 3) in the study region, whereas southerly species had on average significantly greater probability of occurrence than in landscapes with 100% natural cover (Fig. 3) . For mid-range species, the mean ratio of the predicted probability of occupancy at 15% forest cover, relative to 100% forest cover ( % 15 \u2126 ), differs among habitat guilds, but, overall, the mean is close to zero.

The literature often suggests that in northern hemisphere mid-latitudes, northern-edge populations should therefore expand their range limits northwards, while southern-edge populations potentially retract (Parmesan et al. 1999 , Thomas et al. 1999a , Brommer 2004 , Chen et al. 2011 , and that anthropogenic habitat modification could pose additional challenges for these marginal species (Opdam et al. 2004 , Oliver et al. 2009 , Melles et al. 2011 . The literature also suggests that habitat loss and fragmentation could block the expansion of ranges of marginal species northwards as temperatures increase (Warren et al. 2001 , Opdam et al. 2004 , Manning et al. 2009 , Mantyka-Pringle et al. 2012 , Oliver et al. 2015 . For example, habitat loss may have impeded habitat-specialist butterflies to track warmer temperatures in the UK (Warren et al. 2001) .\nSimilarly, landscape attributes (e.g., configuration and size of patches) may influence populations of woodland bird species: winter temperatures have harsher effects on birds that occupy more isolated habitat patches (Newson et al. 2014) .\nIn contrast, in earlier works in this study area, we found that species richness is maximal in landscapes with \u223c50% natural land cover (Desrochers et al. 2011 , De Camargo & Currie 2015 . At this proportion of natural land cover, ~20% of bird species showed reduced probability of occupancy, ~80% had higher probability of occupancy (Fig. 2) . For the species studied here, conversion of some forested cover to human-dominated covers does not necessarily have negative impacts. Probability of occupation declined significant only at the highest amounts of natural cover loss (Fig. 2) .\nHere, we find that the effect of forest conversion is not geographically uniform, even within habitat guilds. Northern-edge populations of southerly species increased on average by ~80% their probability of occupancy, independently of guild habitat (Fig. 3) . Perhaps surprisingly, even the probability of occupancy of southerly forest-interior species was ~50-100% higher in areas with reduced natural cover (Fig. 3) . Hence, this result does not support the proposition that reduced forest cover poses a barrier to species' occupancy and presumably to the movement of species tracking warmer temperatures.\nSome open-habitat bird species commonly found farther south of the study area appear to benefit from land cover conversion and northward warming temperatures. Our analysis showed, for example, that the Eastern Bluebird (Sialia sialis), a southerly grassland species that breeds near its northern range edge in the study area, has p occ >80% higher in landscapes with 15% forest cover than in fully forested landscape. It has been suggested that its abundance has increased dramatically, potentially due to warmer temperatures, in southern Ontario since the 1970s (Cadman et al. 2009 , Varrin et al. 2007 .\nModerate reduction of natural covers may favour species' occurrence irrespective of whether a species is \u2126 , relative to the probability of occupancy at 100% forest cover, within landscapes of southern Ontario, Canada. This ratio is shown for three geographic range groups (mid-range-, northerly-, and southerly-species) divided into six habitat guilds (i.e., mean ratio of \u02c6o cc \u03c1 at 15% to 100% natural cover).

The current study does not address the mechanisms that generate this pattern. It is possible that interspecific competition may be reduced by some level of environmental disturbance: experimental studies have shown the importance of competition in regulating community structure along disturbance gradient (Campbell et al. 1992 , Turkington et al. 1993 , Violle et al. 2010 . For example, habitat fragmentation could facilitate the access of nest predators or parasites into forest patches and reduce the reproductive success of the most abundant forest birds (Robinson et al. 1995) . Some nectarivorous birds that are normally numerically dominant in south-eastern Australia had their flower visitation patterns disrupted by Noisy Miners (Manorina melanocephala, an aggressive species of honeyeater) in disturbed fragments when the nectarivorous birds were more abundant than the Noisy Miners (Bennett et al. 2014) . Different responses of southerly and northerly populations to environmental changes might reflect differences in the factors that determine those boundaries. For example, it has long been suggested that abiotic stressors are more important in limiting species' ranges at the harsh poleward edge, whereas biotic interactions should be more important at the climatically benign tropical edge (MacArthur 1972 , Kaufman et al. 1995 . Some literature has suggested that species' equatorward boundaries are stable despite climate change (Hampe et al. 2005 ). Yet, propose the opposite. Studying temporal responses of 34 passerine bird' ranges to temperature in North America, they found that equatorward range boundaries are closer to the upper realized thermal niche limits than poleward range boundaries are to the lower thermal limit. results suggest that equatorward populations are more strongly affected by abiotic factors, in this case temperature.\nWe speculate that, for northerly species in southern Ontario, the triple stresses of physiologically extreme temperatures (Hewitt 2000 , Hampe et al. 2005 , reduced natural forest cover, and competition from invading species from the south act together to reduce many species' probability of occurrence. Northerly species such as Cape May Warbler (Dendroica tigrina), Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), and Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus), all forest-interior species, showed extremely low p occ in landscapes with reduced natural land cover (Table S1 .1, Appendix S1). Some species that can be found in open forests or grass patches such as Tennessee Warbler (Vermivora peregrine) or Philadelphia Vireo (Vireo philadelphicus) also had lower p occ with less human-dominated, mainly open, land cover. Although it is impossible to determine precisely whether habitat availability or climate are the proximal mechanisms lowering the species probability of occurrence of the species near the southern edge of their range, an interaction between the two stressors is plausible Mantyka-Pringle et al. 2015) . In contrast, northern-edge populations may benefit from increasingly favourable temperatures.\nIn principle, one can study species' responses to land cover at northern and southern range limits either by using a) the same species in two different regions (at northern and southern range limits) or b) different species in the same region (as in this study). The disadvantages of design a) are that it is likely to be difficult to get similar ranges of natural land cover in the North and the South, and other environmental variables are likely to be collinear with land cover. The main disadvantage of b) is that northerly and southerly species may have very different habitat requirements. For example, northerly species include more forest-interior species, while southerly species are more often associated with open-habitat ( Table 2 ). The patterns we reported above may reflect in part differences in the biology of avian species in the mainly coniferous northerly forests versus the mainly deciduous southerly forests. Note, however, that habitat type presumably does not limit the probability of occurrence of mid-range species within the study area because these species occur both further north and further south. The probability of occurrence of mid-range species is not strongly dependent on forest cover (Figure 3 ). Once again, this is inconsistent with the proposition that reduced forest cover will be a barrier to species movement in the face of climate change.\nIn closing, we note that our interpretation of the potential interaction between climate and land cover reduction is based entirely on correlations through space. Time series data would provide a stronger test of the effect of land cover conversion on species' probabilities of occupancy. While we would have liked to use time series data, changes in land cover in recent decades in this region have been too small to detect their effect (Desrochers et al. 2017) . Instead, we used spatial gradients of land cover. Those results suggest that partial conversion of natural, mainly forested, land cover to human-dominated, mainly open land cover in Southern Ontario, does not appear to pose a serious barrier to the colonization of areas that become climatically suitable due to global climate change."}]
