The cyclone made a landfall over Myanmar on 2 May, causing catastrophic destruction (Webster 2008) . The genesis of Nargis in April was earlier than the climatological season of tropical cyclogenesis over the North Indian Ocean, which is around May-June (Kikuchi and Wang 2009) . To prevent TC disasters, one of the most important challenges is to predict the probability of tropical cyclogenesis. The conditions under which TCs are likely to be generated are determined by large-scale environmental fields such as moist static stability and atmospheric circulation. Over most of the oceans, the environmental field favorable for tropical cyclogenesis occurs for several months between spring and autumn; however, the North Indian Ocean is a unique basin that has two short seasons of tropical cyclogenesis each year: May-June and October-November (Camargo et al. 2007; Kikuchi and Wang 2009) . Hereafter, we refer to the former (latter) as the onset (withdrawal) season of the Asian summer monsoon (ASM), in the sense that these seasons mark the transitions between the ASM and the Asian winter monsoon. Given that the timing of TC season may vary from year to year, it is of interest to assess whether environmental modulation during the ASM onset season in 2008 is able to explain the climatologically early tropical cyclogenesis of Nargis. In addition, the Bay of Bengal is a suitable region to determine the environmental region responsible for tropical cyclogenesis since it is isolated from other oceans by land on its northern, eastern, and western margins.\nPrevious studies have suggested several environmental factors that are favorable for tropical cyclogenesis including typhoons, hurricanes, and Indian ocean cyclones (Gray 1975; Emanuel and Nolan 2004; Camargo et al. 2007 ). Because condensational heating in cumulus convection plays an essential role in generating the available potential energy of TCs, a number of environmental factors relevant to tropical cyclogenesis are related to the dynamics of cumulus convection, including sea surface temperature (SST), moist static instability, and midtropospheric humidity. Gray (1975) suggested that lower tropospheric relative vorticity plays an important role in maintaining cumulus convection by the continuous supply of water vapor in the Ekman layer. These factors related to cumulus convection are necessary but not su\u2030cient conditions for tropical cyclogenesis. Gray (1975) stated that planetary vorticity (the e\u00a4ect of earth's rotation, Coriolis parameter) is necessary to sustain the circulation of a TC. In fact, TCs rarely form near the equator because of small planetary vorticity despite the environment being favorable for cumulus convection. In addition, tropical cyclogenesis requires weak vertical shear of horizontal wind to ensure that it does not ventilate away the heat accumulated by cumulus convection. Gray (1975) proposed the ''genesis parameter,'' an index of the large-scale environment for tropical cyclogenesis, based on the following six factors: ocean heat capacity, vertical gradient of equivalent potential temperature, midtropospheric humidity, planetary vorticity, relative vorticity, and vertical shear of horizontal wind. This index explains the global distribution and seasonal transition of observed tropical cyclogenesis. Recently, Emanuel and Nolan (2004) developed a new index termed ''genesis potential (GP)'' based on the following four factors: potential intensity, midtropospheric humidity, absolute vorticity (relative vorticity plus planetary vorticity), and vertical shear of horizontal wind. On the basis of the thermodynamics of a TC (Bister and Emanuel 2002) , the e\u00a4ects of SST and moist static instability are indirectly considered via potential intensity (see Section 2). Camargo et al. (2007) demonstrated that the GP index can explain the frequency of tropical cyclogenesis associated with seasonal transition and El Ni\u00f1 o Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Camargo et al. (2009) also applied the index to environmental modulation at an intraseasonal time scale (several ten days) related to Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO; Madden and Julian 1972) .\nLarge-scale environmental modulation may be a useful factor in the numerical prediction of tropical cyclogenesis. It is generally di\u2030cult to predict the precise location and timing of individual TCs since the formation of an initial weak vortex is sensitive to small errors in the initial data and physical processes in numerical models. However, it may be more feasible to predict the occurrence of periods with a high probability of cyclogenesis, provided that the environmental field favorable for tropical cyclogenesis is modulated in at a period of less than 1 month. Therefore, it is of interest to examine whether a numerical model can predict the high probability of the genesis of TC Nargis in late April 2008.\nThe purpose of the present study is to investigate the relation between the genesis of Nargis and the large-scale environment using reanalysis data and a cloud-system resolving model. Environmental fields, including the GP index and monsoon index, are examined using atmospheric and ocean-surface reanalysis data with temporal and spatial filters. The probability of Nargis's genesis is simulated by a stretched-grid global atmospheric model that explicitly resolves mesoscale cloud systems around the Bay of Bengal with a horizontal grid spacing of less than 14 km. Although the main focus of the present study is the large-scale environmental field, a high resolution model was preferable for the following reasons: (1) the large-scale environment, including intraseasonal oscillations, may be simulated more accurately by a cloud-system resolving model (Miura et al. 2007a; Oouchi et al. 2009 ); and (2) the explicit representation of TC structures such as the radius of maximum wind (50-100 km) helps avoid the use of artificial definition of simulated TCs that has been used in low resolution simulations (Walsh et al. 2007) .\nThe remainder of the manuscript is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the methodology employed in data analysis and numerical simulation, and section 3 provides an analysis of the environmental field related to Nargis's genesis. Section 4 presents the results of numerical simulation, and section 5 discusses the results of data analysis and numerical simulations. Finally, section 6 summarizes the relation between Nargis's genesis, the environmental field, and numerical predictability."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Reanalysis and observation data", "text": "The large-scale environmental field analyzed in this study comprised daily data on the atmosphere and ocean surface for 2008 and other years . We used atmospheric analysis data provided by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI): the Japanese 25-year ReAnalysis (JRA-25) is a product for the period between 1979 and 2004 (Onogi et al. 2007) , and the JMA Climate Data Assimilation System (JCDAS) is for the period since 2005. Because JCDAS is based on the same system as that employed by JRA-25, the two products, when combined, provide a homogeneous datasets for the period from 1979 to 2008. The longitudinal and latitudinal resolutions of the products are 1.25\n. The original 6-hourly dataset of JRA-25/ JCDAS was averaged every four time steps to create a daily dataset. The analysis data of SST has been the product of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Optimum Interpolation (OI) since late 1981, which uses in situ and satellite data (Reynolds et al. 2002) . The original weekly dataset of OI-SST with a horizontal resolution of 1 was linearly interpolated in time and space to create a daily dataset on the same grid system as that used in the atmospheric dataset.\nInformation regarding the locations and intensities of individual TCs was derived from a besttrack dataset obtained from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) for the period 1982-2008. Here, tropical cyclogenesis is defined as the time when the surface wind speed of the best-track data reached an operational definition of a ''named storm'' (@17 ms \u00c01 ); Zehr (1992) suggested that a wind speed in excess of @17 ms \u00c01 is necessary for a TC to intensify via self-sustaining mechanisms. The cloud pattern was obtained from globally merged infrared (IR) brightness temperature data (equivalent blackbody temperature) provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)."}, {"section_title": "Environmental field and indices", "text": "In any analysis of the environmental field of tropical cyclogenesis, it is important that the time scale and horizontal scale of environmental modulation are longer than those of the TC itself, because the TC transiently and partially influences the environmental field. To avoid this problem as much as possible, the environmental field was obtained using temporal and spatial filters. The time filter was a 15-day running mean, and the spatial filter was a slightly modified version of that proposed by Kurihara et al. (1993) , which completely removes components with wavelengths less than 8.75\n(7 grid points). Here, these temporally and spatially filtered data are referred to as the environmental field.\nThe index of the environmental field favorable for tropical cyclogenesis was the GP proposed by Emanuel and Nolan (2004); Camargo et al. (2007) , which is defined on the basis of four environmental factors:\nwhere h is the absolute vorticity at 850 hPa (s \u00c01 ), H is the relative humidity at 600 hPa (%), V pot is the potential intensity (ms \u00c01 ), and V shear is the magnitude of the vertical wind shear between 850 and 200 hPa (ms \u00c01 ). The potential intensity V pot considers SST and vertical profiles of temperature and specific humidity in the troposphere and is defined as\nwhere T s is SST, T 0 is the mean outflow temperature at the level of neutral buoyancy, C k is the exchange coe\u2030cient for enthalpy, C D is the drag coefficient, CAPE \u00c3 is the convective available potential energy (CAPE) for an air parcel at the radius of maximum winds, and CAPE b is CAPE for an air parcel lifted from the lowest data grid (1000 hPa) in the ambient atmosphere (Bister and Emanuel 2002; Camargo et al. 2007) .\nThe index for the summer monsoon over the Bay of Bengal was meridional temperature gradient (MTG) in the upper troposphere (200-500 hPa). Mao and Wu (2007) showed that change in the sign of the area averaged upper tropospheric MTG over the eastern Bay of Bengal (90 E-100 E) is a good index of the summer monsoon onset over the region. The present study used the same index as that proposed by Mao and Wu (2007) except that the MTG was averaged over the entire longitude range of the Bay of Bengal (80 E-100 E)."}, {"section_title": "Model description", "text": "The model used in this study is the Nonhydrostatic Icosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM), which uses a global icosahedral-based grid system (Satoh et al. 2008) . NICAM was developed at the Research Institute for Global Change (RIGC) of the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC). The NICAM simulation with a horizontal grid interval of @10 km has been performed on a state-of-the-art super computer, the Earth Simulator, in Japan (Miura et al. 2007b; Iga et al. 2007 ). We use the cloud microphysics scheme with six water categories (water vapor, cloud water, rain, cloud ice, snow, and graupel), as developed by Tomita (2008a) , to represent all moist and convective processes without the use of any cumulus parameterization. Surface flux is calculated using the bulk formula developed by Louis (1979) , and the radiation scheme is the MSTRNX scheme developed by Sekiguchi and Nakajima (2008) . To enable multiple experiments to be performed, the computational cost of each run was minimized by using a stretched grid system (Tomita 2008b) , which concentrates the horizontal grid points over the target region. The finest grid interval used in this study was generally 14 km at (90 E, 5 N) over the Bay of Bengal. The validity of the simulation results obtained using a 14-km stretched grid system was evaluated by experiments performed using a 14-km globally uniform grid system and a 7-km stretched grid system, as briefly outlined in section 4.\nThe initial conditions of atmospheric variables were given from two operational analysis datasets: the Grid Point Value (GPV) dataset provided by JMA and Final Operational Global Analysis data of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP).

Figure 1 shows the track of Nargis (black curve) and sea level pressure (SLP; shading) at 1200 UTC on 2 May 2008. Before the genesis of Nargis, a weak precursor disturbance with a wind speed of only @9 ms \u00c01 was first observed over the Bay of Bengal at 1200 UTC on 25 April. Cyclone Nargis was generated over the western Bay of Bengal at 1800 UTC on 27 April with a maximum sustained wind speed of 17 ms \u00c01 . After cyclogenesis, Nargis moved eastward over the Bay of Bengal, making a landfall over Myanmar on 2 May, resulting in a catastrophic disaster. The cyclone continued to move northeastward, finally decaying over land at 0000 UTC on 4 May. Figure 2 shows daily satellite IR imagery during the life cycle of Nargis. On 27 April (Fig. 2a) , the cloud system of Nargis was observed at around "}, {"section_title": "Large-scale environmental field", "text": "Modulation of the environmental field related to Nargis's genesis is clearly observed in a time series of filtered horizontal wind at 850 hPa (Fig. 3) . Before 20 April (Figs. 3a, b) , the axis of westerly flow was located near the equator, while the easterly flow dominated between 10 N and 15 N over the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. At around 22 April (Fig. 3c) , 5 days prior to the genesis of Nargis, the axis of westerly flow started to shift northward, and the areas of easterly flow over the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea weakened. The axis of westerly flow continued to shift northward from 24 April to 6 May (Figs. 3d-j). During this period, Nargis formed at 5-10 north of the axis of the large-scale westerly flow. Even after Nargis decayed on 4 May, the westerly flow was sustained over the Bay of Bengal (Figs. 3j-l). Thus, the large-scale zonal flow over the Bay of Bengal changed from easterly (prior to Nargis formation) to westerly (after Nargis formation). Note that, the horizontal scale of zonal wind modulation was larger than that of Nargis itself, and the time scale was longer than that of Nargis's life cycle.\nTo examine the modulation of other environmental variables associated with northward movement of the westerly axis, Fig. 4 shows a latitudetime Hovm\u00f6 ller diagram of zonally averaged variables over the Bay of Bengal (80 E-100 E) from 1 April to 15 June 2008. In the zonal wind field at 850 hPa (Fig. 4a) , the easterly flow was sustained between 10 N and 15 N before the genesis of Nargis (black circle at 12 N on 27 April), whereas the westerly flow was dominant after this date. This seasonal-time-scale transition of the zonal wind appears to represent onset of the summer monsoon over the Bay of Bengal. The northward movement of the westerly axis from the equator to @10 N, associated with the zonal wind change over the Bay of Bengal, occurred over a period of @15 days from 20 April to 5 May. The characteristics of monsoon transition over the Bay of Bengal were also observed as a reversal in the sign of MTG in - the upper troposphere (200-500 hPa) over the Bay of Bengal around this period (Fig. 4b) . Before late April, MTG was negative over the since the troposphere is typically colder at higher latitudes. During early May, however, the sign of MTG changed to positive, which is a unique characteristic of the ASM region that arises due to summertime heating of the Asian continent to the north of the Bay of Bengal. These transitions in lower-tropospheric zonal wind and upper-tropospheric MTG are consistent with the climatological characteristics of ASM onset over the Bay of Bengal, as described by Mao and Wu (2007) . The seasonal transition of high SST (>29.5 ) was observed from April to early May (Fig. 4c) .\nThe GP index and its four factors provide information on the environmental field favorable for tropical cyclogenesis (Figs. 4d-h ). Modulation of the GP was apparently associated with a northward shift of the westerly flow since the area of maximum GP was located around 8 N before mid-April but shifted northward from late April to early May. Nargis was generated in this northward moving area of high GP. Although the area of high GP was sustained at around 20 N, even after midMay, the ocean area at this latitude is located near the region where the Bay of Bengal narrows northward, which appears to be too restricted for tropical cyclogenesis. We emphasize again that modulation of high GP was observed both before and after Nargis formation, demonstrating that the modulation did not result from Nargis itself. During the northward shift of the maximum GP, certain factors were modulated, and the contributed to the development of the favorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis. The absolute vorticity at 850 hPa was slightly higher during the period of high GP than during the other periods between 5 N and 20 N (Fig. 4e) . Since the GP index proposed by Emanuel and Nolan (2004) considers the absolute vorticity, the contribution of relative vorticity is minor due to the dominance of planetary vorticity (this point is discussed in section 5). The signal of a weak vertical shear (Fig. 4f) clearly contributed to the northward shift of the area of high GP. A weak vertical shear is necessary for tropical cyclogenesis because a strong shear acts to disrupt the TC structure. Between 10 N and 20 N, the potential intensity was large before cyclogenesis, whereas it reduced after cyclogenesis (Fig. 4g) ; in contrast, the relative humidity at 600 hPa showed the opposite pattern (Fig. 4h) . Thus, the northward shift of the area of high GP was well explained by the increased absolute vorticity and reduced vertical shear, as well as being partly attributed to the modulation of potential intensity and relative humidity.\nBecause Nargis was generated earlier than climatological TCs over the Bay of Bengal, it is expected that the northward shift of the maximum westerly wind and GP also occurred earlier than the climatology. Figures 5a-d show the climatology and the anomaly in 2008 of the environmental transition of zonal wind and GP. The climatological fields show the slow northward shifts of the westerly wind maximum (Fig. 5a ) and GP maximum (Fig. 5b) (Fig. 4d) appears to have resulted from the superposition of a climatological seasonal transition (Fig. 5b ) and intraseasonal oscillation with a time scale of @40 days (Fig. 5f )."}, {"section_title": "Simulation results", "text": "Here, the predictability of Nargis's genesis is examined using NICAM to focus on the following questions: (1) Is the model able to predict the cyclogenesis period over the Bay of Bengal during the large-scale modulation in late April 2008? (2) Is the model able to predict the precise location of the genesis of Nargis? (3) To what degree is the predictability of cyclogenesis sensitive to initial conditions and SST? The following subsection considers to what degree simulation results are sensitive to the experimental designs, including the datasets used for initial conditions and the setting of the numerical model.\nIn the simulation, the locations of the TC center were taken as the SLP minimum, and wind speeds within the TC were calculated from the maximum of the axisymmetric component around the TC center. As in observations, tropical cyclogenesis in the simulation was defined as a wind speed of 17 ms \u00c01 . Figure 6 shows cyclone tracks simulated in the experiments using di\u00a4erent initial datasets and grid systems started from initial conditions at 1200 UTC on 25 April 2008, 2 days prior to the genesis of Nargis. Simulated tracks using a 14-km stretched grid system with the JMA and NCEP initial datasets are shown in Figs. 6a and 6d , respectively. In both experiments, a cyclone was generated over the Bay of Bengal; however, the simulated tracks were sensitive to the initial datasets and di\u00a4erent from that observed. The JMA initial dataset generated a cyclone over the eastern Bay of Bengal, whereas the NCEP initial dataset generated a cyclone over the western Bay of Bengal. Although the simulated location of cyclogenesis obtained us- ing the NCEP initial dataset was close to that observed, the subsequent northward movement of the cyclone di\u00a4ered from the observed eastward movement of Nargis (Fig. 1) . It should be noted that a weak tropical disturbance observed in the besttrack data at the initial time (Fig. 1) does not appear to control the simulated location of cyclogenesis, partly because the signal of disturbance was too weak to be su\u2030ciently reflected in the initial datasets and partly because a weak disturbance is unable to develop via self-sustaining mechanisms (Zehr 1992) ."}, {"section_title": "Overview", "text": "The sensitivity of the simulated track to model resolution was assessed by comparing the experiments performed using a 14-km stretched grid (Figs. 6a, d ) with those obtained using a 7-km stretched grid (Figs. 6b, e) . In the experiments using the JMA initial dataset (Figs. 6a, b) , both the 14-and 7-km grid experiments simulated cyclogenesis over the eastern Bay of Bengal. In the experiments using the NCEP initial dataset (Figs. 6d, e) , both experiments simulated cyclogenesis over the western Bay of Bengal. Thus, the qualitative characteristic of the simulated cyclone track was less sensitive to model resolution than to the initial dataset although there is a minor quantitative di\u00a4erence between the tracks predicted using di\u00a4erent model resolutions. To assess whether the coarse grid interval outside of the Bay of Bengal in the stretched grid system a\u00a4ected the simulation results, a simulation was performed using a uniform grid system, in which the horizontal grid interval was 14 km all over the globe. The uniform grid system simulated cyclogenesis over the eastern Bay of Bengal when using the JMA initial dataset (Fig. 6c ) and was consistent with the results obtained using the stretched grid system (Fig. 6a) . Thus, the use of the stretched grid system did not result in a significant modification of the result, at least in the present experiment with 8-day time integration. In summary, the simulated cyclone track was more sensitive to the initial dataset than to the model resolution and to the choice between the stretched or uniform grid system. To examine in greater detail the sensitivity of the simulation results to the initial condition, the 14-km stretched grid system was used to perform a number of experiments. The results of additional experiments using the 14-km uniform grid system are presented in Taniguchi et al. (2010) .\nFigures 7 and 8 show the simulation results obtained using the JMA and NCEP datasets, respectively, for various initial times. In the experiments Fig. 6 .

The contours, shading, circles, and digits are as described in Fig. 1 .\nfor an initial time of 1200 UTC on 24 April, both the JMA and NCEP datasets resulted in the formation of two cyclones: one over the western Bay of Bengal and another over the eastern Bay of Bengal (Figs. 7a, 8a ). This result indicates favorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis over a large area of the Bay of Bengal. For initial times between 0000 UTC on 25 April and 0000 UTC on 26 April, the experiment performed using the JMA initial dataset generated a TC over the eastern Bay of Bengal (Figs. 7b-d) , whereas the experiments performed using the NCEP initial dataset generated a TC over the western Bay of Bengal (Figs. 8b-d) . After 1200 UTC on 26 April, the simulated cyclone tracks in some of the experiments are similar to those observed (Figs. 7f, 8e-f), including the cyclogenesis over the western/middle Bay of Bengal, eastward movement, and landfall over Myanmar.\nIn these experiments with an initial time between 1200 UTC on 24 April and 0000 UTC on 27 April, the most important result is that all the experiments simulated cyclogenesis over the Bay of Bengal, although the location of cyclogenesis was sensitive to the initial conditions. It should be noted that cyclogenesis was simulated in experiments using an initial time prior to 0000 UTC on 25 April, when not even a tropical disturbance was observed in the best-track data. In the following subsection, we examine whether the NICAM model can simulate a high probability of tropical cyclogenesis only in late April during the ASM onset season in 2008 as actually observed. Given that the simulated cyclone track in the experiment performed using the NCEP initial dataset for 1200 UTC on 26 April was most similar to that observed, the cloud patterns and horizontal wind in this experiment are shown in Figs. 9, 10, respectively. The cloud pattern obtained from the simulated outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) shows the following observed characteristics (see also Fig.  2 ): on 27 April (Fig. 9a) , a large area of cloud covered the southern half of the Bay of Bengal; from 29 to 30 April (Figs. 9c, d ), in addition to the cloud system associated with Nargis over the western Bay of Bengal, another cloud system formed over the eastern margin of the bay; on 2 May (Fig. 9f) , the cloud system of Nargis moved eastward to the area over Myanmar. The horizontal wind patterns at 1570 m above sea level (ASL) in the simulation (Figs. 10a-c) are comparable to those in the reanalysis data at 850 hPa (similar altitude of 1570 m ASL; Figs. 10d-f) ; because the simulation data was obtained over a very short period to obtain a 15-day running mean, the nonfiltered JCDAS reanaly- Fig. 7 .

To assess whether the model produced tropical cyclogenesis only during the observed period (i.e., late April in 2008), additional experiments were performed with initial times during the periods before and after Nargis formation. Experiments with 8-day integration were performed using the NCEP initial dataset for 0000 UTC during the period from 1 April to 20 May (50 days). As in the experiments described in the previous subsection, the time-dependent SST field in 2008 was prescribed from the OI-SST reanalysis, hereafter referred to as Exps. SST-2008 . Figure 11a shows the TC formations simulated in the 50 experiments with 8-day integration with latitude-time Hovm\u00f6 ller diagram of the zonal wind at 850 hPa averaged between 80 E and 100 E in JCDAS reanalysis (as in Fig. 4a) . A cluster of cyclone formations between 27 April and 3 May (with the red rectangle in the figure) shows that the model predicted the high probability of tropical cyclogenesis in late April. Among the cluster, the earliest initial time that predicted cyclogenesis was 20 April, 7 days prior to actual cyclogenesis. The lack of simulated cyclone formations in the periods before and after the period of actual Nargis formation demonstrates that the model was successful in simulating the period with a low probability of tropical cyclogenesis, consistent with observations. Thus, the model reproduced the contrast between the period with a high probability of cyclogenesis and the period with a low probability.\nIn Exps. SST-2008, the time dependent SST was prescribed using the OI-SST reanalysis for 2008. In the case that the SST field in 2008 was the dominant control on the timing of cyclogenesis, the Fig. 11b . The left-hand panel in Fig.  11b shows that the simulation result obtained for Exp. SST-CLIM was largely similar to that for Exp. SST-2008, i. e., the model simulated a high probability of cyclogenesis only for the period in late April. Therefore, the SST field for 2008 was not essential to simulate the timing of Nargis's genesis in late April of 2008. This finding demonstrates that it was possible to predict Nargis's genesis by about 1 week in advance using only an atmospheric model and climatological SST.\nSupplemental experiments showed that the prediction of Nargis's genesis by more than 1 week in advance was di\u2030cult because the northward shift of the environmental field was not reproduced at least in the simulations using a stretched grid system. It is of interest to examine the 1-2-week predictability of Nargis's genesis and the environmental field using a global uniform-grid system in a future study."}, {"section_title": "Summary of simulation results", "text": "The answers to the three questions raised at the beginning of this section are as follows: (1) The model predicted the period with a high probability of tropical cyclogenesis over the Bay of Bengal in late April 2008.

Further discussion of these results is provided in the following session."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Interpretation of environmental modulation", "text": "In section 3, it was demonstrated that Nargis was generated in a northward-shifting region of high GP during late April of 2008 (Fig. 4d) . During this period, the environmental zonal flow over the Bay of Bengal changed from easterly to westerly (Fig.  4a) , which is characteristic of the period around ASM onset (Webster et al. 1998; Mao and Wu 2007) . In addition, the upper-tropospheric MTG changed from negative to positive at this time (Fig.  4b) , which is another signal of ASM onset (Mao and Wu 2007) . Therefore, it is expected that the timing of environmental modulation associated with monsoon transition could explain the early oc- Figure 12a shows the temporal evolution of MTG for the 15 years in which tropical cyclogenesis occurred during April or May. The climatological monsoon transition is represented by increasing MTG (from negative to positive values) around the period from late April to early May. In the years 1991, 1994, 2006, and 2008 during which early tropical cyclogenesis occurred, the transition in the MTG occurred earlier than that in most other years. Therefore, the timing of the monsoon transition appears to control the timing of the period of tropical cyclogenesis. Because MTG is proportional to vertical shear of the horizontal wind by the thermal wind balance, a small MTG during the monsoon transition corresponds to a weak vertical shear, which represents a favorable environment for tropical cyclogenesis as indicated by the GP analysis. Figure 12b shows the temporal evolution of relative vorticity at 850 hPa. Again, the transition in vorticity in 1991, 1994, 2006, and 2008 occurred earlier than that in most other years although the signals are obscured by noise to some degree. The vorticity at 850 hPa is also a favorable environment for tropical cyclogenesis. Since the environmental transitions preceded the dates of tropical cyclogenesis, the former appears to be a cause of the latter, rather than a consequence.\nThe transition speed of the environmental field in 2008 appeared to be higher than that in the climatology (Figs. 4a, d, 5a, b) . The anomaly field in 2008 showed a rapid northward shift of zonal wind and GP (Figs. 5c, d ). In the data for 2008 with a 30-60-day band-path filter, this rapid northward shift was also observed as a signal of a @40-day period (Figs. 5e, f) , which resembles intraseasonal oscillation (ISO) in the ASM (Yasunari 1981; Jiang et al. 2004 ). Flatau et al. (2001) suggested that interannual variability in the timing of monsoon onset is modulated by the ISO. In fact, Kikuchi and Wang (2009) showed that the boreal summer ISO (BSISO) was observed around the period of Nargis's genesis. Tropical cyclogenesis in the southern hemisphere at around the time of Nargis (see Fig.  4d ) also appears to be related to the ISO (i.e., twin tropical cyclogenesis; Zhu et al. 2003) . Thus, it is interpreted that the environmental modulation of high GP in 2008 resulted from the superposition of seasonal transition of the ASM and BSISO. "}, {"section_title": "Validity of GP analysis", "text": "In the previous subsection, we described that the ISO modulates an environment favorable for tropical cyclogenesis. However, a boreal summer ISO with a period of 40-50 days (Murakami et al. 1984) , represents an intermediate time scale between the seasonal transition of the environmental field and the sources of tropical cyclogenesis (@10 days); the source is a disturbance (noise) that directly triggers tropical cyclogenesis, such as tropical waves (Molinari et al. 2000) and extratropical disturbances (Davis and Bosart 2004) . This time scale of the ISO may raise some debate regarding whether the ISO is an environment in which TCs are generated (Aiyyer and Molinari 2008; Camargo et al. 2009 ), or a source (Kikuchi and Wang 2009 ). There exist some di\u00a4erences between the ISO and ordinary TC sources: (1) because the temporal and spatial scales of the ISO are larger than those of the TC itself and of ordinary TC sources, the life cycle of an ISO may be associated with several tropical cyclogenesis (Murakami et al. 1984; Aiyyer and Molinari 2008) ; and (2) the ISO remains even after dissipation of a TC, whereas ordinary sources tend to disappear during cyclogenesis or to evolve into a TC. Because these di\u00a4erences are somewhat ambiguous, future studies should carefully consider which idea (an environment or a source) is more appropriate in explaining the influence of the ISO on tropical cyclogenesis. In the present study at least, the high GP of the environmental field was consistent with the genesis of Nargis in late April of 2008. A statistical study on the relation between tropical cyclogenesis and the environmental field over the Bay of Bengal will be discussed in a subsequent paper.\nAnother question to consider is whether the strong zonal wind and high GP at around the time of Nargis's genesis in 2008 (Figs. 4a, d) were a signal of the TC, rather than the cause of cyclogenesis. In any study on the relation between tropical cyclogenesis and the environmental field associated with ISO, it is important to carefully consider the influence of TC itself on the environmental field. The following points are important in this regard: (1) spatial and temporal filters were used to remove the signal of a TC in the present study, (2) the northward shift of zonal wind and GP began more than 10 days prior to the genesis of Nargis (Figs. 5e, f), and (3) a similar northward shift was observed during the monsoon onset season in 1995, even in the absence of tropical cyclogenesis (Fig.  13 )."}, {"section_title": "Structure of the simulated environmental field", "text": "In our numerical simulations, the northward shift of the westerly flow axis in the environmental field appears to be a key factor in reproducing the genesis of Nargis in late April of 2008. Figure 14 shows a latitude-time diagram of the zonal wind at 1570 m ASL averaged between 80 E and 100 E in the experiment that employed the NCEP initial dataset for 0000 UTC on 22 April, which reproduced the northward shift of the westerly flow axis and tropical cyclogenesis at 0600 UTC on 27 April (black circle in the figure). Because tropical cyclogenesis occurred around the northward-moving boundary between the westerly and easterly flows, we analyzed the composite structure of the northward moving environmental field for the period before tropical cyclogenesis (black line in the figure), which is not influenced by the dynamics of the TC itself. The composite of 17 time steps using 3 hourly outputs from 0000 UTC on 24 to 0000 UTC on 26 April was e\u00a4ective in removing the small-scale noise associated with cumulus convection. Figure 15 shows meridional-vertical cross sections of the composite variables averaged between 80 E and 100 E. Because the composite was performed along the boundary between westerly and easterly flows at 1570 m ASL, the origin of the horizontal axis is located near the zero line of the zonal wind field in the lower troposphere (Fig. 15a) . The axis of the westerly flow occurred at around \u00c08 to \u00c04 south of the origin in the lower troposphere. The vertical shear of the zonal wind is relatively weak, at around 0-2 , which is favorable for tropical cyclogenesis. Relative vorticity was large at around \u00c02 to 2 (Fig. 15b) , where the zonal wind had a negative gradient in the meridional direction. Strong convective updraft throughout the troposphere occurred at around 2 , where relative vorticity was large in the lower troposphere, particularly below 1 km ASL (Fig. 15c) . Convergence in the Ekman layer is also large at around 2 (Fig. 15d) . Gray (1975) suggested that relative vorticity in the lower troposphere is favorable for cumulus convection via the continuous importing of water vapor in the Ekman layer. This mechanism is consistent with the simulated structure with relative vorticity, convergence in the Ekman layer, and strong convective updraft, which is important for the environment of tropical cyclogenesis (Gray 1975) and also for the dynamics of BSISO (Jiang et al. 2004) . Jiang et al. (2004) suggested that vertical advection of the zonal momentum due to convection is important for the northward movement of the BSISO signal. Although the authors explained these dynamics in the vorticity field in an ideal 2.5-layer atmospheric model (Fig. 10 in their paper) , the simulated field of vorticity equation terms is too complicated to be considered in a more realistic atmospheric model. Therefore, rather than the vorticity-tendency term, the vertical advection of the zonal momentum is shown in Fig. 15e . In the lower troposphere, positive advection of zonal momentum occurred at around 0-4 on the northern side of the westerly flow axis, although the result was obscured somewhat by noise. This advection contributes to the northward movement of the phase of the westerly flow axis, which is consistent with the vorticity dynamics reported by Jiang et al. (2004) , if the meridional gradient of zonal flow and its tendency are considered.\nThus, the structure of the simulated environmental field was favorable for tropical cyclogenesis and was also consistent with the dynamics of BSISO. These results suggest that the dynamics of convection, including the Ekman layer e\u00a4ect and vertical momentum transport, should be represented by cloud-system-resolving models (Miura et al. 2007a; Oouchi et al. 2009) or by appropriate cumulus parameterization schemes in order to simulate tropical cyclogenesis around the ASM onset season. It is also inferred that the influence of relative vorticity on tropical cyclogenesis via Ekman layer dynamics (Gray 1975) should be reconsidered in the GP index using absolute vorticity (Emanuel and Nolan 2004) ."}, {"section_title": "Predictability of tropical cyclogenesis in other periods", "text": "We also investigated the predictability of tropical cyclogenesis in other years and other seasons than those in which Nargis occurred (Fig. 16 ), using NICAM with a 14-km stretched grid system and NCEP initial data (only available from July 1999). In the ASM onset season of 2002, tropical cyclogenesis was observed on 11 May during a northward shift of the environmental westerly flow (Fig. 16a ). This environmental modulation had an intraseasonal component of 3 ms \u00c01 in zonal wind (data not shown), slightly larger than that in 2008 (2 ms \u00c01 ; see Fig. 5e ). The model simulated the high probability of cyclogenesis around the actual period with a rapid transition of zonal wind. This result is similar to those obtained from the experiments for the ASM onset season in 2008, as described in section 4.2. During the ASM onset season of 2001 (Fig. 16b) , no tropical cyclogenesis was observed over the Bay of Bengal during the period of transition of zonal wind, which had an intraseasonal component of 1 ms \u00c01 in zonal wind (data not shown). However, the model produced tropical cyclogenesis around the period of transition of zonal wind, suggesting that the large-scale environment during the northward shift of westerly flow in the ASM onset season had the potential for tropical cyclogenesis.\nAround the time of the ASM withdrawal season in 2008 (Fig. 16c) , in contrast, three tropical cyclogenesis were observed during the slow transition of the monsoon from westerly to easterly. Because the TC season around the ASM withdrawal showed a gradual change compared with that around the ASM onset in 2008, the contrast between high and low probability is less clear in the simulation, although the model captured some modulation of cyclogenesis probability that appears to be a\u00a4ected by ISO. Thus, the large-scale environment around the time of ASM onset modulated more rapidly than that around the time of ASM withdrawal, which resulted in the successful simulation of a high cyclogenesis probability during late April of 2008."}, {"section_title": "Di\u00a4erences in the initial field", "text": "As is shown in Fig. 6 , the cyclone tracks in the simulation starting from 1200 UTC on 25 April differed between the two initial datasets: the JMA initial condition resulted in cyclogenesis over the eastern Bay of Bengal (hereafter referred to as Exp. J2512), whereas the NCEP initial condition resulted in cyclogenesis over the western Bay of Bengal (Exp. N2512). Several factors may explain why the di\u00a4erence in initial fields influences the subsequent tropical cyclogenesis, including initial disturbances, environmental wind field, and environmental moisture field. However, it was too complicated to precisely determine which factor resulted in the di\u00a4erence. A simple sensitivity experiment was performed in which a combination of dynamical field (horizontal wind and temperature) and moist field (water vapor) in the initial datasets was exchanged between Exps. J2512 and N2512: a combination of the JMA (NCEP) dynamical field and NCEP (JMA) moist field was given as the initial condition in Exp. JdNm (NdJm). Figure 17 shows the cyclone tracks simulated in Exps. JdNm and NdJm. The cyclone track in Exp. JdNm is similar to that in Exp. J2512, and the track in Exp. NdJm is similar to that in Exp. N2512. Therefore, the di\u00a4erence in the dynamical field between JMA and NCEP initial data had a greater influence on the simulation result than did the moist field. This result suggests that the assimilation of the more accurate observation of dynamical field into the initial dataset would result in more accurate prediction of the location of tropical cyclogenesis."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "The large-scale environment and numerical predictability were investigated for the genesis of TC Nargis over the Bay of Bengal in late April of 2008. A northward shift of high GP and westerly flow was observed from mid-April to early May. This northward shift of the environmental field was attributed to the seasonal transition of ASM and an anomaly with an intraseasonal time scale of @40 days, which appears to be a BSISO event. The climatologically early transition of ASM in 2008 is consistent with the genesis of Nargis in April, which is earlier than the climatological tropical cyclogenesis. On the basis of the analysis of GP, the environmental modulation favorable for Nargis's genesis is attributed to reduced vertical shear and increased lower-tropospheric vorticity. The influence of the seasonal transition of ASM and the BSISO on GP, using climatological dataset, is to be reported in a subsequent paper.\nThe numerical model successfully reproduced the high probability of tropical cyclogenesis during the observed period in late April 2008. The period of high probability appears to be related to the northward shift of the area of high GP associated with the seasonal transition of ASM and the BSISO. The anomaly of SST in 2008 had little influence on the simulated probability of tropical cyclogenesis; consequently, an atmospheric model, even one without ocean feedback, appears to have the potential to predict the probability of tropical cyclogenesis during the environmental modulation over the Bay of Bengal at around the time of ASM onsets. The use of cloud-system resolving model appears to be advantageous in simulating BSISO (Oouchi et al. 2009 ), possibly due to the representation of mesoscale dynamics, including the Ekman layer e\u00a4ect and vertical momentum transport in BSISO (Jiang et al. 2004) . The large-scale environment was insu\u2030cient to control the location of cyclogenesis. A more precise initial dataset, particularly in terms of dynamical fields, is required to simulate the detailed life cycle of a TC."}]
