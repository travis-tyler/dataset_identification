"}, {"section_title": "Pecentage of Producers by Seed Variety in 2013", "text": "From 2006 to 2013, producers have increased their use of HT seeds, hybrid seeds, or a combination of Hybrid+HT seeds while decreasing their usage of conventional seed. There are several reasons for these decisions, two of which are increased weed control and higher yields."}, {"section_title": "Management Practices of Rice Producers", "text": "Weeds can develop resistance to herbicides, but certain field practices can slow the development of resistance. \u2022 Crop rotations can slow resistance -in both 2006 and 2013, two-thirds of the acres planted to herbicide tolerant varieties were rotated into rice from other crops planted the previous year. \u2022 Resistant weed varieties can also be managed by plowing crop residues, burning residues, and plowing, burning, or chopping at the edges of fields; use of each of those practices increased-among farmers planting herbicide tolerant rice-between 2006 and 2013.
