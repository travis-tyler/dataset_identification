[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In late December 2019, a number cases of pneumonia infection were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It was officially named Coronavirus disease by the World Health Organization (WHO) and has since spread to 210 countries around the world [1, 2] . The pathogen causing the outbreak of disease was identified as a novel Coronavirus (termed SARS-CoV-2), belonging to the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, all of which are enveloped, non-segmented positive-sense RNA viruses [3, 4] . According to the WHO and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the current gold standard for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is based on reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).\nHowever, RT-qPCR is reported to have issue of false negative rates for pharyngeal swab samples [5] and there were 3% of patients who had negative RT-qPCR test results at initial presentation while chest CT checks indicated typical symptoms of viral pneumonia [6] . In order to identify and hospitalize COVID-19 patients in time, more sensitive and accurate tests are required.\nDigital PCR (dPCR) is a technology which partitions nucleic acid molecules into a large number of small reactions and acquires amplification data for each partition at the endpoint based on the intensity of fluorescence [7] [8] [9] . Quantification is performed by applying Poisson statistics to the proportion of the negative partitions. dPCR can offer greater precision than qPCR and is far simpler to use for copy number quantification due the binary nature in which the partitions are counted as positive or negative. Additionally, dPCR is more tolerant of PCR inhibition compared with qPCR due to partitioning and because it is an end-point PCR measurement and consequently less dependent on high PCR efficiency [10, 11] .\nIn this study, we established one step RT-dPCR method for detection of open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) \uff0c nucleocapsid protein (N) and envelope protein (E) gene of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, we compared RT-qPCR and RT-dPCR on 196 clinical samples and found RT-dPCR can significantly improve the sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

The genome sequence of 2019-nCoV (GenBank No. NC_045512) were download from NCBI. Sequences containing ORF1ab (13201-15600), E (25381-26520), and N (28261-29820) were used to order synthetic genes from BGI (Beijing, China). All the detail information was in the supplemental information."}, {"section_title": "One step reverse transcription dPCR and RT-qPCR", "text": "Three assays for gene targets of N,ORF1ab and E of the SARS-CoV-2 were optimized on QX200 digital PCR platform [12, 13] . Three different commercial RT-qPCR kits (H&R from Shanghai Huirui Biotechnology Co., Ltd, BioGerm from Shanghai BioGerm Medical Biotechnology and Daan from Daan Gene Co., Ltd) were used for the detection. The detail of RT-dPCR and RT-qPCR was in the supplemental information.\nJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f"}, {"section_title": "Limit of blank (LoB) and detection (LoD) of RT-dPCR", "text": "To establish the limit of blank (LoB) [14] , 60 blank measurements were obtained from 3 blank samples on three days. 70 to 76 measurements from 4-5 samples with low concentration (1 to 3 cp/reaction) were used to determine the limit of detection (LoD) according to the CLSI guideline of EP17-A [15] ."}, {"section_title": "Dynamic range of the RT-dPCR assay", "text": "The linear range was investigated by varying the mean copy number per droplet, denoted as \u03bb [16] . The precision or relative error of RT-dPCR is related to \u03bb because of RT-dPCR relies on the Poisson statistics to account for droplets with multiple molecules [17] . The upper limit of the linearity was 7.8 copies/partition tested by the N gene assay. To determine the lower limit of all three assays, serial dilutions of each RNA transcript in a human total RNA background were prepared (Table S1 ). The measured targets matched the anticipated values in each tested interval. A good linearity (0.93<slope<1.02, R 2 \u2265 0.9997) between the measured RNA target and the prepared value was observed over the range from approximately 10 4 to 10 0 copies/reaction (Fig. 2 ). Reactions containing a mean of 60 E, 66 N or 11 ORF1ab copies fulfilled the criterion for an LoQ with a CV lower than 25%."}, {"section_title": "Establishment of LoB and LoD for RT-dPCR assay", "text": "Sixty blank measurements obtained from 3 blank samples were analyzed to determine the LoB. As the distribution of the 60 blank measurements is skewed (Fig.   S1 ), the LoB was estimated nonparametrically as the 95th percentile of the measurements. The 15 highest blank values for each target are displayed in Table S2 .\nThe 95th percentile corresponds to the 57.5 ordered observation (=60*(0.95/60+0.5)) [15] . Linear interpolation between the 57th and 58th observation yields a LoB J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f estimate of 1.6, 1.6, and 0.8 copies/reaction for E, ORF1ab and N, respectively.\nFor determining the LoD of ORF1ab gene assay, 76 measurements were performed on five samples in 3 different runs on three different days to ensure the total assay variation is reflected. The distribution of the 76 measurement results from low concentration samples is not Gaussian (Fig. S2A ) and so that nonparametric statistics was used according to the guideline of EP17-A [15] . Consequently, the LoD is determined to be 2 copies/reaction, the lowest level material where the \u03b2-percentile is 5 %.\nTo determine the LoD of N and E assay, 83 measurements of E assay on 5 samples and 71 measurements of N assay on 4 samples were performed in 4 different runs. Similar to ORF1ab gene, the distribution of the 71 measurements for N gene and 83 measurements are not Gaussian ( Fig. S2B and S2C ), and so that nonparametric statistics was used. Consequently, the LoD is determined to be 2 copies/ reaction."}, {"section_title": "The LoD of the two RT-qPCR kits (Daan gene and BioGerm) used in this study", "text": "were reported in a previous study [18] . The data indicates LoD of the proposed RT-dPCR is 5 times and 10 times higher than the Daan and BioGerm kit, respectively."}, {"section_title": "Specificity testing", "text": "The Specificity of the assays for ORF1ab and E gene has been tested in a previous report [13] . To further validate the specificity of all assays, Influenza virus and other human coronavirus were collected.

All tests returned negative results (Table S3 ). significantly improved from 28.2% to 87.4% for the 103 patients ( Fig. 3A and 3B) ."}, {"section_title": "Comparison between RT-qPCR and RT-dPCR on febrile suspected patients", "text": "Furthermore, the 61 samples (either negative or equivocal tested by RT-qPCR but positive by RT-dPCR, Table S4 ) were reported with averaged viral load of 31, 25 and 26 copies/reaction for ORF1ab, N and E, respectively. Those 29 positive samples by RT-qPCR showed a relatively high viral load with an average of 998, 1099 and 2594 copies/reaction for ORF1ab, N and E, respectively."}, {"section_title": "Detection of SARS-CoV-2 for close contacts", "text": "77 specimens were collected from contacts and close contacts. 48 specimens from contacts were reported negative based RT-qPCR test by BJCDC on Feb 6 and were confirmed by RT-dPCR on Feb 7 in Table S5 . According to a follow-up survey, all of them were in good health and isolation was lifted after 14 days. 29 specimens (Table S6 and indicates RT-dPCR is more sensitive and suitable for low virus load specimens from the patients under isolation and observation without clinical symptoms, which is in agreement with the very recent online report [19] ."}, {"section_title": "Detection of SARS-CoV-2 for convalescent", "text": "16 pharyngeal swabs were collected from convalescent patients ( Table 1) . 12 positive, 3 equivocal and 1 negative were reported by qPCR. However, all of these 16 patients are diagnosed to be positive by RT-dPCR, indicating that all of them still need to be observed in hospital."}, {"section_title": "Correlation between Ct value and copy number", "text": "The correlation between the Ct value and copy number/reaction for both ORF1ab and N of all specimens was analyzed in Fig. 4A . Ct value of RT-PCR was highly correlated with the log copy number determined by RT-dPCR (ORF1ab, R 2 =0.7078; N, R 2 =0.7106). The RT-dPCR assay for ORF1ab was correlated well with N assay.\nThe viral load was distributed in the range of 2~100 and 2~15 copy number/reaction for the specimens with the single gene positive and negative, respectively, detected by RT-qPCR (Fig. 4B ). This very low viral load could explain why these specimens were single gene positive or negative reported by RT-qPCR.\nRT-qPCR, as the standard method of diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2, plays an important role in this outbreak, though a low positive rate has been reported [5] . A number of factors could affect RT-PCR testing results including sample collection and transportation, RNA extraction and storage, and proper performance of the kit [20] .\nMore recently, more than 145 RT-qPCR kits have been developed by the in vitro diagnostic manufactures (IVDs) in China [21] . Among the RT-qPCR kits, those with J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f low sensitivity would cause high false negative rate or high equivocal rate. For the equivocal results it is necessary to conduct a retest and this would improve the positive rate of RT-qPCR. However, in the clinical practice under the current situation, it is impossible to do a same day retest due to the daily burden of thousands of incoming samples. The testing laboratory should initially report a result based on a single test, while secondary sampling for a later retest does not need to be sent to the same laboratory. Therefore, availability of a highly sensitive and accurate confirmatory method is of particular importance for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in this outbreak.\nCurrently, besides RT-qPCR, other methods such as next generation sequencing (NGS) and immunological detection of IgM and IgG could be used as confirmatory methods for diagnosis of COVID-19 according to the latest guideline of Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonitis Caused by SARS-CoV-2 (trial seventh version) published by National Health Commission [22] . This would decrease the false negative rate by applying multiple methods. However, nucleic acid testing is still considered the gold standard as this is the most direct way to detect the presence of the virus. Thus, digital PCR method could be a powerful method because it can significantly improve the sensitivity for pharyngeal swab samples of the suspect patients. The overall sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of RT-qPCR in our study were 36% and 52% (Table S8) Disease Information System (NIDIS). The RT-qPCR sensitivity is in agreement with the previous report for the pharyngeal swab samples [5] . However, both sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of RT-dPCR dramatically increased to 91 % and 93%, respectively. This is very meaningful as pharyngeal swab is much easier to sampling.\nThus RT-dPCR is very sensitive for the very low viral load in suspected patients and the asymptomatic close contacts.\nFurthermore, it is suitable for monitoring the change of the virus load in the convalescent patients. An additional advantage of quantification of SARS-CoV-2 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f copy number by RT-dPCR is that comparisons can be conducted between different dates and different laboratories as absolute quantitation of targets by RT-dPCR provides high concordance between sites, runs and operators [14, 23, 24] . However, it is not possible to compare Ct values on different runs or different machines. Thus, RT-dPCR is an ideal method to for measuring the change of virus load in the convalescent patients."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This work demonstrates that RT-dPCR significantly improves accuracy and reduces the false negative rate of diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2 in pharyngeal swab specimens, which is more convenient and simpler to sampling. Furthermore, dPCR is more sensitive and suitable for low virus load specimens from the patients under isolation and observation who may not be exhibiting clinical symptoms. Finally, RT-dPCR could be used to quantitative monitoring the convalescents to evaluate disease progression. "}]
