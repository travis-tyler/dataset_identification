[{"section_title": "", "text": "Phylogenetic analysis performed with Pangolin v1.14 (6) assigned strain Siena-1/2020 to the B1.1 lineage, which is associated with the Italian SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and includes isolates circulating in Europe (Fig. 1) . Compared to the reference genome Wuhan Hu-1, Siena-1/2020 harbors 5 single nucleotide changes (at positions 241, 3037, 14408, 19839, and 23403) and mutations of 3 consecutive nucleotides (GGG\u00a1AAC) at position 28881. Among the 5 single nucleotide changes, the one at position 23403 causes a change in the predicted amino acid sequence of the spike (S) protein (D614G), which is now the most common variant worldwide (7) .\nData availability. The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 Siena-1/2020 has been deposited in GenBank under the accession no. MT531537. The version described in this paper is the second version. The raw Nanopore reads were deposited in the Sequence Read Archive under BioProject accession no. PRJNA658490 with accession no. SRX8982904 (direct RNA sequencing) and SRX8982905 (amplicon sequencing)."}]
