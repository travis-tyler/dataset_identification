[{"section_title": "I. Introduction", "text": "The steady rise in women's labor market participation has been one of the most noteworthy economic and social transformations of the past several decades. Approximately 59 percent of women currently participate in the paid labor force, compared to 43 percent in 1970. In contrast, the fraction of men in the labor force slipped from 81 to 71 percent over the same period (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012). A key ingredient of the overall growth in female employment has been the increased labor force attachment of unmarried women with young children. Over the past three decades, the participation rate of never-married mothers with preschool-aged children increased from 44 to 68 percent, a level now exceeding their married counterparts (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012). The phenomenal employment growth among single mothers raises questions about the implications of early maternal work for the short-and long-run development of low-income children. This issue took center stage in the debate over the U.S.'s 1996 welfare reform law, formally called the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA). Arguably the most contentious element of the PRWORA was the creation of work requirements with which adults must comply to be eligible for cash assistance. The rules stipulate that adults must be engaged in an acceptable work activity{commonly defined as participation in paid workforce{at least 30 hours per week. In addition, states have the option to levy a sanction equal to all or part of the welfare benefit on those who fail to comply with the work requirements. Economic theory offers ambiguous predictions about the impact of the PRWORA's work requirements on child well-being. The most obvious mechanism for a positive effect is through an increase in family income, which can be used to purchase household technologies that enhance child health and development. In addition, some mothers may obtain or improve the family's health insurance coverage through an employer-provided plan. Attachment to the workforce can also benefit mothers' mental health and sense of personal control, which in turn may lead to increased household stability and higher-quality parenting. On the other hand, it is possible that the income available to invest in child development remains flat or even declines, given that welfare benefits are aggressively phased-out and that mothers might divert resources away from children in order to cover workrelated expenses (e.g., clothing, transportation, and child care). Furthermore, work requirements may decrease the quantity and quality of maternal time investments in children, while simultaneously increasing children's exposure to lower-quality non-maternal care. Finally, household stability could be negatively affected if the work mandates are not flexible enough to accommodate mothers with little work experience and skills as well as substance abuse or mental health issues. Although the PRWORA's work requirements provide an interesting laboratory for studying the implications of early maternal work, identifying credible causal effects is challenging because of the complexity of measuring the work requirement rules. In particular, the PRWORA is a bundle of policy reforms{all of which were implemented contemporaneously{making it difficult to construct a measure of work requirements that is empirically untethered from other features of the legislation. This problem is exacerbated by the mid-1990's implementation of other labor market reforms, including expansions to the Earned Income Tax Credit and child care subsidies. Such difficulties provide one explanation for why only a small number of studies examine the developmental implications of welfare reform generally or work requirements specifically (Haider et al., 2003;Kaestner & Lee, 2005;Washbrook et al., 2011). In light of these challenges, it may be tempting to draw inferences about the impact of work requirements from the large literature studying the direct relationship between early maternal employment and child development. This research generally finds negative effects of maternal employment during the child's first year of life, with neutral or even positive effects when work begins during the second or third year of life (Bernal, 2008;Brooks-Gunn et al., 2002;James-Burdumy, 2005;Ruhm, 2004;Waldfogel et al., 2002). Many of these studies, however, analyze samples of economically diverse families, and therefore may not be appropriate for drawing conclusions about the population of families at-risk of receiving welfare. In addition, these studies must surmount a complex identification issue: mothers who decide to work early in a child's life are likely to be different from those who do not in ways that are difficult to fully capture. If these unobserved maternal differences are correlated with child well-being, the estimated effect of early maternal work may be spurious. To date, only a handful of studies attempt to overcome this omitted variables problem, most frequently by controlling for a rich set of observable family characteristics (e.g., Ruhm, 2004) or through a fixed effects estimator (e.g., Chase-Lansdale et al., 2003;James-Burdumy, 2005;Waldfogel et al., 2002). The use of instrumental variables is even less common (e.g., Bernal & Keane, 2011;Morrill, 2011), largely because of difficulties finding credible instruments for maternal employment. This paper examines the short-run impact of early maternal employment on the cognitive development of low-income children by exploiting an important feature of states' welfare work requirements. In particular, I use age-of-youngest-child exemptions (AYCEs) from the work require-ments as a source of plausibly exogenous variation in first-year maternal employment. The PRWORA authorized states to exempt adult welfare recipients from the work requirements until the youngest child reaches a certain age. This produced substantial variation in the amount of time that mothers can remain home with a newborn child, ranging from zero months in four states to 24 months in three states as of the early-2000s. In addition, many states provide mothers with different AYCE time allotments depending on the birth-order of the child. A comparatively generous exemption is provided after a woman's first child, while shorter exemptions are given after higher-order births. I use this within-and between-state variation to calculate the number of months remaining in mothers' work requirement exemption at various points throughout children's first year of life. This instrumental variable (IV) therefore generates the local average treatment effect (LATE) of workrequirement-induced increases in early maternal employment. Thus, the IV estimates in this paper are particularly important from a policy perspective. I apply states' AYCE policies to infants and their mothers in the Birth Cohort of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-B), a large nationally representative cohort study of children born in 2001. I rely on the 9-month survey, in which children were administered a cognitive ability test and mothers provided comprehensive information about the family. An advantage of the ECLS-B is that it allows researchers to construct a detailed history of maternal labor supply since the focal child's birth. I use this information to examine two measures of early maternal employment: a binary indicator for any employment since childbirth and the cumulative number of months employed. In addition, the ECLS-B contains multiple high-quality measures of children's cognitive and behavioral development, and it provides restricted-use access to rich birth certificate information. This file identifies children's state of birth and birth-order, which are needed to construct the IV. The birth certificate file also contains a number of pre-treatment child and family characteristics that are used as covariates in the child production function. The paper's main results are summarized as follows. I first show that states' AYCE time allotments are highly correlated with the employment decisions of disadvantaged mothers. Estimates from the first-stage equation indicate that reductions in mothers' AYCE allotment increase the likelihood of engaging in any work since childbirth (F=31.0) as well as the cumulative number of months employed (F=24.5). In addition, the AYCE instrument passes a number of falsification and exogeneity tests: it is uncorrelated with the work decisions of mothers ineligible for welfare, and it is uncorrelated with a variety of pre-treatment characteristics, including pre-birth maternal employ-ment. OLS estimates from the child ability production function suggest that children of working mothers score higher on the 9-month Bayley Short Form-Research Edition (BSF-R) test than their counterparts whose mothers do not work. However, the IV results imply that the OLS estimates are severely biased upward. When states' AYCE policies are used to instrument for early maternal work, I find that test scores are lower among children of working mothers. For example, each month of employment in the first year of life is estimated to reduce cognitive ability test scores by 0.08 standard deviations. A supplementary analysis of mechanisms finds that working mothers experience an increase in depressive symptoms, are less likely to breast-feed and read to their children, and experience behavioral complications with the child. In addition, such children are exposed to non-parental child care arrangements at a younger age, and they spend more time in these settings throughout the first year of life. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section II provides background information on states' AYCE policies. Section III summarizes the relevant literature. Section IV introduces the ECLS-B survey and analysis sample, while Section V describes the identification strategy. The OLS and IV results are presented in Section VI, while Section VII explores mechanisms. Finally, Section VIII concludes."}, {"section_title": "II. Background on Age-of-Youngest-Child Exemptions", "text": "With the passage of the 1996 PRWORA, all states now require adult welfare recipients to participate in an acceptable work activity for at least 30 hours per week within 24 months of receiving assistance. 1 States are given the authority to grant exemptions from the work requirements for a myriad of reasons. One such exemption, referred to as an age-of-youngest-child exemption (AYCE), allows mothers to remain home in order to provide care for an infant or toddler. 2 Prior to the PRWORA, most states set the AYCE at 36 months, meaning that mothers could receive cash assistance without fulfilling a work requirement until the youngest child reached 36 months of age. However, the 1996 legislation stipulates that states may, but are not required to, exempt mothers with young children from participating in work-related activities. Not surprisingly, the law's flexibility had the effect of both reducing the average AYCE allotment and increasing the variation in AYCEs across states. These changes imply that over time a growing number of new mothers have been ex-posed to states' work requirements, and that considerable cross-state variation now exists in the amount of time a mother is allowed to remain home with a newborn. Table 1 summarizes the key features of states' AYCE provisions for 2001, the relevant year for the current analysis (Urban Institute, 2001). Whereas a 36-month AYCE was the norm prior to welfare reform, no state provided such a generous allotment five years after reform. The baseline AYCE ranges from zero months in (e.g., Arizona) to 24 months (e.g., Massachusetts). Four states provided new mothers with no AYCE, 19 states provided them with an AYCE of less than 12 months, and 28 states granted an AYCE of 12 or more months. In addition to setting the amount of time allotted under an AYCE, states have the authority to establish the characteristics of families to which these allotments apply. As shown in Table 1, 13 states established policies in which the child's birth-order determines the AYCE. In particular, a comparatively generous allotment was provided to women having their first child, while mothers' higher-order births were given a substantially smaller allotment. The most common approach{taken in 12 of the 13 states adopting birth-order-based AYCEs{was to set the AYCE at 12 months for the first children and zero months for each subsequent child. The only state to deviate from this allotment was West Virginia, which provided a six month AYCE to all higher-order births. Still another strategy, utilized in three states, was to provide a lifetime allotment of exempt time that can be used for multiple children. In each case, however, the state specified the maximum number of months that may be allocated to each newborn. Washington provided mothers with a lifetime AYCE of 12 months, stipulating that no more than four months could be expended on a single child. Such a policy implies that the AYCE in Washington was zero months starting with the fourth child. Oklahoma and Wyoming also provided a 12-month lifetime AYCE, but these states granted a maximum three month exemption up and including the fourth child. Finally, one state{South Caro-lina{used characteristics like mothers' age and educational attainment to establish different AYCE allotments. Here, the baseline AYCE allotment of 12 months applied only to mothers ages 26 and older who have at least a high school degree; mothers not meeting these criteria were given zero months of exempt time. 3 3 Given the complexity of states' AYCE provisions, a reasonable question is whether state TANF administrators are aware of the rules, understand them, and enforce them. For his own paper on AYCEs, Pingle (2003) contacted TANF administrators in 16 states to inquire about these issues. According to Pingle, state officials indicated that awareness and enforcement of AYCEs are widespread. In addition, the administrators themselves knew immediately the length of the current AYCE, and explained that it is easily applied by caseworkers and other staff to exempt mothers from the work requirements. The structure of states' AYCEs{a specified period during which mothers are able to remain home with a newborn while receiving cash assistance{naturally lends itself to comparisons with various parental leave schemes (Hill, 2012). For example, the U.S.'s Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides 12 weeks of parental leave to individuals who worked at least 1,250 hours in the previous year. Although both policies increase the amount of maternal care in the first few months of a child's life, there are several important differences. The FMLA affords three months of unpaid leave, whereas AYCEs offer a form of paid time-off that, in most states, lasts much longer than three months. 4 Therefore, the FMLA is predicted to reduce family income during the leave period, while AYCEs effectively replace wage with non-wage income, although the average replacement rate is likely far below 100 percent. 5 In addition, whereas the FMLA provides job-protected leave, no such guarantee exists in states' AYCEs. Indeed, the structure of AYCEs creates an incentive for women to leave a job and apply for welfare around the time of childbirth. Such mothers must subsequently engage in a job search at or near the end of the exempt time in order to maintain eligibility for cash assistance. The lack of job protection could therefore decrease maternal time with children and disrupt family routines toward the end of the exempt period."}, {"section_title": "III. Existing Literature", "text": "Multiple streams of research are relevant to the current study. First, there is an extensive literature studying the direct relationship between early maternal employment and child well-being. This work generally finds that full-time maternal employment in the first few years of a child's life leads to small, negative effects on early and later cognitive and behavioral development (Bernal, 2008;Brooks-Gunn et al., 2002;James-Burdumy, 2005;Ruhm, 2004;Waldfogel et al., 2002), increases in a number of adverse health outcomes (Morrill, 2011), and increases in obesity rates (Anderson et al., 2003). Much of this work analyzes samples of economically diverse children, who are less relevant to the current study's focus on the disadvantaged. An exception is a paper by Bernal and Keane (2011), who focus on children of single mothers. Their identification strategy exploits a large number of welfare reform variables, including work requirements, as instruments for maternal work and child care use. The authors' IV estimates continue to show that less time in maternal care lowers scores on cognitive ability tests. Also relevant, given its parallels to AYCEs, is the growing literature on parental leave systems. In the U.S. context, Rossin (2011) studies the impact of the federal FMLA on birth and infant health outcomes. Introduction of unpaid leave produced small increases in birth weight as well as decreases in premature births and infant mortality rates. In addition, Washbrook et al. (2011) study the developmental effects of state-based expansions to the FMLA. They find that exposure to more generous parental leave has little effect on children's cognitive and behavioral outcomes during the preschool year. Baker and Milligan's (2008;2010; work on Canada's parental leave expansion shows increases in breast feeding, no effects on cognitive or behavioral development at age three, and negative effects on cognitive development at ages four and five. Other recent studies evaluating historical expansions to the Danish (Rasmussen, 2010), German (Dustman & Schonberg, 2012), and Norwegian (Dahl et al., 2013) parental leave regimes generally find neutral effects on longer-run education and labor market outcomes. Particularly relevant is the large observational literature examining states' welfare waivers and the federal PRWORA. 6 However, few studies focus explicitly on work requirements, including AYCEs, or on child outcomes. 7 An early study by Paxson and Waldfogel (2003) uses state-level data to examine the prevalence of child abuse and foster care placements. A key finding is that enactment of an immediate work requirement is associated with increases in the number of children in foster care. Another early paper, by Haider et al. (2003), considers the relationship between three features of states' work requirements{the presence of any work requirement, the number of work hours required, and the presence of a full-family benefit sanction{on rates of breast-feeding among new mothers. The authors find that moderate to strict work requirements are associated with sizeable reductions in breast-feeding. A more recent paper by Kaestner and Lee (2005) is one of the few to examine direct measures of child well-being, although it does not consider work requirements per se. 6 In addition, there are several experimental evaluations of small scale, pre-PRWORA programs that featured a parental work requirement as a policy treatment. However, these studies are limited by their reliance on parental reports of children's school performance, as opposed to developmental metrics drawn from standardized tests or administrative data. In addition, most studies implemented random assignment when children were at least 36 months-old, and measured outcomes when they reached primary or secondary school. Therefore, the random assignment literature provides little guidance on the implications of first-year maternal employment for the short-to medium-run development. In any case, Grogger and Karoly's (2005) review of this work finds no systematic evidence that child outcomes were influenced by parents' exposure to work requirements. 7 Indeed, most welfare reform studies focus on outcomes related to maternal and family well-being. Nevertheless, the work on material well-being and consumption (e.g., Meyer & Sullivan, 2004;Kaushal et al., 2007) seems relevant, as does the work on mothers' health and health-related behaviors (e.g., Kaestner & Kaushal, 2003;Kaestner & Tarlov, 2006), illicit drug use (Corman et al., 2010), mental health (Rote & Quadagno, 2011), and subjective well-being (e.g., Herbst, 2012a;2013;Ifcher, 2011). Using National Natality Files from 1992 to 2000, their findings indicate that welfare reform led to small declines in first trimester prenatal care and increases in the incidence of low birth weight. To my knowledge, two published papers examine the impact of AYCEs, only one of which considers direct measures of child well-being. Hill (2011) uses the June Current Population Survey between 1998 and 2008 to examine the relationship between states' AYCEs and the employment of new mothers. The author finds that mothers exposed to long exemption periods, defined as AYCEs of 12 or more months, are substantially less likely to work full-time than those not exposed to an exemption. The second paper, by Washbrook et al. (2011), also using the ECLS-B, similarly finds that mothers residing in states with longer AYCEs are less likely to work in the first year after childbirth. However, despite delaying mothers' entry into the labor market, the authors find that AYCEs are not related to intermediate determinants of child well-being (e.g., breast-feeding, maternal depression, and parenting skills), nor do they influence direct measures of cognitive and behavioral development at the start of preschool. Both studies discussed above code states' AYCE policies through one or more dummy variables indicating the length of the baseline exemption in a given state-year cell. Specifically, Hill (2011) creates three indicators to denote families residing in states with an AYCE of zero months, three to nine months, or 12 months or more. Washbrook et al. (2011) create a single indicator to denote exposure to an AYCE of 12 months or more. Although both papers interact these variables with an indicator for marital status, the identifying variation is largely driven by the cross-state and temporal variation in the length of the baseline AYCE. This paper extends these coding schemes by first exploiting the large cross-state variation in the baseline AYCE. It then takes advantage of the differential policy treatment depending on the child's birth order. Recall that many states provide a comparatively long AYCE for mothers' first child and a significantly shorter one for each subsequent child. It also exploits states' rules on lifetime AYCE allotments, which are used to exempt mothers until the maximum number of months is reached. Finally, the paper uses information on the focal child's age-at-assessment to distinguish between mothers with varying AYCE allotments simply because they were interviewed at different times. Together, these sources of variation produce an individual-level measure of mothers' remaining AYCE allotment at a given point in time."}, {"section_title": "IV. Data", "text": "The primary dataset for this research is the Birth cohort of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-B). The ECLS-B is a nationally representative sample of approximately 11,000 children born in 2001. The survey was designed to track children's early home and educational experiences by conducting detailed parent and child care provider interviews and initiating a battery of child assessments at various points between birth and kindergarten entry. The first wave of data collection occurred when focal children were 9-months-old (2001)(2002), with follow-up surveys implemented at 24-months (2003), during the preschool year (2005)(2006), and after kindergarten entry (2006)(2007). The analysis sample is comprised of children from the 9-month wave of data collection. In particular, a home visit was initiated on or near the focal child's 9-month birthday to administer cognitive and psychomotor assessments and to conduct a 60-minute parent interview. 8 To craft the analysis sample, I exclude children whose mother is younger than 18 years old (216 observations) as well as those with missing information on maternal employment status (38), marital status at childbirth (73), educational attainment at childbirth (154), and the number of previous live births (24). I also drop children with missing information on the 9-month cognitive assessment (484). Mothers younger than 18 are omitted in light of states' minor parent provisions, stipulating that minors must reside in the home of a parent or guardian and remain enrolled in school in order to receive welfare benefits. Thus, such individuals are not likely to be influenced by states' work requirements. Also omitted are mothers enrolled in classes at a school, university, or college (1,083). Many states do not count participation in post-secondary education as an acceptable work activity, making it unlikely that such mothers would be influenced by work requirements. 9 After applying these restrictions, the result is an analysis sample of 8,558 children. 10 To fix attention on the group of children whose mothers are potentially eligible to receive welfare, and thus likely to be influenced by states' work requirements, I split the sample according to mothers' educational attainment and marital status. In particular, I define the group of potentially eligible mothers as those with less than a college degree or those who are unmarried. Such definitions are fairly standard in the U.S. welfare reform literature (e.g., Herbst, 2013a;Bitler et al., 2005;Fang & Keane, 2004;Grogger, 2003;Meyer & Rosenbaum, 2001;Schoeni & Blank, 2000). For the purposes of conducting sensitivity and falsification tests, I define the group of mothers ineligible to receive 11 welfare as those with at least a college degree and those who are married. A key motivation for using educational attainment and marital status to stratify the sample is that the welfare reform literature is unsettled as to the most appropriate characteristics for identifying welfare-eligible (treated) andineligible (untreated) women. Although it is common to use both educational attainment and marital status to create the groupings (e.g., Herbst, 2013a;Hill, 2012;Bitler et al., 2005;Kaushal & Kaestner, 2005), some studies use only education (e.g., Schoeni & Blank, 2000), while others use only marital status (e.g., Grogger, 2003;Meyer & Rosenbaum, 2001;Pingle, 2003). Relying on both characteristics therefore seems like the most comprehensive method for distinguishing between potentially eligible and ineligible families. To construct these groups, one option is to use information on mothers' educational attainment and marital status as of the 9-month assessment. However, applying these characteristics after the introduction of the policy treatment (i.e., exposure to work requirements) would lead to a problem of endogenous sample selection if these characteristics are influenced by welfare reform. Such concerns seem warranted in light of evidence from Bitler et al. (2004;  The primary outcome is a measure of children's early cognitive ability from the Bayley Short Form{Research Edition (BSF-R) test, administered at the 9-month assessment. This instrument was designed specifically for the ECLS-B and includes a subset of items from the full Bayley Scales of Infant Development-Second Edition (BSID-II), a widely used measure of early cognitive and motor development. Although the original BSID-II was designed to be completed in a clinical setting, the BSF-R was developed for ease of administration in a home environment. This study examines only 11 Birth certificate information is made available to researchers through a restricted-use data license. The marital status variable on the birth certificate distinguishes between mothers who are married and unmarried. It does not provide information on whether the mother is never married, divorced, separated, or widowed. 12 Given the definitional ambiguities associated with creating welfare-eligible and -ineligible groups, it reassuring that the TANF participation rate is substantially higher for the former group (11.5 percent) than for the latter group (0.4 percent). The TANF participation rate for mothers unmarried at birth is 20.8 percent, and that for mothers with less than a college degree at birth is 11.6 percent. This study examines two measures of early maternal employment. First, I test a binary indicator that equals unity if a given mother ever worked since the focal child's birth, and zero if the mother did not work since childbirth. At the 9-month assessment, mothers were asked if they worked for pay during the previous week. Among those not currently working, a follow-up question was asked whether they had done so since the focal child's birth. Children whose mothers answered affirmatively to either question were coded a value of one on this variable; all others were coded a value of zero. Approximately 58 percent of mothers in the welfare-eligible subsample were ever employed since childbirth, compared to 63 percent of mothers in the welfare-ineligible subsample. Second, I test a measure of cumulative employment, defined as the total number of months a given mother was employed as of the 9-month assessment. I construct this variable by combining information on the child's age (in months) and mothers' employment status at the 9-month assessment with a survey item asking about the (child's) age at which the mother returned to work. 13 The average welfare-eligible mother worked about 4.1 months since childbirth, only slightly less than the 4.5 months worked by the typical non-eligible mother. 14 Figure 1 displays the evolution in maternal employment throughout the first year of the child's life. In particular, it shows the cumulative proportion of welfare-eligible and -ineligible mothers who started working in the first 12 months after childbirth. Overall, maternal employment rates increased rapidly throughout the first six months of life, after which the transition into work begins to slow. Fully one-quarter of eligible and ineligible mothers began working within two months of childbirth, but then the employment trends begin to diverge. By the time children are six months old, 50 percent of welfare-eligible mothers had begun working, compared to 57 percent of their ineligible counterparts. A difference is still evident at 12 months, when 57 and 63 percent of mothers had started to work, respectively. Table 2 provides summary statistics for the subsample of welfare-eligible families. Children whose mothers did any work since childbirth scored about 1.5 points higher on the BSF-R than their counterparts whose mothers did not work. Working mothers are less likely to be high school dropouts, have fewer children, and are less likely to receive benefits from the Women, Infants, and Children program (WIC). In addition, total annual income in households with working mothers is about 15 percent higher on average. Finally, the children of employed mothers appear to be in better baseline health: they are less likely to be classified as low birth weight and less likely to be born prematurely. These descriptive data suggest that children of working mothers are more economically advantaged than their non-working counterparts, a pattern which may explain the test score gap in favor of the former group. The relative economic advantage of working families also highlights the central concern associated with OLS estimates of early maternal employment. In particular, working mothers are likely to be positively selected in ways that are difficult to fully account for, leading to OLS estimates that are biased upward."}, {"section_title": "V. Identification Strategy", "text": "It is useful to begin by specifying an OLS regression model of the child's cognitive ability production function: where i indexes children and s indexes state of residence; ln(A), the natural logarithm of the child's BSF-R score at the 9-month assessment, is a proxy for latent cognitive ability; and WORK is either the binary indicator for any maternal employment since childbirth or the measure of cumulative employment. The X is a matrix of observable family and child determinants of cognitive ability, Z indicates a set of region of birth indicators as well as a large number of state policy, economic, demographic, and political characteristics; and \u03b5 captures the unobserved determinants of child ability. Equation 1may be estimated separately on the subsamples of ECLS-B children residing with welfare-eligible and -ineligible mothers. For the binary measure of WORK, the coefficient of interest, \u03b2 1 , provides an estimate of the average difference in BSF-R scores between infants whose mothers worked and did not work since childbirth. 15 Given that test scores are measured on or near the child's 9-month birthday, \u03b2 1 should be interpreted as the short-run effect of early maternal work. The coefficient \u03b2 1 is identified through a cross-sectional comparison of children's BSF-R scores, a fairly common empirical strategy in the early maternal employment literature. However, even with a richly specified production function{ containing detailed child and family controls{concerns remain that working and non-working mothers are different in ways that influence child ability. One possibility is that some mothers have skills (e.g., human capital) or personality traits (e.g., social skills or higher motivation) that are positively correlated with labor market participation and child ability. If these maternal characteristics are omitted from equation 1, estimates of \u03b2 1 will be biased upward. On the other hand, it is conceivable that less-skilled mothers are more likely to work because they seek to offset the social and economic disadvantages that exist in the home environment. Failure to control for these characteristics in equation 1would impart a downward bias on \u03b2 1 . The summary statistics in Table 1{establishing that working mothers are more advantaged{suggest that the net effect of the unobservables is to bias \u03b2 1 upward. One method for dealing with this omitted variables problem is to leverage quasi-random variation in WORK through an instrumental variable (IV). This approach will produce consistent estimates of the impact of early maternal work if at least one variable is found to satisfy two conditions: (i) it is highly correlated with mothers' work decisions, and (ii) it is orthogonal to child ability except through its relationship with maternal work. In this paper, I attempt to identify the causal impact of early maternal employment by exploiting variation in states' AYCEs from the welfare work requirements. Specifically, AYCEs are expected to influence maternal employment decisions{such that smaller allotments of exempt time should increase the probability of working after child-birth{but are not expected to directly influence child ability. is determined at the time the child is assessed{align with the measure of early maternal employment, which commingles information on mothers' work history with that on mothers' current work status. For the sample of welfare-eligible families, the median on EXEMPT is 5.4 months (SD=6.9), with a minimum of -16.8 and a maximum of 21.8, indicating that the typical welfare-eligible mother had exhausted the AYCE allotment by over five months at the 9-month assessment. How much of this variation is driven by cross-state differences in AYCE policies? To investigate this, I produce separate density plots on EXEMPT for families exposed to less generous AY-CEs{defined as an AYCE of four months or less{and families exposed to more generous AY-CEs{defined as an AYCE of more than four months. These definitions are generated from states' baseline AYCE allotments and, if applicable, the birth-order-based allotments. As shown in Figure   3a, the entire distribution of EXEMPT for families exposed to less generous AYCEs resides to the right of the break-even point (i.e., zero months). Indeed, as of the 9-month assessment, over threequarters of such families exhausted the AYCE by five-to 10-months. On the other hand, Figure 3b shows that two-thirds of families exposed to more generous AYCEs had between one-and fivemonths remaining in their allotment. Thus, variation in EXEMPT strongly corresponds to the two key sources of (policy-induced) variation in states' AYCEs. To check whether the first identifying condition holds, I provide graphical and regressionbased evidence on the fist-stage relationship between EXEMPT and early maternal employment.  Table 3 formalizes the graphical evidence by presenting conditional estimates from the following first-stage equation: (2) where WORK is the measure of early maternal employment and EXEMPT, the IV, captures the number of months remaining in a given mother's AYCE allotment as of the 9-month assessment. All models include the full set of control variables appearing in equation 1, and the standard errors are adjusted for clustering within date of assessment cells. The variables in X and Z are listed in the notes to Table 3. Column (1) shows the estimates for the binary indicator of any work, while column AYCEs, then one would expect EXEMPT to be unrelated to the work decisions of mothers not atrisk of receiving welfare. Results in columns (1) and (2) suggest that EXEMPT passes the falsification test: the coefficients are substantially smaller in magnitude than their counterparts from the welfare-eligible subsample, and neither is statistically significant (F=1.3 and 1.5, respectively). The model shown in column 3 On the other hand, the coefficient in Panel B, from the subsample of ineligible families, implies a substantially smaller and imprecisely estimated reduction in welfare receipt. To serve as a valid instrument, EXEMPT must also fulfill the second identifying condition, in that it must be appropriately excluded from the child's cognitive ability production function. In other words, EXEMPT can only influence child well-being indirectly, through its effect on maternal employment. There are a few concerns with using AYCEs as an instrument for early maternal work. First, variation in EXEMPT is generated in part from a number of child-and family-level characteristics. Recall that EXEMPT is created not just from cross-state variation in AYCE allotments, but also from the child's birth-order and age-at-assessment. It is conceivable that both characteristics are related to mothers' work decisions and child well-being. Indeed, there is a well-documented relationship between birth-order and maternal time inputs (Lehman et al., 2012; Monfardini & See, 2012) as well as child outcomes (Black et al., 2005). A related issue is the potential endogeneity of fertility decisions, in which unobserved maternal characteristics are related to the number and timing of births. I deal with these complications by including in X explicit controls for the child's age at the 9month assessment, entered in decimal months and a quadratic in months, as well as a full set of birth-order fixed effects. In addition, the baseline model includes a number of pre-treatment maternal characteristics that may be correlated with fertility and employment preferences. In particular, I control for mothers' age (and age-squared) at birth, marital status at birth, and educational attainment at birth. I also account for mothers' use of tobacco products during the pregnancy, as this may proxy the quality of maternal time inputs, including difficult-to-measure human capital and personality traits as well as the child's stock of early health and ability. Dummy variables for low birth weight and premature births are also included because they are viewed as more explicit controls for early child health and development as well as the family's material resources. As an additional control for difficult-tomeasure family characteristics, I include the child's birth month in the baseline model. Indeed, Buckles and Hungerman (2010) document strong seasonal patterns in the socioeconomic characteristics of women giving birth at different times through the year. Mothers giving birth in the first quarter of the year are more likely to be teenagers, unmarried, and high school drop-outs. The second concern is that the influence of AYCEs on maternal employment could be con- Despite these policy differences, I take steps to ensure that the FMLA and related state leave policies do not confound the IV estimates on WORK. I included in the baseline model a dummy variable that equals unity for families residing in states that provide more generous parental leave provisions than the FMLA. The coding for this variable is consistent with the Washbrook et al. (2011) definition. I also experiment with a narrower version of the dummy, assigning a value of one to families in states with longer leave periods than the standard FMLA period. Doing so does not change the results. In a robustness check, I then exploit an ECLS-B survey item from the 9-month assess-ment that asks mothers whether they had taken maternity leave since the focal child's birth. Models that include a binary indicator for leave-taking yield first-stage and IV estimates similar to those reported in the baseline models. Given that an important source of variation in EXEMPT is the cross-state differences in AYCE allotments, another concern is a type of policy endogeneity, in which AYCEs are correlated with other state-level social policy, economic, or demographic characteristics that influence child ability. Of particular concern is the potential correlation of AYCEs with other features of welfare reform. For example, political decisions regarding the generosity of AYCE allotments could be related to the stringency of benefit sanctions or time limits. In addition, it is possible that states with more favora- only if they are systematically related to cross-state differences in child ability, conditional on the observable family and child controls. The state fixed effects do not appear to be strongly correlated with child cognitive ability in the ECLS-B. In a regression of the 9-month BSF-R score on the state- 19 The state controls include a dummy variable for more generous parental leave provisions than the FMLA, the log of federal and state Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) expenditures per child, the log of the maximum Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) benefit, the maximum AFDC/TANF benefit for a three-person family, a dummy variable for states that operate a formal welfare diversion program, a dummy variable for states with a lifetime time limit on welfare receipt, a dummy variable for states with a full benefit sanction in the first instance of non-compliance with the work requirements, a dummy variable for states operating a family cap policy, the state unemployment rate, the log of weekly earnings in the service sector, state GDP per capita, the log of per capita income, the log of population density, the log of total population, percent state population of women ages 15 to 39, percent state population of women ages 40 to 64, percent state population of whites, percent of state population under age 5, percent of state population uninsured, a dummy variable for states with a Republican governor, a dummy variable for gubernatorial election years, and the percent voting Republican in the previous Presidential election. of-birth fixed effects, the state indicators explain only six percent of the variation in test scores. Furthermore, the incremental R 2 associated with adding the fixed effects (to a model that includes the family and child controls) is 1.3 percent. Importantly, the fixed effects do not meaningfully outperform the region indicators and state-level controls: the incremental R 2 associated with these controls is 0.8 percent. The exogeneity of EXEMPT can be tested indirectly by examining its relation to family characteristics that should not be influenced by states' AYCEs. One way to conduct the test is by estimating reduced form relationships between EXEMPT and a set of pre-or at-birth maternal and child characteristics. The scatterplots in Figures 5a through 5h show these relationships. 21 Each plot represents the residualized mean for a given characteristic in one-month bandwidths of EXEMPT. The residuals were generated from an OLS regression of each characteristic on EXEMPT controlling only for the region of birth indicators and the 22 state-level variables. The plots also contain the best linear fit line constructed from the regression, whose slope represents the coefficient on EXEMPT. It is reassuring that EXEMPT is unrelated to an array of background characteristics that may influence child well-being. Indeed, the binned means for each characteristic are essentially flat over the distribution of EXEMPT. That the child and maternal characteristics are unrelated to the instrument in a regression that controls only for the state characteristics suggests that they are sufficient for removing policy endogeneity, and that state fixed effects are not necessary to maintain the validity of EXEMPT. Table 4 formalizes the scatterplots by estimating reduced form regressions accounting for the full set of controls. In no case is EXEMPT statistically significant. It is particularly encouraging that it is uncorrelated with pre-birth maternal employment, in light of the strong correlation between preand post-birth employment. 22 In addition, the instrument is uncorrelated with difficult-to-measure maternal and child ability endowments, as captured by grandparents' educational attainment. It is also unrelated to the child's season of birth, which is influenced by a complex set of maternal preferences and human capital characteristics that may influence child development (Buckles & Hungerman, 2010). Finally, EXEMPT is orthogonal to the child's birth weight and premature birth status, which are shown to have implications for a number of outcomes (e.g., Black et al., 2007;Case et al., 2004). Together, these results provide evidence in favor of the validity of EXEMPT as an identifying instrument."}, {"section_title": "VI. Estimation Results", "text": "Baseline OLS and IV Estimates is not statistically significant. Given the lack of explanatory power on EXEMPT in the first-stage equation, one might expect the IV estimates on WORK to be statistically insignificant. As shown in columns (4) and (5), the IV standard errors are substantially larger than their counterparts in Panel A, leading to highly imprecise estimates. In addition, the coefficients take the opposite sign compared to those based on the welfare-eligible subsample. Recall that the baseline estimates are generated from a sample of children born to mothers with less than a college degree or who are unmarried. As previously stated, the welfare reform literature is unsettled as to the most appropriate maternal characteristics for identifying welfare-eligible households. Therefore, results in the next two rows come from models that alter the definition of the analysis sample. Row (9) removes the marital status criterion, so that educational attainment is the sole maternal characteristic for delineating the sample. At least one previous welfare reform study uses education exclusively, perhaps because of concerns over sample selection biases introduced by using marital status as a criterion (Schoeni & Blank, 2000). The IV results based on this alternative sample definition are similar to the baseline estimates. Row (10) establishes more narrow criteria for defining welfare-eligible households. In particular, the sample includes children born to mothers with no more than a high school degree and who are unmarried. The point estimates are similar to the baselines estimates, although neither is statistically significant because the standard errors are substantially larger. One reason for this is that the narrower definition reduces the sample size by about two-thirds relative to the baseline sample. 24 The final robustness check, shown in row (11), tests an alternative version of the instrument. The first-stage F-statistics are 28.4 and 21.7 for the any work and cumulative work outcomes, re-spectively. As shown in row (9), the IV estimates are similar in magnitude to the baseline estimates, although the impact of cumulative work is no longer statistically significant."}, {"section_title": "Robustness", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Timing of the Maternal Return to Work", "text": "The results presented to this point suggest that work requirement-induced entries into employment during the first year of life have negative effects on children's cognitive development. It is possible that heterogeneity exists according to the timing of the return to work within the first year. Previous research finds that timing does indeed matter, with earlier returns having larger negative effects than later returns, although some of this work compares first-year employment with that occurring in the second and third years of life (e.g., Ruhm, 2004). Han, Waldfogel, and Brooks-Gunn (2001) examine heterogeneity within the first year by comparing the developmental implications of beginning work within the first three quarters after childbirth versus beginning work in the fourth quarter. Here again the authors find larger negative effects of earlier returns to work. I examine heterogeneity throughout the first year of life by using EXEMPT to instrument for a series of dummy variables indicating the age (of the child) at which the mother began working. Specifically, I construct 11 binary indicators for whether the mother was employed within the first two months after childbirth, within the first three months after childbirth, and so on up to 12 months. I then estimate separate IV models using EXEMPT as an instrument for each month-ofwork indicator. Results from this analysis are summarized in Figure 6, which plots the IV coefficient from each month-of-work model along with the upper and lower bounds of the 90 percent confidence interval. 25 A few observations are noteworthy. First, maternal returns to work{no matter when they occur during the first year of life{have negative effects on children's early cognitive development. All of the month-of-work indicators are negatively signed, and all but one are statistically significant at the 10 percent level. Nevertheless, there is substantial variation in the estimates, ranging from a 20 percent reduction in BSF-R scores (for children of mothers who worked within two months) to a 6.7 percent reduction in scores (for children of mothers who worked within 11 months). In addition, consistent with previous work, later returns to work generate smaller reductions in test scores, but only up to a point. The magnitude of the (negative) test score effect declines in each subsequent month-of-entry until about the eighth month of life, after which the negative effects stabilize. Indeed, starting work at some point in the fourth quarter of life produces substantially smaller and more stable test score effects than doing so in the first or second quarters of life."}, {"section_title": "Sub-Group Analyses", "text": "In results not presented in the tables, I estimate the baseline IV model on a number of sub-groups defined by the focal child's gender, race and ethnicity, and low birth weight status as well as the mother's pre-birth employment status. All of the sub-group analyses are estimated using the binary indicator of any post-birth maternal work and the continuous measure of cumulative months of work. Previous research is mixed on whether early maternal employment has larger negative effects on boys or girls. Some studies find larger effects on boys (e.g., Desai, et al., 1989;, others on girls (e.g., Bernal & Keane, 2011;Waldfogel, et al., 2002), and still others find no differences (e.g., Ruhm, 2004). I find little evidence that disadvantaged boys and girls are differentially affected by early maternal employment. Although any work as of the 9-month assessment is predicted to lower BSF-R scores of girls by more than boys (6.4 versus 5.6 percent test score reduction, respectively), the opposite holds for the measure of cumulative work (0.7 versus 1.0 percent, respectively). None of the individual IV coefficients are statistically significant, and neither are the tests of boy-girl differences in the IV estimates. Next, I examine test score effects across non-minority (i.e., white) and minority (i.e., black and Hispanic) children. Again, the literature yields mixed results, with some studies finding larger negative effects on white children (e.g. Bernal & Keane, 2011;Han, et al., 2001;Waldfogel, et al., 2002) and others finding no systematic differences (e.g., Ruhm, 2004). This analysis finds meaningful differences across non-minority and minority children. Any maternal work is predicted to reduce BSF-R scores of white children by 14.4 percent, compared to a decrease of 4.2 percent among black and Hispanic children. The comparable estimates for cumulative work are 1.9 percent for whites and 0.6 percent for blacks and Hispanics. Both white IV coefficients are statistically significant, as are the tests of non-minority-minority differences. I also examine whether severely disadvantaged children are more sensitive to early maternal work, using children's low birth weight status as a proxy for disadvantage. As previously stated, low birth weight babies have worse outcomes in the short-and long-run (e.g., Black et al., 2007;Case et al., 2004). Therefore, it is important to determine whether post-birth conditions such as early maternal employment exacerbate or mitigate those outcomes. The IV estimates indicate that maternal work may exacerbate the early disadvantages associated with low birth weight. For example, any work since childbirth is estimated to lower BSF-R scores by 24.1 percent among low birth weight children, compared to a 3.2 percent reduction among normal weight children. IV estimates based on the measure of cumulative work imply similarly large differences, with low birth weight children experiencing a test score drop of 2.9 percent for each month of work, while normal weight children experience a reduction of 0.5 percent. Both low birth weight IV coefficients are statistically significant, as are the tests of birth weight differences. In the final set of sub-group analyses, I examine whether mothers' pre-birth employment status has implications for the impact of post-birth employment on child ability. It is possible that disadvantaged women with pre-birth work experience sustain fewer family disruptions and find it easier to transition back into the labor market than their counterparts with less (or with less recent) prebirth work experience. For the purposes of this research, pre-birth work experience is defined as having worked at all in the year prior to giving birth. The IV results are suggestive of such a pattern. The impact of early maternal work is consistently associated with larger negative test score effects for children whose mothers did not work: such children experience test score reductions of 11.2 (any work) and 2.4 (cumulative work) percent, compared to 7.4 and 1.0 percent among children whose mothers did work prior to giving birth."}, {"section_title": "VII. Mechanisms", "text": "The results discussed to this point suggest that work-requirement-induced increases in early maternal employment have deleterious effects on disadvantaged children's short-run cognitive development. There are a number of mechanisms through which such an employment effect may influence child ability. The models presented in Table 7 provide  A number of recent studies find that family income is strongly related to early and later child development (e.g., Blau, 1999;Dahl & Lochner, 2012;Loken et al., 2010;Milligan & Stabile, 2011). Increases in family income likely improve parental and child physical and mental health, and enable parents to invest in goods and services that promote child ability. Thus, the first mechanism relates to family income. Although the ECLS-B does not contain a high-quality measure of family income or maternal earnings, the survey provides an indicator denoting whether family income is below the Federal Poverty Line (FPL). As shown in row (1), a large fraction of welfare-eligible children reside in poor families (33 percent). Nevertheless, the reduced form estimate on EXEMPT implies that reductions in the AYCE time allotment is associated with lower poverty rates. This finding is consistent with the IV results, in which work-requirement-induced increases in maternal employment decrease the likelihood of falling below the FPL. Although these results appear to be at odds with the negative test score effects, a few caveats should be kept in mind. First, it is possible that the income required to bring a family above the FPL is not sufficient to improve the child's cognitive ability. Second, the FPL measure is based on current rather than permanent income, with the latter shown to be more important to child ability. Finally, as will be shown, family income is the only mechanism that yields a result consistent with an improvement in child ability. In other words, early maternal employment may produce a sufficiently strong set of headwinds that cannot be overcome by improvements in families' material well-being. The next set of rows [rows (2) through (4)] investigates mechanisms related to maternal health. It appears that early maternal work does not improve overall health, as shown in row (2), defined as self-reports of overall health as excellent or very good (as opposed to good, fair, or poor). Furthermore, the results in rows (3) and (4) suggest that maternal employment may increase depression symptomology, as measured by the 12-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale (Radloff, 1977). 26 Maternal responses on the individual items are summed to produce the full CES-D scale. The sample mean is 5.6, with a minimum value of zero and a maximum of 36. The IV estimates on the full CES-D [row (3)] imply substantively meaningful, but imprecisely estimated, increases in depression symptomology. Row (4) recodes one of the items into a binary indicator that equals unity if a given mother felt depressed during one or more days throughout the previous week. Here, the IV estimates indicate that early maternal work leads to statistically significant increases in depressive symptoms. The next four analyses, depicted in rows (5) through (8), relate to various features of the mother-child relationship as well as the quality of maternal time inputs. Row (5) examines whether work-requirement-induced increases in maternal employment have implications for breast-feeding. A large literature finds that breast-feeding is associated with numerous short-and long-run physiological, health, and cognitive benefits (e.g., Horwood & Fergusson, 1998;Lawrence, 2000). Previous studies also find that early maternal employment can disrupt breast-feeding practices (Lindberg, 1996), and at least one study indicates that welfare reform lowered rates of breast-feeding among disadvantaged mothers (Haider et al., 2003). The reduced form and IV results, which show substantial reductions in breast-feeding, are consistent with this evidence. Row 6 constantly\" and \\needs a lot of help to fall asleep.\" 28 The results consistently suggest that working mothers are more likely to respond affirmatively to these statements. Finally, row (8) examines the frequency with which mothers read to the child. I create a binary indicator that equals unity if a family member reads to the child at least one time per week. The estimates indicate that maternal employment reduces the likelihood that the focal child is read to on a consistent basis. The final set of analyses, shown in rows (9) through (11), examine the extent to which maternal employment influences the use of non-parental child care. Approximately one-half of ECLS-B infants participate in non-parental arrangements (as of the 9-month survey), and they do so for 33 hours per week (Herbst, 2013b). There is a large literature in economics and developmental psychology studying the relationship between non-parental child care and short-run outcomes. Although the literature is mixed overall, a few recent studies provide causal evidence that early child care utilization lowers cognitive ability test scores among disadvantaged children (Bernal & Keane, 2011;Herbst, 2013b). Results in rows (9) through (11) indicate that the infants of employed mothers participate in non-parental care earlier than their non-working counterparts, and they participate in this care more intensively. In particular, such children are more likely to have started their first child care spell within the first three months of life. As of the 9-month assessment, children of working mothers accrue more months in non-parental arrangements, and they spend considerably more hours per week in those settings. In sum, the results presented in Table 7 suggest that several factors may explain the negative effects of early maternal employment. Although working mothers experience improved material well-being{defined as lower poverty rates{they do not appear to be in better health, and there is suggestive evidence of increased depressive symptoms. Furthermore, children of working mothers are less likely to be breast fed, and there is a drop in the quality of mother-child interactions, defined as a reduction in the frequency that family members read to the child. Working mothers also report increased behavioral difficulties with the child, including persistent demands for attention and requiring assistance to fall asleep. Finally, children of working mothers are more likely to experience nonparental child care early in life: they are exposed to their first non-parental arrangement at a younger age, and spend more time in these settings throughout the first year of life."}, {"section_title": "VIII. Conclusion", "text": "The aim of this paper is to provide causal evidence on the impact of early maternal employment on young children's cognitive development. It studies this issue within the context of a highly policyrelevant population{economically disadvantaged mothers and their children{and uses a policy lever of considerable interest{exemptions from the welfare work requirements{to derive the instrumental variables estimates. Indeed, the local average treatment effects (LATE) estimated here have potentially important policy implications because they reflect the impact of a fundamental economic be-havior{maternal labor supply following child birth{whose impact on child ability is derived from one of the most provocative social policy reforms of the past several decades. Using a nationally representative sample of infants from the ECLS-B, I find that AYCEs from the welfare work requirements are strongly correlated with first-year maternal employment. Specifically, reductions in the AYCE time allotment are predicted to increase the rate and intensity of employment in the first year after childbirth. Results from OLS estimation of the child ability production function suggest that children of working mothers score higher on the BSF-R than their counterparts whose mothers did not work since childbirth. However, the IV results suggest that the OLS estimates are severely biased upward. When AYCE allotments are used to instrument for early maternal work, I find that BSF-R scores are lower among children of working mothers. Each month of work is estimated to lower cognitive ability test scores by 0.08 SDs. This paper also illuminates some the mechanisms through which the negative employment effects likely operate. Although families with working mothers are less likely to be poor, it appears that the improvement in material well-being is insufficient to fully offset the many challenges catalyzed by early maternal work. Working mothers are not in better overall health than their nonworking counterparts, and there is suggestive evidence that they experience an increase in depressive symptoms. Furthermore, children of working mothers are less likely to be breast fed, and they are read to less frequently. Working mothers report increased behavioral complications with the child, including demands for attention and difficulties falling asleep. Finally, children of working mothers are exposed non-parental child care arrangements at a younger age, and they spend more time in these settings throughout the first year of life. This paper's first-stage employment results are consistent with those in Hill (2012) and Washbrook et al., (2011), which find that exposure to more generous AYCE allotments are associated with reductions in employment rates among disadvantaged mothers. The only other study to examine the developmental impact of AYCEs is Washbrook et al., (2011), who provide reduced form estimates that imply neutral effects on a wide range of intermediate and direct measures of child well-being. Nevertheless, the IV results in this paper are consistent with previous welfare reform studies finding reductions in breast feeding rates (Haider et al., 2003) as well as declines in prenatal care and increases in the incidence of low birth weight (Kaestner & Lee, 2005).
