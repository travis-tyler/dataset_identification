[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Human activity has a significant impact on the landscape . Approximately 40% of the Earth's land surface has been transformed by humans from its natural state into agricultural land, urban and industrial areas, or artificial reservoirs [Kates et ]. Clearly, it is essential that regional and global-scale terrestrial ecosystem and biogeochemistry models include the effects of human activity in their calculations. To do so, models must include information on the nature, extent, and location of land use activities. For large-scale studies, there are two primary sources of information that can be used: remote-sensing and census-based statistics. These sources have different characteristics and strengths (Table 1) . Remote-sensing products generally have remarkable spatial resolution (<1 km) of land cover (e.g., vegetation type).\nCensus statistics often include extensive information on land use (e.g., type of management). Unfortunately, neither of these sources of information is sufficient. Remote-sensing products focus more on land cover than land use, although important aspects of land use can be inferred from changes in land cover [e.g., Skole and Tucker, map of the terrestrial surface with 17 land cover categories. We eliminated the category \"Water Bodies\" from the classification and spatially aggregated the remaining product to the state level (the resolution of the census data described below), by overlaying a political boundary map and counting pixels in each category within each state. Table 2 "}, {"section_title": "Census Statistics", "text": "Many sets of statistics on land use are available for the United States, from sources such as the Census of Agriculture, National Agricultural Statistics Service, the Natural Resource Conservation Service, and the Food and Agriculture Organization. Among these, the USDA Major Land-Uses data set [USDA, 1996] is unique in that it provides a classification of all land at the state level. While county level statistics on cropland exist, no substate level census product exists that considers all land with multiple land use categories. The Major Land-Uses data set describes five major land use classes: Cropland, Pasture, Forest, Special, and Other. We combined the particularly heterogeneous classes Special and Other into a single category, Other, and used this with the remaining three major land use classes from this data set (see Table 3 \nBoth the remote-sensing classification and the census categorization are complete descriptions of the land surface in the sense that all land is classified in each product (e.g., Figure 1 ). However, as Tables 2 and 3 show, the classification systems are different. The land cover product has 16 terrestrial classes, with distinctions based on characteristics of the dominant vegetation such as evergreen/deciduous, or forest/woodland/shrubland. It is based on a 1-km resolution remote-sensing product. The land use data are available in tabular form (state totals) and are aggregated into four broad land use classes. Since the data are based on survey responses, they can reflect a finer resolution view of the landscape. At the same time, because the census data Description land covered with temporary crops followed by harvest and a bare soil period lands with a mosaic of croplands, forests, shrublands, and grasslands in which no one component comprises more than 60% of the landscape woody vegetation less than 2 m tall and with shrub cover between 10-60% herbaceous and other understory systems, and with forest canopy cover between 10-30% lands with herbaceous types of cover lands dominated by trees exceeding 2 m and with >60% canopy cover lands dominated by trees exceeding 2 m and with >60% canopy cover trees exceeding 2 m and canopy cover >60%, with an annual leaf-on and leaf-off cycle trees exceeding 2 m and canopy cover >60%, with an annual leaf-on and leaf-off cycle tree communities with interspersed mixtures or mosaics of the other four forest cover types woody vegetation less than 2 m tall and with >60% shrub canopy herbaceous and other understory systems, and with forest canopy cover between 30-60% land and covered by buildings and other man-made structures permanent mixtures of water and herbaceous or woody vegetation that cover extensive areas lands under snow and/or ice cover throughout the year exposed soil, sand, rocks, or snow with <10% vegetated cover during any time of the year aAfter Belward [1996] . The \"Open Water\" class has been masked out of data.\n(a) State land cover areas (10 6 km 2) \u2022 Tables 2 and 3 A is a 4 x 16 matrix and thus potentially has 64 unknown parameters. However, the requirement that all land that was remotely sensed must be mapped into some land use category reduces the number of unknown parameters to 48. In addition, many of the possible relationships between particular remotesensing classes and land use categories are not likely to be significant (e.g., \"Snow and Ice\" mapped to \"Pasture\") and thus many of the remaining parameters in A can be set to zero. To construct an efficient version of A with fewer parameters, we sequentially fit A to the census data and removed unneeded parameters as follows. The first round of parameter estimation resulted in a best fit to all state land use data with the full parameter matrix, i.e., 48 free parameters. This is referred to as the \"full model.\" We then set to zero any parameters estimated to have very small values (<0.001) and set to one any parameters estimated to have very large values (>0.999). This generated a new matrix with fewer parameters. We then estimated a new set of best-fit parameters with this simplified matrix and again eliminated very small and very large free parameters. We repeated this procedure several times; in the final round of parameter elimination we increased the thresholds (to <0.05 and >0.95, respectively). At each stage we checked to ensure that eliminating parameters did not result in a reduction in goodness-of-fit as compared to the full model. Subsequent parameter reduction attempts caused the goodness-of-fit to decline. The resulting simplified model is referred to as the Table 4 for parameter values). Crosses represent area totals based on best-fit parameter values for the full model. Hatched squares represent national area totals based on best-fit parameter values for the regional model (see Table 4 ).\nWe also estimated separate parameter values of A for each of the seven regions (Table 4) Figures 2e-2f) . The improvements were gained by increasing the number of estimated parameters from 12 to 84 (Table 4) ."}, {"section_title": "Models Relating the Remote-Sensing Product and the", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Cropland", "text": "Despite the fact that the area of Cropland in the census is \u202260% greater than the area in the Cropland land cover class estimated by remote sensing nationally (Tables 2 and 3 (Figure 3a) . However, the regional model had some large differences in parameters values (Table 4 ). In four regions the Cropland to Cropland mapping parameter (a\u2022,\u2022) was >_98%, while in the Southeast, this parameter dropped to 53% (Table 4) . Four states in the Southeast (Florida, Georgia, Lousiana, and South Carolina) have remote sensing Cropland land cover more than 50% greater than the census. This could be due to misclassification of remote sensing imagery, underreporting to the census for land use data, or a mismatch in class definitions (Tables 2 and 3) . None of these model parameters caused large differences in the total amount of Cropland mapped nationally (Figure 3a) ."}, {"section_title": "Pasture", "text": "The Grassland land cover class was fully mapped into the Pasture land use (a2,4 = 1.0; Table 4 Figure 3b ). In the full model, there was also a small contribution to Pasture from Cropland (Figure 3b ), but the parameter (a2,/) was less than 0.05 and was eliminated in the reduced models without significant reduction in goodness-of-fit nationally."}, {"section_title": "Forest", "text": "Two forest land cover classes (evergreen broadleaf and deciduous needleleaf) were mapped not to the Forest land use but to the Other land use (Table 4) (Table  4 ). Full-model parameters were similar (Figure 3d ), except that Cropland to Other (a4,/) was smaller because in the full model Cropland was also mapped to Pasture and Forest. In the regional model case, 10 of the parameters mapping to Other took on high values (>0.80), but they were always associated with relatively small areas (<1% of a regional area)."}, {"section_title": "Maps of Land Use", "text": "The results to this point have focused on scales ranging from states to national totals. Close agreement between remotely sensed land cover and census statistics on land use can be achieved at these scales with simple models. In this section, we use the models that we developed (As) to produce maps of estimated land use with relatively high-spatial resolution (0.5\u00f8). To produce these maps, we aggregated the remote-sensing data to 0.5 \u00f8 and applied the national (Figure 6b) . Our national-model estimate consistently differs from their estimate in cells that are remotely sensed as pure (or nearly pure) cropland because our national model estimates that only 87% of pure cropland pixels are actually cropland. In the regional model estimate, this difference is less pronounced because in many regions the relevant parameter (a/,/) is estimated to be near 100% (Table 4) . However, other large discrepancies exist. Regionally, the differences between our estimates and that of Ramankutty and Foley [ 1998] are perhaps most pronounced in the southeast and east northcentral, where Ramankutty and Foley estimated a much larger area in cropland than either our model or the Major Land-Uses data set (Table 5) ."}, {"section_title": "Interpretation of Lands in the Other Land Use Category", "text": "Other land is a very heterogeneous land use category that occupies a large fraction of the country (>15%). Clearly, knowledge of specific land use activities and land cover types present on Other lands is essential to make any use of this category in ecosystem modeling studies. Some additional land use information can be gained from the Major Land Uses data set by disaggregating Other into its few component subcategories. However, the land use data set says nothing about the land cover on those lands.\nOur models can be used in a secondary analysis to estimate the land cover associated with each land use, perhaps most importantly Other land. Just as our models estimated that the amount of Other land varies spatially because the land cover information used to estimate the presence of Other lands varies at these scales, our models also estimate that the composition of Other varies spatially. To illustrate this point, we produced maps and corresponding pie charts of the estimated composition of Other lands across the United States (Figures 7 and 8) . Forested regions in the northeast and northern southeast are estimated to have Other lands which appear forest-like to remote sensing. Generally, nonforested regions in the central and western parts of the country have Other lands which appear nonforested. Concentrations of Other land that are estimated to be nonvegetated can be seen in parts of Utah, Texas, and the urban centers along the northeast coast."}, {"section_title": "Discussion and Conclusions", "text": "Because ofthe large effects of land use on ecosystem structure and dynamics, ecosystem models must incorporate spatially resolved Although, the Other category is so heterogeneous that it is difficult to interpret on its own for ecosystem modeling, this study provides useful information by estimating the land cover composition of Other land in every grid cell. Clearly more land use information than these broad land use categories provide is needed for ecosystem models; our study has made an enhanced version of this set of land use information available at resolution that is useful for ecosystem and biogeochemistry models. The methods in this paper included a goodness-of-fit criterion and a parameter estimation procedure to define optimal relationships between a land cover and land use data set at the state scale. Developing models that map land cover areas to land use areas for each state required trade-offs between fitting areas for each of the land use categories in different areas. While the results from this study are encouraging, a perfect fit between the data sets was not possible. There are several possible causes for discrepancies, but it is difficult to discriminate between these causes. There is error in the remote sensing classifications of land cover [Scepan, 1999] , and there is likely to be error in the census statistics on land use (though we cannot evaluate the magnitude of this). Each of these could lead to difficulty in matching areas. A major cause of the discrepancies may be the heterogeneity inherent in the land cover and land use categories themselves. Loveland et al. [1999] noted that significant discrepancies in land area estimates exist between different land cover products and attributed this to different map legends (i.e., different available classes of land cover). This same issue arises in our analysis. Perhaps the largest factor is the fact that the same land cover types can have different uses in different areas. For example, land classified as woodland or shrubland land cover might be in the Forest land use, or grazed and classified in the census as Pasture/Range, or set aside as a state or national park and classified as Other.\nWe developed two sets of maps of land use corresponding to two models relating land use and land cover data: the national model and the regional model. The first uses a single parameter set for the entire country. The second uses the same model form but separate sets of parameter values in each of seven regions. A visual comparison of these maps reveals how similar the large-scale spatial patterns are between the national and regional parameterizations of our model. However, the regional parameterization generally produced a better match to the land use statistics at state, regional, and national scales (Figure 2; Table 4 ) but at the expense of having many additional parameters. The overall improvement of the regional parameterizations is likely due to both the variability in dominant land cover types across the United States (see Figure  1 ) and also variability in how particular land cover types are used. The fact that regional parameterizations of the Mountain and Pacific regions did not lead to substantial improvement in the fit suggests that there may be different uses of important land cover classes within those ecologically diverse regions. Alternatively, there may be errors in either the census or remote sensing products at a subregional scale, which preclude a common good-fit mapping between the land cover and land use products for those two regions.\nThe major result of this study is a set of maps of land use in multiple categories at 0.5 \u00f8 resolution (Figures 4 and 5) . It is anticipated that these maps will be useful for new ecosystem modeling studies working to incorporate the effects of land use [e.g., Hurtt et al., 1998; Schimel et al., 2000] . However, these maps should be used with caution until tested with independent fine-scale information. We compared our estimates of cropland at the 0.5 \u00f8 scale to those of Ramankutty and Foley [1998] and found both broad regions of agreement and substantial differences between our estimates in some locations. We know that our estimates of Cropland are generally as close or closer to the Major Land Uses data set ( Figure 6 , Table 5 ), but we do not know which if either data set is accurate at finer spatial scales. We also do not have independent information on the accuracy of the Major Land Uses data set. What is clear from other studies is that land use is having a major impact on terrestrial ecosystems, and ecosystem models attempting to address this must have spatially resolved information on that land use. The study is a nascent attempt to provide such information. provided thoughtful discussions on land use data.
