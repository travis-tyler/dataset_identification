[{"section_title": "", "text": "Asia, with more than 3 billion people from many different cultures and countries, is home to nearly two-thirds of the world's population. The United States has drawn from these countries and cultures its \"Asian Americans,\" some with recent attachments to that continent and some with very distant connections. In the world of social science and educational research, Asian Americans are frequently represented as one group, and summarized with one number, like an arithmetical average. Yet, Asian Americans think of themselves as (and are) quite different from one another. We are left with one number to represent all Asian Americans largely because of problems of sample size in national statistical and research studies. In the 1990 census, where everyone is counted, we have a lot of data about 11 different groups of \"Asians or Pacific Islanders.\" We know from the census, for example, that 42,411 Chinese Americans, age 18 to 24, were high school graduates; that 25,015 Cambodian American adults had less than five years of schooling; and that 318,305 Japanese Americans say they do not speak 2 English \"very well.\" So, it is well-established practice, where the data permit, to report data on Asian Americans by their ethnicity. About eight years ago, ETS research produced a study of \"language minority\" students, breaking Hispanic American students into four different countries of origin (in that study, however, funds were available for an expanded sample and a parent survey, enabling researchers to examine correlates of differences in achievement). We believe it is very desirable to particularize education data whenever it is possible. Nowhere, however, have we had detailed information available about the educational characteristics of Asian Americans, broken down by nation or region."}, {"section_title": "Drawing on the Second", "text": "Follow-Up Survey of the 1988 National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS:88), Heather Kim (formerly a postdoctoral fellow at ETS) has been able to provide such information. She examines differences among six major ethnic groups of Asian American high school seniors in their socioeconomic characteristics, parent expectations and involvement, educational values, school behaviors, academic performance, and educational aspirations. These differences are examined by ethnic group and by whether students were foreignor native-born. The availability of education data by race and ethnic origin has become a staple of public and education policy. The fact that it is of such interest reflects the focus the nation has had on issues of equality. Given the history of the U.S. as a land of immigrants, this focus has been kaleidoscopic, reflecting the character of our citizens' origins and of our concerns about the success of assimilation. Even concepts of \"race\" have changed over this history, as recently pointed out by Neil Rudenstine, President of Harvard University, in his 1996 President's Report, Diversity and Learning. He points out that at one time Irish Americans were considered a race. The kaleidoscope will continue to turn; it was only about 30 years ago that U.S. employment and other statistics were separated simply into \"White\" and \"Non-White,\" defining millions of Americans by what they were not. We believe that part of the turning willand shouldbreak such large groupings into smaller ones with more common backgrounds and experiences. We hope that this report contributes to this process. While most Americans know that an \"average\" is simply a convenient statistical representation, it tends to convey an image, particularly when it is pointed out, over and over again, that the average achievement for one group is higher than that of another. A large proportion of Americans know that Asian Americans, on average, score higher on a wide range of educational assessments than any other racial or ethnic group. This tends to promote a stereotype of Asian Americans; some, in fact, have referred to Asian Americans as a \"model minority.\" We know that this stereotype is pervasive when it gets embedded in the nation's humor. Not long ago a cartoon appeared in which a student, being confronted about poor grades, says: \"What do you think I am, Asian or something?\" There is, in fact, large variation in the educational background and achievement of Asian American students; as in other groups, the data for individuals range from the top to the bottom. We see this diversity emerge in the data for subgroups provided by Heather Kim, although we are still looking at the average for each subgroup. The \"model minority\" stereotype has undesirable consequences for a number of reasons. One that Kim points out is that Asian Americans from less advantageous backgrounds tend to get bypassed in terms of supportive services. Stereotypes can begin to fade as we recognize facts such as: While 74 percent all U.S. high school seniors aspire to a college degree or higher, the percentage ranges from 95 percent of South Asian seniors to 77 percent of Filipino seniors and 65 percent of Southeast Asian seniors. El While 29 percent of all U.S. high school seniors said they did at least 10 hours of homework each week, the percentage for Asians ranges from 56 percent of South Asians to 43 percent of Chinese, to 32 percent of Filipinos. There is no effort in this report to compare the degree of diversity or homogeneity of Asian Americans and other racial/ethnic groups. Neither is there any effort here to try to explain why there is such divergence in these averages, either between Asian Americans and other groups, or among Asian American subgroups. Finally, all the analyses contained here are univariate; multivariate analyses were beyond the scope of this study. These are potentially fruitful subjects for further research."}, {"section_title": "SUMMARY AND HIGHEIGIETS", "text": "While the population of Asia, the world's largest continent, is over 3 billion people of many different countries and cultures, diversity among Asian American students is not often acknowledged.

Academic Performance Native-born Asian American seniors had higher reading scores than foreign-born seniors. Although many Asian American students are highly successful, large numbers of them are in need of assistance, support, and encouragement from parents, teachers, counselors, and institutions. The myth of uniform success among Asian American students has comouflaged the disadvantages experienced by many of these students. Asian immigrants have been coming to the United States since the middle of the 19th century, beginning with the Chinese. The early Chinese immigration to the United States began about 1840 when they arrived in search of economic well-being. Most of the early Chinese settled on the West Coast, earning money during the California gold rush and the construction of the transcontinental railroad. The Chinese were followed by Japanese immigrants who first came to the United States in large numbers between 1890 and 1920. The early Japanese found employment on railroads, in canneries and in mines. The Koreans were next to arrive; they came in much smaller numbers about 1903. Most of the early Koreans resided in Hawaii and worked the sugar and pineapple plantations. The last of the early Asian immigrants to the United States were the Asian Indians and the Filipinos. The early Asian immigrants' dedication to hard work and struggle for success made major contributions to the economic growth and development of the West Asian Americans also have a higher percentage of more-than-oneworker-per-household families than do Whites. Finally, Asian Americans receive less poverty assistance and welfare than the general population and are more likely to experience a discrepancy between their education and their income. Because of the disparity between the stereotype and the truth, the model minority image has adversely affected Asian American students. Indeed, by focusing on academic success, the stereotype has resulted in a lack of studies addressing low academic achievement among Asian American students. The model minority stereotype does not help counselors, teachers, and policy-makers understand the difficulties and problems that Asian American students face, and has kept Asian American students from receiving needed student services and support. Further, the widely believed stereotype of Asian American academic success appears to have led to official neglect of the development of programs and services for Asian American students. Therefore, in order to achieve a better understanding of Asian American students, it is important not to make generalizations about the success of Asian Americans but to examine the diversity among Asian Americans. This report examines differences among Asian American high school seniors in their socioeconomic characteristics, parental expectations for and involvement with education, educational values, school behaviors, academic performance, and educational aspirations. These variables are examined by ethnicity and generational status.2 The data in this report are from the 2The study employs cross-tabulations of the data to show differences on the variables of interest for ethnic groups and for foreign-and native-born students. Of course, there are interactions here. Southeast Asians, for example, are more likely to be foreign-born than the other groups and generally fall at the lowend of the variables of interest, e.g., they tend to have lower educational aspirations than other ethnic groups. While this report does not employ any multivariate analyses, separate cross-tabulations were run for foreign-and native-born students. In general, relative rankings of the ethnic groups remained the same. The immigration history of Southeast Asians is shorter than that of other Asian ethnic groups, and therefore they may not be as settled into American society. In addition, most Southeast Asians came to the U.S. as political refugees, whereas other Asians came voluntarily in pursuit of economic and social well-being.  Among the high school seniors in these six Asian American ethnic groups, about 45 percent were nativeborn, while some 55 percent were foreignborn. Approximately half of the Asian American seniors were male (50.2 percent) and half were female (49.8 percent). The breakdowns for each ethnic group are shown in The majority of Southeast Asians (75 percent) and Chinese (72 percent) were foreign-born, while the majority of Filipinos (71 percent) were native-born. More than half of Japanese (55 percent) and South Asians (53 percent) were native-born, while less than half of Koreans (47 percent) were native-born. Nearly two-thirds of Japanese high school seniors were female. More than half of Chinese and Filipino students were male, while more than half of Korean, South Asian, and Southeast Asian students were female.
