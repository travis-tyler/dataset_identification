[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract There is a deficiency of knowledge regarding how traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with age at onset (AAO) of cognitive impairment in older adults. Participants with a TBI history were identified from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI 1/GO/2) medical history database. Using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, the AAO was compared between those with and without TBI, and potential confounding factors were controlled. The AAO was also compared between those with mild TBI (mTBI) and moderate or severe TBI (sTBI). Lastly, the effects of mTBI were analyzed on the AAO of participants with clinical diagnoses of either mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD). The AAO for a TBI group was 68.2 \u00b1 1.1 years [95 % confidence interval (CI) 66.2-70.3, n = 62], which was significantly earlier than the AAO for the non-TBI group of 70.9 \u00b1 0.2 years (95 % CI 70.5-71.4, n = 1197) (p = 0.013). Participants with mTBI history showed an AAO of 68.5 \u00b1 1.1 years (n = 56), which was significantly earlier than the AAO for the non-TBI group (p = 0.032). Participants with both MCI and mTBI showed an AAO of 66.5 \u00b1 1.3 years (95 % CI 63.9-69.1, n = 45), compared to 70.6 \u00b1 0.3 years for the non-TBI MCI group (95 % CI 70.1-71.1, n = 935) (p = 0.016). As a conclusion, a history of TBI may accelerate the AAO of cognitive impairment by two or more years. These results were consistent with reports of TBI as a significant risk factor for cognitive decline in older adults, and TBI is associated with an earlier AAO found in patients with MCI or AD."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been studied as a risk factor associated with cognition deterioration for several decades [1] . However, the details of how TBI associates with the onset of cognitive impairment is still unclear due to a number of factors such as varied criteria for defining TBI severity [2] , as well as various types and severity of cognitive impairment. A history of TBI has been found to correlate with an elevated risk for developing cognitive impairment [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . For example, a 5-year follow-up study found that TBI could increase the risk of developing dementia by 1.7 fold after adjusting for covariates [8] . The dementia associated with TBI could be either the Alzheimer's disease (AD) type or the non-AD type [2, 9, 10] .

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a history of TBI and the severity of TBI are associated with the age at onset (AAO) of cognitive impairment in older adults.

The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. ADNI is the result of efforts of many coinvestigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the US and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 subjects, but ADNI has been followed by ADNI-GO and ADNI-2. To date these, three protocols have recruited over 1500 adults, ages 55-90, to participate in the research, consisting of cognitively normal older individuals, people with early or late MCI, and people with early AD. The follow-up duration of each group is specified in the protocols for ADNI-1, ADNI-2 and ADNI-GO. Subjects originally recruited for ADNI-1 and ADNI-GO had the option to be followed in ADNI-2.

Therefore, the final sample included 81 participants with a history of TBI. Demographic and clinical information for the 81 participants with TBI history was summarized in Table 1 . The age at injury of TBI showed a bimodal distribution and the average age at injury is 35.4 \u00b1 24.8 years old.

Participants with both AD and mTBI history had an earlier AAO (\\2 years) than the AD group. However, the difference was not statistically significant ( Fig. 3 ; Table 2 )."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Previous studies have shown that TBI is an important risk factor for developing either AD or non-AD type dementia [2, 9, 10] . There has been less research quantifying how TBI or severity of TBI is associated with the AAO of cognitive impairment [11] . In our retrospective study, participants with a TBI history had an accelerated AAO of cognitive impairment. In considering possible mechanisms of impact on the onset of cognitive decline, we note that in humans, axons damaged by TBI have been shown to serve as a large reservoir of amyloid-beta, which may explain the observed amyloid plaques found in the brains of TBI subjects [23] . In a rat model, the overexpression of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) was also observed following TBI [24] . Since the presence of amyloid-beta plaques is a key feature of AD, these data indirectly support TBI as a risk factor for associating with cognition deterioration as well as an earlier AAO than in older adults without a TBI history. Although the sTBI group shows a trend of having an earlier AAO than the mTBI group, the present study did not have a sufficient power to test the difference. The sample size for the sTBI group is small due to the enrolment criteria for the ADNI. Participants with a history of significant head trauma followed by the persistent neurologic deficits or known structural brain abnormalities were excluded from the ADNI (see exclusion criteria in the protocols for the ADNI 1/GO/2). An underlying mechanism for developing cognitive impairments from mTBI was suggested by findings that white matter abnormalities from symptomatic mTBI patients show a similar distribution pattern as in early AD type dementia [25] . By contrast, severe TBIs can initiate AD type pathological processes as an acute phase response to TBI by overexpressing APP and leading to amyloid-beta plaque deposition [26] . Both mTBI and sTBI appeared to influence the onset of cognitive decline, although the difference between AAOs based on TBI severity was not significant in this study.\nAlthough some symptoms from mTBI can be resolved within a few months of post-injury [1] , a history of mTBI was shown to be associated with a significantly earlier AAO of cognitive impairment. by more than 4 years in patients with a cognition diagnosis of MCI. The mTBI has a smaller non-significant effect (less than 2 years) on the AAO of cognitive impairment observed in the patients with a diagnosis of AD.\nOur findings have important implications for clinical diagnosis and prognosis, as well as for applying therapeutic interventions to decrease the likelihood of developing cognition impairments after TBI. As for any retrospective study, one limitation for this study comes from the possible recall bias for either TBI history or cognitive symptoms, which were reported by the participants. The second limitation is that the effects of mTBI on AAO were only studied in patients with either MCI or AD. Individuals with TBI could have different aetiologies for cognitive impairment other than AD or chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) [27] . For example, frontotemporal dementia is seen Fig. 2 The AAO varied with changes in the severity of TBI. The AAOs were compared among three groups of participants (none, mTBI, and sTBI). AAO age at onset, none participants without TBI, mTBI mild TBI, TBI moderate or severe TBI more often in those with TBI than in those without a TBI history [28, 29] . However, the manner by which TBI affects the risk for other types of dementia or cognitive impairment is beyond the scope of this study because it was performed in an MCI/AD cohort. In addition, this study did not control for other possible confounding factors that might affect the AAO of cognitive impairment as well such as alcoholism, hypertension, and stroke and type 2 diabetes mellitus [30] [31] [32] [33] . Our study demonstrated TBI as a risk factor associated with an earlier AAO of cognitive impairment. Even a history of mTBI was shown to significantly accelerate the AAO of cognitive impairment. Lastly, mTBI was shown to accelerate the AAO in patients with MCI. The cognitive symptoms seen in people with a TBI history may be associated with a common sequelae of head injury: namely depression [7, 34] , which was not investigated further in the current study. The quantification information regarding how TBI associates with an earlier AAO of cognitive impairment may be useful for clinicians to make a more accurate prognosis or take appropriate preventative or therapeutic measures for TBI patients. The roles of moderate or severe TBIs on cognition impairments are worthy to be studied with a larger sample in the future. Finally, the observed association between TBI and AAO of cognitive impairment needs further confirmation by studies investigating biomarker changes and studies assessing pathological changes at autopsy.\nAcknowledgments Data collection and sharing for this project was funded by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (National Institutes of Health Grant U01 AG024904) and DOD ADNI (Department of Defense award number W81XWH-12-2-0012).
