The 143 dataset 'UPENNBIOMK2' was used for ADNI 1 and 'UPENNBIOMK6' for ADNI 2 and ADNI GO. Both 144 datasets contain CSF measurements collected using the xMAP Luminex platform and Innogenetics im-145 munoassay kits. The CSF measures were dichotomized at the previously published threshold (192 pg/ml). we included these estimates as priors using a multivariate normal distribution (see Table 1 ). The PGRS had 174 a non-informative multivariate normal prior with mean 0 and variance 100. We also created models where 175 all variables had the non-informative Normal(0,100) priors for comparison. MCI is used as the reference diagnosis.\nAPOE status 1 (at least one 4 allele) is used as the reference level. Kruskal Wallis chi-squared was used to test between normal and abnormal groups for continuous demographic variables.\nFishers exact was used to test between normal and abnormal groups for categorical demographic variables.
