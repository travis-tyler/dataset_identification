[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "This report presents findings on crime and violence in U.S. public schools, 1 using data from the 2015-16 School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS:2016). First administered in school year 1999-2000 and repeated in school years 2003-04, 2005-06, 2007-08, 2009-10, and 2015-16, SSOCS provides information on school crime-related topics from the perspective of schools. Developed and managed by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) within the Institute of Education Sciences of the U.S. Department of Education and supported by the National Institute of Justice of the U.S. Department of Justice, SSOCS asks public school principals about the prevalence of violent and serious violent crimes in their schools. Portions of this survey also focus on school security measures, disciplinary problems and actions, school security staff, the availability of mental health services in schools, and the programs and policies implemented to prevent and reduce crime in schools. SSOCS:2016 is based on a nationally representative stratified random sample of 3,553 U.S. public schools. Data collection began on February 22, 2016, when questionnaires were mailed to principals, and continued through July 5, 2016. A total of 2,092 public primary, middle, high, and combined schools provided complete questionnaires, yielding a response rate of approximately 63 percent once the responding schools were weighted to account for their original sampling probabilities. Per NCES Statistical Standards, a unit nonresponse bias analysis was performed due to the weighted response rate being less than 85 percent. The results suggest the characteristics of nonresponding schools differed significantly from those of responding schools. However, the unit nonresponse bias analysis also provided evidence that the nonresponse weighting adjustments used for SSOCS:2016 removed the observed nonresponse bias in characteristics known for both respondents and nonrespondents. This suggests that the weighting adjustments likely mitigated nonresponse bias in the SSOCS:2016 survey estimates, although some bias may remain after adjustment. For more information about the methodology and design of SSOCS, including how response rates were calculated and the details of the nonresponse bias analysis, please see Appendix B: Methodology and Technical Notes in this report. Because the purpose of this report is to introduce new NCES data through the presentation of tables containing descriptive information, only selected findings are presented below. These findings have been chosen to demonstrate the range of information available when using SSOCS:2016 data rather than to discuss all of the observed differences. For a more detailed description of the variables presented in the tables, please see Appendix C: Description of Variables in this report. The tables in this report contain totals and percentages generated from bivariate crosstabulation procedures. All of the results are weighted to represent the population of U.S. public schools. The comparisons drawn in the bulleted items below have been tested for statistical significance at the .05 level using Student's t statistic to ensure that the differences are larger than those that might be expected due to sampling variation. Adjustments for multiple comparisons were not included. Many of the variables examined are related to one another, and complex interactions and relationships have not been explored. Due to the large sample size, many differences (no matter how substantively minor) are statistically significant; thus, only differences of 5 percentage points or more between groups are mentioned in the findings.

This percentage is higher than in schools with lower enrollments. For example, 8 percent of schools with enrollments of less than 300 students reported cyberbullying (table 5). \u2022 During the 2015-16 school year, 37 percent of disciplinary actions taken by schools in response to student involvement in the use or possession of a weapon other than a firearm or explosive device involved an out-of-school suspension of students lasting 5 or more days. In comparison, 18 percent of disciplinary actions involved the transfer of students to specialized schools, 4 percent of disciplinary actions involved the removal of students with no continuing services for at least the remainder of the school year, and 41 percent of disciplinary actions were classified as other (suspensions for less than 5 days, detention, etc.) (table 6). \u2022 Higher percentages of schools located in suburbs (74 percent) and cities (73 percent) reported they had a formal program intended to prevent or reduce violence that included social emotional learning training for students than did schools located in towns (62 percent) and rural areas (51 percent) (table 7). \u2022 Higher percentages of schools reported that they had drilled students on lockdown procedures (95 percent) and evacuation procedures (92 percent) compared with shelter-in-place procedures (76 percent) (table 8). \u2022 A higher percentage of schools in which 1,000 or more students were enrolled during the 2015-16 school year reported having one or more School Resource Officers present once a week (77 percent) than schools in which 500-999 students were enrolled (47 percent), schools in which 300-499 students were enrolled (36 percent), and schools in which less than 300 students were enrolled (24 percent) (table 9). \u2022 A lower percentage of schools located in cities (36 percent) reported that one or more sworn law enforcement officers routinely carried a firearm while at school during the 2015-16 school year than schools located in towns (57 percent) and suburbs (45 percent). The same pattern was observed for sworn law enforcement officers who carried stun guns and who carried chemical or aerosol sprays (table 10). \u2022 Among the factors that were reported to limit schools' efforts to reduce or prevent crime \"in a major way,\" three factors were more likely to be reported than others: a lack of, or inadequate, alternative placements or programs for disruptive students (30 percent); inadequate funds (28 percent); and federal, state, or district policies on disciplining special education students (17 percent) (table 11).

SSOCS is the only recurring federal survey collecting detailed information on the incidence, frequency, seriousness, and nature of violence affecting students and school personnel, as well as other indices of school safety. SSOCS collects extensive data from public school principals to provide information on crime and safety from the schools' perspective. Data from this collection can be used to examine the relationship between school characteristics and violent and serious violent crimes in primary schools, middle schools, high schools, and combined schools. In addition, data from SSOCS can be used to assess what crime prevention programs, practices, and policies are used by schools. SSOCS has been conducted six times, covering the 1999-2000, 2003-04, 2005-06, 2007-08, 2009-10, and 2015-16 school years. A seventh collection is planned for school year 2017-18. SSOCS was developed by NCES, and the first five administrations of the survey were funded by the Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools of the U.S. Department of Education. Funding for the 2015-16 SSOCS (SSOCS:2016) was supported by the National Institute of Justice through its Comprehensive School Safety Initiative, which was developed in response to a 2014 congressional appropriation to conduct research about school safety. The responsibility for the design and conduct of the survey continues to rest with NCES and the SSOCS:2016 data collection was administered by the U.S. Census Bureau. Data collection began on February 22, 2016, when questionnaire packets were mailed to sampled schools and continued through July 5, 2016. A total of 2,092 public schools submitted complete questionnaires: 516 primary schools, 719 middle schools, 774 high schools, and 83 combined schools."}, {"section_title": "Sample Design", "text": "The sampling frame for SSOCS:2016 was constructed using the 2013-14 Public Elementary/Secondary School Universe data file of the Common Core of Data (CCD), an annual data collection of all public K-12 schools and school districts. The SSOCS sampling frame was restricted to regular public schools in all 50 states and the District of Columbia (including charter schools). The objectives of the SSOCS sampling design are twofold: (1) to obtain overall cross-sectional and subgroup estimates of important indicators of school crime and safety and (2) to yield precise estimates of change in these indicators between 1999-2000, 2003-04, 2005-06, 2007-08, 2009-10, and 2015-16. To attain these objectives, a stratified sample of 3,553 regular public schools was drawn for SSOCS:2016. The same general sampling design-including stratification variables, number of strata, method of sample allocation, and sorting of variables before selection-was used for SSOCS:2016 as for the previous survey administrations. 1 The initial goal of SSOCS:2016 was to collect data from at least 2,550 schools. Because the majority of school violence is reported in middle and high schools, a larger proportion of the target respondent count of 2,550 schools was allocated to middle and high schools. The target respondent count was allocated to the four instructional levels as follows: 640 primary schools, 895 middle schools, 915 high schools, and 100 combined schools. Three variables that have been shown to be associated with school crime-school level, locale, and enrollment size-were used to create strata (i.e., groups) in SSOCS:2016, with the population of schools stratified into four school levels, 2 four locale categories, 3,4 and four enrollment size categories 5 (Neiman 2011; Chen and Weikart 2008;Langbein and Bess 2002;Miller 2004). The expected respondent count within each school level was allocated to each of the 16 cells formed by the cross-classification of the four categories of enrollment size and four categories of locale. The target number of responding schools allocated to each of the 16 cells was proportional to the sum of the square roots of the total student enrollment over all schools in the cell. The target respondent count within each stratum was then inflated to account for anticipated nonresponse; this inflated count was the sample size for the stratum. The strata were sorted by percent White, non-Hispanic enrollment, 6 region, 7 state, and school district, and a sample of 3,553 schools was selected using a systematic design, with a constant sampling rate in each stratum. For more information on the sample design, see the School Survey on Crime andSafety: 2015-16 Data File User's Manual (Jackson et al. 2017)."}, {"section_title": "Data Collection", "text": "SSOCS:2016 was conducted as a mail survey with telephone follow-up. Four months before the onset of data collection, the U.S. Census Bureau began working with school districts who require prior approval before allowing sampled schools in their district to participate in the survey. On February 18, 2016, the principals of the sampled schools were sent advance letters that included the date of the first questionnaire mailing and a toll-free number to call with any questions. Advance letters were also mailed to Chief State School Officers and Superintendents to notify them about the survey and to request that they encourage schools under their purview to participate. On February 22, 2016, questionnaires were sent via private delivery service directly to the principals of the sampled schools, with a cover letter describing the importance of the survey and a promotional SSOCS pen. See Appendix D: 2015-16 School Survey on Crime and Safety Questionnaire for a copy of the SSOCS:2016 questionnaire. Three weeks after the initial mailout, a reminder telephone operation began. The primary objective of the reminder telephone operation was to follow up with the principal or school contact to determine the status of the questionnaire; however, the interviewer could complete the SSOCS interview over the phone at the respondent's request. Returned questionnaires were examined for quality and completeness using both manual and computerized edits. Where necessary, telephone follow-up was used to resolve discrepancies or missing data identified during editing. For a survey to be considered complete in SSOCS:2016, answers were required for at least 162 of the 296 total subitems eligible for recontact (i.e., all subitems in the questionnaire except those associated with the introductory items).

Items 26 and 35 (whose subitems were all categorized as critical) had additional completion criteria; responses were required for at least 18 of the 30 subitems within item 26 and at least 6 of the 25 subitems within item 35. Questionnaires that did not meet established completion criteria were considered incomplete and are excluded from the SSOCS:2016 data file. If a questionnaire that was considered to be complete at the end of data collection contained missing values, the missing values were imputed, i.e., the missing values were replaced with estimates derived from data reported by schools with similar characteristics or from data available on the sampling frame. Data collection ended on July 5, 2016. More detailed information about the SSOCS:2016 data collection and data processing procedures can be found in the School Survey on Crime andSafety: 2015-16 Data File User's Manual (Jackson et al. 2017)."}, {"section_title": "Weighting", "text": "Sample weights allow inferences to be made about the population from which the sample units were drawn. Due to the complex nature of the SSOCS:2016 sample design, weights are necessary to obtain population-based estimates, to minimize bias arising from differences between responding and nonresponding schools, and to calibrate the data to known population characteristics in a way that reduces sampling error. The procedures used to create the SSOCS:2016 sampling weights are described below. Each school was assigned an initial (base) weight equal to the ratio of the number of schools available in the sampling frame in the school's stratum to the number of schools sampled from the school's stratum. In other words, a school's base weight was equal to the inverse of the sampling rate within its stratum. The weights were adjusted to correct for nonresponse by multiplying each school's base weight by the inverse of the response rate within the school's adjustment cell. Adjustment cells were defined using variables available in the sampling frame. A Chi-Squared Interaction Detection (CHAID) analysis, which automatically identifies variables predictive of response, was used to define the adjustment cells. The CHAID analysis identified the following variables as being predictive of response: school locale, number of full-timeequivalent teachers, school level, region, percent White, non-Hispanic enrollment, enrollment size, student-to-teacher ratio, and percent of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. Variables that are predictive of response are likely to be sources of nonresponse bias. These variables were therefore used to define the weighting adjustment cells. The nonresponse adjustments allowed the weighted distribution of the responding schools to resemble the initial distribution of the total sample (see the section below on nonresponse bias analysis). The nonresponse-adjusted weights were then raked to agree with known population counts, which were obtained from the sampling frame, by school level, enrollment size, and locale. This step helps to reduce bias in the estimates due to nonresponse and/or undercoverage, and may improve the precision of some estimates. The three variables used for raking (i.e., school level, enrollment size, and locale) have been shown to be correlated with school crime (Neiman 2011;Chen and Weikart 2008;Langbein and Bess 2002;Miller 2004)."}, {"section_title": "Unit Response Rates", "text": "A unit response rate is, at its most basic level, the ratio of surveys completed by eligible respondents to the total count of eligible respondents using the base weights (i.e., prior to nonresponse adjustments). Unit response rates are traditionally reported because they reflect the potential effects of nonsampling error and indicate whether portions of the population are underrepresented due to nonresponse. In order to calculate any of these measures, it is first necessary to know the disposition (outcome) of each sampled case. Table B-1 shows the dispositions of the 3,553 cases selected for participation in SSOCS:2016, as well as the unweighted and weighted unit response rates by selected school characteristics. 8 The overall weighted 9 unit response rate was 62.9 percent."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Unit Nonresponse Bias", "text": "The existence of nonresponding schools has the potential to introduce bias into survey estimates, depending on the magnitude of the nonresponse and whether differences exist between responding and nonresponding schools in characteristics related to the estimates of interest. Because NCES Statistical Standard 4-4 requires analysis of nonresponse bias for any survey stage with a base-weighted unit response rate less than 85 percent, a nonresponse bias analysis was conducted to evaluate the extent of this bias in SSOCS:2016 (U.S. Department of Education 2014). Comparisons of the sample and target population, respondents and nonrespondents, and relative response probability across frame variable categories were examined to identify potential sources of bias. The variables used in the unit nonresponse bias analysis were school locale, number of full-time-equivalent teachers, school level, region, percent White, non-Hispanic enrollment, enrollment size, student-to-teacher ratio, and percent of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. These variables are available for all U.S. public schools from the CCD, and thus were known for all schools sampled for SSOCS:2016 regardless of whether they responded. For such characteristics, bias can be measured directly. The analysis found that, based on these characteristics, there were significant differences between responding and nonresponding schools. For example, schools with an enrollment of 1,000 students or more, urban schools, and schools in which less than 50 percent of students are White, non-Hispanic were significantly underrepresented among respondents, relative to their share of the target population. To provide a fuller picture of the risk of bias in key estimates, correlations between these frame characteristics and survey variables were analyzed, and key estimates were compared between the lowest propensity respondents (i.e. schools with characteristics resembling those of nonrespondents) and other respondents. The frame characteristics (which are known for both respondents and nonrespondents) were found to be correlated with a number of survey variables (which are known only for respondents). This implies that the observed bias in frame characteristics, if not adjusted for, would likely lead to bias in key SSOCS:2016 estimates. A CHAID analysis was conducted to inform the selection of weighting classes to be used to produce nonresponse-adjusted weights. Based on the CHAID analysis, the base weights were adjusted for potential nonresponse bias in school level, locale, enrollment size, percent White, non-Hispanic enrollment, region, percent of students eligible for free lunch, pupil-teacher ratio, and the number of FTE teaching staff. When the nonresponse-adjusted weights were applied, no significant bias remained in any of these characteristics. Because these characteristics are known to be correlated with survey variables, this suggests that the weighting adjustments incorporated into the SSOCS:2016 weights help to mitigate nonresponse bias in key estimates. However, some estimates may be subject to nonresponse bias that is not related to the observable characteristics used to create nonresponse-adjusted weights. This type of bias would not be removed by weighting adjustments. Therefore, data users are cautioned that, because survey variables are not observed for nonrespondents, the exact amount of nonresponse bias remaining in key estimates cannot be known with certainty and is likely to vary between estimates. For more information on the analysis of unit nonresponse, please see the School Survey on Crime andSafety: 2015-16 Data File User's Manual (Jackson et al. 2017). For a survey to be considered complete in SSOCS:2016, answers were required for at least 162 of the 296 total subitems eligible for recontact (i.e., all subitems in the questionnaire except those associated with the introductory items). Of the 296 total subitems, 92 were categorized as critical and respondents were required to provide answers for at least 75. Responses provided to the critical subitems counted toward the total 162 subitem responses needed for a survey to be considered complete. Items 26 and 35 (whose subitems were all categorized as critical) had additional completion criteria; respondents had to provide responses for at least 18 of the 30 subitems within item 26 and at least 6 of the 25 subitems within item 35. Questionnaires that did not meet established completion criteria were considered incomplete and are excluded from the SSOCS:2016 data file. 2 Nonrespondents include schools whose districts denied permission to NCES and those eligible schools that either did not respond or responded but did not answer the minimum number of items required for the survey to be considered complete. 3 Ineligible schools include those that had closed, merged with another school at a new location, changed from a regular public school to an alternative school, or are not a school: \"not a school\" generally refers to a school record for an organization that does not provide any classroom instruction (e.g., an office overseeing a certain type of program or offering only tutoring services). 4 The weighted response rate is calculated by applying the inverse of the probability of selection (including the sampling adjustment factor) to the calculation of the unweighted response rate. 5 Primary schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not higher than grade 3 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 8. Middle schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 4 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 9. High schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 9 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 12. Combined schools include all other combinations of grades, including K-12 schools.

Weighted item response rates are calculated in the same way by weighting each school by the inverse of its probability of selection.

This analysis was done because differences between the schools that did and did not respond to an item can lead to bias in estimates. The magnitude of item nonresponse bias for a particular item is determined by the following factors: the level of item response, the differences between item respondents and item nonrespondents in the characteristic being measured by the item, and the distribution of item responses across categories of auxiliary variables. Two survey subitems out of 273 subitems examined in this analysis (C0326 and C0330) had a weighted item response rate lower than 85 percent. These subitems were examined for potential bias per NCES standards. Using extreme assumptions for imputation, both were sensitive to the potential effects of nonresponse bias. Distributions of two survey subitems and eight sampling frame variables were compared between respondents and nonrespondents to subitems C0326 and C0330. Survey subitems C0560 (perceived level of crime in students' neighborhood) and C0562 (perceived level of crime in the school's neighborhood), which are likely to be correlated with responses to critical items, have high item response rates. Sub-items C0560 and C0562 both had weighted item response rates above 99 percent. The eight sampling frame variables used in the analysis were school locale, number of full-time-equivalent teachers, school level, region, percent White, non-Hispanic enrollment, enrollment size, student-to-teacher ratio, and percent of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. Results of the analyses indicated that the potential for bias was not enough to warrant the exclusion of C0326 and C0330 from the data file.

Another problem with missing data is that certain groups of respondents may be more likely than others to leave some survey items unanswered, creating bias in the survey estimates. When completed SSOCS:2016 surveys contained some level of item nonresponse after the conclusion of the data collection phase, imputation procedures were used to create values for all questionnaire items with missing information. The imputation methods utilized in SSOCS:2016 were tailored to the nature of the survey item. Three methods were used: aggregate proportions, best match, and clerical.

The sources of nonsampling errors are typically problems such as unit and item nonresponse, the differences in respondents' interpretations of the meaning of survey questions, response differences related to the particular month or time of the year when the survey was conducted, the tendency for respondents to give socially desirable responses, and mistakes in data preparation. In general, it is difficult to identify and estimate either the amount of nonsampling error or the bias caused by this error. For SSOCS, efforts were made to prevent such errors from occurring and to compensate for them, where possible. For instance, during the survey design phase, cognitive testing of the new and revised questionnaire items was conducted with public school principals or the person most knowledgeable about school crime and policies to provide a safe environment in their school. Cognitive testing provided the opportunity to check for consistency of interpretation of questions and definitions as well as to eliminate ambiguous items. The questionnaire items were also extensively reviewed by NCES, a technical review panel consisting of some of the nation's top experts on school crime, and the National Institute of Justice, a partner federal agency who contributed funding for SSOCS:2016. In addition, extensive editing of the questionnaire responses was conducted to check the data for accuracy and consistency.
