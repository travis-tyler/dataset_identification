Methods: Thirty-four older adults, including 19 cognitively normal (CN), 10 subjective cognitive decline (SCD), and 5 mild cognitive impairment, underwent amyloid positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). Twenty-six also underwent tau positron emission tomography. Associations between the UPSIT and regionally sampled amyloid, tau, and temporal atrophy were evaluated. Voxel-wise regression models were also utilized. Analyses were conducted with the full sample and only CN/SCD. Results: Lower UPSIT scores were associated with increased temporal and parietal tau burden in regional and voxel-wise analyses in the full sample and in CN and SCD only. Temporal lobe atrophy was associated with lower UPSIT score. Amyloid was not associated with the UPSIT.

In addition to the dementia syndrome of AD and the more limited amnestic deficits typical of its prodromal stage, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [2] , changes in sensory function have also been reported. Olfactory identification (the ability to correctly identify a smell) is impaired in AD and MCI, as well as in patients with Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Furthermore, olfactory identification measured using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) is sensitive to predicting future conversion from MCI to AD and even future cognitive decline in cognitively normal (CN) older adults and Parkinson's patients [4, [11] [12] [13] [14] .\nThe precise biological correlates of the observed changes in olfactory identification have not been specifically identified. However, previous studies have sought to determine the impact of the two major pathophysiological hallmarks of AD, amyloid b plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles, on olfaction in animal models of AD [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] , autopsy studies [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] , and more recently in living human beings using imaging biomarkers of amyloid pathology, measured using neuroimaging with positron emission tomography (PET) techniques [30] [31] [32] . Animal models of AD show considerable olfactory deficits that are related to the deposition of amyloid and tau in the olfactory bulb and throughout the olfactory network [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] 33] . In human autopsy studies, amyloid and tau, as well as other pathologies such as progranulin and TDP-43 deposition, are found in the olfactory bulb and throughout the olfactory network (including temporal piriform cortex) in patients with AD and other neurodegenerative diseases, and levels of amyloid and tau deposition are associated with the level of olfactory deficits [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] 34] . The associations of UPSIT performance with neurodegeneration and brain function, measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or [ 15 O]H 2 O PET, have also been investigated [4, 14, 31, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . In vivo imaging studies have shown weak associations between amyloid and olfactory impairments [30] [31] [32] . However, more significant relationships between olfactory impairment and atrophy are apparent in olfactory-related regions (amygdala, piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex, etc.) in MCI and AD patients, as well as amyloid-positive CN older adults [4, 14, 31, 32, 36, 38, 40] . Impaired olfactory identification on the UPSIT was also correlated with white matter degeneration in the splenium of the corpus callosum and superior longitudinal fasciculus, as measured with diffusion tensor imaging [38] . Schofield et al. (2012) also showed that poorer recovery on the UPSIT after cholinergic challenge with atropine was associated with a lower hippocampal volume in MCI and AD dementia patients [37] . Furthermore, in vivo activation of the primary olfactory cortex is reduced in patients with MCI and AD [35, 40, 41] . Despite the evidence for relationships between olfaction and amyloid, structural, and functional markers in AD, there are no in vivo assessments of the relationship between olfactory identification and tau deposition, likely due to the lack of an in vivo marker for tau until recently.\nNew , and neurodegeneration (structural MRI). Our cohort included CN older adults without significant cognitive concerns, older adults with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), and patients with MCI. Previous literature examining in vivo imaging has suggested a strong association of UPSIT performance and neurodegeneration on MRI, but a weaker association with amyloid deposition. Thus, we hypothesized that impairments on the UPSIT would be associated with tau deposition and neurodegeneration (gray matter [GM] loss) in regions involved in olfactory processing (i.e., medial temporal lobe) but show less of an association with cortical amyloid deposition."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Thirty-four older adults (age 551 years) were recruited from the Indiana Alzheimer Disease Center to undergo advanced PET and MRI neuroimaging and sensory testing. UPSIT administration was performed as previously described, with UPSIT total score being the primary outcome measure of olfactory identification (maximum score 5 40; higher scores reflect better performance) [43] . Individuals with a history of a broken nose, severe allergies, or who were currently experiencing an upper respiratory infection, as well as those who were unable to undergo MRI or PET imaging were excluded. Five participants were diagnosed with MCI using previously established guidelines. Briefly, MCI participants had a significant complaint about their cognition from themselves and/or an informant or a clinician, as well as a significant deficit (.1.5 standard deviation below normal) in either memory or another cognitive domain [2] . Ten individuals were characterized as SCD according to the following criteria: elevated levels of subjective memory concerns on the 20-item Cognitive Change Index (CCI-20) reflected as a score of 20 or more on the first 12 items, with or without increased levels of informant-based concerns [44] and without a measurable cognitive deficit. Nineteen older adults without significant memory concerns (12-item CCI total ,20) and without measurable cognitive deficit were considered CN.

Using SPM8, the middle four 5-minute frames (80-100 minutes) were motion corrected, normalized to MNI space, averaged to create an 80-to 100-minute static image, smoothed with an 8-mm full-width half maximum gaussian kernel, and intensity normalized to the cerebellar crus to create SUVR images."}, {"section_title": "Amyloid PET", "text": "ROIs for target regions were generated from subjectspecific parcellations from FreeSurfer v5.1, and [ 18 F]Flortaucipir SUVR for each region was extracted from the SUVR images.

Neuroimaging target variables were preadjusted to remove the effects of age, sex, and total intracranial volume as appropriate. Briefly, a linear regression model including sex and age (for UPSIT total, amyloid centiloid data, and tau SUVR) or including sex, age, and intracranial volume (for MRI variables) were calculated using CN and SCD individuals only (\"CN/SCD subsample\"). The resulting bcoefficients were used to calculate residuals of the target variables for all participants (\"preadjusted\"). Then, associations between the preadjusted (residual) UPSIT total score and the preadjusted (residual) metrics of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration were assessed using Pearson correlation models.

We found that tau deposition and atrophy in the temporal lobe, but not amyloid deposition, were associated with lower olfactory identification (UPSIT total score) across a population of CN individuals and older adults with SCD or MCI. We observed a similar phenomenon in the subset of individuals without measured cognitive impairment (CN/SCD subsample), with negative correlations between tau in the temporal lobe and lower UPSIT performance. There were no associations between UPSIT total score and amyloid or neurodegeneration in this subpopulation. Finally, exploratory voxel-wise analyses in both the full sample and in the CN/SCD subsample confirmed the regional findings and also suggested that parietal, occipital, and frontal lobe have correlations between higher tau and lower olfactory identification.\nAlthough prior studies have shown that olfactory processing is related to more general evidence of cerebral integrity (e.g., GM loss), these observed relationships between tau and olfactory identification provide new evidence that poor performance on an olfactory identification test may be linked to specific ongoing pathophysiology in AD. In MCI, tau and neurodegeneration are often found in areas that are involved in olfactory processing, which may result in the observable olfactory loss, as suggested by the strong negative correlation between UPSIT performance and both tau and neurodegeneration when MCI patients were included in the analysis. However, when MCI patients were excluded, only an association with tau, but not neurodegeneration (GM loss), was seen. This suggests that early changes in UPSIT performance in at-risk CN individuals may be indicative of active tau deposition in the brain before significant atrophy. These findings support the use of the UP-SIT as a biomarker of early presymptomatic disease. Our results support previous imaging studies that found a strong significant relationship between olfactory impairment and neurodegeneration and a relatively weaker correlation with amyloid. For example, Bahar-Fuchs et al. reported a significant negative association of the UPSIT with amyloid deposition, but only across (not within) diagnostic groups, and concluded that the UPSIT impairment was due diagnostic differences rather than directly to amyloid deposition [30] . Consistent with this interpretation, we propose that tau deposition in medial temporal and other primary olfactoryrelated regions may be the main cause of the olfactory deficits seen in MCI, as well as in at-risk individuals such as those with SCD. Tau deposition may lead to neurodegeneration in these regions over time, in turn resulting in the observed association between olfactory deficits and atrophy in the MCI stages. Given that we observed an association between tau, but not atrophy, and UPSIT performance in the CN individuals with and without complaints, we suggest that tau is the primary driver of the early olfactory identification deficits.\nNumerous studies have found amyloid and tau deposition in the olfactory bulbs of humans at autopsy and in AD animal models [15, 16, 20, [22] [23] [24] 27, 28] . PET does not offer sufficient resolution for measurement of amyloid and/or tau deposition in the olfactory bulb in humans. However, future PET studies of amyloid and tau in conjunction with olfactory mucosa sampling [50] may help to determine whether the primary olfactory system has amyloid and tau deposition that mirrors that seen in the brain.\nThis study has a few important limitations. The sample size is relatively small, particularly for the MCI population, necessitating larger future studies for replication and , reduced preadjusted UPSIT total score was associated with increased tau in the medial and lateral temporal lobes, as well as throughout the inferior, middle, and superior frontal lobes. No associations were seen in the opposite direction (i.e., increased tau associated with better UPSIT score). Voxel-wise association are shown at a voxel-wise threshold of P , .01 (uncorrected for multiple comparisons) and minimum cluster size (k) 5 100 voxels. Abbreviations: CN, cognitively normal; MCI, mild cognitive impairment; SCD, subjective cognitive decline; UPSIT, University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test. extension of the findings. In this study, we only included amyloid and tau PET imaging and structural MRI. Future studies incorporating resting-state fMRI or even task-based fMRI of olfactory response could help to further describe the early changes in olfaction in those at risk for AD. Finally, the small number of amyloid-positive individuals in our study may have limited our ability to detect amyloidrelated association with olfactory performance (Table 1) . However, when we limited the sample to only those who were amyloid positive or borderline amyloid positive, a very strong association between the UPSIT total score and tau deposition was observed (data not shown); in amyloidnegative participants, no association between the UPSIT total score and tau was observed (data not shown) in the full sample. These findings suggest that tau deposition in the presence of amyloid may be driving the observed associations. However, effects of other neurodegenerative conditions resulting in tau accumulation and/or neurodegeneration may result in impairment on the UPSIT, as has been previously observed in Parkinson's disease and other degenerative conditions. Future studies with larger samples of amyloid-negative and amyloid-positive individuals, along with tau PET imaging, will help to further clarify this issue.\nIn summary, we observed significant associations between tau deposition in medial and lateral temporal regions and performance deficits on a measure of olfactory identification. These associations were observed across CN, SCD, and MCI individuals, as well as within CN and SCD only. Associations between olfactory identification and temporal lobe atrophy were observed in the full sample only (CN 1 SCD 1 MCI); there were no associations observed with amyloid deposition in either the full sample or the CN/ SCD subsample. These results suggest that measures of olfactory identification may be sensitive biomarkers of concurrent tau deposition. In turn, these behavioral tests, which are inexpensive and are easy and quick to administer in primary care settings, could be useful for identifying individuals at risk for the development of AD."}]
