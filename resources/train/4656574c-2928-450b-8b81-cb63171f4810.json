Like other standards-based instructional reforms, the Common Core is an attempt to influence the behavior of actors who retain considerable discretion over their professional activities and who may find change difficult -classroom teachers (Spillane 2009 ). To implement instructional standards educators must make sense of standards, think reflexively about their own practice, and develop and use new instructional strategies that align with the standards (Coburn 2004 (Coburn , 2005 . As this sense-making process unfolds in classrooms across the country, thousands of teachers are currently determining whether and how the Common Core will change public schooling in the United States.\nInstructional specialists --district-level employees who coordinate textbook adoptions, develop curricula, and provide professional development and instructional coaching for teachers --play an important intermediary role in this sense-making process. Typically veteran teachers with considerable expertise in a particular content or instructional domain (i.e. primary English language arts; secondary mathematics; second-language acquisition), specialists are street-level bureaucrats (Lipsky 1983 ) who help construct standards-based educational policy as they work with teachers to bring standards to the classroom. Instructional specialists actively shape and reshape standards as they facilitate their interpretation and help teachers develop new standardsaligned classroom strategies (Coburn and Woulfin 2012) . . Over the last two years, when we asked Instructional Specialists in Southern California to describe their professional role, nearly all invoked the Common Core. One specialist told us \"my job is to become an expert in the Common Core, or at least to try to become an expert;\" others discussed identifying Common Core-aligned curricula, preparing teachers to take the standards into the classroom, developing new lessons, and helping parents and community members understand the standards. (See the Appendix for details on this qualitative data.)\nGiven their role in translating standards to the classroom, it is notable that the ranks of instructional specialists have grown during the era of standards-based educational policy. Table 1 reports trends in instructional specialist staffing for U.S. public school districts, as reported in the National Center of Education Statistics annual Common Core of Data. In 1997-98, the average US public school student was enrolled in a district that employed approximately 0.7 instructional specialists for every 1,000 students and nearly 20 percent of US students enrolled in a district that employed no instructional specialists. In the intervening 15 years, the rate of instructional specialist staffing rate more than doubled, to 1.41 specialists per 1,000 students. By 2012-13, just 7 percent of US students were enrolled in districts that employed no instructional specialists. Notably, this growth in instructional specialist staffing occurred in a period in which other aspects of school district staffing remained relatively constant. As Table 1 indicates, the number of teachers per 1,000 students in US public schools grew by less than 5 percent during this period, while the number of administrators per 1,000 students in US public schools grew by approximately 20 percent. Table 1 AROUND HERE] Instructional specialists are also unevenly distributed. Figure 1 represents the distribution of instructional specialist staffing for U.S. public school districts in each of the last 15 years, weighted by student enrollment. It demonstrates that the occupation's growth has been driven in particular by districts that employ a large number of specialists. As the dark line at the center of the boxes illustrates, the median ratio of specialists to 1,000 students grew over the study period by approximately 60 percent (from 0.52 to 0.82). More striking, however, is the growth in instructional specialist staffing at the top of the distribution. At the 75 th percentile, the specialist ratio doubled to nearly 2 per 1,000 students; at the 95 th percentile, this ratio increased to nearly 5."}, {"section_title": "[INSERT", "text": "[INSERT Figure 1 AROUND HERE]\nSupplementary analyses reported in the Appendix indicate that instructional specialist staffing has grown particularly rapidly in high-minority and high-poverty districts. Today, districts with large proportions of Black and Hispanic students as well as districts with large proportions of students who qualify for free and reduced price lunch are over-represented at the top of the instructional specialist distribution. State policy also plays a role. While instructional specialist staffing increased between 1998 and 2013 in all but 2 U.S. states for which longitudinal data are available, both the level of staffing and the ratio of change varies at the state level. 2 California, for example, appropriated generous funds to districts to facilitate CCSS implementation in 2010. The state now leads the nation in instructional specialist staffing, with more than three times the national average.\nThese recent trends raise important questions about the development of the instructional specialist role and what it will mean for the future of American public education. We highlight two implications for future research. First, although specialists make up a relatively small portion of the overall educational workforce, there is reason to believe that this emerging role may play an outsized role in the how standards-based policies are enacted in the classroom. The emergence of a new professional niche devoted to interpreting broad policy requirements is not merely a consequence of an ambitious initiatives; these professionals can fundamentally shape 1 US public school districts have witnessed some degree of demographic change over the last 15 years, as the proportion of poor and Hispanic students increased. However, it seems unlikely that these demographic changes have driven the nationwide increase in instructional specialist staffing in American public schools, and supplementary analyses indicate that the observed growth in instructional specialist staffing is robust to controls for changes in district-level student demographics. 2 Instructional specialist staffing remained virtually unchanged over the study period in Florida and Pennsylvania. At any given time point, state effects explain approximately forty percent of the variance we observe across districts in instructional specialist staffing. However, state effects explain only approximately two percent of the variation in staffing change across the time series.\nhow that policy is enacted (Dobbin 2009 Source: Public releases of NCES Common Core of Data (CCD). All estimates are weighted by districts' total student enrollment.\nEstimates exclude districts that failed to report data in CCD districts surveys in three or more years during the time series; as well as all districts in Alaska, New Hampshire, and Virginia which consistently reported out-of-range values for staffing data.

The CCD data count instructional specialists as a distinct category from district administrators.\nBased on these staffing reports, we calculate measures of the number of instructional specialists, teachers, and administrators per 1,000 students enrolled in each participating district. 8 We also draw upon district reports of total district expenditures; 9 the proportion of students who 7 This definition of the specialist role includes district employees, such as technology specialists and Title I coordinators who are not involved in the process of sense-making around instructional standards. However, an assessment of staffing in the districts in which we interviewed specialists indicates that nearly all specialists are involved in curriculum and instruction. In addition, the California experience (in which stark increases in specialist staffing coincides with a state initiative to bolster Common Core implementation) supports the notion that this measure is sensitive to changes in sense-making positions relating to instructional standards. 8 Calculated as (n staff/n students)*1000. To avoid distortions due to measurement error, our analyses eliminate districts that reported instructional specialist staffing greater than 10 specialists per 1,000 students, on the assumption that these reports are miscoded. Doing so sets fewer than 1 percent of observed districts to missing. Eliminating these outlying districts arguably imposes a conservative bias on our findings. Analyses including the outlying districts point to even more rapid growth in the mean number of specialists per 1,000 students. \nIn which Yij is the number of instructional specialists a district i employs per 1,000 students in year j; j is a matrix of indicator variables representing each of the years in the sample period;\nRaceij is a standardized measure of the proportion of student in district i who were Black or Hispanic in year j, Povertyij is a standardized measure of the proportion of students in district i who qualify for free or reduced lunch in year j; Enrollij is a standardized measure of the total enrollment in district i in year j; Expendij-1 is a standardized and inflation-adjusted measure of district i's total reported expenditures in year j-1; Ui is a district-level random effects term; and ij is an error term.\nModel 1 in Appendix Table 1 suggests that districts that enroll larger minority populations, more poor students, and districts with relatively high levels of per-student funding\nSince staffing contributes directly to expenditures in any given year, all analyses used the lagged value of district expenditures although results are robust to the use of current-year expenditures.\ntend to employ instructional specialists at a greater rate. Further, the estimates suggest that the time trends that we describe in the main manuscript are independent of changes in district demographics and school expenditures.\nModel 2 in Appendix Table 1 adds state fixed effects to shed light on the extent to which instructional specialist staffing patterns vary across states. While the inclusion of state fixed effects does not substantively change either the direction or the magnitude of the time trends, this model indicates that states explain a large proportion of the variation in district instructional specialist staffing.\nAppendix Table 2 reports logistic regression coefficients representing the relation between districts' demographics and expenditures and their odds of employing large numbers of instructional specialists. The dependent variable in this table's Model 1 is an indicator variable flagging districts that employ two or more specialists per 1,000 students; the dependent variable in Model 2 is an indicator variable flagging districts that employ four or more specialists per 1,000 students. Both models suggest that the relation between districts' minority student enrollment and their odds of having high levels of instructional specialist staffing is high. Highpoverty districts also have significantly higher odds of employing more than two specialists per 1,000 students."}, {"section_title": "Qualitative Data", "text": "We supplement these quantitative analyses with data gleaned from conversations with a convenience sample of approximately 20 mathematics instructional specialists working in several southern California public school districts between 2013 and 2015. The qualitative work is part of a larger project investigating how instruction and placement in middle school mathematics is changing as school implement in the Common Core. Our sample includes specialists that we contacted via employee directories as well as specialists we met while attending informal monthly meetings in which specialists meet at district offices throughout the region to network and discuss a broad array of curricular and professional issues. The sample includes specialists at a nine districts located in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Diego counties. The sample includes specialists in affluent suburban districts and high-poverty urban districts. The smallest districts in our sample enroll approximately 20,000 students; the largest enroll approximately 60,000 students.\nIn one-on-one interviews lasting approximately one hour, we ask specialists to describe their professional background and training, their professional goals, their conception of their professional role, district policies and practices relevant to their professional role, the sources information that inform their work, and the strategies that they use on the job. These interviews are audio recorded and transcribed with specialists' consent; when audio recordings are unavailable, we reconstruct conversations via detailed field notes recorded during interviews and compiled immediately after their conclusion.\nWhen we ask specialists to describe their role, nearly all invoke the new standards.\nAccording to one specialist, \"my job is to become an expert in the Common Core, or at least to try to become an expert.\" To do so, the specialists that we talked to routinely attend content areas meetings organized by content area professional organizations and other non-profit organizations as well as state and county departments of education. Further, many specialists invest considerable time and energy in the developing professional networks, both via face-to-face networking sessions (like those that our research team regularly observed) and social media.\nHaving developed expertise in the standards, the instructional specialists that we talked with work with administrators and teachers to help implement them in the classroom. Asked to list the strategies she uses to facilitate Common Core, one specialist lists: \"Professional development, strengthening site-based instructional leadership, instructional support through TOSA office.\" Others emphasize identifying textbooks and curricula that are Common Core aligned and working with teacher leaders to develop pacing guides and lesson plans for teachers to use.\nBut all of the specialists in our sample emphasize that the process is two-directional. One specialist tells us: \"\"I don't like to make a decision by myself. I get the data, put together a leadership team, lay out the options, and help them talk it out. That way, they aren't saying 'district told us to we have to'.\" A second explains: \"I think Common Core is attempting to deepen learning and teaching. People are talking about it like it's something that you can buy of the shelf. But it's not. Common Core is just furthering our effort to improve instruction (rather than a new curriculum). This isn't just a one year thing. It's a major shift in practice. That's going to take time.\" A third specialist tells us, \"Common Core is forcing us to pay close attention to instruction.\" Together with her district's teachers, this specialist is developing \"new lessons that are going to be teacher-created and classroom-refined.
