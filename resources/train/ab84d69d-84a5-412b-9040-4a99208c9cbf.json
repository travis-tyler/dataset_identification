Four hundred ninety-four healthy adults (age range: 19-80 years; Males = 187) were recruited and completed two multi-modal MRI scan sessions at the Brain Imaging Center of Southwest University, Chongqing, China. The goals of the dataset are to give researchers the opportunity to map the developmental trajectories of structural and functional changes in the human brain and to replicate previous findings. "}, {"section_title": "Background & Summary", "text": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become one of the most dominant techniques to investigate the human brain because it permits detailed, noninvasive and safe assessments of the human brain. MRI is also able to perform data collection using various imaging modalities, such as structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). In particular, these imaging measurements have been effectively used to capture structural and functional brain changes during development 1 , ageing 2 , psychiatric disorders 3 , etc. For example, the feature of restingstate functional connectivity can predict the maturity of the individual across development 4 and can be used as a \"fingerprint\" to identify individuals 5 . Thus, the measurements of MRI have made great contributions as imaging biomarkers of normal development, ageing, clinical diagnosis and therapeutic assessments.\nOne of the most urgent scientific issues confronting us in the 21 st century is how we can maintain a healthy mind for human life. In addition to focusing on uncovering the developmental course by which an original brain transforms into a mature one, another critical question in lifespan developmental neuroscience is how the brain changes as a function of ageing. There is a necessity to answer this question because we can only reveal the mechanism underlying healthy brain ageing if we can discover the causes of brain diseases related to ageing (e.g., Alzheimer's disease). Based on the measurements from various image modalities, researchers have uncovered many appealing findings in the normal ageing brain. For example, most brain regions follow a linear decline in grey matter volume (GMV) with normal ageing, while nonlinear age trajectories have also been observed in some regions (e.g., the medial temporal lobe), which indicated a preservation of GMV during the early adult lifespan 6 ; increasing age was found to be accompanied by decreasing functional segregation of brain systems, and this age-related effect was more prominent in associative systems than in sensory and motor systems 7 . For the sake of characterizing age-related changes in cognition, as well as in brain structure and function, the data repository for the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) initial study cohort has provided a multimodal dataset from a large, cross-sectional adult lifespan populationbased sample 8 . In addition, there are a number of datasets that are publicly available for free for authorized investigators, such as the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/) datasets. OASIS consists of a cross-sectional collection of 416 subjects aged 18 to 96 and a longitudinal MRI Data collection from 150 subjects aged 60 to 96 (http://www.oasis-brains.org/). However, there is still a lack of open access datasets that expand beyond the Caucasian white population, which would allow researchers to discover meaningful regulators of normal brain ageing or to verify previous findings. Moreover, revelations of age-related changes in the human brain should be based on large continuous samples, which, in a way, limit research activities in ageing. Thus, an additional open access normal adult lifespan dataset consisting of a large sample is needed for researchers who are interested in this domain or who require an independent dataset for cross-validation. Here, we describe the data generated in the Southwest University Adult Lifespan Dataset (SALD), which is one part of our ongoing project to examine the associations among brain imaging, creativity and mental health (BCM). The SALD comprises a large cross-sectional sample (total scans = 494; age span = 19-80 years) and a multi-modal (sMRI and rs-fMRI) investigation of these neural underpinnings. The goal of the SALD is to understand what a normal brain looks like and how it structurally and functionally changes at each decade of life from age 20 through age 80. Currently, it is available for research through the International Data-sharing Initiative. We hope our free data sharing can hasten the progress of normal brain ageing studies."}, {"section_title": "Methods Participants", "text": "The 494 participants (308 Females, 187 Males, aged 19 to 80 years) included in the release were selected from a large dataset of individuals who participated in the ongoing BCM data collection initiative. The young adults (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) of the lifespan sample were enrolled as college students at Southwest University in Chongqing, China. The university enrols 10,000 ordinary undergraduates each year, nearly 65% of who are female. The young adults were collected by random sampling from Southwest University; thus, the number of young females (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) is larger in our dataset (for more details, see Fig. 1 ). Many of the middle-aged adults (age 26 to 40 years) were recruited directly from staff at Southwest University. The rest of the participants in the adult sample were recruited from communities close to the university campus. The data collection was initiated in 2010 and was terminated in 2015. In addition, a part of the participants served as a control sample in a case-controlled study of a clinical population. Some participants were excluded due to sleeping during scanning. We primarily recruited participants through leaflets, online advertisements, and face-to-face propaganda. The exclusion criteria included the following: (1) MRI-related exclusion criteria, which included claustrophobia, metallic implants, Meniere's Syndrome and a history of fainting within the previous 6 months; (2) current psychiatric disorders or neurological disorders; (3) use of psychiatric drugs within the three months prior to scanning; (4) pregnancy; or (5) a history of head trauma. Informed written consent was obtained from each participant. In addition, we required the participants to refrain from drinking the day before the scanning and the day of the scanning.

Each participant took part in 3D structural MRI and resting-state fMRI scans; only subgroups of the participants underwent a task-based fMRI scan (the task data are not part of this release). Additionally, to avoid the lasting effect of task-based fMRI on the resting-state fMRI, the resting-state scan was performed before a particular task. For each participant, the 3D structural MRI and resting-state sequences were acquired in succession within one session. The anatomical and resting-state date was collected with the following parameters.\n(1) 3D structural MRI. A magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence was used to acquire high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical images (repetition time = 1,900 ms, echo time = 2.52 ms, inversion time = 900 ms, flip angle = 90 degrees, resolution matrix = 256 \u00d7 256, slices = 176, thickness = 1.0 mm, and voxel size = 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm 3 ).\n(2) Resting-state fMRI.

The results revealed that no significant result was found in the relationship between mean framewise displacement (FD) and SNR (r = 0.055, P = 0.222). There was a significant and positive correlation that existed between the mean FD and age (r = 0.372, P o0.001), and this relationship strengthened (r = 0.455, P o0.001) after we removed 16 subjects who possessed the outlying mean FD values. Figure 4 indicates these two correlations. The results suggested that head motion may increase with age, and the head motion in this dataset did not significantly affect the overall quality of the images in a linear trend."}, {"section_title": "Replication of previous findings", "text": "To test whether this dataset was technically valid, we tried to use the current data to replicate some previous findings. Here, the sMRI and resting-state fMRI data were analysed based on this objective. "}, {"section_title": "3D structural MRI data", "text": "A large number of studies have reported that structural development during normal ageing is accompanied by a decline in the total grey matter volume [10] [11] [12] [13] ; in addition, cortical grey matter volume was found to decline throughout adulthood [14] [15] [16] . In addition, the decreases were always reported to be most pronounced in the frontal and parietal lobes 6, 14, 17, 18 . Here, we attempted to replicate these robust findings in the current dataset.\nThe sMRI (1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm 3 ) data were preprocessed using SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK; www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). For better registration, all T1-weighted structural images were automatically co-registered to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure (AC-PC) using an SPM8-based script. Then, a spatially adaptive non-local means (SANLM) denoising filter 19 was applied using the VBM8 toolbox (http://www.neuro.uni-jena.de/vbm/download/). Next, using the unified segmentation procedure, the co-registered images from each participant were segmented into grey matter (GM), white matter and cerebrospinal fluid 20 . The GM images of each participant were spatially normalized to a study-specific T1-weighted template using a diffeomorphic nonlinear registration algorithm (DARTEL; diffeomorphic anatomical registration through exponentiated lie algebra). The DARTEL registration involves the following: first, computing the specific template based on the average tissue probability maps from all the participants; and second, warping each participant's segmented maps to a specific template. To improve the alignment and to achieve a more accurate inter-subject registration, the procedure was repetitively conducted until the best study-specific template was generated. Subsequently, registered images were transformed to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, and a further modulation was conducted to preserve the volume of the GM. Finally, a 6-mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel was applied to smooth the modulated GM images.\nWe first used Pearson correlation to detect the relationship between age and total grey matter volume (GMV). Then, multiple linear regression analyses were used to determine GMV regions that were associated with age, controlling for the total GMV. To avoid edge effects around the borders between the GM and WM, we used explicit masking to restrict the search volume. The explicit masking was achieved using the SPM masking toolbox (http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/g.ridgway/masking/). This approach reduced the risk of false negatives caused by overly restrictive masking, as potentially interesting voxels may be excluded from the statistical analysis 21 . For the regression analysis, we used the family-wise error (FWE) of P o0.05 at the whole-brain level and \u2265 20 contiguous voxels as a threshold to correct for multiple comparisons.\nThe results indicated that age was significantly correlated with total GMV (r = \u2212 0.305, Po 0.001). Almost all areas of the cerebral cortex exhibited a significant age-related decline in GMV. In addition, the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes showed the most pronounced function, which to a large extent confirmed the previous findings (Fig. 5) . However, in accordance with one prior study 6 , we found that the occipital regions were less affected by age. "}, {"section_title": "Resting-state fMRI data", "text": "There is a widely reported finding indicating that clear segmentation between neural systems would consistently become lost over the course of normal human ageing; many intrinsic functional connectivity brain networks gradually become less internally coherent with age 7, [22] [23] [24] . In an attempt to replicate this finding, the current dataset was used to describe the changing trajectories of within-system connectivity along with age.\nThe resting-state fMRI data were preprocessed using Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI (DPARSF_V4.2, http://resting-fmri.sourceforge.net/), implemented on the MATLAB 2014a (Math Works, Natick, MA, USA) platform. The first 10 volumes of the functional images were discarded to account for signal equilibrium and the participants' adaptations to their immediate environment. The remaining 232 scans were corrected for slice timing and were then realigned to the middle volume to correct for head motion. Participants with head motion exceeding 2.0 mm in any dimension throughout the course of the scans were discarded from further analysis. Subsequently, the registered images were spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template (resampling voxel size = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4 mm 3 ). Next, nuisance signals representing motion parameters, global signals, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid signals were regressed out in order to control the potential impact of physiological artefacts. Here, we used the Friston 24-parameter model, which includes 6 motion parameters, 6 temporal derivatives, and their squares 25, 26 to regress out head motion effects. This approach was based on recent research that demonstrated that higher-order models are more effective at reducing the effects of head movements [27] [28] [29] . Then, after the spatial smoothing (full width at half maximum = 6 mm Gaussian kernel), bandpass filtering (0.009-0.08 Hz) was performed. These preprocessing steps followed the standard protocol published 28 . Whole-brain functional connectomes were constructed for each subject as a 264 \u00d7 264-node graph, labelled by functional systems 27 . Edge weights were calculated as the Fisher z-transformed correlation (Pearson's r) between each pair of nodes, and negatively weighted edges were removed from each correlation matrix to eliminate potential misinterpretation of the negative edge weights. For each specific system, the within-system connectivity was calculated as the mean node-to-node z-value of all nodes of that system to each other. The mean within-system connectivity means the average value of withinsystem connectivity over all of the systems.\nThe results indicated that the mean within-system connectivity would decrease with age. When we applied linear and nonlinear (second-degree polynomial) models to the within-system connectivity, we found that the age function was fit significantly both by the linear model (adjusted R 2 = 0.177, P o0.001) and by the quadratic model (adjusted R 2 = 0.195, P o0.001). There is a significant difference in two models (F = 10.9, Po 0.001). The quadratic regression model has a smaller Akaike Information Criterion (AIC = \u2212 1010.18) compared to linear model (AIC = \u2212 1001.24). If models that included more parameters than a linear parameter reduced AIC by at least 2.5 points, the more complex model was selected as a better fit to the data 30 . The figure shows a decrease (probably non linear) of functional connectivity with age (Fig. 6) ."}, {"section_title": "Usage Notes", "text": "We encourage other labs to use the dataset described in this publication under the requirement of citing the present data descriptor.
