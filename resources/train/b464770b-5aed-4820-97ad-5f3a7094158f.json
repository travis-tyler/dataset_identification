Teen mothers are more likely than other young women to drop out of school, remain unmarried and become single parents, and to live in poverty and rely on public assistance. To be sure, many of these factors reflect disadvantages that existed before these teens became mothers. Still, teen parenthood seems to perpetuate many of these burdens. It is also well documented that the children of these young mothers face adverse consequences as well. In fact, research suggests that the costs of teen motherhood are primarily borne by the children of these young mothers.\nUsing recently available nationally representative data on kindergarteners from the late 1990s, this paper explores the complex relationship between the age at which a woman has a child and how her child fares.

In general, children born to the youngest mothers (aged 17 and younger) were more likely to be from a racial or ethnic minority group than children born to older mothers. Only 12 percent of mothers aged 17 and younger were married, compared with 49 percent of those aged 20-21, 60 percent of those aged 22-24, and 84 percent of those aged 25-29. The likelihood of a child living with both biological parents at kindergarten entry increased with maternal age as well-only one-quarter of kindergarten children born to mothers aged 17 and younger lived with two parents, compared with 40 percent of children born to mothers aged 18-19, and 82 percent of children born to mothers aged 25-29. Perhaps because of differences in marital status, children born to teen mothers had families with lower socioeconomic status (including lower income and education) than other children.\nDifferences among children by age of mother at child's first birth. Kindergarten children studied showed differences in five areas: 1) cognition and knowledge, 2) language and communication skills, 3) approaches to learning, 4) emotional wellbeing and social skills, and 5) physical well-being and motor development (see chart on pages 4-5).\nCognition and knowledge. Before controlling for background characteristics, children born to mothers aged 17 and younger performed significantly worse on math, reading, and general knowledge tests, and teacher assessments than children born to mothers aged 20 and older. On the majority of these measures, children born to mothers aged 18-19 were not significantly better off than children born to mothers aged 17 and younger. After controlling for background characteristics, children of mothers aged 17 and younger had lower general knowledge scores compared with children of mothers aged 20-21. Children of the youngest mothers also had significantly lower test and assessment scores than children of mothers aged 22-29, suggesting that as maternal age at birth increases, so do children's cognition and knowledge levels by the time they reach kindergarten. Children born to mothers aged 18-19 did not perform better on any measures of cognition or knowledge than children born to mothers aged 17 and younger.\nDifferences in child, family, and mother's background characteristics by age of mother Table 1 shows child, family, household and maternal background characteristics of children in the sample by their mother's age at first birth.\nIn general, children born to the youngest mothers (aged 17 and younger) were more likely to be a racial or ethnic minority and to have been born low birthweight than children born to older mothers. Children born to mothers aged 17 and younger were least likely to be non-Hispanic white (38 percent compared with 45 percent of 18 to19-year-old mothers, 52 percent of 20 to 21-year-old mothers, 58 percent of 22 to 24-year-old mothers, and 73 percent of 25 to 29-year-old mothers respectively). Conversely, the children born to the youngest mothers were more likely to be Hispanic (27 percent) or non-Hispanic black (28 percent) than children born to older mothers (19 percent Hispanic and 13 percent black). These children were also more likely to be born low birthweight than children born to mothers aged 20 or older. Note that children born to mothers aged 18 to19 also were more likely to be a racial or ethnic minority and to have been born low birthweight than children of mothers aged 20 and older.\nThe likelihood that these mothers were married when they had their first child increased dramatically with maternal age at birth. Only 12 percent of mothers aged 17 or younger were married, compared with nearly one-third (32 percent) of mothers aged 18 to19, one-half (49 percent) aged 20 to 21, 60 percent aged 22 to 24, and 86 percent of mothers aged 25 to 29. The likelihood of a child living with both biological parents increased with maternal age as well. Only one-quarter of kindergarten children born to the mothers aged 17 and younger lived with two parents (26 percent) compared with 40 percent of children born to18-19-year-old mothers and 82 percent of children born to mothers aged 25 to 29. Moreover, children born to the youngest mothers were in households with dramatically lower SES measured at kindergarten entry. For example, only about 10 percent of children born to mothers aged 17 or younger and 13 percent of children born to mothers aged 18 to19 were in the two highest SES categories (\"quintiles\"), compared with 51 percent of children born to mothers aged 25 to 29.

Before controlling for background characteristics, children born to mothers aged 17 and younger scored lower than all other children except those born to mothers aged 18-19 on measures of approaches to learning (such as eagerness to learn, creativity, task persistence, concentration, and responsibility). When controlling for background characteristics, however, these differences in children's approaches to learning only remained when compared to children born to mothers aged 25-29.\nSocial skills and emotional well-being (negative and positive behavior). Before controlling for background characteristics, children of mothers aged 17 and younger were more likely than those born to mothers aged 20-21 to be impulsive or overactive and to suffer from anxiety, loneliness, low selfesteem, or sadness. In addition, they were more likely to argue, fight, and get angry than children of mothers aged 22 and older. Children of mothers aged 17 and younger were less likely to exercise self-control and demonstrate positive interpersonal skills than children of mothers aged 20 and older. Children of mothers aged 18-19 did not differ significantly from children of the youngest mothers. After controlling for maternal and child characteristics, children of mothers aged 17 and younger only demonstrated lower interpersonal skills than children born to mothers aged 25-29. Interestingly, children of young mothers scored higher on measures of social interaction than children of mothers aged 25-29.\nPhysical well-being and motor development. Before controlling for background characteristics, children born to mothers aged 17 and younger had fewer fine motor skills than children of mothers aged 20 and older and lower ratings of overall health than children of mothers aged 22-29. Children born to mothers aged 18-19 scored similarly to children of the youngest mothers.

Children born to mothers aged 18-19 did not perform much better on most measures than children born to mothers aged 17 and younger. The children born to mothers in their 20s clearly outperformed those whose mothers were still teenagers at time of birth, and the most consistent and pronounced differences were observed when comparing children born to mothers aged 17 and younger to those children born to mothers aged 22-29.

The U.S. has a significantly higher adolescent birth rate than such countries as England, Italy, Canada, and Japan. (Abma, Martinez, Mosher & Dawson, 2004) . Moreover, two out of three births to teen mothers are unintended (either mistimed or unwanted) (Brown & Eisenberg, 1995; Henshaw, 1998; Martin et al., 2003) , and the vast majority of teen births occur outside of marriage (89 percent of births to 15 to17-year olds and 76 percent of births to 18 to19-year olds) . Children born to unmarried mothers are more likely to grow up with only one parent and to experience multiple living arrangements than children born to married parents (Aquilino, 1996; Bumpass & Lu, 2000) .\nThe negative consequences associated with becoming a teen mother are well documented. Teen mothers are more likely than other young women to drop out of school, to remain unmarried and become single parents, and to live in poverty and rely on public assistance (Maynard, 1997; Moore et al., 1993) . Although many of these factors reflect disadvantages that existed before these teens became mothers (Ryan, Manlove, & Moore, 2004 , Upchurch, 1990 , teen parenthood serves to perpetuate and often exacerbate them. Moreover, the consequences of teen childbearing are not limited to the teens themselves-the children of these young mothers also are affected. Indeed, an extensive study on the effects of adolescent childbearing found that the costs (defined in this study as the costs of teen childbearing due to school dropout, health coverage, earning loss, incarceration, and a few other measures) of teen motherhood are borne primarily by the children of these young mothers (and then by the mothers, the government and taxpayers, and minimally by the fathers) (Maynard, 1997) .\nExpanding on prior research, this paper explores the complex relationship between the age at which a woman has a child and how her child fares using recently available data on a group of kindergarteners from the late 1990s.

Possible explanations for these disparities include the fact that teen mothers themselves perform worse on such tests; that they provide less enriching home activities for their children, such as family activities and reading; and that they tend to have more children than women who delay childbearing until they are older, giving them less time to devote to each child (Levine et al., 2001 ).\nThe National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy \u25a0 \u25a0 Child Trends"}, {"section_title": "9", "text": "Recent research has attempted to better explain differences in backgrounds of children born to teen mothers compared with older mothers.

Another scale measures \"externalizing\" problem behaviors and was taken from a survey in which teachers rate the frequency with which the child argues, fights, gets angry, acts impulsively, and disturbs ongoing activities. Teachers also rated the frequency with which their student exhibits \"internalizing\" problem behaviors including anxiety, loneliness, low self-esteem, and sadness. For the fourth negative behavior, parents rated their child on a \"sad and lonely scale\" which addressed whether their child had problems with being accepted and liked by others, sadness, loneliness, and low self-esteem.\nFour positive behaviors are also rated on a fourpoint scale, from 1 (never exhibits behavior) to 4 (very often exhibits behavior). The parent selfcontrol scale includes the frequency with which their child fights, argues, throws tantrums, gets angry, and controls temper, and was reversed to be a positive scale. Teachers also rated their students on self-control (respecting the property rights of others, controlling their temper, accepting peer ideas for group activities, and responding appropriately to peer pressure). Parents rated their children on a social interaction scale measuring the ease with which their child joins in play, ability to make and keep friends, and positively interacting with peers. The fourth positive behavior was measured by teachers who assessed their student's interpersonal skills including skills in forming and maintaining friendships, getting along with people who are different, comforting or helping other children, expressing feelings, ideas, and opinions in positive ways, and showing sensitivity to the feelings of others.\nPhysical health and well-being. The final set of dependent variables includes direct assessments of the child. The child's fine and gross motor skills were measured by a trained assessor. Fine motor skills include seven tasks: building a gate, drawing a person, and copying five simple figures.

Children born to mothers aged 17 and younger had lower test scores and teacher assessments than children born to mothers aged 20 or older. These findings indicate that children of young teen mothers are already behind cognitively when they begin kindergarten. They had lower reading, math, and general knowledge test scores and lower proficiencies on both reading and math assessments than children born to mothers aged 20 or older. It is interesting to note that on four of the seven measures, children born to mothers aged 18 to 19 were not significantly better off than children born to mothers aged 17 and younger. Still, children born to the youngest mothers had lower general knowledge test scores and marginally lower 8 reading test scores and beginning sounds assessments than children born to mothers aged 18 to19.\nAfter controlling for background characteristics, children of mothers aged 17 and younger continued to differ from children of mothers aged 20 and older in several respects. Compared to children born to mothers aged 20 to 21, children of younger mothers had lower general knowledge scores (an average of .8 points lower after controls compared with 2.7 points lower before controls) and marginally lower reading scores (an average of .6 points lower after controls). Children of mothers aged 18 to19 had outcomes similar to children of the youngest mothers. Differences still existed, however, in reading, math, and general knowledge test scores between children born to mothers aged 17 and younger and children born to mothers aged 22 to 24 and 25 to 29. Children of the youngest mothers also had significantly lower assessment scores than children of mothers aged 22 to 24 and 25 to 29. This suggests that, as maternal age at birth increases, so do children's cognition and knowledge levels by kindergarten entry, even after controlling for family SES, maternal marital status at birth, and current family structure. z Estimates with controls are based on predicted probabilities from multivariate models that control for all of the characteristics listed in Table 1.

Four of the five teacher reports found that language skills were significantly lower, though two were marginally significant, for children born to mothers aged 17 and younger, compared with children born to mothers aged 20 to 21. Compared to children born to mothers aged 20 to 21, children of the youngest mothers were less likely to read simple books independently and to demonstrate early writing ability. They also were marginally less likely to easily name all the letters of the alphabet and to demonstrate an understanding of some of the conventions of print.\nLarger differences were found between children born to mothers aged 17 and younger and those born to mothers aged 22 and older, with the greatest differences between the youngest and oldest mothers. In addition to discrepancies in the five teacher assessments, differences also were found on the overall assessment of conventions of print, with children of teen mothers aged 17 and younger scoring lower than children born to mothers aged 22 to 24 and 25 to 29. The one outcome that showed only marginally significant differences between 18 to19-year-old mothers and younger mothers-understanding conventions of printwas no longer significant after controlling for background characteristics. Table 4 presents differences in kindergarteners' approaches to learning by mother's age. Teachers were asked to rate on a one to four point scale (1=Never exhibits behavior, 4=Very often exhibits behavior), how often their student displayed such attributes as attentiveness, task persistence, eagerness to learn, learning independence, flexibility, and organization. Before controlling for background characteristics, children born to mothers aged 17 and younger scored lower than all other children except those born to mothers aged 18 to19. After controlling for child, family, and maternal background characteristics, however, this difference only remained when compared to children born to mothers aged 25 to 29. This suggests that family and maternal background characteristics can explain at least part of the difference in children's motivation to learn. Social Skills and Emotional Well-Being. Estimates of kindergarteners' emotional well-being and social skills are presented by age of mother at first birth in Table 5 . They are grouped as \"negative\" and \"positive\" behaviors and are reported both without controls and with controls. Without controls, when compared to children of mothers aged 20 to 21, children of mothers aged 17 and younger were more likely to be impulsive/overactive and exhibit internalizing problem behaviors and were less likely to exercise self-control and demonstrate positive interpersonal skills. In nearly all areas, children of mothers aged 25 or older had the lowest negative behaviors and the highest positive behaviors. Children of mothers aged 18 to 19 did not differ significantly from children of mothers aged 17 and younger on any behaviors."}, {"section_title": "Approaches to Learning.", "text": "After controlling for maternal and child characteristics, children of mothers aged 17 and younger did not score worse on any measures of negative behaviors than children born to older motherseven the oldest mothers. Regarding positive behaviors, however, two measures remained significantly different. Children of the youngest mothers had lower interpersonal skills (measured as a teacher's report of their skill in forming and maintaining friendships, getting along with people who are \"different,\" comforting or helping other children, expressing feelings, ideas, and opinions in positive ways, and showing sensitivity to the feelings of others) than children born to mothers aged 25 to 29. However, children of the youngest mothers scored higher than children of mothers aged 25 to 29 and marginally higher than children of mothers aged 22 to 24 on social interaction (measured as ease in joining play; ability to make friends; and positively interacting with peers). This latter finding contrasts with those without controls, which found no significant difference in social interaction skills between children of the youngest and oldest mothers. Health and Motor Development. Table 6 presents findings regarding physical health and motor development with and without controls. An analysis without controls found that children born to mothers aged 17 and younger had fewer fine motor skills than children of mothers aged 20 to 21. Children born to mothers aged 25 to 29 had the highest fine and composite motor skills and were rated the highest by their mothers on their overall health. Children born to mothers aged 18 to 19 scored similarly to children born to mothers aged 17 and younger. After controlling for maternal and child characteristics, children of the youngest mothers performed better on assessments of gross motor skills than children of mothers aged 20 to 21, marginally better than children of 18 to 19-year old mothers on assessments of fine and gross motor skills, and significantly better than 18 to 19-year old mothers on the composite measures of motor skills. (Tables 2, 3 and 4). Children's scores in these areas increased in tandem with maternal age. After controlling for maternal, child, family, and household characteristics, the extent of these differences declined. However, children born to mothers in their late twenties still had the highest cognitive test scores and assessments.\n\u25a0 Before controlling for maternal and child characteristics, as maternal age at birth increased, children demonstrated fewer negative and more positive behaviors. Specifically, children of teen mothers aged 17 and younger exhibited fewer social skills and lower levels of emotional wellbeing, on average, than children of mothers in their twenties (Table 5) . When controls were in place, however, differences in maternal and child characteristics explained all of the differences between children of teen mothers and children of mothers in their early twenties. Still, children born to mothers in their late twenties exhibited the highest levels of social skills and emotional well-being.\n\u25a0 Regarding physical well-being and motor development, differences between children born to teen mothers aged 17 and younger and mothers in their twenties were limited. Before controlling for maternal and child characteristics, children born to young teen mothers had fewer fine motor skills and a lower rating of overall health than children born to mothers aged 22 to 24 and 25 to 29. However, after adding background controls, there were no significant differences in health status of children by maternal age at birth. The two exceptions were a higher level of gross motor skills found among children of teen mothers aged 17 and younger than among children of mothers in their early twenties and a higher level of composite motors skills among the children of the youngest teens compared with children of teenagers aged 18 to 19."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The vast majority of children born to teenage mothers grow up in economically and educationally disadvantaged households. Nearly nine out of ten children born to mothers aged 17 and younger had mothers who were not married at the time of their birth, and most of these mothers had, at most, a high school diploma. Clearly, children of teen mothers start life with more disadvantages than children born to older women. Just how the mother's age at birth affects these children was explored both without controls and with controls and yielded some interesting findings.\nWithout controlling for background characteristics, compared to children born to women in their twenties, children of teen mothers aged 17 and younger began kindergarten with lower scores in five areas of school readiness: cognition and knowledge; language and communication skills; approaches to learning; emotional well-being and social skills; and physical well-being. On 19 of 26 measures, children born to teens aged 17 and younger fared moderately worse than children born to mothers aged 20 to 21. Moreover, when compared with children born to mothers aged 22 to 24 -and particularly those aged 25 or older-the differences were larger. This scenario changes somewhat when background characteristics are taken into account. Although the mother's age at birth remains important, its effect diminishes. In other words, the analyses show that part of the reason children of teen mothers begin kindergarten behind in several areas is because of their family's social and lower economic status and a higher likelihood of being in a single-parent household. Even so, older age at first birth is still associated with enhanced school\nThe National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy \u25a0 \u25a0 Child Trends 25 readiness after controlling for maternal and child characteristics. Indeed, children born to the oldest group of mothers (age 25 to 29) fared the best. Differences on assessments of cognition and knowledge and language development remained strong even after controlling for background characteristics, suggesting that children of the youngest teen mothers are starting school with deficits resulting from factors other than family structure and SES.\nChildren born to mothers aged 18 to 19 did not perform significantly better than children of mothers aged 17 and younger in any area. This suggests that merely delaying births into the later teen years does not result in notably improved early development for these children. In fact, three measures of motor skills (fine, gross, and composite) showed poorer outcomes among children of mothers aged 18-19 than those aged 17 and younger even with controls. One possible explanation for this difference may be household composition. A child born to a very young teen might be more likely than a child born to an older teen to live with their mother and grandparent so the teen mother can attend school. These children may benefit developmentally from having an older adult in the home. Another factor to consider is that mothers aged 18 to 19 are more likely to be married at the time of their child's birth (almost one-third were married compared with 12 percent of mothers aged 17 or younger). Although that fact would seem advantageous for children of older teens, marriages to teens are notoriously unstable, potentially exposing children to conflict and turbulence (Ryan et al., 2004) .\nPrevious research indicates that low educational and economic attainment among teen mothers often results from disadvantages that existed before they gave birth. However, analyses using sophisticated multivariate models have found that having a teen birth further increases the likelihood that a young woman will drop out of school, live in poverty, and end up relying upon public assistance (Maynard, 1997) . By delaying childbearing until her twenties or later, a young woman can develop a more stable and established portfolio -education, employment, marriage -than she would have as an adolescent mother. However, if a mother makes little progress economically or educationally between her mid-teens and early twenties, simply being older is unlikely to help her child make great strides in terms of kindergarten readiness."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "These findings suggest that teen pregnancy prevention programs need to delay childbearing not just by a few months or even into the late teens, but into the twenties, to enhance children's development. In addition, programs that include an emphasis on academic and employment success may be valuable. These programs not only can reduce the incidence of too-early childbearing, but they also may help improve school-readiness in the next generation by enhancing the economic, educational, and marital status of women before they become mothers (Philliber, Kaye, & Herrling, 2001; Philliber, Kaye, Herrling, & West, 2002) .\nIt would be valuable to repeat these analyses using later years of ECLS-K data to see whether the gaps related to age at first birth that were significant at kindergarten entry close over time or, instead, mark the start of increasing disparity as these children age. It also would be instructive to assess the factors associated with better child outcomes for children born to teenage mothers. This could help point to intervention strategies that should be stressed in support programs serving young mothers and their children."}]
