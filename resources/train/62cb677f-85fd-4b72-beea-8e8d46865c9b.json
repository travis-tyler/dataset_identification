"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Focus of This Report", "text": "This report provides a first look at selected findings from the first follow-up of the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09). HSLS:09 focuses on understanding students' trajectories from the beginning of high school into higher education and the workforce. The core research questions for the study explore secondary to postsecondary transition plans and the evolution of those plans; the paths into and out of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields of study and careers; and the educational and social experiences that are related to these shifts in plans or paths. The core research questions for HSLS:09 are longitudinal in nature, and release of first follow-up data marks the stage where researchers can first employ longitudinal data. Students were first surveyed in 2009 as 9th-graders, and then again 2.5 years later, in 2012, when most cohort members were spring term 11thgraders. This report focuses both on status as of the first follow-up (for example, mathematics and science enrollment) and on change (for example, achievement gains in mathematics) between the base year and the first follow-up. The purpose of this First Look report is to introduce new National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) HSLS:09 survey data through the presentation of selected descriptive information. Because this report is purely descriptive in nature, readers are cautioned not to draw causal inferences based on the presented bivariate results. It is important to note that many of the variables examined in this report may be related to one another, and complex interactions and relationships among the variables have not been explored. The variables examined here are also just a small number of those that can be examined in these data; they were selected to demonstrate the range of information available from the study. These findings are examples of estimates that can be obtained from the data and are not designed to emphasize any particular issue. The release of this report is intended to encourage more in-depth analysis of the data using more sophisticated statistical methods. With that in mind, this report highlights selected results of the mathematics assessment and student questionnaire, and examines them in terms of sex, race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and other student characteristics. Comparisons made in the text were tested for statistical significance to ensure that the differences were larger than might be expected as a result of sampling variation. All differences reported are significant at the p < .05 level. There were no adjustments for multiple comparisons. Estimates reported in the text that are summed across reported categories are based on the underlying unrounded estimates. Given the short format of this release report, information highlighted in the bullets does not report out all statistically significant findings from the tables. Further information about the dataset and the methodologies employed in collecting and processing the data can be found in the technical appendix to this report (appendix A) and, with greater detail, in the HSLS:09 Base-Year to First Follow-up Data File Documentation (DFD) (Ingels et al. 2013, NCES 2014, available from the NCES website located at http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/hsls09/."}, {"section_title": "Study Design", "text": "HSLS:09 is a longitudinal study of a nationally representative sample of approximately 20,000 ninthgraders in 944 schools. More specifically, the study is representative of fall term ninth-graders in schools with a 9th and an 11th grade in the fall of 2009. Students will be followed through their secondary and early postsecondary education and work years. The sampled schools encompass both public schools, including charter schools, and private schools providing instruction in the 50 states and in the District of Columbia. In 2009, fall-term ninth-graders were sampled within selected schools. All ninth-grade students in the sampled schools were classified as eligible for the study, including students with disabilities and English language learners who may not have been capable of completing the survey instruments. The base-year dataset also includes state-representative samples of public school students and schools in each of 10 states. More information about the sample design can be found in the technical notes (appendix A). The first follow-up of HSLS:09 occurred in the spring of 2012 when most sample members were in the 11th grade. A between-round postsecondary status update survey is taking place in the summer/fall of 2013, high school transcripts will be collected and coded in the fall of 2013/spring of 2014, and a full second follow-up is planned for 2016, when most sample members will be 3 years beyond high school graduation. Additional follow-ups are planned, to at least age 30. In both the base year and the first follow-up, students completed both a questionnaire and a two-stage adaptive mathematics assessment in algebraic reasoning and problem solving. The assessment is adaptive in that a student's performance on the first stage (the \"router\") determines the difficulty level of the form (low, moderate, or high)] of the second stage. The student survey and assessments were administered by computer. Students' tested achievement in algebraic reasoning can be reported in several ways in HSLS:09. A normreferenced approach is to divide students into five equal groups (called quintiles or fifths), from lowest to highest in mathematics achievement. Another test score that can be reported in HSLS:09 is the probability of a student's proficiency at any one of five base-year or seven first follow-up hierarchical levels of performance. 1 Although primarily student data are reported here, the HSLS:09 dataset includes important contextual data from other sources, including the school administrators, school counselors, science teachers, mathematics teachers, and parents of the students. Contextual data were gathered from each of these sources in the base year, and from school administrators, school counselors, and parents in the first follow-up. A proficiency probability score measures how well an examinee performs relative to set criteria representing mastery of knowledge and skills assessed. Finally, HSLS:09 assessment reporting supplies an item response theory (IRT)-estimated number-correct score, which puts results on a scale of 0-118. This report presents assessment data in all three of these ways."}, {"section_title": "Selected Findings", "text": "The percentage of students uncertain about their educational expectations decreased as they progressed through high school-from 22 percent among ninth-graders to 11 percent two and a half years later. Over this time interval, the percentage of ninth-graders with \"college graduation\" expectations increased from 17 percent to 28 percent, while the percentage with \"graduate/ professional degree\" expectations declined from 39 percent to 33 percent. (table 1) Ninety-three percent of ninth-graders in 2009 were in grade 11 in 2012. The percentage of ninthgraders in 2009 who were dropouts in the spring term of 2012 was 3 percent. Another 2 percent were in school but below grade 11 (indicating they had been retained) and a further 4 percent were in a grade higher than grade 11. (table 2) Of those enrolled in high school in spring 2012, 36 percent of students reported enrollment in algebra 2; 21 percent reported enrollment in pre-calculus or calculus. Eleven percent of students reported no math course enrollment. (table 3) Fifty-three percent of Asian students reported taking precalculus or calculus. This percentage was significantly higher than the next largest percentage, among White students (24 percent). Whites, in turn, had greater enrollment in precalculus or calculus (24 percent) than Blacks (12 percent) or Hispanics (16 percent). (table 3) Of those enrolled in high school in spring 2012, 35 percent of students were taking chemistry; 23 percent were enrolled in biology. Eighteen percent of students reported taking physics, and another 17 percent reported taking no science at all. (table 4) Of those students who reported they were college bound, students and their parents rated a variety of features as \"very important\" to their choice of a postsecondary institution: 74 percent of students and 79 percent of parents cited academic quality or reputation. Some 68 percent of students and 73 percent of parents cited cost of attendance as an important factor. A good record of placing graduates in jobs was cited by 73 percent of students and 76 percent of parents. (table 5) For the 2009 ninth-grade cohort in 2012, the highest educational attainment of either parent was master's or higher for 15 percent, bachelor's degree for 22 percent, an associate's degree for 17 percent, high school or equivalent for 40 percent, and less than high school for 7 percent. (table 6) The activity students most often reported in terms of preparing for life after high school was \"searched the Internet for college options or read college guides\" (80 percent), followed by \"talked with a high school counselor about options\" (63 percent). (table 7) Mathematics proficiency probabilities are clusters of items representing common content and a common level of difficulty. The proficiency probability with the largest change (23 percentage points) between 2009 and 2012 was level 3, mastery of algebraic equivalents. Forty-one (41) percent of the cohort in 2009 were proficient at level 3, versus 64 percent in 2012. (table 8) At proficiency probability levels 4 and 5, students in the highest fifth of the socioeconomic status (SES) distribution demonstrated larger gains from 2009 to 2012 than other students. For example, at level 4, the highest fifth gained 19 percentage points, the middle three fifths 10 percentage points, and the lowest fifth 5 percentage points. At level 5, the highest fifth gained 23 percentage points, the middle three fifths 8 percentage points, and the lowest fifth 3 percentage points. (table 8) Black ninth-graders had their largest gains at the three lowest levels of mathematics proficiency (level 1, algebraic expressions; level 2, multiplicative and proportional thinking; and level 3, algebraic equivalents). At level 1, between 2009 and 2012 Blacks gained 13 percentage points while Whites gained 4; at level 2, Blacks gained 21 percentage points and Whites 14. (table 8) \u2022 \u2022 Asian students had higher proficiency at levels 2 through 7 than students in other race/ethnicity groups. For example, 45 percent of Asians were at level 5 in 2012 versus 23 percent of Whites. (table 8) For the 10 states with state-representative public school samples in the first follow-up, level 1 proficiency (understanding of algebraic expressions) ranged from 89 to 94 percent in 2012; level 3 proficiency (algebraic equivalents) ranged from 58 percent to 68 percent; level 5 proficiency (linear functions) ranged from 13 to 21 percent; and level 7 proficiency (log and exponential functions/geometric sequences) ranged from 1 to 3 percent.

All of the studies monitor the transition of national samples of young people from the high school years to postsecondary statuses, including further education, participation in the workforce, and the assumption of other adult roles. The core research questions for HSLS:09 explore secondary to postsecondary transition plans and the evolution of those plans; the paths into and out of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; and the educational and social experiences that affect these shifts. The HSLS:09 base-year administration took place in the 2009-10 school year, with a randomly selected sample of fall-term ninth-graders in 944 public and private high schools with both a 9th and an 11th grade. Students took a mathematics assessment and survey online. In addition, students' parents, school administrators, and mathematics and science teachers as well as the school's lead counselor completed surveys on the phone or on the Web. The first follow-up of HSLS:09 took place in 2012 when most sample members were in the spring term of the 11th grade. Dropouts, newly homeschooled, and transfer students were followed, as well as those who remained in the base-year school. All sample members were eligible to complete both a questionnaire and a mathematics assessment. In addition to a student questionnaire and mathematics assessment, parents, administrators and counselors were also surveyed. A brief status update (to be completed either by the student cohort member or the parent) is underway (the summer/fall of 2013), to learn about the cohort's postsecondary plans and decisions. High school transcripts will be collected in the fall of 2013/early 2014, and a full second follow-up interview will take place in 2016, when most sample members will be 3 years beyond high school graduation."}, {"section_title": "A.2 Instrumentation", "text": "Instrument design for the HSLS:09 base year and first follow-up was guided by a conceptual framework that takes the student as the fundamental unit of analysis and attempts to identify the precursor factors, such as motivation, beliefs, and interests that may lead to academic goal-setting and decision-making. It traces the many variables-including perceived opportunities, barriers, and costs-that are associated with students' values and expectations and that factor into their most basic education-related choices. The _______________________________ study design also acknowledges the importance of social context and the interaction between students and their families, teachers, peers, and the wider community. Instrument design was also guided by the desire to develop computer-assisted research instruments that could be completed either in the school setting or outside of school. The student questionnaire was, for the first time in the history of the study series, electronically administered, as was the student assessment in algebraic reasoning. The contextual questionnaires-parent, teacher (base year only), school administrator, and counselor-were designed for Web self-administration or computer-assisted telephone administration by an interviewer. Computerization of the instruments was desired for several reasons, including its contribution to higher quality data and to the accurate assignment of second-stage forms in the math assessment (a two-stage adaptive test was employed). Student Questionnaire. The questionnaires elicited demographic information (for example, sex, race/ethnicity); language background; school experiences in the current and previous school year (including math and science experiences and course enrollment). It also inquired into constructs such as math self-efficacy and math identity, and high school, postsecondary, and career plans, among other topics. In the first follow-up, questions were tailored to students' pathways-for example, there were specific questions for those who had dropped out of school, and for those who had transferred. Parent Questionnaire. There was both a base-year and a first follow-up parent survey, the latter conducted with a subsample of parents. The parent questionnaire identified household members and their roles and characteristics; and obtained demographic data, information on immigration status and language use, socioeconomic status (education, occupation, income), the student's educational history (including grade retention and change of schools), family interactions, parental involvement in the cohort member's learning, and plans and preparations for postsecondary education. Mathematics Assessment in Algebraic Reasoning. The mathematics assessment was designed to provide a measure of student achievement in algebraic reasoning at two points in time (ninth and when the majority of students were in 11th grade). The test framework was designed to assess a cross-section of understandings representative of the major domains of algebra and the key processes of algebra. The test and item specifications describe six domains of algebraic content and four algebraic processes: Both in the base year and first follow-up, the assessment was built as a two-stage test, with a router (completed by all students) and a second-stage assignment of one of three forms of variable difficulty. For more information on the modeling of the direct assessment data, please see chapter 2 of the HSLS:09 Base-Year to First Follow-up Data File Documentation (DFD) (NCES 2014-361). Other HSLS:09 Instruments. Although not utilized in the analyses in this brief report, HSLS:09 also contains questionnaire data from several other sources including a school administrator survey (base year and first follow-up), a counselor survey (base year and first follow-up) and surveys of mathematics and science teachers (in the base year only). Further information about all HSLS:09 questionnaires may be found in chapter 2 of the HSLS:09 Base-Year to First Follow-up Data File Documentation (DFD) (NCES 2014-361)."}, {"section_title": "A.3 Sample Design", "text": "In the base-year survey of HSLS:09, students were sampled through a two-stage process. First, stratified random sampling and school recruitment resulted in the identification and contacting of 1,889 eligible schools. A total of 944 of these schools participated in the study, resulting in a 56 percent weighted (or 50 percent unweighted) school response rate. The target population at the school level was defined as regular public schools, including public charter schools, and private schools, in the 50 states and in the District of Columbia, providing instruction in both ninth and 11th grade. The target population of students was defined to include all ninth-grade students who attended the study-eligible schools in the fall 2009 term. In the second stage of sampling, students were randomly sampled from school enrollment rosters, with 25,206 eligible selections (or about 27 students per school). All students who met the target population definition were deemed eligible for the study. However, not all students were capable of completing a questionnaire or assessment. Students who, because of language barriers or severe disabilities (there were 548 such students in the base year) were judged by their schools to be unable to participate directly in the study were retained in the sample and contextual data were sought for them. However, they lack baseyear student survey and assessment data. Their ability to complete the study instruments was reassessed in the first follow-up. Of the 25,184 first follow-up eligible student cohort sample, 24,993 students were classified as first follow-up questionnaire-capable and 251 as questionnaire-incapable. In part, this first follow-up increase in questionnaire-capable sample members reflects the acquisition, by 2012, of English language skills for 2009 ninth-graders who had a language barrier to questionnaire completion. Of the 320 cases reclassified as questionnaire-capable in 2012, 184 (57.5 percent) had been defined in the base year as questionnaire-incapable owing to limited English proficiency (LEP). HSLS:09 school and student samples are nationally representative, and also state-representative for a subset of 10 states. For most purposes, the student is the unit of analysis. Data at the school, classroom, or home level may be attached to the student record as contextual data. Several contextual respondent populations were sampled. The school's head administrator comprises one such respondent group. The lead counselor (or most knowledgeable about the entering ninth-grade class) was identified (with the help of the school) and used as a source of school-level student contextual data. Mathematics and science teachers of HSLS:09 ninth-graders enrolled in these subjects were asked to complete a teacher questionnaire. The final source of contextual data was the parent or guardian. Parents were recruited in the base year, using contact information obtained from school-provided lists The parent was self-selected, using the criterion that the responding parent should be the one most knowledgeable about the ninthgrader's current experiences. In the first follow-up, all base-year sample members-including nonparticipants-were followed, and asked to complete the questionnaire and the mathematics assessment (both instruments were available to both in-school and out-of-school sample members). (Two exceptions to this are sample members who died, or were removed as base-year sampling errors discovered only in the first follow-up, e.g., not a ninth-grader in 2009.) First follow-up contextual data include information from administrators of schools that were included in the base year as well as schools to which students had transferred; from counselors of schools that were included in the base year (but not counselors in schools to which students had transferred); and from a random subsample of parents. Therefore, the first follow-up administrator and counselor data are solely a contextual source for students, because the first follow-up school sample is not nationally representative (although the base-year sample was)."}, {"section_title": "A.4 Participation and Bias: Data Collection Results", "text": "Tables A-1 and A-2 below summarize the results of instrument completion by each component, base year and first follow-up, for those components drawn upon for this report.  11,952 8,651 72.5 72.4 \u2020 Not applicable.

However, five schools are not included in the number of eligible schools; four had closed and one did not have any base-year students still enrolled. Participating base-year schools include schools that conducted in-school student data collection sessions. All 939 schools were contacted to complete school administrator and school counselor questionnaires regardless of whether they conducted in-school student sessions. 2 Transfer schools were identified from enrollment status updates provided by the school and responses provided in the student and parent questionnaire. Transfer schools were only contacted if at least one student from the transfer school participated in the first follow-up study. 3 A total of 22 students from the base year were ineligible for the first follow-up. 4 Weighted percentage uses the student base weight.

Four analytic weights were computed for the HSLS:09 first follow-up using a similar methodology as implemented in the base year. They include two student weights, one for analyses specific to the first follow-up, allowing for inclusion of base-year nonrespondents as well as base-year respondents in analyses (W2STUDENT) and one for longitudinal analyses associated with change between the base year and first follow-up (W2W1STU). Both first follow-up student weights are used in this report. In addition, two weights adjusting for patterns of parent nonresponse were developed, one weight for first follow-up-specific analyses (W2PARENT) and one for longitudinal analyses (W2W1PARENT)."}, {"section_title": "A.6 Nonresponse Bias Analysis", "text": "Nonresponse bias analyses were conducted to determine whether unit nonresponse from any of the data sources significantly increased the estimated bias for population estimates.

"}, {"section_title": "A.7 Imputation", "text": "Imputation of values for missing items is also an important feature of the HSLS:09 data set. Despite the best efforts of data collectors, some questionnaire items remain unanswered. Unit nonresponse at the parent level (and to a lesser degree missing assessment data as well) also affected the completeness of some key student variables such as (for example) family income, parental educational attainment, and occupation-all critical components of the socioeconomic status index. Imputation addresses the potential concern related to missing values. Advantages of using imputed values include the ability to use all study respondent records in an analysis (complete-case analysis) which affords more power for statistical tests. Additionally, if the imputation procedure is effective (i.e., the imputed value is equal to [or close to] the true value) then the analysis results are likely less biased than those produced with the incomplete data file. (On both the benefits and techniques of imputation see, for example, Little and Rubin 2002.) Although there was some item nonresponse on all HSLS:09 base year and first follow-up surveys, HSLS:09 variables in general did not suffer from high levels of item nonresponse. Nevertheless, a set of key analytic variables was identified for item imputation to facilitate complete-case analysis on data obtained from the participating student sample members. Both logical and stochastic imputation was used, and for the latter, both single and multiple imputation was implemented. Values were assigned in place of missing responses for 18 variables identified from the student and parent questionnaires through single-value imputation. Multiple imputation was used to address missing student ability estimates in mathematics (theta), the associated standard error of measurement (sem) for the theta, and socioeconomic status (SES) values. Regardless of the method, indicator variables (flags) were created to allow users to easily identify the imputed values. Missingness in other survey instruments was not addressed through imputation.

Some variables that had values with extremely low frequencies were recoded to ensure that the recoded values occurred with a reasonable frequency. Other variables were recoded from continuous to categorical values. Thus, rare events or characteristics have been masked for certain variables. Other variables were classified as high risk and were suppressed from the public-use file. The suppressing technique entailed removing the response from the public-use file (i.e., reset to a \"suppressed\" reserve code)."}, {"section_title": "A.9 Statistical Procedures in This Report", "text": "Comparisons that appear in the selected findings have been tested for statistical significance (set at a probability of .05) to ensure that the differences are larger than those that might be expected because of sampling variation. There were no adjustments for multiple comparisons. The conclusions stated in this report are supported by a two-tailed test of statistical significance, specifically, a t test. Whether the statistical test is considered significant is determined by calculating a t value for the difference between a pair of means or proportions and comparing this value to published tables of values, called critical values. The alpha level is an a priori statement of the probability that a difference exists in fact rather than by chance. The t statistic between estimates from various subgroups presented in the tables can be computed by using the following formula: where x 1 and x 2 are the estimates to be compared (e.g., the means of sample members in two groups), and SE 1 and SE 2 are their corresponding standard errors.

Calculating exact standard errors for survey estimates can be difficult. Several procedures are available for calculating precise estimates of sampling errors for complex samples. Procedures such as Taylor Series approximations, balanced repeated replicate (BRR), and Jackknife Repeated Replication, which can be found in advanced statistical programs such as SUDAAN, AM, or WESVAR, produce similar results.

In both the base year and the first follow-up, the assessment was administered by computer using a twostage design. In the first stage, each student took a common Stage 1 router test. On the basis of Stage 1 performance, each student was routed to a low, moderate, or high level of difficulty Stage 2 test. The scores used to describe students' performance on the mathematics assessment are based on Item Response Theory (IRT). The IRT model uses patterns of correct, incorrect, and omitted responses to obtain ability estimates that are comparable across the low-, moderate-, and high-difficulty test forms. Specifically, the IRT three-parameter logistic (3PL) model was used to calibrate the test items and estimate a student's ability. The 3PL model is a mathematical model for estimating the probability that a person will respond correctly to an item. This probability is given as a function of one parameter characterizing the proficiency of a given student and three parameters characterizing the properties of a given item-the item's difficulty, discriminating ability, and a guessing factor. The IRT model accounts for the three characteristics of each test question in estimating a student's ability. Scores on the HSLS:09 mathematics assessment are represented in three ways in this report: as membership in one of five quintiles based on the weighted distribution of all scores; as an estimatednumber correct score; and as a probability of proficiency in five discrete levels of algebraic content (for the base year) and seven discrete levels of proficiency (for the first follow-up)."}, {"section_title": "Mathematics IRT-Estimated Number Correct on Base-Year to First Follow-up Scale (X2X1TXMSCR)", "text": "The math IRT-estimated number correct is a criterion-referenced measure of achievement at the time of the base-year assessment. The criterion is the set of skills defined by both the HSLS:09 base-year and first follow-up framework and represented by the 118 items used to score the HSLS:09 first follow-up mathematics assessment. The estimated number correct for math is an estimate of the number of items students would have answered correctly had they responded to all 118 items in the item pool. The ability estimates (thetas) from the base year and item parameters derived from the IRT calibration were used to calculate each student's probability of a correct answer for each of the items in the pool. These probabilities are summed to produce the IRT-estimated number-correct scale score.
