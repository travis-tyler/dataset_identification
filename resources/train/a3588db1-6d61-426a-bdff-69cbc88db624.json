Sloan Foundation. The goals of the study were to discover the role of recruitment programs, retention strategies, and institutional culture in the production of doctorates in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) at selected Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), and to develop a model of research-based best practices. Results from the current study showed that institutional mission was ultimately linked to admission criteria and selectivity. Also, when looking at recruitment strategies, those considered most effective included: recruiting to retain, having involved parents, attracting talented Hispanic students, and providing financial aid. In addition, the most successful retention strategies included freshmen year programs, course re-design, academic support programs, and intrusive intervention strategies designed to prevent academic crises. This study also highlighted the importance of research opportunities for undergraduates, and the benefits of mentors as role models and networking resources. Findings from this research revealed that there are unique and culturally supportive environments and specific academic and affective strategies at these institutions that, when used in tandem, enhance Hispanic STEM students' abilities to pursue terminal degrees. The research-based best practices highlighted in this study can-and should-be replicated at other HSIs and at mainstream institutions with large Hispanic enrollment."}, {"section_title": "Definition of Terms", "text": "Following are the definitions of some specific terms used throughout this report: Baccalaureate Origin Institution-the baccalaureate or undergraduate institution from which the STEM doctoral recipient earned a bachelor's degree. Baccalaureate Origins Methodology-methodology that determines institutional productivity at the baccalaureate level. It was pioneered by Dr. Elizabeth Tidball, who used it to determine the productivity of women's institutions approximately 35 years ago. Carnegie Classification-The Carnegie Foundation classification of institutions of higher education institutions includes all degree-granting and accredited colleges and universities in the United States. This study uses the 2000 edition of classification categories. For a definition of the 2000 Edition Category definitions refer to: www.carnegiefoundation/classification/CIHE2000/defNotes/Definitions.htm. Hispanic-Hispanic is a term used to describe persons whose ethnic/cultural origins are from a Spanish-speaking country. This term encompasses the major sub-groups of Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cuban Americans, and Other Hispanics. The Survey of Earned Doctorates has included Cuban Americans and all other Hispanics except Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans in the single category, Other Hispanics. For purposes of this study, Cuban Americans are included as Other Hispanics. Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs)-These are accredited institutions of higher education, regardless of Carnegie classification, that have a Hispanic student enrollment of 25% or more, and fit the accepted U.S. Department of Education definition. Institutional Profiles-For the purposes of this study, the term 'institutional profile' is used to describe the results of the resulting data on recruitment and retention strategies, and on institutional culture, obtained via qualitative methods. Productivity Index-Used in the baccalaureate origins methodology, productivity index is a ranking of institutions according to their productivity ratios.  (Braziel 1983;Hill 1994;Leggon and Pearson 1996;Sharpe and Fuller 1995;Solorzano 1994Solorzano , 1995and Wolf-Wendel, 1998 "}, {"section_title": "X divided by Y times 100 = Productivity Ratio", "text": "To compute the productivity ratios for each category, a frequency count revealed that the interval during which the majority of these individuals obtained their baccalaureates was 1984 to 1993. The yearly average number of bachelor's degrees granted per institution during that interval was used as the denominator (Y). The numerator (X) was the total number of future Hispanic Ph.D.s produced by the particular institution between 1993 and 1997. Therefore, the number of future doctorates per institution (X) was divided by the yearly average number of bachelor's degrees granted by that institution during the specified time period (Y) times 100 (per 100 students). The computation revealed the productivity ratio of future doctorates per institution and resulted in the ranking of individual institutions for each category as described above.  Hispanics combined according to their productivity rankings. Ten of the twenty institutions in this group are Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs). Table 3, below, ranks the top ten most productive institutions for all Hispanics combined and according to gender. Sixty percent of the schools in Table 3 are also HSIs. The sample group of eleven institutions in the present study includes all those HSIs that ranked among the top twenty baccalaureate institutions for all Hispanics combined (Table 2), and among the top ten each when disaggregated by gender (Table 3). "}, {"section_title": "Approach", "text": "Each institution in the sample was contacted to request participation in the present study and to secure endorsement at the highest levels. All eleven institutions agreed to participate. Indeed, every institution extended itself to insure that the exchange was of the highest quality. Site visit arrangements were made for each institution and 140 individuals, including presidents, vice presidents, provosts, deans, faculty, administrators, staff, and students were interviewed by phone or in person during the study. Each interviewee signed an informed consent form, and each individual was guaranteed anonymity should his/her remarks be quoted in this document. All interviews were audio taped and transcribed verbatim. The interview data were coded and categorized according to three themes: recruitment programs, retention strategies, and institutional culture factors. The verbatim transcriptions of the interviews have provided ample material for detailed description for each institution. Data were triangulated when additional information was gleaned from review of written institutional documents and web site content. The process of triangulation among all three sources of primary data (interviews, written documents, and web-site content) yielded a deductive process that evolved into the institutional profiles. Each profile features the history and mission of the institution, demographic data about that institution, academic and financial information, data gleaned from interviews regarding recruitment and retention strategies, and a final section on institutional culture."}, {"section_title": "Summary of Research", "text": "The purpose of this study was two-fold. First, to document and describe the sample institutions' recruitment programs, retention strategies, and institutional cultural factors that may have contributed to the successful production of future Hispanic doctorates in STEM at the sampled institutions; and second, to assemble a set of Exemplary Practices based on the study's research findings.  Table 6 summarizes those programmatic strategies that are common to the sampled institutions. Common recruitment and retention strategies among these institutions include: reaching out to middle and high schools in their communities through summer bridge programs, campus visits, college/high school students interaction, and teacher training; executing articulation agreements with appropriate two-year institutions to facilitate student transfer; instituting freshman year programs such as cohort systems, freshman orientation, and freshman seminars; expanding opportunities for undergraduate research on and off campus; practicing intrusive intervention techniques such as an early warning system, tutoring, and supplemental instruction; recognizing the importance of good advising; and creating an infrastructure where smaller classes are possible and mentoring is facilitated.  Table 7 illustrates the cultural characteristics shared by the institutions in the study. These include: a system that recognizes the value of teaching and rewards good teaching appropriately and publicly; a cadre of faculty, staff, and administrators who believe in the importance of service learning, and in creating a nurturing and supportive (family like) environment for students; a supportive administration that encourages special program efforts through funding and insures that the institutional mission is carried out; and an organization that has adapted its programs and efforts to the context in which it functions."}, {"section_title": "Summary of Exemplary Practices", "text": "Selected programs and practices from the research-based institutional profiles of eleven Hispanic Serving Institutions are used as the building blocks to assemble a set of exemplary practices for student success at the baccalaureate level. A good portion of what is highlighted here pertains to the whole institution and not just to STEM areas. Indeed, findings from this study indicate that it is the overlapping and interlocking of institutionalized practices with specific discipline-based efforts that make these organizations successful. It is the overlapping of appropriate institutional practices with specific discipline-based efforts that help bring success. It is not possible for this study to quantitatively confirm that these practices are precisely the reason for the success of these institutions, however, consensus among experts indicates that they are important components in their efforts. Expectations resulting from this study are that replication of these findings, in whole or in part, may lead to an increase in the number of future doctorates in STEM fields at Hispanic-Serving Institutions, other Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs), and at majority institutions where there is a substantial Hispanic and other minority enrollment. There are numerous commonalities among the efforts of these institutions to provide students with the tools and an environment that promote baccalaureate completion and subsequent pursuit of postgraduate education in these disciplines. Some of the efforts are university-wide while others are disciplinespecific; some are operational at several of the schools while others are unique and innovative to one. The recruitment strategies and retention programs at these schools have been affected and influenced by the institutional mission and culture, and by the unique social and demographic context in which each school functions. The participating institutions exhibit a variety of characteristics regarding institutional control, selectivity, size, location, Carnegie classification, and financial resources. The eleven sites include public and private institutions ranging from a large urban public research university to several small private liberal arts universities. All the institutions in this study have one common characteristic-they are all focused in fulfilling their missions and providing the best educational goods and services possible within the realm of their capabilities."}, {"section_title": "Institutional Mission", "text": "The mission of each of the participating institutions is closely connected to institutional control (private or public) and both elements-mission and control-directly influence the admissions criteria and selectivity of each institution. There are five private and six public institutions in the study."}, {"section_title": "Recruitment", "text": "Because of cultural and demographic issues, Hispanics generally prefer to attend college near their home. Therefore, the most important factor to influence the recruitment process at the schools in this study is their location in heavily Hispanic populated areas, where Hispanics represent a ready and available pool of prospective students. However, although a large Hispanic enrollment is practically guaranteed for these HSIs, they do have to make special efforts to attract the highly talented and gifted Hispanic student, who, because of diversity initiatives at highly selective institutions, may have a myriad of school choices nationwide. The process of college recruitment is complex and expensive, requiring coordinated efforts in a variety of fronts in order to achieve the goal of enrolling the students with the best institutional fit and highest probability of graduation. Recruiting for retention protects the income generated from tuition, and minimizes the expenses connected with replacing those lost through attrition. The more targeted the recruitment effort is, the higher the chances that the student who arrives as a freshman will graduate. Other important facets of recruitment are parental involvement, providing adequate financial aid, and coordinating outreach activities to promote the institution and college attendance in general to the community. Since approximately 13% of the doctorate recipients in this study (14% nationally, Hill 1996) began their postsecondary education at a community college, it is very important for baccalaureate HSIs to facilitate transfer from two-year institutions."}, {"section_title": "Retention", "text": "Keeping students on track to baccalaureate degree completion is a major challenge facing many universities. Retention rates for Hispanics and other underrepresented minorities may be adversely affected by many factors, including poor pre-college academic preparation, low family income, first generation college status, commuter versus resident status, inability to develop a sense of belonging, poor social adjustment, heavy outside work demands, and a lack of heuristic knowledge. Therefore, it is necessary that institutions construct strong support infrastructures for retaining at-risk students. Numerous retention programs are in place at the HSIs in this study, included are a variety of freshman year programs, course redesign, academic support, intrusive intervention, supplemental instruction, advising and mentoring, and targeted strategies for creating 'community' among students. Research opportunities for STEM undergraduates are available at each school, albeit governed by the type, size, and wealth of the institution. Based on data from 140 interviews, of which 27% were faculty members, 29% were administrators, 40% were staff, and 4% were students, five major cultural elements emerged: the importance of a dedicated faculty, the merits of service learning, the benefits of mentoring, the sense of community as crucial to persistence, and that all institutional efforts need, and are validated by, support from the top."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Findings from this study confirm that there unique and culturally supportive environments, and specific academic and affective strategies that, when used in tandem, enhance STEM students' ability to pursue terminal degrees. In addition, results indicate that Hispanic students benefit from attending institutions that: \u2022 Understand that it is the relationship, coordination, and juxtaposition of institutional and discipline-based programs and strategies that enhance future production of Hispanic STEM doctorates; The Key: A culturally supportive environment along with specific academic and affective strategies at institutional and depart mental levels. \u2022 Understand the importance of creating an institutional environment where those of different cultures can function-indeed, succeed; \u2022 Understand the cultural values imbedded in the Hispanic culture, such as the importance of education and the importance of family, and address those appropriately. \u2022 Understand the importance of supporting and encouraging university personnel (faculty, administrators, staff) whose vision and energy converts them into catalysts for improved change; \u2022 Understand the importance of pursuing funding to create and operate special academic and heuristic programs, then to institutionalize those that work; and \u2022 Understand the importance, in light of the projected national demographics, of insuring that every individual who is part of our U.S. human capital is valued and no one's talent is underutilized or wasted."}]
