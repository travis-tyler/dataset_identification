It is characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive function deficit. Emerging evidences suggest that inflammation plays a central role in AD, and that the pathogenesis of the disease is not restricted to the neuronal compartment, but also involves immunological mechanisms. However, the exact function of inflammation in neurodegeneration is still matter of debate, and it probably has both beneficial and detrimental sides (1) .\nThe chronic inflammatory response occurring in AD patients appears to be triggered by damaged neurons, amyloid beta (A\u03b2) peptides, and neurofibrillary tangles (2) , which are neuropathogenic characteristics of the disease. Inflammation is present from pre-clinical to terminal stages of the disease, as reflected by activated microglia and reactive astrocytes that surround plaques. Microglia activation is a complex phenomenon, resulting in various phenotypes of the cells (secreting different types of cytokines), indicative of their interaction with the environment and allowing for either inflammatory or antiinflammatory responses. The reactive astrocytes that accumulate around the plaques participate in the clearance of A\u03b2 deposits and in cytokine secretion, thus enhancing the neuroinflammatory response initiated by microglia [for review, see Ref. (3)].\nDiagnosis of AD relies on multidisciplinary approaches, requiring in particular expensive imaging procedures and invasive collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for biomarkers analysis (4): A\u03b2 (in particular A\u03b242), tau, and phospho-tau (p-tau) proteins. Anyway and because of the non-specificity of the symptoms characterizing the disease, its diagnosis is often delayed at a time when the injuries have progressed. The diagnosis of certitude is based on the presence of two neuropathologic processes: neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid senile plaques composed of accumulated tau proteins and A\u03b2 peptides, respectively (5, 6) . Despite intensive investigation, there is no cure currently available but only therapies that aim at slowing down the progression of neuronal injuries (4) . These drugs are mostly effective at the earliest time course of the disease but are unfortunately administered later, at a time when the diagnosis is defined and injuries have progressed.\nBecause of the necessity of early diagnosis for optimal treatment and adequate handling of the patients, a reliable signature of specific biomarkers improving identification of pre-clinical AD would be of great interest. If CSF remains the most direct mean to study biochemical changes occurring in the brain, ideal biomarkers should be detectable and measurable in a fluid obtained through less invasive technique, such as the blood. Various groups have recently focused on the search of a plasma panel of AD biomarkers, thus opening promising perspectives in terms of diagnosis of the disease, including at prodromal stages (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . However, results were often controversial, because in particular of the heterogeneity of the population-based cohort used and/or the limitation in the sensitivity of the methods used. Thus no bloodbased panel has been validated so far as an aid for the diagnosis of AD (13, 14) .\nBecause of the inflammatory component of AD, one can hypothesize that pathological processes associated with this disorder would produce disease-specific molecular changes in the CSF and the blood, as a consequence of the inflammatory mechanisms. Thus, cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors could be expected to be modified, as these are the primary means of communication between cells. They could therefore represent valuable biomarkers for early screening and diagnosis of the disease. To test this hypothesis, we performed multiplex analysis of CSF and serum human samples and simultaneously evaluated the level of expression of 120 biomarkers (corresponding to cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and related signaling proteins) in these fluids. We discuss our results in this paper, in light of previously published results."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sample Collection and Handling", "text": "Blood was collected by venous puncture (BD vacutainer collection tube with clot activator, ref 368815), let it clot at room temperature (RT) for at least 30 min, centrifuged in the next 4 h at 1500 g at RT for 10 min.

Groups were homogeneous in terms of age, sex repartition, CRP, and CSF protein, and MMSE was decreased in AD group ( Table 1) .\nWe tested for normal distribution of the data concerning the 14 proteins measured and thereafter proceeded for t-student statistical test to evaluate significant difference between AD and control groups ( Table 2) . Results showed that in the CSF, among the 14 tested proteins, 3 biomarkers were significantly different between the two groups ( Table 2 , bolded and gray-highlighted results): sIL-6R, TIMP-1, and sTNFR-I. These three proteins were increased in the CSF of AD patients, compared to control subjects (Figures 4A-C) . Furthermore, three of the 14 biomarkers quantified were undetectable in the CSF of patients (FABP3, GROgamma, and TGF-beta1). On the other side, all of the 14 biomarkers tested were detectable in the serum but none of them were detected at a level significantly different between AD and control patients ( Table 2 ; Figures 4D-F) ."}, {"section_title": "ROC Curves, Regression Analysis and Decision Trees of the Biomarkers in the Serum and the CSF", "text": "We compared the area under the ROC curves (AUC) of all the analytes measured in the serum and the CSF of the 55 patients ( Table 3) . CSF tau and p-tau appeared to be the most efficient analytes to discriminate AD patients and control subjects (AUC values = 0.942 and 0.946, respectively). Among the analytes tested, seven presented an AUC \u2265 0.655 ( Table 3 , bolded and highlighted results). To combine these CSF biomarkers, we tested a logistic regression model which retained three biomarkers with the following equation: sIL6R \u00d7 0.0034615 + TIMP1 \u00d7 0.000024458 + TNFRI \u00d7 0.001016 \u2212 9.2101 (pg/mL). As illustrated in Figure 5A , this resulted in an important improvement of the AUC reaching 0.858 (corresponding at its best to a sensitivity of 74.2% and a specificity of 91.7%). The relevance of these biomarkers for AD was also supported by the fact that a significant \"Spearman\" rank correlation was observed between MMSE and CSF TIMP-1 (p = 0.03950) and between tau or p-tau and CSF sIL6R (p < 0.001). The low differences in expression of the biomarkers in the blood prevented their integration in the logistic regression model.\nWe also tested a simple classification tree model based on only two analytes (nodes) to minimize the risk of overfitting (Figures 5B,C) . For the CSF biomarkers, this resulted in a classification involving IGFBP6 and MIP-3 beta, reaching on their own a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 92% ( Figure 5B) . Interestingly, the logistic regression and the classification tree resulted in a different biomarker selection and the patients selected with the two models were also different. Additional studies on larger cohort will be needed to reconcile and eventually combine these results. Applying the same approach for serum biomarkers, it resulted in a classification involving IL-8 and TNFR-1, reaching a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 75% ( Figure 5C ).\nOf note, the control misclassified patients of the classification trees (Figures 5B,C) body dementia, vascular dementia, and subjective cognitive impairment). Based on the available clinical and biological data, it was not apparent why these patients were misclassified."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The 2011 revision of criteria for AD clinical diagnosis includes CSF biomarkers analysis: quantification of A\u03b242 peptides, tau, and p-tau proteins; however and despite its utility, its use in routine clinical practice and for the follow-up of patient is limited because in particular of the invasive character of lumbar puncture.\nThe link between neuro-inflammation and AD has opened attractive perspectives for the early diagnosis and handling of patients. Indeed, the possibility to identify a blood-based panel of biomarkers to detect AD patients could allow for a systematic and early diagnosis of them, at the time of the first signs indicative of cognitive impairment, therefore optimizing their care and treatment. In addition, the perspective of feasibility of an early biochemical diagnosis of patients through minimally invasive technique (such as venous puncture) is quite seducing.\nVarious studies described such a signature in the blood: among them, Ray et al. identified 18 blood biomarkers, some of which were subsequently confirmed by ADNI (8, 19) . The present work aimed at investigating the molecular mechanisms involved in inflammatory processes occurring in AD, intending to identify or confirm a profile of biomarkers characteristic of AD. To this end, the modification of various signaling proteins (chemokines and cytokines) in the CSF and the serum of AD patients were evaluated using multiplex strategies.\nThe protein-arrays approach used in the first place is very attractive because it offers the opportunity to evaluate, in a single test and through a reduced volume of biological sample, the simultaneous level of expression of numerous proteins. In the present study, the large screening of 120 signaling proteins in serum and CSF of AD patients seemed very promising but appeared unfortunately quite disappointing in the serum. Indeed, no putative biomarker could be identified through this approach. One cannot exclude the possibility that the proteinarrays approach might lack sensitivity and reproducibility to detect small and discrete differences in the level of expression of the proteins tested between the groups of our cohort. Anyway such observation remains quite intriguing because other studies, using similar approaches, described a blood-based panel of biomarkers discriminating control subjects and AD patients (8) . However, a strict comparison of these works remains challenging because of the heterogeneity and the different size of the cohorts used, and also because of the nature of the samples used (serum versus plasma). On the other hand, the technique provided interesting results in the CSF, as 13 putative biomarkers potentially discriminating control subjects and AD patients could be identified. Although such method is very useful as a first-step and large screening of candidates, it remains semi-quantitative and poorly sensitive. Thus, the putative biomarkers identified in the CSF had to be subsequently tested for confirmation through quantitative and sensitive methods.\nAmong the 13 predictors identified, 10 were analyzed through such quantitative approaches, according to the availability of the existent kits: GRO-alpha, IGFBP6, IL-3, IL-8, MCP-1, MIP3beta, sIL-6R, TGF-beta1, TIMP-1, and sTNF-RI. Because of their potential implication in inflammatory processes and AD, we also evaluated the abundance of four supplemental proteins present in our panels: GRO-gamma, RANTES, MIP-1beta, and FABP3, which were also described in the literature as putative AD biomarkers. These 14 proteins were quantified in both the CSF and the serum of an enlarged cohort of 55 subjects (AD patients and control individuals). Among these biomarkers, three presented significant increase in the CSF: sIL-6R, TIMP-1, and sTNFR-I, and could be combined in a logistic regression model. Interestingly, sIL-6R and sTNF-RI presented opposite way of variation in the serum, although not being significant in this fluid.\nMicroglia and astrocytes are the major sources of cytokines production in AD. Thus, A\u03b242 accumulation has been suggested to be a strong inducer of the neuro-inflammatory response in AD, exposure of microglia to A\u03b242 deposits increasing production of IL-6 and M-CSF (20) . M-CSF was also described to be increased in the plasma and the CNS of patients at the dementia stage of AD compared to control or MCI age-matched patients (20, 21) . decrease of M-CSF in the plasma of AD patients (8) . In our study, this cytokine presented a very low basal level and did not show any significant modification of level neither in the CSF or serum of our patients (protein-array results). In addition, IL-6 was barely detectable in the CSF and serum of our patients but as noticed above, its receptor (sIL-6R) was significantly increased in the CSF and showed a tendency to decrease in the serum of AD patients although not being significant. A CSF cytokine profile characterized by an increase of TNF-alpha associated with a decrease of TGF-beta could be a marker of the conversion of MCI to AD (22) . In addition, TNF-alpha was reported to be decreased in the plasma of AD patients versus control (8) . In our study anyway, we did not observe significant change in the CSF or the serum of TNF-alpha and TGF-beta level among the patients. Interestingly, the receptor of TNF-alpha (sTNFR-I) was significantly increased in the CSF of AD patients compared to control subjects and showed a tendency to decrease in the serum of AD patients. Of note, He et al. recently demonstrated that deletion of TNF-RI can inhibit A\u03b2 generation and prevents cognitive deficits in AD mice (23) , through the reduction of expression and activity of BACE1 mediated by NF-\u03baB signaling. Thus, chronic overexpression of neuronal TNF-alpha has been described to enhance local inflammatory responses in transgenic AD mice (24) . However, the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha is also reported to present neuroprotective effects in the brain (25) . In addition and very interestingly, analysis of AUC of ROC curves in our study shows that association of sTNF-RI was among the best biomarkers and that its combination with TIMP-1 and sILR-6 provides the most powerful combination for AD diagnosis. Such observation will have to be confirmed in another study through an enlarged cohort. On the other side, IL-3 is described in the literature to be reduced in the plasma of AD patients, which was also observed in our cohort (although not being significant). In addition, IL1beta is known to be secreted by activated microglia cells following A\u03b242 stimulation in vitro (26) . Thus this pro-inflammatory cytokine can be detected in microglial cells surrounding A\u03b2 deposits and in the CSF of AD patients (26) . Anyway, only very low level of this cytokine was detectable in the CSF and serum of our patients and no difference in its concentration could be noted among the patients. IGFBP6 is also described to be increased in the plasma of AD patients (8) but we did not detect significant changes of its level in our study. Interestingly, this molecule was retained in the classification tree model, which would need further validation in a larger cohort.\nChemio-attractive chemokines are known to participate in the inflammatory process of AD, through regulation of microglial cells migration at the site of inflammation (27) . In particular, CCL4 (MIP-1beta) has been described in reactive astrocytes surrounding A\u03b2 deposits (28) and CXCL8 (IL-8), CCL2 (MCP-1), and CCL3 (MIP-1alpha) are increased following A\u03b242 exposition of astrocytes (29, 30) . IL-8 has also previously been described to be increased in the plasma of AD patient (8) . In our study, we detected increase of IL-8 and MCP-1 in the CSF of AD patients and no significant modification of MIP-1alpha or beta, neither in the CSF nor the serum. On the other side, CCL5 (RANTES) was described to be downregulated in the plasma of AD patients (8) and we noted no significant variation of this chemokine between the two groups of our study. GRO-alpha has also been reported to be a CSF biomarker of interest for AD diagnosis (31) but its level remained unchanged between our two groups. GRO-gamma (CXCL3) was undetectable in the CSF of our patients and remained unchanged in the serum among the patients.\nIn addition, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are believed to be involved in the pathologic processes of AD. TIMP-1 is the tissue inhibitor of MMP-9 and has been described to be increased in the CSF of AD and MCI patients (32) . In our study, TIMP-1 was also significantly increased in the CSF of AD patients. Its level appeared stable in the serum of all populations of our cohort.\nFinally, obesity, defined as a disorder in which excess fat accumulates in the body, also induces chronic inflammatory processes. Indeed, obesity has been associated with higher risk to develop AD (33) . FABP3 is a member of the fatty acid binding proteins and has recently been described to be down-regulated in the brain of AD patients (34) . However, FABP3 was not detectable in the CSF and presented no significant variation in the serum of our patients.\nIdentification of a molecular signature for AD diagnosis is very promising in terms of handling of patients and early diagnosis of AD, but remains quite challenging. Indeed, numerous studies have described panels of biomarkers of potential interest but at the time of their confirmation, results appeared to be largely biomarkers (B) defined as AD samples those with IGFBP6 >300,000 pg/mL and MIP-3beta >160 pg/mL. Using serum biomarkers (C), the criteria selected for AD diagnosis was: IL8 <23 pg/mL and TNFR-I <5260 pg/mL."}, {"section_title": "45", "text": "controversial [for review, see Ref. (3)].

On the other hand, using classification trees, we could obtain notable results in both CSF and serum, involving, respectively, IGFBP6 and MIP-3 beta or IL-8, and TNFR-I.
