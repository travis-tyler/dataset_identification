[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Plasma neurofilament light (NFL) is a promising biomarker for Alzheimer disease (AD), which increases in the early stage of AD and is associated with the progression of AD. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of plasma NFL in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (ADNI-1) cohort to identify novel variants associated with AD. Methods: This study included 179 cognitively healthy controls (HC), 176 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 172 patients with AD. All subjects were restricted to non-Hispanic Caucasian derived from the ADNI cohort and met all quality control (QC) criteria. Association of plasma NFL with the genetic variants was assessed using PLINK with an additive genetic model, i.e.dose-dependent effect of the minor alleles. The influence of a genetic variant associated with plasma NFL (rs7943454) on brain structure was further assessed using PLINK with a linear regression model.

Well-established cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers including A\u03b2 42 , total-tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau) have been used for the diagnosis of AD and monitoring its progression [2] , but the their application is hampered by a high degree of invasiveness, complex operations and high costs. Biomarkers in peripheral blood are more appropriate screening tools for AD among old individuals to monitor AD progression. Interestingly, recent studies using ultrasensitive assay showed that plasma neurofilament light (NFL), the main component of neurofilaments (cytoskeletal protein of neurons), increased in patients with AD dementia and was associated with other established CSF and neuroimaging biomarkers of AD [3, 4] . Plasma NFL is a noninvasive biomarker for neuronal injury in AD compared with CSF biomarkers. Thus, it has the potential for monitoring AD progression [3] .\nAD is a clinically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease with a strong genetic component. Genetic risk factors of AD impact the CSF or neuroimaging biomarkers through which they might modulate the process of AD [5] . Thus, biomarkers for AD may be used as endophenotypes to explore the genetic factors that impact their metabolism [6] [7] [8] . Based on the association between plasma NFL and AD, we performed a genomewide association study (GWAS) using plasma NFL as an endophenotype of AD to explore genetic factors involved in plasma NFL metabolism. We hypothesized that these genetic factors may influence pathological change in AD."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "In this study, 172 AD patients, 176 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 179 healthy controls (HC) whose data met all quality control (QC) criteria were included from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (ADNI-1) cohort.

The use of quantitative traits in GWAS has been shown to increase statistical power over case-control designs [8] . We identified two SNPs (rs7943454, rs640476) associated with plasma NFL at suggestive levels. The minor allele (T) of rs7943454 within LUZP2 increased the onset risk of AD and was associated with atrophy of right middle temporal gyrus in the entire cohort of the oneyear longitudinal study. The use of plasma NFL as an endophenotype of AD for GWAS enabled us to identify a novel AD candidate gene in addition to examining the influence of well-known AD genes on AD biomarkers. We also found the minor allele (T) of rs7943454 in LUZP2 was associated with higher plasma NFL levels in a dose-dependent fashion. In contrast, the minor allele (G) of rs640476 near GABRB2 was associated with lower plasma NFL at suggestive levels in a dose-dependent effect in all diagnostic groups except the MCI group. Plasma NFL showed significant increase in AD patients than in MCI and healthy controls (P < 0.001). Similar with CSF NFL, plasma is not disease-specific and even more marked increases are found in several other neurodegenerative disorders. Increasing evidence indicates that plasma NFL is a potential biomarker for the progression of AD but not for the diagnosis [4, [14] [15] [16] . Plasma NFL is noninvasive and has diagnostic accuracy for AD in the same range as established CSF biomarkers [3] . Plasma NFL may be widely used as a biomarker in Fig. 2 Mean plasma NFL levels of different diagnostic groups and genotypes. Mean and standard errors of plasma NFL levels are shown for groups defined by baseline diagnosis and genotypes. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant after examination with a multiple linear regression model using age, gender and the diagnosis as covariates. a The minor alleleofrs7943454 (T) showed association with higher plasma NFL levels in a dose-dependent effect in all diagnostic groups. b The minor allele of rs640476 (G) showed association with lower plasma NFL levels in a dosedependent effect in all diagnostic groups except the MCI group clinical studies and drug development of AD, although there is still a long way to go. The elevated NFL levels in plasma also indicate that the degeneration of largecaliber axons plays an important role in the progression of AD [14] .\nThe variation rs7943454 is located on chromosome 11p14.3 within LUZP2 region. LUZP2 is a leucine zipper protein coding gene that has been reported to be deleted in some patients with Wilms tumor-Aniridia-Genitourinary anomalies-mental Retardation (WAGR) syndrome [17] . It has also been reported that LUZP2 was associated with prostate cancer and hypereosinophilic syndrome [18, 19] . The function of LUZP2 is still unclear and inhibition of its expression did not show any obvious abnormal phenotypes in mice [20] . Rs7943454 in LUZP2 has been reported as a risk locus of AD in IGAP, which has been validated in our analysis. The minor allele (T) of rs7943454 increased plasma NFL levels in a dose-dependent fashion and was associated with atrophy of right middle temporal gyrus in the hybrid population. Neuroimaging changes occur years before cognitive decline and middle temporal gyrusis identified as a critical region of memory that changes in the early stage of AD, followed by progressive neocortical damage. Atrophy of middle temporal gyrus is now considered to be a valid diagnostic marker in the early stage of AD [21] . Our study showed that the minor allele (T) of rs7943454 increased the atrophy rate of right middle temporal gyrus in the one-year follow-up study and the C-allele remarkably prevented its atrophy. This result further proved that rs7943454 was associated with the onset risk of AD and LUZP2 may be a new susceptibility gene of AD. However, we didn't find any relation between rs7943454 and right middle temporal gyrus in subgroups due to the limited sample size.\nThe variation rs640476 is located on chromosome 5 q34, the intergenic region between GABRB2 (gammaaminobutyric acid type A receptor beta2 subunit) and LOC285629 (also known as LINC02159, long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 2159). GABRB2 is the gene coding \u03b22 subunit of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid receptor type A (GABAA receptor), which is the major mediator of fast inhibitory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. Mutations in GABRB2 genes have been reported to be associated with intellectual disability and epilepsy [22, 23] . A missense mutation in GABRB2 was also reported to be associated with early myoclonic encephalopathy [24] . Mutations in GABRB2 may reduce the expression of GABAA receptor and change the channel function, which could perturb GABA ergic inhibition in the brain. Disruption of excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) balance may be an important mechanism contributing to AD cognitive decline. Interestingly, despite vast neuronal loss in AD patients, GABA ergic neurons and receptors are relatively spared [25] . We have conducted a linkage disequilibrium analysis in order to annotate the identified functional variants. We found five loci which has strong linkage disequilibrium with rs7943454 All these loci are also located in an intron region. We detected only one locus which has strong linkage disequilibrium with rs640476 (rs587875: r 2 = 0.98, D' = 1) and was also in an intergenic region.\nReplication studies with independent, larger samples will be important to confirm these findings. In this study, we used a stringent MAF threshold (MAF > 0.20) and stringent Bonferroni corrections. These restrictions can improve statistical power to avoid false positive result but may miss less common SNPs. The modest number of subjects restricts stratified analyses for the three diagnostic groups. Besides, a two-year follow-up may be too short to observe the influence of rs7943454 on brain structure changes."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In summary, we identified that two SNPs (rs7943454 in LUZP2 and rs640476 near GABRB2) were associated with plasma NFL at suggestive levels.
