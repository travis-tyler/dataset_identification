[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The winter and early spring weather in the New York Metropolitan Region is highly influenced by extratropical storm systems, and the storm surge associated with these systems is one of the main factors contributing to inundation of coastal areas. The present study demonstrates the predictive capability of an established statistical relationship between the \"storm maximum\" storm surge associated with an extratropical storm system and the storm composite significant wave height. Data from publicly available retrospective forecasts of sea level pressure and of wave heights, along with a regression equation for storm surge, were used to predict the \"storm maximum\" storm surge for 41 storms in the New York Metropolitan region during the period from NOAA\"s deterministic surge prediction and the observed surge at the 95% significance level and to be statistically indistinguishable from the difference between NOAA\"s operational surge forecast and the observed values of surge. These statistical estimates can be used as part of a system for predicting coastal flooding.\n3"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The New York Metropolitan Region is particularly vulnerable to the damage caused by the frequent extratropical low-pressure systems that occur during fall, winter and spring months. In association with the storms, severe conditions such as high winds, heavy rain, blizzards, very low temperatures and storm surge can prevail for several hours and up to a few days. The Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR4 2007) estimates that over the next century global sea level is likely to rise from between 18 to 59 cm, and this will extend the zone of impact from storms, storm surge, and storm waves farther inland. The potential for property damage and loss of life due to storm surge and flooding and necessitate accurate predictions of high water levels associated with storm conditions. Storm surge is commonly defined as the difference between the predicted astronomical tide and the observed water level associated with a particular phenomenon such as a storm. The predicted astronomical tide is the daily change in water level produced by the gravitational interactions of the earth, moon and sun and it is calculated by performing complex harmonic analysis of observations of water level at a given location. The characteristics of storm surge depend on, for example, tides, wind stress, atmospheric pressure, wave height, transport of water by waves and swell and effects of coastline configuration and bathymetry. Predictions of storm surge have been made using both dynamical and statistical methods. The earliest efforts at dynamical modeling were hampered by the lack of meteorological observations over the water and by the need to make oversimplifications to make the dynamics computationally tractable. This led researchers to develop empirical and statistical relationships between wind and pressure fields and water level changes based on relationships derived from simplified theory and equations of motion. An early method for forecasting the maximum storm surge based on connections between significant wave height and storm surge in the Boston region was presented by Tancredo (1958) . He used the Bretschneider-revised Svedrup-Munk method (Bretschneider, 1951) to compute significant wave heights from equations that relate wave heights to wind data and a regression equation to forecast storm surge from these computed significant wave heights. Another statistical method, this one based on linearized two-dimensional hydrodynamic equations, was developed by Harris (1962) and consisted of a regression equation that related the surge at a specific location and time to a \"meteorological factor\" selected according to the type of observation and the location of the observation station. Harris and Angelo (1963) tested the model using past data from Buffalo, New York and Toledo, Ohio. The authors concluded that the prediction obtained with this approach was equivalent or superior to a prediction based on the direct integration of the hydrodynamic equations and using the same data.\nA method using statistical relationships derived purely from observations was developed by Pore et al. (1974) , who related meteorological data to the observed storm surge. The technique is based on data for 13 winter seasons, from 1956 to 1969, and data from eight east coast water gauge stations for the storms that caused surge equal to or greater than two feet. Atmospheric surface pressure values, with appropriate time lags, were considered as possible predictors of the storm surge. The surge equation for New York involved predictors at eight grid points with time lags ranging from 0 to 6 hours. A test of this method using data from a series of past storms revealed that the time of the peak surge values was determined correctly, but the forecasts were generally too low.\nThis low bias was adjusted by multiplying the forecasted surge by the reciprocal of the correlation coefficient between the storm surge and the predictors. This statistical method to forecast storm surge became operational shortly after its development and it continues to be used today to guide the official National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) surge forecasts.\nMore recently, DeGaetano (2008) investigated another statistical approach and used a published series of strong East Coast winter storms, storms during the OctoberApril storm season, to correlate the occurrence of storms to extreme surge events at three water gauge stations in the New York Metropolitan region. Extreme surge events were defined based on hourly values that exceeded either the 99 th or the 99.9 th percentiles from October through April over the period of record. Analysis revealed that less than 7% (24%) of the extreme surge events defined using the 99 th (99.9 th ) percentile threshold occurred in association with these storms. The author concludes that even though the occurrence of strong storms and extreme surge is correlated, the predictive capability of this correlation is limited. He suggested a possible explanation for this limitation associated with the fact that the storms used in the analysis represent coast-wide conditions, whereas the extreme surge events at the water gauge stations used to detect surge were caused only by those storms that directly affect the Metropolitan Region.\nPresent dynamical models include the NOAA ET-SURGE model developed by Kim et al. (1996) , the Advance Circulation Model for Coastal Ocean Hydrodynamics (ADCIRC) model of Luettich et al. (1992) , and the Estuarine Coastal and Ocean Model (ECOM) of Blumberg and Mellor (1987) . ET-SURGE is NOAA\"s deterministic, realtime, forecast model for extratropical storm surge information (Ji et al., 2010) . It is the extratropical version of the Sea, Lake and Overland Surge from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model (Jelesnianski et al., 1992 ). The ADCIRC model solves a set of steady state, barotropic equations, and was developed to simulate wind driven and tidal circulation in coastal waters. The specifics of the ADCIRC grid enable the simulation of flooding of coastal areas above sea level during storm events (Colle et al., 2008 (Colle et al., 2008) , indicating the necessity of a better understanding of the complexities determining storm surge.\nIn addition to the surge forecasts at lead-time of a few days, the availability of accurate weather forecasts out to 5-10 days or longer raises the issue of longer term surge forecasts as well. Owing to larger computers and more sophisticated models, Numerical\nWeather Prediction (NWP) skill has improved markedly over time (Simmons and Hollingsworth, 2002) making it possible to drive storm surge models on regional scales. In addition to characterizations of regional storm strength and frequency in a future climate, characterizing storm surge and inundations would of interests to regional planners, as it would guide mitigation measures, such as the construction of storm walls.\nA new statistical method for storm surge developed using observations is presented here. It is based on a regression relation between storm surge and significant wave heights established in a study by Salmun et al. (2009) , who used a focused regional approach to investigate properties of coastal storm systems (winds, precipitation and waves), and the resulting regional impacts (erosion, storm surge, flooding, wind damage).\nThe method presented here chooses a set of storms for evaluation purposes from observed sea level pressure, and uses time series of forecasted significant wave heights along with the regression equation to compute a forecasted storm surge. The statistical forecast is then evaluated against dynamically predicted storm surge and is compared to the storm surge calculated from water level observations at The Battery. The present study seeks to establish the predictive value of the regression equation of Salmun et al. (2009) . Following this introduction, the statistical method as well as the forecast products used is presented. A discussion of the results and of the comparisons of these results to the observed storm surge values and to the storm surge forecast by NOAA are presented in Section 3, followed by the summary and conclusions."}, {"section_title": "Data and Methods", "text": "The method used in the present paper follows the work of Salmun et al. The fields used as part of the regression analysis reported in S09 were the storm composites of minimum pressure, pressure tendency, wind speed, wind direction, wind gustiness, significant wave height, wave direction, dominant wave period and storm duration. The regression analysis revealed that SSMAX estimated using the significant wave height as the sole predictor is statistically equivalent to SSMAX estimated using any other combination of predictors. In addition, S09 reported that the regression analysis performed using observations taken at other NDBC stations in the region showed that the best estimate of observed SSMAX at The Battery was obtained when using predictors based on data from NDBC station 44025. A map of the study area, indicating the locations of NDBC station 44025 and The Battery, is provided in Figure 2 .\nTo establish the predictive value of the regression equation obtained by S09, a series of retrospective forecasts of SSMAX were performed using forecasted sea level pressure fields, forecasts of significant wave heights, and the regression equation to compute SSMAX. The NOAA ET-SURGE standard forecast of surge was used for comparison, and both the NOAA and the statistical forecasts were compared against storm surge data computed from observations of water level at The Battery. This procedure is depicted in the bottom half of the flow diagram in Figure 1 .\nThe present study, intended to evaluate the part of our methodology to estimate the storm surge, puts aside the evaluation of the accuracy of the underlying storm forecasts themselves. We therefore choose a list of test cases from the list of storm events that were accurately forecast. The values of \"storm maximum\" storm surge (SSMAX) computed as described above from the statistical forecasts, the NOAA ET-SURGE model output, the NOAA operational forecasts and the observations at The Battery are compared and the results are presented in the next section."}, {"section_title": "Discussion of Results", "text": "Each of the 41 ECCS test events was assigned a storm ID number. The dates, beginning and end, and duration in hours corresponding to each ID number can be found in Table 1 -Storm List. The focus of the discussion presented here is the analysis of 12-hour lead time forecasts and results for 24-and 48-hour lead time forecasts will be briefly summarized for comparison. Figure 3 , panels a and b, show the SSMAX for each predicted ECCS event. The black bars in Figure 3a represent the SSMAX statistical estimates using our method (STAT FCST) and the dark gray bars in both panels represent the observed SSMAX at The Battery (OBS). The error bars in Figure 3a , represented by the white portion of the dark gray bars, correspond to the RMS error of the regression, that is, the RMS error associated with the regression estimate of SSMAX when the observed significant wave height is the predictor. The white bars in Figure 3b represent the SSMAX computed from ET-SURGE model output, and the light gray bars represent SSMAX computed from the anomaly-corrected NOAA operational surge forecast.\nThe error in the SSMAX estimate using the regression equation based on the predicted significant wave heights can be thought of as having a contribution due to the significant wave height forecast error and a contribution due to the regression equation estimate itself. Assessment of the SSMAX prediction error relative to the error in an SSMAX estimate using observed significant wave heights leaves us with a measure of the error due to the predictive nature of the significant wave heights. An SSMAX forecast inside the error bars is one for which the predicted significant wave heights are statistically indistinguishable from the observed significant wave heights as an SSMAX predictor. A qualitative analysis of those ECCS events for which the error in the statistical SSMAX prediction was large resulted in a distinction between those events for which the SSMAX error was due mainly to errors in forecasted significant wave heights and those events for which the SSMAX error was mainly due to the failure of the regression "}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusions", "text": "A new statistical method for predicting \"storm-maximum\" storm surge "}]
