[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease in which the formation of extracellular aggregates of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) peptide, intraneuronal tau neurofibrillary tangles and microglial activation are major pathological hallmarks. One of the key molecules involved in microglial activation is galectin-3 (gal3), and we demonstrate here for the first time a key role of gal3 in AD pathology. Gal3 was highly upregulated in the brains of AD patients and 5xFAD (familial Alzheimer's disease) mice, and found specifically expressed in microglia associated with A\u03b2 plaques. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the LGALS3 gene, which encodes gal3, were associated to an increased risk of AD. Gal3 deletion in 5xFAD mice attenuated microglia-associated immune responses, particularly those associated with TLR and TREM2/DAP12 signaling. In vitro data demonstrated the requirement of gal3 to fully activate microglia in response to fibrillar A\u03b2. Gal3 deletion decreased the A\u03b2 burden in 5xFAD mice and improved cognitive behavior. Electron microscopy of gal3 in AD mice demonstrated i) a preferential expression of gal3 by plaque-associated microglia, ii) its presence in the extracellular space and iii) its association to A\u03b2 plaques. Low concentrations (1 nM) of pure gal3 promoted cross-seeding fibrilization of pure A\u03b2. Importantly, a single intrahippocampal injection of gal3 along with A\u03b2 monomers in WT mice was sufficient to induce the formation of insoluble A\u03b2 aggregates that were absent when gal3 was lacking. High-resolution microscopy (STORM) demonstrated close co-localization of gal3 and TREM2 in microglial processes, and a direct interaction was shown by a fluorescence anisotropy assay involving the gal3 CRD domain. Furthermore, gal3 stimulated the TREM2-DAP12 signaling pathway. In conclusion, we provide evidence that gal3 is a central regulator of microglial immune response in AD. It drives proinflammatory activation and A\u03b2 aggregation, as well as acting as an endogenous ligand to TREM2, a key receptor driving microglial response under disease conditions. Gal3 inhibition may, hence, be a potential pharmacological approach to counteract AD.\nTomas Deierborg (tomas.deierborg@med.lu.se), Jose Luis Venero (jlvenero@us.es) and Antonio Boza-Serrano (antonio.boza_serrano@med.lu.se).\nAlzheimer's disease, Galectin-3, TREM2, Microglial, Amyloid Aggregation. classical hallmarks of AD include the formation of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) plaque deposits and of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) containing abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau. Over the course of the disease, the deposition of A\u03b2 and the formation of the NFTs appear to be correlated with the on-going hippocampal neurodegeneration [7] . Hippocampal neurodegeneration has a negative effect on the cognitive ability of patients, especially short-term memory, which is impaired. The mechanisms triggering the deposition of the A\u03b2 or the formation of NFT are currently unclear. However, several mechanisms and factors have been suggested to be involved in the initiation and the progression of the disease, including activation of the innate immune system, environmental factors and lifestyle [51] . The innate immune system has been widely studied and has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases [27] . Over the last years, several studies have suggested inflammation plays a major role in the initiation and progression of AD [21, 24, 28, 71, 75] .\nThe inflammatory process in the central nervous system (CNS) is generally referred to as neuroinflammation. Glial cells have a leading role in propagating neuroinflammation. Within glial cells, microglia are considered the main source of pro-inflammatory molecules within the brain [25, 35, 72] . It is believed that sustained proinflammatory molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, nitrogen reactive species (NRS) or reactive oxygen species (ROS) can create a neurotoxic environment driving the progression of AD [1, 27, 55, 63] . Moreover, there is strong evidence supporting the role of inflammatory molecules, such as iNOS, in the initiation of plaque formation due to post-translational modifications of \u0391\u03b2 leading to a faster aggregation [38, 39] . Indeed, counteracting the aggregation process has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy to alleviate the progression of the pathology [67].\nConclusive evidence supporting a direct role of microglia in human neurodegeneration was revealed with the recent advent of massive genome analysis. Specifically, genetic associated studies have identified several AD risk genes strongly associated with the innate immune system, including, among others, triggering receptor on myeloid cells 2 (trem2), cd33, cr1, clu, epha1, ms4a4a/ms4a6a [8, 23]. Recent single cell transcriptomic studies of microglia have pointed out galectin-3 (Lgals3; Gal3) as one of the most attractive molecules in brain innate immunity associated with neurodegeneration (see recent review [11] ). Indeed, Holtzman et al. [30], analyzed transcriptional profiles of isolated microglia from different diseases mouse models, including AD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and aging, and revealed a shared transcriptional network in all conditions, including a strong upregulation of gal3. Interestingly, the authors analyzed the most likely candidates to orchestrate the microglia phenotype activation and found four major hub genes: Lgals3, Igf1, Csf1 and Axl [30] . Two other recent studies characterized the molecular signature of microglial cells associated with different disease conditions including aging and AD [35, 37] . Again, a common microglia neurodegenerative disease-associated phenotype was identified, supporting that i) microglial phenotype is driven by TREM2 and ii) Gal3 was one of the most upregulated genes.\nRecent findings from our group demonstrate that gal3 is released by microglia and acts as a ligand of Toll like Receptor 4 (TLR4), which is one of the canonical receptors involved in the microglia inflammatory response [10] . Based on our previous studies and recent findings from the AD field related to the role of inflammation in the disease, we hypothesize that reduction of microglial activation by"}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, affecting more than 24 million people worldwide [5] and with the incidence of AD increasing dramatically as the global population ages. The removing/inhibiting gal3 will counteract the inflammatory response present in AD and slow the progression of the disease. In this work, we demonstrate i) a significant upregulation of gal3 in human AD patients compared to age-matched healthy controls, ii) the preferential expression of gal3 in microglial cells in contact with A\u03b2 plaques both in human and mouse, iii) a clear reduction of the inflammatory response in microglial cells challenged with A\u03b2 fibrils following gal3 inhibition and gal3 deletion in microglial cultures, iv) a significant A\u03b2 plaque reduction and better cognitive outcome in 5xFAD mice lacking gal3, v) the release of gal3 to the extracellular space and its association to A\u03b2 plaques, vi) the role of gal3 as a cross-seeding agent of A\u03b2 aggregation via its carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) at nanomolar range and vii) the modulation of microglial activation by gal3 by binding to TREM-2 via its CRD domain."}, {"section_title": "MATERIAL AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Animals", "text": "5xFAD-Gal3 KO transgenic mice were generated by crossing heterozygous 5xFAD (+/-) mice with homozygous Gal3KO (-/-) mice to get 5xFAD (+/-)/Gal3 (+/-) mice.

Strikingly, with gal3 inhibition, the downregulation of A\u03b2-induced IDE-1 turned into a significant upregulation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2C, right) . To further confirm our in vitro data, we evaluated the inflammatory response using primary microglial cultures from WT and Gal3KO mice. Primary microglial cultures were challenged with A\u03b242 fibrils at 3 and 10 \u00b5M.\nSimilar to BV2 cells, the lack of gal3 reduced the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL6, IL8\nand TNF\u03b1 (Fig. 2D ).

Transcriptional profiles of hippocampal tissue were obtained by running high-throughput qPCR against a 632-gene mouse inflammation panel. WT and gal3KO mice showed quite similar profiles, suggesting a limited role of gal3 in promoting inflammation in the absence of pathology. In 5xFAD mice, compared to WT, a significant number of genes were affected, especially in 18-month-old mice, in which 125 out of 629 immune genes were highly upregulated. These included complement factor, chemokines, interleukin receptors and toll-like receptors (Suppl. Fig. 4 ). Overall, the whole immune response was highly attenuated in 5xFAD/Gal3KO mice (Suppl.

There was clear age-dependent A\u03b2 deposition in 5xFAD mice (Fig. 4 ). A\u03b2 deposition in aged animals (18 months) was very high, an indication that A\u03b2 clearance becomes saturated in aged 5xFAD mice. Consequently, in order to detect a potential effect of gal3 in A\u03b2 burden, we analyzed the effect of gal3 gene deletion in two well-defined areas, hippocampal CA1 area (high rate of A\u03b2 deposition) and thalamus (low rate of A\u03b2 deposition), in 5xFAD mice at 6 and 18 months. Notably, the plaque burden was significantly reduced in 5xFAD mice lacking gal3 at 6 months at CA1 (Fig. 4A) . At 18 months, we could not find any difference between both groups, probably due to oversaturated plaque deposits in the hippocampi (Fig. 4B ). In agreement with this view, a significant reduction in A\u03b2 plaque deposition was found in the thalamus in 5xFAD/Gal3KO mice at 6 and 18 months compared to aged-matched 5xFAD controls ( Fig. 4A-B ).\nNext, we measured cortical A\u03b242 and A\u03b240 levels from soluble brain fractions. The levels of A\u03b240 were significantly lower in 5xFAD/Gal3KO (vs. 5xFAD) brains at 18 months but not at 6 months ( Fig. 4A-B) .\nConversely, A\u03b242 levels were significantly higher in 5xFAD/Gal3KO (vs. 5xFAD) brains at 6 months ( Fig. 4A ) with no change at 18 months (Fig. 4B ). In the insoluble A\u03b2 fraction, we found reduced A\u03b240 in 5xFAD/Gal3KO at 6 months (Suppl. Fig. 6A ). Changes in A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 levels were not due to a change of APP expression as 5xFAD and 5xFAD/Gal3KO mice showed comparable levels at both ages measured (Suppl. Fig. 6B ). A\u03b2 is cleared from the brain by different mechanisms, including microglia phagocytosis, drainage to the ventricular system and activity of extracellular proteases, such as IDE-1 [26] . We found a significant increase of A\u03b242 CSF levels in 5xFAD/Gal3KO mice compared to 5xFAD mice ( Fig. 4C ), mimicking the clinical situation in which A\u03b2 in the CSF is inversely related to the A\u03b2 plaque load in AD patients. Interestingly, hippocampal IDE-1 levels were increased in 5xFAD/Gal3KO at 6 months compared to 5xFAD (Fig. 4D ), supporting our in vitro data (Fig. 2C ).\nHaving established that gal3 is a main driver of the AD-associated inflammatory response and that gal3 deficiency reduces A\u03b2 plaque burden, we next studied the impact of gal3 deficiency on cognitive behavior. The cognitive ability was evaluated using the Morris water maze memory test. Remarkably, the lack of gal3 in 5xFAD/Gal3KO mice resulted in better cognitive performance compared to 5xFAD mice as the 5xFAD/Gal3KO mice were able to navigate and reach the platform by using a shorter path (Fig.   4E )."}, {"section_title": "Galectin-3 drives microglia reactivity in A\u03b2 plaques", "text": "In view of our findings that gal3-reactive microglia are strictly confined to A\u03b2 plaques and that gal3 deficiency impairs the inflammatory response and A\u03b2 plaque load, we next analyzed microglial coverage on the surface of amyloid plaques in cortex from both 5xFAD and 5xFAD/Gal3KO mice. First, we found that 5xFAD/Gal3KO mice showed reduced Iba1 immunoreactivity in the cortex compared to 5xFAD mice ( Fig. 5A ) with these differences being particularly evident in plaque-associated microglia in 5xFAD/Gal3KO mice (Fig. 5B) . Remarkably, gal3 deficiency significantly reduced Iba1-labeled microglial clusters around A\u03b2 plaques (Fig. 5C ). Analysis of microglia coverage over plaque surface showed that a high subset of plaque-associated microglia (<50%) expressed high levels of gal3 (Fig. 5D ).\nInterestingly, these findings are very similar to those seen in 5xFAD/TREM2KO mice [42, 48, 74] ), in which TREM2 deficiency reduced the capacity of microglia to cluster around A\u03b2 plaques.

We have demonstrated that gal3 is released by reactive microglial cells [10] and may thus interact with different receptors controlling key functions of microglial cells, including TLR4 [47] and MerTK [53] . One of the main pathways altered in 5xFAD/Gal3KO mice was related to DAP12 signaling (Fig. 3B) . Since DAP12 is a downstream regulator of TREM2, we wondered if gal3 could act as an endogenous TREM2 ligand. To test our hypothesis, we first performed TREM2, gal3 and 6E10 staining on 5xFAD brain sections and found i) the majority of TREM2-labelled microglia was gal3 + (83.4 \u00b1 5.7% and 94.0 \u00b1 3.02% at 6 and 18 months, respectively), an indication that gal3 specifically labels the DAM phenotype [80] (Fig. 5E, Suppl. Fig. 7A) , and ii) a striking cellular colocalization of TREM2 and gal3 in microglial cells around A\u03b2 plaques ( Fig. 5E-F, Suppl. Fig. 7A ). We next used quantitative high-resolution confocal microscopy and super-resolution Stochastic Optical\nReconstruction Microscopy (STORM) to determine whether TREM2 and gal3 physically interact using brain sections from 5xFAD mice. Our ultrastructural analysis clearly revealed the physical interaction between gal3 (green) and TREM2 (red) over the membrane surface of microglia (see yellow dots in Fig.   5G ). Further, we incubated brain sections from 5xFAD/Gal3KO with recombinant gal3 to further analyze gal3 binding in situ. This experiment demonstrated the binding of gal3 to TREM2 + but not in TREM2 -/Iba1-labelled microglial cells (Suppl. Fig. 7B ).\nWe further assessed the direct TREM2-gal3 interaction by the potency of soluble TREM2 to inhibit binding of a fluorescent glycosylated probe to gal3 as measured by fluorescence anisotropy. This analysis demonstrated a strong interaction between WT gal3 and TREM2 with a Kd value of 450 \u00b1 90 nM (Fig.   6A ) in the same range as other preferred glycoproteins [12, 13] . A mutant gal3 (R186S, deficient in the carbohydrate binding domain, with severely reduced affinity for LacNAc-structures) [58] bound TREM2 much more weakly (Kd of 5900 \u00b1 600 nM; Fig. 6A ). This means that gal3 interacts strongly with TREM2 protein [Kd in the same range as e.g. some serum glycoproteins such as transferrin and haptoglobin [12, 13] and that the interaction is carbohydrate dependent. The hypothetic interaction was modeled based on previously reported TREM2 and gal3 structures (Suppl. Fig. 7C ). Next, we tested whether gal3 could affect TREM2 signaling using a TREM2-DAP12 reporter cell line, and we found that added gal3 triggered TREM2-DAP12-dependent signaling in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6B ). Overall, our data demonstrate that gal3 is an endogenous ligand for TREM2."}, {"section_title": "Galectin-3 acts as a cross-seeding agent of \u0391\u03b2 aggregation at nanomolar range.", "text": "We have previously demonstrated that gal3 can be released by reactive microglial cells in vitro [10, 53] .\nHowever, to our knowledge, evidence supporting this view in vivo is lacking.

This ultrastructural study first demonstrated that immunogold particles specifically labelled microglial cells in the vicinity of A\u03b2 plaques (Fig. 7A) . Remarkably, immunoelectron microscopy confirmed gal3-labeling in the extracellular space and in A\u03b2 fibrillar aggregates ( Fig. 7B-C) . The presence of extracellular gal3 associated to A\u03b2 fibrillar aggregates is similar to that seen for ASC specks (NLRP3 inflammasome platform), which are released by plaque-associated microglia and induce A\u03b2 cross-seeding [66] . Intriguingly, TREM2 has been associated with A\u03b2 plaque compaction [74] , and, hence, the possibility emerged that gal3 may have a role in A\u03b2 aggregation. We, thus, tested whether gal3 affects aggregation of pure A\u03b2 monomers using a thioflavin T assay, in which thioflavin T fluoresces when bound to beta-sheet-containing aggregates. We used a physiological medium and conditions in which 10\n\u00b5M A\u03b2 aggregated very little over 15 hours, but the addition 1 nM of gal3 increased aggregation as measured by bulk fluorescence (Fig. 7D) or microscopy ( Fig. 7E and F) . The increased thioflavin T fluorescence could be removed by centrifugation (Fig. 7G) , indicating that it was due to the presence of aggregates. Note, that this increased aggregation was at a molar ratio of gal3 to A\u03b2 of 1:10 000, suggesting that gal3 increased nucleation of A\u03b2 aggregation."}, {"section_title": "Galectin-3 induces the formation of insoluble \u0391\u03b2 aggregates following injections of \u0391\u03b2 monomers in the hippocampi of WT mice", "text": "To evaluate if gal3 acts as a cross-seeding agent of A\u03b2 in vivo, A\u03b242 monomers (10 \u00b5M) were incubated alone or in the presence of Gal3 (10 \u00b5M) for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C. Then, 2 \u00b5ls were injected in either the left (A\u03b2+gal3) or the right hippocampi (A\u03b2 alone) of WT mice. The analysis was performed two months postinjection. The injection of A\u03b2 monomers alone failed to show any sign of A\u03b2 aggregation in the injected hippocampi (Fig. 8A) . In sharp contrast and remarkably, the presence of A\u03b2-like plaques were evident in the hippocampi injected with A\u03b2+gal3 (Fig. 8B) . These A\u03b2 aggregates were positive for gal3, A\u03b2 (6E10 antibody) and thioflavin-S (Fig. 8E) , thus demonstrating the amyloid structure of the A\u03b2 deposits.

Our data unequivocally demonstrates that gal3 is a microglial-associated crossseeding agent of A\u03b2 aggregation."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Recent findings suggest an important role of neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases [25] .\nThus, selective mutations in microglia/myeloid-specific genes, including the glycoprotein triggering receptor on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), have been associated with AD [22] . Experimental AD studies have suggested that TREM2 is instrumental in neuroinflammation [32, 43] and drives the recently identified disease-associated microglia (DAM phenotype) [35, 37] . Gal3, a carbohydrate-binding protein, is one of the most upregulated genes associated with DAM [37, 42, 47] . Holtman et al. (2015) anticipated gal3 as an instrumental gene in driving the DAM program [68] . In order to study the role of gal3 in AD pathogenesis, we have analyzed human brains from AD patients and 5xFAD mice lacking gal3. The main conclusions from our study are i) gal3 protein is increased 10-fold in human AD brains and is mostly restricted to plaque-associated microglia in humans and 5xFAD mice, ii) SNPs associated with the gal3 gene are increased in AD patients, iii) gal3 deficiency reduces A\u03b2 plaque burden and overall proinflammatory response and improves cognitive performance in 5xFAD/Gal3KO mice, iv) gal3 is an endogenous TREM2 ligand and v) gal3 acts as a cross-seeding agent of A\u03b2 in vitro and in vivo. Hence, gal3 emerges as a central upstream regulator of AD-associated pathology.\nGiven the relationship between innate immune-related genes and AD incidence [26, 27] , deciphering how A\u03b2 aggregates triggers neuroinflammation is of critical importance. For this purpose, we first analyzed the role of gal3 in A\u03b2-induced inflammatory response in microglial cells. To this end, we took advantage of both chemical inhibition and gene deletion. Gal3 inhibition robustly reduced fA\u03b2induced iNOS expression in BV2 cells, an effect that was extended to proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF\u03b1 and IL6, IL8 and IL12, which we confirmed in primary microglia cultures from WT and Gal3 KO mice. This data suggests that gal3 is a critical alarmin that amplifies the A\u03b2-induced proinflammatory response. Since inefficient clearance of A\u03b2 may play a determinant role in AD pathogenesis [76] , we analyzed the effect of gal3 in two major mechanisms associated to A\u03b2 clearance: fA\u03b2 phagocytosis and IDE-1 levels, a key metalloprotease involved in A\u03b2 degradation by microglia [25, 28, 39] . Gal3 was able to reduce A\u03b2 phagocytosis, and gal3 deficiency increased IDE-1 levels, suggesting a detrimental role of gal3 in A\u03b2 clearance. Overall, our in vitro study demonstrates an instrumental role of gal3 in driving the fA\u03b2-induced pro-inflammatory response and a deleterious effect in A\u03b2 clearance.\nRecent transcriptomic analysis of microglia at the single cell level has identified a common diseaseassociated microglia phenotype, which has been suggested to be driven by TREM2 [35, 37, 47] .\nInterestingly, Krasemann et al. (2017) identified gal3 as one of the most upregulated genes in plaqueassociated microglia, supporting our findings in human AD brains and 5xFAD mice [37] . Recently, Yang and colleagues overexpressed TREM2 in 5xFAD mice (5xFAD/TREM2) and found gal3 as one of the main genes affected by TREM2 overexpression [41] , suggesting that gal3 plays an important role in microglia function under disease conditions. We generated 5xFAD/Gal3KO mice to answer whether gal3 plays a role in microglia-associated AD pathogenesis and to test if gal3 signaling is associated with\nTREM2. To answer this question, we performed an inflammatory gene array, demonstrating an agedependent inflammatory response, including complement components, chemokines, interleukin receptors, toll-like receptors and DAM genes in 5xFAD mice. This inflammatory response was highly attenuated in 5xFAD/Gal3KO mice, thus confirming gal3 as a master regulator of AD-associated brain immune responses. Pathway analysis at 6 and 18 months of age identified TLR and DAP12 (TREM2 adaptor) signaling as the most significant pathway associated to gal3 in the 5xFAD mice. This gene expression data suggests an important role of gal3 in the AD neuroinflammatory response, perhaps by stimulating TLR4 and/or other TLRs [10, 33, 45] or glycoproteins, such as TREM2 [15, 74] , which is implicated in AD-associated immune responses.\nConsequently, we investigated whether gal3 interacts with TREM2, a key receptor suggested to drive the DAM phenotype. Our confocal microscopy study demonstrated a remarkable cellular co-localization of TREM2 and gal3 in microglial cells around A\u03b2 plaques and a near 100% correspondence between both microglial markers, an indication that gal3 specifically labels DAM. STORM microscopy demonstrated that TREM2 and gal3 physically interact on microglial processes, most likely at the cell membranes of DAM microglia. We also incubated sections from 5xFAD/Gal3KO mice with recombinant gal3 to analyze the potential TREM2-binding of extracellular gal3. This assay demonstrated the ability of gal3 to selectively bind to TREM2 + microglia but not to homeostatic microglia. Direct interaction between gal3 CRD and TREM2 was demonstrated by fluorescent anisotropy with a Kd value of 450 \u00b1 90 nM, in the same range as other preferred glycoproteins [12, 13] . The ability of gal3 to stimulate TREM2 was finally confirmed by a TREM2-DAP12 reporter cell line. Overall, we conclude that the switch from homeostatic microglia to DAM is accompanied by a significant upregulation of TREM2 and gal3, which seem to work in concert. We cannot exclude the possibility that gal3 interacts with different microglial receptors including TLR4 [10] , IGFR [40] , MerTK [53] and TREM2 (this study). In fact, because gal3 is relatively promiscuous in its interactions with glycoproteins, it may be behind the chronic and detrimental activation of microglia in AD. Regardless of this possibility, what our study demonstrates is that the pleiotropic activity of gal3 drives the amyloid-associated immune responses.\nAdditionally, our study has uncovered an unexpected role of gal3 as a powerful A\u03b2 cross-seeding agent acting at nanomolar concentrations. We have previously demonstrated the ability of LPS-induced reactive microglia to release gal3 [10, 53] . More recently, we have demonstrated a significant increase of gal3 levels in CSF from mice exposed to traumatic brain injury [73] , an indication that gal3 is released by reactive microglia. In this study, we performed electron microscopy using immunogold gal3 staining to confirm that plaque-associated microglia is the main cellular phenotype expressing gal3 and that gal3 is present in the extracellular space and in A\u03b2 fibrillar aggregates. This suggested the possibility that gal3 released from reactive microglia may seed A\u03b2 aggregation. Indeed, pure gal3 accelerated the aggregation of pure A\u03b2 at a ratio 1:10 000, a clear indication that it acts as an endogenous cross-seeding agent of A\u03b2 fibrillation. Imaging and co-sediment experiments performed after incubations between A\u03b2 and gal3 confirmed the amyloid aggregating effect of gal3.\nTo further demonstrate that gal3 acts as an A\u03b2 cross-seeding agent in vivo, we injected A\u03b2 monomers with or without gal3 into the hippocampi of WT mice; each side of the hippocampi was injected with either A\u03b2 monomers alone or A\u03b2 monomers and gal3. A\u03b2 deposition was analyzed two months after injections. While no A\u03b2 deposition was found in animals injected with A\u03b2 monomers alone, co-injection of A\u03b2 monomers and gal3 resulted in evident, insoluble A\u03b2 aggregates, a clear demonstration that gal3 is acting as a strong A\u03b2 cross-seeding agent. To induce A\u03b2 aggregates by injecting A\u03b2 species in vivo, an AD mouse model is typically a prerequisite [19] . Kim et al. injected A\u03b2 peptides in normal mice, inducing AD-like cognitive deficits [36] . However, they did not demonstrate the formation of plaques in the injected area.\nRecently, Heneka and colleagues have demonstrated that ASC specks released from reactive microglia physically interacts with A\u03b2, acting as an A\u03b2 cross-seeding agent (Venegas et al., 2017) .\nEliminating microglia has been shown to prevent plaque formation in APP transgenic mice [Sosna et al 2018; PMID: 29490706], suggesting that factors released from microglia may seed amyloid plaques. Our study reinforces the view that reactive microglia play a critical role in A\u03b2 aggregation and associated immune response by releasing A\u03b2 cross-seeding agents (i.e. ASC specks and gal3). A\u03b2 fibrillation is believed to precede the appearance of clinical symptoms and, hence, elucidating the earlier molecular mechanism involved in plaque formation appears critical for the establishment of promising therapeutic strategies aimed at stopping the development of AD at the first step. Gal3-inhibition emerges as a promising A\u03b2 therapeutic target. The ability of gal3 to drive pro-inflammatory fA\u03b2-associated immune responses, cross-seed A\u03b2 and hinder A\u03b2 clearance points (i.e. phagocytosis and IDE-1 levels) makes this protein a strategic upstream regulator of AD pathology. Indeed, the pathogenic role of gal3 was confirmed in adult 5xFAD mice lacking gal3 as those mice had a significantly lower A\u03b2 load and ameliorated cognitive/spatial memory deficits as studied by the Morris water maze test.\nOur results suggest that LGALS3 gene variants affect the risk to develop AD, as indicated by the 5 SNPs in the LGALS3 gene that we found to be related to increased AD frequency. However, according to the GWAS catalogue (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/), none of the variants reported in Suppl. Table 3 or those in linkage disequilibrium with them (Suppl. Fig. 3B ), have been previously associated with AD. This could be due to the fact that the GWAS approach requires large samples to detect modest effects, partly due to the multiple testing corrections applied. However, the impact of these LGALS3 SNPs appear to be similar to other SNPs included in the GWAS, supporting a role of this gene in the development of AD.\nOur meta-analysis only comprised those SNPs belonging to a linkage disequilibrium block located at the 5\u00b4 end of LGALS3 gene, and, therefore, we do not know if other regions could have genetic variants showing stronger effects. Further replication studies covering the entire genetic region of this locus will be necessary to confirm our results."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In conclusion, we provide evidence that gal3 is a central upstream regulator of microglial immune response in AD. It drives pro-inflammatory activation of microglia in response to fA\u03b2 along with impairment of fA\u03b2 degradation and clearance. Our study has additionally uncovered two exciting features of gal3 disease biology that appears important in AD pathogenesis. First, gal3 is an endogenous TREM2 ligand, a key receptor driving microglial activation in AD. Second, nanomolar concentrations of gal3 cross-seeds A\u03b2 aggregation in vitro and in vivo. As a result, gal3 inhibition may be a potential pharmacological approach to counteract AD at multiple stages of the disease.
