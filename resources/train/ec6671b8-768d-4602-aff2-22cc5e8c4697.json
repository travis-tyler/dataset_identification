[{"section_title": "", "text": "The Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) conducted annually by the US Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service (ERS) collects data on US agriculture, ranging from production practices to the financial condition of farm and ranch enterprises and the farm household. The ARMS is used to meet a variety of agricultural and environmental policy needs. It is also the primary vehicle for analysis of the effect of changes in agricultural policy and other factors on the financial condition of the farm sector. Unfortunately, the ARMS has never been of much use to farmers and ranchers. This glaring omission, not serving the needs of the very people from whom the data are collected, has two components: first, not collecting data that could be of use to agricultural producers and, second, not tabulating and reporting results in a form that would be useful to producers and their households. This article considers what could make ARMS useful from a farmer's point of view. In the most part, this involves discussing what is not being done at present and providing observations on how those gaps could be filled. The discussion falls into two sections. The first notes shortcomings of the current survey. The major points to be addressed include identifying potentially useful data that are not being gathered now, plus current weaknesses in the sampling frame of the survey. The second section will identify shortcomings of the current reporting of survey results. The discussion here does not concern why any shortcomings may exist. It is taken as given that there is an ever-present budget constraint on the entire ARMS project, and that the list of objectives for which the ARMS was originally created to meet is changing and expanding. We argue that an important addition to that list is the need to serve agricultural producers' desire for a clear understanding of their industry's present condition and future prospects. We believe that objective can be fulfilled through some nearly costless modifications to the ARMS which will greatly expand its value as a management tool for producers across the country."}, {"section_title": "Shortcomings of the current survey", "text": "Increasing the usability of the ARMS to agricultural producers involves expanding the content and relevance of the data collected. This article seeks to raise the issue of how to accomplish both these goals. First, the next section identifies possible \"forward looking\" indicators that could be generated to forecast possible emerging difficulties in the sector. The second section discusses how the usefulness and relevance of the data could be increased by refining the sample frame."}, {"section_title": "Data of value to farmers", "text": "The best way to identify what data would be of value to farmers and ranchers is to ask them. Given the time and budget constraints of this project, we opted instead to ask a small number of experts that work with agricultural producers. In formal terms, we conducted a Delphi method survey of experts during 2011. One author contacted about a dozen senior industry observers and asked for their thoughts on leading financial indicators of the future performance of the agricultural sector. The responses of the experts are summarized below in ten numbered bullet points, each of which focuses on a different general topic. We present the comments for readers to see the diversity of concerns raised by the panel of experts. Following the comments, we discuss the indicators mentioned and present some ideas on how the indicators could be calculated and presented as part of the ARMS program. Comments on leading indicators of agriculture's performance: (1) Good times never last and neither do bad times. Agriculture is a cyclical business, although it often runs counter to the general economy. It is always important to remember that the function of a competitive market is to drive the economic return to the average producer to economic breakeven through supply and demand responses in both input and output markets. In equilibrium, the top-end producers are profitable and growing, the average are hanging in there, and the bottom end are losing money and being forced to exit the industry. Business success and survival depend on continuous improvement at a pace necessary to stay out of the back of the pack. (2) Use accrual adjusted income, not cash basis to evaluate profitability. Cash basis income is great for simplicity and tax management, but it is a poor way to measure the true profitability of a business. The Farm Financial Standards Council has recognized for over 20 years that cash basis income often lags accrual Keeping ARMS relevant by two to three years in terms of recognizing both downturns and upturns in profitability. That's often too late to respond. Cash basis income tends to reflect more income smoothing as inventories, receivables, payables, accrued expenses, prepaids, and capital maintenance and replacement are adjusted to even out cash flows and taxable income. Measuring accrual adjusted profitability does not require an accrual accounting system; it simply requires having balance sheets prepared as of the beginning and end of the period for which cash basis income is measured. The balance sheets need to include inventories, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued expenses. From there the adjustment process is a matter of arithmetic because changes in the value of non-current assets (e.g. land) and non-current liabilities are not used in the accrual income adjustment process. Accrual adjusted income estimates are possible if cohort \"representative\" farms are developed based on the ARMS data. (3) Margins are more important than absolute commodity and input price levels. For that reason, trends in the operating expense rate or gross margins on an accrual basis are leading indicators. Some analysts track the rate of revenue growth and the rate of growth of operating expenses separately. (4) The past three years in commodity, real estate, and financial markets have made it abundantly clear that changes can occur quickly. We have also learned that Black Swan events are real. The tails of economic and financial distributions are larger than the assumptions of a normal distribution. Most risk models capture only \"normal\" periods, and that includes the rating services such as Moody's, Dun and Bradstreet, and Standard & Poor's. This experience has several lessons that need to be heeded in the future: . Econometric models tend to be data dependent and backward looking. Boards and managers need to rely on judgment and experience and learn to look for leading indicators outside their immediate environment. . Total enterprise risk management is critical, but implementing it is both expensive and easier said than done. Even the most sophisticated financial institutions are still basically silo risk managers. . Although linear trends are good indicators of behavior and performance, they seriously understate the potential rate of change created by the external environment, including the impact of technological change. Tipping points often cause exponential rather than linear changes for both upturns and downturns. Timing is critical -for getting in, expanding, cutting back or getting out or redeploying resources. Timing is the main difference that separates the top 10 percent from the rest of the top 25 percent of managers and businesses. (5) The change in earned net worth is a better indicator of sustainable growth than the change in market value net worth, where earned net worth change is a function of net earnings after taxes and after withdrawals. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the earned net worth for many farmers was declining even though their market value ne worth was increasing because land appreciation was outpacing operating losses. (6) Working capital and liquidity are becoming more important. Cash may be king, but a business can be making payments and going broke by refinancing, selling AFR 72,2 assets, building accounts payable and deferring the replacement of capital assets. So staying current on payments may not be enough by itself to keep borrowers' loans out of trouble. The Farm Financial Standards Council and others have found that the ratio of net working capital/gross revenues is a much better measure of liquidity in agriculture than the traditional current ratio. 7The interest expense ratio and the term debt coverage ratio are often overlooked leading indicators. While interest rates have kept the ratio low in recent years, it is subject to very rapid change. Those who are highly leveraged or end up with carryover debt from operating losses can spiral down quickly with an increase in rates. This has become more true as lenders have moved to variable and adjustable rates, and shorter re-pricing periods to mitigate their own risks associated with asset: liability pricing and match funding. The term debt coverage ratio reflects the impact of farmers' tendency to make large capital purchases and take on term debt during periods of high income that involve fixed debt servicing commitments which continue into periods when income turns down. The problems in low income periods are compounded by capital investments made primarily to minimize taxes or based on the assumption that good periods will last indefinitely. (8) Macroeconomic indicators, both domestic and global, need more emphasis in terms of serving as early warning indicators for the health of the agricultural sector. For example: . The US rate of GDP growth. . The rate of GDP growth in the emerging Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC) nations. . The exchange rate for the US dollar as it impacts commodity exports and imports, as well as the cost of imported inputs -fuel, fertilizer. . The US unemployment rate given the growing dependence of farm households on off-farm income. . Domestic housing starts. (9) Unfortunately, markets tend to overreact on both the upside and downside. Alan Greenspan referred to this response as irrational exuberance/fear and said that 80 percent of market economics are psychology. Experience has shown that when it comes to predicting financial problems, the debt:income ratio is a much better leading indicator than the debt:asset ratio. For example, the debt:income ratio indicated problems starting to develop in 1977, while the debt:asset ratio did not start reflecting any negative until 1981. (10) The ultimate financial impact on the financial health of agricultural sector is determined by, and reflected in, land values. The basic reason is that 87 percent of total farm assets are in real estate. With the increase in land values in recent years the total debt:asset ratio for the agricultural sector is at historically low levels, but the number can be very deceiving. First, 70 percent of farm operations carry no debt. The use of credit is more concentrated among capital intensive and larger operations that depend primarily on farm income for debt repayment. Most of the shift away from debt over the last ten years has occurred in farms and ranches generating less than $500,000 annual gross sales. Add to this the fact Keeping ARMS relevant that 42 percent of land in farms is owned by non-operator landlords and of the 58 percent owned by farm operators, 61.3 percent is owned by farmers with less than $250,000 annual gross sales. Because both the net worth and the underlying collateral for many farm loans, even operating loans, is real estate and because the majority of farm debt and farm income is concentrated on commercial scale farms and ranches, the value of land is critical to the risk of loss in the event of default faced by agricultural lenders. The market value of land is determined at the margin -the prices of land sold. If farm income drops and debt servicing problems occur, forced sales will increase. If able buyers get nervous about reduced incomes prospects and believe land values could fall, they will sit on the sidelines. This would exacerbate the problem and land values would fall even further. Changes in land values obviously are not evenly distributed. Land type, use, quality and location differ significantly, and so will the market impacts. Leading indicators of agriculture's financial performance that were mentioned in the ten bulleted points above are presented in Table I in the approximate order they appear in the bullets. In the right-side column of the table are listed ways in which the indicator calculated from ARMS data could be presented so as to provide a management tool that was useful to agricultural producers. (Presentation methods will be discussed further in a later section of this article.) Certainly other indicators could be added to the list, but those in Table I were mentioned by the experts because these indicators have proven in the past to be of value in forecasting agriculture's economic performance. The first indicator listed in Table I, return on equity (ROE), is offered as an addition to return on assets (ROA) which is currently calculated in the ARMS data. Both of these indicators measure the reward being earned by a farmer (as an investor) in a form that is comparable to the returns being earned in any sector of the economy. The next indicator, gross margins, is another measure of profitability. It could be calculated and reported in terms of dollars per acre and/or in percentage terms. The \"total enterprise risk\" indicator can be calculated from the data tabulated for any aggregate group, such as all ARMS respondents from a particular state. We suggest that it be calculated as the coefficient of variation using the standard deviation of income per acre operated for all farms in the aggregate group and the income per acre for the respondent farm. This indicates the relative risk position of each respondent compared to the aggregate sample of respondents (Blank, 2008, p. 242 for details on CVs). This is a more-direct measure of an operation's risk than many of the proxies being used in the economics literature (Bellemare and Brown, 2010;Jensen and Pope, 2004). One of the experts mentioned \"linear trends\" as a useful economic indicator. We suggest that an indicator of change in average income be presented. It could be calculated simply as the change in this year's ARMS data compared to the previous year's results for some aggregate group, such as all farmers in a state. Creating this new indicator would not require additional questions in the ARMS, only a program linking the results from consecutive years of ARMS data [1]. The same link between years is all that would be required to create the indicator called \"earned net worth.\" Showing the change in average net worth from the previous year's results for an aggregate group directly shows an important aspect of economic performance. Changes in \"earned net worth\" for representative \"cohort\" farms would be calculated by starting with accrual adjusted net income less cash basis taxes paid, adjusting for changes in accrued income taxes and the current portion of deferred taxes, then subtracting withdrawals, i.e. generally family living. Even if deferred tax information is not collected, it would be more useful than what is now available. Four different ratios mentioned by the experts could be calculated from the ARMS data already collected, each serving as a useful tool in financial analysis of agriculture's performance, while not affecting the data collection process or cost. Those ratios are net working capital to gross revenue, debt to income, the interest expense ratio, and income to land value. Finally, the experts' discussion of farmland values in bullet 10 above raises a point made by Blank (2008, pp. 171-207), that the economic performance of agriculture is reflected in land prices. Thus, farmland values are a good indicator of the economic health of a local or regional production sector. Therefore, it is listed at the bottom of Table I. Farmland value is an important indicator of economic performance for at least a couple reasons. First, farmland values are directly linked to the income being generated on that land. That relationship is shown in the traditional income capitalization model. It is one of many explanations that economists have developed for what has been driving farmland values. As presented by Gloy et al., this model: [. . .] expresses current farmland values as a function of current income produced by farmland, the opportunity cost of capital or discount rate, and the constant rate at which income is expected to grow in the future. As expressed in equation 1 Clearly, income that can be generated on a parcel of farmland is expected to be the main driver of that farmland's value, but the discount rate is an often-overlooked factor of great importance. Finally, the third component -the income growth rate -\"is the rate at which the returns to farmland are expected to grow\" which is assumed to be \"constant into perpetuity\" (Gloy et al., 2011). In summary, this simple model shows that farm income and interest rates are each expected to influence farmland values. In other words, farmland values are a good indicator of the interaction of farm incomes, interest rates, and producers' expectations of future performance of both of those economic variables in the geographic area. The second reason that farmland values are a useful indicator of agriculture's economic performance is that those values are a major component of farm household wealth (Koenigstein and Lins, 1990;Blank et al., 2004Blank et al., , 2009. As noted in bullet 10 above, land represents a majority of farmers' wealth and that wealth impacts a farmer's ability to borrow to cover short-term operating expenses or to make long-term capital investments. Thus, it would be helpful to calculate both the current levels of farmland values and the change in values from the previous year. Also, we believe it would be a useful comparison to see what farmland values are collected in the ARMS so those values can be cross-checked with values reported by the National Agricultural Statistical Service (Goodwin et al., 2003)."}, {"section_title": "Sample frame issues", "text": "This section discusses how the usefulness and relevance of the ARMS data could be increased by refining the sample frame. To be of maximum value to all American agricultural producers, the ARMS needs to be converted from a limited-intent analysis policy tool to a true national survey of the agricultural sector. Shortcomings involving the sampling frame are currently the biggest impediments to such a transformation. Therefore, two topics are addressed briefly here: states included and respondents included. The ARMS was created originally in response to Congress' requirement that production cost data be collected for wheat, feed grains, cotton, and dairy and the states included in the sample frame still reflect that limited focus. As a result, ARMS does not collect data from a representative sample of American agriculture. This can be seen in Table II created in an early attempt to identify geographical areas with similar agricultural production systems and commodity outputs. When developing the sampling frame for ARMS, the ERS combined the ten regions into five -listed in the second column of Table II -from which a sample of states was selected. Those 15 \"Core states\" -listed in the third column of Table II -are the only ones in which surveys are conducted. In other words, the ARMS sample frame was built from a stratified sample with the strata being identified as states in the regions dominated by the production of the commodities targeted in the legislation. The respondents are selected randomly from within each state selected. This process succeeded in generating a sample of respondents that provided a good cross section of production cost data for the targeted commodities (which was the original intent of ARMS), but it generated little data on other commodities or geographical regions. As can be seen in the last column in Table II, the 15 Core states are not distributed in a representative fashion across the country. For example, ARMS collects data from six of the eight states in the \"Midwest\" survey region, which includes two of the three states in the ERS' Lake States production region and four of the five states in the Corn Belt. Conversely, only North Carolina is surveyed from the 16 states in the Atlantic, and only two states are included from the 11 making up the West survey region. Questions about the representativeness of data gathered from such a limited sample frame are inevitable. In the West, for example, only California and Washington are included; no state from the large \"Mountain\" production region is surveyed. Given that the Mountain region has a majority of the country's large livestock operations (Blank, 2008, pp. 73-5), omitting all of those states from the ARMS creates real bias in the data collected regarding livestock production and costs. The second aspect of the ARMS sample frame needing change concerns the representativeness of the people included. A large body of literature shows that economic performance varies across both farm size and commodity specialization. Thus, to adequately capture an accurate picture of the performance of producers within a state or region, ARMS needs a representative sample of people drawn from among the size and commodity strata. At present there are at least two problems regarding these aspects of the sample frame. First is the fact that the current 15 Core states being surveyed do not generate representative samples across commodities. For example, the Mountain region, which is not surveyed, has large livestock operations while the Midwest, which is over-represented in ARMS, has mostly small grain operations. Second, the current ARMS sample creates what ERS calls a \"respondent burden\" for very large farms in that the few operations of that size are surveyed in more years than are individual operations of smaller scale. Attention to sample frame development could reduce this problem. Finally, the respondent burden for large-scale farm operators could be reduced and the usefulness of the data could be increased by tailoring the survey instrument to specific farm sizes, tracing the use of questions based on relevance, and rewording questions that are difficult to conceptualize. The farm size descriptive categories used currently are at least 20 years out of date. This is a major shortcoming in the usefulness of the ARMS data. Therefore, we propose new descriptive categories based on their shares of the annual gross farm sales distribution, as presented in Table III. These sales categories would be much more reflective of the current industry structure, based on the distribution of total farm sales generated by farms in each of these strata."}, {"section_title": "Keeping ARMS relevant", "text": "Shortcomings of current reporting of survey results Due to its original purpose as a policy development and analysis tool, ARMS data are available only to government employees; no public reporting of its results is done on a regular basis [2]. This virtually eliminates the possibility that farmers and ranchers can benefit directly from the ARMS project. However, the ARMS could easily be one of the most useful and important management tools available to the agricultural production sector if ARMS data were used to create a summary report published annually. Published ARMS data could become the \"Dun and Bradstreet\" report for agriculture. By that we mean the ARMS project could create and disseminate reports that show agriculture's demographics and relative performance standards across the distribution of farm and ranch sizes for each region and commodity. People in industries outside of agriculture can use reports by Dun and Bradstreet, Moody's, Standard & Poor's, and other financial reporting firms to evaluate the performance of an individual firm. People in agriculture cannot do so as effectively because representative farm and ranch level data are not available. However, the ARMS project could be a source of such data if the sample frame limitations noted earlier are adequately resolved. Then all that needs to happen is to report a tabulation of the data. A report of the most recent year's ARMS data would provide agricultural households with a picture of the industry's current performance, while adding some simple tabulation of the data could turn the information into a tool for anticipating the industry's near-term performance. And, probably more importantly, these summary reports could provide managers with objective economic performance measures for use as a diagnostic tool for their operations. For example, a summary for a local area (e.g. state or region) could report the highest, lowest, 25, 50, and 75 percent level observations for each variable. Agricultural producers could use this data tabulation to judge their own performance relative to their commodity industry and/or region. Some examples of how to present some tabulated data are suggested in Table I's right column. Possible methods of presenting ARMS data are many, but we suggest that all should focus on showing aspects of the distribution of the data collected for each question. This could be as simple as listing the quartile observations between the highest and lowest values collected. However, to help report users see linear trends in the data, some time series data tables should be considered. For example, a table could show farmland values for a number of years by programming the retrieval of ARMS data from previous surveys. It also might be useful to present nominal time series data adjusted into real terms to better present economic performance trends over time by making it possible to compare both series side-by-side. Certain types of data tabulations would be especially useful in enabling analysts to identify changes in the composition of agriculture. In particular, we recommend that cropping patterns receive much attention across the country by presenting summaries Category Sales Very small ,$10,000 Small $10,000-$249,999 Medium $250,000-$999,999 Large $1,000,000-$4,999,999 Very large $ $5,000,000 Table III. Descriptive categories AFR 72,2 of the \"crop portfolios\" reported by individual operations. Since few operators produce just one commodity (Blank, 2001), ARMS's original focus on the production costs of only a limited list of crops is no longer sufficient. Policy makers need to be aware of operators' efforts to improve their profitability by producing a portfolio of commodities (Nalley et al., 2009). In summary, the multi-million dollar ARMS project does a good job of gathering data that would be of use to farmers and ranchers, but no public reporting of the survey results is being done other than the small amount that appears in a limited number of publications generated by ERS employees and their academic colleagues. It is argued here that after making some adjustments to the ARMS sample frame to create nationally representative data, the ARMS project could serve as a hugely important basis for reporting economic performance levels for American agriculture. Plus, we believe the additional cost of tabulating and reporting that data would be minor compared to the current budget for ARMS, thus producing a significant return on the government's investment in this project by enabling farmers and ranchers to improve their operations. Such a change involves an expansion of the limited goals being pursued by the ARMS project currently, but the change would expand the usefulness and value of the ARMS enormously."}, {"section_title": "Notes", "text": "1. Obviously, there would be issues created by changes in the questionnaires or how the data is imputed or edited. The point here is to suggest how ARMS could be made more useful. Users need to be able to assume some consistency and comparability, or there are limited conclusions about expectations that can be drawn from the year-to-year information. 2. Raw ARMS data are not public due to confidentiality. However, the ERS Web Tool is public and the ERS also has \"Briefing rooms\" on its web site and publications that draw on ARMS data."}]
