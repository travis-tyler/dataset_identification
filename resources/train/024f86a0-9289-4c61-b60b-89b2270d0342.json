[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been extensively used to map changes in brain tissue related to neurological disorders. Among the most widespread DTI findings are increased mean diffusivity and decreased fractional anisotropy of white matter tissue in neurodegenerative diseases. We show that unincorporated anisotropic free water in perivascular space (PVS) significantly, and systematically, biases DTI measures, casting new light on the biological validity of many previously reported findings. Despite the challenge this poses for interpreting these past results, our findings suggest a new opportunity for incorporating the PVS contribution into diffusion MRI metrics of tissue changes, ultimately strengthening the clinical and scientific value of diffusion MRI.\nHCP: Data were provided [in part]"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Diffusion MRI is sensitive to water displacement, a physical process that is useful for characterizing structural and orientational features of brain tissue 1, 2 . Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) 3 is the most popular diffusion MRI modeling technique which has been widely used to study brain in health and disease [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Over the past 30 years, many studies reported DTI-derived measures, such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), in neurological diseases. A reproduced and well-known example is the observation of increased MD and decreased FA in neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's disease [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . These findings were often interpreted as the outcome of the white matter degeneration which leads to extra free space for water to displace in every direction, and therefore higher MD and lower FA (i.e. DTI findings are often interpreted as the pathological microstructural alterations of the white matter tissue). However, there remain major concerns regarding the validity of the interpretations. Neuronal degeneration is not the only occurring process, and other pathological changes related to increased glia, presence of Tau tangles and amyloid plaques 28 , may even hinder water displacement, and plausibly lower water diffusivity.\nPerivascular space (PVS), also known as Virchow-Robin space, is a pial-lined, fluid-filled structure that accompany vessels entering (penetrating arteries) or leaving (draining veins) cerebral cortex 29, 30 . Due to the expansive vascularity of the brain, PVS occupies a large portion of the cerebral tissue 31 (Figure 1.a and 1.b) . PVS volume varies across people, enlarges with aging as brain tissue shrinks, and changes in many neurological diseases 29, [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . Structurally speaking, PVS has a microscopic tubular geometry that occupies extra-vascular space, with decreasing diameter as it penetrates deeper into the brain tissue. Therefore, unlike brain tissue, water molecules of PVS freely move in the microscopic scale, yet they are hindered by the vessel and the cerebral tissue in macroscopic scale. High-resolution MRI and post-mortem studies have shown that PVS in white matter has microscopic scale tubular structure with small diameter that was observed throughout the brain 40, 41 , This morphological characteristics will result in anisotropic water displacement within this compartment. Based on physical properties of water motion and MRI scanner sensitivities, diffusion profile of PVS fluid appears isotropic only when the diameter of the PVS is larger than the amount of water displacement during the diffusion encoding time and becomes anisotropic when the diameter of the PVS decreases in size.\nWhen DTI measures are estimated, the derived measure reflects the diffusion properties of both the tissue and fluid from the PVS. Given the relatively fast diffusivity of the water expected in PVS, even a small portion of PVS in an imaging voxel can have a substantial effect on the voxel averaged DTI measures, due to the partial volume effect 42 . Our experiments demonstrate that a failure to incorporate this fluid compartment can impose a systematic bias in DTI findings. For example, in a brain tissue with a given DTI characteristic, if the amount of PVS increases (Figure 1.c) , DTI modeling would result in an increased MD and decreased FA. While disrupted tissue microstructure is often cited when changes in DTI parameters are observed, the bias imposed by changes in PVS fluid provides a hypothetical but compelling alternative explanation for many reported findings in DTI studies of neurodegenerative diseases."}, {"section_title": "Figure 1. (a) Schematic view of the perivascular space (PVS). (b)", "text": "High-resolution turbo spin echo images of two healthy volunteers (above: 32yr old female, below: 56yr old female), scanned at 7T. In-plane resolution of 0.3mm (interpolated to 0.15mm) was used to acquire the data (with the slice thickness of 2mm). Four averages were acquired to ensure high signal-to-noise ratio. Note that PVS presents throughout the white matter, with larger diameter PVSs closer to the cortex and smaller diameter as it penetrates deep into the white matter. Systematic bias from PVS on DTI was simulated for the mean diffusivity (c) and fractional anisotropy (d). As PVS increases the amount of bias amplifies. Free-water elimination (DTI-FWE) technique is also included, which is also affected by PVS presence but to a smaller extent. A plot of diffusion MRI signal for 3 different examples of mean diffusivity (d=1 \u00b5m 2 /ms, blue line; d=1.2 \u00b5m 2 /ms, blue dashed line; and d=3 \u00b5m 2 /ms, red line) is illustrated in (e) and the log of the signal is plotted in (f). Note that an increased mean diffusivity from 1 \u00b5m 2 /ms to 1.2 \u00b5m 2 /ms has a similar signal profile as a scenario with no increased diffusivity but 20% of PVS presence (i.e. PVS signal fraction of 0.2; black line)."}, {"section_title": "Results and Discussion", "text": "We simulated diffusion MR signal in a white matter voxel by changing the amount of PVS.\nSimulation experiments show how FA and MD of the tissue, when modeled using DTI, deviate from the tissue ground truth values, as the amount of PVS increases (Figure 1 .e and 1.f). For example, a 20% increase in PVS signal contribution would result in a same signal change if the tissue MD increases from 1 to 1.2 \u00b5m 2 /ms. Our simulations show that even a model incorporating an isotropic free water compartment, i.e. without incorporating fluid anisotropy, could still systematically bias results in the same direction as the DTI bias. Although the scale of this bias is significantly lower (Figure 1.c and 1.d) .\nA remedy to address this bias is to consider two tensors in a voxel 43 , one for the tissue and one for the PVS so that both isotropic and anisotropic PVS areas can be modeled. Indeed, the diffusivity of the PVS fluid is higher than the white matter tissue, a prior knowledge which can help separate two compartments in the fitting stage. We used this approach to separate PVS and the tissue. For clarity, the images relating to the tissue are called tissue tensor images (TTI), which were used to investigate the bias of the DTI. DTI reflects the voxel values, but TTI reflects tissue values and are referred to accordingly. It should be noted that a diffusion MRI acquisition with multiple b-values is required (multi-shell diffusion MRI) 43 for multi-compartment modeling of brain tissue.\nWe investigated the influence of the PVS on the DTI-derived maps first on a single subject and then on a large cohort of 861 healthy subjects. Subject-level investigation showed that the MD map of DTI was significantly affected by PVS contribution (Figure 2 showed to affect the regional values (Figure 2.f) . Values of all WM regions were significantly different between DTI and TTI (all differences were significant at < 0.001 level).\nTo determine whether this effect is generalized across individuals, we characterized the DTI bias in a typical adult population by quantitatively examining 861 healthy subjects from human connectome project (HCP) (Figure 3 ) 44 Then we specifically examined how the PVS DTI bias affects the study of neurodegeneration using data from the ADNI-3 project 45 . Results from ADNI-3 subjects with multi-shell diffusion MRI data were in-line with simulation and HCP data results (Figure 4) . It should be noted that voxels of the ADNI-3 diffusion MRI data are 4.1 times larger than that from HCP data, yet the influence of the PVS on the MD map was clearly apparent ( An example group-level analysis was performed on the ADNI-3 data to judge if the findings differ when we incorporate a PVS contribution. When comparing MD values of CN and MCI groups using DTI, fifteen regions were significantly different after correcting for multiple comparison using Benjamini-Hochberg procedure 46 and with the false discovery rate of 0.1 (age, sex and brain size were included in the regression). These regions and the statistics are reported in Supplemental note 2. When TTI was used, or when the signal fraction of the PVS was included in the regression, none of those regions were significant.\nFor additional insight, we further investigated one of the regions with significantly different MD value between CN and MCI from the DTI study, namely the superior fronto-occipital fasciculus. It has been shown that by Several techniques and previous studies have included free water in diffusion tensor modeling 43, [47] [48] [49] [50] or aimed to eliminate it by modifying the imaging sequence 51 , mainly to address the CSF partial volume effect around the ventricles. Most of these studies used a fixed-diffusivity isotropic diffusion model and/or treated PVS fluid as a factor to eliminate. Here we emphasize that 1) PVS is not an isotropic compartment and presents throughout the white matter, and 2) Efforts to eliminate fluid contributions may not be the right approach, as parameters obtained from this compartment could be an imaging signal of significant scientific value. For example, Taoka et al. recently showed that diffusivity along the perivascular space may reflect impairment of the glymphatic system 52 . The extent to which these findings may be affected by the choice of the model is yet to be examined.\nPVS can be mapped with high-resolution T2-weighted imaging only in some voxels where PVS contribution is above the contrast-to-noise ratio 46 . It can however be fully mapped and water elimination (DTI-FWE) 47 models were fitted to the data, and finally diffusion parameters were extracted from the fitted models."}, {"section_title": "High-resolution 7T images", "text": "High-resolution T2-weighted images were acquired to visualize PVS in fine detail. Two healthy adult females (32 and 56 years old) were scanned on a 7 Tesla (7T), whole-body scanner (Terra, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) using a single-channel quadrature transmit radiofrequency (RF) coil and a 32-channel receive array coil (Nova Medical Inc., MA). The institutional review board of the University of Southern California approved the study.\nInformed consent was obtained from the volunteers, and the image datasets were anonymized.\nT2-weighted using turbo-spin echo sequences with in-plane resolution of 300 \u00b5m (interpolated to 150 \u00b5m) and 2 mm slice thickness were collected.

With echo time of 73 ms, repetition time of 3.5 s and total of 25 slices, the acquisition time was 12 minutes."}, {"section_title": "HCP data and analysis", "text": "To evaluate the effect of PVS on DTI measures, we downloaded structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data provided by the Human Connectome Project (HCP) 44 We used preprocessed data using methods detailed previously, which were preprocessed using HCP pipelines [55] [56] [57] . In brief: the structural images were corrected for gradient nonlinearity, readout, and bias field; aligned to AC-PC \"native\" space and averaged when multiple runs were available; then registered to MNI 152 space using FSL 58 's FNIRT. The native space images were used to generate individual white and pial surfaces 55 using the FreeSurfer software 59 and the HCP pipelines 55, 56 . FSL's TOPUP was used to correct for B0-inhomogeneity distortion using two opposing phase encoded images 60 . FSL's EDDY was used to correct for current induced field inhomogeneity and subject head motion 61 , followed by correction for the gradient nonlinearity. Diffusion data were registered to the structural T1-weighted AC-PC space using the non-diffusion-weighted volume. The diffusion gradient vectors were rotated accordingly.\nDTI, DTI-FWE and tissue tensor imaging (TTI) models were fitted to HCP subjects using Quantitative Imaging Toolkit (QIT) 62 . For a robust estimation of DTI measure, the shell with the b-value of 1000 s/mm 2 was separated and the tensor model was fitted to each voxel of the volume using a non-linear least square fitting routine. DTI-FWE model fitting was performed using a custom implementation of the procedure described by Hoy et al. 63 , in which the fluid compartment is assigned a constant diffusivity of 3 \u00b5m 2 /s and the optimal signal fraction parameter is determined through a grid search with linear least squares of the tissue tensor compartment at each grid point. The TTI model fitting was performed using constrained trustregion derivative-free optimization using Powell's BOBYQA algorithm 64 . TTI fitting was initialized with the parameters obtained from the DTI-FWE model, and TTI parameters were constrained as follows: the signal fraction was required to be between zero and one, the fluid compartment was required to be axially symmetric fluid compartment with positive diffusivities and have an axis aligned to the tissue principal direction, and the tissue compartment was constrained to be positive definite using a re-parameterization with the Cholesky decomposition.\nDiffusion MRI-derived measures were compared in different areas of the white matter: in voxels with high PVS signal fraction and then in four atlas-driven regions of the white matter that are known to have varying PVS appearance in healthy adults 31 , namely: corpus callosum (low PVS appearance), para-hippocampus (intermediate PVS appearance), centrum semiovale (high PVS appearance), and superior-frontal part of the white matter (an additional randomly selected region). White matter voxels with high PVS appearance were selected from highresolution structural images. We noted that the \"T1-weighted divided by T2-weighted\" images, provided as part of the HCP release, can clearly highlight voxels with high PVS presence. The additional clarity is because fluid appears hyperintense in T2-weighted images and hypointense in T1-weighted images. A threshold of 2.5 (based on manual inspection of the voxels with high PVS presence) was used to segment PVS, where a voxel with \"T1-weighted divided by T2weighted\" intensity of smaller than 2.5 was considered a voxel with high PVS presence (Figure   2 .a is a given example). An inflated mask of ventricle was then used to excluded incorrectly segmented voxels in the periventricular areas, mainly observed in the central and posterior horn of the ventricle. Four white matter regions were extracted from FreeSurfer's white matter segmentation outputs 59 , which was derived using Desikan-Killiany atlas 65 . When comparing diffusion MRI-derived measures, paired t-test and Pearson correlation was used."}, {"section_title": "ADNI-3 data and analysis", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease After downloading the raw images, dcm2nii was used to convert the dicom images to the nifti file format 68 . Diffusion MRI were corrected for eddy current distortion and for involuntary movement, using FSL TOPUP and EDDY tools 60, 61 . DTI, DTI-FWE, and TTI models were fit using the same procedure as with the HCP data. The data was analyzed using QIT to examine diffusion tensor parameters in deep white matter, as defined by the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) white matter atlas 69 . The JHU regions were segmented in each scan using an automated atlas-based approach described in Cabeen et al., 70 in which deformable tensor-based registration using DTI toolkit (DTI-TK) 71 was used to align the subject data to the Illinois institute of technology (IIT) diffusion tensor template 72 , and subsequently transform the JHU atlas regions to the subject data and compute the average of each diffusion tensor parameter with each JHU region.\nWe used linear regression when investigating the relation between diffusion-derived measures with the cognitive stage using an ordinary least square fitting routine, implemented with the statsmodels.OLS module in Python 3.5.3 (StatsModels version 0.8.0 -other Python packages that were used are Pandas version 0.20.3 and NumPy version 1.13.1). Multiple regressions were fitted to regional mean values, one region at a time. For every instance, sex, intracranial volume and age were included as covariates. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure with a false discovery rate of 0.1 was used to correct for multiple comparisons. Diffusion MRI-derived measures were compared using paired t-test and Pearson correlation. Bland-Altman plots 73 were used to investigate whether DTI and TTI were systematically different. Bland-Altman plot analysis are designed to investigate a bias between the mean differences 74 , where a distribution above or below the 0 (on the y-axis) indicates a bias."}, {"section_title": "Supplemental Figures", "text": "Supplemental Figure 1 .
