INTRODUCTION", "text": "The structure of American agriculture has changed extensively over the last several decades. Additional mechanization, increased labor productivity, and increased effectiveness of fertilizers and other chemicals, all the result of targeted research and development, have brought about large increases in partial productivity (e.g., yields) and total factor productivity. In the context of continued productivity gains, climate change and biotechnologies are among the most important features of modern US agriculture. Though both have been researched for decades, they have only recently become a focus of attention because of their potential to considerably impact food security, food safety, domestic energy supply, and global commodity trading. Because such widespread impacts (both positive and negative) may occur swiftly over large regions, with asymmetric effects and limited reversibility, both features merit further study. Estimating agricultural responses to short-run weather patterns (e.g., yields, total output, plantings, fertilizer use, crop insurance uptake) is not a new research program (Heady, 1952). However, the significance of evolving climate conditions for domestic and international agricultural markets renders it of crucial interest to consumers, producers, and policymakers. Warmer summers with more frequent and persistent heat waves, warmer autumns and winters, increased potential for -and duration of -droughts, and increased intensity of precipitation from storm systems are among the expected consequences of climate change in North America. If mitigation strategies have only limited or little success, adaptation will be necessary to minimize welfare loss. Unfortunately, there is currently sparse empirical evidence regarding the design and implementation of successful adaptation strategies (Nordhaus, 2013;Wagner and Weitzman, 2015). We can conjecture that agricultural technology firms may respond by improving drought-tolerant seeds or improving access to irrigation. Farmers may schedule plantings earlier in the spring, adjust acreage allocations and fertilizer timing, or switch to less water-intensive crops. Policymakers may codify additional adaptation guidelines or engineer new climate-related risk management tools. Given this limited evidence, major goals of this dissertation are to quantify the impacts of climate change on corn yields and productivity growth (Chapter 2) and identify possible farm-level adaptation strategies through crop-tillage choices and acreage allocations (Chapter 4). At the same time, recent developments in agricultural biotechnologies present new opportunities for increased productivity and food security, though especially food safety. Since the commercial introduction of Bt corn (using the soil bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis) in 1996, farmers have subsequently adopted more advanced varieties of genetically modified corn, soybeans, and cotton, resulting in current adoption rates of 70-90%. First generations of genetic modification technology were designed to help protect against insect and weed pests. Recent innovations have targeted more specific needs of growers, consumers, and other industry participants. For example, drought-tolerant corn seeds help reduce yield loss under extreme heat and drought conditions; low-oxidation apples stay fresher with less immediate browning after slicing; and new potato varieties reduce browning, bruising, and carcinogen-forming potential. Despite widespread adoption of biotechnologies from agricultural suppliers, acceptance among US consumers has not been universal. This is clearly seen, for example, in the contention surrounding public debate on mandatory labeling laws and strategies for successful coexistence of conventional and genetically modified crops. Many groups have an interest in the relative success (or failure) of biotechnologies, and information regarding the benefits (or harms) of biotech foods relative to conventional or organic foods reflect these groups' interests. As such, the other major goal of this dissertation is to quantify the combined effect of labeling and dispersed information on consumers' willingness-to-pay for new biotech potatoes and potato products that have been genetically engineered to reduce the potential for forming high concentrations of the probable human carcinogen, acrylamide (Chapter 3). The general relationship and feedback between climate change and biotechnologies, both at aggregate and disaggregate scales, also remain poorly understood. Only in the past few years have policymakers and researchers begun to consider biotechnologies as useful tools for helping to limit downside climate change risks. Even if the objectives of most genetic modification applications are not concerned with increasing resilience to worsening climate conditions, the indirect benefits associated with increased overall stress resistance have been large (Chapter 2). However, overuse of these technologies are beginning to impose problems on growing conditions, sometimes in ways exacerbated by climate change. As weeds become more resistant to herbicides, such as those used in genetically modified glyphosate-and glufosinate-tolerant seeds, producers may switch to other chemicals with different consequences for local environments. Equally as important, climate change may bring about favorable growing conditions for increased propagation of insects, weeds, and plant diseases. Thus, there are strong linkages between both features of modern US agriculture and will likely become increasingly interrelated over the next several decades. Apart from these straightforward economic linkages, there are three unifying themes weaving together this dissertation. First, recognition of underlying heterogeneity and small-scale variability is a key aspect of understanding and solving agricultural climate and biotechnology problems. Corn yields in dispersed areas of the US can have significantly different responses to climate change (Chapter 2), as well as farmers responding to climate conditions in their choices of field-level inputs (Chapter 4). Similarly, consumers can have highly variable reactions to information about biotechnologies (Chapter 3), which relates to the second unifying theme: asymmetric effects. In general, very negative information about biotechnologies reduces willingness-to-pay by a dollar amount greater than increases in willingness-to-pay from very positive information. This principle also emerges in county yield-climate relationships and farmers' crop choice. One to two degrees of warming in certain regions may have minimal effects on optimal field choices but could induce crop switching in regions that permit less effective adaptation to increased heat (Chapter 4). Third, climate change economics and information economics present inherently dynamic problems. To ensure greater accuracy, yield forecasts must be updated with the most recent climate and technology conditions (Chapter 2), and cropland must account for past rotations (Chapter 4). Similarly, consumer response to information treatments is tied to learning, a dynamic process that must be recognized in estimation."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 2. CLIMATE CHANGE, TECHNOLOGY, AND US CORN YIELDS 2.1 Introduction", "text": "Corn has been the most important crop in the United States throughout much of the twentieth century. In recent years, planted corn acreage has averaged 20% of US cropland, with total production value far in excess of other row crops (USDA, 2013). Its importance stems from its many uses as a raw and intermediate input, which links each year's crop to various markets. Substantial yield growth over the past half-century has bolstered domestic food security, increased biofuels feedstock supplies, provided greater quantities of livestock feed, and boosted international food security through larger exports. 1 Growth in yields is directly linked to corn supply increases, input price declines (or stabilization), and other general equilibrium effects. If yield growth slows or reverses, as could happen with severe climate change, there would be substantial impacts in domestic and international food and energy markets. Unmitigated climate change is expected to adversely impact agricultural production over the next century. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts global temperature increases of 0.3 -6.4 \u2022 C by 2100, with more frequent heat waves and heavy precipitation . Although these projected detriments vary considerably by growing region and crop, the US corn industry is at risk (Schlenker et al., 2006;Schlenker and Roberts, 2009;Roberts et al., 2013;Lobell et al., 2013). Relative to other US cash crops, corn requires substantial water inputs and is vulnerable to temperature extremes. Changes in the intensity, frequency, duration, and timing of precipitation, combined with distributional changes in temperature, could bring about deep changes in US corn production environments and practices. Our research tests two broad hypotheses with county-level US data: (i). corn yields will decline under climate change in the next two decades, and (ii). climate change damages adversely impact yield productivity growth. The former hypothesis is short-run in nature and considers immediate market impacts. The latter hypothesis considers longrun productivity, which is a currently missing prerequisite for longer-term forecasting. Policy recommendations differ crucially based on the validity (or lack thereof) of these hypotheses. For example, if forecasts indicate substantial short-run declines in yield growth (or levels), then this would justify immediate policies designed to thwart food insecurity. If future yield productivity growth is adversely impacted by climate change, or adaptation has been limited, then this may warrant changes to encourage agricultural technology research, development, and adoption. To test (i), time-series data are used to estimate and forecast from a Cobb-Douglas production function. Bayesian methods account for parameter instability, outliers, and obsolescence of older data. To test (ii), we fit damage functions to a cross section of climate change and yield productivity growth. Our research is novel for several important reasons. We find that yields will increase by 10%-40% over currently observed averages through 2031. Some counties exhibit decreasing yields and decreasing yield growth, but the Corn Belt and Great Lakes areas will remain the top-producing regions. We also find significant relationships between climate change and the direction of yield productivity growth, suggesting opportunities for agricultural adaptation. This is an important aspect missing from the literature and critical for evaluating and designing longer-term public-and private-sector responses to climate change. Our methodological contribution is estimation of a Bayesian dynamic regression model that handles outliers, structural change, and obsolete data in a rigorous and unified fashion. Our production function draws on important concepts in agronomy (e.g., linear genetic gain) and agricultural meteorology (e.g., rainfall intensity). The end result is a set of implications and policy-relevant insights using a novel production specification with a more appropriate estimation framework. The economics of agricultural production, like those of other natural resources, are characterized by a biological-based production function subject to weather uncertainty and biological risks. These sources of randomness, in combination with evolving technology, are captured in our short-run results. Signals (forecasts) of future yields influence agents' expectations, driving changes in equilibrium behavior within and across markets. To the extent that corn profitability will dwindle in some areas, production will be reallocated to more profitable locations and crops. Hence, our short-run results help inform regional shifts in production, further specialization within an area, and relocation of corn-based industries. Our long-run results provide an analytical context to the forecasts and indicate adaptation possibilities. If yield productivity growth has been influenced by climate change, what are the implications for long-run yields, adaptation, and policies? The balance of the paper is organized as follows. The next section surveys past research. Section 3 introduces the econometric models. The fourth section presents the regression specifications and climate change data. Results and discussion are offered in the fifth section. The final section concludes. Further discussion, summary statistics, and robustness checks are offered in Appendix A."}, {"section_title": "Related research", "text": "The current research builds on work in three subdisciplines: applied state space models, agricultural economics, and climate change economics. Our framework proceeds from Miranowski et al. (2011), who fit autoregressive (AR) and linear trend models to annual corn yields during 1960-2009 for US states contributing 1% or more to total 2009 production. Break testing procedures find multiple breaks in some states, and the sample is accordingly partitioned to develop short run and long run forecasts to year 2030. Long run forecasts from linear trends indicate growth of 1-2 bu/ac per year, whereas short run models forecast 3-4 bu/ac growth in recent years. Short run and long run AR forecasts are similar (since AR models are simple cases of linear regressions), though somewhat more optimistic. One major policy implication is that sustained yield growth will free up cropland for alternative uses, assuming the rate of productivity growth outpaces worldwide increases in demand, thus implying reductions in GHG emissions attributable to corn production. Agronomists have been researching the relationship between corn yields and weather for the past half-century. Thompson (1962) is an early study focusing on yields in Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, and Ohio. July rainfall and August temperature are the most important variables across the five-state region. However, there has been more recent emphasis by agricultural economists on corn yields and climate change. Using Illinois field-level data, Dixon et al. (1994) show that models with solar radiation and growthstage variables can have better performance than conventional specifications. Since the mid-2000s, the agricultural economics literature has witnessed an increase in empirical studies attempting to pinpoint the prime determinants of crop yields. These studies differ with respect to choice of regressors, breadth of crops, spatial aggregation, and structural change. Schlenker and Roberts (2009) fit eighth-order polynomials to county-level yield data on corn, soybeans, and cotton for 1950-2005 while controlling for weather. The main result for corn yields is threefold: (i). increasing temperatures are beneficial up to 29 \u2022 C, (ii). yields are forecasted to decline by 20-30% for 2020-2049, and (iii). there has been limited historical adaptation of agriculture to warmer temperatures. Additional research finds other determinants with nonlinear and asymmetric yield impacts (Roberts et al., 2013). Tannura et al. (2008) regress annual soybean and corn yields for Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana on monthly temperature and rainfall variables (in the growing season) in a similar time period. Standard tests for heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation in errors, parameter instability, and model misspecification are implemented, all with varying results. June and July precipitation, July and August temperature, and a linear time trend are their most significant predictors. Xu et al. (2013) examine technological progress for county-level corn and soybean yields by using data on statewide adoption of GM seeds. Among their findings are that early season moisture has significant negative impacts, while GM trait adoption has strong positive impacts. Corn yields will increase at most by 31.8% over 2011-2030. Other corresponding works are Ortiz-Bobea (2013), Ortiz-Bobea and Just (2013), and Lobell et al. (2013), which consider nonlinear influences of temperature and precipitation. The latter considers the impacts of extreme heat and seasonal rainfall within a cropping systems simulation model. An analysis of climate change adaptation is taken up in Burke and Emerick (2013). The authors use panel data on growing degree day and precipitation bins for counties east of the 100 th meridian to explain 31-year long differences  of corn and soybean yields. Based on the percentage change in long difference estimates over panel fixed effects estimates, there is only meager evidence of adaptation. Average yields are forecasted to decline 15% by 2050 under the median climate model. Our long-run analysis implements a similar methodology but uses a 52-year long difference to explain latent yield productivity growth. A paper with similar methodology and production focus is Jin and Jorgenson (2010). Using data on 35 US industry sectors in 1960-2005, the Kalman filter is fitted to dynamic factor shares from a translog price function. In their state-space model of producer behavior, changes in the latent state variables reflect rates and biases of technical change. They find that the rate of autonomous technical change in agriculture over this period has been 0.55, with biases towards capital and energy and biases away from labor and materials. The rate of agriculture's autonomous technical change is forecasted to be 0.3 during 2006-2030.\nThe analyze fuel switching and energy demand (Mansur et al., 2008;Newell and Pizer, 2008;Hanemann et al., 2013). This line of research adapts earlier work on selection and models that relate first-and second-step choices via correlations in disturbances (Heckman, 1979;Lee, 1983;Dubin and McFadden, 1984). For example, Mansur et al. (2008) explain fuel choice for residential and commercial buildings using firm information, building characteristics, demographics, and climate data. They find that climate change will likely boost electricity use for cooling and reduce other fuels for heating. In a similar study, Seo and Mendelsohn (2008) use data on 949 farmers in South America (Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Argentina, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Columbia) to estimate a multinomial logit model of crop choice. Although the intensive margin (land allocation) is not estimated, they find that farmers will switch from wheat, potatoes, and corn to squash, vegetables, and fruit through year 2100. In a related discrete-continuous study, Seo 2010 Finally, our research extends the literature on the use of the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) data. This is a complex stratified dataset that has been little employed in environmental economics. ARMS data have been much more widely used in applied agricultural economic analyses. Such studies can provide insight into methodologies, model selection, and data differences over survey years (Goodwin and Mishra, 2005;Kirwan, 2009;Mayen et al., 2010;Gillespie et al., 2010). There are known limitations with the data, most notably that it does not contain farm-level panels. Analysts must be careful to take these limitations into consideration (National Research Council, 2008)."}, {"section_title": "Econometric model", "text": "We assume that the yield production function takes the Cobb-Douglas form. The Cobb-Douglas production function is less general than other traditional flexible forms but economizes on estimated parameters and has a more straightforward interpretation. For county i in period t, yields (y it ) are: where X ijt is the j th production input, \u03b1 ijt is the associated partial output elasticity, and A it summarizes the level of technology. Log-linearizing (2.1) and appending an econometric disturbance gives the Cobb-Douglas regression equation: log(y it ) = log(A it ) + j \u03b1 ijt log(X ijt ) + it . (2.2) Note that the productivity term, log(A it ), is captured in the intercept of the regression. Gradual movement in the regression intercept over time is broadly indicative of technical change, which we term as yield productivity growth. 2 Our dynamic model permits estimation of year-to-year changes in productivity, a key advantage over static approaches. Although the specification in (2.2) does not address induced, biased technical change in US agriculture, it is natural to use a parsimonious model in the context of highly uncertain climate change. 3 Underlying our model of production is the idea that short-run yield fluctuations in a given area are driven mainly by random weather variation and adopted technologies. The biological connections between corn plant growth and weather (e.g., rainfall, solar radiation, and humidity) are well-documented in agronomy. This biological basis motivates (2.1), and sufficient variability ensures identification of (2.2). Adoption of agricultural technologies in a given year also has a direct effect on yields. To properly analyze climate impacts on production, the role and level of technology must be considered, though this is frequently missing in reduced-form models. Over the latter half of the twentieth-century, yields have risen because of improvements in machinery and management systems, the early diffusion of hybrids and later innovation of genetically-modified varieties, decreases in row spacing accommodated in part by improved pesticides, gains in nitrogen use efficiency, and so on. The joint role of technology and weather in shaping yields is thus explicit in our model. 4 2 There is a large empirical literature on total factor productivity (TFP) in agriculture. Capital, labor, land, and other inputs are typically used to calculate regional productivity indices (Ball et al., 2001). As our focus is on weather and climate impacts and their relation to long-run productivity differences, productivity indices do not need to be calculated. 3 We assume that the composition of farms in each county is not affected by climate change. If climate change influences, for example, farm size or farm labor supply, then this would have indirect effects on county yields. There is little evidence that these indirect effects are large or economically meaningful. 4 Input endogeneity and the choice of which technologies to include are concerns in the empirical production literature. By restricting our sample to rainfed regions, irrigation and climate-induced reductions in water supply are safely omitted. The other major variable input is nitrogen. Using USGS nitrogen data for 540 Corn Belt counties in 1987-2006, we find that fixed effects panel estimates of One important aspect missing from (2.2) and short-run studies using time-series variation is biotechnology adaptation. As climate change deepens, technology firms have responded by introducing farm-level adaptation measures, such as drought-tolerant seeds and climate-based management guidelines. This suggests that long run yield productivity growth is endogenous to climate (Dell et al., 2012). One policy-relevant interpretation of this hypothesis is that expected damages from climate change influence yield productivity growth:  (Tol, 2009;Nordhaus, 2013). We propose a more direct approach by using the dynamic results in (2.2) to estimate (2.3) from a cross-sectional long difference. Understanding how yield productivity growth responds to climate is a crucial input into informed policymaking. Equations (2.2) and (2.3) are the empirical equations of interest and are used to examine the short-run and long-run claims. The Bayesian model used to estimate the dynamics of (2.2) is introduced below, and econometric considerations are given in the following subsection. We then discuss estimation of adaptation equation (23).\nThe nature of the experiment (repeated measurement of valuations), breadth and depth of questionnaires, and sample of 304 subjects provides latitude for empirical methods. Regression analysis of WTP levels, however, is problematic for two reasons. First, some zero bids are truncated at zero, i.e., subjects would have preferred to bid a negative value but felt constrained to bid zero instead. Other zero bids are legitimate bids with no truncation, i.e., zero was the preferred bid (Maddala, 1983). Second, valuation levels, although sincere, may be arbitrary (Ariely et al., 2003). 17 Our approach uses WTP differences across subjects for parameter estimation. Another benefit of this method is that unobserved heterogeneity (e.g., subject fixed effects) are differenced out in the estimation. We propose the following model of WTP differences: In the above equations, x i is a vector of demographics and other controls for person i, T i are indicator variables for information treatments, and \u03b5 .,i is a random error. Further, is the difference in WTP for biotech potatoes before and after the information treatments, while is the difference in WTP for biotech potatoes and conventional potatoes before and after the information treatments. The latter is designed to examine information impacts in transitioning from conventional potatoes to low-acrylamide biotech potatoes. 18 This is of practical significance given recent USDA deregulation. Note that estimates of the \u03b3 . parameters indicate treatment effects. When there is truncation at zero for a WTP value, the WTP difference in equation 1 we observe a zero value for WTP, we do not know whether it is a legitimate zero or a \"constrained\" zero. This estimation procedure is inefficient if WTP among potato products is jointly determined. Since subjects are informed at the beginning of the experiments that they will be bidding on potatoes, French fries, and potato chips, this could condition subjects to think about their WTP simultaneously. We could impose cross-equation correlation of disturbances and fit a Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) model (Zellner, 1962). However, the auction commodities differ greatly with respect to preparation times, convenience, and storage, so it is likely that valuations are formed independently."}, {"section_title": "Dynamic linear model", "text": "In linear state space models, data at any time period are a linear, additive function of unobserved states and a random disturbance. Unobserved states evolve according to weather are unaffected when nitrogen is included, instrumented, or excluded. For example, the weather elasticities for monthly average temperature and precipitation differ by at most 0.07 across the three models. Instrumental variables are soybean acreage in previous years and ammonia exports per mile from New Orleans, the major US import center. a random walk. Our model is the following: At any time t, Y t is the dependent variable, F t is a (1 \u00d7 n) vector of regressors, \u03b8 t is an (n \u00d7 1) vector of regression coefficients (state parameters), G t is the system evolution matrix, \u03bd t is the observation disturbance, and \u03c9 t is the system disturbance vector. In the above framework, (2.4) is the observation or data equation, and (2.5) denotes the system or state evolution equation. Error terms satisfy temporal and mutual independence, i.e., Cov(\u03bd s , \u03bd t ) = 0, Cov(\u03c9 s , \u03c9 t ) = 0 nxn for all t = s and Cov(\u03bd t , \u03c9 t ) = 0 n for all t, s. The observation variance is the product of a known variance dispersion parameter, k t , and \u03c6 t , the observation's precision, which is given a gamma prior distribution. The system shock follows a mean-zero, multivariate t-distribution with degrees of freedom that are updated sequentially and a block-diagonal variance (scale matrix), W t . The three submatrices comprising W t are an intercept block, a regression block, and a time trend block. Since various pieces of explanatory information can decay at different rates, each of the blocks is adjusted by a distinct discount factor: \u03b4 int , \u03b4 R , and \u03b4 tr . We assume the following priors on coefficients and the observation variance: where a t and R t are the location and scale parameters of the multivariate t-distribution with \u03b4 t n t\u22121 degrees of freedom. Correspondingly, (\u03b4 t n t\u22121 /2, \u03b4 t d t\u22121 /2) are the shape and scale parameters of the gamma distribution. All knowledge available at time t \u2212 1 is contained in the information set, I t\u22121 . The discount factor appearing here is an \"overall model\" discount. This discount should be very close to unity since \u03b4 int , \u03b4 R , and \u03b4 tr already account for gradual information loss as data become obsolete. Conjugacy implies that posterior and one-step ahead forecast distributions are: (2.10) Although the observation depends linearly on the regression coefficients, the set of updating equations shows that several nonlinearities affect posterior distribution shapes. The k-step ahead forecast distributions are given by: in which the locations and scales are computed from a smaller set of equations. In out-ofsample forecasting, the state prior means are always equal to the state posterior means at the last available date in the sample. Similarly, the state prior variance (scale) is initially equated to the last available state posterior variance but then evolves with changes in W t+k . For more details, readers are referred to Pole et al. (1994) and West and Harrison (1997)."}, {"section_title": "Econometric considerations", "text": "The dynamic linear regression model exhibits many desirable features. First, structural change is implemented \"naturally\" via time-varying parameters. Rather than splitting the data into subsamples, the filter uses available information to derive estimates that fluctuate over time. Since there is evidence of multiple breaks over the past 50 years, the potential for future structural change must be taken seriously, i.e., explicit modeling of the break process (Elliott and Timmermann, 2008). Second, DLMs improve on less descriptive ARIMA models by assimilating useful information from regressors. Third, this model accounts for climate-change induced weather variability in out-of-sample forecasts. A few statistical issues require further clarification. From (2.5), the parameters follow a random walk. Random walks do not satisfy covariance stationarity because their variances depend on time (Enders, 2009). Thus, the model is nonstationary, which is more useful for applied research than restrictive stationary models. 5 One may also be concerned about efficiency losses and forecasting inaccuracy from a dynamic model if the true process is static. If the coefficients are mean-reverting, then a static linear estimator (like OLS) does not produce severely biased results (Elliott and Timmermann, 2008). Simulations from Ciapanna and Taboga (2011) suggest that DLMs fare well under several scenarios, including those in which the data are generated from a constant process, contain a small number of breaks, or contain frequent breaks. 6 Most dynamic models are not scale invariant, i.e., rescaling regressors without adjusting priors can result in altered posteriors (Ciapanna and Taboga, 2011). This is remedied by standardizing regressors, which ensures commensurability of regressors and gives a correct interpretation of the time-varying intercept (West and Harrison, 1997;Pole et al., 1994). Discount factors also require attention. Discounts lie in [0, 1], with larger values indicating less information decay and downweighting of older data. One automatic practice chooses discounts to maximize the loglikelihood, but this can result in estimation from the most recent three or four observations, such as for \u03b4 < 0.7 (Pole et al., 1994). To avoid this problem, we set all discounts in [0.90, 0.99]."}, {"section_title": "Damage function estimation", "text": "A fundamental understanding of long-run connections between climate and technology is crucial for assessing short-run forecasts and developing more realistic economic analyses of damages and mitigation opportunities. Investigating the relationship in (2.3) requires a choice of functional form for climate damages. Climate economics theory offers several forms, including linear, quadratic, exponential, and others, depending on beliefs about uncertainty, thresholds, and nonlinearities. Among the most widely-accepted is the inverse-quadratic in temperature change used by the Dynamic Integrated Model of Climate and the Economy (Nordhaus, 2013). In the DICE model, percentage changes in gross domestic product depend on the level of temperature change and its square. We modify this intuition and generalize the inverse-quadratic to estimate the following: For the i th county, log(A i,2011 ) \u2212 log(A i,1960 ) measures yield productivity growth. It is the difference in 1960 and 2011 estimated intercepts from the Bayesian DLM, i.e., \u03b8 i,2011 \u2212\u03b8 i,1960 intercepts in (2.5). The \u2206x i are climate variables, z i are soil productivity controls, and \u03b5 i is an i.i.d. normal disturbance. Nonlinear least squares (NLS) is used for estimation. The two important features of (2.13) are that: (i). identification comes from cross-sectional variation in exogenous inputs, and (ii). climate change is operationalized as a long difference (half century) of weather variables. These provide a long-run interpretation of the association between yield productivity growth and climate change, inclusive of adaptation. To ensure that our results do not hinge on functional form assumptions, we also estimate the exponential damage function of Weitzman (2009), as well as a direct linear model. See Tables A.4 and A.5 of Appendix A for the coefficients."}, {"section_title": "Regression specifications and data", "text": "The following subsections detail the econometric specifications needed to examine our two claims. As with any applied econometric study, the true model is unknown. Appendix A contains a number of robustness checks with respect to model specification. See text in this appendix for comparisons involving: a linear trend only (Fig A.3), temperature- , two-inch intense precipitation (Fig A.8), average and extreme growing degree days (Fig A.9), sample length (Fig A.10-A.13), climate model , and panel fixed effects estimation )."}, {"section_title": "Baseline DLM specification", "text": "Evidence from agricultural economics, agronomy, and plant biology point to a basic regression model that uses temperature and precipitation variables during important periods of the growing season to explain yields. At a physiological level, water uptake by corn plants occurs via the development of their root structure that absorbs soil moisture. Development of the plant also requires photosynthesis, the biological process by which light is converted into chemical compounds used for energy. To show how temperature and precipitation explain county-level yields, a complete dataset would include plant-level measurements of water uptake, photosynthesis rates, solar radiation, air temperature, technology, and so on. Such detailed records are not available, and few available datasets permit consistent spatial aggregation or application to commercial agriculture. 7 To proxy physiological effects during peak periods of crop development, we use countywide means of precipitation and temperature for the months of May, June, July, and August. Our sample comprises 770 rainfed counties with a complete data record for 1960-2011 from states producing at least 1% of US production in 2009-2011. Weather data are from two sources. The first is the PRISM AN81m dataset of gridded (4 km x 4 km) monthly temperatures and precipitation (PRISM Climate Group, 2004). The second is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) CPC Unified Gauge-Based Analysis of Daily Precipitation (NOAA, 2008). These are daily precipitation data interpolated at 0.25 \u2022 latitude x 0.25 \u2022 longitude grids. For both sources, we aggregate to the county level based on area-weighted or grid-weighted averages. A linear time trend is used to detrend the yield data. This important modeling choice is motivated directly from the agronomy literature. Corn breeders have consistently found linear genetic gain in twentieth-century yields (Duvick, 1984;Crosbie et al., 2006;Smith et al., 2014). Yield models without linear trends (or linearly detrended yields) are in distinct contradiction to the weight of empirical agronomic evidence and are misspecified. The trend is also a suitable proxy for gradually increasing-inputs, such as nitrogen fertilizer use for many years in our sample. We also use the linear trend for near-term forecasting because it reflects improvements in technology from past and current research investments. Modern breeding is a scientifically-advanced, multi-billion dollar industry with research pipelines generally spanning seven years (or longer) from field trials to commercialization (Crosbie et al., 2006;Smith et al., 2014). Omission of the trend for forecasting purposes is equivalent to disregarding useful institutional and economic details and would result in misspecification. 8 Figure A.3 in Appendix A depicts 2031 yield forecasts with an intercept-and trend-only model. For the i th county in period t, the baseline set of regressors is: Besides damage caused by droughts and inundations, durations of high rainfall rates contribute to lower yields by leaching some plant nutrients in soils. Rainfall runoff and erosion carry away nutrients on and bound to the soil surface and limit the effectiveness of fertilizers. Precipitation intensity (or lack thereof) is measured as the proportion of days in a month (May, June, July, or August) not receiving at least one inch of rain per day. To our knowledge, there are few sources in the climate change literature that provide forecasts of extreme rainfall events . Therefore, we implement a negative binomial regression on time to generate rainfall intensity forecasts for use in the regressions over the forecasting period. 10 Adding an intercept term and linear time trend, the alternative specification for the i th county in period t is: where IntP rec i,t indicates separate measures of intense precipitation for the months of May, June, July, and August. Figure A.8 depicts forecasts using two-inch daily intense precipitation regressors."}, {"section_title": "Climate change scenarios", "text": "Given the growing weight of evidence ascribing current weather conditions to global warming (Section 2), it is unlikely that future climate circumstances will be adequately depicted by trends prevailing in 1960-2011. Therefore, it is inappropriate to follow a standard forecasting practice of evaluating the estimated regression model at the sample means of the independent variables. A common practice in applied environmental research is to assimilate output from multiple realizations (runs) of one or more global climate models (GCMs). Although there are drawbacks (e.g., stringent GCM assumptions and conflicting GCM results), this approach is the most plausible for our forecasts (Auffhammer et al., 2013). Data on precipitation and minimum and maximum daily temperatures for the next two decades (2012-2031) are from NASA's NEX-DCP30 project (Thrasher et al., 2013). These are climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) that NASA has downscaled to the 800m x 800m grid cell with adjustments for mismatches between simulations and the historical record. These data are categorized according to four levels of climate change. 11 Results in the analysis only consider mild climate change, i.e., RCP 2.6. This is because estimates and forecasts under severe climate change, RCP 8.5, are very similar to the RCP 2.6 results in our prior state-level analysis. This is consistent with projections that significant departures from current weather patterns (precipitation, temperature, drought, and flooding, etc.) are not expected over the next two decades. To ensure that the forecasts are not inordinately influenced by a few GCMs or specific runs within a GCM, future climate regressors are averaged over four models: CCSM4, GFDL-CM3, MIROC5, and HadGEM2-AO. Our choice of models is guided by Pierce et al. (2009), which presents a list of top models according to a \"skill score.\" These models, or similar models from the same climate institutions, have also been used in the climate economics literature.  in Appendix A depict forecasts for each of the models separately."}, {"section_title": "Damage function specification", "text": "Climate change variables in the damage function rely on data from the baseline and alternative models. We fit two specifications of (2.13). The first specification is the conventional inverse-quadratic damage function. Climate change variables in this specification are: , \u2206AugustT emp i , and (\u2206AugustT emp i ) 2 . Rather than subtracting 1960 from 2011 weather data, we subtract five-year averages at both endpoints (1960-1964 and 2007-2011). This reduces the influence of unusually poor or beneficial weather in 1960 or 2011 in the estimates. The second damage function specification uses: \u2206July85 i , \u2206August85 i , \u2206M ayIntP rec i , \u2206JuneIntP rec i , \u2206JulyIntP rec i , and \u2206AugustIntP rec i . There is less support for quadratic terms in this specification as the variables already consider climate change extremes. Soil productivity significantly contributes to growth of the corn plant, with important effects on yields. There is general consensus that soil productivity is time-invariant, so its influence on yields would difference out of the long-run econometric model. However, since the long-run analysis uses cross-sectional variation, we follow the convention in the literature and include soil controls. Table A.3 in Appendix A illustrates that our results are robust to excluding soil variables. The Soil Survey Geographic database (SSURGO) contains data collected by the National Cooperative Soil Survey over the past century (USDA-NRCS, 2013). There are several dozen measures of physical and chemical soil properties that affect soil productivity, and more research is needed to identify the most important soil determinants. We use five soils variables that are well-known and have complete records in all counties: slope gradient, T value, root zone available water storage, National Commodity Crop Productivity Index -Corn and Soybeans (NCCPI-CS), and an erosion indicator. Slope gradient is the elevation difference between two points divided by the distance be-tween the two points. The T value captures maximum sustainable soil erosion. Root zone available water storage is the average volume of available water that can be stored in the plant's root zone. The NCCPI-CS combines several soil properties conducive to growing corn and soybeans. The erosion indicator is the county-level percentage of soils visually identified as eroded. Soil productivity is not a main focus but is an important factor in explaining yields and growth under climate change."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Descriptive statistics for most of the data used in the analysis are in Table 2.1. Summary statistics for weather data are not decomposed into within-and between-variation (N = 770 counties x 52 years). Across the sample, corn yields range from 9 to 207 bu/ac, with a mean of 103 bu/ac. The hottest month is July, averaging 23 \u2022 C with roughly 10 cm of precipitation. Intense precipitation events are infrequent: on average, just under one day each month in the growing season experiences at least one inch of precipitation. Weather patterns in 2012-2031 are similar to those in sample. Average temperatures rise 1.5-2.0 \u2022 C and August rainfall drops by nearly one cm. Although on the upper end of near-term climate change, these differences are within the range of other major climate model predictions. The soil controls show that our sample has diverse innate land productivity characteristics. Eroded land within a county ranges from zero to 83 percent, and available water storage at the root zone exhibits substantial variability, despite being restricted to rainfed regions. The average NCCPI of 0.53, with a range of [0.02, 0.90], indicates good overall suitability for growing soybeans and corn. The NCCPI is constructed from many soil properties, including organic matter content, pH, soil depth, and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Dobos et al., 2012). It does not incorporate corn yield data, so spurious correlation in results is not a concern. Using a crop productivity index, such as the NCCPI, is a more parsimonious alternative to including many other soil variables. Sample counties and their 2011 corn yields are depicted in Figure 2.1. Top-yielding counties are located in Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, eastern Nebraska, and western Indiana and Ohio. 12 These highly productive areas are predominantly in the Corn Belt, where yields have been the highest over the past half-century. Missouri, Pennsylvania, Kansas, western South Dakota, and eastern North Dakota have lower yields in 2011 and in prior decades. The distribution of yields in Figure 2.1 largely reflect spatial differences in climate, soil productivity, and technology adoption. For instance, central Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota have less productive soils than the Corn Belt, but similar weather patterns, technology adoption, and management practices have kept yields high. The substantial interactions between weather and technology will continue to drive yield growth over the coming decades. Section A of Appendix A further characterizes the data. Table A.1 provides summary statistics on the averaged long difference data used for the long-run analysis. The direction and magnitude of climate change are consistent with intuition and related studies. Differences in average and intense precipitation in some counties help explain differences between the baseline and alternative forecasts. To further explore the role of productivity growth, we consider estimates of the dy- For the baseline specification, Nebraska counties tend to have high productivity in early years. The 1960 intercepts are consistent with yields of 50-60 bu/ac, which match observed yields in these counties. Assuming average weather conditions, variability among counties reflects differences in soil productivity, management practices, fertilizer applica-tions, and other production dimensions in the county intercept. At the sample endpoint, the intercepts indicate yields in [90,125]   . These states also have different patterns of crop production and management practices over time. Given these differences, yields are forecasted to increase less than one bu/ac through Since these estimates are generated from the short-run regressions, standard errors must be adjusted (Dumont et al., 2005). We follow the empirical literature and bootstrap the standard errors with the number of bootstrap replications equal to the sample size. The bootstrapped standard errors are clustered by crop reporting district (CRD) to account for spatial correlations in climate conditions and soil productivity over small areas. 20 Although all regressors vary at the county level, spatial correlations among regressors at higher levels of aggregation (e.g., CRDs) could contribute to underestimation of standard errors (Kloek, 1981;Moulton, 1986). The differenced dependent variable helps alleviate misspecification bias by eliminating time-invariant factors that could confound a given year's intercept. For the baseline model evaluated at the sample mean, we find that 1 \u2022 C increases in May and June temperatures have reduced productivity growth by 2.4 and 1.0 percentage points. A similar 1 \u2022 C increase in July temperature has increased productivity growth by roughly 1.0 percentage points. This suggests that, in long-run equilibrium, (Hicks-neutral) technology has adapted to a changing climate. We do not explore specific 19 The climate change economics literature finds coefficients with small magnitudes. Using a variety of small starting values, the nonlinear least squares routine converges quickly. 20 Crop reporting districts are USDA-defined groups of contiguous counties within states that have similar agricultural production characteristics. Many states contain nine CRDs, and there is a total of 105 CRDs in our 14-state sample. adaptation mechanisms, but there may be several reasons why small changes in temperatures improve yield productivity growth. For example, improvements in technology may capture benefits from minor increases in growing degree days and CO 2 fertilization effects. The estimates indicate small but significant climate effects on yield productivity growth, with 46 percent of variation explained by climate and soil controls. The second column of Table 2.2 reports estimates from the alternative DLM. This is a useful robustness check of the first column results. Since the dependent variable is the result of regressions involving extreme climate variables, it is less likely to be correlated with average climate variables. This reduces the potential for spurious significance. Evaluated at the sample mean, we find that a 1 \u2022 C increase in May temperature reduces productivity growth by 5.5 percentage points, while a 1 \u2022 C increase in June temperature increases productivity growth by 5.4 percentage points. The sign switch of the marginal effect of June temperatures from baseline (-1.0 percentage point) to alternative (5.4 percentage points) is driven by the sign switch in the linear June temperature term (-0.007). The reduction in fit, R 2 = 0.14, implies that the alternative DLM explains productivity growth less adequately. The last two columns of Table 2.2 list estimates for the second damage function specification. Coefficient estimates closely approximate marginal effects since there are no quadratic terms. An additional 10 years in which July maximum temperatures exceed 85 \u2022 F decrease productivity growth by 10.7 percentage points. Intense precipitation has a similar but smaller influence. A one percentage point increase in the proportion of days in May or August not receiving at least one inch of rain increases productivity growth by about 0.5% and 0.3%. Finally, the R 2 of 0.36 indicates that climate extremes are useful for explaining productivity growth from production functions using average weather. Turning to the alternative model in the last column, we find that R 2 decreases to 0.15, similar to the R 2 from our other model using the alternative DLM intercepts (second column). Yield productivity growth from a model of production based on weather extremes is more difficult to explain in the long run. Given the increasing variability (or occurrence) of weather extremes, this result is not surprising. Identifying the impacts of infrequent but damaging climate events continues to be a challenge in the empirical literature. The damaging impacts of intense precipitation, though, are robust to the choice of dependent variable. A one percentage point increase in the fraction of days in May and August not experiencing an inch or more of rain increases productivity growth by 0.9% and 0.8%. The soil productivity variables are generally significant at the 5% and 1% levels and have the expected signs. Counties with steeper slopes and higher percentages of eroded soils have seen smaller productivity gains. Root zone available water storage has a small but positive effect. The links between soils, climate, and productivity growth are less definitive. Landowners may be able to alter some soil characteristics over time in response to changing climate such as organic matter content, drainage, erosion potential, and compaction through improved land management such as cover crops. Other innovative land management practices such as drainage management, bioreactors, and no-till production (see Chapter 4) may help maintain soil health and moisture."}, {"section_title": "Implications", "text": "Why has there been a significant link between yield productivity growth and climate change in the twentieth century? Conventional breeding has not directly targeted phenotypic changes that can better handle climate change. Rather, there have been sequences of new varieties with increased overall stress resistance (Duvick, 1984;Crosbie et al., 2006;Smith et al., 2014). Morphological changes in root and stalk lodging, barrenness, tassel size, leaf angle, and staygreen as a result of breeding have decreased susceptibility to moderate climate change. For example, hardier root systems permit more effective water and nutrient uptake especially during dry conditions; increased staygreen may extend beneficial photosynthesis during periods of greater solar radiation; and insects may be more vulnerable to Bt traits under variable weather conditions. Our results are also consistent with increased drought tolerance for corn and soybeans prior to initiatives to develop drought-tolerant seeds (Yu and Babcock, 2010). This suggests that advances in new varieties, combined with improved crop management practices, will aid agricultural adjustment to less advantageous weather. Improvements in farm machinery, irrigation, and other capital equipment have brought about labor-saving technical change. The advent of personal computers, the internet, and other information technologies has aided crop management through monitoring, variable application rates, and more precise practices. Extensive genetic modification has boosted yields and created substitution opportunities away from labor, capital, and pesticides (Fernandez-Cornejo et al., 2014;Huffman, 2014). Representing technical change as augmenting a single factor or small set of factors is therefore too simplistic. Our assumption of disembodied, unbiased technical change is also simplistic but provides tractability in production settings that evolve rapidly over time. Evidence against induced innovation in agriculture supports our decision to omit factor prices in the production function estimation (Liu and Shumway, 2009). The release of drought-tolerant varieties, ongoing development of resistance to salinity and frost, and onset of private firms offering climate-based information technologies and risk management ensure that yield productivity growth in the near future will be multifaceted (McFadden and Miranowski, 2015). Our emphasis on total factor productivity, rather than multifactor productivity or biased technical change, is thus conservative. The short-run forecasts to 2031 will differ from realized yields, but our evidence that yield productivity growth has responded (adapted) to long-run climate is robust and likely to hold in coming years. Inference from both the short-run and long-run claims show that yields remain sensitive to extreme heat and precipitation rates, but damages can be partially mitigated through targeted research and development (R&D). Improvements in drought-tolerant seeds will play a larger role in helping farmers adapt to persistently hot and dry conditions. Our results are the first to point out that increasingly intense rainfall events will have generally damaging effects on yields. There is also a role for improved management technologies (e.g., cover crops and no-till production) to improve soil health and help reduce climate-induced nutrient and soil losses."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Climate change poses serious risks to national and global agriculture, food, and feedstock security. Policymakers, consumers, and firms will increasingly consider assessments of climate change impacts to assist decision making. The research tests two general hypotheses, one related to short-run impacts and the other concerning long-run impacts: (i). relative to 2011 yields, corn yields will decline under climate change during 2012-2031, and (ii). climate change damages have had adverse historical effects on yield productivity growth. Using data on 770 non-irrigated counties, the econometric evidence rejects both hypotheses. Under mild (or moderate) climate change, 2031 yields will increase by 10%-40% over 2011 yields, though there are a few outlier counties with greater increases (and possibly decreases) in yields. Assuming 2012 harvested acreage, 2031 corn production under the baseline model in these 770 counties is 12.8 bil bushels, 19% larger than 2012 total US production of 10.8 bil bushels. The evolution of yield productivity growth is addressed by the long-run estimates. Average climate change has had small but significant influences on yield productivity growth. Growth through 2031 is reduced when accounting for weather extremes, particularly early-and late-season intense precipitation. Our estimates of yield productivity growth compare favorably to related studies. Of particular interest is comparability of our estimates with those of the agriculture sector in Jin and Jorgenson (2010). Using similar techniques, we find that Hicks-neutral yield productivity growth has been 0.48, similar to their rate of autonomous technical change in agriculture of roughly 0.55. Our average forecasted growth of 10%-40% is also consistent with their 0.3 rate of autonomous technical change forecasted for 2006-2030. Dell et al. (2012) find that a 1 \u2022 C temperature increase in poor countries reduces economic growth by an average of 1.3 percentage points in a given year. This is a much larger annual effect compared to our findings over the 1960-2011 horizon. However, there is general agreement that climate change can impact growth rates, implying long-run economic consequences in several industries. Thus, our results and forecasts add to (and compare favorably with) a growing literature considering links between climate and technical change. In the absence of market frictions, crop production should shift to regions of highest comparative advantage. Our baseline results indicate that Corn Belt counties will continue to grow the majority of the nation's corn supply over the next two decades, despite increasing climate risk. Yields in Great Lakes counties will increase somewhat more than those of Plains counties. Over the next 30-50 years, higher-latitude regions will become warmer and experience more variable rainfall and temperatures, but yield productivity growth is expected to partially offset these negative effects. Even with adverse weather, farmers will continue to maximize expected net returns (see chapter 4). Under moderate climate change, this will entail optimal adjustments along the intensive and extensive margins. For example, farmers will alter planting times and the timing and volume of chemical and nutrient applications. Rainfed farms in frequently drought-stressed regions will adopt drought-tolerant seeds, consistent with the economics of technology adoption (Griliches, 1957;Zilberman et al., 2012). Over the longer term, farmers will begin to plant crops that are more suited to the altered environment (Olmstead and Rhode, 2011;. Kloek T. 1981          The first two columns give results for the conventional damage function, while the last two columns are results for the second damage function. \"Baseline\" refers to technical change for the baseline model's coefficients. \"Alternative\" refers to technical change for the alternative model's coefficients.

This has been a concern of the US potato industry in recent years. Proposition 65 in the State of California requires a public notice to be displayed at businesses selling foods with acrylamide. Thus, US potato consumers and producers have a joint interest in the introduction of potato products with decreased acrylamide concentrations. Using experimental methods, we test the combined effects of labeling and information on WTP differences for conventional potato products and potato products using biotechnology to reduce acrylamide. Experiments took place in the Des Moines, Los Angeles, and Boston areas, with a combined sample of 304 subjects and 300 useable observations. Random n th -price auctions elicit WTP before and after each subject receives (reads) a randomly assigned information treatment. Each information treatment contains one or two perspectives: (i). industry perspective, (ii). scientific perspective, and (iii). \"environmental group\" perspective. We find that the various information treatments have differing, but sizeable, effects on WTP differences. These differences increase by $0.43-$1.95 for positive information perspectives relative to the \"environmental group\" perspective. The scientific perspective is the most influential single perspective, but treatments that combine the scientific perspective and industry perspective have the largest effect on WTP differences. Generally, information effects are additive, e.g., the effect of combining industry and scientific information equals the sum of the separate effects. Treatments that combine the \"environmental group\" perspective with either the industry perspective or scientific perspective have lower effects on WTP differences than treatments containing the industry-only or scientific-only perspective. However, there are insignificant sequencing effects of information perspectives within a treatment. Prior knowledge of biotech and non-biotech food products, health and exercise, and a few demographic variables have substantial impacts. Comparing our results with those of other food valuation studies using experimental auctions is less straightforward. Our experiment elicits WTP before and after subjects receive information treatments for conventional food products and those that have been genetically modified to reduce a plausible cancer concern. As such, our study incorporates a unique combination of information treatments, labels, and repeated measurement of WTP within a GM food safety context. However, we confirm several of the results in Huffman et al. (2003) and Huffman et al. (2007). Subject demographics have little influence on valuation differences, although GM potato products are not discounted relative to conventional products, nor are there significant anchoring effects. Related results appear in Colson et al. (2011), but we cannot separate the impacts on transgenic versus intragenic technologies since our biotech products only rely on genes from other potato varieties. We add to the recent literature on labeling, such as Liaukonyte et al. (2013), Gracia et al. (2011), and Dannenberg et al. (2011). Relative to mean WTP for conventional products (Table 3.2) or mean WTP differences (Table 3.1), the size of information effects are quite large. This may be of further interest to industry and government stakeholders. Our estimates of information effects contribute to a growing literature analyzing the role of information in behavioral economics (Chetty, 2015). Several field experiments show that providing basic information to consumers can substantially improve decision making and economic outcomes. For example, Bhargava and Manoli (2014) find that simplified information and benefit displays in experimental mailings to US taxpayers eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit significantly increase take-up rates. In a school choice setting, the fraction of low-income parents choosing high-performing schools significantly increases after receiving information on school test scores (Hastings and Weinstein, 2008). Our study suggests basic scientific and industry information on biotechnologies and acrylamide increases consumers' valuations for popular biotech foods and could aid the expansion of markets for foods using genetic modification to reduce food safety concerns. Importantly, scientific information and industry information can be used to \"nudge\" consumers in a direction to improve the quality of decision making. Disentangling the potential interactions between consumers' prior knowledge of biotechnology and experience with biotech foods, food labels, and information required for updating beliefs is a challenging economic problem. Our results, aided by experimental control, shed light on how various groups (often with conflicting economic objectives) can influence consumer WTP. Low-acrylamide biotech potatoes have been recently approved in the US for commercial sale. This brings an opportunity to considerably reduce a principal source of carcinogens in the US diet. Consumer and producer acceptance of these biotech foods will, in large part, be determined by the relative success of these groups in influencing public opinion. Toward a goal of improving US health outcomes, our results demonstrate the importance of information disseminated by scientific and biotech food groups in increasing acceptance and demand for low-acrylamide products made using biotechnology.

FORECAST EVALUATION AND ROBUSTNESS", "text": "A.1 Summary data and forecast evaluation Table A.1 reports descriptive statistics for the climate variables used as regressors in the long run analysis (except intense rainfall events, reported here as the difference of averaged integer events). For each row, the variable is constructed to be the 2007-2011 average minus the 1960-1964 average, where smoothing reduces bias from outlier years. Average May temperature has declined by one-quarter of one degree Celsius, though June and August temperatures have risen by a little over one-half degree. There is also variation in July and August months with average maximum temperatures above 85 \u2022 F but has small average impacts. Accompanying a moderate change in early-season temperatures has been a relatively large increase in early-season precipitation. May and June precipitation have risen by 1.80 and 4.17 cm, while late-season increases have been modest. This is further reflected in intense rainfall trends. The increase in extreme rainfall is concentrated in June, which has experienced almost one additional day of intense rainfall over the 52-year period. However, intensification of average precipitation has occurred in all growing season months but with important regional variability. Spatial variation in late-season precipi- and August 2011 average and intense precipitation are 0.69, 0.82, 0.75, and 0.72. These correlations are similar in magnitude across sample years. Average weather is a poor substitute for extreme weather, but strong correlations imply that there could be imprecise estimates from models with both sets of precipitation variables due to multicollinearity (e.g., Figure A.5 below). As a final check, we perform out-of-sample forecast assessment in Table A.2 using a mean absolute deviation (MAD) criterion. The absolute value of the difference in forecasts and realized yields across both model specifications for years 2012-14 is averaged over sample counties. Yield data are not available for 25, 62, and 62 separate counties in the three years. The models have similar results, but the baseline specification gives somewhat more accurate predictions with an average MAD of 32 bu/ac. The alternative model, which accounts for extreme weather, performed slightly better in a drought year with extreme heat and little rainfall (2012). With improved growing conditions (more optimal weather) in 2013, there is an improvement in forecast accuracy and a preference for the baseline model. The baseline preference continues into 2014. "}, {"section_title": "A.2 Forecast robustness", "text": "Figures A.3-A.9 present variations of the regression specification for the baseline and alternative models. We consider the possibility that yields are influenced by: (i). a linear time trend, (ii). the baseline model with temperature-precipitation interactions, (iii). both sets of baseline and alternative weather variables, (iv). an additional linear trend beginning in 1996 (the commercialization of glyphosate-tolerant corn), (v). two-inch daily precipitation instead of one-inch daily precipitation, and (vi). average and extreme GDD and precipitation. These are useful robustness checks and lend comparability with other studies. Figure A.3 answers the question of how yields would evolve by 2031 without weather shocks. This reflects some breeders' viewpoint that short-run weather fluctuations do not alter long-run genetic gain. Although this is a simplistic representation of yieldweather dynamics, the linear trend extrapolation provides a useful benchmark for forecast comparison. We find that the majority of counties will realize yields of 200-250 bu/ac in 2031, with the highest-yielding counties in the traditional Corn Belt. This agrees with the linear trend forecasts in Miranowski et al. (2011). In the absence of weather inputs, there are uniformly high yields (150-250 bu/ac) with very few outlying counties. This suggests that technologies designed to offset adverse climate impacts would be valuable measured in real terms. There are several other specifications designed to examine the impacts of weather on yields. Among them is a model imposing that the marginal productivities of temperature are affected by precipitation, and conversely. This is consistent with the agronomy literature's emphasis of limiting factors in corn production, e.g., the marginal productivity of water differs according to the presence and magnitude of heat stress. Though there are small within-month correlations of temperature and precipitation, Figure A.4 illustrates forecasts that are similar to our preferred baseline results. 1 The Corn Belt remains highly productive, with several northern counties experiencing the highest yields. These are plausible forecasts assuming that relatively cool temperatures continue to complement abundant rainfall."}, {"section_title": "A.2.1 Regression specification", "text": "One interpretation of our two specifications is that they arise as special cases of a more general model that includes both sets of weather inputs. By using the union of regressors, our Bayesian dynamic model updates (estimates) 16 regression coefficients for each county in each year. This is disadvantageous because of multicollinearity among average and extreme weather measures and fewer degrees of freedom. Figure A.5 shows the poor forecasting results. There is much local variability, and spatial patterns are inconsistent with historical data. Although it is useful to fit nested models that facilitate use of standard testing procedures (e.g., through calculation of usual F statistics), the inadequate model performance validates our preference for the two nonnested specifications. Another common viewpoint holds that biotechnologies have brought about fundamental changes to the nature of corn production. Higher yields are more likely in the  McFadden and Miranowski, 2015). A strong version of this hypothesis is that biotechnologies have caused a transformation of the yield distribution from one that is symmetric and thick-tailed to another that has more negative skew and smaller variance. Although we do not attempt to test a distributional change, our dynamic model is more suited to addressing the issue of mean and variance shifts over time than past studies. Figures A.6 and A.7 present the baseline and alternative 2031 forecasts that include an additional indicator variable that equals one in all years past 1995. This proxies for a linear yield bump due to biotechnologies sustained beyond the commercial introduction of Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) corn in 1996. We find that our main results are robust: forecasts differ somewhat quantitatively, but the most and least productive counties and associated yields are similar. Interestingly, our forecasts replicate a biotechnology yield gain. The average baseline 2031 yield forecast is 2.8 bu/ac higher with the 1996 trend, while the average alternative 2031 yield forecast is 5.2 bu/ac higher with the same trend. These are within the [0.9, 13.8] bu/ac range estimated by Nolan and Santos 2012  The precise definition of intense rainfall in climatology and agricultural meteorology is still subject to debate. Certain studies use the 99 th (or higher) percentiles of empirical rainfall distributions, while others use hourly thresholds or one-to four-inch daily thresholds . As a check of sensitivity to the one-inch daily rainfall regressors, we re-estimate the alternative model using two-inch daily rainfall events. Since there are 140 counties (18% of sample counties) that do not receive two inches of 24-hour rainfall during the growing season in 1960-2011, we use two-way fixed effects panel estimation to account for multiple zeroes (see Section A.2.4). Figure A.8 illustrates that the alternative model forecasts are robust to using two-inch daily rainfall events. As expected, there are few differences between these forecasts and those in Figure A.19, partially resulting from the fixed effects estimation. The negative impacts of intense precipitation are small relative to the positive (and increasing) time effects. Even though two-inch daily precipitation is rarer than one-inch daily precipitation, the forecasts remain relatively unchanged from Figure A.19 because of similar regression effects. A final check on specification concerns the use of growing degree days (GDD) and extreme degree days (EDD). Despite their relatively ad hoc formulation and weak relationship to climate model output, agronomists and agricultural economists have consistently found significant contributions to yield (Schlenker et al., 2006;Desch\u00eanes and Greenstone, 2007;Schlenker and Roberts, 2009;Roberts et al., 2013;Ortiz-Bobea and Just, 2013). We use county data on monthly GDD in the 8-32 \u2022 C interval and monthly GDD over 34 \u2022 C as proxies for extreme heat (Schlenker et al., 2006;Schlenker and Roberts, 2009). In addition to the intercept, time trend, and these eight weather regressors, we add the four monthly average precipitation variables. For more similarity to past studies, the model Figure A.9 shows no major departures from our preferred baseline forecasts. The highest-yielding areas continue to be Iowa, Illinois, southern Minnesota, other Corn Belt areas, and eastern South Dakota. Although there are differences in forecast levels, the models have generally similar qualitative features, e.g., yield forecasts are in similar 50 bu/ac bins. The average 2031 forecast in this specification is 8.6 bu/ac higher than the baseline average for the same 711 counties ( Figure 5). "}, {"section_title": "A.2.2 Sensitivity to ending year", "text": "Dynamic forecasting results generally depend on coefficient estimates from the last in-sample year since they are extended into the forecasting time period. Figures A.10-A.13 illustrate the 2031 baseline and alternative forecasts from a model with a 51-year sample (ending in 2010) and a 53-year sample (ending in 2012). Relative to the baseline estimates, Figure A.10 shows a minor shift of higher yields towards counties north of the 45 th parallel, though the difference in average 2031 yields is 3.2 bu/ac. There is also little difference among the alternative forecasts for the 2010 versus 2011 ending year, with a 3.5 bu/ac difference between the average 2031 yield. Regional yield patterns in the results for the 2012 ending year are comparable, though the set of highest-yielding counties is smaller. This is because the extremely dry and hot conditions of 2012 produce larger negative (or smaller positive) weather elasticities. Average 2031 forecasts decline by 20 bu/ac and 26 bu/ac for the baseline and alternative models when the sample ends in 2012. "}, {"section_title": "A.2.3 Sensitivity to climate model", "text": "One potential concern when averaging climate model output is that extremes will tend to be smoothed, which could bias the results if measurement error is introduced. Several climatology studies find that multi-model ensembles give more accurate predictions, but it is useful to examine how forecasts change with model disaggregation. GCM output can differ for the same region and climate scenario because of differences in parameters, boundary settings, and other aspects of the physical modeling process. For example, the largest difference in May aggregate temperatures averaged over 2012-2031 for the four models is 0.7 \u2022 C. Average monthly precipitation aggregated across counties is more variable and differs by as much as 2.6 cm. In general, the GFDL model produces the most precipitation, while MIROC and HadGEM predict drier weather. The CCSM and GFDL models generate relatively warmer weather. Heterogeneity among GCMs is evidenced in the 2031 baseline forecasts of Figures A.14-A.17. The sole difference between Figure 5 and the baseline forecasts using only the CCSM output ( Figure A.14) is that eastern Wisconsin becomes more productive. Average 2031 yield under CCSM alone is 4.7 bu/ac lower than the baseline results that average the four models. Although GFDL generates relatively warmer weather, the additional average rainfall is beneficial. Yields increase in nearly all counties, with 2031 average yield increasing by 19.7 bu/ac relative to the main baseline specification. The HadGEM and MIROC-alone models forecast similar and similarly-low 2031 yields, consistent with their lower moisture. The relative yield decline is much more uniform in the HadGEM model. In contrast, counties in Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and the eastern Dakotas have the highest yields under the MIROC model. The average 2031 yield for these two latter models differ by 1.9 bu/ac and decrease from the main baseline results by 6.2 and 8.0 bu/ac. The conventional econometric approach in climate economics is fixed effects panel methods. However, our Bayesian filtering model addresses parameter instability, outliers, and information decay in a unified and rigorous way. This improves upon econometric methods that ignore these important issues identified in the agricultural economics literature. Key advantages of panel approaches are their greater degrees of freedom and ability to control for unobserved heterogeneity (e.g., county-level management practices and human capital). Figures A.18 and A.19 provide forecasts for the baseline and alternative specifications from a two-way fixed effects analysis. County fixed effects absorb the impacts of time-invariant production factors (e.g., soil productivity and local infrastructure), while time fixed effects capture discrete temporal impacts common to all counties (e.g., the 1970 Southern Corn Leaf Blight outbreak and, less importantly, the 2003 soybean aphid infestation). Although the full set of fixed effects absorbs a large amount of independent variation, the approach is plausible because of the relatively large sample (N = 40,040). For each specification, the forecasts are produced from a single estimated model and are thus spatially smooth. Standard errors are clustered by county. The most productive regions in both models continue to be the traditional Corn Belt and the Great Lakes, with a set of high-yielding counties in central Illinois. The baseline average 2031 yield is 6.4 bu/ac lower, whereas the average 2031 yield from the alternative panel model is 28 bu/ac higher.  Table A.3 addresses robustness of our long-run results to inclusion and exclusion of soil controls and state fixed effects. Since the long-run analysis uses cross-sectional variation, it is natural to control for regional variation in agricultural suitability for growing corn (e.g., soil productivity). Yet if soil productivity is additively separable from climate damages and time-invariant, then it differences out of the econometric model. Columns (1)-(4) of Table A.3 replicate those of Table 2.2 in the paper, except soil controls have been removed. Goodness-of-fit is similar across the tables, though with a 19-percentage point drop in column (3), suggesting that soils are not a primary determinant of rising corn productivity."}, {"section_title": "A.3 Productivity growth robustness", "text": "The signs and magnitudes of the climate coefficients are robust to the omission of soil productivity. Similar to results in Table 2.2, July and August temperature variable are unimportant. August temperatures are less important. A 1 \u2022 C increase in May temperature reduces productivity growth by 4-7 percentage points at the sample mean. A similar increase in June temperature has a -3 percentage point impact. However, yield productivity growth is increasing (at a diminishing rate) in July temperature, with an average 5 percentage point influence per 1 \u2022 C. The only substantive change in the alternative damage function estimates (the third and fourth columns) is more detrimental intense precipitation throughout the growing season. Soils play a small but significant role in agricultural adaptation (e.g., through water infiltration or absorption), and movement of coefficients in this direction is anticipated (McFadden and Miranowski, 2014). An additional percentage point in the fraction of days without intense rainfall in the four separate months increases productivity growth by 2%, 1%, 0.8%, and 0.6% (column 3). The fifth through eighth columns of Table A.3 show that many of the results are unchanged after adding state fixed effects (FE). State FE soak up geographic variation in the production environment not directly associated with soils (e.g., pest susceptibility, human capital, and quality of public extension services). Inference for the baseline damage function in columns (5) and (6) is similar to that of columns (1) and (2). May and June temperature have small negative, nonlinear effects on yield productivity growth, and July temperature has a small positive linear impact. Of more interest and potential policy relevance is inference from extreme climate damages. Harmful climate impacts on yield productivity growth decrease after including this richer set of controls. The marginal effect of a decade increase in which monthly maximum July and August temperatures exceed 85 \u2022 F is half the size of the main estimates in Table 2.2. Intense precipitation retains its negative impacts. An interesting commonality is the importance of August intense rainfall. An additional percentage point in the fraction of days in August without intense precipitation increases yield productivity growth by 0.8%.  The dependent variable in columns (1), (3), (5), and (7) is the difference in productivity estimated from the baseline model. The dependent variable in columns (2), (4), (6), and (8) is the difference in productivity estimated from the alternative model. Columns (1), (2), (5), and (6) use regressors similar to the baseline specification. Columns (3), (4), (7), and (8) use regressors from the alternative specification. Bootstrap standard errors are clustered by CRD (in parentheses). * p<0.1, * * p<0.05, * * * p<0.01. Another critique of our results concerns estimation of the Nordhaus (2013) damage function. There is uncertainty about the nature of climate change damages, and there is no consensus on the most appropriate functional form. A plausible alternative to the inverse quadratic function is Weitzman (2009) exponential damages: where (\u2206T it ) is temperature change for county i in year t, and \u03b5 it is an econometric error. This function may be preferred because of the relatively larger weight given to larger temperature changes. Table A.4 provides nonlinear least squares estimates for the alternative model and an analogous baseline specification. Coefficients on the quadratic temperature changes are very similar to those in Table 2.2, as well as those for the alternative model in the last two columns. There are also comparable marginal effects, after reflecting exp[\u2206T it ] across they y axis, in line with Weitzman's emphasis of relatively larger damages at higher temperatures. Our inference is largely robust to damage functional form assumption. Lastly, one might ask how a relatively simple model defined over climate change -not climate change damages -performs. Given unknown damages, it could be argued that a more conservative approach is to drop the damage function and (linearly) estimate the linear and quadratic climate effects. Estimates from linear regressions of productivity growth on climate change are presented in Table A.5. These estimates coincide with marginal effects. There are minor changes in magnitudes relative to the parameters in Table 2.2, and estimates retain the same sign (recall that coefficients of Table 2.2 are in the damage function's denominator). As in the previous sections, we again confirm the robustness of our long-run analysis.  3is the difference in productivity estimated from the baseline model. The dependent variable in columns (2) and (4) is the difference in productivity estimated from the alternative model. Columns (1) and (2) use regressors similar to the baseline specification. Columns (3) and (4) use regressors from the alternative specification. Bootstrap standard errors are clustered by CRD (in parentheses).  (Bresnahan and Gordon, 1997). Some of these goods reduce the probability of humans getting sick, which can result in temporary illnesses -causing loss of utilityor even terminal illnesses that shorten one's expected length of life. One strand of the literature on valuing new goods is a virtual price model of household demand (Hausman, 1997). A second strand of the literature is experimental lab auctions of new goods (Hoffman et al., 1992;Lusk and Shogren, 2007). In particular, Colson and Huffman 2011 Patterson, 1967;Shiraishi, 1978;Naruszewicz et al., 2009;JECFA, 2011;Nixon et al., 2012). Medical research uses clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory data, but most are laboratory studies of rats and mice that have been exposed to acrylamide (similar to much other medical research). These studies have premises (OAG, 2008). These warnings, designed to promote public health, may reduce 2 Acrylamide concentrations in potatoes vary widely as a function of reducing sugar content and cooking temperatures, though concentrations in chips and fries are 100-1000 \u00b5g kg \u22121 and 100-700 \u00b5g kg \u22121 , respectively. US per capita use of white potatoes in 2013 is approximately the same as in 1980, about 115 lbs., but the share going to processed foods increased from 53% to 69%. Since some of the potato is lost in processing waste, per capita consumption of potatoes has declined over this period (Institute of Medicine, 2015). potato consumption or lower utility from fixed consumption, depending on specification of preferences (Becker and Murphy, 1993). Thus, it is economically interesting to determine consumers' valuations for conventional potatoes (perceived by some consumers to have risk from potential carcinogens but no risk from genetic engineering) and biotech potatoes (perceived by some to have risk from genetic engineering but no risk from potential carcinogens), and the effects of information and labeling on these valuations. However, not a single human health problem has resulted from 20 years of human consumption of GM foods. The objective of this paper is to assess consumers' valuation for a new food product that has greatly reduced food safety concerns achieved using genetic engineering. To do this, we design and conduct lab auctions of three popular food items in the American diet: fresh whole potatoes, frozen French fries, and chips. Although economists sometimes use Vickrey (1961) second-price auctions to identify a single winner in auctions of a single commodity, we choose a random n th -price auction (Shogren et al., 2001). When subjects have heterogeneous preferences, as reflected in willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a food product, the random n th -price auction has been shown to be superior for revealing private valuations than the second-price auction. This occurs because every subject in a lab session has a positive probability of winning the random n th -price auction (there can be multiple winners), whereas the Vickrey auction chooses a single winner, irrespective of the number of bidders. The second-price auction is marginally superior to a random n th -price auction when a single winner is to be identified, but it does not suit our needs for assessing the distribution of WTP for a product. The subjects in these auctions are 304 randomly-chosen adults (18-65 years of age) from diversion regions of the United States -Boston, Des Moines, and Los Angeles, who are paid to come to nearby locations and participate in our lab auctions. Our empirical results show strong combined labeling and information treatments effects. Consumers are willing to pay more for low-acrylamide fresh potatoes, potato chips, and frozen French fries when they receive a scientific perspective on acrylamide, an industry perspective on reducing acrylamide using biotech methods, or a combination of the two. We find that the scientific and industry perspectives have additive effects on WTP, and subjects do not anchor on a particular information perspective. WTP is not significantly affected by several socio-demographic attributes of subjects. Hence, the empirical evidence is that consumers will pay for improved food safety (reduced acrylamide formation in cooked potato products) achieved using biotech methods. The remainder of this paper has the following organization. The next section briefly surveys the related literature. Section 3 outlines the experimental design and research hypotheses, while the subsequent section presents the econometric model and data. Section "}, {"section_title": "Past research", "text": "The current study stems from past applied work on incentive-compatible elicitation mechanisms, food experiments, and experiments involving information and labeling treatments. For the past half-century, economists have used the the Vickrey (1961) secondprice auction to learn about consumer WTP. Subjects submit private bids, and the highest bidder wins but pays the second-highest price. Since the weakly dominant strategy is sincere bidding, the auction is said to be incentive compatible (Hurwicz, 1972). Secondprice auctions remain widely used because of their incentive-compatible properties and ease of implementation. Another common method of eliciting consumer valuations is the Becker et al. (1964) mechanism (hereafter denoted as BDM). In this value elicitation procedure, subjects are asked to report their WTP for a good (or group of goods) and then a random price is drawn, typically from a uniform distribution. Those whose valuations are higher than the random price receive the good and pay the random price, whereas subjects with a WTP less than the random price do not receive the good and pay nothing. The BDM device is therefore incentive compatible. Shogren et al. (2001) builds on the BDM mechanism and Vickrey auction with a mechanism known as random n th -price auctions. In this method, after participants bid on the experimental product, a random number, n, is drawn uniformly on [2, k], where k is the number of session participants. The bids are then ranked from highest to lowest. Those who bid higher than the n th bid are winners but pay the n th bid, not their submitted bid. As in the BDM, the bidders' dominant strategy is to truthfully reveal their valuations. 3 Shogren et al. (2001) argues that random n th -price auctions are desirable because of engaging \"off-margin\" bidders, i.e., low-value subjects still have a positive probability of winning. Using an experiment with induced values, the authors find more sincere bidding from low-value individuals in the random n th -price auction than the Vickrey auction. 4 Early studies on information treatments in experimental auctions for food products are Menkhaus et al. (1992), Hoffman et al. (1992), and Schmitz et al. (1993). Fifth-price auctions with repeated trials were conducted in the Denver and Los Angeles areas to assess WTP for beef steaks. The experimenters were interested in the marketing viability of a new beef steak packaging -vacuum-sealed packaging -relative to conventional packaging in an overwrapped styrofoam tray. Regarding information treatments, there is a no-information baseline; verbal information about vacuum-sealing benefits, beef coloration, and meat juices; and verbal information plus a demonstration of beef coloration upon vacuum package removal. They find that information treatments, income, household size, employment, beef shape, and \"all natural\" labels significantly influence the WTP difference between vacuum-sealed and plastic overwrapped steaks. There are also significant health effects: cholesterol concerns substantially reduced WTP, regardless of packaging. The artefactual field experiment performed here also draws from, and parallels, studies on food safety valuation. One well-known work in the agricultural economics literature is Hayes et al. (1995). Using Vickrey auctions, the authors obtained two types of valuations from 230 Iowa State University (ISU) undergraduates: (i). bids to \"upgrade\" an endowed meat sandwich with \"typical\" risk of a foodborne pathogen to a meat sandwich with very low risk, and (ii). compensation bids to \"downgrade\" from an endowed very low-risk sandwich to the \"typical\" sandwich. After 10 rounds of bidding, subjects were given information on one of five pathogens (related to probabilities of becoming ill and health severity), and then bid an additional 10 times. Among their main findings are that subjects place a $0.70 per-meal premium on food safety and tend to weight their own prior beliefs about the odds of illness more heavily than new information. Our methodology improves on this early study by: (i). eliminating endowment effects and framing, e.g., we do not mention \"upgrade\" between products; (ii). removing the possibility of correlated bidding by not posting winning bids after each bidding round; and (iii). implementing an auction format that performs better in practice, e.g., engages lowvalue subjects. Another closely related food safety study is Fox et al. (2002). Again using Vickrey auctions, the researchers find that positive information about food irradiation increases WTP for pork sandwiches that have been irradiated to kill the Trichinella parasite. They also find that negative information exerts downward pressure on bids, with similarly lower valuations from subjects receiving positive and negative information. Since the wider adoption of laboratory experimental methods in agricultural economics, there has been a sharp rise in publications examining information and labeling effects on food values (Noussair et al., 2002;Huffman et al., 2003;Huffman et al., 2007;Rousu et al., 2007;Lusk and Briggeman, 2009;Kanter et al., 2009;Gracia et al., 2011;Liaukonyte et al., 2013). Although these studies use different experimental methods, one commonality is that prior beliefs, information treatments, labels and seals, and framing have substantial effects on consumer values (Colson and Rousu, 2013). In certain studies, information and labeling effects can be isolated to look at very specific influences on WTP. However, disentangling the effects of food labels, new infor-mation, and prior beliefs can be difficult. This is a major reason for using laboratory auctions to identify consumer WTP."}, {"section_title": "Experimental design", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Overview", "text": "To create significant regional diversity in our subjects, we choose to conduct experiments in three areas: Boston, Los Angeles, and Des Moines.

There are two concurrent sessions at each starting time, so there are a total of six sessions (3x2) at each site. Our sample comprises 304 subjects."}, {"section_title": "Survey and Behavioral Research Services (SBRS) at Iowa State University developed", "text": "the protocol for recruiting participants. A random sample of households was contacted to determine if there was an eligible individual to participate in group sessions in a project by Iowa State University on how people select food and household products. Recruiters were seeking adults who were 18-65 years of age who could follow directions and write in English, and could come on a target date to a laboratory site. In particular, they were told that the sessions involve a food preference experiment set up like an auction or bidding activity, and they would be paid $65 for about an hour of their time. Willing subjects were asked to pick among the three available starting times. They were told that there would be follow-up communication confirming time and location and directions to the lab site. SBRS undertook recruitment for the Des Moines area. They started with a set of random telephone numbers. When a willing participant was obtained, the individual was also permitted to suggest the name of other family members and friends that might be willing to participate in the experiments, sometimes referenced as \"snowball\" recruiting. To obtain subjects in Los Angeles and Boston, we worked with two marketing research companies -Focus and Testing and Answer Quest. Focus and Testing randomly sampled from its subject pool of 100,000 adults in the Los Angeles area, and Answer Quest randomly sampled from its subject pool of 60,000 adults in the Boston area. These recruits had participated in one or more prior marketing research projects undertaken by these companies but not experimental auctions. Recruitment at the latter two sites was similar to the Des Moines area, except that subjects were not permitted to suggest names of other possible recruits, and there was a 60-40 female-male division of recruits. This was to insure that subjects matched the gender ratio of the population of US grocery store shoppers. 5 We measure WTP for the following products: potatoes (Russet, 5 lbs.), potato chips (classic-cut, 12 oz.), and frozen French fries (crinkle-cut, 2 lbs.). We offer a diverse set of commodities because of the experiment's high fixed costs and subjects' heterogeneous preferences. These potato products are good sources of potassium and fiber but differ according to preparation and eating time, convenience, and storability (Institute of Medicine, 2015). 6 Each product has two types, conventional (available in grocery store) and low-acrylamide using biotechnology (truly experimental products). Low-acrylamide products using biotechnology had not been deregulated by the USDA for commercial sale at the time of the experiment. 7 However, the J.R. Simplot Company had low-acrylamide, biotech potato products under development that would meet our display needs, which they provided as display products for the bidding rounds. At the end of each session, all subjects were told that only conventional potato products were available to take home on the day of the experiment. Our experiments provide two types of information to subjects: food labels and prepackaged information. All commodities are packaged in transparent plastic (not commercial packaging) to focus attention on the food labels. Conventional products carry a plain label briefly describing the product and net weight. The low-acrylamide, biotech products have labels that briefly describe the product, including \"low acrylamide,\" and net weight but also include the added information: \"Product Made Using Biotechnology.\" These labels are affixed to the front of each product's packaging. Information about the harmful impacts of acrylamides exposure used in the scientific perspective are from various medical journal articles and government reports (Garland and Patterson, 1967;Shiraishi, 1978;Naruszewicz et al., 2009;JECFA, 2011;Nixon et al., 2012). For the environmental group perspective, many statements are based on claims from Antoniou et al. (2012) and the Non-GMO Project's website, www.nongmoproject.org. As with other design features, the information perspectives were pretested and subsequently revised on several occasions prior to implementation in the experiment. With order effects, there are a total of nine distinct information treatments: (1). industry perspective only, (2). scientific perspective only, (3). environmental group 8 We do not suggest that all environmental groups view GM products negatively. Environmental non-profit organizations have very diverse objectives, such as conservation of wetlands, freshwater rivers, and bird habitats. This perspective only refers to groups that are opposed to biotechnology. Our choice of the term \"environmental group\" was guided by similar studies in the food auctions literature. 9 Our design does not test \"authority\" effects. A potentially interesting design alternative would assign information perspectives that have identical content but attributions to differing groups. perspective only, (4). industry then scientific perspective, (5). scientific then industry perspective, (6). industry then environmental perspective, (7). environmental then industry perspective, (8). scientific then environmental perspective, and (9). environmental then scientific perspective. Each subject is randomly assigned one of the information treatments in their packet with the protocol for the experiment. 10 The design of the experiments introduces randomness at several levels. First, subjects are recruited randomly. Second, subjects are randomly assigned to a packet containing the protocol and information treatment. Third, they are alternately assigned to one of two concurrent sessions. Fourth, the order of bidding on products across four rounds of bidding is randomized (e.g., we randomly select the order of conventional versus biotech products). Fifth, we randomly select one of the two rounds of bidding on conventional products as the binding round. This multilevel randomized design permits simpler identification and obviates controlling for selection effects (Lusk and Shogren, 2007;Glennerster and Takavarasha, 2013)."}, {"section_title": "Timeline of subject activities", "text": "We now briefly review the steps of a typical auction session to provide a more detailed description. Figure 2 is a flowchart of these steps. Upon arriving at the experimental site, participants read and sign an informed consent sheet, required for human subjects research. After agreeing to participate, subjects are given an ID number and are randomly assigned to one of two concurrent sessions and a packet (random assignment to treatment). 11 They are then instructed to begin completing the pre-auction questionnaire. The 19 questions in the pre-auction questionnaire mainly relate to demographics, prior knowledge about acrylamide, biotech foods, and non-biotech foods, and health (subjective risk for developing cancer and current level of hunger). We distribute a $65 10 No participant received a treatment consisting of all three information perspectives. This reduces subject burden and session lengths. 11 Individuals who arrive together (e.g., friends and family members) are placed in separate sessions, unless special circumstances require assignment to the same session. In this case, we ask that they do not sit next to each other, unless this is also necessary for extenuating reasons. There were very few such instances. participation fee and have participants sign a receipt while they begin completing the pre-auction questionnaire. Subjects are told to turn off electronic devices and not talk with other participants. After all subjects have completed the pre-auction questionnaire, session monitors tell subjects that they will be participating in an experimental auction and explain how the auction works. Subjects are also notified that they can win at most one unit of each commodity. At this stage of the experiment, subjects are allowed and encouraged to ask clarifying questions. We proceed to one of two practice rounds once any questions have been addressed. 12 The commodity in the first practice round is a ceramic mug. Subjects are asked to come to the front of the room, view the mug, return to their seats, and write down bids. The session monitor and assistant then collect and rank the bids (in a spreadsheet), randomly draw the binding round, and determine the winner(s) via the auction rules. 13 After the first practice round, a brief quiz is administered to check understanding of the auction rules. We allow subjects four to five minutes to finish the quiz and then review the answers with additional explanation. In the second practice round, subjects gain experience placing three bids at one time on a notepad, binder, and a package of pens. Bids for the three products are sorted separately and displayed, and \"winner\" IDs are revealed. There are two distinct rounds of bidding on the three potato products after completion of the practice rounds. As in the practice rounds, subjects are asked to come to the front of the room, view the products, return to their seats, and write their bids on a bid sheet. Subjects are not allowed to pick up the products. 14 After bid sheets have 12 The use of practice rounds in economics experiments is not universally accepted. Some studies indicate training could influence bids via incidental prices or coherent arbitrariness (Ariely et al., 2003;Nunes and Boatwright, 2004). However, we agree with Plott and Zeiler (2005) and Lusk and Shogren (2007) that practice rounds boost understanding, lower the possibility of subject misconceptions, and do not alter subjects' underlying values for products. Further, our non-food practice round items are neutral relative to the experimental commodities. 13 Since there is only one round of bidding in each practice round, and the practice round is not binding, there is no need to randomly select the binding round. At this stage, we show an example so that subjects will understand the procedure in the later, actual rounds of bidding. 14 Subjects are permitted to touch the commodities' packaging. Peck and Shu (2009) find that, across a wide array of household objects, simply touching an item can increase perceived ownership, which raises valuations if the object does not provide negative sensory feedback. We expect that prohibiting subjects from picking up the products will not influence our results, given consumers' widespread experience with conventional potato products. been collected, subjects are given approximately ten minutes to read their assigned information treatment. 15 Subjects then bid again on both sets of products, and bid sheets are collected. The only posted bids are those for the binding type (conventional) in the binding round at the end of the auctions. Note that subjects are bidding on a separate set of products for each of the four rounds. However, both sets of conventional products have identical packaging and labeling and look very similar, as do the biotech products. Subjects are then asked to complete a post-auction questionnaire with 21 questions. We ask participants about monthly purchases, weekly consumption, and household inventories of potato products and their complements and substitutes. Additional questions concern health-related indicators and subjects' level of understanding and agreement with the information perspectives. In the final stage of a session, the binding round, random n, winning prices, and winning IDs are revealed. Subjects are told that only the conventional products are available to the winners. For purposes of product control, we randomly choose the binding conventional round and random n prior to all sessions. After inputting bids for the binding round into a spreadsheet, the bids for all products are projected at the front of each session's room, and subjects watch as the session monitor ranks the bids and reveals the winning IDs. Winners are then directed to a \"stockroom\" to purchase the won item(s). 16 Questionnaires are quickly checked to ensure completion prior to each subject's departure."}, {"section_title": "Research hypotheses", "text": "The experimental design and corresponding questionnaire data permit the following testable hypotheses, among others: 15 To ensure that outside information does not contaminate any specific treatment, session monitors and assistants do not answer questions related to informational content. To avoid confusion, we state that subjects will have either one or two pages of information. This added piece of information about the design is not expected to substantially influence the treatments' efficacy or bidding behavior. 16 Demand reduction is an unlikely problem in our setting. This is because subjects are not bidding on multiple units of the same commodity. Rather, they are bidding on commodities that are not strong complements or substitutes. Although demand reduction can occur when auctioning many units of the same good (Corrigan and Rousu, 2006), this is not problematic when the goods are unrelated in consumption (Lusk and Shogren, 2007). 1. Scientific information about presence of acrylamide in potato products increases WTP for GM potato products. 2. An industry perspective on reducing acrylamide content in potato products using GM technologies increases WTP for GM potato products. 3. Combinations of two information perspectives may have larger or smaller effects on WTP than single information perspectives. 4. Subjects' demographics, prior knowledge, beliefs, and health affect WTP. 5. The order in which subjects receive information affects WTP. However, this list of hypotheses is incomplete. The questionnaires elicit many kinds of information, motivated by previous economics or marketing studies. Additional research will consider the impacts of self-assessed cancer risk on WTP differences, in addition to stock or \"household inventory\" effects. 3.4 Econometric model and data"}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "Our questionnaires provide a much richer dataset than most experimental studies and some marketing research. The extensive data collection arises, in part, because of limited understanding of general trends across marketing research. We draw on past food experiment research, economic theory, and practical considerations to guide question choice in the questionnaires. 19 The resulting questionnaire data can be classified into four groups: (i). demographics, (ii). subject attributes, (iii). health and diet, and (iv). food product flows and stocks. Four subjects had missing data and were excluded from the analysis, leaving a sample of 300. Of these 300 observations, there are 3-5 double-zero bids for potatoes, 9-13 doublezero bids for French fries, and 6-10 double-zero bids for potato chips. Roughly 4.7% of the potatoes bids are single-zero bids, 4.9-5.8% of the French fry bids are single-zero bids, and 4.8-5.8% of the potato chips bids are single-zero bid (not including double-zero bids). The number of reported zero bids represents the maximum number of possible censored bid differences. Summary statistics for the sample are reported in Table 3.1 for all 300 subjects for all of their bids on all products.  Capra et al. (2010) show that induced positive moods are associated with roughly 11% overbidding on products with induced values. However, mood has weak or no effects on WTP for movie tickets (a good with \"homegrown\" value). Our experiment does not control for mood or a host of other psychological or mental states that could potentially affect values or results in a between-subjects analysis. receive information. This is part of a broader downward trend in post-information bids for all commodities. Summary statistics of variables in this analysis are contained in Table 3.2. The descriptive statistics for WTP differences confirm that valuations for the biotech products decline after receiving information treatments. For example, average WTP for the biotech potatoes is $0.11 lower after reading information treatments, while WTP for conventional potatoes before information is roughly $0.13 higher than WTP for low-acrylamide potatoes after information. This trend is similar for French fries and potato chips, though potato chips have the smallest WTP differences at roughly $0.07-$0.08. There is substantial variability in WTP differences across commodities, with standard deviations ranging from $1.17 to $1.67. A sizeable asymmetry exists between maximum and minimum WTP differences. Some individuals value the biotech products $7-$10 less after receiving information. However, upward influences on WTP are roughly half this size at $4-$7. This suggests that marketers should carefully consider the potential consequences of advertising on information-sensitive consumers. Note that the data are not being skewed by extreme underrepresentation or overrepresentation of potato product consumers, and we did not randomly select our sample on this criterion. On average, 64% of subjects are from households that consume potatoes once or twice per week, 53% consume French fries once or twice per week, and 49% consume potato chips with this regularity. The \"average household\" has a respondent who is 43 years old with 14.4 years of schooling, living with one other adult in the household, and maintaining a per-person annual pre-tax income of $28,550. 21 Roughly 42% and 49% of the sample were at least somewhat informed about biotech and non-biotech food products prior to the experiment (\"Previously informed about biotech\" and \"Previously informed about non-biotech\"), and 88% read labels at least some of the time when buying new food products (\"Looks at labels\"). On average, 22% of the subjects came with another experiment participant (\"Arrived with someone else\") and traveled just over nine miles to reach the site (\"Dis-tance traveled\"). 22 In general, there is considerable variation in subject demographics, particularly in per-person incomes and previous knowledge of biotech and non-biotech food products. 23 Regarding health, diet, and exercise, 83% are in at least good health (\"Healthy\"), with 75% of the sample exercising at least twice per week (\"Exercises regularly\"). These health measures are, on average, consistent with the fact that only 15% of the sample are smokers, and 38% are in households with at least one person dieting. Interestingly, 65% of subjects are at least moderately hungry at the beginning of the experiment (\"Hungry\"). Many previous food experiments do not control for degree of hunger or diet, although these would be expected to have straightforward effects on WTP and possibly WTP differences. As with other studies, we cannot verify subjective assessments of participants' own health and exercise status. Other controls include the number of children in the household less than or equal to 12 years of age (\"Number of preteen children\") and number of children in the household aged thirteen years or older (\"Number of teen children\"). Aspects of the experimental design are also included in the analysis. There is a roughly equal distribution of sessions across the three sites, though Los Angeles contains 35% of all sessions (\"LA site\"). Exactly half of the subjects are assigned to one of two monitor's (\"Monitor\") concurrent sessions, and they are equally distributed across the 9:00 a.m., 11:00 a.m., and 1:30 p.m. starting times (\"11:00 a.m. session\" and \"1:30 p.m. session\"). 24 Lastly, the distribution of information treatments is given at the bottom of Table 3.\n"}, {"section_title": "Our target was an equal", "text": "22 Subjects in the Des Moines area consisted of randomly-dialed participants, returning participants from a previous food experiment, and contacts of randomly-dialed participants. This substantially reduced recruitment expense. However, we are not concerned about correlated bids, dependent data, or an unrepresentative sample for the following reasons: (i). subjects who arrive with other subjects are assigned to different concurrent sessions, (ii). the auctions are incentive compatible, regardless of subjects' familiarity with other subjects, (iii). the sample matches several key dimensions of the population of US grocery shoppers, and (iv). these types of recruits comprise less than 25% of our sample. 23 Roughly 76% of the sample is white, a consequence of the eligibility requirement that subjects can read and write English. This has some bearing on average demographics, but Table 3.2 confirms there is ample variation in our data. Although our sample is quite diverse, our results generalize mainly to the population of English-speaking US grocery shoppers. 24 Rather than include design controls in the regression analysis, we could perform Chow, Kruskal-Wallis, or other tests of the appropriateness of pooling across experimental sites and starting times. Direct inclusion in the regression is straightforward and does not rely on small subsamples for estimation of other parameters. distribution of treatments across subjects: 16.67%. Approximately 19% of the sample received the industry-only statement, 18% received the scientific-only statement, 17% received a combination of the industry and scientific statements, and similarly for the other treatments. The environmental-only treatment is the reference category. 25"}, {"section_title": "Empirical results", "text": "\nThe empirical findings are presented and discussed in the following order: spring crop choice, conditional spring crop acreage, fall crop choice, and conditional fall crop acreage. For each regressor in the crop choice models, we present the average of the marginal effect over the sample. Marginal effects need not have the same sign as coefficient estimates in multinomial logit models (Greene, 2011). Many of the soil characteristics are significant at the 10% level or better, but these are not reported to keep the set of results manageable. Appendix C contains first-step estimates in which: (i). fields that have nothing planted are added back to the analysis, and (ii). standard errors are clustered by county. Table 4.5 reports the climate, economic, and management marginal effects on crop choice for spring observations. In general, many of the coefficients (not reported) are statistically significant at the 5% and 1% significance levels, with adequate goodness of fit. Average precipitation is also significant across nearly all months. An additional inch of May precipitation increases the probability of choosing corn and no-till soybeans by two to six percentage points. June has similar negative effects on no-till corn and soybeans."}, {"section_title": "Information ordering effects", "text": "First, we explore the significance of information-perspective ordering effects. Subjects who are randomly assigned to one of the six treatments with two perspectives may place more emphasis on the first (or second) perspective. That is, subjects may anchor on either of the perspectives. If this occurs, coefficient estimates across these treatments would differ depending on information perspective ordering. To test this joint hypothesis, equations (1)-(6) are estimated with indicators for fine information treatments, i.e., we include indicators for subjects whose packets include the industry perspective first and scientific perspective second, industry perspective second and scientific perspective first, and so on. Regression coefficients are not displayed but are similar to coefficients in Tables 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6 below. The environmental-only perspective is the reference category. Table 3.3 presents the results of the joint F -test. For each of the six regressions, the joint null hypothesis is \u03b2 SI = \u03b2 IS , \u03b2 IE = \u03b2 EI , \u03b2 SE = \u03b2 ES . Note that \u03b2 SI is the coefficient on the indicator for the treatment in which the scientific perspective is first and the industry perspective is second, \u03b2 IS is the coefficient on the indicator for the treatment in which the industry perspective is first and the scientific perspective is second, \u03b2 IE is the coefficient on the indicator for the treatment in which the industry perspective is first and the environmental perspective is second, etc. We cannot reject the null hypothesis (at the 5% significance level) that the order in which subjects read the information has no effect. This lack of asymmetry indicates that subjects with two perspectives actively consider both when forming their WTP, i.e., there is no anchoring effect. One practical implication is that in advertising projects, marketers may not need to be concerned about the order in which information is displayed to consumers. Table 3.4 contains regression results on WTP differences for potatoes. The dependent variable for columns (1a) and (1b) is Bid GM P ot post \u2212 Bid GM P ot pre , the WTP difference for biotech potatoes pre-and post-information. The dependent variable for columns (2a) and (2b) is Bid GM P ot post \u2212 Bid ConvP ot pre , the WTP difference for biotech potatoes postinformation and conventional potatoes pre-information. Note that (1b) and (2b) are reduced versions of (1a) and (2a). 26 The first two columns point to large information effects significant at the 1% level. Relative to those receiving the environmental group-only treatment, the industry-only treatment increases WTP for biotech potatoes by $1.17 and the scientific-only treatment increases WTP by $1.91. The relative impact of receiving either combination of both industry and scientific perspectives is $1.78, which appears to be a weighted average of the industry-only and scientific-only perspectives. The relative effects on WTP for the industry and environmental treatments and the scientific and environmental treatments are similar at $1.04 and $1.01. The reduction in magnitude suggests that the \"environmental group\" perspective (negative on biotechnologies) decreases the positive WTP effects of the industry-only and scientific-only perspectives."}, {"section_title": "WTP and the value of information", "text": "Estimated information effects in the reduced model (1b) are largely robust to dropping insignificant demographic variables. Insignificant health and child controls and design controls (see Table 3.2) are also dropped in model (1b). 27 We reject the null hypothesis that all coefficients equal zero (the likelihood ratio test statistics of 70.9-74.6 exceed the relevant 5% critical values of the \u03c7 2 distributions). The informational impacts in models (2a) and (2b) are similar but differ in exact size across treatments. Those receiving the industry-only perspective have increased WTP by $0.98, while those reading the scientific-only perspective have increased WTP by $1.37, relative to those getting the environmental-only statement. However, the effect of getting either combination of both perspectives is $1.63, which exceeds each of the individual information effects. This suggests that a pairing of negative information on acrylamides and positive information on low-acrylamide levels and biotechnologies raises WTP across the mixed commodity type. In particular, marketers may want to emphasize both kinds of information in a transition from conventional potatoes to low-acrylamide biotech potatoes. As with the other regressions, the combinations of industry and environmental perspectives and the combinations of scientific and environmental perspectives have smaller WTP effects than their individual perspectives. Results are generally unchanged in reduced model (2b). The somewhat differing information effects in the mixed commodity type suggest there could be other factors influencing the demand for lowacrylamide biotech potatoes over conventional potatoes. Some demographics variables across the potato WTP results are significant. Prior knowledge of biotech products increases WTP differences by $0.49-$0.52 (Models 1a and 1b), whereas prior knowledge of non-biotech products reduces the WTP difference by $0.44-$0.49 (Models 2a and 2b). Distance traveled to the experimental site has small but significant effects. Those who exercise at least twice per week experience relative reductions of $0.46-$0.56 in WTP for potatoes after the information treatments. It is difficult to determine the sources of these demographic effects on WTP differences. 28 Demographics play a mediating role, but information treatments are the most substantial determinants of WTP differences. Regression results for WTP differences in French fries, displayed in Table 3.5, are comparable to those of potatoes. Information impacts are large, relative to the $2.25-$2.30 average WTP levels for conventional and biotech French fries. Most treatment effects are significant at the 1% level. Effects from the combined industry and environmental information treatments are now significant at the 5% level, though. Again relative to the environmental group treatment, subjects receiving the industry perspective have WTP $0.81 higher in the second round of bidding, while WTP is $1.46 higher after receiving the scientific perspective. For those receiving both perspectives, the relative impact is $1.63, again higher than the treatment effect from a single statement. This suggests that receiving both information perspectives may have an additive effect relative to the single perspectives. Table 3.7 explores the extent to which the sum of the industry-only and scientific-only information coefficients approximates the impact of receiving both statements (discussed below). WTP for French fries is pulled in the direction of the scientific perspective when subjects receive both industry and scientific perspectives. As in the potato results, when subjects receive the environmental perspective and another perspective, the information impacts are lower than if the subject had received a single non-environmental-group perspective. For example, there is a relative WTP effect of $0.64 for those getting the industry and environmental perspective, a drop of $0.17 from the industry-only impact of $0.81. Estimated treatment effects are similar after dropping insignificant regressors. Regressions (4a) and (4b), which explain the difference in WTP for biotech French fries post-information and conventional French fries pre-information, give similar results. One major difference is that the industry-only perspective effects increase by $0.18-$0.20 relative to their impacts on WTP differences for biotech French fries (columns 3a and 3b). The implication is that consumers may be more sensitive to industry information, such as standard advertising campaigns, when switching from conventional fries to the low-acrylamide fries. The other treatment effects resemble those of the previous model. Specifically, pairings of industry and scientific information have larger impacts ($1.49-$1.54) than the individual statements, and pairings of information involving the environmental statement have smaller impacts than the single statement. Given that potatoes are a staple vegetable of the American diet, whereas French fries are perceived to be a less healthy food, the complementary findings are surprising. Analogous information impacts are useful for industry and public health agencies and suggest that, with respect to treatment effects, consumers view fresh potatoes and frozen French fries somewhat similarly. Other distinguishing features of Table 3.5 are the significant health and demographics variables. WTP differences in biotech French fries are increasing in annual per-person income up to $90,000-$130,000, depending on model (3a) or (3b). The impact of perperson income is small, at roughly 1.2-2.0 cents per thousand dollars of income (evaluated at the sample mean). Further, those with prior knowledge of non-biotech products have reduced WTP of $0.37-$0.43 for biotech fries relative to conventional fries after receiving information. One explanation is that those with superior prior knowledge of non-biotech products may prefer \"natural\" products or have a strong aversion to biotech foods, thus driving down their WTP for biotech foods. Lastly, the number of adults in the household has positive significant effects (models 3a and 3b), and there are substantial downward effects on WTP for those who regularly exercise. The analysis of potato chips WTP differences is given in Table 3.6. Compared to average WTP of $1.99 for both the conventional and biotech potato chips, the information effects are relatively small. Treatment effects for combinations of the industry and environmental perspective and scientific and environmental perspective are significant at the 5% and 10% levels. Across the four specifications, the relative effect of the industryonly perspective is to increase WTP by $0.55-$0.70. These are one-half the size of the scientific-only perspective effects, $1.14-$1.30. The combined effect of both perspectives is an increase in WTP by $1.22-$1.30, although for model (5b), the combined-perspective effect seems to be an average of the two single-perspective effects. We again confirm the finding that joining the environmental group perspective with either of the other two perspectives produces smaller relative WTP impacts. As with the other regressions, our specifications outperform empty models (as indicated by the likelihood ratio test statistics). Subject characteristics have much more influence on WTP differences for potato chips than the other two commodities. WTP differences in potato chips increase with age up to 35-42 years and then decline. At the mean sample age, an additional year reduces the WTP difference by 0.2-1.6 cents. There is a similar concave relationship in per-person income. Beyond $70,000-$90,000, an additional thousand dollars of per-person income has small negative WTP effects. An additional adult in the household has a $0.25-$0.35 impact. In the context of switching from conventional to low-acrylamide potato chips, an increase in the number of adult consumers could be interpreted as a demand increase, thus driving up WTP. Surprisingly, there is little WTP effect among those who read labels or have prior knowledge of biotech and non-biotech foods. However, those who exercise regularly have decreased WTP by $0.32-$0.33 after receiving random information treatments. Why is the WTP difference for biotech potato chips and the low-acrylamide premium relatively less responsive to information effects? A definitive answer requires further analysis, but several explanations are possible. Compared to potatoes and some frozen French fries, potato chips are usually highly processed food items with little nutritional value. Yet they are a common part of the US diet for which some consumers may have strong preferences. Many consumers may want to maintain consumption despite learning about possible negative health consequences. Thus, a persistent consumption \"habit\" could lead subjects to discount the information treatments. Another explanation is that subjects form various beliefs about acrylamide content of food after reading the information treatments. If subjects believe potato chips have very low concentrations of acrylamide relative to potatoes and frozen French fries, it could be rational for them to discount the information treatments, with little influence on valuations. Subsequent analysis could use data on household stocks, purchases, and consumption of potato chips to test the first claim. Our preferred set of information treatment effects are from the reduced models for the biotech commodity WTP differences, i.e., the second columns of Tables 3.4-3.6. Figure   ?? summarizes these effects. Comparisons across commodities are complicated by differences in product sizes and potato content. However, the same relative patterns emerge in all commodities. First, industry perspective effects are roughly half the size of those for the scientific perspective, the perspective with the largest impact. Second, the scientific perspective outweighs the industry perspective in the paired scientific and industry information treatment. Third, the environmental group perspective decreases the effects of the industry-only and scientific-only perspectives. Table 3.7 provides evidence of additive information effects. Using the reduced models corresponding to (1b)-(6b), we test the claim that \u03b2 I +\u03b2 S =\u03b2 SI , where \u03b2 I is the slope on the indicator for the scientific-only treatment, \u03b2 S is the slope on the indicator for the industry-only treatment, and \u03b2 SI is the slope on the indicator for the scientific and industry treatment. Note that, as in Tables 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6, this latter indicator does not account for sequencing effects. Except for equation (1b) explaining WTP differences for biotech potatoes, we cannot reject the null hypothesis at the 1% level that the sum of the industry and scientific effects equals the effect from receiving both perspectives."}, {"section_title": "Information additivity effects", "text": "This additivity feature is well within the range of outcomes implied by the standard errors of the treatments effects. Additivity is not observed for the biotech potatoes (equation 1b) primarily because of the scientific-only perspective's considerable impact. In this instance, the sum of the two single perspective impacts, $3.08, is nearly double the size of the combined-perspective impact, $1.78. If this joint impact represents a weighted average of the two single-perspective impacts, then the potato industry might consider a segmentation approach to marketing. Information that portrays low-acrylamide and biotech food products positively may have more impact for some market segments, while others may be more responsive to the negative health ramifications of acrylamides. The results for the French fries and potato chips, however, recommend a different information strategy. For these commodities, an effective approach would be to combine information perspectives, particularly if marketing costs are subadditive."}, {"section_title": "OLS results ignoring censoring", "text": "As there are fewer than 10% zero bids for any commodity, the OLS results should be comparable. Tables B.1, B.2, and B.3 confirm our expectation. Estimates are very similar to the censored results, though certain OLS slopes are smaller in magnitude. It is well known that OLS results are downward biased when the dependent variable is censored (Amemiya, 1973). This is clearly seen in the information treatment effects. Information effects in the censored regressions for potatoes are $0.05-$0.16 larger than OLS effects. Censored information effects for French fries are $0.01-$0.14 larger. Information effects for chips tend to be $0.01-$0.09 larger than the OLS results, though there are a few instances in which the OLS estimates are marginally larger. Estimates for the demographics, health, children, and experimental design variables are also similar, with the main conclusions remaining unchanged."}, {"section_title": "ID ____________", "text": "Welcome!

Acrylamide is also formed in the baking of bread (crust) and cookies and roasting of coffee beans. \uf0b7 Acrylamide, a chemical compound, is formed in these foods from naturally occurring sugars and asparagine (a building block of a protein). \uf0b7 Compared to other foods in the American diet, French fries and potato chips are a major source of acrylamide. \uf0b7 The amount of acrylamide increases with longer frying or baking times and higher cooking temperatures. However, boiling, steaming, and microwaving potatoes produces negligible acrylamide. \uf0b7 Under Proposition 65, California requires certain restaurants, including Applebee's, Chili's, McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, and KFC, to post a warning stating that \"cooked potatoes that have been browned, such as French fries, hash browns and baked potatoes, contain acrylamide, a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer.\" \uf0b7 However, the FDA has not advised people to stop eating these potato products."}, {"section_title": "Nutrition and Health:", "text": "\uf0b7 The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) designates acrylamide as a \"probable human carcinogen,\" and the US National Toxicology Program classifies acrylamide as \"reasonably anticipated\" to be capable of causing cancer in humans. \uf0b7 The first health studies of acrylamide occurred in the 1960s and explored health hazards with onthe-job contact. Chronic exposure produces toxicity that weakens muscles and reflexes and leads to sensory loss. \uf0b7 Evidence from studies in the 1970s and 1980s advanced the linkages between cancer and acrylamide. \uf0b7 In a recent study, lab animals that consumed low doses of acrylamide placed in drinking water over a long period of time (roughly equal to annual acrylamide consumption of an adult) experienced gene damage. \uf0b7 Another study found that humans who consumed conventional potato chips daily for four weeks had higher incidence of early development of cardio-vascular diseases. \uf0b7 Additional studies suggest linkages between high acrylamide diets and development of breast cancer. High levels of acrylamide consumption by pregnant women have been associated with increased frequency of low birth weight babies.\n\uf0b7 Long-term, low-level intake of acrylamide by lab animals has been shown to create serious health problems.

In well-functioning land markets, these transitions reflect an array of local economic factors, including changes in production environments and climatic conditions. Changes in production environments (e.g., resource endowments, improvements in bio-and information technologies, and management practices) can substantially alter firm productivity and profitability. Weather is a classic example of a stochastic input with interactive and nonlinear impacts on agricultural and resource-based production. As Earth heads toward temperature increases of 1.5 \u2022 C by 2100 (relative to 1850-1900), climate models predict warmer and more frequent hot days, warmer and fewer cold days, expansions in drought-prone areas, and increases in heavy precipitation (IPCC, 2013;. It is poorly understood how US farms and other agricultural firms will mitigate or adapt to climate change by 2100, as perhaps important future policies and technologies have not yet been engineered. However, nearterm adaptation can be more reliably estimated from current behavior. Many climate adaptation strategies exist for US farms (Ortiz-Bobea and Just, 2013). In the short run, firms can adjust quantities and timing of irrigation water, fertilizer, and pesticides, plant earlier in the season or adjust acreage allocations, and adopt drought-tolerant seeds or no-till production practices. In the long run, land can be substituted towards less water-intensive crops, retired from production, or relocated to less impacted or favorably impacted regions. Future adaptation options could include \"prescription agriculture\" (e.g., seeds designed to meet individual operation requirements). Farmers are likely to adjust cropland allocation or crop choice, especially in regions where other adaptation strategies are unavailable or too costly. For example, in response to reduced access to irrigation water, farmers engaged in irrigated agriculture may need to alter planted acreage, whereas others may switch crops Hendricks and Peterson, 2012). This chapter addresses the following question: how do climate conditions influence farm behavior? To answer this question, we examine the impacts of climate on the choice and acreage allocations of corn, soybeans, winter wheat, and other major crops in the central US. We implement well-known two-step estimation routines on pooled crosssectional field data from seventeen states. In the first step, farmers choose a combination of crop and tillage practices. Our focus on no-till methods is motivated by findings that no-till practices help reduce nitrogen leaching and runoff during heavy rainfall (Rice and Smith, 1984;Dinnes et al., 2002;Shipitalo et al., 2013). In the second step, farmers choose acreage allocations conditional on crop choice. The estimation controls for management practices, regional output and input prices, and county variation in soil characteristics. We find that climate conditions significantly affect choice of crop, tillage, and acreage, and all may be appropriate adaptation strategies depending on economic and soil conditions. The balance of the paper is arranged as follows. The next section briefly surveys recent studies on cropland use and climate, with an emphasis on selection models using farm data. Section 3 describes the basic empirical model. Section 4 explains data sources and construction of variables and presents summary statistics. Section 5 discusses the empirical results and provides implications about near-term climate change. Section 6 concludes. Tables of econometric results are contained at the end. Appendix C contains checks on robustness to two econometric issues discussed in the analysis."}, {"section_title": "Empirical model", "text": "The two-step estimation procedure used to correct for selection in the acreage equations is the discrete-continuous framework of Dubin and McFadden (1984). This is a well-known selection correction technique and is more robust and general than the Lee (1983) approach. Despite potential problems arising from multicollinearity between regressors and selection terms, the Dubin and McFadden (1984) method requires fewer assumptions and can provide adequate correction when the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) assumption does not hold (Bourguignon et al., 2007;Schmertmann, 1994)."}, {"section_title": "Discrete-continuous model", "text": "Following the notation of Bourguignon et al. (2007), assume that agricultural producer i maximizes latent economic net returns per field by choosing crop-tillage combination c and then planted acreage, A c . Farm accounting profits are observable but economic net returns per field are latent. For example, we do not observer farmers' opportunity costs or complete measures of human capital. These partially motivate the econometric error, which is assumed to be uncorrelated with explanatory variables of crop-tillage choice. However, unobservables influencing crop choice are assumed to influence planted acreage. Significance of the selection correction terms in the acreage equations is discussed in the fifth section. For choice c \u2208 C crop-tillage combinations, producer i receives latent economic net returns: In the above equation, z ic is a vector of observable variables, \u03b7 ic is an unobserved disturbance, and the analyst observes \u03a0 ic = 1 if c is chosen (and zero otherwise). After selection, the producer's crop acreage decision (conditional input demand) is: where Crop-tillage combination c is chosen if it yields the highest latent economic net returns on the field: Assuming that \u03b7 ic is distributed type I extreme value, the discrete choice problem implies a multinomial logit model (McFadden, 1973). The probability that the condition in (4.3) holds is: . (4.4) Dubin and McFadden (1984) impose the assumption that the conditional expectation E(u c |\u03b7 c , . . . , \u03b7 C ) is linear in (\u03b7 ij \u2212 E(\u03b7 ij )), which further restricts distributional forms for u c . Correcting for selection, equation (42) for the i th observation becomes: where r ic = corr(u ic , \u03b7 ij ) and w ic is an independent error. See Bourguignon et al. (2007) for more details. As pointed out by Mansur et al. (2008), the correction terms in the above equation provide some economic insight. Particularly, the correction term for crop-tillage combination j in equation c measures the impact on acreage of crop c for those farmers predicted to have selected j on a particular field. For example, if there is a statistically significant and positive correction term for no-till soybeans in the OLS regression of no-till corn acreage, then fields planted to no-till soybeans are predicted to be positively associated with no-till corn acreage."}, {"section_title": "Identification", "text": "For identification of Equations 4.1 and 4.5, we impose the following two assumptions. First, we assume that crop rotation history affects the discrete crop-tillage choice but not planted acreage. Although the model is identified without such restrictions, we follow the literature and include a larger set of regressors in the first step than in the second step. Second, we only observe field planted acreage in survey years and not for the full croptillage choice history. Thus, we assume that the acreage of the (randomly-surveyed) field in a particular years equals its acreage planted to other crops in past years. For example, if a randomly-selected field has a rotation history of corn-soybeans-corn in 2008, 2009, and 2010 with a 2010 planted corn allocation of 50 acres, then we assume this field had 50 acres planted to soybeans in 2009 and 50 acres planted to corn in 2008. To obtain consistent estimates, any change in a farmer's field size over time in the sample should be random and absorbed by the econometric error in a way that does not induce correlation with the regressors. This is likely an innocuous assumption for two reasons. First, field sizes are generally predetermined and often have one or more natural or physical boundaries, e.g., creeks, streams, or county roads. Many fields on Midwest farms were originally fenced to accommodate livestock in an era in which combined livestock and crop operations were much more common. Second, the mean number of repeat years per field is 3 in the spring dataset and 1.5 in the fall dataset. Any change in the size of the randomly-selected field would have had to be made over a very short period and would likely not vary with changes in climate conditions, soil characteristics, or prices. As with nearly all other studies in this literature, we abstract from field-level economies of density. Spatial contiguity of fields can produce economies of density because of reduced drive time and reduced capital configuration costs across non-adjacent fields (Holmes and Lee, 2012). Our data contain information only on a single randomly-selected field per farm. Randomization of fields is beneficial because farmers' selection into groups of fields can be safely omitted, unlike studies with data on all fields in each farm. Moreover, modern farmers are much more likely to operate one or more non-adjacent fields located several miles apart. Field studies that estimate spatial correlations and economies of density must control for farm/operation switches in the cross section. Otherwise, spatial economies may be confounded by a specific farm's management practices varying over both adjacent and non-adjacent fields. Given the lack of clean evidence, interactions among fields seem second order in nature for our estimates of the relationship between climate, crop-tillage selection, and land allocation. In the following econometric analysis, Equations "}, {"section_title": "Compilation and construction", "text": "ARMS is a key source of information about agricultural production, management practices, financial conditions, and household attributes of US farms. In its current format since 1996, it dates back to earlier surveys starting in 1975 regarding farm costs and returns, chemical use, and cropping practices. The survey occurs over three phases in a crop year, with stratified sampling over two mutually exclusive frames: a list frame of farms with certain production aspects and an area frame that randomly samples land segments. Sets of thirty replicate weights are constructed in each survey year so that analyses can \"extend\" the observations to the population. Field weights are designed so that field data represent the population of all fields of a certain crop in a certain year. Farm weights are designed so that farm data represent the population of all farms growing the crop(s) of interest in the survey year (ERS, 2013). We do not perform a weighted analysis because we pool data over multiple years and crops. Field data for seventeen states are taken from the 2009, 2010, and 2012 ARMS Phase II Production Practices and Costs surveys. 1 We consider cross-sectional data in these three surveys because they are the most recent years available with extensive information on crop rotation and tillage practices. Importantly, the ARMS enumerators randomly select a field from the farmer's set of fields, which alleviates concerns about systematically productive or unproductive fields entering the sample. We use the following field information from the ARMS surveys: crop choice, planted acreage, use of no-till practices, years of experience operating the field, and whether or not any portion of the field is \"highly erodible\" or contains a  Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin. These states are generally the most productive regions in the US for corn, soybeans, and winter wheat. 2 Rotation controls do not cause endogeneity bias in logit models because the errors are assumed to be serially independent (Train, 2009). data for grids of size 4km x 4km . We construct county weather data as the mean of weather variables in all grid points in the county. Weather data are then averaged over the previous 25 years to construct the climate variables in our analysis. Growing Degree Days (GDD) are a measure of beneficial exposure to sunlight. We use the Snyder (1985)   . To control for these important effects, we define intense precipitation as an instance in which a grid receives an inch or more of precipitation per day. Monthly intense precipitation is the count of such events throughout the month, again averaged over the previous 25 years. Following much of the land-use change literature, we control for time-invariant geologic and hydrologic factors in soils that contribute to soil productivity. Soil structure and land characteristics have significant bearing on land use and allocation. Significance of these factors for agricultural decision making may increase with an evolving climate. Soils data are from the most recent version of the Soil Survey Geographic database (SSURGO), which comprises data collected by the National Cooperative Soil Survey over the century (USDA-NRCS, 2013). Spatial areas of analysis are in \"map unit polygons,\" with states being comprised of hundreds of thousands or millions of soil polygons. To get county-level measures of soil attributes, we include all polygons within a county and weight according to each polygon's area. For certain soil features, data are reported at multiple soil layers (depths) within a polygon, and we compute a simple average over these layers. 3 We use a variety of soil controls as there are no definitive guidelines on the economic importance of specific soil characteristics (National Soil Survey Center, 2014;Earth Systems Modeling Group, 2014). Slope measures the difference in elevation between two points relative to the distance between these points. Regarding soil texture, the percentage of silt and clay are included to capture substantial qualitative aspects of soils. Closely related to these innate soil characteristics are saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), root zone available water storage (AWS), and the K Factor and T Factor. The first variable relates to permeability and measures the soil's ability to transfer water. Root zone AWS is the volume of water that a soil can store in the root zone for plant use. The K Factor is one of several factors used in the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and indicates vulnerability of soils to water erosion. The T Factor, soil loss tolerance, measures the maximum amount of soil erosion that maintains viability of plant growth. Root zone depth is the depth of the soil used by plants to obtain water and nutrients. Organic matter is residue from decomposed plants and animals and is a source of nitrogen and other nutrients (Soil Survey Division Staff, 1993). We also include total county cropland so that regression estimates may be interpreted as holding county cropland fixed. 4 State-level expected prices for corn, soybeans, and winter wheat are calculated according to the methods of (Barr et al., 2011). For corn and soybeans, we first average the daily February close prices of the December corn futures contract and November soybean futures contract traded on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). Next, basis (the difference between the cash and futures price) is subtracted from these February averages. To calculate basis, we first average the daily November and December close prices for the harvest time soybean and corn contracts. From this, we subtract state-level corn and soybean prices received by farmers in the marketing year (cash prices), pub-lished by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). By accounting for basis, we eliminate possible bias from systematic differences between spot and futures prices. To derive expected prices for winter wheat, we start with the average of February daily closing prices for the July Kansas City Board of Trade (KCBT) wheat contract. Basis is calculated similarly, except the harvest-time contract is July. Expected prices are used in the analysis of the spring data. However, we use prices received by farmers in the previous marketing year in the fall data. These prices may more closely match the timing of fall planting decisions. State-level nitrogen prices are calculated from multi-state NASS nitrogen data. Each state is assigned to a multi-state region. We then take a simple average of all reported prices of nitrogen fertilizers and solutions, including anhydrous ammonia. All output and input prices are calculated in 2009 dollars. Prices are deflated to the state level using a price index constructed from gross state product data obtained from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Table 4.1 contains summary statistics on the number of observations in each croptillage combination, decomposed by the spring and fall data. The 16,415 spring field-year observations are obtained from 5,422 unique farms across the seventeen-state sample during years 2006-2012. Tilled corn is the most frequently chosen crop, representing 31% of the spring sample. The next largest category, tilled soybeans, comprises 22% of the sample. The shares of no-till corn and soybeans are 13% and 18%, respectively. The smaller proportion of no-till crops is expected since its adoption has only become more widespread in recent decades. The remaining 16% of crops are categorized as \"other spring crops\" and are not broken down by tillage practice. 5 The 2,137 field-year observations 5 For the spring and fall datasets, the \"other crop\" category contains fields planted to the following: barley, canola, clover, cotton (upland and Pima), dry beans and peas, grasses (other than clover), hay (alfalfa and other), mustard seed, oats, peanuts, potatoes (including sweet potatoes), rice, rye, tobacco (burley and flue cured), safflower, sorghum (for grain and silage), sugarbeets, sunflowers, vegetables, and wheat (Durum and other spring wheat). Cotton, hay, and spring wheat have among the most observations in the \"other\" category. We drop fields that are fallow or are placed in the Conservation Reserve Program. See Appendix C for robustness to the inclusion of fields that are not planted."}, {"section_title": "Summary statistics", "text": "in the fall during years 2006-2011 are from 1,143 farms. Of these farms, 82% are also represented in the spring data. Fall fields are somewhat more equitably partitioned across categories. The share of tilled winter wheat is 39%, while the share of no-till winter wheat is 25%. The remaining 36% are \"other fall crops.\" Table 4.2 contains summary statistics (means) of acreage dependent variables used in the acreage (second-step) regressions. No-till corn fields average six acres larger than tilled corn fields, but no-till soybean fields are three acres smaller than their tilled counterpart. Average tilled winter wheat fields are 10 acres larger than no-till winter wheat fields. Tilled winter fields may be larger because of lower adoption rates of no-till among relatively large wheat farms in the southern Great Plains. Though there is no difference in size between tilled and no-till other fall crop fields, no-till other spring crop fields are 52 acres larger on average than tilled other spring crop fields. This is a result of few observations (e.g., 838 observations) of no-tilled other crops. This partially motives our choice of aggregation across all other crops without regard to tillage practices. Summary statistics of regressors used in the spring analysis are given in Table 4.3. Average climate conditions and variability are similar to climate regressors used in related agriculture-climate studies. For example, monthly GDD range from 249 to 467 across the growing season, with a standard deviation of roughly 60 GDD. Extreme heat, as captured by monthly HDD variables, is less widespread and less frequently-occurring. Monthly HDD range from 0.03 in May to 1.20 in July. Precipitation averages approximately three inches each month in the growing season, though there is substantial variability across counties and time periods. Intense precipitation occurs more often in the early season, with 0.63-0.73 days in the month experiencing at least one inch of 24-hour rainfall. The economic and management variables also convey adequate sample variation. Expected corn and soybeans prices are $4.66/bu and $10.56/bu, with standard deviations of $1.07 and $2.76. Nitrogen prices average $0.22/lb and have somewhat lower variability over years in the sample. Nearly half of the field-year observations have corn planted the previous spring, while roughly one-third have soybeans planted the previous spring. Double-cropping occurs in 14% of the sample. The soil controls suggest that soil and land characteristics are beneficial for corn and soybean farming. Fields that are highly erodible comprise less than 12% of the sample, and 4% of field-years are located on wetlands. This is consistent with a relatively low county average T factor of 1.73. Average root zone depth is roughly four feet (123 cm), with roots capable of accessing water available to 8.5 inches (214 mm). Saturated hydraulic conductivity (a measure of water flow and infiltration) and the K Factor (a measure of soil erosion and runoff rates) are relatively low. County-level organic matter content averages 1.3% by weight, and total county cropland averages 229,000 acres. Summary statistics for the fall data are similar to those of the spring data (Table   4.4). Fall GDD and HDD are relatively low because of cool temperatures in September and October. Mean precipitation in the fall is 0.9-1.2 inches lower than in the spring, but intense precipitation has a similarly narrow range of 0.55-0.85 days per month across the winter wheat growing season. Average previous year output prices are roughly one dollar less than expected prices because they include relatively low prices for year 2005 and omit relatively high 2012 prices. Double-cropping is done on 67% of fall field-years, a consequence of a reduced sample size with emphasis on winter wheat. There are no major differences in soil and land characteristics between the spring and fall data."}, {"section_title": "Spring crop choice", "text": "The large negative coefficient on July precipitation for tilled corn is not surprising given our sample includes farms in areas suffering drought in recent years. However, this is offset by a positive 11-percentage-point August precipitation effect on tilled corn. August precipitation tends to increase corn selection and decrease soybeans selection, perhaps a reflection that farmers prefer soybean crops to be dry by a relatively earlier harvest time. Though several monthly intense precipitation variables are insignificant, the sign pattern of significant variables suggests interesting potential adaptation behavior. An increase by one day in May in which daily precipitation exceeds one inch decreases the probability of choosing tilled corn and tilled soybeans by three to seven percentage points.  Table 4.9 confirms that these intense precipitation effects are significant. The statistic from a Wald test of the null hypothesis that the difference in coefficients on May intense precipitation for no-till and tilled corn crop choice equals zero is 12.43, significant at the 1% level. A similar test of equality of the July intense precipitation coefficients between tilled and no-till corn is also rejected. However, these tests are not rejected for any of the monthly intense precipitation variables in the choice of tilled and no-till soybeans. The combined evidence from Tables 4.5 and 4.9 suggest that switching from tilled to no-till corn or corn to soybeans may be important factors to consider when evaluating farm-level climate adaptation. The signs and magnitudes of the economic and management marginal effects in Table   4.5 generally agree with intuition. Corn and soybeans have own-expected price effects of two and four-to-seven percentage points, respectively. The cross-price effect of soybeans on corn, -0.04, is smaller than the cross-price effect of corn on soybeans, [-0.07, -0.09  Selection correction terms for crop choice appear at the bottom of Table 4.6 and are denoted as S \u2212j 1 , S \u2212j 2 , S \u2212j 3 , and S \u2212j 4 . Application of the discrete-continuous model is supported by nine out of 20 selection terms being significant. 8 The sign pattern of the significant terms is expected. For example, fields that would have been planted to no-till corn but are instead planted to tilled corn have increased acreage (S \u2212j 1 in column 1). 9 Similarly, fields that are \"selected\" for no-till soybeans are positively associated with tilled soybean acreage. This is intuitive given that the choice of no-till or conventional tillage practices for a particular crop in our choice set can be adjusted prior to planting. Further, there is a negative correlation between selection into tilled soybeans and tilled corn acreage (S \u2212j 2 in column 1) and selection into tilled corn and tilled soybean acres (S \u2212j 1 in column 3). The results suggest that choice of crop, tillage, and acreage are highly interrelated and should be carefully considered in future analyses of farm adaptation to climate change."}, {"section_title": "Fall crop choice", "text": "Crop choice of tilled and no-till winter wheat and other fall crops are less influenced by climate conditions (Table 4.7). This is likely a consequence of environmental and economic factors associated with winter wheat farming, rather than inadequate model performance. 10 Similar to spring crop choice, many of the monthly GDD variables are significant. April GDD have a small positive effect on the choice of no-till wheat, but May GDD have negative effects for both wheat categories. Favorable May GDD pull crop choice away from winter wheat towards higher-value crops, consistent with the nearly onepercentage-point effect on \"other\" crops. To the extent that no-till practices somewhat decrease soil temperature, tilled winter wheat may benefit relatively more from GDD in cooler months. 8 In a discrete-continuous study of fuel choice, Mansur et al. (2008) find that 40% of selection terms are significant in regression equations explaining residential fuel use. 9 Selection terms for each crop except the acreage of the crop under consideration enter each regression equation. For example, in the first column of Table 4.6, S \u2212j1 is the selection term for no-till corn, S \u2212j2 is the selection term for tilled soybeans, S \u2212j3 is the selection term for no-till soybeans, and S \u2212j4 is the selection term for other crops. In the second column, S \u2212j1 is the selection term for tilled corn, S \u2212j2 is the selection term for tilled soybeans, S \u2212j3 is the selection term for no-till soybeans, and S \u2212j4 is the selection term for other crops. This notational convention also applies to the third and fourth columns. 10 The value of the converged log-likelihood is -1,768, with an associated pseudo-R 2 of 0.23. A likelihood ratio test of the null hypothesis that the coefficients are jointly zero is rejected at the 1% significance level. The \u03c7 2 70 test statistic is 1,085 compared to the critical value of 100.43. Extreme heat and mean and intense precipitation have little influence on fall croptillage choices. The implausible coefficient on April HDD for no-till winter wheat reflects very little variation in April HDD (see Table 4.4). Mean September precipitation decreases the no-till winter wheat choice by eight percentage points. The negative marginal effect of October intense precipitation is twice the size of the mean September precipitation effect. From Table 4.9, we find that Wald tests of the equality of monthly intense precipitation coefficients between tilled and no-till wheat cannot be rejected at the 10% significance level. 11 The results confirm that winter wheat crop choice is largely unresponsive to climate, perhaps a partial consequence of breeding for suitability in North American production environments (Olmstead and Rhode, 2011). Given winter wheat's relatively better performance in hotter and drier conditions, it may become more widelygrown in the long run under severe climate change (Hornbeck and Keskin, 2014). Fall crop choice tends to be more responsive to management practices and soil characteristics than output and input prices. Corn prices in the previous year have a negative five-percentage-point effect on tilled wheat, but there is a positive own-price effect of similar magnitude on no-till wheat. In general, analysis of output prices must consider dynamic effects (Orazem and Miranowski, 1994). For example, if current nitrogen prices are high and next season's corn prices are expected to be high, then the farmer is more likely to plant soybeans (all other things equal). These factors could further influence rotations of wheat, corn, and soybeans or corn and multi-year hay. Unlike corn and soybean fields, winter wheat fields are more likely to be doublecropped by operators with more years of field experience. The latter effect could be associated with increasing winter wheat farm sizes accommodated by somewhat greater availability of cropland in regions where winter wheat is concentrated. Lastly, the choice of winter wheat is decreasing in land slope and root zone available water storage (not reported in Table 4.7). The fact that winter wheat fields are negatively associated with water storage at the root zone affirms its relevance to climate change adaptation. Holding fixed prices and management practices, winter wheat could be selected on fields increasingly exposed to drought under severe climate change."}, {"section_title": "Conditional fall crop acreage", "text": "These trends are reiterated in the winter wheat acreage results contained in Prices are insignificant predictors of planted acreage, similar to the relatively few significant price effects in the crop choice model. Fields with double-cropped winter wheat tend to be 40 acres smaller, while double-cropped fields planted to other crops tend to be 32 acres larger. Years of field experience exhibit a negative effect of 0.5-1.2 ac/yr and is similar to experience effects on spring crop acres. Selection correction terms are also generally insignificant. However, selection into \"other crops\" is negatively correlated with tilled winter wheat acreage. Intuition for this effect is unclear because of the aggregate nature of the \"other crops\" category. In sum, it is interesting that explanatory measures of winter wheat acreage differ substantially from those for corn and soybeans. Further research on wheat crops and tillage is required for a better understanding of climate change adaptation."}, {"section_title": "Economic implications of farm adaptation to climate change", "text": "The economics of farm and field adaptation to changing climate conditions are poorly understood. Much of the past research has simulated the effects of adverse weather on yields, supply, and prices of major crops. These studies suggest that certain adaptation options could partly alleviate adverse outcomes (e.g., yield losses or decreases in agricultural profitability). In contrast, our results suggest novel econometric relationships between field practices and climate that are consistent with maximizing latent economic net returns. We find that average and intense degree days and precipitation significantly influence field choices of crop, tillage, and acreage. However, adjustment of these optimal choices must account for input and output prices and soil characteristics. Major crops will continue to be corn and soybeans in regions with high net returns to corn (e.g., Iowa, Illinois, southern Minnesota, and north-central Indiana). As occurrences of drought and intense precipitation become more likely over the next decades, our results suggest that farmers may increasingly use alternative field practices, such as no-till or possibly cover crops. Farms may switch from primarily corn and soybeans to winter wheat in drought-prone regions with reduced access to irrigation (e.g., western Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas). In sum, the relative economic importance of adjustments between crop, tillage, and acreage is highly variable. Our results confirm the importance of relative prices, especially for corn and soybeans. The choice of winter wheat and winter wheat acreage are influenced more by economic factors, soil and land characteristics, and lack of irrigation sources than climate conditions. Nitrogen prices create an additional link between optimal choices of crop, tillage, and acreage. Although the relationship between nitrogen prices and climate are less clear, increases in nitrogen prices could favor shifts toward less nitrogen-intensive crops, such as soybeans. This is because soybeans receive lower nitrogen applications and also fix nitrogen."}, {"section_title": "APPENDIX C. CROP CHOICE AND CLUSTERING", "text": "For purposes of analyzing sensitivity to the preferred estimates in Tables 4.5-4.9, we address two conceptual econometric issues. First, the main results drop all field-year observations for which no crop is planted. This is innocuous for the spring analysis as very few random fields in the ARMS surveys happen to not be in use. However, the fall sample size is reduced by several thousand observations as a result of dropping field-years with nothing planted. This also tends to shift the location of the fall analysis away from prime corn-growing areas and precludes discussion of fall cover crop decisions. To analyze sensitivity to this \"control crop,\" we include all observations with nothing planted and add this category to the choice set. Second, the climate regressors, prices, soil characteristics, and cropland controls vary at the county level, despite the field-year dependent variables varying at a much finer spatial resolution. As such, the effective sample size is closer to the total number of counties, and standard errors may be underestimated. The conventional remedy to this potential inference problem is to cluster the standard errors at the highest level of aggregation, i.e., county (Kloek, 1981;Moulton, 1986). Standard errors associated with parameter estimates contained below have been clustered by county. There are 1,123 counties in the spring dataset and 1,120 counties in the fall dataset. Table C.1 provides estimates of the relative-risk ratios for the spring crop choice analysis with clustered standard errors and the additional \"nothing planted\" choice. Because the choice set has expanded by one alternative and the standard errors have been corrected, there are naturally some differences in statistical significance and effect sizes between the results in Tables 4.5 and C.1. Direct comparisons are also difficult because the latter results must be interpreted with respect to the \"other crops\" base category. However, we find that many of the climate coefficients retain significance and the expected sign. For example, July HDD reduce the relative odds of selecting tilled corn and tilled soybeans relative to other crops (0.84 and 0.88), with larger effects on no-till corn and soybeans (0.93 and 0.99). Similarly, May intense precipitation reduces the relative odds of choosing tilled soybeans over other crops (0.83), while there is no significant impact on no-till soybeans. Unlike Table 4.5, climate conditions appear to have similar effects on corn and soybeans because of estimation with respect to the base choice. Patterns among the price effects and management practices are also intuitive and similar to the main results. Expected corn prices have relatively larger effects on choice of corn than choice of soybeans (0.40-0.59 vs. 0.04-0.05), and expected soybean prices have relatively larger effects on choice of soybeans than choice of corn (4.03-4.06 vs. 0.71-0.94). Nitrogen prices are significant but improbably large, perhaps the result of measurement error and small variation in the data. Turning to management practices, we find that fields planted to corn in the previous season are 9.1-13.5 times more likely to be planted to soybeans currently, while fields previously planted to soybeans are 3.4-5.2 times more likely to be planted to corn. Double-cropping also has significant effects. Also similar to the main results, years of field operation are significant but have no practical effect on the choice of any crops relative to other crops. Table C.2 reports the relative-risk ratios for the re-estimated fall crop choice model. As in Table 4.7, many of the climate regressors are insignificant, again suggesting that winter wheat could play an important role under severe climate change. The revised results show that April and October HDD decrease the relative odds of planting tilled winter wheat over other fall crops, in contrast to the main results in Chapter 4. Further, importance shifts from climate conditions to economic factors and management practices for no-till winter wheat. Higher corn and nitrogen prices decrease the relative odds of planting notill winter wheat, but higher winter wheat prices have positive effects on the relative odds of planting both tilled and no-till winter wheat. The impacts of management practices remain similar to those in the main paper. As with Table C.1, our general conclusion is that the fall crop choice results are robust to including the additional \"nothing planted\" category and clustering the standard errors. Of final interest are the effects of climate, prices, management practices, and soil characteristics on the choice to not plant a crop. Both Tables C.1 and C.2 show that this decision is little influenced by any regressors in our analysis. Though several of the regressors in the fifth column of Table C.1 are significant, coefficients in both tables are generally close to one and so have little effect on the relative odds of choosing to plant nothing. This confirms that the \"nothing planted\" choice is economically uninteresting and is reasonably omitted from the analysis in the main paper. However, in upcoming years, the choice to plant nothing in the fall may become increasingly tied to decision making regarding fall cover crops. Future analysis could consider the impacts of expanding current state and federal subsidies of cover crops, with a potentially expanded role for cover crops in farmers' climate change adaptation strategies.  This dissertation explores two distinct but related areas: climate change impacts on components of agricultural supply, and information effects on consumer demand for genetically modified foods. One common thread throughout the three essays is that direct and indirect impacts of poorly-alleviated climate change will differentially affect markets for agricultural products. Estimating the influence of weather and climate on agricultural yields, crop-tillage choices, and land allocation, as well as identifying the role of information and environmental preferences on the demand for GM foods, has been the central focus. Differences between these demand-and supply-side topics necessarily invite distinct methods and data. To address these research questions, we have implemented Bayesian filters, two-step discrete-continuous models, and experimental auctions. The first essay, \"Climate Change, Technology, and US Corn Yields,\" seeks a better understanding of the long-term and short-term implications of climate change for corn, the most important US crop. Increasing yields in the past half-century have contributed to domestic food security, and more recently, created direct links with energy markets. A more complete understanding of the empirical relationship between yields and climate is of practical interest for concerned producers and essential for informed policymaking. Bayesian dynamic regressions are estimated for 770 non-irrigated counties during 1960-2011 and used to forecast corn yields over 2012-2031. Bayesian dynamic econometric models are useful time series methods for addressing structural change, obsolescence of early data, and outliers. For parsimony in out-of-sample forecasts, agricultural production is assumed to be Cobb-Douglas. We find that yields will increase 10-40% over current averages by 2031 for most counties. There is substantial spatial variability in the forecasts, but Corn Belt and Great Lakes counties will experience the greatest yield growth. We then estimate the long-run relationship between climate damages and Hicks-neutral tures. Using experimental methods, we test the effects of food labels and packaged information on willingness-to-pay (WTP) for conventional potatoes and potato products using GM technology to reduce acrylamide levels. Random n th -price auctions elicit WTP before and after each subject receives a randomly-assigned information treatment, consisting of one or two perspectives: an industry perspective on using biotechnology to reduce acrylamide levels, a scientific perspective on exposure to acrylamides, and/or an \"environmental group\" perspective on biotechnology. We find strong information effects: relative to the \"environmental group\" perspective, consumer WTP differences increase significantly for other information treatments. We show for the first time that consumers are willing to pay a premium for food safety obtained using biotechnology for two popular foods in the US diet. These results have practical significance for those interested in food safety and food marketing. The third essay, \"US Climate Change Adaptation along the Intensive and Extensive Margins: A Field-Level Analysis,\" expands on the agriculture-climate links in the first essay by investigating the role of environmental inputs and climate on cropland use and allocation. As farmers respond to climate change, adjustments along both the intensive and extensive margins will be made. A two-step discrete-continuous model of crop-tillage combinations and acreage allocation is estimated using field data from the Agricultural Resource and Management Survey (ARMS). In the first step, a multinomial logit model is estimated to analyze the extensive margin. Farmers choose combinations of crops (corn, soybeans, winter wheat, and other) and tillage to maximize latent economic net returns. In the second step, linear regressions quantify the impacts of climate, economic factors, management, and soil characteristics on crop acreage. Pooling field data over 2006-2012, we find significant impacts on choice of crop, tillage practices, and acreage. Growing Degree Days in nearly all months of the spring and fall growing seasons have substantial effects, as well as mean and intense precipitation. No-till practices may be an effective adaptation strategy to intense heat and precipitation in the short run. In the long run, farmers may adjust crop choice and planted acreage, depending on relative output prices and soil characteristics. Modern agriculture in wealthy countries, such as the United States, is undergoing yet another deep and far-reaching transformation. The duration and expected consequences of this transformation are not known with certainty, but its general effects will be persistent because of sunk investments and limited reversibility. The most important features of this transformation include: (i). climate change and associated threshold effects, (ii). agricultural biotechnologies and the genomic revolution, (iii). site-specific and information technologies drawing on \"big data,\" (iv). pest resistance and its relation to trait licensing, (v). increasing consumer interest in organic agriculture and traceability, (vi). continued market substitution of public R&D for private R&D, (vii). adjustment of producer incentives in new farm policy, and (viii). increasingly mobile agricultural labor supply and production. Although only the first two features have been treated in this dissertation, the analysis can be extended by considering parallels with -and feedback between -these other key aspects. Amid the broader context of this transformation, what are the novel insights and general lessons learned from this analysis? First, deep uncertainty and risk (downside and upside) continue to pervade agricultural adaptation to climate and biotechnologies. The analysis has addressed this with novel applications of appropriate methodologies, producing a more reliable set of results. For example, forecasts of the economic impacts of climate change should not extend beyond reasonable time frames. The accelerating pace of technological innovations suggests that forecasts for year 2100 or beyond have little credibility in practice and limited theoretical purpose. Uncertainty regarding con-sumer demand for biotechnologies is also considerable, but the use of incentive-compatible mechanisms in experiments credibly reduces this uncertainty while retaining external validity. In the longer timer, greater flexibility in modeling and methods will permit better adjustment to the changing set of climate and biotechnology factors deemed important. Second, expanded and up-to-date information sets have become more important for optimal decision making. In the context of climate change, a first step to adaptation is the recognition of fundamentally shifting growing conditions. Continued success of modern agriculture will require eroding a major asymmetry: high acceptance of biotechnologies among producers and climate change among consumers, and relatively lower acceptance of climate change among producers and biotechnologies among consumers. A key lesson from this analysis is that information provision has substantial impacts on consumer (and producer) economic behavior. Such information provision can be accommodated by both private-and public-sector \"nudges.\" For example, notifying producers about average regional nitrogen use or informing consumers about peers' purchases of GM foods are low-cost tools that may help improve social welfare. Third, the evolving structure of incentives is helping to accommodate many of the ongoing changes in US agriculture and food systems. Farmers adopt biotechnologies because they increase yields and decrease certain production costs. Given appropriate incentives, farmers will also respond to either the direct or indirect climate change impacts that affect their operations. In the near term, biotechnology-induced decreases in production costs will be reflected in gradually decreasing food prices, spurring greater demanded quantities of GM foods. The evolution of these market incentives hinge on climate uncertainty and adequate diffusion of information. Additional insights into uncertainty and risk, information provision, and incentives beyond those considered in this analysis will help US agriculture meet increasing global demand for feed, fiber, and fuel."}]
