To overcome this hurdle, patients with homogeneous pathologies should be detected as early as possible. The early detection of AD patients using sufficiently tested biomarkers could demonstrate the potential usefulness of combining biomarkers with clinical measures as a diagnostic tool. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for NDs are being incorporated in clinical trials designed with the aim of detecting patients earlier, evaluating target engagement, collecting homogeneous patients, facilitating prevention trials, and testing the potential of surrogate markers relative to clinical measures. In this review we summarize the latest information on CSF biomarkers in NDs, particularly AD and PD, and their use in clinical trials. The large number of issues related to CSF biomarker measurements and applications has resulted in relatively few clinical trials on CSF biomarkers being conducted. However, the available CSF biomarker data obtained in clinical trials support the advantages of incorporating CSF biomarkers in clinical trials, even though the data have mostly been obtained in AD trials.

Therefore, the early diagnosis of NDs, the identification of people with risk factors, and the development of disease-modifying therapies (DMT) are critical to decreasing the socioeconomic burden of NDs. However, the current approaches are not satisfactory for many reasons, including since the diagnosis of ND is conducted using clinical diagnostic criteria (e.g., AD diagnosis by NINCDS-ADRDA criteria) that have a low diagnostic performance. 4, 5 Furthermore, it is widely accepted that the neuropathogenic changes of AD (i.e., amyloid beta deposition and tau pathology) occur at least 20 years before symptom "}, {"section_title": "CSF BIOMARKERS FOR NDs, FOCUSING ON PROTEINOPATHIC MARKERS", "text": "Various NDs are caused by protein misfolding and aggregation, and the commonality of these molecular mechanisms suggests that proteinopathy is involved. For example, a major hypothesis of AD development is that the accumulation and aggregation of amyloid beta1-42 (A\u03b242) induces progressive synaptic and neuronal injury and activates microglia and astrocytes, followed by oxidative stress, widespread neurite dysfunction, and neuronal death. PD is also a proteinopathy, and is caused by the misfolding of proteins including alphasynuclein (\u03b1-syn). These pathogenic proteins accumulate due to imbalance between the production and clearance systems resulting from genetic and/or nongenetic factors. Impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system is an example outcome of the failure to clear pathogenic proteins, followed by the formation, aggregation, and deposition of toxic oligomers intracellularly or extracellularly. 13, 14 These pathogenic mechanisms of proteinopathies might therefore be suitable targets of DMT and for the development of biomarkers. Previous studies of CSF biomarkers of NDs have focused on proteins involved in disease-specific pathogenic processes, although NDs have clinical and/or pathological heterogeneities, and overlapping symptoms or neuropathologies. Based on these elucidated pathogenic mechanisms, numerous candidate DMT that target the pathogenic mechanisms are currently being developed.

Among them, A\u03b242, which is the stickiest fragment, is produced by \u03b2-and \u03b3-secretases. 15 The overproduction of A\u03b242 and/or impairments in A\u03b242 clearance induce(s) the accumulation of A\u03b242, production of toxic oligomeric A\u03b2, and aggregation and deposition in the AP, [16] [17] [18] and these mechanisms are related to the low concentrations of A\u03b242 measured in the CSF of patients with AD. 19, 20 Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) consist of aggregations of the hyperphosphorylated form of the microtubule-associated protein tau that is assembled into paired helical filaments, which causes a loss of microtubulestabilizing functions. Many kinases and phosphatases regulate the levels of tau phosphorylation at multiple serine and threonine residues. Phosphorylated tau (p-tau) is hypothesized to be induced by A\u03b2 toxicity, and increased levels of total tau (t-tau) and p-tau in the CSF are thought to reflect the release of tau-related protein into the extracellular CSF compartment resulting from neuronal death. 21 The total amount of tau in the CSF, which probably reflects the degree of neurodegeneration, is therefore called a state marker rather than a stage marker; an example of the latter is hippocampal atrophy, which indicates how far the neurodegeneration has proceeded. 22, 23 However, the sequential relationship between A\u03b2 accumulation, tau phosphorylation, and neuronal death has not been fully characterized. Together these findings indicate that the pharmacodynamic effects of drugs targeting A\u03b2 deposition or tau phosphorylation may be assessed by measuring the alterations in the levels of CSF of A\u03b2, t-tau, and p-tau, even though the relationship between JCN the therapy-induced alterations in these CSF biomarkers and the clinical outcome is still unknown.\nThe CSF concentration of A\u03b242 is typically lower while those of t-tau and p-tau are typically higher in patients with AD than in healthy elderly subjects. [24] [25] [26] These CSF findings are typically found decades before clinically detectable cognitive dysfunction, accompanying imaging abnormalities [e.g., detection of amyloid deposition by positron-emission tomography (PET)], and even before abnormalities are detected in imaging biomarkers (e.g., hippocampal atrophy or low glucose metabolism). 27 Using the core biomarkers that reflect the combination of low CSF A\u03b2 levels and high CSF t-tau concentrations, patients with AD can be successfully differentiated from healthy elderly subjects with high (>85%) sensitivity and specificity. 28 In addition, combining the core CSF biomarkers with a genetic risk factor (ApoE genotypes; \u03b54 positive vs. negative) can be used to predict the progression of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. 29 However, several challenges restrict the use of core biomarkers as routine clinical laboratory measurements. One is the small amount of qualified data on the measurements of biomarkers, including, but not limited to, probable preanalytical and analytical variability sources of immunoassaybased quantification that influence the measured values. To overcome these challenges, members of the Alzheimer's Biomarkers Standardization Initiative recently performed a standardization study of minimizing sources of preanalytical variability. 30 Immunoassay-based platforms measure CSF concentrations of biomarkers as relative levels of proteins rather than as absolute concentrations, and so they are probably influenced by several factors, including matrix effects. To this end, the Global Consortium for the Standardization of CSF Biomarkers, which is supported by the Alzheimer's Association, set out to develop internationally available certified reference materials and methods in collaboration with the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements and the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry.

In addition to the core CSF biomarkers, several novel biomarkers that reflect AD pathophysiological processes have also been suggested. For example, \u03b2-secretase activity in the CSF and the levels of APP fragments [soluble amyloid precursor protein alpha and beta (sAPP\u03b1 and sAPP\u03b2)], A\u03b2 oligomers, and C-terminal-truncated A\u03b2 species (e.g., A\u03b237, A\u03b238, A\u03b239, A\u03b214, A\u03b215, and A\u03b216) will soon be tested in clinical trials. 31 Moreover, several studies that have measured these additional candidate novel biomarkers for AD used CSF samples from relatively small cohorts of patients whose diagnoses were determined clinically and often found to be inaccurate. Therefore, cross-sectional studies that employ clinical diagnoses should be large enough to compensate for this issue.

Pharmacological DMT have not been developed for AD and PD. Based on the current understanding of the pathophysiology, the discovery of novel therapeutic targets followed by their testing in preclinical studies to demonstrate their safety and effectiveness is required in animal models. The effectiveness or safety of the developed drugs is classically measured in clinical trials of phases 1 to 3, which results in a hugely expensive and lengthy development process. Reducing the failure rate and developmental period are critical to reducing the cost of new drug development. In the development of DMT in patients with NDs, the clinical effectiveness of candidate drugs needs to be determined over many years. Therefore, tools that predict the pharmacodynamic effects on a novel therapeutic target (e.g., phase-0 proof-of-mechanism study) or even the surrogate clinical efficacy will provide huge advantages and facilitate drug development.\ncan be used to evaluate the levels of the intended molecular effects on the target proteins and predict the pharmacodynamic effects of DMT. This has been the main purpose of previous clinical trials designed to include CSF biomarkers. For example, drugs developed for the AD target of A\u03b2-producing enzymes, such as \u03b2-or \u03b3-secretase, are expected to change the levels of proteins for APP metabolism, including A\u03b2 and the soluble APP species.\nof valid CSF biomarkers. This combined with developing genetic markers will require long-term nationwide and global efforts. The worldwide ADNI and PPMI studies are good examples of the efforts being made for AD and PD, respectively. In addition, the mechanisms of neurodegeneration in NDs should be further investigated using appropriate in vitro and animal models.\nIn conclusion, CSF biomarkers are beginning to be incorporated in clinical trials of anti-AD DMT. The current data support the potential for the use of CSF biomarkers in clinical trial design and data interpretation. However, the currently available data were obtained in a very limited field of NDs; that is, AD. In addition, several analytical and clinical issues need to be clarified. It is crucial to discover, develop, and use valid CSF biomarkers in clinical trials because valid disease CSF biomarkers have major advantages over clinical measures for the prediction of disease development and/ or progression.

Genetic (e.g., multiplication or mutation in the SNCA gene) or nongenetic factors (e.g., posttranslational modification) produce \u03b1-syn aggregates that are toxic to mitochondria and other cellular components. 35 Previous studies involving large cohorts found that the levels of \u03b1-syn in the CSF were lower in patients with PD than in controls. [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] However, using only CSF \u03b1-syn is not very helpful for early diagnoses of PD. A particularly interesting finding is that the levels of t-tau and p-tau in the CSF are lower in patients with PD than in controls (but not patients with AD), and the CSF \u03b1-syn levels are significantly correlated with the levels of t-tau and p-tau in the CSF in both healthy controls and patients with PD. 39 The Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study is a 5-year longitudinal observational multicenter study that is evaluating the usefulness of CSF biomarkers-including core AD biomarkers and \u03b1-syn-in predictions of PD progression. 39, 41 When combined with other CSF biomarkers, such as DJ-1, fractalkine, and AD biomarkers, \u03b1-syn may be a useful marker for predicting the progression of PD and/or reflecting the disease severity.\n40,42 DJ-1, which is also known as PARK7, is a redox-sensitive chaperone that senses oxidative stress. Recent large cohort studies have found that the levels of DJ-1 in the CSF are lower in patients with PD than in controls, but the levels were still not useful for making accurate diagnoses. It should be kept in mind that contamination of the CSF with blood (e.g., due to traumatic lumbar puncture) increases the levels of \u03b1-syn and DJ-1; CSF hemoglobin levels are therefore measured in order to exclude contaminated samples. Standardized centrifugation of CSF immediately after performing the lumbar puncture to exclude blood cells from the CSF may help to prevent bias from preanalytical factors. 39, 42, 43 Core AD biomarkers have recently been applied in the early diagnosis and prediction of disease progression of patients with PD.

Rapid cognitive decline in patients with PD is clearly associated with increased costs of care and higher mortality rates, 44, 45 and its detection is critical for effective clinical management. Siderowf et al. 46 reported that the 2-year cognitive decline was more rapid in PD patients with lower levels of A\u03b242, which was also supported by another study. 47 Therefore, the measurement of other biomarkers such as synucleinopathy-related biomarkers might be important for predicting disease progression. Similarly, clinical studies involving large cohorts and including drug-na\u00efve patients with PD, such as the PPMI study, will be warranted for the development of valid biomarkers of PD progression.

To develop DMT targeting pathogenic components, diagnoses that are based on clinical criteria should be assisted by another tool that can stratify patients according to their pathological findings. This approach is likely to reduce the burden of excessive sample sizes that are employed to address the high degree of heterogeneity in study populations. If valid biomarkers that reflect the pathological characteristics of patients are developed, they can be used to filter study patients in the screening process, and they will result in a particular statistical power being possible using a smaller sample. 60 In addition, the slow progression of most NDs can make it difficult to clinically diagnose patients in the very early stage, when the clinical symptoms are not fully exhibited. Therefore, biomarkers will allow for the design of appropriate clinical trials in the early stages of the disease with sufficient statistical power achieved by enrolling homogeneous subjects. For example, core AD CSF biomarkers show sufficient predictive values for the progression of MCI to AD, which indicates the possibility of stratifying between patients with MCI with homogeneous AD pathologies in their brains who will progress to AD and patients with MCI without AD pathology. 61 This patient stratification strategy can also be applied in AD prevention trials; this issue is discussed in more detail in the next session."}, {"section_title": "Examples of anti-AD trials applying CSF biomarkers for sample enrichmentenhancement", "text": "The phase-1 first-in-human trial of GSK933776 (A\u03b2 immunotherapy) only included patients with prodromal or mild AD with AD CSF profiles (low CSF A\u03b242 and high t-tau or p-tau). 62 In a phase-2 trial of avagacestat, the cognitive decline and brain atrophy were more rapid in patients with prodromal or mild AD with AD CSF profiles than in patients without AD CSF profiles, which indicated that utilizing CSF biomarkers can be a useful sample-enrichment strategy in JCN clinical trials. 59 Several ongoing clinical trials have applying biomarker-based inclusion criteria.

All efforts to develop DMT for patients with mild-to-moderate AD have failed, which might have been due to the recruitment only of patients with advanced stages of AD pathologies. 65 This concept encourages the use of CSF biomarkers in prevention clinical trials to test candidate DMT in prodromal and preclinical subjects who will progress to full-blown AD. There are two strategies for using CSF biomarkers in a prevention trial. The first strategy is to use CSF biomarkers as a quantitative measure of pharmacodynamic effects in subjects with genetic risk factors. For example, the phase-2 Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative-Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer's Disease trial [API-ADAD trial (NCT01998841)] for crenezumab (A\u03b2 immunotherapy) and the phase-2/3 API APOE4 trial (NCT02565511) for CAD106 (A\u03b2 immunotherapy) and CNP520 (BACE inhibitor) included PSEN1 E280A carriers and subjects with a homozygous APOE4 genotype, respectively, 66, 67 and incorporated CSF biomarkers such as CSF t-tau or p-tau in the outcome measures. 66 In the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) study, the A\u03b2 and tau pathology was expected to start at least 15-20 years before the clinical symptoms. 7 Based on the findings of the DIAN study, a phase-2/3 trial of the DIAN Trials Unit (NCT 01760005) for gantenerumab and solanezumab included patients with autosomal dominant APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 mutations, and A\u03b242, t-tau, and p-tau levels in the CSF were measured and correlated with imaging biomarkers as an outcome. 68 The second strategy in a prevention trial is to use CSF biomarkers to screen candidates who are likely to progress. For example, the phase-3 Anti-Amyloid treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimers prevention trial (A4 trial) for solanezumab recruited subjects with evidence of an AP burden in their brain identified through either amyloid imaging scanning or CSF A\u03b242 level, and the CSF levels of A\u03b2 and tau were measured as a secondary outcome (NCT02008357). Identifying asymptomatic cognitively normal subjects with AD pathologies is a critical issue for prevention trials, and CSF biomarkers are promising candidates for achieving this. However, sufficient evidence is required that cognitively normal subjects with AD pathologies progress rapidly to MCI and AD compared with subjects without AD pathology. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 3 (ADNI-3) of North America, a project designed to develop CSF biomarkers that support these hypotheses following the results of the previous ADNI-1, ADNI-GO, and ADNI-2 studies, is currently being prepared with the aim of obtaining such evidence.\nPrevention trials of other NDs, including PD, have not been proposed because no valid biomarkers associated with disease progression have been identified yet. Therefore, the development of valid biomarkers, particularly CSF biomarkers, will facilitate prevention trials of candidate drugs that target multiple therapeutic targets of NDs in cooperation with genetic and imaging biomarkers."}, {"section_title": "Challenges in using CSF biomarkers as surrogate endpoints", "text": "A surrogate endpoint is defined as a biomarker that is intended to substitute for a clinical endpoint. 11 In particular, NDs are chronic diseases with a slow progression of irreversible neuronal damage that is followed by clinical manifestations. Surrogate markers therefore have great value in clinical trials, and CSF biomarkers can be considered as potential surrogate endpoints in an anti-AD trial. However, it should be noted that there is little evidence of CSF biomarkers substituting for clinical endpoints, such as the ADAS-cog, or that the magnitude of changes in CSF biomarkers is correlated with the degree of clinical improvement. 69 For example, a phase-3 clinical trial of 18 months of bapineuzumab treatment showed a decrease in the AP burden and CSF p-tau levels, but no clinical benefit. 70 Such a mismatch between biomarker changes and clinical efficacy may be attributable to several factors, including the possible time delay between the change in a biomarker to its effect on the clinical course, and the dosing regimen in a long-term trial being insufficient to ensure clinical improvement. Therefore, data supporting JCN clear correlations of CSF biomarkers with clinical outcomes from longer-term observations are required to clarify whether CSF biomarkers can act as surrogate endpoints. Furthermore, the quantitative relationship between the changes in CSF biomarkers and clinical outcome measures needs to be further defined. To this end, several issues related to the measurement of CSF biomarkers are currently being focused on."}, {"section_title": "CURRENT ISSUES AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES", "text": "The use of CSF biomarkers for the early diagnosis of AD was first proposed more than 2 decades ago, and numerous single-center and multicenter clinical studies have supported the diagnostic potential of CSF biomarkers in AD. The diagnostic criteria for AD have been revised following determinations of successful diagnostic values, although only for research purposes, but including clinical trials. The ADdriven experiences of incorporating CSF biomarkers into clinical trial designs and clinical research will be further extended to other CSF biomarkers and NDs. Global efforts and nationwide clinical research studies have together contributed to the identification of useful AD CSF biomarkers.\nHowever, several issues and limitations remain to be fully resolved. Particularly in clinical trials, appropriate decisionmaking (e.g., go vs. no-go decisions) is essential for successful development, and so data on the definite roles of CSF biomarkers in clinical trials still needs to be acquired. First, the bias in measuring CSF biomarker levels needs to be clearly defined. The measurement of CSF biomarkers in a central laboratory involving experienced specialists and based on reliable data will be appropriate for the application of CSF biomarkers and the interpretation of data from not only clinical trials but also multicenter studies. In addition, a clinical trial that includes CSF biomarkers should consider a \"gray zone\" for the cutoff value of CSF biomarkers (Fig.  3) . Because there are insufficient data from clinical settings for CSF biomarker-based diagnosis, the inevitable bias present when measuring CSF biomarkers will result in the need for upper and lower cutoff values rather than a single cutoff point. Second, the limitation that changes in CSF biomarkers are at best only weakly correlated with quantified clinical measures should be considered. Because NDs progress slowly, clinical trials covering a period of up to 1 year would not be able to clearly demonstrate correlations of the pathological changes in the drug target as quantified by CSF biomarker levels with clinical outcome measures. Instead, longer-term clinical trials involving multiple doses at the early stages of the disease in pathologically homogeneous patients are necessary to obtain further insight into the relationship. Third, the relationships between CSF biomarkers and other biomarkers (e.g., genetic and imaging) should be defined. The application of multiple biomarkers in clinical trials may improve the power of stratification, interpretability of the data, cost-effectiveness, and cooperative effects. For example, the combined application of CSF biomarkers and the APOE genotype in AD will improve patient stratification and data interpretability. Finally, very few CSF biomarkers have been developed for NDs, except for AD. In particular, the mixed pathology of tauopathy and synucleinopathy in several NDs (e.g., PD dementia) may interfere with the validity of using CSF biomarkers in non-AD NDs. Clinical studies involving autopsy-confirmed patients would be a good strategy for speeding up the development Fig. 3 .
