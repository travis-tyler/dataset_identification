Although open admissions policies increase access to college, many students may not really be college students; they are taking noncedit remedial courses, which raises concerns about stigma and \"cooled-out\" aspirations. Studying two comtmunity colleges, this article describes a remedial approach that avoids stigma and cooling out but creates unintended consequences. Analyses of interviews with staff and students and of institutional procedures show how this apptoach arises. The analyses also indicate how this approach inhibits and delays students' awareness of their remedial status, causes them to misjudge their prospects, and prevents them from considering alternative options.\nrue to American ideology, individuals have a say in their attainments, but their goals and efforts usually depend on their perceptions.\nSystematic misperceptions lead to blocked opportunity just as surely as do concrete barriers, and they produce less social protest and more self-blame. Recent studies have examined how individuals perceive the stratification process. O'Connor (1999) described how low-income African American students' perceptions of the mobility process are influenced by societal factors, and Lareau and Horvat (1999) showed how African American parents' suspicion of schools reduces their compliance with school standards of teacher-parent interaction and compromises their ability to advocate for their children. In contrast, some studies have noted the tendency of individuals to have excessive expectations that are unlikely to be realized (Smith and Powell 1990) . This tendency may not be limited to individuals; institutional practices may encourage these misperceptions through distorted or unclear information.\nIt is often difficult to see where social stratification is created in institutions, and the lack of clarity may be an important mechanism for increasing the stability of stratification systems. Stratifying processes may be obfuscated by processes between and within institutions, particularly the classes and symbols that signal distinct tracks and trajectories (Useem 1992) . Lack of clarity can arise between institutions if prior \"feeder\" institutions do not provide key information that would help individuals anticipate the demands of later institutions and how they will be evaluated and stratified within them (Dougherty 1994 ). In addition, within a single institution, information can be controlled so that individuals may have difficulty seeing how and when they are being stratified. As a result, institutional stratification processes that are not clearly seen are not easily confronted. One manifestation of this phenomenon has been noted in community colleges. The term cooling out is used to describe the process by which community colleges urge students to recognize their academic deficiencies and lower their aspirations (Clark 1960; Karabel 1977) . This study found the use of a \"nonstigmatized\" approach not noted by prior researchers that is kinder and gentler. Although the intent of this approach is to avoid communicating low expectations and limiting students' goals, it has some unintended consequences that are less benign, making it even more effective in managing students' perceptions and channeling students into lower-status positions."}, {"section_title": "BACKGROUND", "text": "Although our image of community colleges is still based on research from the 1960s and 1970s, community colleges are dramatically different institutions today. One artifact of open admissions policies has been the enormous growth of remedial programs. In fact, 64 percent of high school students who enroll in community college take some remedial courses (Adelman 1995) . These changes have raised new issues and force us to reconsider our conceptions.\nOne concept that must be reexamined is cooling out. Derived from Goffman's (1952) description of the way confidence men get their victims to come to terms with having been swindled, cooling out may also be used to describe the ways in which community colleges get students to lower their unrealistically high expectations for obtaining bachelor's degrees and to aim for one-or two-year degrees in vocational or applied programs (Clark 1960) . Colleges accomplish this cooling out by a combination of preentrance testing, counseling, orientation classes, notices of unsatisfactory work, further referrals for counseling, and probation. These steps serve to convince students who aspire to transfer to four-year colleges to \"accept their limitations and strive for success in other worthwhile objectives that are within their grasp\" (Clark 1973:367) . Just as the confidence man convinces victims to accept their loss as being in their own best interests,1 colleges convince students that lowered plans are in their own best interests.\nCooling out may still occur today in community colleges. Indeed, it may be happening more, but in addition to the process described by Clark (1960 Clark ( , 1973 , the phenomenon has taken on new and multiple forms. These new processes may have important implications. As we suggest, the primary concerns of the older literature may have been somewhat reduced in recent decades, but there has been a concomitant increased concern about another element.\nThe cooling-out process has been criticized primarily for demoralizing students and lowering their plans. It forces students to lower their expectations by indicating that they cannot meet their aspirations. It does so by subtly and not so subtly stigmatizing students and forcing them to realize their inferiority on the basis of their performance within a \"legitimate\" framework of \"objective\" academic standards. Karabel (1977) criticized cooling out for guiding students-primarily those of working-class or lower middle-class originsinto lower-status tracks. He was especially critical of the role that cooling out plays in actively pressuring students to sort themselves out of the competition for transfer on the basis of their substandard performance. If students do not seek guidance, Karabel (1977:239) stated, \"the counselor with the Deil-Amen and Rosenbaum Sm-R a h him that he \"had his chance\" and did not \"measure up.\" Karabel (1977:240) further noted that \"community colleges . . . developed cooling out as a means not only of allocating people to slots in the occupational structure, but also of legitimating the process [and causing] people to blame themselves rather than the system for their 'failure.\"' By convincing students to see lower-track vocational courses as their best alternative, cooling out gets students to accept the college's assessment as serving their own self-interest (Erickson 1973) .\nIn addition, Dougherty (1994) highlighted the prevalence of community college faculty's low expectations of students and the negative impact they have on students' performance. His analysis drew on research by London (1978) and Weis (1985) , which suggested that community college instructors respond to students' low skill levels by concentrating on a few promising students and largely giving up on the rest. As Dougherty (1994:90-91 ) noted:\nThe sad irony is that these low expectations feed a self-fulfilling prophecy. In a process well described by labeling theorists within the sociology of education, ... low expectations tend to lead teachers to withdraw attention and praise from poorer students, which in turn reinforces the very poverty of the student performance that is being decried.\nA second aspect of cooling out that has been less emphasized is that it delays students' recognition of their situation. As Goffman (1952) observed, after a swindle is completed, delayed recognition is important for giving the victims time to get adjusted to their circumstances. Clark (1973) and Karabel (1977) noted a similar delaying process, but they de-emphasized it because of their focus on the lowering of expectations. Although community college staff are aware of students' poor prospects from the outset, they delay telling students. The process is somewhat deceptive, and purposely so, but it is seen as tactful kindness, a way of giving students time to recognize and adjust to their lower prospects. Students ultimately come to the same negative decision, and it is the negative implication, not the timing, that is the primary concern of critics. After all, what difference does it make if students figure out their situation only a few months later? As Clark and Karabel described, by the end of the first term of college, when they get their first college grades, students have come to a full recognition of their situation.\nHowever, several decades after Clark (1973) and Karabel (1977) wrote about the cooling-out process, we find important changes. First, more high-school students plan to attend college, and many enter who have little likelihood of completing their degrees. The proportion of high school seniors who are planning to get college degrees has increased by almost two thirds over the past two decades (National Center for Education Statistics, NCES, 2000:41) . By 1992, 84 percent of high school seniors in the National Education Longitudinal Study planned to get a college degree (AA or higher), and 68 percent expected to get a BA degree (Schneider and Stevenson 1999) , but less than half these students were likely to complete any degree (Rosenbaum 2001) . These high expectations arise, in part, because many students with college plans think that their school achievement has little effect on their educational attainment (Rosenbaum 1998; Steinberg 1996) . Student know that open admissions will allow them access to college, and they report that they ca wait to exert effort until they get to college (Steinberg 1996) . Unfortunately, for these stu dents, high school grades strongly affect the completion of college degrees. In the Hig School and Beyond study, most seniors wit poor high school grades (Cs or lower) planned to get college degrees, yet such st dents have only a 14 percent chance of doing so by age 28, and almost one-third get no college credits (Rosenbaum 2001). Second, guidance counselors' practice have changed in ways that may furthe increase the burden of cooling out in col leges. High schools have reduced the ratio high school counselors to students (McDonough 1997) , and guidance counselors' practices now favor an approach that does not interfere with students' college Stigma-Free Remediation acted as gatekeepers seve (Cicourel and Kitsuse 1964; Rosenbaum 1976) , more recent research (Rosenbaum, Miller, and Krei 1996) found that high school counselors subscribe to a \"college-for-all\" philosophy and avoid giving students unpleasant news. They advise nearly all students to try out college, even if they expect them to fail. Some counselors confided that they had misgivings about not warning students who had little chance of success, but they reported that parents often complained when they conveyed such warnings, and principals supported the parents.\nThird, community colleges have radically changed higher education-increasing access and offering extensive remediation. They have implemented open admissions policies that allow all students to enter, regardless of qualifications, yet they have constructed remedial programs to provide instruction to students who are not prepared for collegelevel courses. Beginning in the 1960s, colleges, particularly community colleges, devised remedial programs to help students who lacked high school-level skills. The best national estimate of the extent of remedial education came from a careful analysis of college transcripts of a national survey of students of the class of 1982. It found that when they enter college, about 46 percent of students are in remedial courses, and among those who enter community colleges, 64 percent are in remedial courses (Adelman 1995) . Although these individuals seem to be \"college students,\" since they are enrolled in a college, they are actually taking some high school-level (remedial) courses.\nFourth, students who take several remedial courses are not accumulating many college credits, and their chances of completing a degree are lower than are other students'. Yet students do not lower their educational plans.\nTwo studies documented a pattern in which the percentage of students who completed degrees sharply decreased as the number of remedial courses increased (Adelman 1999; Grubb and Kalman 1994) . Yet analyses of national data have found that students' educational plans do not decline with increasing remediation (Deil-Amen 2002 The present study examined the ways in which community colleges handle the information management dilemmas implicit in the current situation. These four conditionshigh school students' college aspirations, college-for-all counseling, the large number of students in remedial courses, and the association between the number of remedial courses and college dropout-create the need for community colleges to deal with students whose circumstances contradict their high expectations.2 In contrast to the cooling-out processes noted in prior research, we found a process not envisioned by the earlier researchers that has reduced some concerns but made others more important. We discovered a \"stigma-free\" approach that is used effectively. Although open admissions has allowed students to enter with lower qualifications than in previous decades, community college staff have found ways to avoid conveying stigma, so students feel more self-confident. We were amazed and favorably impressed by the techniques they used to avoid conveying stigma.\nHowever, our analyses suggest a downside. Although school staff may keep students from feeling demoralized or inferior, they may be preventing students from considering a wider range of options. Just as Goffman's (1952) swindler cools out a victim (\"mark\")\nby delaying recognition and preventing timely constructive activity, nonstigmatized cooling out delays students' recognition, which prevents them from making timely career decisions to pursue other options that may be more constructive for their occupational attainment. While Clark (1973) and Karabel (1977) found relatively brief delays of recognition that they considered of minor harm, we found lengthy delays over several terms of college, which may be more detrimental. In addition, we administered surveys to 804 students at the two colleges that included questions about students' goals, attitudes, experiences, course-taking pattems, and perceptions.4 Data were collected with a primary focus on students in precredit or college creditlevel degree-granting programs. Therefore, our research did not encompass the other offerings of these colleges, such as continuing education, special-interest classes, adult basic education, vocational skills training, English as a Second Language, and preparation for general equivalency diplomas (GEDs)."}, {"section_title": "INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT", "text": "Our research revealed a combination of institutional characteristics that create the groundwork for the type of stigma-free approach mentioned earlier. In this section, we detail this institutional context, which underpins the stigma-free approach, and in the next section, we discuss the approach itself. The main elements of this institutional context are a strong emphasis on transferring to four-year colleges, a developmental approach to remediation, and a strong social mission."}, {"section_title": "Strong Emphasis on Transfer", "text": "Both colleges are located in an urban multicampus district in Illinois, where the junior college system was founded not long after the turn of the 20th century through the efforts of and pressure from five university presidents who championed the \"definition of the junior college role and function ... as a place of higher education distinguished from the four year college or university only by the brevity not the content or quality of the curricula\" (Dobberstein 1987:16) . In the 1950s and 1960s, as community colleges expanded rapidly across the nation (Brint and Karabel 1989, 1991; Dougherty 1994) , this district experienced an expansion of conventional liberal arts courses and expansion of faculty largely hired directly from graduate schools.\nThese faculty members brought a sense of higher education which reinforced the traditional mission and replicated [the traditional] view of the junior college. As this faculty acquired tenure and developed a strong union, these professors would form the bulk of the instructional staff which is still dominant in the system (Dobberstein 1987:20) .\nThe prevalence of this transfer-oriented junior college model of the community college has persisted in this district, particularly in these two colleges.\nAlthough the two community colleges offer more and larger occupational programs than they did in earlier decades, an emphasis on transferring students to four-year colleges remains central, especially among liberal arts Deil-Amen and Rosenbaum faculty. These colleges may emphasize transfer somewhat more than most community colleges in the nation, but the difference is small: 25.8 percent of the students at these two colleges planned to get BA degrees, compared to 22.9 percent of a national sample of community college students (Deil-Amen, 2002) . Thus, the transfer of students to fouryear colleges is still a major part of the missions of most community colleges.\nMaintaining \"Standards\": A Developmental Approach\nToday, this strong emphasis on transferring students orients the faculty at these colleges toward preparing students to meet the standards and requirements of the senior colleges to which they intend to transfer. This orientation is reflected in the highly complex hierarchy of course levels that are intended to preserve standards and move remedial students into the college-level courses that are accepted for transfer credit by senior institutions. An English professor commented:\nI think almost everybody sees that there is a commitment and dedication to the same type of ideals of helping the students and holding certain standards so that the students are not just passed along. I know in English we talk about it all the time. We do the students no favor to pass them along to the next level when they're not really prepared for it. So there's a lot of that making sure the [students are] academically prepared for the next level even here at the college so that they will then be successful. Because you sort of program them for failure if you're going to let them go on and they don't have the skills necessary.\nIn our interviews, virtually all faculty members vigorously approved of this system because they saw it as giving students a clear and structured pathway into college and providing students with a college education, not a less-than-college education. As a department chair stated:\nWe spend a lot of time talking about how you keep standards up because the last thing this population needs is further fraud perpetrated upon them where they've been told \"OK you've passed\" when, in fact, they haven't mastered what they're going to need to survive out there. And pretty soon someone's gonna throw them out there, and they're gonna sink. And I won't be part of that fraud, and I don't think many of my colleagues will.\nA philosophical approach to remediation that is grounded in developmental (rather than behaviorist) theories of learning fits well with this institutional culture. Rather than the less expensive behaviorist approach, which assumes that students can master subject matter using self-paced, computer-assisted In short, faculty and counselors view their mission as helping remedial students slowly but surely achieve their educational aspirations by guiding them through a series of short-term improvements."}, {"section_title": "Social Mission", "text": "The overall culture at Northwest and Central\nColleges stresses a mission of providing opportunities to disadvantaged students. The faculty we interviewed expressed strong commitments to this role, and many acknowledged that it was a central component of their professional identity. The awarding of \"institutional credit\" for remedial classes is part of that same social mission. Like 80 percent of community colleges nationwide, Central and Northwest Colleges offer institutional credit for remedial classes in reading, writing, and mathematics. Institutional credit counts toward financial aid, campus housing, and full-time student status, but it does not count toward the completion of degrees (NCES 1996) . This status allows remedial students to receive Title IV financial aid, and it SigaFeReeito_25 was opposed by conservatives in Congr who sought to limit Title IV funds to \"t students most able to benefit\" (Day McCabe 1997) , which would have comp remedial students to pay for their own re diation. Giving institutional credit for rem al courses represents a battle won by n conservative forces in their attempt to m tain financial access for disadvantaged dents. The faculty and administrators interviewed expressed sentiments that agr with the position of the American Associa of Community Colleges that \"promo access to higher education, especially for e nomically and socially disadvantaged dents, needs to continue to receive prio consideration, and the investment of p dollars to support this commitment is only essential, but appropriate\" (Day McCabe 1997) .5\nThe faculty and administrators at the co munity colleges we studied thought blaming students for deficiencies in their or financially penalizing them in a way may restrict their access to and hamper t success in college was not compatible w their social mission of opportunity. Simila judging, evaluating, or altering stud long-term aspirations is not part of how c lege staff define their role, especially if s dents aspire to transfer to four-year colle Rather, the counselors and faculty think they should not underestimate the pote for students to turn around and achieve their goals of attaining college degrees despite their histories of poor academic performance.\nAs one department chair noted when asked whether he makes judgments about students who may not complete their degrees, \"Some people are late bloomers. Some people just take a long time to click and get into it.... So I don't make those kind of determinations.\" A counselor at Northwest articulated a similar philosophy:\nYou could easily misjudge or judge too fast an academic history by the fact that they didn't do too well the first couple of times. You'd be surprised. I try to stay away from that. "}, {"section_title": "CONSEQUENCES OF THE NON-STIGMATIC APPROACH", "text": "The faculty's reluctance to make judgme about students' ability to obtain their go and the desire to encourage all students transfer to four-year colleges has led to ne practices. Schools have often been critici for stigmatizing students by placing them remedial programs. In our interviews w community college staff, we were surpri to discover that they had developed inno tive ways to avoid conveying stigma.\nHowever, in interviewing students, we discovered a serious disadvantage to this approach:\nMany students did not recognize their remedial status or realize the crucial implications of that status.\nThe two community colleges offer a large number of remedial classes that do not count as credit toward a degree or transfer. Yet students' own remedial placements and the place of remedial classes within the larger structure of the college are not always clearly stated to the students. The term remedial is rarely used in conversations between staff and students. Instead, the term developmental is usually used. This term accurately reflects the colleges' modes of instruction, yet students do not understand what the word really means. In this institutional context, the term developmental is merely a euphemism for remedial.\nThis euphemistic approach seems highly desirable. It is a form of information management that downplays the negative and highlights the positive aspects of students' placement. It avoids the tendency to blame students for their deficiencies. Realizing that students' low skills may be due to difficult life circumstances or low high school standards, English professor at Northwest explained the logic:\nAs your student population becomes less elite, you can't assume a common background ...\nand if there's not a common background and you have so-so students who are not completely confident of themselves as students, then you're going to have to support them ...\nWe assume we're not getting all the A students [and we're getting students] who aren't confident, and you have to kind of keep them afloat, particularly when it gets to be hard.\nSecond, most faculty and counselors truly believe that remedial placement is preferable to the placement of students in classes for which they are underprepared and in which they are likely to get frustrated and give up. Attempts to improve remedial English classes tend to focus on moving students steadily through a sequence of remedial courses, giving them the opportunity to develop their skills and transition to college-level English. The faculty member in charge of remedial English at Central described the logic:\nWe feel that they get much more out of their experience because it's so connected with what they did the prior semester.... What I'm hoping is that we'll ... work on our curriculum, so that it goes all the way . . . up to English 102 with the same basic aims, the same basic abilities that are being developed at higher and higher levels as the student goes through the curriculum.\nA counselor at Northwest commented on the importance of moving students too quickly into college-level courses that may be too difficult for them to handle:\nThere are a number of [reasons] why students drop out. There's the frustration level. They just give up and walk away.... If students are given the kind of course work or the opportunities to improve certain skills that they are lacking, then we have a better chance.\nFaculty, who view the testing and placement system as legitimate and in the students' own best interest, try to inform students \"gently\" of their remedial placement by construing it as a positive and necessary step toward the fulfillment of the student's ultimate goals. A faculty member who teaches remedial English said this about the way she tries to communicate her remedial program during registration: \"We try to build in that it's a positive experience.\"\nApparently, the efforts of faculty and counselors work as intended: Students do not feel stigmatized or demoralized on learning of their remedial placements. In interviews, students explained their remedial placements by repeating the positive language they heard from college staff. Community colleges convey a stigma-free message: This is a second chance to improve some minor weaknesses and enhance your skills. There is no need to feel bad.\nThis stigma-free technique seems to be an appropriate strategy, given the lack of confidence and fragile academic egos that many students have when they walk through the community college's open door. For instance, when Enrique started, he was concerned because he had been out of school for so long. He actually expected that he would do so poorly that he would get Ds and then have to take his classes over again. However, after getting his placement test scores, he was reassured by his instructor's comments that he was only one level below regular English.\nEnrique said, \"I guess I'm not that bad.\"\nBecause of his positive experience with his current English class, he feels more confident. As Enrique put it:\nI feel more tenacious.... I'm trying to find a word for it. I don't feel that I don't belong The softer approach has clear advantages over a stigmatizing approach that discourages students by labeling them deficient, disregards their ability to improve, and reinforces their doubts about their potential. It is likely to improve morale and the institutional culture and may interrupt the negative cycle of low expectations that exacerbate students' poor academic performance and failure (Dougherty 1994; London 1978; Weis 1985) . Counselors, advisers, and instructors at Central and Northwest Colleges had clearly taken steps to communicate high expectations and minimize negative labeling.\nOn the other hand, a reluctance to use language that may have negative connotations can prevent students from receiving clear information. The vague language used by faculty to soften or avoid the stigma of the students' remedial placements led to confusion, particularly for students who were not familiar with the college environment. Annette, for instance, was not familiar with the system or with test-taking strategies and did not realize that the placement test would determine the type of courses she could take: Annette's misperceptions were cleared up soon after she began taking her classes.\nHowever, many students experience much longer delays of recognition, and their lack of awareness is fostered by the lack of clarity in verbal exchanges, as well as in the written documents available to students."}, {"section_title": "ANALYSIS OF CATALOGS AND COURSE LISTINGS", "text": "The softer approach has even been built into the structure through which these courses are Furthermore, remedial instruction itself is arranged hierarchically, and students are allocated to a place within this hierarchy through their performance on a placement test. However, the hierarchy is difficult to see, and students often fail to recognize their own position within this system. Indeed, the system is not clearly defined. Just as the word remedial is not used in verbal interactions, it also does not appear in catalogs, course descriptions, or class schedules. After extensive effort to analyze the course offerings and interviews with staff about the meaning of certain terms and descriptions, we discerned the main elements of the course hierarchy. For simplicity, we grouped the community colleges' course offerings into four general categories: (1)\"precredit\" remedial, (2)\"college\" remedial, (3)\"ambiguous\" college credit, and (4)\"definite\" college credit.6 We can describe these categories succinctly, but such distinctions are not readily apparent to students. Ambiguity is a major attribute of some of these categories.\nAt the lowest end, there is no ambiguity.\nPrecredit remedial courses are tuition-free and are described in Central's catalog as \"noncredit.\" At Northwest, they are housed in a separate non-college credit division of the college. Students who score below a 10th-grade threshold on the reading, writing, or math placement test are placed in a precredit curriculum at either the 8th-or 9th-grade level. According to Northwest's assistant to the dean of instruction, these students' scores are \"below the required level for college level.\" Northwest's catalog states that precredit students must pass a \"progress test\" to advance to the college's \"collegiate programs\" or \"credit division.\"\nOn the other hand, at the next two levels, Giving remedial classes the status of \"institutional credit\" was intended to prevent barriers to access for underprepared students and prevent remedial students from being segregated from other students. Institutional credit allows students to acquire the skills they lack without requiring the additional financial hardship that would come from denying them federal aid to help pay for these courses. It also allows remedial classes to be included along with the other college credit courses, rather than be segregated into a separate and often stigmatized remedial program. Ironically, these well-intended policies have led to unforeseen consequences.\nThe discrete incorporation of remedial classes into the colleges' \"credit\" offerings leaves students confused, and many students cannot distinguish between remedial and nonremedial courses. For example, Raymond did not know how some remedial courses differ from other courses in terms of credit. During registration, when he found that a course he needed was closed, he chose to sign up for a reading class instead, not realizing that it was remedial and that he would be paying for a course that would not count toward a degree or transfer credit:\nI wanted a math class, but they said the math classes were too full.... I didn't really need the reading, though, because they said I scored high and I didn't need the reading. I just took it anyway because they didn't have math. So I took it.\nIncluded in this \"credit, but not really credit,\" \"real\" credits and whether these credits will count toward their goals. The situation is like a con man selling a stranger a watch, the value of which will be subsequently discovered to be less than expected. In community colleges, the reason for this action may be face-saving or oversight, but it is likely to mislead students into believing they will get more for their course efforts (and tuition) than they ultimately receive."}, {"section_title": "PITFALLS OF GUIDANCE AND DELAYED RECOGNITION", "text": "The lack of clarity just described leaves students with ambiguous and confused ideas about their remedial status, and they lack the structured guidance they need to make timely and informed decisions about their path through college. Although the ambiguity we have noted in the catalogs and in students' minds could be overcome by effective guidance, these colleges lack the structured guidance necessary to help students navigate the organizations' structure and procedures. College staff usually assume that students will take it upon themselves to discover the degree, certification, and transfer requirements for their program of interest. Many students eventually do, but many wait too long, wasting time and money in the process. This problem is especially acute among students in college remedial classes, the second category. In our interviews, faculty and staff reported a hesitancy to highlight the negative implications of remedial courses, including the lack of \"real\" degree or transfer credits earned in such courses. They feared that such an approach would unduly discourage students.\nHowever, students experience some difficulty from this delayed information. Ivette, who was in her second full-time semester and aiming for an AA degree, responded to the question about how long she thought it would take to complete her degree by saying, \"I still haven't seen what credits I need for the classes.\" Darius was also starting his second semester, and although he had definite plans to transfer to a specific university, he had not found out anything about the requirements for transfer. He thought that he would transfer to a four-year college with junior status the following year. Unfortunately, he was not aware that his full year of \"full-time\" course work-which he thought gave him 24 credits-actually gave him only 9 transferable credits. Five of his eight courses were either remedial or too low to count toward transfer.\nStudents often go for several months, a full semester, or even a full year without knowing that their remedial courses are not counting toward a degree or their transfer goals.\nDonald, a former remedial student, was in his fourth semester at Northwest College, and he had not yet talked to a counselor to find out which classes would be accepted at the university to which he wanted to transfer.\nStudents with low achievement in English or math might have needed to take three terms of remedial courses before they could begin to get actual college credits, but few of these students realized this timetable. In a focus group, a couple of students who were enrolled in a special program that combined several different classes along with their remedial English and reading courses complained that they were not informed about the credit status of their courses: John: We had five classes. For each class, we're supposed to get three credit hours. We came up with just four credit hours [instead of the 15 he was expecting].\nVanessa: We didn't even know that they were college prep classes.\nJohn: We didn't know. Like, they told us that we were in [this program]. They didn't explain exactly like, \"You're going to take this, but you're not going to be credited for this.\" So like at the end when [the counselor said we].\n. Unlike high school, students will come to us voluntarily. We don't have a command performance. Obviously we couldn't have with just eight of us for over 6,000 students. So students do come to us when there's a problem, either personal, academic, or vocational.8\nAlthough counselors are officially the main staff responsible for providing information, in practice, they are not the central resource through which students gain their information. During registration at the beginning of each semester, full-time faculty, counselors, and administrators sit at the registration tables to help students select their courses. All students must meet with one of these staff members to pick and approve their courses. Staff have information about prerequisites and basic degree requirements. However, this is often a rushed and chaotic period, and the particular staff person who advises a student is arbitrary. As a result, the provision of information and advice is a random process, with many faculty knowing little about remedial courses and their implications. In addition, students can get a faculty member to approve their courses before the chaotic registration period. This strategy may be more fruitful, particularly if the faculty member is familiar with the students and their programs. On the other hand, there is still the great risk that students will obtain advice in bits and pieces from faculty members who often have incomplete information about remedial courses. Like Ivette and Darius, many students float around with little knowledge about whether or not they are accurately following their degree requirements because they choose not to visit counselors until they are well on their way toward graduating or transferring.\nThe students expressed regret about their lack of awareness of their remedial status and its implications. David said that he might have decided to forgo college altogether if he had known that his credits were not going to count toward anything:\nI think that a student should know in the beginning ... that these classes, even though we think they're necessary and you would benefit from them, will not count toward graduation. The students should know what they're getting into in the very beginning.

Comparing students in the first year with those in the second year and above, we found improved accuracy over time, with 23.2 percent of first-year students and 29.7 percent beyond their first year correctly reporting that their credits would not count (see Table 1 ). The greater awareness that remedial courses do not count was accompanied by a decline in the proportion of students who were \"not sure,\" while the proportion who held the mistaken belief that these courses count remained constant (almost 39 percent). Despite students' improved accuracy after their first year, over 70 percent of the students beyond their first year were still not aware that their remedial courses did not count toward a degree or transfer.\nIn our interviews, students who were taking multiple remedial courses seemed more confused about their situation. They were making sacrifices, improving themselves, and aiming toward a degree, and no one was telling them any discouraging information, even though they were taking several \"developmental\" courses. The survey data clarify students' response to this situation-students who were taking remedial courses in more subjects were less likely to realize that their courses would not count (see Table 2 ). Even among advanced students, students who were taking three or four remedial course areas were less likely to be aware that remedial courses did not count than were students who were taking one remedial course area (21 percent versus 37 percent). While some correct perceivers may have dropped out (especially by the second year), these findings also support the observations in our interviews: Students who take remedial courses in multiple areas are more likely to misperceive the value of their remedial courses.\nOur survey also asked the students to assess their chances of achieving their degree goals (on a 5-point scale, from very likely to very unlikely). We found that students' perceived likelihood of attaining their degree goals did not decline as they took more remedial subjects (see Table 3 ). Moreover, the remedial students did not have lower degree goals. They were actually slightly more likely to indicate that they were aiming toward a bachelor's degree (versus an associate degree or a certificate) than were the nonremedial students-46.3 percent and 44.2 percent, respectively. Although national data indicate that the dropout rate for students with three or more remedial courses is much higher than for students with only one remedial course (Adelman 1996 (Adelman , 1999 Deil-Amen 2002) , we found that students do not lower their perceived chances of completing their degrees as the number of their remedial courses increases."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "When students enter college, they may not really be college students; they may be taking high school-level courses that provide no \"real\" college credit. This study found that students may not realize their situation and its im tions. We described the several ways tha munity colleges create this circumstance, vertently and with good intentions. Community colleges are faced with serv students who arrive at their doors under pared for \"college-level\" courses, yet fully anticipate that they will complete college degrees. The colleges must deal these students and their high expectatio one community college English pro aptly noted, \"You have to serve your com nity if you're a community college.\" Unlike Clark's (1973) description of cooling-out process, we found that co nity college staff have found ingenious to preserve students' aspirations and conveying stigma to students who are in remedial courses. Indeed, we were impressed with how these community colleges were able to avoid damaging students' self-confidence while encouraging them to improve their skills to qualify for college-level courses and pursue their goals of transferring to four-year colleges.\nHowever, we discovered that this stigmafree approach has some critical unintended consequences. The avoidance of \"remedial\" labels; a hesitancy to highlight students' remedial placements; and the lack of an adequate, structured counseling/advising system led to confusion and misperceptions among the students. Even after two, three, or four semesters, some students were still unclear about whether the courses were giving them college credit and how long it would take them to get a degree. Some students had lost time taking courses they did not need and for which they did not get credit. For students with limited funds and a narrow window of time for college study, such missteps can be costly to their careers. in degree credits they had been expecting.\nThis process looks a lot like the swindles that Goffman (1952) described. Students are being gently led into a long-term process without having any idea of how little progress they are making or how long it will take to attain their goal. They are expending money and efforts, and there is a real risk that many of them will not get a degree and that some will get few or no college credits. The staff have good intentions when they create these misperceptions, but they are deceptive nonetheless.\nCould this deception be in the students' best interest? Is keeping students in college \"for their own good\" similar to the way parents trick their children into eating vegetables that are good for them? There are several reasons to think that deception is inappropriate here. First, these students are not children; they are adults with adult responsibilitiesrent payments, car payments, jobs, spouses, and children-and a strategy of deception is patronizing. Second, these remedial courses are not as costless as eating vegetables. We were astounded at the enormous sacrifices that the students were making to be in college. We interviewed students who had to work 40 hours a week, who had taken out loans, and who were supporting parents and siblings. Some were working parents, for whom their college courses and homework were added on to 60 hours of work and family obligations. Tricking these students into losing sleep, reducing their time with their children, and avoiding overtime assignments at work is certainly more costly than eating vegetables. Third, deception has other costs:\nIt creates credibility problems. Students have implicit timetables. Many students have promised their families that they will get an associate's degree in two years, and when the time comes and goes, parents and spouses are understandably disappointed and angry at the time college has taken away from home and job.\nFourth, these students have other options, which they could choose if they were not deceived. Some college programs require fewer remedial courses. The AAS degree often has fewer academic prerequisites than the AA and AS degrees, so that some students would need fewer noncredit remedial courses. In the colleges we studied, if a student scores poorly on the remedial exam, say at the 10th-grade level, she or he must take three noncredit (remedial) math courses before being able to take one that gives credit for an AA degree. But that same student would only need to take one noncredit math course if she or he were pursuing an AAS degree. Since three remedial courses delays the completion of a degree and may increase the likelihood of dropout (compared to one course), students may choose the AAS to avoid these outcomes. This easier choice is unlikely to affect employment outcomes, since it is unlikely that employers understand the difference between the two degrees. Furthermore, research has shown that taking more applied occupational courses has clear economic benefits (Bishop 1992; Grubb 1996; Rosenbaum 1996) . In many cases, the bulk of these AAS credits can also be transferred to a four-year college if students choose to continue their education. Deception prevents students from even considering these alternative options.\nCommunity colleges and their promise of open access do give disadvantaged students a second chance to overcome obstacles, just as they were intended to do. Unfortunately, this second chance leads to a degree only for a small proportion of students in this situation. Our study highlighted the possibility that the stigma-free approach may represent a more subtle form of blocked opportunity.\nRather than a cooling-out approach that limits opportunity by steering students toward the structural alternative of a lower degree, the delayed recognition caused by a stigmafree approach may be contributing to students dropping out of college altogether and hence accumulating no credentials rather than a lesser degree.\nThe institutional context we described fosters the type of misperceptions that inhibits students' ability to plan their long-term educational and occupational future effectively.\nAt the least, it seems that students are being shortchanged in their chances to consider which the enemy must decide that it is futile and risky to try to recover his lost money.\n2. Although other postsecondary institutions were not included in this study, the impact of remedial programs can and should be explored at four-year colleges as well. All community colleges offer remedial courses, and they are the only institutions that have experienced an increase in remedial enrollments. However, 81 percent of four-year public and 63 percent of four-year private colleges offer remedial courses, and the consequences of these programs on their students is an important area of study (NCES 1996) . Nearly two-thirds of students who attended only a community college or a community college and a four-year college took at least one remedial course, whereas 40 percent of those who attended only a four-year college took at least one remedial course. (NCES 2000:52). 3. Northwest College enrolled about 11,000 students during 1995 in its credit and precredit courses. Of the students in these courses, 61 percent were female and 39 percent were male; 50 percent were white, 27 were percent Latino, 12 percent were Asian, and 9 percent were African American; their average age was 26; 70 percent were enrolled part time; and 38 percent were employed full time. Central college enrolled about 13,000 students in its precredit and credit courses in 1995. Of the students in these courses, 63 percent were female and 37 percent were male; 47 percent were African American, 23 percent were white, 14 percent were Latino, and 11 percent were Asian; their average age was 30; 77 percent were enrolled part time; and 45 percent were employed full time. Indistrict tuition was $47.50 per credit hour.\n4. Surveys were administered to students in class, so the response rate approached 100 percent. Classes were selected to target strategically a cross section of students in remedial courses and particular programs.\n5. Since local funding is partially based on head-count enrollments, the awarding of institutional credit also conveniently allows community colleges to maintain enrollments by giving credit status to students who may otherwise not pay tuition if they were enrolled in noncredit remedial classes. This is a chicken-and-egg situation, however. Often, the more remedial classes a college offers, the fewer sophomore-level courses it offers.\nHowever, in Illinois, as in most states, community colleges did not actively seek to increase their remedial enrollments. They were forced to accommodate to the will of political decision makers, who, in the Board of Higher Education Act, designated community colleges as the place where remediation efforts should be undertaken (Ignash 1997:7) . In fact, many faculty and adminis- 6. We created these classifications. Such concrete distinctions are not specified by the colleges themselves, nor are they presented to students.\n7. A few years ago, students usually had to consult with a four-year college directly or get a \"transfer guide\" from the counseling office for their college and program of interest. These guides were constantly being revised and updated and therefore were often outdated. Many four-year colleges have recently participated in a broad-based articulation agreement that helps to create a consensus between two-and four-year colleges regarding the \"approved\" curricula. As a result, these two community colleges now have a list of transferable courses for schools that participate in the Illinois Articulation Agreement in their catalogs. However, confusion still abounds, since some \"ambiguous\" credit courses count for transfer to some schools but not to others and not for some AS degrees.\n8. The counselor's estimates regarding student enrollments differ from the figure in the preceding paragraph, which was obtained from the district's Office of Planning and\nResearch. The number of students enrolled changes from semester to semester as well as over the course of one semester, due to student withdrawals from the college.\n9. The number of remedial course areas is based on students' reports of the titles of the courses they had taken, which is probably a better indicator than their own count of the number of remedial course areas because students do not always realize that a course is remedial."}]
