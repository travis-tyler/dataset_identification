Men filled out International Prostate Symptom Score questionnaires and underwent uroflowmetry and post-void bladder ultrasound before surgery and at each followup visit.

However, men with baseline PFR <10 mL/s had a 20% lower postoperative PFR over 5 years, suggesting permanent damage to the bladder and the need for early treatment to maintain bladder health. There appears to be an association between baseline PFR \u22647 mL/s and adverse pathologic features. "}, {"section_title": "| INTRODUCTION", "text": "In the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, prostate size was estimated using serial pelvic magnetic resonance imaging in men without prostate cancer and revealed a median growth rate of 2.5% per year. 1 This enlargement is usually related to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which results in an increase in prostate volume and increased stromal smooth muscle tone. As demonstrated by autopsy studies, 2 BPH is more prevalent with age and can cause lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) by compressing the urethra. Men are assessed for BOO using a variety of noninvasive tools, including the validated American Urological Association Symptom Score (AUASS) 3 questionnaire, peak flow rate (PFR) as determined by uroflowmetry (UF), and post-void residual volume (PVR), as well as invasive tools such as urodynamics. A PFR <10 mL/s is commonly used as a surrogate for BOO, and has a predictive value of 70% in correctly identifying patients with BOO. 4 To our knowledge, limited studies have evaluated UF after radical prostatectomy (RP). [5] [6] [7] [8] Previously, we reported a doubling of PFR and a >50% reduction in PVR after open and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP), both of which were stable with long-term follow-up across all age groups. 9, 10 The aim of the present study was primarily to evaluate whether there were significant improvements in PFR from baseline after RARP in men at risk of BOO, similar to those in men without BOO, and whether the improvements persist over long-term follow up. 10 Finally, because several reports have found an association between BOO and nerve growth factor (NGF), [11] [12] [13] we explored whether this relationship resulted in a more aggressive prostate cancer. was reviewed for men who underwent prospective UF testing. Of 1300 such men, 1082 (83%) qualified for analysis with a preoperative voided volume (VV) of 150 mL (see Figure S1 , available as Supplementary Material to this paper). In the present study, BOO was defined as PFR <10 mL/s during UF. 4 Men were then divided into 2 groups based according to preoperative PFR: those with PFR <10 mL/s (n = 158) and those with PFR \u226510 mL/s (n = 924; Figure S1 ). The number of men with preoperative PFR <10 mL/s providing postoperative UF voiding \u2265150 mL at 3, 9, and 15 months, and 2-4, 5-7, and >8 years was 68, 43, 31, 22, 11, and 4, respectively. In the group with preoperative PFR \u226510 mL/s, the number of men postoperative UF voiding \u2265150 mL at 3, 9, and 15 months, and Portbury, Bristol BS20 7XE UK), followed by PVR measured by transabdominal ultrasound. The Dantec device was set to a maximum PFR reading of 51 mL/s. Men were considered inadequately filled if VVs were <150 mL at any time point 15 and were not included in the final analysis. For consistency, the UF graphs were evaluated manually for voiding artifacts (i.e. eliminating false spikes due to straining). Finally, 5 and 3 patients with fossa navicularis stricture and bladder neck contracture, respectively, met the study's inclusion criteria and were included for completeness. All these men had preoperative PFR \u226510 mL/s. Lymph node dissection was not performed on low-risk patients. Resection of the apex has been described previously. 16 3 | RESULTS"}, {"section_title": "| METHODS", "text": "With"}, {"section_title": "| Statistical analysis", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "| Baseline characteristics", "text": "Results of the AUASS and UF examinations for the 1082 men who had a preoperative UF with VV \u2265150 mL are given in Table 1 into 2 groups using the median value (7 mL/s) as the cut-off point (Table 2) , and the preoperative parameters did not differ significantly between these groups, except for PSA and pathological cancer variables (LNI, SVI, and high-risk Gleason scores)."}, {"section_title": "| Post-RARP UF outcomes", "text": "The mean follow-up period for the entire cohort, men with PFR <10 mL/s, and men with PFR \u226510 mL/s was 1.4 years (range 0.1--10.0 years), 1.32 years (range 0.25-9.6 years), and 1.4 years (range 0.1-10.0 years), respectively. Preoperative IPSS was significantly worse in men with PFR <10 mL/s than in those with PFR \u226510 mL/s, but this difference was no longer evident at 3 months (6.2 vs. 6.7, respectively). In addition, although PFR, PVR, and VV differed significantly between the 2 groups at baseline, at 3 months only PFR and PVR remained significantly different (P < .04). Figure 1A shows that in both groups (i.e. those with PFR <10 and \u226510 mL/s), the largest improvement in PFR is seen at 3 months (P < .001). In men with baseline PFR <10 mL/s, there was a 3-fold improvement at 3 months (from a mean of 7.0 to 24.2 mL/s) at 3 months, compared with a 50% improvement in men with preoperative PFR \u226510 mL/s (from a mean of 19.7 to 28.9 mL/s; P < .001 for all). Postoperative PFR improvement at 3 months for men with baseline PFR <10 mL/s remained stable over a period of 5 years (all P > .36). In men with PFR \u226510 mL/s, there was an approximate~3 mL/s improvement from 3 to 9 months (P = .026), after which the PFR remained stable for periods of >5 years. Although PFR improved significantly after RARP in both groups, men with baseline PFR <10 mL/s never reached the same postoperative PFR as men with baseline PFR \u226510 mL/s; in fact, PFR in the former group was 20% lower than in the latter group.\nIn short-term paired analysis of the 545 men with data for both preoperative and 3-month UF, nearly all men with initial PFR <10 mL/s (n = 68) improved by 3 months, with 31% having a PFR between 11 and 20 mL/s and 62% having a PFR >20 mL/s.\nOnly 5 men with preoperative PFR <10 mL/s had a PFR <10 mL/s 3 months after RARP. Thus, 62% of patients with preoperative PFR <10 mL/s had a 2-fold increase in PFR. At 2-4 years of follow-up, 1 man had a postoperative PFR <10 mL/ s, 8 of 22 men (36%) had a PFR between 11 and 20 mL/s, and 13 of 22 men (59%) had a PFR >20 mL/s, establishing that the changes persisted over the intermediate follow-up period. Of the men with baseline PFR \u226510 mL/s, 47% and 57% had a >50% improvement in PFR at 3 months and 2-4 years, respectively, and only 10% and 7% had a >25% decline in PFR at 3 months and 2-4 years, respectively. The IPSS indirectly measures the effects on UF using 3 subscales (Emptying, Weak stream, and Straining), all of which indicated significant improvements in men with baseline PFR <10 mL/s (from a total score for all 3 subscales of 3.8 at baseline to 1.3 at 3 months; P < .001). These 3 parameters also improved in men with PFR \u226510 mL/s, from 2.4 at baseline to 1.6 at 3 months (P < .001).\nThe PVR in the 2 groups (i.e. those with PFR <10 and \u226510 mL/s)\ndeclined by >50% at 3 months (P < .001) and to 30 mL at 2-7 years ( Figure 1b) . By 9 months, the difference in PVR between the 2 groups was negligible (P = .46). Men with preoperative PFR <10 mL/s voided, on average, 290 mL with no decline in VV at any time point postoperatively (all P > .3). In comparison, men with preoperative PFR \u226510 mL/s showed a small 13% decline in VV from preoperative levels to 3 months (from 403 to 353 mL), but remained stable over the long term (>5 years)."}, {"section_title": "| Preoperative predictors of postoperative UF outcomes", "text": "When analyzing the cohort as a whole, univariate analysis revealed that age, preoperative PFR, and preoperative PSA were significantly associ- 3.4 | Oncologic findings in men with preoperative PFR <10 mL/s\nBaseline pathological findings are given in Table 1 .

Interestingly, LNI was present only in men with preoperative PFR \u22647 mL/s ( (Table 3 ). When using PFR as a categorical variable (PFR \u22647 vs. 7.1-9.9 mL/s), SVI was statistically significant, and Gleason score \u22658 was a significant trend (Table 3) . Furthermore, after adjusting for clinical preoperative variables, preoperative PFR as a categorical variable remained an independent predictor of SVI (Table 3) ."}, {"section_title": "| DISCUSSION", "text": "The present study revealed that after undergoing RARP men with baseline PFR <10 mL/s have significant relief by 3 months, with increased PFR and marginal gains thereafter to a mean PFR of \u226520 mL/s. Clinically it is important to note that men with PFR <10 mL/s 3 months after RARP are uncommon and, if found, should be evaluated for possible strictures. Also significant was the 50% reduction in PVR in the PFR <10 mL/s group, which may be reflected by the improved QoL scores for this group at 3 months. This contrasts with men with PFR \u226510 mL/s before RARP, who reported a slightly worse QOL at 3 months.\nThe major finding of the present study is that in men presenting with BOO, mean PFR is reduced by 20% at both the short-and longterm (5 years) follow-up compared with men with no perceptible preoperative voiding dysfunction. This suggests injury to the bladder wall by chronic bladder ischemia, leading to permanently reduced ability to empty the bladder due to detrusor muscle damage. 17 Thus, earlier treatments are warranted to maintain bladder health in patients pre- relieved by robotic prostatectomy compared with other treatment options. 18 The Olmsted study found that 72% of men with PFR <10 mL/s had an annual decrease in PFR of \u22654.5%, 19 indicating that PFR continues to deteriorate over time in symptomatic men with BPH. The present study showed that flow rates in all but 5 men with initial PFR <10 mL/s improved by 3 months after RARP. In fact, 62% of patients with preoperative PFR <10 mL/s had a 2-fold increase in PFR that persisted over the long-term follow-up, similar to findings for open RP."}, {"section_title": "7,20", "text": "The post-RARP PFR results reported herein mirror those reported in the GOLIATH study. 21 In that study, mean PFR 3 months after 180-W XPS green light laser vaporization or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) was 23.9 and 24.6 mL/s, respectively, 21 similar to the post-RARP PFR of 24.2 mL/s reported herein. In a meta-analysis comparing bipolar and monopolar TURP, mean PFR at 12 months was in the range 16.6-23.2 and 15.9-24.2 mL/s, respectively. 22 After RARP, men with preoperative PFR <10 mL/s had a slightly higher mean PFR (25.4 and 28.2 mL/s at 9 and 15 months, respectively) than men with preoperative PFR \u226510 mL/s. In the aforementioned meta-analysis, the need for a second procedure for adenoma regrowth ranged from 3.6% to 4.3%. 22 Comparing the results of the present study with those of a published series of 67 robotic-assisted simple prostatectomies (RASP) with a median follow-up of 6 months, 23 PFRs were similar at around 23 mL/s, but the median (interquartile range) PVR in the RASP study was 0 mL (0-36 mL).\nThe present study is the first large-sized study to evaluate UF changes in men at risk of BOO with prostate cancer pathology after RARP. The study found a higher incidence of Gleason scores \u22658\n(OR 0.69), positive LNI (OR 0.499), and SVI (OR 0.644) in a significant number of men with PFR \u22647 mL/s (8.1%) compared with men with a PFR of 7.1-9.9 mL/s (Tables 1-2 ). This is in contrast with the results of the to the prostate screening study of Cormio et al. 24 that found no association between PFR and prostate cancer. Cormio et al. 24 did report a significant trend in greater clinical Gleason scores 8-10 for PFR <10 mL/s, but the results did not discriminate for PFR \u22647 mL/s, which the present study suggests is a putative risk for Gleason Score \u22658. It is of note that the findings of the present study suggest that of men with a preoperative PFR \u22647 mL/s undergoing RARP, 14% will have a Gleason score in the range 8-10, compared with rates of 6.2%-12.3% reported in the contemporary literature. [25] [26] [27] At first glance PFR \u22647 mL/s would seem unlikely to be associated If a cut-off value of PFR \u22647 mL/s was used, adjusted analyses comparing all men with PFR \u22647 mL/s with those with PFR \u22658 mL/s revealed that both SVI (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.3-5.9) and LNI (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.3-7.3) were significantly greater in the former. These findings persisted when PSA was included in the analysis, with the OR slightly reduced to 2.6. When men who had been excluded from the study because their VV was between 100 and 149 mL were included in the analysis, the trend for the 17 men with pathological Gleason scores of 8-10 was 47% with PFR \u22647 mL/s, 18% with PFR 7-9.9 mL/s, and 35% for PFR \u226510 mL/s (P = .06).\nThe association between low PFR and aggressive disease may affect decisions regarding surgery versus radiation therapy. Prostate In the present study, BOO was defined as PFR <10 mL/s during UF because this cut-off value has a specificity of 64%, a positive predictive value of 70%, and a sensitivity of 72%. 4 However, we acknowledge that a low flow rate on UF can also be due to detrusor hypocontractility 33 and only urodynamic evaluation can reliably distinguish between impaired bladder contraction and BOO. 34, 35 Detrusor function would best be examined by urodynamic studies in this group of men, who represent an optimal study group for future research.\nThe present study has several limitations, other than its retrospective design. Information regarding preoperative use of alphablockers and/or 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors was not available. The number of men with preoperative PFR <10 mL/s and available UF data at long-term follow-up was relatively small. Because University of California, Irvine (UCI) is a referral center, this limits our ability to have patients return for long-term follow-up. In addition, patients only performed 1 uroflow per visit, which does not account for intra-subject variability. We note that all men in our study had confirmed prostate cancer, but rarely were they screened for uroflow prior to coming to UCI Urology. A pathologic limitation of the present study is the absence of data relating to the quantification of tumor volume in the prostatectomy specimen. However, the present study is the first large-sized study of RARP to describe UF changes in men with prostate cancer, and general post-uroflow improvements after robotic prostatectomy in men at risk of BOO.\nBoth PFR and PVR improved significantly after RARP, regardless of baseline PFR, and improvements persisted over the long-term follow-up. However, postoperative PFR was 20% lower among men with baseline PFR <10 mL/s 5-8 years after RP, suggesting permanent damage to the bladder by chronic obstruction. Earlier treatment is warranted to maintain bladder health. There appears to be an association between low preoperative PFR and high-grade prostate cancer, as well as LNI and SVI, although the reasons for this remain speculative at present."}, {"section_title": "DISCLOSURE", "text": "Thomas E.
