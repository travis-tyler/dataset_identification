Among many alternatives, surge suppression systems have gained particular interest among policy makers, planners and researchers. The Galveston Bay region (herein referred to as the bay) represents one of the most flood-and surge-prone areas in the United States (SURGEDAT 2017). Due to its vulnerability there has been a particular interest in comprehensively assessing a coastal storm surge suppression system (aka coastal spine) proposed as a mitigation strategy after 2008's Hurricane Ike that brought historic surge levels and impacted local economies in the Southeast Texas. The urgency to address this issue has been heighted as there is a growing consensus that surge height could increase in response to an increase in hurricane intensities and sea-level rise (SLR). Some recent studies suggest flood heights of storm surge associated with 1 in every 100 year to become as frequent as one in every four years, and this all due to SLR creating a higher \"launch point\" for future storm surges (Frumhoff et al. 2007). Prior research conducted on this topic has focused on quantifying impacts of surge events on property and industrial assets locally (Atoba et al., 2018;Davlasheridze et al. 2018). However, little has been done to view the problem from regional and national perspectives. Nationally strategic assets located in the bay such as petroleum refineries, petro-chemical manufacturing and the Port of Houston all bear merits in presenting the problem in the context of the nation. Understanding the spatial economic spillovers of surge impacts on the larger economy and long-term socioeconomic ramifications are important for economic stability of other states as well as for the nation as a whole, and will further contribute to a better understanding of the scope of economic damages and the economic feasibility of a surge suppression system. This report presents the results of a nation-wide economic study of storm surge impacts on the three counties along the Galveston Bay (Galveston, Harris and Chambers) and explores how direct impacts on a specific sector(s) in the bay communities propagate through the economy of TX as well economies of other states and the nation as a whole in the long term, while capturing general equilibrium and multiplier effects."}, {"section_title": "Economic Model", "text": "The economic impacts presented in this report are derived from a 23 sector, multi-year state-level Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) Model. By including the national and global economies, and linking them to the Texas economy, the model captures essential economic relationships that influence the economic impacts of storm surge along the gulf coast of Southeast Texas. The 23 sectors included in the economic model encompass sectors that are of great importance to the Texas state economy and human wellbeing. Specifically, the two surge-sensitive sectors were selected (i) residential housing (referred to as dwelling throughout) and (ii) petroleum refinery and chemical manufacturing sectors. Beyond these major sensitive sectors, aggregation of similar sectors was guided by model calibration and stability of the model results. Because this study examines the economy-wide impacts of storm surge, the economic model captures general equilibrium 1 and multiplier effects 2 of individual sectoral responses to surge events."}, {"section_title": "Assessment Period", "text": "In this study, the impacts of surge events on the economy are considered for 50-years in the future, starting from the year 2016 and ending with the year 2066. As an extension, we also incorporate surge impacts under the SLR using the SLR projections in 2080. Additional model simulations are also conducted for the ending year 2080. The choice of 50 year time span was guided by two principles: (1) human behavior, the underlying theoretical foundation of the CGE model, and the subsequent evolution of regional economic systems are much more uncertain than is the evolution of surge events (forecast errors in economic modeling increase rapidly with forecast length) and (2) 50 years is a typical time span used to assess the feasibility of flood protection structures in the United States by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the primary federal agency responsible for the large scale infrastructure projects."}, {"section_title": "Scenarios", "text": "Selection of scenarios in this report were guided by (i) surge events, (ii) policy responses and (iii) the duration of production cessation for major industrial plants in the area. Synthetic storms were used to generate exposure of assets relative to water inundation levels. Each storm has different probability of occurrence in a given year and provides the possibility to assess the bandwidth of likely impacts to the states' and national economies associated with storms of different intensities. The most intense and destructive storm is the 500-year storm, with an annual probability of 0.2%, followed by the 100-year (1%) storm surge, 10-year (10%) and an Ike-like storm surge. The selection of the latter was guided by the hurricane Ike, a category 2 hurricane that struck Southeast coast of Texas in 2008 and brought a historic amount of surge levels. Ike remains the most recent hurricane accompanied with major surge event for the bay communities, as Hurricane Harvey in August 2017 for the area was a precipitation event. 1 Some economic sectors will be impacted by surge events indirectly because of direct impacts on more sensitive economic sectors within the region (e.g., dwelling and petro products & chemical manufacturing sectors). Hence it is expected the surge impacts on a specific sector(s) will also impact prices of capital, labor, materials, or other production inputs facing producers in another economic sector. Similarly, surge impacts on one sector(s) may also affect output prices received by producers in another sector. The price changes (both outputs and inputs) stimulate substitution away from higher-priced goods and toward lower-priced goods. These phenomena acting through markets and prices are commonly referred to as general equilibrium effects. The surge inundation outputs were modified by factoring in a 17' coastal spine system, as a surge suppression mitigation strategy proposed for the region. Hence for each surge scenario, economic impacts are assessed with and without the coastal spine. Direct impacts to petroleum and chemical manufacturing sector are modeled through the lost output value (lost sales/revenues) associated with the cessation of production operation. Without knowing specific causes of shutdown, and relying on past reports and published data, it was assumed that plants shut down for 18, 26 and 33 days either because surge events cause a failure of main electric system or equipment due to a power outage or plants simply close for precautionary purposes. For the sake of brevity, in this report results associated with 33 day shutdown are reported. Other results were built in a companion web-based Atlas for visual presentation (http://www.texascoastalatlas.com/coastalspine/).

Economic indicators in the BAU scenario are derived by simulating the economic model forward in time given projections of key exogenous economic variables (population, working age population, saving rates, depreciation rates, government taxes, rates of productivity growth, and rates of improvement in capital and labor quality). Economic indicators with storm surge are derived by simulating the model forward in time with changes in selected parameters (e.g., for the housing sector capital endowment is reduced by the amount of estimated property damages, for the petroleum and chemical manufacturing sectors total factor productivity growth rates are adjusted until output losses solved in the model matches the estimated losses that correspond to the different shut-down days in the petroleum and chemical manufacturing sectors) as a way to reflect the impacts of surge on underlying economic conditions. Two types of economic simulations are conducted. One type estimates the impacts of surge events on individual sectors (i.e., housing and petroleum and chemical manufacturing separately). This exercise allows us to disentangle the economic effects of surge from each of the sectors, such as housing, on others, such as petroleum and chemical manufacturing, so as to better understand the direct and sectoral-level effects of surge events. In the second type we estimate the economic impacts when storm surge affects all surge-sensitive sectors simultaneously to fully capture indirect and induced effects on Texas' own economy as well as economies on other states and the nation as a whole through trade and labor flows across states."}, {"section_title": "Damage to the Housing Sector", "text": "Storm surge is projected to impact the housing (i.e. dwelling) sector negatively by destroying residential property located in inundated areas.

Using the supplied damage-depth functions, the losses to individual properties were estimated without a coastal spine and one with the coastal spine system. Destruction of property represents the decline of capital endowment to households in the CGE model who are assumed to own factors of production. Depending on the intensity of the storm, direct property damages in the three counties were estimated in the range of $8.5 billion (associated with 500-year storm), $4.6 billion (with 100-year storm), half a billion (10-year storm), and 3 billion with Ike-like storm without the coastal spine. These figures correspond to negligible shares to the entire state's GDP. For example, the most intense 500-year damages represent only 0.5% of the total state GDP in 2016 prices, however correspond to 11% of the sector's total output in Texas. Notably, the coastal spine mitigates the bulk of residential losses, reducing estimated damages by four times relative to the estimated damages without the surge suppression system."}, {"section_title": "Petroleum and Chemical Manufacturing", "text": "Petroleum and chemical manufacturing sectors are other sensitive sectors that are assumed to be directly impacted by surge events in the region. Based on published reports and data, it was assumed that the destruction of industrial property will have minimal impact on disrupting sector production operation. However, plants may experience substantial output (revenue/sales) losses if they close due to electrical equipment and control room (including Systems and Operating) failure or due to power outages. We assumed plants to be down for as little as 18 days and the maximum shutdown days considered was 33 days. Subsequent revenue losses were calculated for each of the shutdown durations. For the purpose of modeling economy-wide impacts of output losses associated with plant shutdown, it was assumed shutdowns will affect efficiency and intensity of the inputs utilized in production process. Thus, the impact was model through reduction in total factor productivity (TFP) associated with all input factors (i.e. capital, labor, energy, and material) in a corresponding sector (i.e., petroleum and chemical manufacturing sectors). Total output losses associated with different shutdown durations were estimated in the range of $4.3 -$8 billion associated with the 500-year storm surge event without a coastal spine and only $116 -$213 million when a coastal spine was in place. It should also be noted that industry losses were fully mitigated with spine protection under 10-year and Ike-like storm events. The resultant output loss of 33day shutdown represents approximately 8% of the total output value of these sectors in Texas in 2016.

The idea of the spine emerged after 2008's Hurricane Ike that brought historic surge levels and impacted local economies in Southeast Texas (TAMUG 2017), and has again received the revived interest after hurricane Harvey in 2017 (Rebuild Texas 2017). Prior studies and efforts have focused on delineating hazard exposure of structures and industries (Atoba et al., 2018;Burleson et al., 2015) as well as quantifying the benefits of a spine realized in terms of avoided direct damages (Davlasheridze et al., 2018). However, other second-order impacts of destructive surge events and the subsequent benefits of a surge mitigation system have not been well demonstrated. Large surge events may trigger a variety of indirect effects including disruption of supply linkages and commodity shipments, temporary cessation of production operation, and cascading adverse effects across interdependent economic systems. Disruption of some of the important and strategic assets located in the bay area (e.g., oil refineries, petro-chemical manufacturing, etc.) could reverberate throughout not only the local or regional economy, but may also have significant economic and social implications for other states and the nation, and may also impact their economies in the long term (Kousky 2014;Cavallo & Noy 2011;MacKenzie, Santos, & Barker 2012;Norio et al. 2011). Understanding the spatial economic spillovers of surge impacts on the larger economy and long-term socioeconomic ramifications are important for the economic stability of other states as well as for the nation as a whole, and will further contribute to a better understanding of the scope of economic damages and the economic feasibility of a surge suppression system. This study builds on and further extends previous research on this subject by developing a nation-wide economic model using the framework of the Computable General Equilibrium Model (CGE). The CGE model allows for modeling economic impact at the sector level, and explores how direct impacts on a specific sector(s) propagate through the economy as a whole while capturing general equilibrium and multiplier effects. The CGE model has a rigorous theoretical foundation and has been widely used by scholars and policy makers to model economic impacts associated with policy changes at the sector level (Bohringer et al., 2003;Bergman, 1991;Shoven and Whalley, 1992; as well as the economy-wide implications of extreme events (Rose and Guha, 2004;Rose and Liao, 2005;Rose, Oladosu, & Liao, 2007;Sue-Wing, Rose and Wein, 2015) and climate change (Abler et al., 2009;Hsiang et al., 2017). The details of the model are provided in the subsequent sections. Second-order (indirect and induced impacts) are modeled through direct impacts on the two primary sectors that are the most surge-sensitive: (i) the dwelling sector and (ii) petroleum refinery and chemical manufacturing sectors. Direct impacts through property losses are estimated by integrating outputs from the Advanced CIRCulation Model (ADCIRC) that generates water inundation associated with different intensity storms with the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) US Multi-Hazard (Hazus-MH) model. The same ADCIRC inundation outputs are also used to identify petroleum refinery and chemical manufacturing plant hazard exposures and integrated with Chemplant data to estimate output losses associated with production cessation due to a storm surge. As such, the modeling framework integrates three models, ADCIRC, HAZUS-MH and Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models, along with assumptions related to plant-shut down durations, to estimate state-industry-and nation-wide macroeconomic impacts of surge events effecting the Galveston Bay region in Texas. The impact scenarios are built around the intensity of storms and also factor in the mitigating effects of a coastal spine.

The three counties, hereafter referred to asreferred the Houston Galveston Area (HGA) region covers 2,727 square miles and is one of the most populous regions in the U.S. According to the 2010 census, its population is approximately 4.42 million. The Houston metropolitan area, which is part of Harris County is the third most populated metro area in the U.S. and accounts for approximately 93% of total population of the HGA. The most recent report by the Houtson-Galveston Area Council indicates that the population will surpass 6.3 million by 2040 (HGAC, 2017). The Galveston Bay region, often referred to as petrochemical capital of the U.S., houses one-third of the petroleum refineries in the U.S. and represents the second largest petro-chemical complexes in the world. In addition to these strategic assets, the HGA is a home of the Port of Houston, which is largest port in the U.S. in terms of import and export tonnage (Port of Houston 2017). The region contributes approximately a quarter of the Texas Gross State Product (GSP) with an estimated GSP value of $341 billion, and employs over 60% of the state's total population (MIG 2012). The HGA is also one of the most flood-and surge-prone areas in the U.S. (SURGEDAT 2017) and on average, experiences a major hurricane once every 15 years (Parisi and Lund 2008). The area's geography and local climate, coupled with population and economic exposure, make this region particularly vulnerable to damaging storms. While Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was the most damaging hurricane for the region, the bulk of these damages were due to heavy rainfall and abnormal precipitation. The most recent surge event was generated by the 2008's Hurricane Ike, which spurred the initial policy discussion around the coastal spine system (i.e. Ike Dike) as a mitigation alternative to address surge-induced impacts regionally (TAMUG 2017). It is envisioned that the spine will be a complex system connecting seawalls and fortified dunes/levees along the coastline to retractable gates located at the mouth of Galveston Bay and San Luis Pass (see Figure 1).

The model generates estimates of economic losses to general building stock, lifelines, utilities, debris and the associated social impacts, as well as the resultant avoided loss from mitigation (Scawthorn et al. 2006a;2006b;Ding et al. 2008). The HAZUS-MH default building inventory is based on Census block group-level data containing extensive sets of information such as population demographics, structural characteristics of buildings (e.g. square footage), numbers and locations of critical infrastructure (e.g. bridges, hospitals, utility lifelines, schools, etc.). The Comprehensive Data Management System (CDMS) permits users to update and manage default datasets utilized in HAZUS-MH analyses with more detailed and accurate data specific to a location of interest. For this study, the HAZUS-MH default building inventory was updated using parcel-level information for the three counties (Galveston, Harris and Chambers), such as building improvement year, amounts spent on improvement, building materials, structural cost, and square footage.

According to U.S. Department of Energy estimates, these two causes have constituted over 80% of electrical problems in U.S. refineries during 2009-2013, of which 14% were caused by inclement weather incidents (i.e. hurricanes, winds, thunderstorms). Hence, rather than modeling industrial property losses, we calculated total value of production output loss for each industrial plant and aggregated them at the sectoral level. In Appendix Table B1 we report NAICS codes and names for all sectors aggregated in petro-and chemical-manufacturing sectors for CGE modeling purposes. In order to generate the value of production output losses as described in Davlasheridze et al.

For each of the shut-down periods, relevant output value losses were calculated using the daily output value (based on calculations described above) for all relevant firms multiplied by the total number of days plants were assumed to be down. 6 Individual plant level output losses were then aggregated up to NAICS industry for each county. Output losses for petro-and chemical-manufacturing sectors along with residential losses (structure and contents) to the dwelling sector in the CGE model associated with different storm surge and plant shutdown scenarios were converted to 2016 dollars using Urban Consumer Price Index (presented in Table  2). The economic impacts simulated in the CGE model are based on the losses presented in Table 2 above. It is important to emphasize that losses to the dwelling sector dominate the total direct impacts associated with all different synthetic storm surge events, making up more than half of damages. In the scenario where plants only shut down for 18 days, the dwelling sector suffers more than 66% of all total direct losses locally.

The CGE model is based on the premise of the three governing principles of General Equilibrium theory, namely (1) supply equals demand (i.e. all markets clear), (2) producers cannot earn excess profit (i.e. zero profit condition) and (3) consumers exhaust all income (i.e. purchase commodities based on their budget, which equals total income net savings). The model specifies a consumer utility function and a production function as well as elasticities of substitution among input factors and simulates economic impacts using these three principles as guides."}, {"section_title": "Consumers", "text": "Consumers (i.e. households) are endowed with a supply of labor and capital, which represent factors of production for firms. Households receive income from firms who employ these production inputs (i.e. wages are paid for labor and profits are paid for capital), and allocate this income for consumption of goods and services and savings. Households maximize their utility that measures their level of satisfaction through purchasing a bundle of goods and services (e.g. food, housing, energy and others) given their budget constraints (i.e. income minus savings). In the CGE model consumer utility is modeled using a nested constant elasticity of substitution (CES) utility function. The CES function allows different rates of substitutions (i.e. elasticities of substitution 7 ) across different commodities (i.e. a food composite good, a housing composite good, an energy composite good, and 11 other non-food, nonhouse and non-energy goods) within the same utility function. For example, the elasticity of substitution between food and housing is different from the elasticity of substitution between food and energy goods.\nThe consumer sector is modeled as a utility-maximizing representative consumer that derives utility from the consumption of commodities, is assumed to supply labor inelastically, and is the owner of capital stock. The household sector in each region receives income from the employment of labor and capital. Therefore, private income in region r at time t can be written as: where denotes labor income from supplying LS units of effective labor, and YK denotes capital income from supplying KS units of effective capital. YL is equal to: where represents the wage rate received by households. The relationship between labor demand and supply is described below. LS is a function of the working age population (POP W ) and an index of labor quality (q L ); i.e., , = , (B.4) In each region, household income is allocated between consumption ( , ) and savings (S P ). In this model we use a simple Solow growth model formulation with an exogenous savings rate ( , ) to determine private savings ( , ): The household savings rate is chosen to mirror the observed rates in the benchmark data set. Household utility is a nested CES function of consumption goods financed by household income net savings. The nested structure adopted in the model is shown in Figure A.2 Household utility, therefore, is a CES function of a food composite good, a housing composite good, an energy composite good, and 13 other (i.e., non-food, non-housing, and non-energy) goods. "}, {"section_title": "Producers", "text": "Producers, representing different industries, are assumed to be profit maximizers who transform factors of production (i.e. labor, capital, energy and materials) into commodities using specified production technologies. Similar to consumers, the functional form for production technology (a nested Cobb-Douglas-constant elasticity of substitution function is used in the CGE model) accounts for different elasticities of substitution between factors of production within the same production function. For example, the elasticity of substitution between energy and materials can take on a different value than that for capital and labor. Commodities produced by producers are purchased by households and governments as final consumption goods or other firms as intermediate goods.\nEach of the 35 industries is assumed to be a profit maximizer where output is produced using a constant returns to scale technology. For each sector j in region r at time t this can be expressed as: where , , , , , , and , , , are capital, labor, and intermediate inputs, respectively and ( ) represents autonomous technological change which improves total factor productivity. A nested Cobb-Douglasconstant elasticity of substitution (CD-CES) functional form was adopted in the model. By nesting production functions, the model can account for different elasticities of substitution within the same functional form. Figure A-1 below displays the nesting structure of the production sector. As shown in Figure A-1, the top nest of the CD-CES production function consists of a Cobb-Douglas aggregate of value-added (i.e., capital (K) and labor (L)), and a CES aggregate of energy I and non-energy materials (M) inputs with an elasticity of substitution (\u03c3KLEM) of 0.6 between the KL and EM aggregates. The second tier separates the EM aggregate into an energy composite and a non-energy materials composite, both CES aggregates with elasticities of substitution (\u03c3M and \u03c3E) of 0.6 and 0.8, respectively.

The energy composite includes coal mining I, petroleum refining and products (PRP), natural gas distribution (NGD), oil and gas extraction (OG), and electricity (ELE).

Different from an input-output (IO) table that shows the relationship between inputs and outputs among factors of production, consumption, government, investment, export, and import, a SAM is an expanded version of an IO table and shows the entire monetary flow of the economy. For example, a SAM contains detailed information about payments arising from different sources such as ownership of certain assets, direct taxes on corporations and households, pensions, and transfers. The basic structure of the SAM is based on the following transactions and transfers in the economy: 1) production requires intermediate goods and factor of production such as labor, capital, energy, and materials; 2) these factor endowments are contributed by institutions such as households, firms, government, and foreign entities, which in turn receive factor payments (e.g., wage, rent, and profits), called value-added (VA). Therefore, a SAM shows the interrelationship between value-added and final expenditure. A balanced SAM shows an exact correspondence between rows and columns, which indicates the following relationship: 1) supply equals demand for all goods and factors; 2) tax payments equal tax receipts; 3) zero profits in production; 4) the value of each household expenditure equals the value of factor income plus transfers; 5) the value of government tax revenue equals the value of transfers."}, {"section_title": "Sector Aggregation", "text": "The IMPLAN 536 finer-scale sectors were aggregated to 23 industrial sectors (see Table 3) including the key sectors of interest such as petroleum refineries (i.e. petro products), chemical manufacturing (including petrochemicals), and dwelling (residential housing) sectors.

Hence it is expected the surge impacts on a specific sector(s) will also impact prices of capital, labor, materials, or other production inputs facing producers in another economic sector. Similarly, surge impacts on one sector(s) may also affect output prices received by producers in another sector. The price changes (both outputs and inputs) stimulate substitution away from higher-priced goods and toward lower-priced goods. These phenomena acting through markets and prices are commonly referred to as general equilibrium effects. Multiplier Impacts Changes in input prices (i.e., prices of labor, capital, energy and materials) can lead to changes in personal income, because in the CGE model individuals are assumed to be owners and suppliers of these inputs. Hence the direct impacts on one sector can generate a chain reaction of additional rounds of indirect effects through the changes in personal income, often referred to as induced effects. The total impact accounts for all rounds of effects on all economic sectors which represents some multiple of the direct impacts (referred to as \"multiplier effects\"). Furthermore, Texas' economy is interconnected with other states, especially with economies of surrounding states and regions, and the rest of the world. The ripple effects on economies of other states are captured through exports, imports, inflows and outflows of capital, and in-migration and outmigration of labor across states. Changes in the input and output prices of goods and services produced in surge-sensitive sectors in Texas, in particular in petro and chemical manufacturing sectors that produce tradable goods, will also impact prices and inputs of different sectors in other states and will result in changes in cost of production, productivity, input and output prices. For some states, in particular for those relying on goods and services produced by these surge-sensitive sectors, these changes could be detrimental, while other states may benefit from surge events in Texas because of the substitution possibility among inputs and goods. The impacts described above are those that influence the economy through the market mechanisms (supply equals demand for all traded goods and services). Hence, the impacts generated by the CGE represent the market impacts of surge events. While storm surge can destroy valuable ecosystem services that are not traded in markets, reduced quality of life, human health and more, they are not captured in this study. The multi-year, multi-sector economic models are best used for the purpose of capturing economic impacts through market and are not generally capable of nonmarket impacts analysis."}, {"section_title": "Baseline Economic Conditions", "text": "The economic impacts analysis presented in this report involves comparing economic conditions without and with surge events. The economy without a storm surge incident is the reference economy and is referred to as the Business As Usual (BAU) economy. Generating the BAU scenario requires consideration of potential economic conditions in the future. We use 50-year time span for simulation given projections of state-level population and key exogenous parameters such as annual growth rates of multi-factor productivity and annual rate of improvement in labor quality. Labor supply in the model is the product of working age population and labor quality. Population data were obtained from the U.S. Census using 2016 data. In the baseline scenario, the steady population growth rate was assumed over time based on average annual growth rate in the past. To capture the changes of the work force over time, in the model we adjusted the labor quality parameter. The underlying assumption is that the quality of the labor force changes due to education, experience and age. Given the expectation of higher educational attainment in the future, we assumed that labor quality grows at 2.5 percent per year initially, falling to a growth rate of 0.5 percent per year by the end of the modeling period. Similarly, capital quality changes in the model. This change indicates the shift in the composition of capital towards assets with shorter life. Similar to labor quality, we assumed that capital quality will rise by 2.5 percent per year initially, falling to a growth rate of 0.5 percent by the end of the modeling period. In addition to growth in capital stocks, population growth, and labor and capital quality improvements over time, economic growth in the model is driven by improvements in total factor productivity (TFP). An improvement in TFP implies that fewer inputs are required to produce a unit of output. Sectoral TFP improvements in the model were chosen to generate estimates of growth in output and employment that replicate published state-level projections by industry from sources such as the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The model also assumes improvements in autonomous energy efficiency of 2 percent per year over the modeling period, consistent with published forecasts. Table 4 above lists these parameters along with data sources. Finally, an important parameter for the growth of economy is the household savings rate, which is calibrated by household and region using base year (2016) data and is set constant over time."}, {"section_title": "Impact Scenarios", "text": "Economic indicators with storm surge events are derived by also simulating the model forward in time with changes in selected parameters (e.g. sector productivity growth rates and endowment of capital stock) to reflect the impacts of surge events on underlying economic conditions. The plant shut-down affects how efficiently and intensively the inputs are utilized in production. Thus, we change the scaling parameter that affects total factor productivity (TFP) associated with all input factors (i.e. capital, labor, energy, and material) in a corresponding sector (i.e., petro and chemical manufacturing sectors). The scaling parameter is adjusted to reflect the output losses as shown in Table  2 above. For example, the output loss in the petro products sector for the 33-day shutdown associated with 500-year surge event without coastal protection is estimated at $5.2 billion. This output loss corresponds to a decline in output value in the sector relative to the output value in the BAU scenario. Hence, the scaling parameter associated with TFP for petro products sector is adjusted until the output loss matches the estimated losses as shown in Table 2. Similarly, we adjust the scaling parameter of TFP associated with all input factors for chemical manufacturing sector to match the estimated direct output loss in this sector. Different from the impact of industrial output losses, losses to the dwelling sector directly affect a household's capital endowment in the state. The ratio of property damages to the value of output of the dwelling sector in the CGE BAU scenario for each region is calculated using the dwelling losses reported in Table 2 divided by the value of dwelling output in the BAU scenario. This parameter is then incorporated into the CGE model as a coefficient of capital endowment for households by region. The impacts of storm surge on property damages are modeled as exogenous negative shocks to household capital endowments. The CGE Model is simulated assuming both the dwelling and petro products and chemical manufacturing sectors are impacted simultaneously by surge events; we also consider scenarios when the surge impacts individual sectors such as (i) dwelling and (ii) petro and chemical manufacturing sectors. This exercise allows us to disentangle the economic effects of storm surge from each of the sectors, so as to better understand the sectoral level effects of storm surge. As an extension, the scenarios from storm surge incorporating the SLR in 2080 were also developed. Subsequently, direct impacts were assessed assuming projected growth in housing units and production output growth for petroleum and chemical manufacturing plants. The CGE modeling framework discussed above were adopted to explore regional and national impacts of surge events coupled with the SLR in the year 2080."}, {"section_title": "CGE Model Results", "text": "Storm Surge Impact on Texas and U.S. Economies Storm surge generates substantial economic tolls for Texas Economy as seen throughout by declines in major economic indicators such as GSP, per capita income, welfare, value of output for main economic sectors, value of net export and more.

While the share of damages to GSP is small, it generates substantial decline in the state's major macroeconomic indicators. As reported in Table 5, the state's GSP declines by 7.10% in 2066 if no coastal spine protection is considered, which is mitigated to -2.04% (albeit still indicating a decline) when the coastal spine is factored in damage assessment. Net export (exportimport) falls substantially, initially indicating a sudden decline by 54%. While the gap reduces over time, in 2066 the net export still remains 10% lower than the projected net export in the BAU scenario. Social welfare also declines in the state and is estimated at approximately 7% lower without protection as opposed to 2% with protection, both relative to the BAU in 2066. Both the total consumption and investment will drop notably by approximately 6.5% in 2066. Per capita personal income and government consumption are the only two indicators experiencing positive growth in the state, however income growth is only temporal and lasts for the first decade, after which it starts to decline and remains 2% lower in 2066 relative to the income level in the BAU without a coastal spine.

Source: Authors. In terms of sectoral impacts in the state, the adverse shock of surge events lingers in the long term and as seen in Table 6 negatively impacts production output in all sectors. The largest decline (15.7%) is experienced by the chemical sector, followed by the electricity, other mining, natural gas, oil and coal mining, petro products, and the heat and air conditioning sectors. As output shrinks, the prices rise in these surge-sensitive sectors. While chemical sector experiences largest drop in output value, the prices in the sector rise by only 1.23%; electricity prices are the most responsive to this shock and increase by 5.8%; the prices of petro products also rise by 3% in 2066. Prices increase, albeit modestly by less than 1%, for the sectors directly related to dwelling sector including water and sewage, heat and air conditioning and insurance goods and services sectors (see Table 6a). In terms of employment, our simulation results indicate reduced employment numbers in the majority of the sectors that experience decline in production output. The most sensitive sectors include chemical, petro products, electricity, other mining, and heat and air conditioning. We should also note that while in terms of output all sectors experience decline in 2066 associated with the direct impact of surge on the dwelling sector, employment increases in some of the sectors potentially due to the shift of labor force and the substitution effects. For example, we observe employment growth in forestry, furniture, services, insurances and other agricultural goods relative to the BAU, along with fruits, vegetables and nuts sectors. The coastal spine alleviates the sectoral shock and while all primary sectors grow slower than the projected trajectories in the BAU, the declines in output are less pronounced, as seen in Table 6b.

In Table 7 we report macroeconomic impacts associated with the Ike-like storm surge on Texas economy. There are noticeable differences in terms of the magnitude of effects associated with the 500-year and the Ike-like storms. It is notable that impacts from the no protection scenario of Ike-like storm resembles the impacts from the protection scenario when Texas is struck by the 500-year storm surge. Nonetheless, the Ike-like storm produces adverse impacts on overall state economy. Texas GSP will be 2.6% lower without a coastal spine and only 0.12% lower relative to the BAU scenario when the spine is accounted for in 2066. The immediate effect of the storm on net exports is again pronounced, indicating 20% decline relative to the BAU projected level of this indicator. Over decades these declines shrink and in the year 2066 net exports are estimated 3.8% lower. The coastal spine largely mitigates the impacts of Ike-like storm and while almost all economic indicators fall in 2066 relative to the BAU, the declines are negligible.  Notes: Economic-wide impacts are presented associated with the Ike-like storm surge impact on dwelling sector with and without coastal spine protection. Source: Authors. Sectoral impact associated with Ike-like storm impact on housing are presented in Table 8a and 8b without and with protection. Order of sensitive sectors is consistent with the order of the 500-year storm surge. The difference is in magnitude of impacts. Ike-like storm will result in a decline of chemical sector output by 5.9% without protection and only by 0.27% with coastal spine protection, relative to the BAU. The electricity sector output is the second most impacted, shrinking by 4.45% if no coastal protection is provided. Prices also increase in these storm sensitive sectors, but the rise is relatively small compared to the price responses to the 500-year storm. For example, electricity product prices will be 2% higher in 2066 without coastal protection, and petroleum product prices will increase by only 1%.

In particular, we present results from the scenario when a storm forces 33-day shutdown of plants, translating these shut down days into output losses (i.e., proxying for direct losses to the sector). We should note that under this scenario total direct loss to these sectors is $7.9 billion, 7% lower than the damages sustained in the dwelling sector. This damage figure corresponds to approximately 8% of the total output value of these sectors in Texas in 2016. The impacts on petroleum and chemical manufacturing sectors are relatively smaller within the state as shown by major economic indicators in Texas than the macroeconomic impacts seen through the destruction of the dwelling sector. One explanation is that in the CGE model, damage to the dwelling sector is modeled as a decline in capital endowment to households. Reduced capital affects production output for those sectors that are capital-intensive (e.g. manufacturing sectors) in addition to affecting sectors directly servicing the dwelling (e.g., electricity, heating and gas). This is one of the primary reasons we observe the largest decline in production output in chemical manufacturing and petroleum products locally as a result of housing destruction, followed by the negative output growth in electricity as well as heat and air conditioning. We should also note that capital destruction translates into reduced wage earnings for households who are endowed with factors of production (e.g., capital). On the contrary, output losses to these major industrial sectors are modelled through the reduced total factor productivity parameter related to all factors of production (not only to capital), while assuming the effective capital stock is undamaged. While indirect impacts are relatively smaller in the state, all major macroeconomic indicators still decline relative to the BAU in Texas. Specifically, GSP will be 1.20% lower in 2066 relative to projected GSP in the BAU; personal income also declines by 1%. Social welfare is 0.88% lower and net exports fall by approximately 3% (see panel A of Table 9). These are all without factoring in the mitigating effects of a coastal spine. Impacts are largely mitigated under the protection scenario; declines in major economic indicators are in the range of 0.01-0.03% (Panel B of Table 9).  Notes: Economy-wide impacts are presented associated with the 500-year storm surge impact on petro and chemical manufacturing sectors (resulting in 33-day shutdown of production operation) with and without coastal spine protection. Source: Authors. While impacts reflected on macroeconomic indicators are negligible, sector-specific impacts in the state of Texas indicate that outputs decline and remain low relative to BAU in chemical and petro products sector, along with natural gas, oil and coal mining. Employment also declines in these sectors. Prices are relatively more sensitive to storm surge impacts on these sectors as well (see Table 10a). Specifically, we observe 10% increase in composite prices of the petro products and chemicals relative to those in the BAU. This increase is three times larger than the price increase in the sector when these sectors are indirectly impacted from the shock on the dwelling sector. Prices in all other sectors fall due potentially to substitution effects and shifts in consumption patterns post-surge event. The impacts are largely mitigated with the coastal spine (Table 10b).  Notes: In red are highlighted the top ten most sensitive sectors in terms of the indirect impacts of the direct shock of surge on petro and chemical manufacturing sectors, when plants shut down for 33 days. Source: Authors.  Notes: Table presents  As shown in Table 11, the Texas economy-wide impacts of Ike-like storm on petro and chemical manufacturing sectors are less pronounced. The state GSP will be 0.10% lower in the year 2066, per capita income will decline by 0.08%, and the net export value will fall by 0.24%, all relative to the BAU in 2066. In terms of sectoral impacts, reductions in output and employment are substantially reduced. For example, in terms of the output value, the most sensitive sectors are petroleum (-0.85%), natural gas, oil, and coal mining (-0.5%) and chemical manufacturing (-0.23%). Prices are subsequently less responsive to such insignificant changes in production output. The coastal spine fully mitigates the impacts of surge events on petroleum and chemical manufacturing sectors, assuming the dwelling sector is unaffected.  Economic Impacts when the 500-Year Storm Surge Simultaneously Impacts Petroleum Products, Chemical Manufacturing, and Dwelling Sectors The scenario where dwelling, petro products and chemical manufacturing sectors are all impacted by the storm surge event is the most realistic scenario and shows the full magnitude of changes in the Texas state economy as well as the economies of other states and the entire U.S. Texas' GSP will be approximately 8% lower in 2066, relative to the BAU if no coastal spine protection is considered, and the impact is mitigated to a 2.06% decline with a coastal protection scenario. Furthermore, there is a substantial social welfare loss associated with storm surge, which also lingers over the long-term, indicating a decline of 7.6% without a coastal spine as opposed to a decline by 1.97% when the coastal spine is considered, relative to BAU in 2066. Among major macroeconomic indicators, the largest decline is observed in net export value (export-import). The decline in net export value is due to a rise in prices of goods that are heavily traded intranationally and internationally (e.g., petroleum, chemical products) and further underscores the dependence of the state on these major tradable goods (Table 13). In terms of sectoral impacts in Texas, we should note that all aggregate sectors experience adverse shock due to the 500-year surge events as indicated by declines in output relative to the BAU scenario (Table 14a). The petroleum products and chemical manufacturing sectors are the most sensitive to storm surge events, which is not surprising given these sectors are the primary industries and net exporters of the state economy. Natural resources mining and energy sectors (e.g., electricity and heating) are another two sectors with the largest declines in output value. While the coastal spine does not fully mitigate negative impacts of storm surge events in the long-term, the magnitude of effects on other sectors are four times less than observed if no protection was placed, all relative to the BAU (Table  14b).  The direct and rippling effect through interconnected sectors and intra-, inter-national trade result in about 1.1% loss in U.S. GDP without a coastal spine; the magnitude of impact is mitigated with protection and the GDP decreases by 0.28% in the spine protection scenario. Social w elfare is also lowered by 0.92% relative to the BAU and 0.24% without and with protection, respectively. While Texas experiences a decline in net exports, for the entire nation there is an increase in net exports relative to BAU during the first decade (2017-2026) following a surge event both with and without a protection, which then start to decline in the following decades (Table 15). To translate these percentage changes into actual dollars, in Table 16 we report national and TX values for macroeconomic indicators in the year 2066 in level terms (e.g., GDP, consumption, per capita income, and net export, consumption, investment welfare (in 2016 prices) associated with the three scenarios (i.e. BAU, without coastal protection, and with protection), and corresponding losses relative to the BAU. As for the immediate and the long-term impacts on other states, the model results indicate that while some states (primarily neighboring) experience positive GSP, income and welfare growth due to potential substitution of inputs of production and labor outmigration, 30 states, not including Texas itself, will have a lower GSP in response to a surge event in Texas. Immediate responses as reflected in GSP without the spine system are seen in Figure 5 and are less pronounced than the responses in the year 2066 ( Figure 6). In terms of social welfare, except for handful of states, the majority of the states will experience welfare loss in 2066 if the coastal spine is not constructed (see Figure 7). The spine substantially attenuates effects spatially and in the long term. Figures     Impacts of Ike-like storms as reflected on selected macroeconomic indicators for TX and US are presented in Tables 17 and 18, respectively. Both tables report results without and with coastal protection. Texas GSP declines by 2.7% in 2066, welfare is 2.6% lower, and net export falls by 4% short of that in the BAU if no coastal protection is provided. The nation is almost insulated from the rippling effects of the Ike-like storm on the communities in Galveston Bay in Texas. While in the no protection case the U.S. economy shrinks, the declines are substantially marginal. Notably, the coastal protection almost fully mitigates the impacts on the U.S. economy. This is partially because the petroleum and chemical manufacturing sectors do not sustain damages when coastal spine is factored into direct damage assessment. Responses in terms of GSP, income and welfare across other states in 2066 relative to the BAU are depicted in Appendix C Figures C5-7.    The sectoral impacts of the Ike-like storm in Texas presented in Table 19 show that the chemical sector production value declines by 6% and the outputs of electricity, petroleum, natural gas, oil and coal mining sectors all fall by nearly 4%, without a coastal spine. Prices on petroleum products rise by 1.82% without a coastal protection and electricity sector prices go up by 2%. Impacts are largely mitigated with the coastal spine protection.  "}, {"section_title": "Extension", "text": "Economic Impacts with the Sea Level Rise (SLR) Surge impacts are expected to by exacerbate with the SLR (Frumhoff et al., 2007). To capture the magnifying effects of SLR on Texas and regional economies, as an extension we also simulated the CGE model incorporating the effects of SLR. Specifically, surge inundation maps associated with the different proxy storms incorporating SLR for the year 2080 were generated with the ADCIRC model, which were overlaid with the plant locations to identify the firms that will potentially be inundated under future SLR. To assess damages to residential structures, the inundation maps with the SLR were inputted in the HAZUS-MH model. In the HAZUS-MH model, building counts for different types of dwelling category were updated using the predicted number of housing units in the year 2080. The average value by each dwelling type were then assigned to these projected number of new units to estimate respective losses to dwelling sector in 2080 (see Table 13). In order to assess output losses for the 33-day shutdown of petro products and chemical manufacturing plants we followed the framework described in Section 2.1. Specifically, it was assumed that the number of actively operating plants will be unchanged (i.e., there will not be new entrants in the industry); however, the number of inundated plants increases because the spatial extent of inundation with SLR is much larger. While the effective number of plants were assumed to be unchanged, we assumed that the output produced by each plant will grow at the same annual growth rate as the overall industry growth rate as solved in the BAU scenario. It was also assumed that the output loss in 2080 associated with the SLR will grow at the same rate of the industry output growth rate. In order to project the output losses for the year 2080 under SLR, we first ran the recursive dynamic CGE baseline scenario-the business as usual (BAU) scenario (assuming no SLR) from 2016 to 2080-to obtain the annual output growth rates for the major industries for Texas. Based on the annual outputs solved in the CGE baseline scenario, annual output growth rates were calculated. These annual growth rates were used to compute output losses for the year 2080 respectively for petro products and chemical manufacturing sectors if plants are shut down due to SLR-induced storm surge (output losses for the starting year 2016 and ending year 2080 are presented in Table 14). Incorporating Industry Output Loses and Housing Damages to the CGE Model Similar to the modeling approach discussed throughout, industrial output losses for petroleum products and chemical manufacturing sectors were incorporated into the CGE model by changing scaling parameter associated with total factor productivity. The appropriate scaling parameter was selected until the simulated output losses solved in the CGE model matched the expected losses (as shown in Table 14) for the same year 2080. Similarly, it was assumed that property damages associated with SLR would reduce a household's capital endowment in Texas. The share of the property damage relative to the baseline dwelling value for the state was calculated using the property losses (see Table 13) divided by the dwelling value in the BAU scenario for the year 2080. This parameter was then incorporated into the CGE model as a coefficient to adjust capital endowment for households in Texas due to external shock. We take the 500-year storm (33-day plant shutdown) scenarios under SLR as an example and report impacts for selected economic indicators and for all the states for the year 2080. It should be noted that unlike the model results presented without SLR, the economy-wide impacts under SLR reflect immediate effects only in the year 2080. Results in Table 15 and Table 16, respectively, show economic impacts from output losses in petroleum and chemical manufacturing sectors and impacts from property damages (with protection and without protection). Results from the model where all sectors are simultaneously impacted are shown in Table 17. Compared to the BAU scenario in 2080, Texas GSP declines by approximately 2.3% in 2080 as a result of SLR-induced storm surge impacts without structural protection, for both the scenario when output losses are incorporated (500-year storm) and the scenario when property damages are considered. The impact on the national GDP is also similar between the scenario when output losses are incorporated (-0.384%) and the scenario that captures only property damages (-0.343%). When structural protection is not factored in, the impact on consumption is slightly larger from property damages, while impacts from output losses are larger on per capita income and net exports. Turning to Table 17 which presents results from the model incorporating both industry output losses and property damages under SLR in the year 2080, GSP decreases by 4.5% in Texas without structural protection. The impact is mitigated to -0.63% with protection. Similarly, results suggest that structural protection significantly mitigates negative impacts on consumption, per capita income, and net exports. Although the national impact is generally small, the impacts of SLR-induced storm surge on net exports without protection tend to be larger (-3%), compared to the BAU scenario without SLR in the year 2080.    The main features of the recursive dynamic inter-regional computable general equilibrium (CGE) model used in our analysis and data construction are described in this appendix.

Evaluating the Effects of a Coastal Spine on Flood Insurance Premiums Introduction", "text": "Communities surrounding Galveston Bay have some of the highest flood insurance rates in the nation. Under the 2015 Homeowner Insurance Flood Affordability Act (HIFAA), National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) premiums are being increased up to 18% a year until reaching actuarially-sound rates (FEMA, 2014). On the aggregate, this may be a sound approach to solvency for the NFIP, yet rising flood insurance rates are increasingly felt at the local level, especially in coastal communities with aging populations and infrastructures. Flood defenses, like the proposed coastal spine, may reduce structures' flood risk, effectively removing it from the regulatory floodplain or reducing its flood risk, which may in turn substantially reduce flood insurance costs. With this in mind, our overarching goal is to is to estimate the financial burden of NFIP policies with coastal, surge-based flooding risk in the Houston-Galveston region and determine the range of flood insurance premium savings to homeowners at the local level if a coastal spine was constructed. This study evaluates the potential effects of National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) premiums, including the reduction of flood insurance rates for residents in the Galveston Bay region under 1) existing, baseline conditions and 2) with a coastal spine. We leverage existing Advanced Circulation (ADCIRC) storm surge model outputs to establish flood insurance policy exposure and the corresponding reduction in exposure given a coastal spine. We further demonstrate likely changes in flood insurance rates through two separate approaches under four different scenarios in Harris and Galveston Counties."}, {"section_title": "Background Coastal Texas and Hurricane Ike", "text": "Texas has over 400 miles of coastline that has historically attracted people and industry to take advantage of a multitude of economic opportunities and quality of life amenities (Merrell, Reynolds, Cardenas, Gunn, & Hufton, 2011). In May of each year, coastal Texas residents, communities and businesses prepare for the annual hurricane season, which lasts from June to December. The Texas coastal region has over 4,300 square miles of land vulnerable to flooding induced by hurricane rains and storm surge. The frequency of hurricanes along any 50-mile segment of the coast averages about one storm event every nine years. Annual probabilities of a storm event range from 31% in the Sabine Pass Region to 41% in the Matagorda Region (Roth, 2010). The warm waters of the Gulf enable storms to rapidly grow in size and intensity, substantially increasing their ability to inundate areas with storm surges of 20 feet or higher while causing severe direct flood-related damages and indirect economic effects that linger for years. Texas' most recent large-scale storm surge event occurred in 2008 when Hurricane Ike, the primary catalyst for the proposed \"Ike Dike,\" made landfall on the Texas coast near Galveston Island, causing over $28 billion in damages and 84 deaths (Stoeten, 2013). Ike was followed by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 and preceded by Hurricanes Gustav, Dolly, and Rita, as well as Tropical Storm Eduardo. Each of these storms struck the upper Texas coast within a three-year span. Devastating storms such as Hurricane Ike and Hurricane Harvey have plagued the Texas coast for centuries, claiming thousands of lives and placing overwhelming strains on communities, families, and individuals (Roth, 2010). Hurricane Ike made landfall on the east end of Galveston Island as a category 2 storm in the early morning of September 13, 2008 (see Figure 1). Having decreased in intensity from a category 4 to a category 2 storm along its path over Cuba, many U.S. Gulf Coast residents would not have guessed that, at the time, Ike would be the third-costliest hurricane in U.S. history. Twelve fatalities in Galveston and Chambers Counties are directly attributable to Ike (Berg, 2009). The total financial damage from Ike in Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas is estimated at $24.9 billion, at the time the third costliest storm behind Hurricanes Katrina and Andrew, respectively (Berg, 2009). Despite its maximum sustained winds of 110 mph in the Galveston area, Ike is known more for its immense storm surge. The maximum high-water mark recorded by FEMA was 17.5\u2032, located on Bolivar Peninsula. This surge event caused severe damage to structures and communities on Bolivar Peninsula. Galveston Island did not receive the equivalent surge on the Gulf side, yet its high-water mark values still ranged from 10\u2032 to 13\u2032, the result of a surge that pushed into Galveston and West Bay, forcing water back over the island from the north (bay) side. Hurricane Ike was also unique in the duration of its surge. A forerunner surge arrived late on September 11, marking an early start to rising water in the region (Kraus and Lin, 2009). Storm surge duration for a typical hurricane is less than a day, however Ike's surge lasted 2\u00bd days (Kraus and Lin, 2009). Notably, the elevated area of Galveston Island located behind the seawall incurred less damage, especially compared to areas adjacent to the City of Galveston that were without dune or seawall protection (Kraus and Lin, 2009;Highfield et. al., 2014)."}, {"section_title": "A Brief History of the Coastal Spine", "text": "The \"Ike Dike\" (see Figure 2) is a proposed barrier concept providing coastal protection against damage from hurricane storm surge to the Galveston Bay Area. In 2008, the waves and storm surge produced from Hurricane Ike alone destroyed 60% of homes in affected coastal communities with an estimated property damage cost of $5 billion ($25 billion total) (Davlasheridze, et al., 2016). The most prominent contributing factor to the damage caused by Ike was a storm surge that was able to enter Galveston Bay, where hurricane winds continued to amplify its damaging effect. Twenty lives were lost and Hurricane Ike was still far from the worst-case scenario: had Ike tracked 20-40 miles farther to the southwest, the resulting storm surge in the bay and Houston Ship Channel would have had far greater direct impacts and dramatic implications for local, state, and national economies. The protective barrier being proposed is envisioned as an approximately 100-km long coastal spine along Galveston Island and the Bolivar Peninsula. The spine would connect a series of seawalls and fortified dunes/levees along the coastline to retractable navigation gates located at both the mouth of Galveston Bay and San Luis Pass. The intent is to limit the damaging effects caused by storm surge entering Galveston Bay by blocking a portion of the surge at the coast (Ruijs, 2011). The proposed coastal spine would not only suppress the storm surge, but is also argued to considerably reduce uncertainty in hurricane surge forecasts for the area protected by the spine (Stoeten, 2013), in addition to reducing property losses, decrease precautionary shutdowns, and reduce output losses for industrial plants (Davlasheridze et. al., 2019). The idea is certainly not unique, as comprehensive storm surge protection infrastructure systems have proven effective in protecting coastal communities prone to hurricane storm surge and resultant flooding both in the U.S. and internationally. From a benefit-cost ratio perspective, a coastal spine is economically feasible. The most recent research indicates a 70% reduction for the 500-year surge event, leading to an avoided loss of over $5 billion for residential structures and a total savings of about $12 billion for all occupancy categories. Significant loss reductions are also seen for the 100-year surge event, where damage among all occupancy classes is reduced by over 56%, avoiding almost $6 billion to property damages (Davlasheridze et. al., 2019)."}, {"section_title": "The National Flood Insurance Program", "text": "By far the most comprehensive and widely implemented form of flood mitigation in the United States at the household level takes place through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) (Highfield, Norman and Brody, 2013). The NFIP was established in 1968 to provide flood insurance to floodplain residents and businesses. Although private sector flood insurance is increasingly available to some, the NFIP is still the primary vehicle for providing flood insurance to residents and businesses. At the time of writing, the NFIP has over 29,000 participating communities and over 5.6 million flood insurance policies in force. Risk identification identifies areas that are vulnerable to floods and is used to define levels of risk and determine actuarial rates. The result of this analysis is the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), which contains, among other delineations, the boundaries of the regulatory 1% flood (often referred to as the \"100-year flood\" or base flood). The riverine flood risk is estimated regarding the magnitude of a \"design\" flood or rainfall event (FEMA, 2005). Areas within the 100-year flood boundary have a 1% chance of being reached or exceeded by flood waters in any given year. A combination of hydrologic and hydraulic models are used to estimate the depth and extent of the resulting flood. In comparison to riverine floodplains, floodplain delineation in coastal areas subject to storm surge is a far more complex and uncertain process that relies on simulation models, namely the the hydrodynamic Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model and, more recently, the Advanced Circulation (ADCIRC) model. The dynamic nature of lands influenced by coastal factors requires frequency based on historical storm surges, still water elevation levels, and models of wave generation, setup, overland propagation, run-up, and overtopping. Also, factors such as tides, erosion, and existing structures (e.g., seawalls and other barriers) must also be considered (FEMA, 2017). These outputs, both riverine and coastal, are portrayed on FEMA's FIRMs as the elevation to which floodwater is anticipated to rise during the base flood (i.e., 100-year flood or base flood elevation), (FEMA, 2017). While frequently misconstrued as the measure of flood risk, FIRMs are created for the purpose represented by their namesake: to set flood insurance rates. FIRMs are divided into zones which broadly determine the probabilistic flood risk for the area delineated. Moderate-and low-risk areas are denoted by B-, C-or X-zone designations (see Table 1). Areas designated as X-zones are judged to be low flood risk and carry flood insurance premiums (usually preferred risk policies) of approximately $450 dollars per year, assuming there is no previous history of flood damage. Shaded Xzones are areas that are considered low to moderate risk due to protection by levees or other structural features. Shaded X-zones premiums are typically near the preferred risk policy cost. Flood zones AE and VE are considered high-risk, and correspond to what is commonly referred to as the 100-year flood, or areas which have a 1% chance in any year of encountering a flood. Zone AE is the traditional 100-year or 1% flood zone, while zone VE carries the same flood probability but with the addition of wave action resulting from storm surge. Insurance costs in AE and VE flood zones carry higher annual premiums with much more variability, depending on the age, foundation type and elevation of the structure. For example, in Harris and Galveston counties, the average flood insurance premium for structures located in the AE-zone is $905 per year. This value is, however, highly variable (standard deviation $1013); structures built prior to the establishment of FIRMs (pre-FIRM) have premiums of nearly $1000, while structures built after the establishment of the FIRM (post-FIRM, and assumed to a higher standard) have an average annual premium of $795. Structures built in VE-zones, and thus subject to storm surge carry even higher premiums. The average flood insurance premium of VE rated structures is $1083, with average pre-FIRM VE rates of $1440 and average post-FIRM VE rates of $900. Area of moderate flood hazard, usually the area between the limits of the 100-year and 500-year floods.

The study areas in these two counties represent the primary impact of the proposed coastal spine as they will be directly affected by its construction and potential flood mitigation effects, while containing nearly all impacted NFIP policies. In order to determine our study area, we relied upon two datasets: NFIP policies from 2014 (the most recent available) and ADCIRC flood inundation outputs. We first calculated the difference in flood inundation from two ADCIRC runs that simulate a 100-year surge event: one modeled run that allows surge to impact the study area unimpeded from any barrier, and one that takes into account a 17' storm surge barrier as shown in Figure  2 above. The 100-year event was selected since current regulatory flood insurance policy uses this recurrence interval as the regulatory trigger for insurance purchase. NFIP policies were then spatially joined to the two ADCIRC runs, creating measures that provided estimated surge inundation with and without the presence of a coastal spine. Any NFIP policy located in an area that demonstrated a decrease in surge height was included for further analysis, effectively isolating only policies impacted by a coastal spine.

These four scenarios represent the most likely changes in NFIP policy ratings should a coastal spine be constructed and certified to protect against a 100-year surge event. To determine changes in flood insurance costs with a coastal spine in place, we used these four scenarios of potential NFIP ratings changes to compare against the \"baseline\" rates-those rates that are observed in the dataset without any modification. The first scenario is the most conservative and risk-averse. In this scenario, we assume that V-zone rated policies that experience a decrease in the 100-year surge to 1' or less as a result of the coastal spine shift from V-zones to A-zones. This scenario keeps existing policies in the high-risk flood category, but removes the threat of coastal wave action if surge water levels are less than 1'. All other zones remain unchanged (see Table 2). The second scenario takes a slightly more lenient but still quite conservative approach to NFIP zone changes. In this scenario, V-zone rated NFIP policies in locations that have had 100-year surge levels reduced to zero inundation are shifted into shaded X zones-flood zones which are considered moderate risk due to structural mitigation features. No other policy rate changes are made. In our third scenario, we begin to shift two zones. First, and similar to the first scenario, V-zone rated policies that have 1' or less as of surge with the spine in place are shifted from the V-zone to the A-zone. Second, we now also shift A-zone policies into the shaded X-zone if the A-zone policy location has a surge reduction to zero feet. This scenario is an expansion of Scenario 1, with the assumption that the A-to shaded X-zone shift also represents a reduction in coastal flooding in areas that were previously not expected to have wave action. The fourth and final scenario is perhaps the most liberal of the four. First, we shift V-zone rated policies to the A-zone if the policy location experienced a reduction in surge depth of less than one foot-the same approach taken in scenarios 1 and 3. Next, we shift A-zone rated policies that show complete protection (surge reduction to zero feet) from 100-year surge events with a coastal spine into low-risk, or X-zone ratings. This second shift is conceptually different from movement of policies into the shaded X-zone. However, our dataset has far more X-zone rated policies than shaded X rated policies, providing more variability in cost estimates."}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis", "text": "Building on the four flood insurance rate change scenarios outlined above, we then analyzed data through two approaches. The first approach simply uses the mean policy premium for each flood zone to substitute changes in flood insurance premiums as a result of a coastal spine reducing storm surge policy ratings. For example, a pre-coastal spine V-zone rated policy that exhibits a surge reduction of less than one foot may after the coastal spine may have its rating shifted to the A-zone. In this case, we subtract the mean V-zone policy premium from the total of all V-zone rated policies, and add an A-zone rated policy at its mean value, increasing the total of all A-zone rated policy premiums. The advantage of this spatial analysisdriven mean-substitution method is that it retains all of the raw flood insurance premium values-no modeling errors are introduced. The disadvantage, however, is that the mean-substitution approach only takes into account the flood zone location of the policy, it does not consider many of the characteristics used to assess or that drive flood insurance rates. To address this shortcoming, we also took a second, statistical regression-based approach to estimate changes in flood insurance premiums. For this second approach, we measured a suite of variables to predict annual flood insurance premiums by estimating Ordinary Least-Squares regression models. First, we started with the dependent variable, flood insurance premiums, which was measured to the whole dollar and represents the total amount paid per year for flood insurance. This variable was further logtransformed to approximate a Gaussian distribution. Second, we measured a host of independent variables under the categories of cost factors, discounts, elevation and flood zones (see Table 3). The cost factors examined consisted of the total replacement cost and total insurance coverage. The total replacement cost is a whole dollar estimate of the value of the insured building as provided by the insurance policy. The total coverage is the total of building and content coverage, and varies from the replacement coverage due to the maximum coverage amounts allowed by the NFIP. For a residential policy, the NFIP caps building coverage at $250,000 and contents coverage at $100,000, non-residential building and contents coverage is capped at $500,000 for each coverage type. Both total coverage and total replacement values were calculated and log-transformed before entering the model. There are also several elements that can reduce insurance premiums. The variables examined in this category included the policies' CRS participation level, the elevation status of the building, and the policy's pre-FIRM status. The CRS level refers to the Community Rating System (CRS), which is a voluntary incentive program that recognizes and encourages community floodplain management activities that exceed the minimum NFIP requirements. The greater the CRS class, the greater the insurance premium discount will be, up to a maximum of 45%. We included the CRS scores of each policy as a series of indicator variables, ranging from no discount (non-participating) to a 25% discount, the maximum in the study area. Elevated buildings are also rated at a discount relative to slab-on-grade construction. An elevated building is defined by FEMA as, \"a building that has no basement and that has its lowest elevated floor raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear walls, posts, piers, pilings, or columns.\" The elevation status of each policy (yes/no) was entered into the model as an indicator variable. The pre-FIRM status also drives individual flood insurance rates. A pre-FIRM is structure is defined by FEMA as \"a building for which construction or substantial improvement occurred on or before December 31, 1974, or before the effective date of an initial Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).\" In other words, structures that were built prior to the development or implementation of the flood insurance mapping and rating system. Policies rated as pre-FIRM were entered into the model as an indicator variable. The elevation of a structure is also an important determinant of a flood insurance rate. Typically, this form of elevation is measured as the first-floor elevation (FFE). The FFE in relation to the base flood elevation on a FIRM is critical to understanding how much, if any, water will be taken on by a structure in the event of a flood of a given height. Unfortunately, values of FFE are difficult if not impossible to obtain as FFEs are determined by a surveyor and recorded on an elevation certificate; many structures have not been surveyed, and no database of elevation certificates exists. As a proxy, we incorporated the Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) into the model (Liu et. al., 2018). While not a true FFE, the HAND does provide an elevation more accurate for flood impacts than traditional ground elevation and is roughly equivalent to FFE for most slab-on-grade structures. HAND values were previously calculated by and downloaded from the National Flood Interoperability Experiment (https://web.corral.tacc.utexas.edu/nfiedata/). Each NFIP policy was spatially joined to its HAND elevation, and each policy's HAND elevation value was entered into the model. The primary variables of interest, flood zones, were allocated to each flood insurance policy. The most recent effective flood insurance rate maps for our study area were downloaded and spatially merged from the FEMA Map Service Center. Each flood insurance policy was then spatially joined to the merged FIRMs to determine its floodplain zone designation. The zones included in our analysis are described above in Table 1. Finally, we also included fixed-effects for community membership based on the FEMA community definition, to control for any additional mitigation activities that may occur at the community level and other unobserved heterogeneity. The regression-based analysis was performed on the same sub-set of policies that demonstrated a decrease in storm surge reduction. An initial regression model was estimated using the variables described above, and baseline flood insurance rates were predicted from this model. Following the baseline prediction, we then substituted observations into different flood zones using the factors described in the four scenarios, and predicted flood insurance premiums for each scenario."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "\nResults are presented for four different aspects of the increased flood risk which results from omission of a western section of the coastal spine: 1) surge forerunner propagation through an un-gated San Luis Pass, 2) increase in peak surge elevation and inundation in both West and Galveston Bays caused by storm surge outflanking the western end of the coastal spine in the USACE Alternative A, 3) influence of sea level rise on increased peak surge and inundation associated with flanking, and 4) relative merits of the eastern and western dike sections in suppressing propagation of the coastal storm surge into the bays. Each of these four aspects are briefly discussed in separate sections below. A number of figures are utilized to illustrate the adverse impacts on flood risk throughout the Houston-Galveston region that arise from omission of the western section."}, {"section_title": "Descriptive", "text": "The results of our initial spatial analysis of NFIP policies indicated that 31,411, or 10% of all NFIP policies in Harris and Galveston Counties, would experience a reduction in 100-year storm surge as a result of a coastal spine (see Figure 4). These policies are all located in areas that are directly adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico, Galveston Bay, or along Clear Lake/Creek and the Houston Ship Channel. The 31,411 NFIP policies that will experience some level of storm surge reduction represent over $41 million dollars in annual premiums borne by residents, with total coverage of over $8 billion dollars without protection. Over 72% of affected policies occur in the A-zone, which has an annual policy premium of $1,167, accumulates over $26 million dollars per year in premiums and has total flood insurance coverage of $5.7 billion dollars. The other high-risk flood zone, the V-zone, has 4,919 policies that will experience some level of surge protection, with a mean annual policy premium of $2,719, over $13 million in annual flood insurance premiums and nearly $1.3 billion dollars of flood insurance coverage. The remaining moderate-and low-risk zones, including the 500-year, shaded X and X-zones, account for the remaining 3,799 NFIP policies that would experience a reduction in storm surge. Even these low-risk flood zones account for $1.8 million in annual flood insurance premiums and have $1.1 billion in covered assets. Mean annual policy premiums for these zones range from a high of $526 in the 500-year flood zone to $326 in the shaded X zone (see Table 4). The reduction inundation from a coastal-spine protected 100-year surge for NFIP policies is variable, both overall and across zones (see Table 5), but follows the risk structure of existing flood zones. The largest average change in mean inundation is for policies located in V-zones, with a mean decrease of nearly 7' which affects nearly 5,000 policies. This result is not surprising, as these policies are located in areas most at risk from storm surge. Policies in the A-zone sees the second-most decrease in mean storm surge at 4.45' and again reflect areas which would have experienced rising water in the event of a storm surge, but without (or with reduced) wave action. The largest impact in affected policies comes from this zone, with 22,693 NFIP policies benefitting from a reduction in storm surge. The third flood zone in order of flood risk is the 500-year flood zone, which is also ranked third in mean storm surge reduction at 2.2' and affects over 1,800 polices. The final two zones of low flood risk, the shaded X zone (23 policies) and the X-zone (1,813 policies), show minimal decreases in mean storm surge reduction at 0.66' and 2.2', respectively. "}, {"section_title": "Scenario Results", "text": "Although the above sheds some light on the level of NFIP policy premiums and asset exposure that may be changed with a coastal spine in place, more spatially-explicit results were calculated based on the four scenarios outlined in Table 2 using two approaches: mean-substitution and regression-based. The meansubstitution approach retains the raw annual policy premiums, shifting policies from one flood zone to another based on the reduction in storm surge. When a policy changes flood zones, the mean premium for the original flood zone is subtracted from the total premium for that zone, and the mean premium for the new, or \"protected,\" flood zone is added to the total premium for that zone. The results of the four scenarios are then compared to the baseline, or unprotected, flood insurance figures. As previously noted, the mean substitution approach has a disadvantage in that it only takes into account the flood zone location of the policy, and does not consider any of the other characteristics used to assess flood insurance rates. This limitation was addressed through the use of a statistical regression-based approach to estimate changes in flood insurance premiums. The estimated regression model described above achieved an adjusted R 2 of 0.49. All independent variables described above in Table 3 behaved as expected and were significant at p < 0.001 (see Appendix A). Regression diagnostics did not yield any significant violations. It should be noted, however, that the model's baseline prediction underpredicted the raw premium values by approximately 50%. This was not wholly unexpected, as model fits of this type of data are notoriously difficult and do not yield high R 2 values. While this is not ideal for comparing the aggregate policy premiums predicted from the regression model to the raw, mean-substitution premiums, the percent-changes from the scenarios analyzed with the regression-based approach are still informative when compared to the predicted regression baseline and percent-changes calculated in the meansubstitution approach."}, {"section_title": "Scenario 1", "text": "In this conservative scenario, V-zone rated policies that experience a decrease in the 100-year surge to 1' or less were shifted from V-zones to A-zones. Notably, this scenario keeps all policies, regardless of their change in flood zone, in a high-risk flood category. Under this scenario with mean-substitution, 3,184 (65%) of NFIP policies in the V-zone are protected to less than 1' of storm surge and shifted into the traditional 100-year flood zone (A-zone) without wave action. This scenario results in nearly $5 million dollars in annual flood insurance savings to homeowners, a 13.45% reduction (see Table 6) from the baseline. Comparatively, the regression-based approach resulted in a comparatively similar reduction of 12.35% compared to baseline (see Table 7)."}, {"section_title": "Scenario 2", "text": "Scenario 2 shifts V-zone rated NFIP policies in locations that have had 100-year surge levels reduced to zero feet of inundation into shaded X-zone rated policies, or ratings intended for moderate-risk areas due to structural mitigation features such as levees and dams. The calculated changes using mean-substitution under this second scenario show that 2,619 (53%) V-zone polices are fully protected from storm surge as a result of the coastal spine, which shifted the same amount into shaded X-zone policies with an average annual policy premium of $326. In the aggregate, this resulted in $6.2 million dollars per year in savings for annual premiums, a 17.7% reduction compared to the baseline (see Table 6). The regression-based estimates for Scenario 2 yielded a 12.42% reduction (see Table 7)."}, {"section_title": "Scenario 3", "text": "The third scenario shifts policies into two zones: V-zone policies that had 1' or less of surge with a coastal spine were shifted to the A-zone, while A-zone policies that had a surge reduction to 0' were moved into the shaded X-zone.

The overall effect of these policy re-ratings decreases the total annual policy premium by nearly $14 million dollars, or a 49% decrease in total annual premiums (see Table 6). This was the highest reduction of all scenarios across both methods. The regression-based estimated reduction was 28.81%, still over double that of the previous two scenarios, but not nearly as ambitious as the mean-substituted reduction (see Table 7)."}, {"section_title": "Scenario 4", "text": "The fourth scenario follows the same decision logic as Scenario 3, except A-zone rated policies that show complete protection from 100-year surge events are moved into the X-zone (as opposed to the shaded Xzone).

This scenario yields the same 3,184 policy reduction in the V-zone, decreases A-zone policies by 51%, and adds 14,189 policies to the X-zone. In total, Scenario 4 decreases annual total flood insurance premiums by $7.4 million dollars, a 21.8% reduction (see Table 6).

Currently, policyholders that would be affected by a coastal spine spend over $40 million dollars on flood insurance annually. Results of our initial spatial analysis show that over 31,000 NFIP policy holders would experience a reduction in storm surge from a coastal spine, a number that has likely increased following Hurricane Harvey with its renewed sense of flood risk driving flood insurance policy purchases. Based on their proximity to the coast, V-zone policies show the largest decrease in inundation, yet over 22,000 A-zone polices also have reduced storm surge levels. All told, our analysis indicates that $8 billion dollars of NFIP insurance coverage would have reduced surge risk with a coastal spine. Additional scenario-based analysis extended the specificity of these estimates and provided probable ranges of flood insurance reductions. Based on our analysis, even the most conservative estimates provide substantial insurance savings to coastal residents on annual basis. Scenarios 1 and 2, which only affect high-risk flood zones with wave action, still decrease annual insurance costs by 12-17%, a consistent figure across both estimation approaches. Scenarios 3 and 4, which provide the same level of protection for high-risk flood zones with wave action, but also extend to more traditional flood zones, showed higher reductions, realistically ranging from 21-28% per year. The probability of each of these scenarios coming to fruition should a coastal spine be constructed is difficult to judge. Scenarios 1 and 2 are likely the most feasible, as they do not affect any existing high-risk flood zones, but remove the threat of wave action. Scenarios 3 and 4 are not unrealistic, but they are na\u00efve with respect to riverine and pluvial flooding that may still occur in A-zones. Given the proximity of the A-zones analyzed to coastal waters, storm surge threats are likely the most probable cause of flooding, but other freshwater sources may still be present. On the whole, the most likely scenario is a mix of the four provided in our analysis. One important aspect that needs to be considered is that each of the four scenarios will still allow residents to retain flood insurance at the same coverage level. In fact, our analysis assumes that each current policy holder renews their policies, with some benefitting from lower annual premiums as a result of decreased storm surge. Although the purchase flood insurance is one important characteristic of flood mitigation and resilience, there will undoubtedly be a decrease in flood insurance take-up rates should high-risk 100-year flood zones get re-zoned to moderate and lower risk flood zones. In this case, the mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements for residents in A-and V-zones with federally-backed mortgages would no longer apply, some proportion of policies would lapse, and the flood insurance premium savings would be 100%.  (FEMA, 2008). Property damages associated with the storm are estimated at $30 billion, making Ike the 6 th costliest U.S. tropical cyclone on record (NOAA, 2018). The broader economic impact of Ike, in the eight county region of Texas most affected by the storm, is estimated to be $142 billion in losses (TEEX, 2009). The severe destruction caused by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 is a reminder that coastal communities in Texas remain at risk. Harvey was largely a rainfall event, but it is a stark reminder that storm surge could devastate communities and cripple the state and national economies. More than 500,000 Texas homes are at risk of storm surge damage in the event of a Category 5 hurricane (CoreLogic, 2018). Approximately 25% of the nation's petroleum and more than half of its jet fuel is processed by refineries around the Galveston Bay (Scranton, 2016), and an environmental disaster in the form of millions of gallons of spilled oil and chemicals is possible (Graham, 2017). The risk coastal Texas faces, however, can be mitigated. The proposed coastal barrier system would protect coastal communities and restore essential ecosystem functioning to reduce risk. What do Texans think of these plans? What are their policy preferences and attitudes? This chapter summarizes the methodology and findings of a survey, conducted May through July 2017, of residents in the three county area most invested in the coastal barrier system: Chambers, Galveston, and Harris Counties."}, {"section_title": "Survey Sample and Methods", "text": "To assess the public's perceptions of coastal protection and mitigation strategies, a survey was designed by the Center for Texas Beaches and Shores researchers and administered by the Public Policy Research Institute at Texas A&M University. 1 The survey was administered by phone May 11 through July 16, 2018 and online August 24 through September 27, 2018 to residents in Chambers, Galveston, and Harris Counties. This area was chosen as it is the region most affected by the proposed coastal spine (see Figure  1). According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 4.76 million people live in these three counties. A total of 2,300 surveys were completed, including 805 phone interviews and 1,495 online surveys. 2 The phone interviews included 142 responses from Chambers County, 251 from Galveston County, and 412 from Harris County. A total of 90.7% of the respondents (N=730) took the survey via cell phone while 9.3% (N=75) took the survey on a landline phone. Of the 805 interviews completed, 32 were conducted in Spanish. Due to availability of respondents, the online survey was conducted only in Harris and Galveston Counties. A total of 365 online surveys were completed by Galveston County residents, and 1,130 surveys were completed by Harris County residents."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "The phone survey sample was probabilistic, using random digital dialing, and the online survey sample was quota-based, drawn from a panel of respondents provided by Qualtrics. 3 The phone survey sample was selected using dual frame sampling, which includes landline random digital dialing telephone and cell phone samples. According to the most recent estimates available from the National Health Interview Survey, 52% of adults are now wireless only (2017), meaning that they do not have a landline phone. An additional 15% of the population is wireless-mostly, meaning they accept most or all of their calls on their cell phones. This sampling strategy takes into account these broader technological shifts and assures a representative sample of the local population. The phone survey response and cooperation rates, calculated using Formula 4 from American Association of Public Opinion research, were 5.3% and 22.8%, respectively. The response rate of the survey was 5.3%, meaning 5.3% of all calls to eligible respondents resulted in a completed survey. The cooperation rate was 22.8%, meaning that 22.8% of the calls made actually made contact with an eligible respondent and resulted in a completed interview. Low response rates on cell phone samples are largely expected as it is increasing difficult to contact potential respondents. The cooperation rate is in the range of what might be expected on this type of survey. The online survey sample matched available Qualtrics panel participants with U.S. Census Bureau data for age, race/ethnicity, and education. 4 Quota-based surveys are increasingly being used to reach participants online. While participation is improved, the reliance on quota sampling, rather than random sampling, means it is not possible to calculate margins of error for the data that provide a measure of precision. However, nonprobability, quota-based surveys offer valid measurements if sample selection and weighting make adjustments that create a representative sample (Kennedy et al., 2016). Steps have been taken in this study, pre and post survey administration, to adjust the online sample to make it representative of the population of Harris and Galveston Counties. The phone survey data were weighted to approximate the most recently available population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau. For these data, estimates from the 2016 American Community Survey for the adult population (18 years and over) in Harris, Galveston, and Chambers Counties were used. The sample weight is calculated by taking the inverse of the probability that an individual respondent would have been selected in the final sample. This weight is based on the population of the county divided by observed sample within the county. In addition, the weight is \"raked\" iteratively to adjust sample estimates to population estimates on education, race, and age. The phone survey weight results are provided in Appendix B. Additionally, a weight to apply to the merged phone and online survey data was created using accepted techniques for combining probability and nonprobability samples (Mercer et al., 2017). First, the probability (phone) and non-probability (online) samples were merged into the same data file. Second, a logistic regression predicting membership in the non-probability sample was conducted. Third, the inverse of the probability was used to create initial weights for the non-probability sample. Fourth, the data was weighted, or \"raked,\" to match population estimates for each county. The combined weight results are provided in Appendix C. All analyses of these data, as presented in this chapter, include the combined weight so that the sample statistics are generalizable and representative of the tri-county area surveyed."}, {"section_title": "Disaster Experience Across Survey Sample", "text": "The coastal communities selected for this study have experienced multiple natural disasters in the past decade. Survey respondents were asked to indicate if they experienced negative impacts to their property, finances, and health due to Hurricane Ike.

As shown in Figure 2, the majority of the survey sample responded that they had experienced damages from either or both Hurricanes Ike and Harvey. "}, {"section_title": "Coastal Mitigation in Texas", "text": "Coastal communities face multiple natural hazards that put people and property at risk. Hurricane force winds, storm surge, and flooding present sudden onset hazards. Coastal flooding, in particular, is the most costly, disruptive, and life-threatening hazard, whose negative impacts are only increasing. A recent study estimates that more than 500,000 Texas homes are at risk of storm surge damage in the event of a Category 5 hurricane (CoreLogic, 2018). Sea level rise and beach erosion, particularly of the upper Texas Coast in the area of Galveston Bay and Galveston Island, also threaten commercial and residential areas as they alter the ecosystem services provided by the environment and pose flooding threats (Yoskowitz et al., 2017;Ravens and Khairil, 2007). To mitigate the risk coastal communities in Texas face, both structural and non-structural strategies have been pursued. Structural mitigation can be found across the tri-county area in the form of jetties, groins, and levees. The most recognizable is the seawall constructed in Galveston Island after the 1900 Hurricane that protects approximately nine miles of the east end of the island (Hansen, 2007). Non-structural mitigation features environmental alterations or policies that reduce risk. These include dune and beach restoration projects across Galveston and Bolivar Peninsula as well as marsh restorations around the Galveston Bay. This also entails policies to regulate land use. As shown in Figure 3, the survey assessed public support for a range of protective features and strategies intended to reduce natural hazard risk to coastal communities. These represent both structural and nonstructural strategies, including some of the features being studied by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in partnership with the Texas General Land Office, as part of a comprehensive plan to protect and sustain the coast. 5 Of the eight strategies assessed, the most support was observed for property elevation (85.44%), elevated infrastructure (81.70%), seawalls and levees (81.16%), and conservation of wetlands (80.50%). Another 77.23% expressed support for rehabilitation of sand dunes. 6 Nearly 30% of respondents opposed zoning ordinances, and 28.62% did not support home buy-outs. 7 An additional 24.5% also opposed the use of retention basins. Support for mitigation strategies varied among the three counties sampled, as shown in Table 1. The environmental strategies, including sand dune rehabilitation and conservation of wetlands, were most supported in Chambers and Galveston Counties with about 8-in-10 respondents saying they \"support some\" or \"support a lot\" these measures. Slightly less -about 7-in-10 -respondents from Harris County support sand dune rehabilitation. There was also variance in seawall support with nearly 85% of Galveston County respondents supporting this protective strategy, compared to 81% of Chambers and Harris County respondents. Note: Percentage of respondents that answers \"support some\" and \"support a lot\" is reported for each county sampled; the values for \"range\" represent the difference between the highest and lowest support. Source: Authors. It is notable that the majority -over 70% of respondents -in Chambers, Galveston, and Harris Counties supported all of the strategies posed. This demonstrates widespread buy-in to take initiatives, across the public and private sectors, aimed at protecting communities and restoring coastal ecosystems."}, {"section_title": "Support for the Coastal Spine", "text": "Since the \"Ike Dike\" was proposed, it has drawn both support and criticism from experts, elected representatives, policymakers, and the general public. No polls, to our knowledge, have systematically assessed public awareness or support for the coastal barrier system. The survey asked respondents questions to evaluate both awareness and support. Survey respondents were asked: \"Before today, have you heard of the Texas coastal spine or Ike Dike?\" Overall, 71.82% replied \"no\", 22.78% said \"yes\", and 5.4% replied \"don't know\". Lack of awareness was highest in Chambers County with 74.17% saying they had not heard of the Ike Dike. Knowledge of the coastal spine was highest among Galveston County respondents with 35.25% saying they have heard of the coastal spine. In Harris County, only 21.84% of respondents said they were aware of the Ike Dike. Given this widespread lack of awareness, all respondents were read the following description of the coastal spine: Texas leaders are considering the construction of a coastal spine. Also known as the \"Ike Dike,\" the coastal spine would connect a series of sea walls and sand dune barriers along Galveston Island's coastline to a retractable gate located on Galveston Bay. Geographically, Galveston Bay connects the Houston-Galveston area to the Gulf of Mexico. In the event of a major hurricane, the coastal spine will protect the Houston-Galveston region from a potentially devastating storm surge. Following the description of the Ike Dike, support for it was assessed by the question: \"How much do you support or oppose the construction of a coastal spine in Texas?\" As shown in Figure 4, the overwhelming majority expressed support for the Ike Dike. Respondents from Galveston and Harris County were most supportive with 73.52% and 73.05%, respectively, saying they \"somewhat support\", \"support\", or \"strongly support\" the coastal barrier system. In comparison, 69.17% of respondents support the Ike Dike in Chambers County. Chambers County residents demonstrated the biggest divides on the issue. Respondents in Chambers County expressed the strongest support and strongest opposition: 11.63% of Chambers County respondents were \"strongly opposed\" to the Ike Dike while 38.44% were \"strongly supportive\". Only 3.60% and 5.96% of Harris and Galveston County respondents, respectively, were \"strongly opposed\". Notably, Harris County respondents were the most ambivalent about the issue: 17.61% said they \"neither oppose or support\" the construction of the coastal spine. Only 12.96% and 13.4% of Galveston and Chambers County respondents, respectively, said the same. "}, {"section_title": "Support for Specific Features of the Coastal Spine", "text": "In addition to generalized support for the Ike Dike, specific features that have been proposed to comprise a larger coastal barrier system were also evaluated among a subset of the phone survey respondents (n=400). These features included the extension of the seawall, proposed to expand the current wall east along Bolivar Peninsula and west to the San Luis Pass. Also evaluated was support for a large retractable gate at Galveston Bay, a small navigation gate at Clear Lake, and a ring levee to surround the East End of Galveston Island. Support for raised coastal highways and sand dunes, proposed along Galveston Island and Bolivar Peninsula, was also assessed. Support for specific coastal barrier system features is reported in Figure 5. Raised coastal highways and sand dunes garnered \"a lot\" of support from 50.79% and 43.27% of respondents, respectively. Over 35% of respondents expressed \"a lot\" of support for the large retractable gate at Galveston Bay (35.06%) and the small navigation gate at Clear Lake (37.32%). Less than one-in-three respondents said they support \"a lot\" the ring levee around Galveston Island (29.70%) or extending the Galveston seawall from High Island to San Luis Pass (27.00%). Notably, a sizable proportion of respondents said they \"don't know\" about the ring levee (30.35%) and seawall extension (40.34%), indicating lack of awareness of these strategies. Opposition was most prevalent for the gates: 12.45% and 12.49% of respondents said they \"do not support\" the large retractable gate at Galveston Bay and the navigation gate at Clearlake. Chambers County respondents were particularly opposed -26.21% of Chambers County respondents, compared to 13.09% of Galveston County respondents and 12.02% of Harris County respondents, said they \"do not support\" the large retractable gate at Galveston Bay. Respondents from Galveston County were the most opposed to the navigation gate at Clearlake with 14.82% saying they \"do not support\" the strategy. In sum, survey responses indicate widespread support, but also lack of awareness of, the Ike Dike. Specific features of the coastal barrier system did not garner as much support, suggesting that there may be knowledge gaps, perceived competing interests (i.e., gate at Galveston Bay versus Clear Lake), and divisions among subgroups of the community that oppose and support specific features. The map shown in Figure 6 demonstrates that support for the coastal spine, while generally high, is variant across the counties surveyed. More research is needed to assess this variance. "}, {"section_title": "Risk Perceptions Linked to Support for Coastal Spine", "text": "A preliminary analysis was conducted to explore the connection between support for the construction of a coastal spine and natural hazard risk perceptions. A number of research studies have found that risk perception is a major predictor of adoption of various types of hazard adjustments. 8 Risk perception, defined as \"people's expectations about the probability of the occurrence of an extreme environmental event of a specific intensity at a particular place within a given period of time\" (Lindell, 2013), indicates perceived danger of personal consequences due to natural hazards. Consistent with past research (Brody et al., 2017), the survey measured risk as perceived personal damages from a severe flood in the next ten years. A risk perception factor score was created from a set of five survey questions that asked respondents to indicate the likelihood a flood in the next ten years will cause: 1) major damage to property in your city; 2) deaths and injuries to people in your community; 3) major damage to your home; 4) disruption to your job that prevents you from working; and 5) disruption of electrical, telephone, and other basic services. 9 As shown in Figure 7, risk perceptions (averaged by zip code) varied considerably across the Chambers, Galveston, and Harris Counties. A bivariate ordered logistic regression was estimated to assess the effect of risk perceptions on support for construction of the coastal spine. 10 Risk perception was a significant predictor of support (p=0.000). Based on the regression estimates, the predicted probability of support and opposition is shown in Figure  8 (predicted probabilities are shown as dots and 95% confidence intervals as bars). The predicted probabilities indicate that an individual with the lowest perceived risk has a 12.58% likelihood of expressing strong support for the Ike Dike; in contrast, an individual with the highest perceived risk has a 44.37% of the same. The results show that as flood risk perceptions increase, strong support for construction of the coastal spine increases. This preliminary analysis demonstrates that flood risk perceptions are driver of support for the construction of the coastal spine. It is limited, however, in that it does not measure other risk perceptions relevant to coastal communities (i.e., storm surge) or control for the various factors that may influence opinions on the issue. Future research should more comprehensively analyze the individual correlates of support for the Ike Dike, including disaster experience, political ideology, homeownership, distance to the coast, and socioeconomic status."}, {"section_title": "Perceptions of Financng the Coastal Spine", "text": "Financing large scale infrastructure projects requires public buy-in. To assess the perceptions residents of Chambers, Galveston, and Harris Counties hold about financing the proposed coastal spine, respondents were asked if government on various levels or industry should be responsible for paying for the coastal spine. As shown in Figure 9, 55.48% of respondents expressed that both government and port industries should finance the proposed structure, while 19.42% and 17.68% held federal and state government, respectively, responsible. Responses across the three counties sample demonstrated little variance, with the exception that more respondents in Chambers and Galveston Counties indicated government and industry should be jointly responsible: 64.33% and 62.08%, respectively, said both parties should finance the construction of the coastal spine. Since taxes are often used to pay for public infrastructure projects like the coastal spine, respondents were asked to express preference for taxes to raise revenue for the construction of the coastal spine. Specifically, respondents were asked what type of tax they would support. Response options included: \"property taxes\", \"sales tax\", \"hotel tax\", \"a new tax for this purpose\", \"a mix of these\", and \"I don't support any taxes for this purpose\". Responses are shown in Table 2. A third of respondents indicated they do not support taxes to raise revenue for the coastal spine. Nearly an additional third expressed that they support a mix of property, sales, hotel, and/or new tax to support the coastal spine. Preferences for property, sales, and hotel taxes to raise revenue for the coastal spine were mixed across the three counties. Sales tax was most preferred by Harris County respondents (9.67%) while hotel tax was preferred the most by Galveston County respondents (8.71%). Property taxes were supported by 9.36% of Harris County respondents; only 4.74% and 6.55% of Galveston and Chambers County respondents, respectively, supported property taxes to finance the coastal spine."}, {"section_title": "Perception of Consequences of the Coastal Spine", "text": "The primary reason for building the coastal spine is to protect the three counties that lie behind it from a storm surge event. Over 575,000 people live in low-lying areas adjacent to Galveston Bay (U.S. Census Bureau, 2017). The Bay area has a robust economy based on aerospace, petrochemical, and maritime industries. It is home to the largest petrochemical complex in the U.S. and the second largest in the world. The refineries along the coast are responsible for approximately half of the nation's petrochemical manufacturing and approximately one-third of the nation's petroleum refining and processing capacity. This sector employs over 15,000 people and contributes approximately $6 billion to the local economy through taxes, payrolls, purchases and capital expenditures. In addition, there are three thriving ports in the Bay Area: the Port of Houston, the Port of Texas City, and the Port of Galveston. These ports contribute a total of $277.6 billion in economic activity to the state of Texas, and ship channel-related businesses generate over one million jobs throughout Texas. The region also has the nation's third largest marina, comprised of over 7,000 recreational boat slips, and there is a robust fishing and shellfish industry in the area. The survey assessed public perceptions of the benefits of the coastal spine. Specifically, respondents were asked if building the coastal spine would make them feel that their home is at less risk to disaster impacts and that their job is more secure. Figure 10 displays the responses by county. The majority of Galveston (56.10%) and Chambers (52.78%) County respondents believed their home is at less risk; 46.63% of Harris County respondents said the same. Fewer respondents felt that their job is more secure as result of the coastal spine. Nearly 45% of Chambers County respondents said they feel their job is more secure, compared to 39.10% and 32.94% of Galveston and Harris County respondents, respectively. In addition, the survey evaluated perceptions of failure of the coastal spine. Specifically the survey asked: \"How concerned are you that a physical structure like the coastal spine has the potential to fail, meaning it might not work in a disaster or may break down?\" Concern was highest among Chambers County respondents -65.65% said they were \"concerned a lot\" or \"somewhat concerned.\" Only 58.55% and 59.33% of Galveston and Harris County respondents, respectively, expressed the same. Concern for the negative environmental consequences of the coastal spine were also assessed. Several environmental groups in the area have raised concerns that the construction of the coastal spine and operation of its gate structures will have unintended environmental consequences. 11 These include changes in water flow, salinity, sediment transport, and restricted movement for larval and adult wildlife species. In line with the issues raised by environmental groups, the survey asked respondents: \"How concerned are you that the construction of the coastal spine may damage the surrounding marine and coastal environment?\" Overall, 50.59% of respondents said they were \"concerned a lot\" or \"somewhat concerned\" about the impacts of the coastal spine on the marine and coastal environment. The highest levels of concern were observed among Chambers and Galveston County respondents -65.64% and 58.07%, respectively, compared to 49.91% of Harris County respondents. Galveston County residents have expressed concern about the coastal barrier system that extends beyond environmental threats. The research team attended two public forums to assess the scope of citizen concerns in the county focused on the Ike Dike. Four major issues emerged in these community forums: 1) uncertainty regarding financing to support long-term maintenance of the structure; 2) the footprint of the extended seawall would cover many businesses and large parts of the channel; 3) uncertainty regarding communities on the outer edge of the storm barrier; and 4) construction of the coastal spine on Bolivar Peninsula will create accessibility issues for some neighborhoods. The survey results indicate that respondents in the tri-county area are both cognizant of the benefits of the coastal barrier system as well as unintended consequences on the natural system. The public forums showed that residents are also concerned about the implementation of the infrastructure project and how it may disrupt social and economic activities, particularly on Galveston Island and Bolivar Peninsula."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This chapter summarizes the findings of the first survey to systematically evaluate public perceptions in Chambers, Galveston, and Harris Counties of the coastal spine. The survey reveals that there is widespread lack of awareness of the coastal spine -approximately 72% of respondents have not heard of the Ike Dike before the survey. Yet, when survey respondents were read the description of the coastal spine, their responses were overwhelmingly positive. The results point to widespread support not only for general coastal mitigation strategies but specifically for a coastal barrier system. Approximately 73% of the respondents supported, to some degree, the construction of the coastal spine. Despite widespread support for coastal protection, the survey reveals that there are challenges in the implementation of the coastal barrier system. First, such a regional project must balance varying community interests and concerns. The survey results indicate the highest levels of support for the Ike Dike was found among Galveston and Harris County respondents while Chambers County respondents were more divided in opposition and support. About 17% of Chambers County respondents expressed opposition to the coastal spine, compared to approximately 14% and 9% of Galveston and Harris County respondents, respectively. This underscores the variance of community interests and concerns as well as individual experiences, values, and perceptions. Preliminary analysis presented in this chapter demonstrated flood risk perceptions are connected to support for the coastal spine with higher risk linked to greater support. Future research should further unpack the drivers of support, likely based on proximity to the coast as well as other socioeconomic factors. Second, financing the coastal barrier system will require public and private buy-in. The majority of respondents -56% -believed that both government and port industries should be responsible for financing the coastal barrier system. Approximately two-thirds of respondents supported some type of tax (i.e., sales, hotel, property, new) to support the coastal spine. Although, support for tax type varied across county with Galveston County expressing the highest preference, among the three counties, for hotel tax while Harris and Chambers Counties were more supportive of sales taxes. Third, the environmental consequences of the coastal spine remain a concern among coastal community residents. While over 50% of Chambers and Galveston County respondents said they feel their home would be at less risk as a result of the coastal spine, over 50% of respondents also expressed concern about the unintended consequences of the Ike Dike on the environment. Addressing these concerns, alongside the widespread lack of awareness among the public about the coastal spine, could increase community engagement in meaningful ways that not only reduce the risk faced by coastal communities in Texas but also increase their collective community resilience.  The middle section in Figure 1 is quite similar to the coastal spine that was recommended by the Gulf Coast Community Protection and Recovery District (GCCPRD, 2016). The combination of middle and eastern sections is quite similar to the coastal spine alignment that is included in Alternative A for the Houston-Galveston region, as proposed in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Galveston District's Coastal Texas Study. Alternative A appears to be the likely USACE Tentatively Selected Plan (TSP). Note, that both the GCCPRD and USACE coastal spine alignments omit the western section shown in Figure 1. Omission of the western section of a coastal spine is the basis for the concerns expressed here. The Ike Dike coastal spine concept achieves its effectiveness by suppressing entry of the open-coast storm surge into West and Galveston Bays. Once storm surge enters the very shallow bays, hurricane-force winds are extremely effective in pushing water from one side of the bay to the other, leading to even higher surge levels on the down-wind side. The specific areas around the bay's periphery which are impacted by the enhanced surge can change rapidly as a hurricane transits the region. The middle section of the coastal spine concept (see Figure 1) significantly reduces storm surge entry into the bays; the eastern section to a far lesser degree. Omission of a western section is akin to leaving a \"back door\" open; it significantly compromises the performance and effectiveness of the Ike Dike concept by allowing a substantial amount of water to flow into the bays prior to hurricane landfall. Omission of the western section increases flood risk to most, if not all, areas of the Houston-Galveston region that are fronted by the coastal spine. It does so through the following two mechanisms: 1) allowing the hurricane surge forerunner to propagate through San Luis Pass into the bays, in the days leading up to hurricane landfall, and 2) allowing the peak storm surge to flank the western end of the coastal barrier, initially via San Luis Pass and then via an inundated Follet's Island, as the hurricane approaches and makes landfall. Adverse impacts due to forerunner propagation and storm surge flanking can be substantial for communities and industries in Brazoria and Galveston Counties that ring West Bay, including all of Galveston Island. Impacts can extend into Galveston Bay. Rising sea level will exacerbate adverse impacts associated with leaving the \"back door\" open, throughout the Houston-Galveston region. Analyses, and results derived from them, which led to conclusions regarding the adverse impacts associated with omission of a western section, are described in more detail below. Leaving a \"back door\" open to West and Galveston Bays compromises performance of the coastal spine proposed by the USACE as part of the Coastal Texas Study's Alternative A for the Houston-Galveston region. We recommend that the USACE closely examine the adverse flooding that arises due to omission of a western dike section and re-evaluate the decision to not include a western dike/gate section in the likely TSP."}, {"section_title": "Investigative Approach", "text": "To examine the impacts of omitting the western section, storm surge simulations were made for two different alignments of a coastal spine. Each alignment had a different combination of the dike sections shown in Figure 1. The TAMUG Ike Dike concept was comprised of all three dike sections (middle+eastern+western sections). An alignment similar to that included as part of USACE Alternative A was comprised of two of the sections (middle+eastern sections), but with no western section. The crest elevation of all dike sections considered in the surge simulations, for both alignments, was 17 ft, NAVD88. A set of eight hurricanes were simulated for each alignment using the USACE Coastal Modeling System (which includes the ADCIRC storm surge model). Simulations were made by staff at the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center's Coastal & Hydraulics Laboratory, with analysis done by research staff at Jackson State University. Simulated hurricanes were selected from among historic and hypothetical, idealized storms that were considered in the FEMA RiskMap study which was most recently performed for the Texas coast. A summary of the characteristics for all eight simulated hurricanes is provided in Table  1. Table 1. Characteristics of Simulated Hurricanes. Hurricanes were selected using the following rationale. Hypothetical hurricanes were selected to best replicate peak surge levels associated with different average recurrence intervals at one of two desired locations, as indicated in Table 1, for the without-project condition. One set of hypothetical storms was selected to replicate 10-yr, 100-yr and 500-yr water levels along the western shoreline of Galveston Bay and into the upper reaches of the Houston Ship Channel. These are the areas with the highest potential for economic damage and losses. A second set was identified that replicates the 10-yr, 100-yr and 500-yr water levels at the entrance to San Luis Pass. Storm surge elevation at the entrance to San Luis Pass strongly influences the amount of water that enters through the open \"back door\" created by omission of the western dike section. The most intense hurricanes (having 900 mb minimum central pressure) are those that closely replicate the 500-yr water levels; the less intense hurricanes (having a 960 or 975 mb minimum central pressure) are those which closely replicate the 10-yr water levels. Hurricane Ike was selected because of the high surge forerunner and peak surge it created in the Houston-Galveston Region, and its relatively recent occurrence. Simulated hurricanes followed one of the four tracks shown in Figure 2. Severe, land falling hurricanes that have impacted the Texas coast, historically, have generally approached from the southeast, like Hurricane Tracks 1 and 3 and the track for Hurricane Ike. Occasionally they have approached from the south, like Track 2. Hurricane Harvey approached from the south. Simulations were made for each storm identified in Table 1, for each of the two coastal spine alignments (with and without a western section), and for both a present mean sea level (0.9 ft NAVD88) and a future sea level scenario that is 2.4 ft above present sea level (3.3 ft NAVD88). This future sea level is the level projected for the year 2085 using the USACE methodology and assuming an intermediate rate of sea level rise. The modeling approach that was employed reflects the current state of engineering practice, which does not include the effects of hurricane rainfall in the storm surge simulations."}, {"section_title": "Hurricane Surge Forerunner Propagation through San Luis Pass", "text": "Major hurricanes that traverse the Gulf of Mexico, and eventually approach the north Texas coast, can generate a significant hurricane surge forerunner. The combination of the curved shape of the Louisiana/Texas continental shelf in the northwest corner of the Gulf and the circular wind field about the eye of an approaching hurricane is conducive to formation of a wind-driven forerunner. The forerunner is forced by far-field winds that circulate in a counterclockwise direction about the hurricane eye while it is still far offshore in the deep Gulf. Such far field winds blow from east to west to southwest over the Louisiana and north Texas continental shelves. These winds tend to force an east-to-west movement of water along the shelf which is turned to the \"right\" in the northern hemisphere by the Coriolis force, and stacked against the Louisiana and north Texas coastlines. The Coriolis force is associated with the earth's rotation. This stacking of water across the shelf and against the shoreline is called Ekman set-up, and this is the physical process behind formation of the wind-driven hurricane surge forerunner. The surge forerunner begins as a forced wave that advances along the northern Gulf shelf from east to west with the advancing storm; but then, after landfall on the north Texas coast, the forerunner propagates as a free wave southward along the south Texas continental shelf. This along-shelf propagation of the surge forerunner was first shown for Hurricane Ike by other researchers. Hurricane Ike produced a sizable forerunner. The surge forerunner is experienced at the coast as a slow steady rise in the water surface elevation which begins while the hurricane eye is well offshore, days before landfall. The rate of water level rise begins to accelerate as the eye moves across the continental shelf. During Ike, the water level increase began several days before landfall and reached a measured amplitude in excess of 6 ft above the seasonal mean sea level at the Galveston Pleasure Pier, twelve hours before landfall. Water level data acquired by NOAA also show that the forerunner propagated into Galveston Bay through the tidal passes and into the upper reaches of the Houston Ship Channel with little attenuation. As observed during Ike, the forerunner can propagate into the bays via the tidal passes. Once, closed, a storm surge gate system at the much deeper and more hydraulically efficient Bolivar Roads pass will eliminate subsequent forerunner propagation into the Bays through this particular pass. However, leaving the \"back door\" open at San Luis Pass, albeit a shallower, less hydraulically efficient pass, will still allow some propagation of the forerunner into West and Galveston Bays. This issue was examined using the simulation of Hurricane Ike, for both present and future sea levels. Figure 3 shows the simulated surge forerunner elevation for Hurricane Ike, at a snap shot in time, twelve hours before landfall, when the eye (yellow dot) is still situated well offshore. At the open coast near San Luis Pass, the amplitude of the forerunner surge reached an elevation of 5.3 ft above the seasonal mean sea level approximately twelve hours prior to landfall. Figure 4 shows the change in simulated water surface elevation with time for Hurricane Ike at two locations: the first inside West Bay (upper panel), midway between San Luis Pass and the City of Galveston; and the second roughly in the center of Galveston Bay (bottom panel).  The thin orange dashed curves in both the upper and lower panels of Figure 4 show the water surface elevation time series for the TAMUG Ike Dike concept, which has a western closure section. The thin blue solid curves show the water surface elevation for the coastal spine alignment like the USACE Alternative A that has no western section. The thick black curve shows the difference between the orange and blue curves; it quantifies the change in water surface elevation due to leaving the \"back door\" open, i.e., the impact of having no western section. Prior to hour 1044 of the simulation, the black \"difference\" curves reflect the influence of forerunner propagation through San Luis Pass. Without the western section, in West Bay, the forerunner surge elevation steadily rises to maximum amplitude of 2.9 ft, 12 hours before landfall. Results indicate some attenuation through the shallow San Luis Pass, from an amplitude of 5.3 ft on the open coast to an amplitude of 2.9 ft inside West Bay. In Galveston Bay, the forerunner also grows steadily in the days prior to landfall and its amplitude reaches 0.7 ft, evidence of forerunner propagation from West Bay into Galveston Bay; although additional attenuation occurs as the forerunner propagates from West Bay into Galveston Bay. Results for the Upper Houston Ship Channel, not shown here, are nearly identical to those shown for the center of Galveston Bay. Once inside Galveston Bay, there is little attenuation of the forerunner amplitude, as was observed during the actual Hurricane Ike. For the simulated Hurricane Ike, as a consequence of forerunner propagation through an open San Luis Pass, the entire West Bay water level is raised by 2.9 ft, and the entire Galveston Bay water level is raised by 0.7 ft, everywhere, 12 hours before landfall. As also seen in Figure 4, around hour 1060 of the simulation, the effect of omitting a western section on peak surge is an increase of approximately 5.2 ft at the central West Bay location and an increase of 1.5 ft at the central Galveston Bay location. The adverse effects of an open \"back door\" on peak surge and inundation inside the bays are discussed at greater length in the next section. The Hurricane Ike simulation for future sea level shows that omission of the western section leads to similar results for surge forerunner propagation into West Bay as obtained for the present sea level; a slightly higher hurricane forerunner surge of 3.1 ft twelve hours prior to landfall, and an increase in peak surge of about 5.2 ft. However, in Galveston Bay, the forerunner surge amplitude is 1.2 ft (0.5 ft higher than for present sea level case) and the increase in peak surge is 2 ft (also an increase of 0.5 ft). With the \"back door\" open, rising sea level apparently reduces the attenuation of, and increases the propagation efficiency of, the surge forerunner from West Bay into Galveston Bay. This leads to higher forerunner surge and peak surge values in Galveston Bay. The effects of higher future sea level on peak surge and inundation inside the bays are discussed at greater length in a subsequent section."}, {"section_title": "Influence of Flanking of the USACE TSP Coastal Spine by the Storm Surge", "text": "Without a western section of the coastal spine, as the hurricane eye approaches landfall and as the forerunner development period transitions into development of the peak surge, the storm surge continues to propagate into West Bay via San Luis Pass and then over Follet's Island as well once the island becomes inundated. Even for relatively frequent hurricane events, omission of the western section leads to inundation within communities on western and central Galveston Island, inundation that would be avoided with a western dike section in place. The adverse effects of flanking are much more widespread for more severe hurricanes. The effect of surge flanking is illustrated below using both peak surge maps and inundation maps. Colored shaded contour maps of peak surge depict the peak storm surge elevation calculated at every location in the storm surge model's (ADCIRC's) computational domain, without regard to when the peak surge elevation occurred during the simulation. These peak surge maps do not represent snap shots in time. To illustrate the spatial extent of inundation, both with and without a western section, a \"transparent\" peak surge map is superimposed over a background satellite image to create an inundation map. Pairs of maps are presented in figures below. The map in the top panel of each figure shows the peak surge map, or inundation map, for the Ike Dike coastal spine concept which has a western section; and, the map in the bottom panel shows results for the alignment that is similar to the USACE Alternative 1 alignment, which omits the western section. Peak surge and inundation maps are shown for three of the storms listed in Table 1: Hurricane Ike, Storm 023, and Storm 019. The simulation of Hurricane Ike produced a peak surge of approximately 10 ft NAVD88 at San Luis Pass and about 14 ft NAVD88 at the City of Galveston. Storm 023 is a hypothetical hurricane that produced the 100-yr water level at San Luis Pass of 14 ft NAVD88; and Storm 019 is a hypothetical hurricane that replicated the 10-yr water level at San Luis Pass of 7 ft NAVD88, a much more frequent event. Figure 5 shows peak storm surge maps for Hurricane Ike, for present sea level, with (top panel) and without (bottom panel) a western section. Results clearly show that the peak surge is much higher in West Bay with the \"back door\" open. The increases in peak surge are greatest near San Luis Pass and they decrease from west to east within West Bay. Without the western section, peak surge at the west end of Galveston Island is 5 to 5.5 ft higher than the peak surge with the western section. The effect of leaving the \"back door\" open on peak surge extends to the City of Galveston, where the peak surge is 1.5 to 2 ft higher without the western section. The increase in peak surge with the \"back door\" open is not limited to West Bay. Increases also are evident in Galveston Bay; however, the magnitude of the increase in peak surge is less in Galveston Bay than it is in West Bay. Peak surge differences in Galveston Bay, approximately 1 to 1.5 ft in most places, are slightly smaller than differences at the City of Galveston. For Hurricane Ike, present sea level, some of lowest-lying areas on western Galveston Island closest to West Bay are inundated even with the western section in place (top panel in Figure 6). However, without the western section, inundation of terrain surrounding West Bay is much more widespread; and, western Galveston Island is nearly completely inundated (circled region in the bottom panel of Figure 6).    Figure 8 shows peak surge maps for Storm 023, present sea level, with a western section (top panel) and without a western section (bottom panel). Results show that the peak surge is, again, much higher in West Bay with the \"back door\" open. Again, as is seen for this and all the storms that were simulated, the increases in peak surge are greatest nearer San Luis Pass and they decrease from west to east in West Bay. Without the western section, peak surge at the west end of Galveston Island is 7 ft higher than the peak surge with the western section in place. At the City of Galveston, the peak surge is 1 ft higher without the western section. Increases in peak surge also are evident in Galveston Bay; however, the magnitude of the increase in peak surge is less in Galveston Bay than it is in West Bay. Peak surge differences in Galveston Bay are comparable to the differences at the City of Galveston, approximately 1 ft in many places, less along the western side of the Bay. For Storm 023, present sea level, some of lowest-lying areas on western Galveston Island closest to West Bay are inundated with the western section in place (upper panel of Figure 9). However, without the western section, inundation of terrain surrounding West Bay is much more widespread and western Galveston Island is completely inundated (see the circled area in the bottom panel of Figure 9). Inundation is more severe for Storm 023 than for Hurricane Ike. Without the western section, a LNG complex near Freeport is significantly inundated as are the petro-chemical complexes along Chocolate Bayou; both facilities are circled in the bottom panel of Figure 9. "}, {"section_title": "132", "text": "For Storm 023, present sea level, some of lowest-lying areas on eastern Galveston Island are inundated with the western section in place (see top panel in Figure 10). However, without the western section, inundation of the indicated eastern Galveston Island communities is complete, multiple communities on the north side of West Bay are inundated, as are parts of the City of Galveston, including the airport (see the circled areas in the bottom panel of Figure 10). Leaving the \"back door\" open leads to increased flooding and inundation on Galveston Island even for relatively frequent, weaker hurricane events, like Storm 019. Storm 019 was selected to replicate the 10yr average recurrence interval water level at the entrance to San Luis Pass, a water level of 7 ft NAVD88. Figures 11 and 12, show the increase in inundation that occurs for Storm 019, present sea level, with the \"back door\" open (top panels) and the \"back door\" closed (bottom panels). Figures 11 and 12 show the differences in inundation for western and central Galveston Island, respectively.  "}, {"section_title": "Influence of Sea Level Rise on Increased Peak Surge and Inundation Associated with Flanking", "text": "In general, rising sea level will increase flood risk throughout the Houston-Galveston region, both with and without a western section. Low-lying areas and areas with low topography gradients are most susceptible to increases in sea level. However, leaving the \"back door\" open increases the susceptibility of the most vulnerable areas to flooding as sea level rises. Aside from those areas around West Bay where flooding and inundation is exacerbated by sea level rise, there also are areas around the periphery of Galveston Bay which experience exacerbated inundation for the future sea level scenario as a consequence of leaving the \"back door\" open. For example, for Hurricane Ike and the future sea level scenario, a number of areas in the City of Galveston are exposed to inundation, which otherwise, would not be inundated with the western section in place (see the circled area in Figure 13). There also are similarly affected areas along the western shoreline of Galveston Bay. For Hurricane Ike, and the future sea level scenario, parts of the town of San Leon, adjacent to Dickinson Bay, are inundated (circled area in the bottom panel of Figure 14) which would not occur with the western section in place (top panel of Figure 14). A similar influence is seen along the east shore of Galveston Bay. For Hurricane Ike, and the future sea level scenario, the town of Oak Island is inundated (circled area in the bottom panel of Figure 15), which would not occur with the western section in place (top panel of Figure 15). With rising sea level, the adverse effects of leaving the \"back door\" open are clearly not restricted to West Bay. "}, {"section_title": "Relative Merits of the Eastern and Western Dike Section in Suppressing Propagation of Storm Surge into the Bays", "text": "To examine the relative merits of both the western and eastern dike sections in suppressing storm surge propagation into the bays, all the storms in Table 1 were simulated for a third coastal spine alignment that is shown in Figure 16. This alignment is quite similar to the alignment recommended by the GCCPRD in their final report. This alignment has neither the western nor eastern dike sections; it has only the middle section, which extends from the west end of Galveston Island to High Island. To quantify the additional storm surge that enters the Houston-Galveston region by not having an eastern section, the peak surge field for the alignment that is similar to the coastal spine included in the likely USACE TSP (comprised of middle+eastern sections), which was discussed previously and is shown in Figure  17, is subtracted from the peak surge field for the alignment shown in Figure 16 (middle section only). Results are shown in a series of figures below, Figures 18, 19 and 20. There is one figure for each of three storms, Hurricane Ike (Figure 18) and the two hypothetical storms which best replicated the 100-yr and 500-yr water levels within Galveston Bay, Storms 033 ( Figure 19) and 036 ( Figure 20) in Table 1, respectively. Of all the storms simulated, these three produced the highest peak surges in the vicinity of the eastern dike section. Therefore, of all the storms simulated, these three would be those in which having an eastern section would be most beneficial. All results shown are from simulations made using the future sea level scenario. For each storm, the upper panel in each figure shows the increase in peak surge that occurs without a western section of the coastal spine concept; and the bottom panel shows the increase in peak surge that occurs without an eastern section. Results for all three storms show that the western dike section provides much greater flood risk reduction benefits throughout both West and Galveston Bays than does the eastern dike section. The eastern section primarily provides peak surge reduction benefits in the vicinity of the eastern dike section; whereas, the western section provides peak surge reduction benefits throughout the Houston-Galveston region that lies behind the coastal spine, even communities located along the eastern shoreline of Galveston Bay. Results are quite similar to those for the simulations made for present sea level.   These observations are primarily due to the fact that high storm surge conditions develop at the location of the eastern dike section much later during the storm, just before landfall. Flanking flow around the eastern end of the coastal spine at High Island, in the absence of an eastern section, commences at this time, relatively late in the storm. And, when flanking of the eastern side occurs, the eastern side of the bay is severely set down by hurricane force winds that blow from east to west within Galveston Bay. Water that flows around the eastern end of the barrier and into the eastern portion of the Bay, flows into an area where water levels are already significantly depressed, creating minimal influence on peak surge levels at locations in the bays away from the eastern section. Whereas, in the absence of a western section, storm surge steadily propagates through the open \"back door\" beginning with the surge forerunner several days before landfall. Flow into the bays continues while the storm transits the continental shelf, and approaches and makes landfall, as storm surge builds at the entrance to San Luis Pass. Flanking flow around the western end of the barrier in the likely USACE TSP occurs for a much longer duration and it influences peak surge levels throughout both bays."}]
