[{"section_title": "", "text": "\u2022 The shifts were persistent, with a general pattern of increase between each Census of Agriculture conducted between 1982 and 2007. However, less comprehensive evidence from annual surveys suggests that the pace of consolidation slowed between 2007 and 2011, the last year for which data are available. Data from the 2012 Census will provide more defi nitive evidence of recent trends. \u2022 Larger crop farms continue to realize better fi nancial performance: average rates of return on equity increased with farm size in fi ve major commodity categories analyzed in this report (corn, soybeans, wheat, fruits, and vegetables). In turn, larger farms utilize labor and capital more intensively, which provide them with the primary source of their fi nancial advantage. The long-term shifts in farm size have been accompanied by greater specialization-beginning with a separation of livestock farming from crop farming in the latter half of the 20th century. As crop and livestock production separated, full-time crop farmers could devote more time to crop production and manage more cropland. At the same time, the number of production and marketing contracts to govern the sale of products has increased. Contracts covered 32 percent of crop production in 2011, compared with 23 percent in the mid-1990s. Larger operations are more likely to use contracts, which can reduce the price and marketing risks faced by farmers. Technology also plays an important role in driving increases in farm size, by allowing a single farmer to operate and manage more acres. Labor-saving innovations-from bigger and faster capital equipment to information technology, chemical herbicides, seed genetics, and changing tillage techniques-have substantially reduced the total amount of labor used in agriculture and facilitated the shift to larger crop farms. Federal policies may affect farm structure through multiple channels, such as taxes, lending programs, environmental or food safety regulation, research and development funding, and commodity programs. Some effects are straightforward and fairly direct, while others are subtle and indirect. The impact of broad commodity policy is particularly complex. Some have argued that commodity and crop insurance programs, by reducing the fi nancial risks faced by farmers, encouraged the adoption of organizational forms and capital equipment that spurred increases in farm size. It is, however, diffi cult to separate the impact of policy from technology itself and from other factors that affected farm risks. While the above conditions may have facilitated the shifts toward larger farms, family farms continue to dominate crop agriculture. In 2011, 96 percent of U.S. crop farms were family farms, and they accounted for 87 percent of the value of crop production."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Large farms now dominate crop production in the United States. While most cropland was on farms with less than 600 acres in the early 1980s, today most cropland is on farms with at least 1,100 acres, and many crop farms are 5 and 10 times that size. This ongoing shift in control of farm resources and production raises a host of questions addressed in this report. How extensive is this structural change? Why is cropland moving to larger farms? Is the shift associated with other changes in farm structure, and will it continue? Do these structural shifts portend an end to family farms, and the emergence of corporate farms with diffused ownership and hired professional managers? Economic Research Service (ERS) researchers measure and describe the nature of the changes that have occurred and assess the driving forces behind those changes, with an emphasis on technology, land attributes, farm organization, and public policy. 1 The shift of acreage and production to larger farms is ongoing and ubiquitous, occurring in most States and for most crops, including major fi eld crops as well as fruits and vegetables. Because large farms continue to realize better fi nancial returns, on average, than small and mid-size farms, it is reasonable to expect continued shifts of production and land to larger farms. The complexity of U.S. farm structure makes the shift of acreage to larger farms hard to discern with common metrics. In recent years, the number of mid-size crop farms has declined sharply, while farm numbers at the extremes (large and small) have grown. As a result the size of the average farm (in acres) has changed little, but large farms have gotten considerably larger as they farm more of the country's cropland. The report documents the complex nature of modern farm structure and introduces statistics aimed at better tracking shifts of land and production."}, {"section_title": "Measuring Farm Size", "text": "In this report, farm size is defi ned according to acres of cropland operated by the farm, which is a transparent, easily understood measure for which statistics have been kept for many years. It is particularly well suited to the primary purpose of the report, assessing the consolidation of cropland into larger operations over time. Farms may own cropland, but they also grow crops on cropland that they rent. The report defi nes farm size according to the cropland operated by the farm-that is, the cropland it owns, plus any that it rents, minus any rented to others. 1 An earlier ERS report (MacDonald and McBride, 2009) analyzed consolidation in livestock agriculture. Hoppe et al. (2010) document shifts of production to larger farms, using infl ation-adjusted sales, while O'Donoghue et al. (2011) document broad changes in U.S. farm structure. James M. MacDonald, Penni Korb, and Robert A. Hoppe Farm Size and the Organization of U.S. Crop Farming ARMS data. The research also relies heavily on the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS), an annual survey of U.S. farms that is jointly administered by NASS and ERS. The ARMS is based on a representative sample of farms and their operators in the 48 contiguous States. The survey has been conducted annually since 1996, and the most recent data available for this report covered farm performance in 2011. With a total national sample of just over 20,000 farms, ARMS cannot provide the comprehensive measures at the State and commodity level that the census provides, and it cannot match the long temporal span of the census. However, the survey gives more detailed data on farm fi nances, operators, resources, and practices than are available elsewhere. As an annual survey, it also gives greater and more recent temporal detail than the census. -continued During most of the years covered in this report, Phase III includes fi ve questionnaire versions. Version 5, shorter than the others, contains a core set of questions. Version 1 adds a detailed set of research questions on production and management practices and resource use to the core. Versions 2, 3, and 4-known as commodity versions-add commodity-specifi c questions to the core and are aimed at representative samples of commercial producers of the Phase II crops and one livestock commodity. Most ARMS-based statistics in this report are drawn from the core questions that appear on all versions of the survey, while some are based on questions that appear only in Version 1. 1 As necessary, observations from several years are combined to generate larger samples (ARMS is not a panel, so different farms appear in different years). In the text discussion and table notes, distinctions are drawn between: \u2022 Data drawn from Phase II and from Phase III; \u2022 Data drawn from all Phase III versions and from version 1 only; \u2022 Farms from a single year and farms pooled across 2008-2011. Finally, NASS uses a stratifi ed sampling strategy to improve the reliability of estimates in ARMS. That means that some farms have a higher probability of sample selection-larger operations are more likely to be selected than smaller ones, and selection probabilities also vary across geographic areas and commodity types. Population estimates are generated by weighting sample observations to refl ect their varying selection probabilities.

However, this seeming stability masks important structural changes in the complex U.S. farm sector. There are growing numbers of very small and very large farms and declining numbers of mid-sized farms. Cropland acreage has moved toward much larger farms. Start with the complex size pattern of U.S. farms. In fi gure 1, based on 2011 ARMS data, farms and cropland acreage are sorted into eight cropland size classes frequently reported in Census of Agriculture publications. In that year, 391.6 million acres of cropland were divided among 1.675 million U.S. farms with cropland, for an average (mean) farm size of 234 acres. However, relatively few farms are near the average. Eighty percent of farms with cropland were smaller than the mean size, and 70 percent were less than half the mean size. The median farm size (at which half of farms were larger and half were smaller) was just 45 acres. Similarly, little cropland is on farms near the average. Eighty-three percent of cropland was on farms that were larger than the mean size, and 71 percent was on farms that were more than twice The size distribution of crop farms, 2011 Note: Farm size is defined according to the cropland the farm operates-that is, the cropland it owns, plus any that it rents, minus any rented to others.

Figure 2 reports the same data for 2001; together the two fi gures summarize a decade of structural change. The mean farm size was little different (235 acres), but the median farm size in 2001 (63 acres) was substantially larger than that in 2011. There were nearly 100,000 more farms with 1-49 acres of cropland in 2011 than in 2001, as the count of small farms in USDA statistics increased sharply. (See box: \"The Increasing Number of Small Crop Farms.\") Cropland moved in the other direction: the largest farms (at least 2,000 acres of cropland) accounted for 34.3 percent of cropland in 2011, up from 24.1 percent in 2001, and the number of farms with at least 2,000 acres of cropland increased during the decade. The midpoint acreage refl ects the shift in cropland: it was 900 acres in 2001 (fi g. 2), compared to 1,100 in 2011 (fi g. 1). Because of the complexity of changes in crop farm structure, simple measures of mean farm size are not very informative. Simple means and medians focus on the average farm, and the land operated by the average farmer. This report is focused on the use of cropland and must focus on the average acre of cropland, not the average farmer or average farm.

If the 1950-1974 trend had continued, there would have been less than 150,000 farms in that size class by 2011. However, the trend did not continue; the number of small farms, whether measured by sales or by acreage, declined much less rapidly after 1974 and began to increase after 2000. In part, the survival and expansion of small crop farms may refl ect farming opportunities as well as popular lifestyle choices by people who prefer to combine a rural lifestyle with modest crop or livestock production. A farmer can operate a small fi eld crop operation on a part-time basis while also maintaining an off-farm job, or while drawing additional income from pensions and savings. 1 However, how farms are counted also matters when considering trends in farm numbers. USDA, under the direction of Congress, has since 1974 defi ned a farm as a place that produces, or normally could produce, at least $1,000 worth of agricultural commodities in a year. 2 Because the defi nition is not adjusted for infl ation, it will defi ne more very small places as farms as farm commodity prices rise, and the Producer Price Index for Farm Products (Bureau of Labor Statistics) rose by 172 percent between 1974, when the defi nition was set, and 2011. USDA/NASS has also made concerted efforts in recent years to better identify and track very small farms. 3 While these efforts improve survey methodology and provide more comprehensive coverage, their implementation indicates that some part of the observed increase in small farm numbers refl ects better counting, not more farms. Because most of these farms are so small, with very limited production, their inclusion adds very little cropland or production to census aggregates. Farm Size and the Organization of U.S. Crop Farming, ERR-152 Economic Research Service/USDA ARMS data were used in fi gures 1 and 2 to summarize modern-day farm structure. ERS analysts used Census of Agriculture data to compare longer run trends in midpoint acreages and simple means during 1982-2007 (fi g. 3). 3 The differences are striking. While mean farm size changed little between 1982 and 2007-from 221 acres to 241, or a 9-percent increase-the midpoint for cropland grew by 88 percent, from 589 acres to 1,105. The simple mean peaked in 1997, and declined thereafter, but the midpoint acreage rose steadily from 1982 through 2007. The differences refl ect the shift of cropland to larger farms, even as increases in the number of very small farms kept the mean farm size from increasing substantially. While the average farm did not get much larger, acreage moved to much larger farms. 4 The trend in the midpoint for harvested cropland does not exactly match that for cropland-the cropland measure rises steadily from 1982 to 2007, while the harvested cropland measure only rises after 1987-but the basic message is similar (fi g. 3). The midpoint acreage for harvested cropland rose by 114 percent, from 500 acres in 1982 to 1,071 acres in 2007. Shifts of cropland to larger farms mirror similar shifts of agricultural production from smaller to larger sales classes during 1982-2007. Hoppe et al. (2010 use Census of Agriculture data to show that farms with at least $1 million in sales (measured in 2007 dollars, and thus adjusted for changes in prices) accounted for 24 percent of the value of agricultural production in 1982 and 59 percent in 2007. Meanwhile the share held by small commercial farms, with $10,000 to $250,000 in sales, fell by two-thirds."}, {"section_title": "Cropland Consolidation in the States", "text": "The pace of cropland consolidation varied widely across States, although most saw substantial increases. Figure 4 reports State-by-State changes in the midpoint acreages for harvested cropland between 1982 and 2007. Harvested cropland shifted to smaller farms in 5 States, but shifted to larger"}, {"section_title": "Midpoint Measures in Industry Analyses", "text": "Midpoints have been widely used in industry analyses, often based on employment, where half of industry employees are at larger plants or fi rms, and half are at smaller (Florence, 1933;Scherer and Ross, 1990;Davis and Haltiwanger, 1991). As distinct from simple medians, they have been called Florence medians, referring to the fi rst economics author to use them in 1933, and weighted medians, since they can be calculated by weighting each observation by its size (acreage, or employment in the most common applications). The measure is especially useful for size distributions that are highly skewed, with many very small operations while employment, acreage, or production is concentrated in a small number of large fi rms. Most U.S industries, including agriculture, are characterized by highly skewed size distributions. Acreage-based midpoints have been applied to the measurement of farm size by Lund and Price (1998), Key and Roberts (2007a), and O'Donoghue et al (2011). Lund and Price (1998)  farms in the other 45, and midpoint acreages rose by more than 100 percent in 16 States. Declines occurred in Hawaii, where plantation agriculture that focused on pineapple and banana production was shifting to more diversifi ed crop agriculture. Declines also occurred in Alabama and Southern New England. Increases of at least 100 percent occurred across a contiguous set of 12 Corn Belt and Northern Great Plains States, as well as Idaho, Maryland, Mississippi, and North Carolina. A simple statistical analysis helps to summarize the patterns. Specifi cally, four attributes of a State's agricultural environment account for a substantial share of the variation in growth rates across States. (See box: \"Accounting for Cross-State Differences in Consolidation.\") Midpoint acreages increased more in areas where most land was cropland, with little land in forest, pasture, commercial, or residential uses. In such States, crop fi elds are more likely to be large and contiguous to one another, rather than scattered among other land uses. Consolidation also increased faster where population was less dense; denser populations make cropland consolidation more costly because of greater competition for land. Finally, midpoint acreages increased more in those States with high shares of harvested cropland relative to cropland, and where hay accounted for a smaller share of harvested cropland. Hay was more likely to be produced in regions with noncontiguous cropland and smaller fi elds, and it was also concentrated on hillier land that is often less suited to other fi eld crops. Three measures of average farm size Note: \"Midpoint acreage\" defined-half of all cropland acres are on farms with more cropland than the midpoint, and half are on farms with less. \"Mean\" defined-total number of cropland acres is divided by the total number of farms with cropland. Sources: Mean cropland is from the Census of Agriculture, while the midpoint acreages are ERS calculations from unpublished census of agriculture data The patterns of cropland consolidation do not rule out a role for organization, technology, or policy factors, and do not explain why consolidation is occurring, but the data suggest that the pace of cropland consolidation may vary with the presence of land and population attributes that constrain farm size."}, {"section_title": "Consolidation Among Specifi c Commodities", "text": "A closer look at consolidation among specifi c crops provides further insight into the trends observed in total cropland. Table 1 summarizes data on harvested acres for major commodities in 2007 and crop receipts for 2007, 1982, and 1950 and reveals three key details. First, four crops (corn, hay, soybeans, and wheat) accounted for over 83 percent of harvested crop acres in 2007. Developments in these few crops drive national trends in midpoint acreages for all cropland combined. Second, harvested acres do not correspond closely to cash receipts for crops. The three high-value categories-vegetables and melons; fruits, nuts, and berries; and greenhouse/nursery crops-accounted for nearly 37 percent of all cash receipts from crops in 2007 but less than 4 percent of harvested acreage. Producers of these commodities use labor and physical capital intensively to produce high sales per acre. Because acreage and receipts do not correspond   closely, changes in farm size for high-value crops must be tracked separately, since their developments will be masked in aggregated acreage measures. Third, long-term shifts have occurred in the mix of crops produced. Cotton, tobacco, and oats accounted for a third of all crop cash receipts in 1950. Those shares dropped sharply between 1950 and 1982, and by 2007, the three crops accounted for just 5 percent of cash receipts. The share held by wheat also declined, as the combined share of corn and soybeans rose by nearly 25 percentage points, and the shares held by the high-value commodity categories rose by 11 percentage points. 5 5 Acreage also shifted among fi eld crops. Cotton and oats together combined for about 80 million acres (about 40 million each) in the late 1920s, compared to 12 million in 2007. The reduction in cotton acreage refl ected slowing cotton demand, due to the introduction and spread of manmade fi bers, combined with diminishing yields from traditional production areas in the Southeast and sharply rising yields in newer production areas in the Plains and West (Larson and Meyer, 1996). The reduction in oats refl ected the 20th century shift from horses and mules, which were fed oats and hay, to tractors for farm work. ERS researchers measured midpoint acreages for specifi c commodities and found that the shift to larger farms occurred in all major fi eld crops and in most fruit and vegetable crops. These measures represent enterprises, the part of the farm producing a specifi c commodity. For example, a farm producing corn and soybeans has a corn enterprise and a soybean enterprise, and the midpoint acreage for corn refl ects harvested corn acreage only, not harvested acreage of all crops on farms producing corn.    In 1997In -2007 of 39 commodities showed increases, and 12 of those increased by more in 1997-2007 than in 1987-1997. 7 The farm size distribution has become noticeably more skewed in fruits and vegetables, and midpoints provide information that is not apparent in simple means. Tomatoes provide an extreme but telling example. The 2007 census counted 25,809 farms, with 442,225 harvested acres of tomatoes, compared to 14,366 farms and 414,624 acres in 1997. Almost all of the increase in farm numbers occurred among farms with less than an acre of tomatoes: with new procedures designed to capture more very small farms, the 2007 census counted 17,536 farms with less than an acre of tomatoes, compared to 7,407 in 1997. The mean farm size-total acreage divided by the number of farms-fell from 29 to 17 acres, even as the midpoint acreage rose from 589 to 820 acres (table 3).  "}, {"section_title": "Consolidation in Livestock Production", "text": "ERS researchers measured livestock consolidation with midpoint sizes based on herd inventory for dairy cows and annual sales or removals for other livestock. In 1987, the midpoint dairy herd size was 80 cows; by 2007, it was 570 cows. The change in hogs was even more striking, from 1,200 hogs removed in a year to 30,000. But consolidation was widespread: midpoint head sold for fed cattle doubled between 1987 and 2007, while those for broilers and cow-calf operations (cattle, less than 500 pounds) more than doubled. Technology, in the form of economies of scale, played an important role in shifts to larger livestock operations, particularly in hog, dairy, fed cattle, and poultry production (MacDonald and McBride, 2009). Hog, poultry, and fed cattle production also became much more tightly integrated with processors over time, and changes in processor location, size, and contracting practices may have played a further role in livestock consolidation. "}, {"section_title": "Continuing Advantages to Size in Crop Farming", "text": "Larger crop farms perform better fi nancially, on average, than smaller farms. The differences refl ect lower costs per unit of production and not higher revenue. In turn, larger farms appear to be able to realize more production per unit of labor and capital. These fi nancial advantages have persisted over time, which suggests that shifts of production to larger crop farms will likely continue in the future. Larger farms realize higher rates of return on equity (table 5). 8 For each crop, profi t measures generally increase from one acreage class to the next, and the differences are large in total. The estimates are drawn from 2008-2011 data, but the pattern holds for other years as well. These differences in profi t performance do not stem from differences in revenue-larger grain and oilseed farms realize the same value of production per acre as smaller farms. The smallest vegetable farms (less than 50 acres) realize a higher value of production per acre than larger farms, but otherwise no apparent relation exists between size and revenue per acre at fruit and vegetable farms. These advantages must, therefore, arise from differences in farm production costs. Labor hours per harvested acre decline sharply as harvested acreage increases for corn, wheat, and soybean farms (table 6). 9 Farms harvesting more than 2,000 acres use less than half as much labor per acre as farms harvesting fewer than 500 acres. Table 6 also reports the value of equipment and structures (assets) owned by the farm, per harvested acre. Assets per acre decline persistently as farm size increases; they are 35 to 50 percent lower for the largest farms than for those in the 250-499 acre class. Table 7 reports the same measures for fruit and vegetable operations. Higher labor and capital use per acre in fruits and vegetables than in the fi eld crops refl ects the capital-intensive nature of fruit and vegetable production. However, the same general size relationship holds: labor hours per harvested acre decline as acreage increases, and capital per acre (the value of equipment and structures) also declines, except for labor for the largest size class (1,000 or more acres) among fruit operations. Moreover, the differences are large enough to be fi nancially meaningful. In each commodity class, larger operations appear to be able to apply their labor and capital to more acres than smaller farms; with regard to capital, that suggests that larger farms get more hours of use in a year. Of course, this pattern may also refl ect a more subtle relationship-that farms that are able to use labor and capital more intensively may also be better able to expand."}, {"section_title": "Leasing, Contract Labor, and Custom Services on Crop Farms", "text": "Tables 6 and 7 report on the labor that farming operations directly employ and the capital equipment that the operations own. But farms may access labor and capital in other ways: Farm Size and the Organization of U.S. Crop Farming, ERR-152 Economic Research Service/USDA \u2022 By leasing capital equipment and structures from dealers or from other businesses that rent out equipment and structures. Such assets are not recorded as assets of the farm business. \u2022 By contracting for workers who are hired, employed, and paid through a contract labor provider. \u2022 By contracting with custom service providers that bring their own labor, and may bring their own equipment, to perform fi eld tasks such as spraying or harvesting. These transactions afford several advantages, including fl exibility to change the size of operations, avoidance of the fi nancial risks of investment in expensive capital equipment, and the freedom to focus on specifi c farm tasks, while relying on custom providers' expertise for other tasks. If larger farmers use these services more than small farms, then an exclusive focus on capital assets and labor provided by the farm may understate the costs of larger operations and overstate their cost advantages over smaller operations. Custom services are used extensively by many corn, soybean, and wheat operations, but (except in wheat) no apparent relationship exists between farm size and the likelihood that a farm will use Larger crop farms realize higher average profi t rates L e s s t h a n 1 0 L e s s t h a n 1 0 0 -0 . 9 -1 . 1. The sample consists of farms with no livestock production (crops only), and primary specializations in one of the fi ve commodity classifi cations noted above. The primary specialization is the commodity accounting for the largest share of farm sales. Farms with livestock were omitted in order to simplify the analysis and focus on fi nancial performance for crops. 2. The numerator of the rate of return on equity is net farm income, minus charges for unpaid operator labor and management contributions, while the denominator is net worth (assets minus debt). The table presents class averages-total returns across all farms in a commodity/acreage class, divided by total net worth in the class. 3. Pooling observations across years provides a larger sample size and more reliable estimates. Source: Agricultural Resource Management Survey, Phase III, all versions, 2008-2011 pooled (17,351 observations: 6,619 in corn; 2,810 in soybeans; 2,079 in wheat; 4,492 in fruits; and 1,351 in vegetables). Farm Size and the Organization of U.S. Crop Farming, ERR-152 Economic Research Service/USDA custom services (table 8). However, larger farms are much more likely to use contract labor or to lease capital equipment and structures. This suggests that table 6 may understate the farm use of labor and capital when all sources are accounted for, and that it may therefore overstate the advantages of large farms regarding input use. However, the bottom panel of table 8 shows that even though larger farms are more likely to incur expenses for each practice, dollar expenses fall sharply, per acre, as acreage increases. If there is a fi xed set-up cost for these items, as well as a component of expenses that varies with acreage, then larger farms could have lower expenses per acre because they are able to apply the contracted inputs and custom services that they hire to more acres per hour of hire. Regarding the intensity of resource use, table 8 reinforces the message from table 6 that larger crop farms appear to be able to apply a given amount of capital and labor to more acres. Producers of fruits and vegetables make extensive use of contract labor, leased capital, and custom services (table 9). In general larger farms are considerably more likely than smaller farms to use each of these practices, but there is no apparent relationship between farm size and the per acre expenses that are incurred for these services. Even when contracted and leased inputs are considered, larger fruit and vegetable farms are able to apply a given amount of labor and capital across more acres, on average, realizing lower costs per acre. Labor and capital on corn, soybean, and wheat farms The fi nancial estimates show continuing advantage to large farms, which should favor further consolidation. However, the pace of cropland consolidation also appears to have slowed in recent years. The midpoint acreage for cropland, measured with data from the Census of Agriculture, nearly doubled between 1982 and 2007, to 1,105 acres (fi g. 3). Data from the 2012 Census have not yet been released, but the midpoint acreage estimated from the 2011 ARMS (see fi g. 1) was 1,100 acres, just 1 percent greater than the ARMS-based estimate of 1,093 acres in 2007 (in fi g. 3), and slightly below the 2007 Census estimate. 10 More defi nitive evidence will be available in data from the forthcoming 2012 Census of Agriculture. Some recent developments in consumer demand may favor smaller family farms. For example, consumer and retailer interest in local food production is growing (Low and Vogel, 2011). Farms that produce for local markets are considerably smaller, on average, than other farms. In 2010, the midpoint acreage among crop farms that produce for local markets was 310 acres, compared to 1,100 acres for other crop farms. Among fruit and vegetable producers, the midpoint acreage was 168 acres, compared to 675 acres among other fruit and vegetable farms. Thus, shifts of consumption Labor and capital on fruit, tree nut, and vegetable farms to local markets, and hence to the farms that supply them, do appear to favor smaller operations. 11 However, farms that sell to local markets account for less than 5 percent of U.S. cropland. Prices for farm products and for energy inputs were extraordinarily volatile in recent years (Baffes, 2013). In turn, that volatility increased the fi nancial risks faced by farmers and by lenders. It also created uncertainty about the future path of Government policy, as policymakers and commodity groups debated the future orientation of crop insurance, commodity programs, and biofuels programs. The risk and uncertainty of the last several years may have slowed cropland consolidation, as farm operators and lenders pause to better understand the new fi nancial climate. 11 The data are drawn from version 1 of the 2010 ARMS (Phase III), where local producers were farms that had direct sales to consumers for human consumption, or that provided crops directly to retail outlets that in turn sold directly to consumers. Interest in organic products is also growing, but organic crop production appears to be concentrated on large farms; the midpoint acreage for farms with certifi ed organic acreage was 1,968 acres in the 2010 ARMS.

Labor-saving innovations-in equipment, chemicals, seeds, tillage practices, and information technology-allow farmers to operate larger farms. \u2022 Changes in the organization of farms.

Scale economies are said to exist if expansions of output lead to reductions in per-unit costs of production holding input prices constant. 12 Scale economies are technologically based, in that they arise from savings in input use, and not because a larger fi rm realizes lower prices for inputs. 13 They may be driven by certain fundamental physical relationships in production and may arise from the higher specialization in tasks that increased production can offer. They often arise because larger production runs may allow for the use of capital equipment, and more capital-intensive production, that would not be viable for smaller production runs. Economies of scale matter for fi rm and plant size in non-agricultural industries. They also appear to matter, over certain ranges of production, in agriculture and particularly in livestock production (MacDonald and McBride, 2009;Miller et al., 1981). Nonetheless, most economists are skeptical that scale economies usefully explain increased farm sizes. Most farms remain fairly small, compared to fi rms in other industries, and crop production still covers a wide range of viable farm sizes. Moreover, because many large pieces of capital equipment are mobile and can be rented out to small operations for modest production runs, multiple small farms can effectively share equipment. Instead of focusing on scale economies, analysts more often focus on labor-saving innovations, which are especially key for agriculture, where most farms are family-operated, with a certain amount of labor available for operation of the farm (Kislev and Peterson, 1982;Gardner, 2002;Cochrane, 1993). Innovations that reduce the amount of labor required for fi eld operations allow Farm Size and the Organization of U.S. Crop Farming, ERR-152 Economic Research Service/USDA farming of more acres. Likewise, innovations that give farmers more accurate or timely information often increase the amount of land they can effectively manage. Labor-saving innovations do not have to explicitly favor larger farms to affect farm structure; instead all they have to do is facilitate the expansion of farms."}, {"section_title": "Equipment", "text": "The tractor remains a primary example of a labor-saving innovation. The fi rst general-purpose tractor capable of operating among fi eld crops was introduced in 1924, and its use spread until around 1960, with tractors steadily replacing horses and mules in fi eld tasks. Olmstead and Rhode (2001) estimate that by 1960 the tractor had replaced 23 million draft animals, and the 79 million acres of land used to grow feed for them were reallocated to other uses. The tractor reduced the amount of labor time required to perform fi eld operations, and required less labor time to maintain than draft animals. Olmstead and Rhode estimate that the tractor reduced the labor required to produce the agricultural output of 1960 by 1.7 million workers, about 24 percent of farm employment in that year. Finally, they estimate that tractor adoption increased average farm size by 58 acres, about 37 percent of the growth in average farm size between 1910 and 1960, as it allowed a single farmer to operate more acres. The tractor wasn't the only labor-saving mechanical innovation introduced during the period. Mechanical harvesters, sprayers, and planters, designed for many specifi c crops, further reduced labor requirements (Street, 1957;Rasmussen, 1962Rasmussen, , 1968Reimund et al., 1981;Whatley, 1983;Calvin and Martin, 2010). In each case, total labor requirements were reduced, leading to reductions in the total farm workforce, but families that remained in agriculture could expand the farm operation with the labor and capital equipment available to them. In some cases, mechanical innovations required complementary biological innovations that created crops that could be more easily harvested mechanically. Since the time covered by Olmstead and Rhode, tractors and other farm equipment have continued to get larger and faster, allowing individual farmers to manage yet more acreage. Bechdol et al. (2010) argue that a farmer could plant 40 acres of fi eld crops in a day using the tractors and planters available in 1970, but 420 acres in 2005, and 945 in 2010, with larger and faster tractors hauling planters that covered far more rows than the 1970 version (table 10). For similar reasons, a farmer could harvest more than 12 times as much in a day in 2010 as in 1970. Moving larger pieces of equipment between fi elds takes more time and expense, and larger pieces also require more setup time at fi elds. For these reasons, bigger and faster equipment is most valuable where fi elds are large, fl at, and contiguous. Therefore, it is more valuable, and has greater effects on farm size, in the Western Corn Belt, the Plains, and the Delta, than in the Eastern Corn Belt, Appalachia, and the Northeast. To see this effect, consider data on recent purchases of very large tractors-500 horsepower or more (which sell for an average price of over $250,000   which is frequently grown on hillier and more marginal land. Moreover, cropland density is much higher in the top fi ve States (71 percent of the land area is in cropland, on average, compared to 43 percent in the next fi ve States and 40 percent for the rest of the country). 15 High cropland density indicates large and contiguous fi elds, where larger and faster tractors will be most effective."}, {"section_title": "Chemical Pesticides", "text": "Pesticides are substances used to control pests, including herbicides for weed control, insecticides to control insects, fungicides to control fungi and other disease pathogens, nematocides to control parasitic worms, and rodenticides for rodents. Pesticides can be synthetic or natural, and they are not the only means by which farmers might control pests. Farmers can control weeds through weeding, either by hand or with mechanical tillage, and they can control pests with management practices like crop rotations and interplanting. 16 The use of chemical herbicides expanded between 1960 and 1980, from 35 million pounds of active ingredients to 469 million, as the proportion of acres treated with herbicides rose to over 90 percent for corn, cotton, and soybeans, and nearly 50 percent for wheat and potatoes (Fernandez-Cornejo, et al., 2013). Fernandez-Cornejo and Pho (2002) show that herbicide prices fell sharply compared to labor and machinery prices in this period, leading to two types of adjustments. First, farmers substituted existing chemical herbicides for other labor-intensive methods of weed control. Second, the relatively high prices for labor and machinery led to more research and development that would generate improvements in herbicides and other chemicals, leading to further substitution of chemicals for labor. After 1980, the total pounds of herbicides applied stabilized and even declined for some crops, as the quality of herbicides improved. Newer substances more effectively controlled weeds with fewer applications, less toxicity, and shorter persistence in the soil (Fernandez-Cornejo and Pho, 2002;Fernandez-Cornejo et al., 2013). When adjusted for improved herbicide quality, prices of chemical methods of weed control continued to fall relative to labor and machinery prices after 1980, and farmers shifted to newer labor-saving herbicides, even as total herbicide applications stopped rising. In their study using annual time series data for the United States covering 1948-1995, Fernandez-Cornejo and Pho (2002 fi nd a strong labor-saving bias to the adoption of herbicides. They estimated that a 1-percent increase in the price of labor relative to herbicides would lead to a 0.23 percent increase in the ratio of herbicides to labor used in production, during the year of the increase. The long-run effect-covering longer term input substitution and the effects of induced innovation-was quite large; a 1-percent increase in the relative price of labor would lead to a 13.5-percent increase in the ratio of herbicides to labor use. Substituting herbicides for labor increased the amount of cropland that a farm family could manage by reducing the labor and management time required per planted acre of a given crop. improvements likely allowed for further incremental expansions in farm size, intertwined with changes in crop genetics and tillage practices."}, {"section_title": "Genetically Engineered Seeds", "text": "Developments in seed genetics have also saved labor, either directly or in combination with other innovations (Gardner, 2002;Cochrane, 1993). For example, mechanical harvesters for processing vegetables, which greatly reduced labor hours, necessitated the complementary development of crop products that could withstand mechanical handling in harvest (Rasmussen, 1968;Schmitz and Seckler, 1970;Reimund et al., 1981). More recently, the spread of genetically engineered (GE) seeds in corn, cotton, and soybeans (fi g. 5) has affected farm production practices and the allocation of operators' time. 17 Herbicide-tolerant (HT) seeds, used in all three crops, allow farmers to apply one herbicide product at a post-emergent stage, thereby replacing several herbicides applied at different times (Fernandez-Cornejo, 2007). Use of HT seeds reduces machine and machine operators' time, as well as the time used to evaluate the need for and plan of weed management. Other GE seeds (Bt), used in corn and cotton, are pest-   1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009  resistant. In principle, they allow farmers to forego spraying pesticides, thereby saving machine and machine operator hours, although some farmers facing infestations may have simply accepted lower yields and did not use chemical pesticides. To the extent that GE seeds reduce the amount of time needed to plan and operate a given amount of acreage, they potentially free time to manage a larger farm. Gardner et al. (2009) analyzed the linkages between labor hours used per acre and GE seed adoption, using ARMS corn, cotton, and soybean data collected in 2001, 2002, and 2003, respectively. 18 They fi nd that adoption of HT seeds was associated with statistically signifi cant reductions in labor hours in soybean and cotton fi elds, but not in corn fi elds, where HT adoption was still quite low in 2001. ERS researchers used ARMS data for 2006 and 2008 to assess the relationship between GE seed adoption and hours of farm labor for corn, cotton, and soybean farms, while controlling for total cropland and the mix of crops on the farm, the use of capital equipment, and the use of custom services and contract labor, each of which can substitute for on-farm labor. (See box: \"GE Seeds and Labor Time.\") 19 Results suggest that farms with acreage in HT crops realized substantial reductions in labor hours, per acre of land. For a farm with 1,500 acres of corn and soybeans, but no land planted to GE seeds, labor use on the farms would amount to 4,421 hours. With all of the land planted to HT traits, and none to Bt, the estimated labor hours would fall to 3,160 hours, freeing 1,261 hours for off-farm work, family time, or expanded farm production. Most farms don't face such stark choices between all or nothing: alternatively, the model estimates indicate that labor hours per acre would fall by 15.5 percent on farms with 75 percent of acreage in HT seeds compared to farms with 25 percent in HT. In contrast, the analysis shows no signifi cant association between Bt adoption and labor hours. 20 If GE seeds save management and labor time, farmers could use the freed labor time to work off the farm or to devote more time to family activities. Earlier research on the topic indicates that use of GE seeds was associated with increased earnings from off-farm employment, for a given size of farm (National Academy of Sciences, 2010). That research, driven by data availability, could access data on off-farm earnings but lacked direct data on labor hours, so researchers could not track whether farmers also used the freed time to expand their farming operation. This analysis described above shows a direct link to on-farm labor hours. Genetically engineered seeds were commercially introduced in 1995, so they cannot account for changes in farm size before that time, and so far they have been used primarily in corn, cotton, and soybeans, so they cannot account for the ubiquitous increase in farm size among many crops. Their effect on corn, cotton, and soybean farms may be limited by the extent of acreage devoted to other crops or by time devoted to livestock production. Nevertheless, GE seeds may partly explain increased consolidation among fi eld crop farms since 1995. Farm Size and the Organization of U.S. Crop Farming, ERR-152 Economic Research Service/USDA HT seeds were approved in 2011 for use in alfalfa, and other GE traits may be available in the future. Like other innovations, they can lead to increased farm size if they are labor-saving. However, other developments may reverse the impact of GE seeds on farm size. In recent years, resistance to glyphosate (the herbicide most commonly associated with HT seeds) has emerged among weeds. If farmers must return to older and more labor-intensive methods of weed control to manage resistance, the effect of GE seeds on farm size may slow and reverse."}, {"section_title": "Tillage Practices", "text": "\"No-till\" has become an important soil conservation practice in the United States. A no-till system leaves crop residue from the previous harvest on the soil, and soil is left undisturbed from prior harvest to planting, except for the injection of nutrients. By allowing for fewer machinery passes over fi elds and fewer machine operator hours, no-till saves labor, as well as capital and energy."}, {"section_title": "GE Seeds and Labor Time", "text": "The 2006 and 2008 ARMS Phase III (Version 1) questionnaires included detailed questions on the use of genetically engineered (GE) seeds and on labor hours for the whole farm. ERS researchers selected a sample of farms from the 2 survey years, consisting of 1,798 operations with corn, cotton, or soybean production but no livestock (most raised other crops as well). Substantial cross-farm differences exist in the share of acreage planted to GE seeds, because of differences in the use of GE seeds for corn, cotton, and soybeans, and because of differences in the acreage of other crops planted on the farm. ERS researchers sought to determine whether farms with higher shares of acreage planted to GE seeds worked fewer hours on the farm. To that end, a simple ordinary least squares regression was estimated, in which the dependent variable was the logarithm of total hours worked on the farm by all operators and other labor. Researchers controlled for total farmland acreage (in logs), the total dollar value of farm buildings and equipment (also in logs), the share of land that was harvested, dummy variables for the use of contract labor or custom services, a dummy variable to distinguish 2008 from 2006, and measures of the share of production originating in each of 15 fi eld crop categories. The measures of GE acreage were the share of the farm's land planted to herbicide tolerant (HT) and to pest-resistant (Bt) seeds. Labor hours were higher on farms with more land, more capital equipment, and a higher share of land in harvested acres. They were lower where the farm used contract labor or custom services and were lower in 2008 than in 2006. Hours varied with the mix of crops. The coeffi cient on Bt was never statistically signifi cant, but it was consistently positive, in this model and in alternatives analyzed for corn and cotton farms separately. Farmers plant seeds with Bt traits where there is a risk of insect infestation, and those risks may cause the farmer to have to use more hours (per acre) on other control practices. In any case, Bt seeds do not appear to reduce labor hours. In contrast, and consistent with the fi ndings of Gardner, Nehring, and Nelson (2009) Gardner et al. (2009) fi nd that the use of no-till is associated with large and statistically signifi cant declines in per-acre labor hours in corn, cotton, and soybeans. HT seeds allow for easier use of no-till practices, and the recent spread of no-till owes something to the expansion of acreage planted to HT seeds. However, these phenomena are not entirely interdependent. While the highest share of no-till acreage is in soybeans, which had the earliest wide application of HT seeds, table 12 shows a rapid expansion of no-till in wheat, which had no HT seeds. 21 Note that estimates are not reported for all years. USDA has not performed annual comprehensive surveys of tillage practices; instead, the ARMS covers fi eld level practices of specifi c crops in different years. To understand the size of the effect, consider a farm in 2006 with 1,500 acres planted equally to corn and soybeans, with no custom work or contract labor, with $300,000 in equipment. With no land planted to GE seeds, the farm would require an estimated 4,421 hours. With all of the land planted to HT traits, and none to Bt, the estimated labor hours fall to 3,160 hours, freeing 1,261 hours for off-farm work, family time, or expanded farm production. This is an extreme example, given the 100 percent GE assumption, but the impact on hours is striking, as well as the implication that farmers with extensive acreage in HT crops could use those hours to noticeably expand farm size.

Specifi c technologies include yield monitors that measure and map intra-fi eld variations in yields at harvest; pest monitors that identify the presence of insects and fungi at spraying; GPS systems that map soil, yield, and pest data and transmit the information to vehicles in fi elds; and variable rate spraying and injection technologies that match the application of chemicals to the intra-fi eld variations in yields, nutrients, and pest presence identifi ed in the other technologies. These technologies, as well as autosteering and guidance systems for tractors, hold the promise of reducing per-acre use of energy and chemicals primarily, but also of labor and management. In fragile tree fruits like apples and oranges, researchers are experimenting with machines that locate and map fruit using a vision technology, combined with robotic machines that take information from mapping machines and use it to selectively harvest fruit as it matures (Calvin and Martin, 2011). These technologies, which may also apply to other crops, allow farmers to increase the value of production per acre, while reducing labor and management requirements. Other precision technologies, such as laser guidance for fi eld leveling and drip irrigation, enhance water management. Adoption of precision technologies has been growing: some type of precision technology was used on 58 percent of wheat acres in 2009, up from 14 percent in 1999; on 49 percent of corn acres in 2005, up from 35 percent in 1999; and on 45 percent of soybean acres in 2006, up from 31 percent in 1999 (Schimmelpfennig and Ebel, 2011). Precision technologies can save on energy, chemicals, and nutrients, and they may also save management time if they allow farmers to gather and retain more accurate information in the course of fi eld operations instead of in separate fi eld visits. Because the innovations are embodied in expensive capital equipment, they also likely create scale economies: that is, given their expense, many of them are likely to only be economical on large operations that can spread their costs over large production volumes or through custom provision of services. So far, most use of precision technologies has involved yield monitors, and widespread use of those has occurred recently, so precision technologies did not play a major role in the past growth of farm size (Schimmelpfennig and Ebel, 2011). Still, their role is likely to grow in the future if they are labor-saving, and more importantly, if they provide farm managers with localized information that they would otherwise only obtain through time-intensive personal inspections."}, {"section_title": "Drivers of Consolidation: Farm Organization and Location", "text": "During the 20th century, crop production largely separated from livestock production, and crop farmers focused on producing a few commodities. Greater specialization provided a spur to increased size, and crop production also shifted toward regions suited for adopting scale-increasing technology. Specialization, and investment in costly capital equipment, can be risky endeavors, and farmers also adopted new methods of fi nancing and transacting to reduce risks."}, {"section_title": "Farm Specialization", "text": "Most U.S. farms kept a variety of livestock in the fi rst half of the 20th century, and they raised feed crops for their animals as well as cash crops for sale. While they became more specialized during the fi rst half of the century, at least half of U.S. farms still had hogs, milk cows, or chickens in 1960 (fi g. 6). The shift away from widespread and diversifi ed livestock production accelerated after that date, and continued through 2000, when less than 10 percent of farms had chickens, milk cows, or hogs, and those that did usually specialized in one species. The presence of livestock affects farm crop choices. In 1900, most farms grew corn, usually to feed to their own animals (fi g. 7). As farmers ceased small-scale diversifi ed livestock production, they also stopped producing feed for their small herds and fl ocks. By 2010, only one in six farms grew corn, and those farms usually specialized in crops, with no livestock. 22 Livestock production concentrated onto fewer farms, and those farms focused on livestock, although most continued to grow some crops for sale and for manure utilization (MacDonald and McBride 2009). Today, almost all poultry production, and most pork and fed cattle production, rely exclusively on purchased feeds, while dairy production combines onfarm production with purchased feed. As a result, most crop production is concentrated on farms with no livestock, focusing on growing a few crops. Commercial markets for feed became deeper, with more transactions and greater volumes of feed sales, as less feed was produced for animals on the farm and more was sold by crop farms to intermediaries for processing and sale to livestock farms as feed components or complete mixes. Deeper markets provided more reliable services, a wider range of desirable feed attributes for purchase, and more certain market outlets for farmers. Crop farmers who no longer pursued small-scale diversifi ed livestock production had more free time available, which could be applied to work off the farm or to expanded crop production on more acres. As a result, changes in farm organization toward greater specialization also provided an impetus for crop farmers who wished to farm full-time to operate more cropland. Once they left livestock production, crop farmers needed to decide on the mix of crops to produce. If all of a farmer's cropland has common soil and climatic attributes, then a single specifi c crop might be the most profi table for the farm, for a given combination of product and input prices. More specialized farms can also realize more intensive use of specialized equipment and structures, and Farm Size and the Organization of U.S. Crop Farming, ERR-152 Economic Research Service/USDA greater accumulation of crop-specifi c knowledge by producers, leading to reduced production costs (Holmes and Lee, 2012). However, specialization carries risks. Specialization may create greater production risks from pest outbreaks, as well as economic risks from concentrated price shocks. Diversifi cation across multiple crops might allow the farmer to reduce the fi nancial risks of relying on one commodity, if commodity returns are not highly correlated across crops. Diversifi cation can provide production advantages if farmers can reduce pest presence and improve soil attributes by rotating different crops through fi eld. Finally, diversifi cation may also allow farmers to more fully utilize their labor and capital over the course of a year, and thereby reduce production costs, if different crops are planted and harvested at different times of the year. U.S. crop farms tend to resolve the trade-off between specialization and diversifi cation by focusing on the production of a few crops-few farms are completely specialized, but few are highly diversi-  1910 1920 1930 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000  Twenty-seven percent of crop production occurred on farms that also had livestock-that is, 73 percent occurred on farms that specialized only in crops (table 13). The incidence varied across commodities-for example, barley, hay, oats, and sorghum producers frequently raise livestock (usually cattle), while little fruit and nut, greenhouse, sugar, rice, or vegetable production occurred on farms with livestock. 23 The table reports estimates of the value of production for the 18 categories, and to construct this table ERS analysts drew on data for harvested acreage elicited in ARMS Phase III questionnaires for 21 crop categories: barley; canola; corn (grain and silage combined); cotton; dry edible beans/peas/lentils; fruits, nuts, and berries; hay (alfalfa and all other combined); nursery and greenhouse crops; oats; peanuts; potatoes; rice; sorghum (grain and silage combined); soybeans; sugarcane; sugarbeets; tobacco; vegetables (processing and all others combined); wheat; other oilseeds; and all other crops.  Twenty-two percent of crop production occurred on farms that produced only a single crop commodity, while 30 percent occurred on farms with two crops. Only 11 percent occurred on farms with fi ve or more crops. Note that the analysis uses just 21 crop categories, and that some categories-such as vegetables or fruits-contain many specifi c crops. Table 13 only captures farm diversifi cation across categories, so production of multiple vegetable crops is not captured in this measure. Farms that produce major fi eld crops rarely specialize in just one-note that less than 5 percent of corn and soybean production occurred on farms with a single crop (that is, only corn or only soybeans). Two-fi fths of production was on farms with two crops (typically corn and soybeans, in rotations designed to maintain soil quality and limit pest infestations), while another quarter occurred on farms with three crops. Moreover, over a third of corn and soybean production was on farms that also had livestock production; on many of these farms, livestock manure is \"fed\" as fertilizer to crops, while the crops are sold and feed is purchased. Diversifi cation in U.S. crop production, 2011 Substantial production of hay (33 percent) and tobacco (30 percent) occurs on farms that grow only those crops, but there is also a considerable amount of production on farms with four or more crops. Sugar cane, fruits and nuts, and nursery/greenhouse operations are highly specialized, but farms can and often do grow multiple fruit or nursery crops."}, {"section_title": "Contracts and Crop Production", "text": "Greater specialization can expose farms to greater fi nancial risks. Today, many farm product transactions are organized through contracts between farmers and buyers that are reached prior to harvest (or before the completion of a production stage, as in the case of livestock), and that govern the terms under which products are transferred from the farm. Contracts can reduce fi nancial risks for farmers by providing a more secure outlet for production and by reducing the farmer's exposure to input and output price fl uctuations. Consequently, contracts may also expand the supply of credit available to producers by providing lenders with the assurance of outlets for farm products, thus reducing the risks of lending (Key, 2004). In each case, the expanded use of agricultural contracts may facilitate shifts to larger farm operations. In ARMS, ERS distinguishes two types of agricultural contracts: production and marketing contracts. Production contracts, used primarily in livestock production but also common in vegetables and horticulture, specify services to be provided by a farmer for a contractor who owns the commodity while it is being produced. Contracts cover (1) specifi c services to be provided, (2) the manner in which the farmer is to be compensated for the services, and (3) specifi c contractor responsibilities for provision of inputs. Marketing contracts are far more important in crop production. They focus on the commodity as it is delivered to the contractor, rather than specify the services to be provided by the farmer. They set a commodity's price or a mechanism for determining the price, a delivery outlet, and a quantity to be delivered. Forward contracts, with a specifi c price set at the time of agreement, are one type of marketing contract. But other types, often of longer duration, specify a method or formula for determining prices, rather than a specifi c price, at the time of agreement. The pricing mechanisms may limit a farmer's exposure to the market price risks. They usually specify minimum acceptable levels of various product attributes, and they often specify price premiums to be paid for desired levels of attributes (such as oil content in corn), thereby providing incentives to produce higher cost but desirable product varieties. Contracts covered 40 percent of all agricultural production in 2011 and 32 percent of crop production, where their use is growing; contracts covered 28 percent of crop production in 2001-02 and 23 percent in the mid-1990s (MacDonald and. Earlier data on contract use in agriculture is sparse, but the Census of Agriculture reports that contracts covered 11 percent of all agricultural production in 1969, which suggests that there was an important shift toward greater reliance on contracts since then. Does contract use affect farm size and structure? Larger crop farms are more likely to use marketing contracts (see also Key, 2004). Table 14 compares attributes of farms that use marketing contracts to those that do not, in each of eight major crop categories. Contracting farms tend to be larger: they operate substantially more farmland than farms that do not contract; they have higher values of production; and they harvest more acres of each crop. Corn, soybean, and wheat farmers who contract tend to place a little over half of their crop production under contract, often in multiple Farm Size and the Organization of U.S. Crop Farming, ERR-152 Economic Research Service/USDA contracts with different buyers. They also combine contracting with cash sales, sales from storage, on-farm feeding, and fi nancial hedging in a broad risk-management strategy. Other contract producers commit almost all of their crop production to the contract, usually with a single buyer. In each commodity, farmers who use contracts for one crop also contract extensively for their other Contract and noncontract U.S. fi eld crop producers, by commodity, 2011 crops, while noncontract producers rely on cash markets. For large-scale producers, contracts form part of a portfolio of marketing strategies to manage risk."}, {"section_title": "The Location of Crop Production", "text": "As livestock and feed production separated, they became concentrated in different regions, and changing regional specialization played a role in changes in farm size. States in the Northeast, Appalachian, and Southeast regions held 18.5 percent of all cropland used for crops in 1950, and 11.2 percent in 2007, a 7.3 percentage point decline that in part refl ected declines in cotton and tobacco acreage (table 15). Corn Belt and Northern Plains States increased their share of U.S. cropland from 43 percent to 50 percent. These long-term acreage adjustments refl ected the organizational shifts noted earlier, and also refl ect important regional shifts in commodity orientation: as farms became more specialized, Corn Belt States concentrated more heavily on the production and sale of feed crops, and livestock production moved from the Corn Belt to Mountain, Southeastern, and Southern Plains (Hart, 2003). Two regional belts of States illustrate the shifts (table 16). In 1950, crops accounted for less than a third of cash receipts from farming in the four Corn Belt States of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, and Ohio. Most cash receipts came from sales of livestock fed on the crops grown on those farms. Corn and soybeans accounted for 63 percent of receipts from crop sales. Sixty years later, livestock sales were no longer dominant: crops accounted for 68 percent of total cash receipts, and corn and soybeans for 93 percent of crop receipts. Those four States accounted for a quarter of all U.S. cash receipts from U.S. livestock production in 1950, but that share fell by half over the next 60 years as beef and dairy production moved out of the region. Those changes refl ected a movement of acreage into corn and soybeans, but also an expansion of hog and cattle production in other regions and the rapid growth of U.S. poultry production, carried out largely in the South. A near mirror shift occurred in a belt of six Southern States of Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina (table 16). Crops accounted for 72 percent of cash receipts in 1950, and most of that refl ected just two crops-cotton and tobacco. By 2010, crops fell to 40 percent of cash receipts as cotton and tobacco declined and poultry and hog production expanded. Together, those States accounted for 17 percent of all U.S. livestock receipts in 2010, compared to 5 percent in 1950. While feed crops are grown in those States, they import much of their feed from the Corn Belt. The interregional shifts in cropland affected crop farm size. Cropland declined in regions with hilly topography and mixed land use-cropland interspersed with forests, residences, and commercial uses-and shifted toward regions with fl atter land and more of the land base devoted to crops. The latter were more suited to the types of equipment that could allow a farmer to manage a much larger farm. As a result, interregional shifts in cropland supported the impacts of new technology in driving production to larger farms."}, {"section_title": "Drivers of Consolidation: Government Policies", "text": "Federal policies may affect farm structure through multiple channels. Some programs may increase consolidation, while others may reduce consolidation. Some effects are straightforward and fairly direct, while others are subtle and indirect. Tax policies can affect prices for capital goods, thereby affecting purchases of farm machinery and structures. Durst (2009) notes that the treatment of agriculture in the tax code, through capital cost recovery provisions, has effectively reduced the costs of capital to agriculture. LeBlanc and Hrubovcak (1986) found that changes in tax policy had important impacts on the cost of capital and equipment investment in agriculture. If lower tax rates lead to lower costs of capital, and if farmers respond by purchasing more capital equipment, then tax policy can enhance technology's effect on farm size. USDA lending programs extend credit to farmers who may not be able to obtain loans through commercial channels, and some programs also provide subsidized interest rates. To the extent that these programs either help new small farms become established or prevent existing small farms from closing, they can limit cropland consolidation. USDA research programs may also affect the availability and prices of technologies, and hence, farm sizes. Schmitz and Seckler (1970) analyze one well-known example, the development of the mechanical tomato harvester. Government provided about 40 percent of the total research and development expenses for the harvester, which once introduced led to the replacement of farm labor with capital and thereby induced a shift to larger operations. Similarly, Fernandez-Cornejo and Pho (2002) argue that public and private research programs to produce improved herbicides generated a labor-saving innovation that allowed farmers to operate larger farms with the hours saved from weed control. Regulatory policies aimed at environmental or food safety targets may alter the relative costs of large and small farms, thereby inducing changes in farm structure. For example, Sneeringer and Key (2011) showed that, after the Environmental Protection Agency imposed size-based thresholds for regulation of concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) under the Clean Water Act, newly constructed operations tended to enter the hog industry at sizes just under the regulatory threshold. During this period, scale economies in hog production were leading to much larger operations (Key and McBride, 2007), so the CAFO rules induced some farmers to constrain farm size, compared to what they would have developed absent the regulation. Issues related to farm structure played a role in the design of the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) of 2011, which gives the Food and Drug Administration new enforcement authorities to improve compliance with risk-based food safety standards. The rules apply new standards for growers of fruits, vegetables, nuts, mushrooms, herbs, and sprouts. When the rules are fully implemented, they will impose higher costs on farms not already in compliance. The bill includes new requirements for testing and reporting that would likely have imposed higher costs, per unit of production, on smaller farms. The Act exempts certain farms from compliance-those that sell the majority of their products directly to consumers or retail outlets within 275 miles or within the same State, and that have annual sales of less than $500,000. Federal commodity programs have been a key focus of discussion among analysts of farm consolidation. The Government operates broad-based commodity programs that affect a range of fi eld crops, as well as several programs aimed at individual commodities. In the case of peanuts and tobacco, marketing quotas regulated prices and production until the early 2000s and appear to have limited farm size (Dohlman et al., 2009;Kirwan et., 2012). Marketing quotas set limits on aggregate supply by giving quota owners the exclusive right to sell a set amount of the commodity at or above a support price within a geographic area. Tobacco producers without quota could not sell the commodity, so tobacco marketing quotas also fi xed annual supply, while peanut producers without quota faced marketing restrictions that left them selling at lower prices to the export and crush markets (Dohlman et al., 2009). Because support prices were set well above cash expenses, quotas became valuable assets that could be exchanged. The transfer of quota rights among quota owners was restricted. In most States, tobacco quotas could not be exchanged across county lines. Peanut restrictions were more complex, but transfers of quotas across State lines were generally forbidden, and transfers across county lines were limited. The programs had been in place with some adjustment since 1930 for tobacco and the 1940s for peanuts. Since then, production of other crops has shifted to much larger farms while also undergoing a series of locational adjustments. Because quotas made such adjustments more diffi cult and costly, they limited geographic adjustment, growth in farm size, and productivity growth. The peanut quota system was eliminated in 2002, and the tobacco system was eliminated in 2004. Each policy change featured buyouts of quota owners. Peanut production came under broad-based commodity program support, while all Federal support for tobacco producers was ended. Each crop saw rapid shifts of production to larger farms and different regions after marketing quotas were eliminated; the shifts to larger farms were much stronger than any previous trends in the sectors, and much stronger than shifts in other commodities. In 2001, just before the buyout, the average peanut farm operated 860 acres in total, with 120 in peanuts; just 6 years later, mean farm size had increased to 1,525 acres, with 227 in peanuts (Dohlman et al., 2009). Average peanut yields per acre rose by 21 percent. 24 In fl ue-cured tobacco, mean tobacco acres per farm increased from 33, at the time of the buyout in 2004, to 84 in 2007, while mean farmland acres rose from 566 to 906. Burley tobacco farms are much smaller, but average burley tobacco acreage rose from 5 to 10.5 acres, and mean farm size rose from 191 to 247 acres (Dohlman et al., 2009). In a detailed study of Kentucky tobacco operations, Kirwan et al. (2012), using Census of Agriculture data, found that tobacco farm productivity increased by 44 percent between 2002 and 2007 (a period encompassing the policy change) after declining by 7 percent in 1997-2002. They found that average tobacco farm size doubled during the buyout period, and that structural change played a major role in driving the increase in productivity. Other factors also contributed to the changes. Many older tobacco producers anticipated the buyout and remained in tobacco farming to be eligible for transition payments made to active growers. As a result, farm closures were lower just before the policy change, and higher just after, than they would have been without transition payments (Dohlman et al., 2009). In peanuts, market prices and planted peanut acreage fell after the buyout, and those shifts had independent effects on peanut acreage per farm. However, in each case, the design of the quota systems suggested that they would have limited farm size, and the rapid shifts of production to much larger farms in the aftermath of quota elimina-Farm Size and the Organization of U.S. Crop Farming, ERR-152 Economic Research Service/USDA tion provide strong evidence that the programs effectively did limit farm size, aside from other more transitory factors."}, {"section_title": "Broad-Based Commodity Programs", "text": "Broad-based USDA commodity programs direct their support primarily to producers of certain fi eld crops: wheat, feed grains, cotton, rice, and oilseeds, and some programs also cover pulse crops, honey, and wool. A redesign of the programs in the mid-1990s made direct payments (DPs) to farmers based upon the acreage they historically enrolled in commodity programs and the historic crop yields from that acreage. The programs also provide countercyclical payments (CCPs), on the same production basis, when market prices fall below target levels and provide for marketing assistance loans, based on current production, that offer support when prices are below target levels. Marketing assistance loans, which effectively set minimum prices that farmers can expect to receive for their crops, have been part of commodity programs in one form or another since the 1930s, while DPs and CCPs were more recent developments. 25 Broadly speaking, payments tend to follow production: farms with greater production of a program commodity-either because they have more acreage of the commodity or higher yields on their acreage-receive greater total payments. There are some limits on the aggregate payments that farm operators can receive, but the limits have not affected many existing operations (White and Hoppe, 2012). Despite receiving higher overall payments, larger farms do not receive systematically higher payments on a per-acre or per-bushel basis than small farms receive, nor do commodity payments represent a higher share of their gross income. Moreover, payments tend to be capitalized into land values, and to raise cropland rents, thus benefi ting landlords and raising renters' costs. They do not provide an obvious direct impetus to increase farm size. However, several authors have argued that commodity programs contributed indirectly to the explosion of agricultural productivity growth, and the concurrent and ongoing shifts of production to larger farms that followed the New Deal introduction of the programs, because of their effects on farm fi nancial risks, farmer behavior, and lenders. Cochrane and Ryan (1976, p. 373) argued that commodity programs \"provided the stable prices, hence price insurance, to induce the alert and aggressive farmers to invest in new and improved technologies and capital items, and the reasonably acceptable farm incomes and asset positions to induce lenders to assume the risk of making farm production loans.\" Clarke (1994) offered a specifi c application of the Cochrane-Ryan hypothesis focused on the diffusion of the tractor in the 1920s and 1930s. She developed a model of the value of adopting tractors on farms, and argued that farms with more than 100 acres of land should have adopted the tractor during the 1920s. Yet many did not, and Clarke argues that the riskiness inherent in farming at the time prevented adoption; before the introduction of New Deal commodity programs, farm prices and incomes varied widely from year to year. In addition, credit markets were focused on short-term loans, and many farmers did not have access to credit-in more modern language, they were \"creditconstrained.\" Farmers, therefore, hesitated to make the long-term fi nancial commitment necessary to purchase durable goods like tractors. Farm Size and the Organization of U.S. Crop Farming, ERR-152 Economic Research Service/USDA The introduction of New Deal commodity programs, according to Clarke, reduced farmers' fi nancial risks by setting fl oors below which commodity prices would not fall. New Deal lending programs made credit more available and also gave competition to commercial lenders, who reduced rates and broadened terms in response to the competition. Improved credit and reduced fi nancial risks led farmers to purchase capital goods and also to make cash outlays for intermediate goods like commercial fertilizers, prepared feeds, and hybrid seeds. With increased and more assured demand for capital equipment, manufacturers invested in improvements to equipment. Clarke (1994) and Cochrane and Ryan (1976) argued that commodity programs complemented and accelerated the spread of labor-saving technology, by hastening the adoption of capital equipment, and may also have affected the types of farmers who adopted new equipment. That position is not undisputed; others see a far greater role for technological advances, often fueled by Government investment in research, in driving productivity growth and farm structure during the New Deal and thereafter. 26 Moreover, farm commodity programs have changed considerably since the period that they analyze. In particular, commodity programs since the 1980s have been built around DPs to farmers, and income stabilization, instead of supply controls aimed at supporting commodity prices (Dimitri et al., 2005). However, the historical analyses are valuable because they focus on the effects policy has on risks; on the responses of farmers, input providers, and lenders to programs that reduce or manage farmlevel risks; and on the consequent effects on farm structure. Modern commodity programs still clearly target the fi nancial risks of farming (Westcott and Price, 2001). With lower risks, farmers may specialize more and may make more commodity-specifi c equipment investments, which may in turn lead to farm expansion. DPs may also give assurance of lower risks to lenders, who may be more willing to lend to producers who already have a guaranteed revenue source through commodity payments. Changes in perceived risks may infl uence farm structure, by infl uencing the adoption of technology as well as farmers' production, investment, and work decisions. Recently, Key and Roberts (2007a;see also Key andRoberts, 2007b, andKey, 2008), hereafter KR, developed an empirical analysis of modern links between farm program payments and consolidation. They used Census of Agriculture data to calculate midpoint acreages for cropland at a highly granular level-postal zip codes-for 1987, 1992, 1997, and 2002. 27 They also used census data to calculate total Government payments per cropland acre, from commodity and conservation programs, for each zip code. Payments per acre vary widely across zip codes, depending on the composition of crops grown in the area as well as historic yields from those crops. KR found that cropland consolidated more rapidly in those zip codes with higher levels of Government payments per acre at the beginning of the period. For example, during 1987-2002, the midpoint acreage farm size increased by 46.3 percent in zip codes with the highest levels of payments, compared to 23.6 percent in zip codes with the lowest levels of payments and 11.2 percent in zip codes with no payments. 28 The association between payments per acre and the growth in midpoint acreages was statistically signifi cant and large. It was also robust: growth rates increased Farm Size and the Organization of U.S. Crop Farming, ERR-152 Economic Research Service/USDA consistently from one payment class to the next, and the relationship held in each time period (1987-1992, 1992-1997, and 1997-2002, as well as 1987-2002). As part of the same research project, KR (2007b), analyzed the linkage between payments and farm business survival. They focused on wheat, corn, soybean, and cash grain (diversifi ed) crop farms and found that farms with higher 1987 levels of Government payments per acre were more likely to still be in business in subsequent censuses. Surviving farms were also likely to grow faster the higher the 1987 levels of per-acre Government payments they received. Each effect was stronger for farms that started out larger, with size and growth measured in acres of farmland. 29 KR identifi ed a robust association between Government payments and later consolidation, but did higher Government payments cause faster consolidation? Three factors weigh against a causal interpretation: Confl icting evidence at the commodity level. Midpoint acreage for fruit, vegetable, and livestock commodities that are not covered by commodity programs increased during 1987-2007 at rates comparable to those for fi eld crops (tables 2-4). That pattern suggests that factors other than payments must play an important role. Marginal association between payments and consolidation. Much of the cropland in zip codes with low levels of payments per acre is idle, devoted to pasture and grazing, or in land retirement programs. These zip codes show very little consolidation. However, in the zip codes where most planted cropland is (and most consolidation), once payments per acre reach a minimal level, differences in payment rates have a much weaker association with consolidation. Omission of alternative drivers. The highest rates of consolidation occurred in the Plains, Corn Belt, and Delta. They have the highest values of Government payments per acre because they have heavy concentrations of program crops and high yields on crops. They also have large, fl at, and contiguous fi elds--land best suited for the labor-saving innovations described earlier. Although KR included several control measures (sales per cropland acre, the fraction of land devoted to cropland, beginning-of-period median size, and locational controls), there is still reason to believe that the association between payments and growth may refl ect the greater adoption and use of labor-saving innovations in those regions. KR focused on the association between Government payments and later cropland consolidation between 1987 and 2002. Signifi cant changes in policy and in commodity markets have occurred since then. In particular, as a result of higher commodity prices and Federal spending limits on commodity programs, commodity programs payments now account for a much smaller share of the value of crop production (fi g. 8). Between 1999 and 2001, Federal commodity program payments amounted to over 20 percent of the value of U.S. crop production. If the value of fruit and vegetable production is subtracted from crop production (since those commodities do not receive support), then commodity payments came to over 30 percent of the value of production. After 2005, commodity payments fell sharply, as a share of production, and by 2011, they amounted to just over 3 percent of the value of crop production (or 4 percent of crop production, excluding fruits and vegetables). Over the same period, crop insurance subsidies rose sharply and by 2011 exceeded commodity program payments. Farm Size and the Organization of U.S. Crop Farming, ERR-152 Economic Research Service/USDA"}, {"section_title": "Crop Insurance", "text": "The Federal crop insurance program has become a major component of agriculture support via premium subsidies and support for administrative costs provided by the Federal Government. Federal subsidies for premiums totaled $7.15 billion in 2012, and Federal support for insurance company expenses were $1.38 billion, by which time the program covered 282 million acres (Shields, 2012). Federal crop insurance was created in 1938 but was limited in scope until Congress expanded the program in 1980 to cover many more crops and regions; in 1994 and 2000, Congress expanded premium support through subsidies and a wider range of commodity coverage. By 2012, over 80 percent of planted acreage of corn, cotton, soybeans, and wheat were covered by crop insurance (Shields, 2012;Glauber, 2013). The Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994 (FCIRA) led crop insurance coverage to increase in the mid-1990s, from about 100 million acres of cropland in 1994 to 220 million the next year. Enrollment fell to 180 million acres in 1997 and 1998 as some initial mandatory enrollment provisions of the 1994 legislation were dropped, but the legislation nonetheless had a major impact on enrollment, which expanded steadily from 1998 to 2008.  The FCIRA provided a natural experiment for analysts interested in farmer responses to risk: expanded premium subsidies led to suddenly reduced production risks for farmers, which varied for different crops and different locations. In two papers, O'Donoghue, Key, and Roberts evaluated how the change affected farmer behavior (O'Donoghue et al., 2009;Key et al. 2006). Farmers can manage the income risks associated with farming by diversifying their sources of income. Working off the farm leaves a farmer's household income less exposed to fl uctuations in farm performance. Likewise, producing a range of commodities leaves household income less exposed to fl uctuations in the performance of a single crop. Each strategy carries costs of its own. Expanded crop insurance, by reducing the fi nancial risks of farming, may lead farmers to reduce their other risk management activities. In O'Donoghue et al. (2009), farms with expanded insurance coverage reduced their levels of commodity diversifi cation slightly-that is, they specialized more-as greater insurance subsidies became available. In Key et al. (2006), large farms reduced their hours of off-farm work after the 1994 legislation, while small farms increased off-farm work. Because off-farm work is a substitute for onfarm work, one can infer that larger farm operators increased their hours devoted to farm work, while smaller operators reduced their farm hours. 30 With more hours to apply to farming, a farmer will likely expand the farm. The net effect would have been an increase in farm consolidation. While the effect on commodity diversifi cation was small, the effect on labor was more substantial-up to 22 days per year for larger farms. These studies likely captured a short-run response, since they covered changes between 1992 and 1997, with the new legislation being passed in 1994. Major changes in farm size-which requires assembling land, capital equipment, and labor-may take longer. A third study (Claassen et al., 2011) modeled the combined impact of Federal disaster programs, crop insurance, and commodity program support on land use changes, through farmer decisions to convert grasslands to cultivated croplands in North and South Dakota. They found that the programs raised the returns to cultivation, thereby increasing cultivated cropland by 2.9 percent between 1998 and 2007. The largest effect was from disaster assistance (1.2 percent) followed by crop insurance (1.0 percent) and marketing loan benefi ts from commodity programs (0.7 percent). By shifting more land from grassland to cropland, the programs would also increase midpoint cropland acreage by a similar modest amount. Agricultural production is subject to substantial production and price risks. To manage the risks associated with greater specialization and substantial investments in capital equipment, many farmers look to institutions for support. Some strategies to manage farm risks, like contracting, have been developed in the private sector. Government commodity and crop insurance programs give additional tools for managing farm fi nancial risks. To the extent that the programs reduce risks facing farmers, they may encourage farmers to invest more in labor-saving innovations and to specialize more in agriculture and in specifi c commodities, which in turn could affect farm structure and help shift production and acreage to larger farms. Farm Size and the Organization of U.S. Crop Farming, ERR-152 Economic Research Service/USDA Family Farms in Today's Crop Agriculture ERS defi nes a family farm to be one in which the principal operator, and people related to the principal operator by blood or marriage, own more than half of the farm business. 32 Family farms are defi ned by ERS only by ownership and operation, and not by size or by labor commitments. Large family farms rely heavily on hired labor, rented land, and contracted services to operate their businesses. However, the defi nition makes an important point: businesses owned and operated by family groups-a specifi c and distinctive type of organization-continue to dominate agricultural production in the United States, even as production has shifted to much larger family businesses. Today, 96 percent of U.S. farms with crop production are family farms, and they originate 87 percent of the value of crop production (table 17). Non-family farms account for less than 6 percent of corn and soybean production; they are far more important to fruit, vegetable, and nursery production, where the 3-7 percent of farms that are non-family operations account for 30-35 percent of the value of production (implying that some are very large farms). But even there, family farms handle 65-70 percent of the value of production. 32 A farm operator makes day-to-day management decisions for the farm business. A farm may have multiple operators. ARMS questionnaires ask for a principal operator, and ask whether that operator and persons related by blood or marriage own more than 50 percent of the farm business, where the business consists of assets owned by the farmincluding land; equipment and structures; inventories of livestock, production inputs, and harvested crops; and liquid assets such as cash."}, {"section_title": "Table 17", "text": "Family farms in crop production, 2011 Family farms can be sole proprietorships, but they are also often organized as partnerships or corporations (table 18). Non-family farms include those operated by cooperatives, by hired managers on behalf of non-operator owners, by large corporations with diverse ownership, and by small groups of unrelated people (often in partnerships or corporations). There is no evidence of any systematic decline in family operations: the shares of farms and value of crop production held by family farms show no trends since the initial ARMS in 1996. Although none of the four large farm fi rms noted at the beginning of this section above could be classifi ed as a family farm, 86 percent of farms with at least 10,000 acres of cropland are family operations. While there are large and complex nonfamily operations in U.S. crop agriculture, and some have been organized recently, there are also examples of large nonfamily corporations that have left farm production in recent years and moved to a coordinating role. For example, Dole Foods once operated extensive farming operations in California and Arizona. Today, it leases 14,000 acres in those States from landowners who purchased the land from Dole. Most of that land is now farmed by independent growers, most of which are family operations, under contract arrangements with Dole. Fresh Del Monte, a major competitor of Dole in fresh fruits and vegetables, has taken a similar approach on U.S. land that it once farmed and now sources primarily from contract growers. 33 These more complex arrangements are shifting agricultural production to family operations, while leaving large distributors as coordinators of production and providers of inputs. The success of family farms in agriculture arises from several factors. First, although technological scale economies exist in many farm production processes, they are rarely large enough or extensive enough to be beyond the scope of a family business (Deininger and Byerlee, 2012). Even in industrialized livestock sectors, where large corporations coordinate most hog and broiler production through their role as integrators, most production is still carried out on family operations under contract with the integrators. Measured scale economies in farm production, while important, appear to be exhausted or largely realized at still-modest sizes. 34 33 See the 2006-2011 annual reports for each company, in sections referring to \"business\" and \"properties.\" 34 See MacDonald and McBride (2009), Key and McBride (2007) for hogs, MacDonald and Wang (2011) for broilers, and Mosheim and Lovell (2009) for dairy."}, {"section_title": "Table 18", "text": "Family and nonfamily crop farms, by legal status, 2011 Second, analysts widely believe that managerial diseconomies of scale set in as farms get large enough to have to rely extensively on hired managers and workers: the fi rm's owners must then closely monitor the decisions made by hired staff (Allen and Lueck, 2002;Deininger and Byerlee, 2012;Gardner, 2002). These diseconomies are thought to be particularly acute in agriculture, because of the degree of local knowledge of soils, nutrients, pests, and weather patterns required to effectively manage cropping and animal husbandry decisions, and because sudden changes in weather or in animal performance demand quick and informed reactions."}, {"section_title": "Challenges for Family Farms", "text": "Despite the historical predominance of family farms as an organizational mode, several factors could undermine this tendency. First, even though families can manage much larger operations than in the past, the land and capital equipment requirements for these businesses may create unacceptable fi nancial risks for many families. With Corn Belt cropland selling for $7,000 an acre in 2012, a farmer aiming to produce 600 acres of corn and 500 of soybeans, close to the midpoint acreages of table 2, would need to assemble over $8 million of land, equipment, and structures. Irrigated California cropland was valued at $12,000 per acre in 2012; a farmer with 300 acres of irrigated fruits and vegetables would need to assemble over $4 million in land, equipment, and structures. 35 Much of this capital may be leased or rented, but the equity and debt required for the owned assets may be daunting; even if feasible, most or all of a family's wealth could be tied up in one risky enterprise. The risks have become more salient in recent years, with sharp fl uctuations in global commodity prices for crops and for energy inputs (Baffes, 2013). While public policies give some insulation in the form of commodity and crop insurance programs, and private institutions in the form of contracting for inputs and products, these movements represent unprecedented volatility for many producers. As a result, operators of large family farms may show more interest in different ways of organizing farm production and accessing capital. They are likely to explore more complicated ownership and management structures for large family farms, with non-operator equity and resource providers, the sharing of assets and services among farms, and more complex contractual relationships with input suppliers and with processors. A second deterrent to would-be family farms may be created by new precision technologies that erode the managerial diseconomies associated with using hired managers and labor, in turn reducing the advantages of close-knit family operations. In livestock production, specialized confi ned feeding operations rely on housing with automated climate controls and sanitation equipment, strict biosecurity procedures, specifi cally formulated purchased feeds, and tightly controlled animal genetics. Those features may have reduced the value of localized farm and herd-specifi c knowledge and improved the capability for monitoring the performance of hired managers, allowing for greater reliance on hired managers, workers, and nonfamily organization Lueck, 2002: Deininger and. Some see such developments emerging in crop agriculture (Deininger and Byerlee, 2012;Byerlee et al., 2012;Boehlje and Gray, 2009). Large fi rms now routinely manage businesses with well over 100,000 acres in South America, Ukraine, and Russia. These fi rms tend to use genetically engi-Farm Size and the Organization of U.S. Crop Farming, ERR-152 Economic Research Service/USDA neered seeds and no-till cultivation techniques to limit the amount of management time expended on fi eld-level weed, pest, and nutrient management decisions. They also use the communications, measurement, and monitoring capabilities now incorporated in precision agriculture technologies to provide the detailed and localized fi eld and farm level information that was previously available only through persistent personal experience in fi elds. They have introduced routines, process controls, and standardized operating procedures into fi eld-level farm management, and they employ highly trained scientifi c and business staff to handle technical tasks. Their size and geographically dispersed operations provide them with opportunities to reduce costs through more intensive use of capital equipment, and they have been able to tap independent investors for fi nancing. Such organizations remain rare in the United States, where family farms still dominate U.S. crop agriculture even as it has shifted to much larger farms. They will continue to do so as long as they are able to limit and manage the fi nancial risks associated with managing large and capital-intensive businesses, and as long as the strengths of family organizations-localized knowledge, quick and fl exible adjustments to changed circumstances, and the incentives to act on each of those-remain necessary to crop production."}]
