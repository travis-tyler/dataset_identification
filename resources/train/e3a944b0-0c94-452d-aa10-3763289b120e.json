It requires advance planning by both the student and his/ her parents. For example, the parents who have high expectations for his/her child's education realize that many advanced level courses require prerequisites. Thus, planning and enrolling in the necessary foundation courses, such as algebra and foreign language during eighth grade, can place a student higher in the math and foreign language pipelines and may eventually lead to decisions, such as applying to college, that are highly related to attending a college.' According to the U.S. Department of Education's white paper, Mathematics Equals Opportunity (1997), students who plan to take advanced mathematics courses during high school and begin to study algebra during middle school are at a clear advantage.' With this potential advantage in mind, this report examines the relationship between enrollment in algebra or foreign language as an eighth-grader in combination with high school course-taking patterns (math and foreign language) with applying to a 4-year college/university. For this analysis, pipeline intensity (see appendix A) variables were created for math and foreign language. The data in this report were obtained from the base-year and second follow-up surveys of the National Education Longitudinal Study of the Eighth Grade Class of 1988 (NELS: 88). NELS: 88 began with a sample of 1,052 schools and 24,599 eighth-graders. While in high school, these eighth-grade cohort members were re-surveyed in 1990 and 1992 to determine their educational progress and school, work, and community experiences. Data from the base-year (1988) and second follow-up (1992, with 12,053 students in cohort) surveys were used in this report (see appendix A for technical detail). The results of this report apply to students who were eighthgraders in 1988 and graduated from high school in 1992."}, {"section_title": "Highlights include:", "text": "Enrollment in gatekeeper courses, such as algebra and foreign language in eighth grade helps students reach higher levels in the mathematics and foreign language pipelines.

For many students, a college education can be very difficult to obtain. For others, though, the process is easier. They are able to apply, attend, and graduate with a postsecondary degree. Why is the process easier for these students? One explanation may be that these students receive an early start in core subjects, such as math and foreign language. Taking algebra or foreign language in the eighth grade may help contribute to students enrolling in high-level math and foreign language courses during high school, which is associated with applying to a fouryear college. In the next two sections, this paper examines the relationships between course-taking behavior in math and foreign language, and applications to college."}, {"section_title": "Enrollment in Algebra and Foreign Language during Eighth Grade", "text": "In America's education system, math and foreign language are known as sequential subjects. Usually, a student does not enroll in calculus before he/she completes algebra, geometry, trigonometry, or precalculus; nor does he/she complete French IV with a passing grade, and then enroll in French I. It is typical for students to begin in the lower-level courses before enrolling in the more advanced classes. Due to the sequential nature of the subjects, it is advantageous for students to initiate these course sequences before high school. Course work in algebra and foreign language during eighth-grade enables students to reach higher levels in math and foreign language during high school.   are associated with these measures of academic success. Twelfth-grade students who enrolled in algebra as eighth-graders were more likely to apply to a four-year college at each level of high school math course-taking (72 percent of students completed high-level math, 59 percent of those completing middle-level math, and 53 percent of those finishing low-level math) than their counterparts at each level who did not enroll in algebra in eighth grade (42, 29, and 24 percent, respectively). As illustrated by figure 2a, algebra in eighth grade is also advantageous when one compares those students who only completed a middle-or low-level math with those who did not take eighth-grade algebra, but completed a high-level math during high school. Twelfth-grade students who enrolled in algebra as eighth-graders and who only completed a middle-or low-level math course during high school were more likely to apply to a four-year college than those This section emphasized the importance of enrolling in eighth-grade algebra or foreign language. It is not only beneficial to reach high levels in math and foreign language during high school, but as represented by the results, it is also important to start taking these courses before high school. For those students who plan to attend a four-year college, it is important to note that most four-year postsecondary schools require students to meet basic requirements in both math and a foreign language course during high school. The aforementioned results indicated that enrolling in either algebra or foreign language in the eighth-grade is beneficial to students applying to a four-year college, but those students who enrolled in both eighth-grade algebra and foreign language are at a even greater advantage. As shown in table 2, 12th-grade students who enrolled in algebra and a foreign language as eighth-graders were more likely to apply to a four-year college than those students who only enrolled in one or none of the courses during eighth grade (78 percent of students who enrolled in both algebra and a foreign language, 56 percent of students who enrolled in either algebra or foreign language and 29 percent of students who enrolled in neither algebra nor foreign language). Conclusion. Not all students who take higher-level math or foreign language courses in high school apply to four-year colleges or universities during their senior year in high school. However, students who do enroll in algebra or foreign language during eighth grade are more likely to pursue a four-year postsecondary education at the end of high school. This is true regardless of the level of math or foreign language attained by these students. For any student who aspires to obtain a postsecondary degree, it is useful for the planning process to commence as early as eighth grade or even before. The results of this study are useful for students who plan to attend college and their parents in determining some of the factors that are associated with their child attaining academic success."}, {"section_title": "NOTES", "text": "Access to Postsecondary Education for the 1992 High School Graduates.

Using the NELS:88 transcript file, they developed the pipeline variables by measuring students' high school course-taking in math and foreign language. This report uses the highest course the student completed in high school. Math Forty-seven courses (see appendix Bnot all courses included on list) were employed from the NAEPequivalent mathematics classifications to determine which math courses to use for different levels (e.g., non-academic, low academic, middle academic, and advanced academic) of the pipeline. For a student to be classified in a certain level of a pipeline he/she must have completed, not attempted, a course in that specific level. First, the math pipeline was divided into four categories: non-academic (basic or general math), low academic (e.g., pre-algebra, two-year algebra 1, informal geometry), middle academic (e.g., algebra or unified mathematics 1, algebra 1, geometry, and algebra 2), and advanced academic (e.g., trigonometry, college algebra, and pre-calculus and calculus). Second, a \"no mathematics\" category was added to the aforementioned four categories, thus producing a five-level pipeline. Because many students begin their high school math education at level four (middle academic courses), middle academic was further subdivided into middle 1 (two years of math including algebra 1 and geometry, or two years of unified mathematics) and middle 2 (one year of mathematics including algebra 2 or a third year of a unified math program). The advanced courses were divided into three categories: advanced 3 (all calculus courses), advanced 2 (introductory analysis or pre-calculus), and advanced 1 (all other courses labeled as advanced, including various trigonometry, probability, and statistics courses). These divisions resulted in the eight-level math pipeline measure: 1 = no mathematics, 2 = nonacademic, 3 = low academic, 4 = middle academic 1, 5 = middle academic 2, 6 = advanced 1, 7 = advanced 2, and 8 = advanced 3. Finally, for the purpose of this report, the pipeline levels were re-categorized into three levels: 1 = low (no mathematics, nonacademic, and low academic), 2 = middle (middle academic 1 and middle academic 2), 3 = high (advanced 1, advanced 2, and advanced 3)."}, {"section_title": "Foreign Language", "text": "Although the NELS:88 transcript file includes data for 30 different languages taken by students, many courses had no enrollment or fewer than ten students. As a result, only four languages were used for the pipeline: Spanish, French, Latin and German. The pipeline measures are on a 0-5 scale in increments of .5, indicating the highest level completed: 0.0 = attempted but \"no progress\" 0.5 = completed .5 Carnegie units of 9thgrade language instniction 1.0 = completed 1 Carnegie unit of 9thgrade language instruction 1.5 = completed .5 Carnegie units of 10thgrade language instruction 2.0 = completed 1 Carnegie unit of 10thgrade language instruction 5.0 = completed 1 Carnegie unit of Advanced Placement language instruction The level assigned to each student depended on how far a student progressed in any language (this report only uses the highest level language completed). If a student completed one Carnegie unit of 10th-grade French, he/she received a score of 2. However, if a student completed 1 Carnegie unit of 10th-grade French and 1 Carnegie unit of 11th-grade German, he/she received a score of 3, because German was the highest level completed. For the purpose of this study the foreign language pipeline was recategorized to low, middle, and high (low = 0-1, middle = 1.5-3, and high = 3.5-5). Variables Used An applied to college variable was created by using F2S60A (has student applied to college) and F2S61 (Type of school student most likely to attend). The new variable indicated a 1 if the student applied to a college or university and thought he/she will most likely attend a four-year college/university. A zero was given to all others.
