[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The increased understanding that neuropathology begins decades before symptom onset, has led to the conceptualization and widespread utilization of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) as an important transitional state between healthy aging and dementia. Further subcategorization to MCI subtype has led to more distinct prognoses and it is widely considered that amnestic and non-amnestic MCI (aMCI, naMCI) likely have distinct pathophysiologies. Yet, accurately classification remains contentious. Here, we differentiate hippocampal subfield volume between subtypes, diagnosed according to stringent clinical consensus criteria, where aMCI is characterized based on deficits in delayed recall (rather than encoding). We then identify memory performance correlates to subfield volume and associations with long-term cognitive performance and outcome. 3D T1-weighted structural MRI was acquired in 142 participants recruited from the Healthy Brain Aging (HBA) Clinic and diagnosed with aMCI (n = 38), naMCI (n = 84) or subjective memory complaints (SMC; n = 20). T1-weighted datasets were processed with the cortical and hippocampal subfield processing streams in FreeSurfer (v6.0). Subfield volumes, and associations with baseline and longitudinal objective memory scores were then examined. Subfield volumes were found to differentiate clinical profiles: subiculum, CA1, CA4 and dentate gyrus volumes were significantly reduced in aMCI compared to both naMCI and SMC. CA1 subfield volume was shown to predict concurrent memory performance in aMCI, while dentate gyrus volume significantly predicted longitudinal verbal learning and memory decline in the entire cohort. Our findings demonstrate that using a more stringent diagnostic approach to characterizing aMCI is well justified, as delayed recall deficits are strongly linked to underlying volumetric subfield reductions in CA1, CA4 and the dentate gyrus, subfields known to be associated with mnemonic processes. Further research is now warranted to replicate these findings in other MCI samples."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), the transitional state between normal aging and dementia, is an important diagnostic entity in both clinical and research settings. Recent studies indicate that conversion rates to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) are as high as 15% over a 2 year period (Petersen et al., 2018) and almost 45% over 5 years (Gauthier et al., 2006; Duffy et al., 2014) . Further subcategorization into the clinical phenotypes of amnestic and non-amnestic MCI (aMCI and naMCI) (i.e., depending on whether impairment is evident in memory or non-memory cognitive domains, respectively) has shown that aMCI is associated with the most pronounced risk of conversion to AD; approximately 50% within 5 years (Gauthier et al., 2006; Petersen et al., 2009) . For those with naMCI, the disease trajectory is less well defined (Jungwirth et al., 2012) , but appears to be linked to higher risk and more frequent conversion to other dementia types (e.g., vascular dementia) compared to those whom are cognitively intact (Csukly et al., 2016) .\nThe aMCI and naMCI subtypes are believed to be underpinned by different underlying pathophysiologies and disease trajectories. As such, to enable the most appropriate clinical feedback for patients (particularly where modifiable risk factors play a role), accurate characterization of the clinical subtyping of MCI and accompanying neurodegeneration is particularly important (Hughes et al., 2011; Norton et al., 2014) . Another pertinent cohort when investigating cognition in aging are those that present with subjective memory complaints (SMC) but who do not demonstrate objective impairment on testing. A recent meta-analysis has shown that approximately 2.3 and 6.6% of SMC will progress to dementia and MCI per year, respectively (Mitchell et al., 2014) . Subsequently, it has been suggested that SMCs may be a \"pre-MCI\" stage in the evolution of normal aging to clinical AD (Steinberg et al., 2013) . By definition SMCs perform within a \"normal range\" on standard psychometric measures and although the individuals themselves, close family or friends, report subtle decline in cognitive abilities, they are otherwise still healthy community dwelling older adults. They are therefore health seeking and as such make an appropriate control group when investigating disease progression in clinic-based settings.\nPathophysiologically, MCI and the early stages of AD are characterized by increased neurodegeneration of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (Frisoni et al., 2010; Mu and Gage, 2011) . Imaging studies have shown that hippocampal atrophy, specifically within the CA1 region and subiculum, not only correlates with cognitive impairment severity (Jack et al., 2000; Morra et al., 2009) , but is associated with increased risk of conversion from MCI to AD (Apostolova et al., 2006; Costafreda et al., 2011) . Although there is increased recognition that aMCI and naMCI are different phenotypes, relatively few studies have investigated the underlying cortical and hippocampal differences between them. Subfield analysis in healthy controls, MCI and AD patients has highlighted the presubiculum and subiculum as possible predictors of memory performance in MCI and suggests that prevalent atrophy of the presubicular-subicular complex is apparent from the early phases of AD (Carlesimo et al., 2015) . Furthermore, significant reductions in whole hippocampal volume in aMCI relative to naMCI and controls has been shown (Csukly et al., 2016) . However, a more in-depth subfield differentiation analysis, in particular with focus on association with objective memory performance has not been carried out in an early stage cohort or between MCI subtypes.\nRegarding hippocampal-dependent memory deficits to categorize subtypes, we have observed that clinicians and researchers have utilized assessments of both new learning and delayed recall in characterizing aMCI (Bondi et al., 2014; Edmonds et al., 2015) . However, our group has applied a more stringent criterion whereby only those demonstrating objective deficits in delayed recall are denoted as aMCI. Those with deficits in new learning, but not in delayed recall, or in other cognitive domains, are classified as naMCI. This deliberate methodological decision can be justified on both neuropsychological theoretical and evidence-based grounds. New learning is heavily dependent on sound and efficient encoding processes, which are frequently impacted by other cognitive skills including attention regulation and executive functions (e.g., with respect to strategic or effortful encoding strategies) that may in turn be linked to prefrontal cortex integrity. Delayed or episodic memory, however, is perhaps more specifically tied to hippocampal functioning and indeed delayed recall measures have been shown to be some of the most highly accurate predictors of progression to AD in both clinical and epidemiological samples (Gauthier et al., 2006) . This more stringent approach to differentiating aMCI and naMCI may therefore be critical to ensuring more accurate diagnosis as well as exploring relationships with neuropathological markers of hippocampal functioning.\nAccordingly, the aim of this study was to (a) determine entorhinal cortical and hippocampal subfield biomarkers that differentiate MCI subtypes and even those presenting with SMC; (b) identify whether our more stringent diagnostic approach is supported by whole hippocampal volumetric differences; and finally, (c) identify whether subfield volume is not only significantly associated with concurrent objective memory performance but also longitudinal memory decline."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "Participants were recruited from the Healthy Brain Ageing (HBA) Clinic at the Brain and Mind Centre, University of Sydney, Australia.

Each participant was required to have subjective and objective cognitive decline, but with the general preservation of function (i.e., only minimal change, if any, in basic and complex activities of daily living).

Consistent with previous studies (Winkler et al., 2014; Csukly et al., 2016) our findings show significant reduction of both right and left whole hippocampal volume in aMCI compared to naMCI and SMC. However, our work extends these previous findings, indicating that specifically focusing on the delayed recall characteristics of memory decline for defining MCI subtypes is not merely theoretical, but is supported by key neuroanatomical differences in subiculum and dentate gyrus subfields. These subfields are heavily implicated in mnemonic consolidation processes (O'Mara et al., 2000) and localized atrophy of these subfields are associated with risk of progression from MCI to AD (Apostolova et al., 2006 (Apostolova et al., , 2010 .\nSignificantly, we have shown that hippocampal subfields in MCI are distinctly associated with verbal memory performance. Specifically, in those with aMCI, the dentate gyrus, CA1 and CA4 were associated with delayed memory recall performance. By contrast, in naMCI, the presubiculum was associated with delayed performance. Moreover, the association between CA1 and delayed recall performance was significantly stronger in aMCI than naMCI. This correlation was still present, but weaker (R 2 = 0.34) when following the \"general criteria\" grouping (results not included). These differential relationships may reflect the varied etiological mechanisms underpinning MCI subtypes. In addition, a recent study (Li et al., 2016) found significant atrophy in left subiculum and presubiculum subfields in a subcortical vascular MCI group (a prodromal stage of vascular dementia) compared to healthy controls.

Significant p values are indicated in bold.\nThis coupled with our results, suggests that the presubiculum may be particularly sensitive to vascular pathologies, which may be more characteristic of naMCI. Importantly, in this study, not only are the naMCI and SMC groups comparable on memory performance, but there were no measurable differences in whole hippocampal or subfield volume. Referring to Supplementary Figure 2 , SMC participants did not form their own cluster in an extended upper quadrant along the linear trend line but fell within the boundaries of the naMCI participants. The lack of observable and measurable difference supports the notion that cognitive change in naMCI is due to more diverse brain pathology, that is less likely attributable to early changes in Amyloid beta (A\u00df). Alternatively, it is equally plausible that both groups may fall earlier in the cascade of dynamic biomarkers of AD, and may still exhibit preclinical AD, according to positron emission tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for AD (Coutinho et al., 2015; Dubois, 2018) . Unfortunately, in this study, such measures necessary for future exploration were not available.\nVarious hippocampal subfields have been shown to play clear and distinct roles in mnemonic processes. Recent functional MRI studies in humans have found localized fMRI activity in the anterior CA2, CA3 and subiculum during learning, and in the CA1, and the posterior subiculum during retrieval of novel associations (Suthana et al., 2015) . This idea of an encoding/retrieval gradient along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus (Prince et al., 2005; Suthana et al., 2015) suggests that our results correlating the volume of retrieval-associated CA1 in aMCI may be functionally relevant. Furthermore, the earliest neurodegeneration seen in AD occurs in the entorhinal cortex and then progresses to the hippocampus. Future work should focus on combining both structural and functional data to investigate the association between not only hippocampal, but whole-brain atrophy patterns, corresponding functional signatures and cognitive performance, thus providing further insight into the underlying mechanisms differentiating MCI subtypes.\nImproved understanding of the specific subfields that correlate with memory decline, will lead to more targeted treatments. Aerobic exercise has already been suggested as a possible promoter of hippocampal plasticity, with studies generally revealing attenuated whole hippocampal atrophy over the duration of intervention (Smith et al., 2010; ten Brinke et al., 2015) . Furthermore, our recent work in an MCI sample found that hippocampal subfields susceptible to volume loss in AD were protected by progressive resistance training (Broadhouse et al., 2017 Abstract Supplement) . Similarly, ongoing work in the field of cognitive training has demonstrated that these interventions can induce underlying neurophysiological alterations in healthy older adults and those with MCI (Belleville and Bherer, 2012; Suo et al., 2016) .\nAlthough AD sensitive subfields were significantly reduced in aMCI and these participants had statistically poorer performance at follow-up, subfield volume is clearly not the sole factor in determining outcome. It has, however, been postulated that the dentate gyrus plays a critical function in mediating processes such as recall of sequential information and short-term memory (Kesner, 2007) . In this regard, our results showing larger dentate gyrus volume at baseline assessment was significantly associated with better follow-up cognitive and memory performance in all groups supports the notion that preserved dentate gyrus volume may be directly or indirectly associated with key neuroprotective factors implicated in preservation of memory function over time. It is in these early stage disease groups where modeling hippocampal volume trajectory preceding memory decline could be most relevant and informative. Further work incorporating both longitudinal MRI and cognitive assessment data is needed to fully understand the multifaceted, transient nature of MCI subtypes and SMC.\nSeveral large-scale studies from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) have highlighted the need for the refinement of MCI diagnostic criteria and have suggested that improved methods may yield gains in biomarker and clinical trial study findings because of improvements in sample compositions of \"true positive\" cases and removal of \"false positive\" cases (Bondi et al., 2014; Edmonds et al., 2015) . From a clinical perspective, our results suggest that screening for MCI should always incorporate measures of delayed memory recall rather than simply relying on new learning or acquisition. Currently, gross screening tools do not incorporate such measures. Recent studies aiming to rate disease progression and score disease state have found that delayed recall is the earliest biomarker to be become abnormal during transition from health to disease (Jedynak et al., 2012) . Our findings suggest that further exploration of clinically useful neuropsychological tools that may detect very subtle memory impairment may be worth pursuing, particularly if they are sensitive to the earliest forms of memory decline. For example, tasks that utilize short-term memory binding (Fernandez et al., 2018) or accelerated forgetting (Weston et al., 2018 ) may be worth examining in preclinical and MCI periods, and in relation to AD biomarkers."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "Although the above reported results suggest a structural delineation between MCI subtypes there are several limitations to consider. Firstly, although we have limited our analyses to corroborated subfields to provide some confidence in our findings, it is important to note that although internally validated from high-field data, the FreeSurfer segmentations do not necessarily represent ground-truth in anatomy and must be interpreted with caution (Iglesias et al., 2015) . FreeSurfer segmentations have not been validated against manual segmentation and without high-resolution T2 data there is a lack of internal information to guide the segmentation template and subfield labeling leading to uncertainty in subfield classification within the hippocampus. Due to the large user base, future studies validating FreeSurfer to manual segmentations would provide more confidence in T1 generated results. Though, as with all MR sequences there are tradeoffs. The improved gray/white matter contrast is achieved with a spin echo sequence -a gradient readout that is inherently longer and resultant contrast that provides less signal or \"entropy\" than the T1-weighted counterpart. Additionally, T2-weighted scans are much more affected by patient motion than the T1-weighted scans (Yushkevich et al., 2015) . Furthermore, to achieve reasonable scan times the T2 sequence is not 3D and as a result has anisotropic resolution (typically 0.4 \u00d7 0.4 \u00d7 2 mm). These factors need to be considered when carrying out subfield segmentation. In a cohort where hippocampal atrophy occurs along the anterior-posterior axis (along the through-plane direction where partial voluming effects will be greatest in the T2-weighted acquisitions) and speed to reduce motion artifacts is priority, the faster, 3D T1-weighted, isotropic resolution sequence may often be preferable. Future investigation of hippocampal subfields in MCI subtypes should implement a combined T1-T2-weighted segmentation method that takes full advantage of the isotropic T1 within the atlas-to-target registration and segmentation pipeline (Yushkevich et al., 2015) . Furthermore, caution should be taken with any automated pipeline, T1-or T2-based, and investigators should always visually inspect their datasets for visible internal structures such as the leptomeningeal tissue in the vestigial hippocampal sulcus that is often used as a segmentation landmark and make it suitable for subfield processing pipelines. Future advancements in imaging acquisition, shorter scan time and improved contrast, will also provide further improvements to segmentation pipelines.\nSecondly, we cannot claim the HBA criteria represents the optimal method; we propose that it represents an important step toward improved clinical classification. Although Supplementary Figure 2 provides a rudimentary visual inspection, this trend was apparent for all performance/subfield correlation plots (not included here). Deficits in delayed recall (aMCI) were linked with significant subfield atrophy, however, reduced subfield volume did not always lead to deficits in delayed recall (e.g., recoded participants). Although discriminant analysis indicated that \"stringent criteria\" grouping led to more participants accurately classified when considering hippocampal subfield volume alone, there is a clear need for further improvement. This lack of clear subgroup classification criteria for a subset of MCI subjects is most certainly due to the current modest understanding of disease etiology, and the poorly understood role of cognitive reserve in this population.\nFinally, the lack of inclusion of a true \"healthy control\" group may limit our interpretation of results. However, by definition SMCs do not display objectively amnestic phenotypes. Although the individuals themselves report subtle decline in cognitive abilities, this is not detectable on conventional neuropsychological tests (which may lack sensitivity for detecting very subtle change) and the SMCs are otherwise still healthy community dwelling older adults. Recent evidence suggests that individuals with SMCs may be at increased risk of dementia and have a higher rate of progression to MCI than non-health seeking older adults (Schultz et al., 2015) . Subsequently, it has been suggested that SMCs may represent a \"pre-clinical\" stage in the evolution of normal aging to clinical AD and might represent a potential target for intervention trials. Such individuals may indeed meet criteria for preclinical AD based on biomarker evidence (Gordon et al., 2018) . As the field of AD has begun to increasingly focus on prevention, earlier detection and diagnosis of the disease has become paramount. Therefore, neurostructural comparison between SMCs and MCI subtypes may be more meaningful when investigating disease progression.\nIn summary, our data demonstrate that structural MRI can aid in the differentiation of MCI subtypes and reveals significant differences in whole hippocampal and subfield volumes between SMC, naMCI and aMCI which are in turn, strongly linked to verbal learning and memory performance. Of clinical significance, our findings further demonstrate that using a stringent diagnostic approach to characterizing aMCI based on predominant deficits in delayed recall (rather than merely encoding) is well justified, as such deficits are strongly and specifically linked to underlying volumetric subfield reductions in CA1, CA4 and the dentate gyrus."}]
