Peter Orton of IBM is quoted by Reamy (2002) stating that \"One of the most important yet least appreciated facts about story is that perceivers tend to remember a story in terms of categories of information states as propositions, interpretations and summaries rather than remember the way the story is actually presented or its surface features\" (Reamy, 2002, p. 1) .\nOntologies and taxonomies help to: (1) share a common understanding of information; (2) reuse knowledge; (3) make assumptions about knowledge more explicit; (4) separate domain and operational knowledge; and (5) analyze domain knowledge (Noy and McGuinness, 2000) . \"Ontologies can be used as an instrument to make knowledge assets intelligently accessible to people in organizations\" (Benjamins et al, 1999, p. 1) . Ontologies are, however, expensive to develop and can be difficult to change once they are in place.\nDue to their complexity and the need for their evolution within a community of scholars and practitioners, ontologies are \"still far from being a commodity\" (Angele and York, 2002) . Ontologies are present in the category systems of websites such as Yahoo, Amazon, and Google (Benjamins et al, 1998; Leake et al, 2003; Noy and McGuinness, 2000) .\nMany disciplines have developed ontologies with standardized vocabularies, including medicine and the pharmaceutical industry. There is a taxonomy of non-profit, organizational entities for the Internal Revenue Service (NCCS, 2004) . There are several taxonomies of businesses, including the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), which was \"developed jointly by the U.S., Canada, and Mexico to provide new comparability in statistics about business activity across North America\" (U.S. Census Bureau, 2004, p. 1) . A new North American Product Classification System (NAPCS) is also being developed and will focus first on service industries, with manufacturing products to be added in the future.\nA standard ontology for news articles called the Applied Semantics' News Series is widely used, based on the International press Telecommunications Council subject codes (Lamont, 2003) . The Library of Congress and Dewey Decimal System classification schemes for bibliographic records are a taxonomy and coding system, as is the ERIC Thesaurus of Descriptors used to document educational materials."}, {"section_title": "II.

First developed in 1971, The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching's classification scheme identifies categories that are \"homogenous with respect to the functions of the institutions and characteristics of students and faculty members\" (Shulman, 2001, p. vii) . Classification reports have been published five times between 1971 and 2001 and a new structure and methodology will be released in 2005. This new edition will \"provide a sophisticated, adaptive set of tools that allows users to cluster institutions in different ways\" with users being given different \"lenses through which to examine and analyze institution mission and other important differences among institutions\" (p. viii).\nSimilar in stature if not in acceptance is the U.S. News and World Report's college rankings effort. Begun in 1983, the U.S. News rankings have evolved from being purely reputational in nature, driven by surveys of college presidents, to include elaborate formula with many complex variables. The tier structure and types of schools represent a category system and taxonomy comparable to the Carnegie classification. While there is great controversy about the methodology and results, U.S. News and other college admissions publishers such as the College Board and Peterson's have \"become part of an integral movement -one that aims to provide the public with ever improving information about higher education\" (Kleiner, 2004, p. 74) . Gumport (1997) and the National Center for Postsecondary Improvement (NCPI) have recognized that there is a \"market for postsecondary education that can be readily described, even quantified\" (Gumport, 1997, p. 23) . However, \"one design would not fit all.\" The NCPI research project found that \"traditional categories for aggregating groups of institutions (size, Carnegie Classification, control) were unable to explain the real differences in student outcomes observed in key national data sets documenting educational attainment and labor market outcomes\" (p. 24). As a result of this effort, a new taxonomy for the marketplace was created and \"the idea and structure of the taxonomy resonated intuitively\" with institutional leaders (National Center for Postsecondary Improvement, 2001, p. xx).\nYet, as Grasel (1999) explains in The Reality of Brands: Toward an Ontology of Marketing, \"The ontology of marketing, particularly the question of what products and brands are, is still largely unexplored\" (p. 1). This is especially true in higher education."}, {"section_title": "Academic disciplines", "text": "Disciplinary taxonomies have been in place for many years. From a national standpoint, these can be traced to efforts by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics and the National Science Foundation's division of Science Resources Statistics. Student enrollment, degrees conferred, and research expenditure data by institution are collected at the discipline level by one or both agencies. A variety of sample survey data about students, graduates, faculty, and employees (especially science and engineering) are also collected from individual respondents, including information about field of study and field of occupation.\nThe NCES disciplinary data were originally collected using four-digit HEGIS (Higher Education General Information Survey) codes, part of the HEGIS data collection system used between 1966 and 1985. \"These codes were updated into six-digit CIP codes\" in 1985, with a \"taxonomic coding scheme for secondary and postsecondary instructional programs.\" CIP codes are \"intended to facilitate the organization, collection, and reporting of program data using classifications that capture the majority of reportable data. The CIP is the accepted federal government statistical standard on instructional program classifications and is used in a variety of education information surveys and databases\" (NCES, 2004a, p. 1) .\nNSF incorporates a three-digit classification scheme in its institutional surveys, one with a finer level of detail than previously offered by CIP codes for science and engineering disciplines, especially medicine. A slightly different three-digit scheme is used for the interagencyfunded Survey of Earned Doctorates. NSF also provides a two-digit list of CASPAR discipline codes to which other disciplinary taxonomies may be rolled up for aggregate data These are available as part of its WebCASPAR online data tool. NSF incorporates several crosswalks between different disciplinary taxonomies, including CIP, HEGIS, and occupation codes, in Web-CASPAR.\nMany other efforts to map the academic disciplines have been created and are in use today, including those of the National Research Council, the Council of Graduate Schools, Peterson's, the College and University Personnel Association, and other organizations, agencies, and associations. Whether collecting data on enrollment, degrees, faculty, salaries, research expenditures, or equipment, each of these must include some form of disciplinary taxonomy. For their internal use, most colleges and universities map their departments to the reporting requirements of NCES using CIP codes. States regulate the approval of majors and programs with degree inventories that typically combine CIP code and award level.\nDespite these many efforts, it requires extreme care to maintain the currency of these taxonomies. The nature of disciplinary work is becoming more fragmented and compartmentalized into specialized academic niches and fields of research. In order to understand supply and demand issues and the emergence of new knowledge and research, there must be a concerted dialogue about these taxonomies. Much of their evolution is due to mandated reporting requirements which, while sufficient for many purposes, fail to address cutting edge changes because they are often too gross in their level of detail. It is then up to disciplinary bodies to track the nature of their professions through refining data collections over time. Fortunately, web survey software is now more widely available and the result is that it is less expensive for disciplinary associations to conduct this needed work in this disciplinary ontology of higher education."}, {"section_title": "Documentation of data", "text": "In their efforts to promote best practices to improve data collection and reporting, several national organizations have developed standard taxonomies for higher education data. The National Center for Higher Education Management Systems (NCHEMS) has incorporated disciplinary and department data in its vision of resource allocation models since the 1970s, promoting the use of crosswalks between human resource, student, course, and finance data through organ-izational mapping. It is impossible to conduct complex cost of instruction models without disciplinary taxonomies and departmental crosswalks and NCHEMS has spearheaded this effort for thirty years. Crystal and Jones (1985) expanded the early NCHEMS work to focus on accreditation, with their monograph A Common Language for Postsecondary Accreditation: Categories and Definitions for Data Collection. One of the early NCHEMS products was its NCHEMS Data Element Dictionary (Thomas, 1971) . A new version of Data Definitions for Colleges and Universities was released in a joint effort of NCHEMS and the Consortium for Higher Education Software Services (CHESS). CHESS was designed to foster agreement on terminology and definitions, standardize definitions, and help structure information architecture for an institution. It was released on CD-Rom in Microsoft Access.\nCHESS includes several components -(1) data definitions; (2) MetaData Administrator software to maintain institutional files; and (3) the CHESS taxonomy. The taxonomy was first published in 1994 as the CHESS Taxonomy of Administrative Activities for Colleges and Universities and was updated with the second edition released in 2004. It provides \"a comprehensive annotated list of academic and administrative activities at a typical college or university. It also provides a detailed guide for categorizing and describing the operations of colleges and universities and the activities that relate to information technology support\" (Thomas, 2004, p. 2) . There are five levels of hierarchy in the taxonomy, starting with major functional area.\nAnother national effort to promote effective data practices is that of the National Postsecondary Education Cooperative (NPEC). NPEC was authorized by Congress in 1994 to promote the quality, comparability and utility of postsecondary data and information that support policy development at the federal, state, and institution levels. NPEC receives funding from NCES and as part of its focus on \"Quality Data Practices\" has undertaken a variety of taxonomy-related projects. These include the work of an NPEC Working Group on \"Best Practices for Data Collectors and Data Providers\" that asked \"What can be done to better coordinate data definitions and surveys on a national basis to achieve greater comparability and relieve institutional data burden?\" (NPEC, 1999) . Other related NPEC projects include an \"Examination of the Data Requirements of the Workforce Investment Act and the Perkins Act of 1998,\" a study of \"Technology and Its Ramifications for Data Systems,\" and an analysis of \"Unit Record Versus Aggregate Data: Perspectives on Postsecondary Education Data Collection, Retention, and Release.\"\nAnother long-term effort of NPEC is the ANSWERS (Accessing National Surveys with Electronic Research Sources) website, which includes a variety of online tools to help different types of users or audiences find the data and developer resources they need. At the heart of ANSWERS is a matrix of data dictionary information about almost 25,000 variables from over 110 datasets. Each of these data elements is content analyzed and coded using the unique ANSWERS taxonomy that was developed especially for this purpose, with over 340 subject/topic combinations. ANSWERS is no longer available online as part of the NPEC website, but is maintained by the developer at http://highered.org/answers.\nWithout a tool of this type, it is impossible to keep up with the availability of complex population and survey data about postsecondary education. ANSWERS also includes references to key citations about developing surveys and using national datasets. It includes a Question Bank of questions used in sample surveys of faculty and students and a Definition Bank of standard glossary terms and definitions. Hard-to-find information about surveys is also included, with information such as average response rates and handling of missing data. With a combination of search and category-driven tools, ANSWERS is an important ontology resource for higher education."}, {"section_title": "Learning management systems (LMS)", "text": "Recognizing that information about learning must be shared between different computer systems, various groups have developed metadata standards about learning management systems (LMS). In the U.S., the National Learning Information Infrastructure and other standards boards are promoting standards for learning courseware. In Europe, ARIADNE and ELENA are examples of applications that support the exchange of knowledge resources.\nAn early EDUCAUSE article from 1997 spells out the vision and promise for metadata:\nThe primary purpose of metadata is to provide more helpful information about a work than can be obtained by inspecting the contents of the work, e.g., a Web page may be designed to teach mathematics skills to a third grade audience, but the terms \"third grade\" and \"mathematics\" may not appear in any of the text of the Web page. Therefore, traditional Web search engines, which often utilize full-text search indexes, would not return the page if \"third grade and mathematics\" were used as the search criteria.\nStandards for metadata allow information and materials to be easily and consistently located. Unfortunately, where metadata solutions exist today, they are not consistent and are often proprietary. This has created an administrative nightmare for organizations that own or manage large collections of Web-based materials. It is these administrative challenges and the potential benefits to users that are driving the Internet industry to solve this metadata problem. The NLII IMS is building upon the industry's technology efforts by defining the necessary metadata elements to support widespread reuse, discovery and sharing of learning materials via the Internet (Griffin and Wason, 1997, p. 1) .\nSince 1997, the National Learning Information Infrastructure (NLII) project has made great progress in defining standards for metadata for instructional management systems (IMS). The NLII Annual Review for 2003 documents the current key themes, among them learning materials, software, and service markets; learning objects; and specifications/standards development (NLII, 2004) . Metadata standards have now been developed and disseminated and are being implemented widely by developers and institutional IT staff for documenting courseware and learning objects.\nNew types of Peer-to-peer (P2P) software such as Edutella use the Universal Brokerage Platform to share learning objects across web servers. All of these developments are taking place because an infinitely growing array of learning objects are becoming available in all media types and modes of delivery. Organizational users won't be able to take advantage of them, however, unless there is a common taxonomy for documenting their availability.\nLearning Object Metadata (LOM) are used to define a \"Base schema that defines a hierarchy of data elements for learning objects metadata\" (Ogbuji, 2003, p. 1) . These metadata schema must incorporate many types and categories of information, including:\n\u2022 General information \u2022 Lifecycle -\"features related to the history and current state of this learning object and those who have affected this learning object during its evolution\" \u2022 Meta-Metadata -\"information about the metadata instance itself\" \u2022 Technical -technical requirements and characteristics \u2022 Educational -\"educational and pedagogic characteristics\" \u2022 Rights -\"intellectual property rights and conditions of use\"\n\u2022 Relation -\"features that define the relationship between the learning object and other related learning objects\" \u2022 Annotation -\"comments on the educational use of the learning object,\" including \"when and by whom the comments were created\" \u2022 Classification -\"describes this learning object in relation to a particular classification system\" (Ogbuji, 2003, p . 1).\nWiley (2000) presents a taxonomy to \"differentiate possible types of learning objects available for use in instructional design.\" The \"taxonomy's characteristics' values (such as High, Medium, and Low) are purposefully fuzzy, as the taxonomy is meant to facilitate inter-object comparison, and not to provide independent metrics for classifying learning objects out of context\" (Wiley, p. ?).\nLearning objects or knowledge chunks represent the most efficient focus of technology in teaching. By focusing on serving and finding learning objects, faculty no longer have to fight for scarce resources. The first steps have been taken with the development of standards for learning object metadata and instructional management systems. Now steps are being taken to build new types of learning object repositories. These require complex taxonomies and new types of search engines which combine the best features of searching and classification."}, {"section_title": "The higher education enterprise", "text": "Halstead's (1979) Higher Education Planning: A Bibliographic Handbook was published in the era when higher education administration was first becoming a professionalized field of study. This document, along with Higher Education: A Bibliographic Handbook Volume II (1981) helped to establish and map the knowledge based of the higher education enterprise, from admissions to space management to student affairs.\nTwenty-five years later, the enterprise of higher education is being mapped in new ways, with great interest in virtual colleges and universities (VCUs). Epper and Garn (2004) cite the work of Wolf and Johnstone, whose \"taxonomy classifies VCUs along a dimension of collaboration ranging from independence to highly distributed collaboration\" (p. 34).\nThe CHESS taxonomy documents the myriad departments and organizational units which exist in typical institutions. From financial information systems which must include a chart of accounts that is mapped into departments and units, to course and student data with alpha codes used to describe majors and academic departments, numerous taxonomies are implemented throughout the higher education enterprise.\nThe U.S. Department of Education's HEGIS surveys of financial data were the first attempt to categorize types of expenditures and revenues into an agreed-upon taxonomy. The newest IPEDS data categorize finance data in different ways, depending upon the implementation of new required forms from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). Unfortunately, as stated by the NCES documentation for the IPEDS Finance survey, \"As data users attempt to compare institutions that cross accounting models, it becomes difficult to put them on the same scale. Some accounting differences cannot be adjusted for, but an understanding of them may help\" (NCES, 2004b, p. 1).\nThe National Association of College Auxiliary Services (NACAS) developed its own taxonomy several years ago.

All of these systems require developers to make assumptions about how resources will be presented to the user. Some applications are customized and presented based on data from user-compiled profiles. Others are based on the audience, for example portals with categories of links geared to new students, parents, alumni, and the media.\nAs online resources are created and integrated into existing applications for admissions, registration, online courseware, and faculty advising, they all need to be categorized. Content management systems are used behind-the-scenes to manage the thousands of web pages and database structures necessary for a complex university or college setting. These systems must have a sophisticated and dynamic taxonomy. While much of the portal and administrative information system software delivers a foundation for these categories and ontology, they are only a starting point. For as the emergence of Google and the new breed of search algorithms points out, search techniques only go so far to providing relevant resources. Subject matter experts and others must be used to create taxonomies for the Web that make sense within the context of higher education and within the unique institutional setting. It is critical that developers recognize and document their assumptions about taxonomies when implementing portals, Intranets, and even basic websites for a department or unit. Simple questions such as \"How are you going to categorize new information on the site?\" can be very difficult to answer."}, {"section_title": "III. Issues in Creating Taxonomies", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Search retrieval and content management", "text": "Bernbom writes that KM involves the \"discovery and capture of knowledge, the filtering and arrangement of this knowledge, and the value derived from sharing and using this knowledge throughout the organization\" (2001, p. xiv). While KM proponents share this goal, organizations are still overwhelmed by the need to \"rapidly analyze and classify unstructured information.\" This is the result of many forces, including staff retirements and turnover, budget cutbacks, an unqualified labor pool, lack of skills and/or training, and changing mission. However, problems of staffing and the continuity of knowledge within an organization become exacerbated because explicit information is often not readily available and is maintained out of context.\nRecognizing that there is \"too much information out of context,\" it is difficult to \"discern high-quality, relevant information from hearsay, inaccurate, unqualified, or outdated information\" (Delphi Group, 2003, p. 2) . It is also difficult to capture and communicate tacit information. At the heart of documenting knowledge assets is the work of content management. Content and process are \"inextricably linked\" and many KM proponents believe that \"Content Management is all that matters\" (Moore, 2003, p. S2) . Whether stored in file cabinets, electronic filing systems, document management systems, Intranets, portals, or KM repositories, the critical issue is finding and using content.\nBoth search engines and ontologies have undergone a significant evolution in the past few years as users became inundated with millions of websites on the World Wide Web and expectations for relevant search results have grown with tools such as Google. With \"exponential growth in the amount of data available across the globe,\" search engines \"return such large numbers of irrelevant results that frustration persistently triumphs\" (Inxight, 2003, p. 3 ).\nMajor problems with search engines involve: (1) making results relevant; (2) ensuring secure and efficient collection of a breadth of data; (3) allowing various language methods for imputing information; and (4) the ability to scale a search product to very large indexes and volumes of queries (Andrews, 2003) . Taxonomies are \"often used in tandem with search and retrieval tools\u2026 However, unlike search technology alone, taxonomies reveal the overall structure of a knowledgebase in a hierarchy that is visible to the user\" (Lamont, 2003, p "}, {"section_title": ". 1).", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Creating ontologies", "text": "There are two activities involved in creating ontologies: (1) coding new documents into a beginning taxonomy; and (2) modifying the taxonomy to handle new types of information. These usually occur \"through a combination of automation and human intervention. Classification techniques include keywords, statistical analyses that look for patterns of words, and use of a semantic network or ontology that analyzes words for the meaning in context\" (Lamont, 2003, p. 2) . Verity and other search engine tools incorporate auto-classification to generate rules for categories using sample documents. Ontologies have been a central discussion of the artificial intelligence community (Kalfoglou, 2000) . Noy and McGuinness (2000) explain that \"The ontology should not contain all the possible information about the domain: you do not need to specialize (or generalize) more than you need for your application (at most one extra level each way)\" (p. 19). The authors break ontologies into information about classes, subclasses, slots, and instances. Most ontology discussion focuses on classes, which \"describe concepts in the domain\" or subject area.\nFor example, a class of wine represents all wines. Specific wines are instances of this class. The Bordeaux wine in the glass in front of you while you read this document is an instance of the class of Bordeaux wines. A class can have subclasses that represent concepts that are more specific than the superclass. For example, we can divide the class of all wines into sparking and non-sparkling wines.\nSlots describe properties of classes and instances: Chateau Lafitte Rothschild Pauillac wine has a full body; it is produced by the Chateau Lafite Rothschild winery. We have two slots describing the wine in this example: the slot body with the value full and the slot maker with the value Chateau Lafite Rothschild winery. At the class level, we can say that instances of the class Wine will have slots describing their flavor, body, sugar level, he maker of the wine and so on\" (Noy and McGuinness, 2000, p. 3).\nThe steps to developing an ontology therefore include: (1) defining classes; (2) arranging the class into subclasses within a hierarchy; (3) defining slots and the possible value labels for them; and (4) documenting specific instances using the slot value labels (Noy and McGuinness, 2000) .\nNumerous efforts are underway to develop a standard ontology for application on the Internet. The Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO) exists to help in building ontologies and includes over a thousand concepts that are \"interconnected into [a] semantic network\" with over 4,000 axioms (Ahrens and Huang, 2003; Niles and Pease, 2001; Sevcenki, 2003 ). An online tool called the SUMO Browser is available to help users navigate and use the SUMO."}, {"section_title": "IV.

Subject matter experts (SME) need to be closely involved in creating taxonomies and concept maps, according to Venkata (2002) . Experts \"play an active role in the knowledge capture process,\" explain Leake et al (2003) .\nSome software tools such as Convera's Retrievalware are able to develop a taxonomy dynamically. This \"combines searching with classification to produce dynamic classification\" (Lamont, 2003) . The Convera product literature states that \"Users can launch and automatically classify the results based on pre-defined or dynamically generated classifications. The underlying taxonomies can consist of Convera's pre-packaged industry taxonomies, customer defined taxonomies or custom taxonomies\" (Convera, 2004, p. 4) . The benefit of this process is that \"Rather than being forced to fit searches within the constraints of inflexible categories, users can create their own information categories based on the context of their search at the moment\" (Convera, 2004, p. 5) . The query results are presented as a hierarchy of classification folders.\nRetrievalware software also offers searching by concept, pattern, and Boolean strings (and/or/not). The concept search \"does what we naturally do in conversation with each otheraccount for the individual differences in the way we express similar ideas.\" The pattern search uses a \"sophisticated vote and rate scheme that considers a number of different features of the pattern instead of just character pairs.\" The Boolean search incorporates \"advanced linguistic analysis to ensure high precision and recall\" (Convera, 2004, p. 3) .\nOther software such as The Texis Categorizer \"assigns documents to the categories in a taxonomy and automatically attaches subject codes and other metadata after being trained on sample documents.\" There needs to be a \"close and interactive relationship between categorization and search\" (Lamont, 2003, p. 6) The importance of pattern and concept mapping is illustrated in an example about effective electronic communications compliance in financial services. Compliance personnel need to \"proactively identify patterns of suspicious activity. For example the phrases 'IPO' and 'preferred customer' appearing within separate but related documents may have little apparent connection to one another\" (Delphi Group, 2002, p. 3) . It is their proximity and relationship in the same document which help compliance staff find the next Martha Stewart policy breach.\nThis linguistic approach to mining the results of searches is part of a larger effort to create a \"real Semantic Web\" (Kasteren, 2003) . The Inxight SmartDiscovery software tool is based on work done at Xerox and \"automates the creation of structure on otherwise unstructured data sources by leveraging more than 20 years of research in natural language processing and data visualization techniques\" (Inxight, 2004, p. 2) ."}, {"section_title": "Problems and issues in maintaining taxonomies", "text": "The greatest problem encountered with these automated processes is that taxonomies must be dynamic and changing. Venkata (2002) describes how developers must refine and enhance taxonomies by:\n\u2022 Adding new topics to capture changing relationships between informational resources being classified, reflecting new subject domains that the taxonomy must accommodate; \u2022 Optimizing the taxonomy structure to more accurately reflect both the informational content as well as organizational requirements; \u2022 Deleting and/or aggregating topics that are no longer of value;\n\u2022 Increasing topic coherency and optimizing statistical training sets to maintain or enhance classification accuracy as content changes over time (Venkata, 2002 , p.

These include technological risks, including tool support, maintenance, and scaling up; and social and organizational risks, including the need for a minimum number of participants in creating a taxonomy, the climate of competitive mentality, and incentive systems. Collaborative thinking about ontology needs to be free of a competitive environment, according to the authors. An incentive system is necessary because \"Given the high workload of today's employees, it may be easily felt that contributing to a knowledge management effort is a waste of time, or at least does not have priority\" (Benjamins et al, 1998, p. 17 ).\nThere are many more issues to consider in constructing ontologies and the reader is referred to the website of Sowa (2004) , who discusses many issues, including:\n\u2022 the relationships of process types \u2022 distinctions in roles and relations \u2022 causality \u2022 agents \u2022 thematic roles \u2022 alignment of concepts, relations, and commonalities between ontologies \u2022 properties, features, and attributes to differentiate categories \u2022 hierarchy \u2022 identity conditions"}, {"section_title": "Concept Maps", "text": "Papadopoullos (2003) discusses how \"The relations between terms help to describe the conceptual interactions between words or expressions and thus will directly impact precision and recall\" (p. 9).

Milam et al (2000) and Carnot et al (2003) describe the use of concept maps in educational software applications. Milam et al explain that:\nEven with clear assumptions and good qualitative research methodology, there are a myriad of ways to create a single type of map of the same content. It is important to either involve a group of scholars in developing a map and/or to recognize that the resulting map is simply a pattern for documenting the links between complex ideas. The groupware features for the collaborative creation of concept maps have great potential for developing these consensual maps and need to be explored further within an education context (Milam et al, 2001 , p. 63).\nBenjamins et al (1998) explain how ontologies can be represented visually through software such as Ontobroker, which displays a hyperbolic query interface. Clicking on the main node takes the user to related classes. \"Ontology browsing\" involves a visual representation of a taxonomy, based on the principles of hyperbolic geometry. \"This visualization technique allows a quick navigation to classes far away from the center as well as a closer examination of classes and their vicinity. Classes can be dragged around while the size of the visualization nodes changes corresponding to their location, that is, the more centric the bigger they appear\" (Benjamins et al, 1999, p. 7). Leake et al (2003) explain that concept maps are similar to \"vector-space models\" in the way that knowledge is represented. Some systems are weighted, with higher weights given to top keywords. These systems can \"consider the number of outgoing and incoming links to a concept node, strengthening the weights of keywords in nodes for concepts with many connections to other concepts in the map\" (p. 5). In generating and suggesting new concepts using data mining techniques, the CMapTools software lets users \"control how far the retrieval algorithm descends in the hierarchy tree to search for related concept maps\u2026\" (p. 5). A \"keyword correlation metric\" is used that measures the distance between concepts on a map. These and other automatic categorization techniques help present relevant topics to the user. There are limits to the results, however, and other scholars have created software such as EXTENDER (Extensive Topic Extender from New Data Exploring Relationships) that \"identifies and suggests novel topics\" (Leake et al, 2003) ."}, {"section_title": "Specific issues in taxonomies for higher education", "text": "In practice, the development of taxonomies for higher education is a much more imprecise process than is suggested by the previous discussion of dynamic classification software and semantics for the web. The following section addresses very specific issues in taxonomies related to the author's experience with portals, campus-wide information systems, cataloging Internet resources, disciplinary taxonomies, and using national datasets.\nPortal developers, whether open source or vendor-driven, have not evolved elaborate and complex categories for providing links to web resources. The department, college, and university staff who build websites often do not understand the principles of content management. Many of these sites are not database-driven, which provides a mechanism for standardization. This work is done piece-meal, in a haphazard fashion using student workers, and without much foresight about managing site content and appearance over time. The website taxonomy, if there is one, is changed only when there is a site makeover, and often this process is compressed into a timeframe that leaves little time for reflection and analysis of site navigation problems, much less user input.\nAlmost all colleges and universities have a web presence. This is different from portals geared to different sets of user needs and applications and from Intranets with administrative information systems for operations. Campus-Wide Information Systems (CWIS) are the most visible symbol of an institution on the Internet and must represent many perspectives. There are inherent categories of content for a CWIS, from special audience pages to lists of academic departments to topical information such as directions, admissions, and student services. In the author's experience, the choice of categories is often a political process, geared not so much to usability and the needs of a majority of users as to the images and perception which the institution wants to promote as its public \"face.\" In Milam's study of the \"politics of websites,\" the conclusion emerged that CWIS are a form of sense-making, focused more on aspirational ideas than reality.\nAnother taxonomy developed by the author is the website Internet Resources for Institutional Research, which has been maintained since 1995 and includes thousands of links in numerous categories. When begun, there were few efforts to catalog the web by subject area and there were few links related to higher education, so the job was relatively easy. With a growing number of links, it became necessary to implement a rudimentary cataloging system. Hundreds of links were grouped by subject on single page. With interest in listservs, institutional fact books, and institutional research office websites, special pages were added and kept up separately. By 1997, an Access database was developed and ColdFusion software was used in a menu structure to document and serve over 100 pages by topic. Any link could be coded with multiple topics. Attempts were made to share the upkeep process with other volunteers, but the decision rules for coding and editing links were not made explicit. At some point, certain categories were hot, such as web database information; while others were little used. The site and work benefited when the ERIC Clearinghouse for Higher Education began linking to specific pages within the site.\nThe Internet Resources website should have deleted unnecessary categories and continued to evolve new ones, but the process was time-consuming. Briefly, the site was turned over to part-time staff of the Association for Institutional Research to maintain, but this was never fully implemented and the expectations of the author were not communicated clearly. The site is still maintained and new links are added and bad links removed. The evolution of the taxonomy is stalled due to the amount of effort needed to maintain it correctly. This requires the author's or other's subject matter expertise and a degree of discernment about relevance and interest to users. Any link changes or additions provided by users are made quickly, but the vision for Internet Resources has not been modified since the late 1990s. While it is highly used by institutional researchers and some faculty who teach higher education administration, it badly needs a makeover.\nThe work of NCHEMS, NCES, and NSF provides badly needed standards for data collection that implement de facto taxonomies. However, these are typically five or more years out of date, owing to the development and approval processes involved. They are more often a map of where higher education has been, not where it is going. The recent release of the CIP Code 2000 disciplinary taxonomy is a case in point. By the time the 2000 CIP Codes were developed, reviewed, made available for comment, finalized, approved, and implemented into the software architecture of collections of student and degree data, it was already obsolete. There were thousands of changes, however, between CIP 1990 and CIP 2000 and the upgrade involved a massive effort. It is important to recognize the development of complex taxonomies as an evolutionary process.\nIn developing the taxonomy of subject and topic codes used for the NPEC ANSWERS project, the author found himself immersed in ontology issues. Relying on the principles of naturalistic inquiry, polychotomous coding categories were developed. These were not mutually exclusive, but allowed for multiple, redundant coding of variables into different combinations of subject and topic. It was recognized that hierarchical models make inherent value judgments about the best way to describe a piece of data. Therefore, every effort was made to categorize variables in as many ways as possible. The most difficult part of this work was the re-work needed after a new coding category was added. This required that all previous variables be analyzed to see whether they could also be coded under the new category. This is a routine part of content analysis, the constant comparative method, and ethnography. Special software was developed to import, export, pre-select, and anticipate coding categories based on previous variables.\nRecently, approximately 5,000 variables from NCES sample surveys were added to the ANSWERS matrix. The cost and time involved in hand-coding each variable were tremendous. However, another taxonomy was already in place from other Data Analysis System (DAS) software which made these same variables available. Multiple attempts were made to crosswalk the ANSWERS and DAS taxonomies. While this worked for some variables, many others had to be recoded. All attempts to automate the process were inadequate, though they represented a valid starting point. The difficulty of modifying taxonomies and building relationships between taxonomies was made clear. This is another reason why great care must be taken to construct categories. Numerous subject matter experts were used during the creation of the ANSWERS taxonomy, due to the help of NPEC Working Group members, and this is essential for ontology.\nIn using national datasets such as IPEDS and the Survey of Earned Doctorates, researchers are reluctant to compromise on the level of detail they desire. For example, in developing a study of faculty supply and demand, the author brought together datasets about students, degrees, faculty, and employees to estimate how many doctoral recipients were interested in entering academe by discipline and how many entry level faculty positions were available to them. Data on retirements, rank mobility, and other factors were also included. Each dataset that contributed to the model had its own level of disciplinary taxonomy. But in building crosswalks between all of the different datasets, it was only possible to rely on either two-digit CASPAR or two-digit CIP Codes. Much meaningful data are lost this way. Only a relatively small number of two-digit U.S. Census occupation codes are provided to document postsecondary faculty employment. This meant that after many hundreds of hours spent learning about and implementing complex disciplinary taxonomies, data could be analyzed at only a superficial and gross level. It was impossible to create the model with comparable disciplinary taxonomies in each dataset.\nSimilarly, the author recently worked with a consulting firm and national association to help them use IPEDS data. The researchers wanted to provide historical trends of IPEDS financial data. The initial data suggested many unpredicted anomalies and outliers. What they researchers did not know was that the data categories themselves had underlying taxonomy issues. These included the changing nature of the data collection, which involved a move from paper to the web; implementation of new forms based on different accounting standards; cutbacks in the NCES budget for IPEDS for a specific year which resulted in decreased collection and editing of some data; and decisions made not to release a certain year of data in final format because it could not pass adjudication requirements. The categories and types of data over time appeared to be comparable. Only a sophisticated user of IPEDS trend data would be aware of these concerns."}, {"section_title": "V. Future Trends", "text": "This is an unprecedented era of what Gandel et al (2004) call \"Information Abundance\" for higher education. This requires new ways of thinking about \"boundless information\" and how institutional repositories can be rebuilt \"from the bottom up.\" Meta-tools for capturing metadata, especially ontologies, are badly needed.\nIn building taxonomies, it is critical that developers not try and reinvent the wheel. They need to understand existing efforts, where they succeed and where they are less useful than expected. Since ontologies are not yet a commodity and since they cost so much to develop, these efforts at KM must be valued. An organizational culture must be prized in which KM is rewarded, especially those hidden and less glitzy projects such as building a taxonomy.\nIn order for taxonomies to be fluid and changing to meet many different sets of needs, developers must incorporate the principles of dynamic classification. Exciting new software such as Convera and Inxight is now available to combine the best of taxonomies and search engines.\nDevelopers need to incorporate concept maps, pattern recognition, Boolean logic, subject matter experts. They need to understand the natural problems which occur in creating and interfacing between ontologies. While the CHESS/NCHEMS taxonomy of data structures is very impressive and the metadata efforts promoted by NLII for IMS are essential and remain at the forefront of current thinking about learning and technology, these are very expensive to develop and maintain. These initiatives need to continue to evolve and require a substantive commitment of resources and vision.\nWhile sometimes deemed too costly, ontology is shown in this chapter to be central to KM strategies in higher education for capturing and utilizing knowledge assets. The case still needs to be made for the return on investment (ROI) of KM for higher education. This is very critical for content management through taxonomies. Work on ontologies must be given the resources and attention it deserves if content management is going to succeed in helping institutions handle the onslaught of information which is overload existing systems and personnel. The loss of critical knowledge assets with employee turnover and retirement must be stemmed through capturing and leveraging knowledge. This is only possible through the use of dynamic classification.\nThe development of ontologies for higher education is still a nascent field. There is much exciting, groundbreaking research to be done. It is important that institutional leaders and policymakers recognize the value that ontology holds for future work in KM and make the necessary investments now. This starts with a shared vision of what ontology offers to higher education and how taxonomies are interwoven throughout administrative information systems and all webbased learning applications."}]
