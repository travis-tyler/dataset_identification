[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "An improved computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system is proposed for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on the fusion of anatomical (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) and functional ( 8 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)) multimodal images, and which helps to address the strong ambiguity or the uncertainty produced in brain images. The merit of this fusion is that it provides anatomical information for the accurate detection of pathological areas characterized in functional imaging by physiological abnormalities. First, quantification of brain tissue volumes is proposed based on a fusion scheme in three successive steps: modeling, fusion and decision. (1) Modeling which consists of three sub-steps: the initialization of the centroids of the tissue clusters by applying the Bias corrected Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm. Then, the optimization of the initial partition is performed by running genetic algorithms. Finally, the creation of white matter (WM), gray matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tissue maps by applying the Possibilistic FCM clustering algorithm. (2) Fusion using a possibilistic operator to merge the maps of the MRI and PET images highlighting redundancies and managing ambiguities. (3) Decision offering more representative anatomo-functional fusion images. Second, a support vector data description (SVDD) classifier is used that must reliably distinguish AD from normal aging and automatically detects outliers. The \"divide and conquer\" strategy is then used, which speeds up the SVDD process and reduces the load and cost of the calculating. The robustness of the tissue quantification process is proven against noise (20% level), partial volume effects and when inhomogeneities of spatial intensity are high. Thus, the superiority of the SVDD classifier over competing conventional systems is also demonstrated with the adoption of the 10-fold cross-validation approach for synthetic datasets (Alzheimer disease neuroimaging (ADNI) and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS)) and real images. The percentage of classification in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under ROC curve was 93.65%, 90.08%, 92.75% and 97.3%; 91.46%, 92%, 91.78% and 96.7%; 85.09%, 86.41%, 84.92% and 94.6% in the case of the ADNI, OASIS and real images respectively."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "According to \"World Alzheimer Report 2018\" [1] globally, there are 50 million patients suffering from dementia, plus a new patient is touched every three seconds with health care that costs 1 trillion US dollars. The \"World Health Organisation\" predicts that by 2050, 152 million people will be affected, and the costs will reach US $2 trillion by 2030. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most dominant pathology present in 60% to 70% of cases of neurodegenerative dementia [1] . According to researchers from the \"Canadian Outcomes Study in Dementia\" [2] , slowing the progression of this disease will contribute significantly to the reduction of its economic and psychosocial costs. This slowdown depends in particular on the implementation of early interventions, which are possible following an early diagnosis of the disease.\nAmong the branches of neuroimaging, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is a powerful tool that provides early diagnosis of disease progression in a cost-effective and unbiased manner with respect to human inconsistencies. Although several works [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] have been done in the last decade by providing CAD systems for accurate diagnosis, however, few medical image processing tools have been developed to analyze the extensive amount of generated data and to assimilate the rather complex structures of the cerebral image. In this context, the collection of various data, resulting from various modalities: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) as well as expert knowledge, becomes moreover more common in clinical departments for the study of Alzheimer's pathology. The exploitation of all these data, performed by the clinician who analyzes and aggregates the data according to his knowledge, generally leads to a more precise, clearer and more reliable diagnosis.\nSo, the main motivation for this work is to model the expert aggregation process using multimodal fusion techniques. This requires appropriate algorithms for getting a precise description of the regions of interest and the brain tissue affected by AD. Our aim is to use the high resolution anatomical information provided by MRI and the low resolution, highly functional information provided by PET to synthesize a high resolution functional image. The main interest of this type of fusion is to exploit the anatomical information for the precise detection of pathological zones characterized in functional imaging by physiological anomalies. Thus, to meet this multimodal fusion criterion, we propose a CAD system for AD early diagnosis based on MRI-PET multimodal fusion, powerful segmentation and classification approaches whose developed generic process is described hereinafter.\nThe study of Xue Hua et al. [10] has shown that AD affects the brain by overwhelming tissue volumes of gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It is therefore important to achieve a precise quantification of the volume of these tissues that would facilitate the correct diagnosis and understanding of this dementia. However, the task of precise segmentation and tissue volumes quantification is quite complex and one of the open problems in image processing. This is due to the fuzzy boundaries between the tissues particularly, GM and WM. Noting also the uncertainty that comes from noise, partial volume effect (PVE) and anatomical variations within \"pure\" tissue compartments and deformation in tissue volume resulting from AD and treatment. The purpose of our segmentation method is to assist the physician by first assigning the voxel fuzzy memberships, representing the possibility that they have to belong to brain tissue, as well as to calculate segmentation based on the fusion of relevant and redundant information of brain images. So, at first, we performed a segmentation based on fuzzy logic, especially on possibilistic theory, which has the potential to overcome the ambiguity and uncertainty of images [11, 12] . The proposed fusion process is divided into three stages: (1) Modeling: Fuzzy tissue maps are first calculated for all anatomical and functional images. (2) The fusion is then performed for all the tissues with a context-based possibilistic fusion operator. (3) Decision: The final segmentation makes it possible to compute the volumetric measurement of brain tissue volumes and create a new synthetic anatomo-functional image.\nIn the modeling phase, a hybrid clustering algorithm is proposed; we adopt the possibilistic Fuzzy C-Means (PFCM) [13] which has a fuzzy and possibilistic membership at a time. Pal et al. [13] has shown that this algorithm can overcome the weakness of the FCM with respect to noise and PVE and also solve the problem of the possibilistic C-Means (PCM) coincident class. This makes it possible to interpret the complex nature of (GM/WM) or (GM/CSF) interfaces in brain images, where a large number of voxels contain a mixture of two or three tissues.\nFor the initialization of the PFCM parameters, we used the bias corrected FCM algorithm (BCFCM) proposed in [14] . In the BCFCM algorithm, the objective function of the FCM is modified to solve the problem of inhomogeneous intensity of brain images. For this reason, we introduce labeling term for voxel in order to influence it by the intensity of the immediate voxel in the neighborhood. This district serves as a regularizer and directs the solution towards homogeneous piece-wise labeling. This is very useful in the case of segmentation of a cerebral image corrupted by noise [14] . We then propose a genetic optimization for the initialization of the centers of clusters. To this end, we use the genetic algorithms (GA) [15] to determine the appropriate cluster centers and the corresponding fuzzy partition matrix. This empirical initialization avoids local minima and allows the clustering process to converge quickly [16] .\nTo achieve good performance, it is important to develop a robust CAD system that can model and correctly recognize a single class and/or solve multiclass problems in the presence of a non-exhaustive representation of the classes in the learning dataset. In the latter case, the system should be able to recognize the classes modeled in the learning set by correctly rejecting the samples belonging to other classes. We address this critical issue by considering classification system consisting of one-class classifiers, specialized in the identification of a given class and the rejection of others present in the scene. Then, in a second step of our CAD system, a classification is made on the basis of a compact discriminative model. We introduce a general framework for using support vector data description (SVDD) Models [17] , which discriminates healthy subjects from subjects with AD.\nThe utility of this one-class that is based on the establishment of a kernel, proves in its effectiveness to detect outliers and its high accuracy. To add to this, the SVDD has proved its robustness in various applications related to different domains [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] , in the case where no prior knowledge on the distribution of the data is available [25] . This is due to its criterion of taking into consideration only those samples that belong to the target class in order to train the underlying data distribution. Therefore, it is powerful in characterizing the class of interest by rejecting the rest of classes. Given that this methodology is based on the notion of kernel, it inherits the associated advantages [25] . To overcome the scale problem of the SVDD, we applied the \"divide-and-conquer\" strategy which allowed reducing the calculation cost.\nFor the experiments, we used anatomical images (MRI) and functional images ( 8 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET), belonging to two synthetic databases: Alzheimer disease neuroimaging (ADNI) and open access Series of imaging studies (OASIS), as well the real images belonging to the Gabriel-Montpied hospital (GMPH) in Clermont ferrand, France. The efficiency of segmentation is evaluated visually by comparing the image of the final segmentation with that of the available ground truth image (images labeled by the expert). In addition, quantitative validity measures are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches for the CAD system: Tanimoto coefficients (TC) and Jaccard Similarity (JS) for segmentation approach and sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), classification accuracy (CA) and area under ROC curve (AUC) for classification approach. In this context, the robustness of the tissue quantification process is proven against noise, PVE and when inhomogeneities of spatial intensity (ISI) are high. Thus, the superiority of the SVDD classifier over competing conventional systems is also demonstrated.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we present a review of some works in the field of neuroimaging related to automated segmentation of brain tissues and CAD systems, with a brief discussion. In Section 3, we summarize the principle of the proposed CAD system using possibilistic-fuzzy-genetic fusion scheme based segmentation and SVDD based classification. The experimental results on simulated and real data are presented in Section 4. Some concluding remarks are drawn in Section 5."}, {"section_title": "Related-Work", "text": "In recent decades, several studies have been proposed in the neuroimaging field, and relating to the AD diagnostic systems. In this context, various machine learning and intelligent technical tools have been successfully developed in the literature."}, {"section_title": "Related-Work to the MR Segmentation of Brain Regions", "text": "In the literature, a variety of works have preferred to use pattern recognition techniques (see [26] for more details), to segment brain images by magnetic resonance. Two types of approaches can be distinguished: supervised and unsupervised. The supervised approach, such as the statistical approach [27, 28] , the k-nearest neighbors [29] [30] [31] and artificial neural networks [32] [33] [34] , needs a crisp label for some images. As a result, the images to be segmented are split into two sets, learning and testing. Therefore, the performance of this approach can be strongly related to the choice of learning set.\nThe unsupervised approach has a high repetition because its results are based in particular on the information of the image data itself. In addition, it almost dispenses with model assumption as well as the distribution of image data. Learning in this case is not necessary to segment the images. The principle consists in grouping the voxels in clusters with physical tissue labels, aiming to separate the characteristics in different clusters by minimizing an objective function [26] . There are two types of sub-approaches: hard and fuzzy clustering. The first aims to determine a crisp partition of a set of vectors in C clusters. Therefore, each voxel receives a unique tissue assignment.\nOn the other hand, a fuzzy clustering with the classic Bezdek FCM algorithm is widely used for MR image segmentation [35] , because of the actual segmentation performance. It assigns a membership degree to each voxel, which indicates the voxel's membership to a region (cluster). Indeed, voxels can be classified into several classes of tissues with a varying degree of belonging. This is one of the main motivations for using fuzzy clustering techniques in this study.\nThe scientific community is moving towards fuzzy logic approaches to model the complexity of medical data and to reinforce the most used algorithm, the FCM against noise and spatial inhomogeneities and PVE artifacts. Some related work is proposed in this section.\nWang et al. [36] , propose the modified FCM algorithm that associates local neighborhood information with nonlocal in the clustering process to expand robustness against noise.\nShen et al. [37] proposed the improved FCM that modifies the voxel distance from class center, adding a neighborhood attraction, taking the intensity and distance criteria into consideration.\nSzil\u00e1gyi et al. [38] proposed the enhanced FCM algorithm, which integrates a mean filter on the input image whose result is an average image. A linearly weighted sum is then calculated between the original image and the average image.\nZhang and Chen [39] proposed the spatially constrained kernelized FCM algorithm that modifies the objective function of the FCM by integrating on the one hand, a distance based kernel-induced spatial constraint, and on the other hand, by incorporating a penalty term that contains spatial neighborhood information.\nChuang et al. [40] propose the FCMSI algorithm, which integrates into the membership value of each voxel, the sum of belongings to its neighborhoods. A control parameter that checks the trade-off between the original filtered images is usually estimated by trial and error experiments.\nCai et al. [41] proposed the fast generalized FCM algorithm which exploits the local spatial and gray level relationships to specify a locality parameter that overrides the global parameter.\nKaran Sikka et al. [42] , propose the following process: a homomorphic filter based on entropy is used to correct the inhomogeneity. Then, a local peak merge method is proposed to initialize the centers of classes. The image voxels is finally grouped using a modified FCM which takes into account the neighborhood information.\nHowever, despite FCM and its variants being very useful classification methods, they cannot effectively compensate for intensity inhomogeneities and may be inaccurate in a noisy environment [43] . All these methods that modify the objective function lead to computational problems due to the modification of most equations as well as the objective function. In addition, degrees of membership do not always match those of the data. In FCM and its extensions, the generated membership values represent the degree of sharing, but not the degree of typicality or compatibility with elastic constraint. Typicality here means the degree to which a voxel belongs to a cluster rather than an arbitrary division of data.\nIn the Krishnapuram and Keller [43] algorithm, the PCM is more robust to noise and PVE and approached this problem by associating absolute membership values t ij of the characteristics to clusters that represent the degree of typicality rather than the degree of sharing and hence the elimination of the FCM constraint ( C i=1 u ij = 1, j \u2208 {1, . . . , C}) is performed. Thus, each cluster is independent of other clusters in PCM. In this context, the PCM membership t ij of a voxel vector x j to tissue class i only depends on the distance d(x j , b i ) between x j and class center b i , and not on the memberships of x j in all other classes, as is the case for FCM of which the analytic formulation of the membership degree u ij depends on the distances of x j to all class centers b k . This is very convenient in the case of strong ambiguity or uncertainty, which can occur in brain images.\nHowever, as pointed out by Barni et al. [44] , PCM is highly dependent on the initialization and it sometimes generates coincident clusters. Furthermore, typicalities can be very sensitive to the choice of the additional parameters such as estimation of scale parameter \u03b7 i , which determines the distance at which the membership value of a voxel in a tissue cluster becomes 0.5.\nIn addition, increasing the possible number of local minima can produce a number of bad minimizers likely to lock the PCM iterations into weak classification. The computational time required for PCM is O(n). It should be noted that PCM can generate trivial solutions since the solution spaces are not constant over all clusters; moreover, it only achieves a local minimum and so is unable to minimize the objective function in a global sense.\nThe performance of PCM for noisy data can be improved using the possibilistic-fuzzy c-means (PFCM) clustering algorithm proposed by Pal and Bezdek, in [13] . It is a hybridization of PCM and FCM which solves the noise sensitivity defect of FCM and overcomes the coincident clusters problem of PCM. This is our motivation to choose, PFCM for the assessment of WM, GM and CSF volumes in the context of fusion scheme based tissue quantification."}, {"section_title": "Related Work to Computer Aided-Diagnosis System of Alzheimer's Disease", "text": "Given the clinical accessibility of MRI clinically for neuroimaging, several studies have attempted to use images from synthetic bases such as ADNI and OASIS to exploit this anatomical modality or to associate it with various modalities using multimodal fusion techniques to improve the performance of CAD systems for AD.\nIn [45] , Huang and Lee improved the performance of the maximization mutual information (MMI) approach by providing FCM/MMI fusion for MR and SPECT multimodal images to generate the fuzzy map of brain tissue.

Two classifiers, the support vector machines (SVM) and the feed-forward neural network (FFNN) were used with PET images from the ADNI database. The results were based on classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and AUC (area under the ROC curve). The SVM outperformed the FFNN with better results.\nIn [48] , the scale-invariant feature transforms (SIFT) approach is used for parameter extraction of MRI images from the OASIS database. A selection strategy was then used based on the application of Fisher's discrimination report and GA. SVMs with different kernels were finally applied with \"leave-one-out\" cross-validation.\nIn [49] , Bhavana and Krishnappa improved the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) approach by proposing the intensity hue saturation (HIS) approach to merge PET and MRI ADNI images. The authors validated the results with four performance measures: mean squared error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), average gradient (AG), and spectral discrepancy (SD) and with best visual observation.\nIn [50] , MKL method that combines the MRI, FDG-PET and CSF modalities are proposed to measure brain atrophy and to quantify hypo metabolism and proteins related to AD.

A multi-kernel SVM is then applied for classification. The published results using classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and AUC demonstrate good results.\nIn [54] , multilevel convolutional neural networks (CNN) is proposed to train and combine the parameters of MRI and PET multimodal images from the ADNI database. Good performance is achieved in term of classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and AUC.\nIn [6] , a very deep convolution network is proposed, applying it on MRI images from the OASIS database. The performance of the approach is demonstrated in terms of classification accuracy with five-fold cross validation.\nIn a previous work [5] , a hybrid FCM/ PCM segmentation process is proposed to evaluate the tissue volume of MR and PET images with 20% noise level from ADNI database.

In contrast, research is still centered on a clinical core of early and important episodic memory disorders. In addition, the majority of systems apply for image registration purposes with the objective of helping physicians to locate the same region of interest on multiple images of the same patient. However, beyond the registration stage, many things remain to be done! The multimodal fusion idea that allows combining several images from different types of modalities, for the purpose of constructing a fusion image, is an interesting concept that opens several perspectives. Such a process could ideally suspend any unnecessary information found in the images taken separately. It thus allows combining the relevant data so that the new merged image is legible and easier for the physician to appreciate. In this fusion image, the physician could even visualize information that was not clear in both images.

For this purpose, the BFCM algorithm is applied in several attempts to generate these chromosomes in order to obtain an initial population. By executing GA operators (crossover and mutation), this population is used to create new populations in order to achieve a better one (offspring). The chromosomes are chosen according to their fitness, the more appropriate they are, the more chances they are to be exploited for reproduction.

Principle of Possibilistic fuzzy c-means algorithm: The advantage of the PFCM clustering [13] is that it generates the two membership functions simultaneously of the PCM and FCM algorithms. The first function represents the possibilistic membership (t ij ) of the absolute degrees of typicality, and the second characterizes the fuzzy membership (u ij ) of the relative degrees. This mixed algorithm makes it possible to associate with each feature vector of the voxel x i , t ij and u ij in each of the C clusters, reflecting the degree of belonging of the voxel x i , to cluster j. Iterative optimization is applied to approach the minima of a PFCM constrained objective function:\nwhere u ij are constrained by the probabilistic conditions, while t ij \u2208 [0,1] are subject to: The variables (\u03b3 i > 0, i = 1, . . . , C) are user defined constants, which represent the possibilistic penalty terms and control the variance of the clusters. The fuzzy exponent m and possibilistic exponent \u03b7 must be greater than 1, while a (a > 0) and b (b > 0) are tradeoff parameters to set the balance between the probabilistic and possibilistic term. The parameters a and b define the relative importance of membership and typicality in the computation of centroids.\nUnlike most fuzzy and possibilistic clustering algorithms, PFCM produces three outputs: fuzzy partition or membership matrix U, possibility matrix T of typicalities and a set B of C prototypes b i that compactly represents the clusters.

The ground truth was available and the expert labeling of the tissue regions was known. The reference images of the three datasets are accompanied by volumetric segmentation files produced through Freesurfer processing. For GMPH images the manual segmentation was performed by one qualified expert from the hospital of Gabriel-Montpied, whereas one could refer to the following references [61] [62] [63] for more details on the complete list of researchers and experts for ADNI and OASIS.\nThe quantitative evaluation is desirable for objective comparison because it is difficult to determine visually the difference between the results of the proposed approaches. The comparison with the result of atlas-based segmentation is done based on two segmentation metrics, namely TC, and JS which allow validating the performance of the segmentation approach.\nTC was defined for a given tissue as the number of voxels affected simultaneously to the same tissue in both computed and ground truth images divided by the number of voxels assigned to the tissue in the two labeled images.\nThe TC index is close to 1 for very similar results and is near 0 when the labeled images share no similarly classified voxels. It is described as follows [58] :\nwhere v T AR is the number of voxels that are assigned to tissue T in automated labeled image (calculated by PFCM segmentation algorithm) and the reference labeled image (ground truth), v T A and v T R denote the number of voxels assigned to tissue T by the automated algorithm and ground truth respectively.\nJS metric is used to evaluate the spatial overlap between the ground truth (G) and segmented (S) tissues. It is computed as the ratio between the intersection and union of the S and G tissues as follows:\nThe JS values are between 0 and 1, greater values indicate that more voxels of the segmented tissue correspond to that of the ground truth image.\nThe performance of the proposed PFCM modeling with hybrid BCFCM/GA initialization has been compared with some other clustering approaches viz., (1) FCM modeling with random initialization. In all performed experiments and for all simulated and real images, we noticed that modeling performance with BCFCM initialization outperformed that with FCM initialization. Noting further that the hybrid BCFCM/GA model produced the best results, convergence was fast with good compensation for noise. This is due to the regularization term integrated into the BCFCM algorithm and the benefit of optimization with GA.\nIn general, PFCM modeling with hybrid BCFCM/GA initialization was more accurate in providing the highest TC values compared to the results of other competing methods. However, we found that for near-low noise levels (from 1% to 5%), the performance of tissue segmentation was almost the same for all approaches. However, by increasing the noise level for values in the range [6%-20%], the results of the PFCM modeling with hybrid initialization BCFCM/GA are richly performing with higher quality of tissue volumes, with respect to the spatial inhomogeneities. The performance of the voxel classification was reduced by gradually increasing the noise level from 6% to 20%. Specifically, voxels that should be classified to GM tissue were falsely classified to WM and CSF tissues. While CSF voxels were falsely classified to GM and WM tissues.\nThe possible explanation for the success of the proposed BCFCM/GA/PFCM hybrid clustering scheme and for the good obtained results is that the FCM, PCM and FPCM approaches were more susceptible to the effect of noise, particularly FCM. In the result figures, this finding is clearly visible, where the FCM was unstable and sensitive to noise. The PCM gave balanced results, but the performance was insufficient. In contrast, hybrid models of fuzzy possibilistic clustering, FPCM and PFCM were stable and robust to noise with better performance, however, the PFCM was more efficient because, from 6% of noise, volumes became more difficult to segment, because of the accentuated noise and the spatial inhomogeneities that they contain. This requires a robust approach which adapts to the high noise level.\nBrain Sci. 2019, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW  18 of 35 The Figures 8-10 report TC measure based segmentation results for some images of datasets, by varying the additive noise level from 1% to 20%. To ensure the performance of the proposed modeling approach, 20 experiments were performed with different random trials to obtain the BCFCM/GA initial partitions where the voxels were subjected to a noise level of 20%. For some images of ADNI, OASIS and GMPH dataset, Figures 11 and 12 represent these TC and JS results obtained with the proposed modelling approach (BCFCM/GA/PFCM) (case C in the figures). The results of the two main PCM and FPCM clustering methods with a genetic BCFCM initialization (A and B in the figures) are reported for comparison purposes. These figures show the descriptive statistics of the data and the corresponding boxplots which allow giving the displaying of the distribution of data based on five-number summary the minimum, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and maximum calculating the mean and the standard deviation (Sdev).\nFor all experiences and images, the same deductions were noticed. First, we can determine that PFCM's median is higher (values in range [0.72,0.85]) than FPCM's which is higher than PCM's median. The PFCM has a small Sdev and in the majority of the experiences, the PFCM observations are split evenly at the median with a symmetric distribution, unlike for FPCM and PCM where the distribution of the measured data is skewed at the top or bottom.\nThe interquartile range (IQR = Q3 \u2212 Q1) for the proposed approach (C) is smaller in comparison with the FPCM and PCM approaches, but IQR-FPCM is smaller than IQR-PCM. This indicates that the TC and JS data for all experiences are more condensed (closer together). In order sense, the larger the IQR, the more variable the data set is (in the case of PCM, meaning the data are more spread out).\nMany suspected outliers were detected with the PCM, less in the case of FPCM and none with PFCM for all experiments (with the exception of a single outlier which was identified in experiment 3 for TC data and 17 for JS).

Comparison with SVM classifier, based on BCFCM/GA/PFCM (case B). Table 3 provides the results of the quantitative analysis based on the AC, SE, SP and AUC measurements of the proposed CAD system, including the results of several competing systems namely [5, 46, 47, 54] for ADNI and [48] for OASIS. The proposed multimodal system provided the best results compared to those obtained by competing systems. The percentage of classification in terms of (AC, SE, SP, AUC) (%) was (85.09%, 86.14%, 84.92%, 94%) for GMPH dataset. In the case of the ADNI base, the result was (93.65%, 90.08%, 92.75%, 97.3%) for 159 multimodal MRI/PET images, compared with [5] which obtained (75%, 84.67%, 81.58%) using 95 MRI and (73%, 86.36%, 82.67%) using 95 PET images. Better results than those of [54] which acquired (89.64%, 87.10%, 92%, 94.45%) for 193 multimodal MRI/PET images. It was more efficient than the [46] system which achieved (81%, 78.52%, 81.76%) for 159 multimodal MRI/PET images. Added to this is the CAD system of [47] , which got an accuracy rate of 89.52% using 105 PET images. For the OASIS database, the proposed multimodal system obtained (91.46%, 92%, 91.78%, 96.7%) with an equal error rate (EER) of 0.64% which is lower than the EER (0.72%) obtained in the work of [48] using the same conditions with 198 OASIS MR images.\nIn addition, the proposed multimodal system was more efficient than its similar one using a single modality (MRI or PET). The results in the table highlight the advantages of multimodal fusion of brain images based on the one hand, on hybrid possibilistic-fuzzy-genetic segmentation and on the other hand, on the SVDD classifier, to clearly improve the performance of the classification system. In fact, all the values of the quantitative measurements obtained with the fusion of anatomical and functional images were superior to those of other competing CAD systems. In general, the best results were achieved when the fusion was based on the FOP 4 fusion operator.\nWith regard to computing time, the proposed CAD system with the use of the \"divide and conquer\" strategy converged more quickly. It consumed only 45 min for OASIS, 30 min for ADNI and 5 min for GMPH compared to its analogue without the application of this strategy and which consumed 2 h, 1 h, 45 min and 30 min for OASIS, ADNI and GMPH respectively. "}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Perspective", "text": "In this paper, a CAD system has been proposed to diagnose patients with probable prognosis for AD. It was mainly based on two modules. First, a segmentation module that takes into consideration noise, associated PVE, inhomogeneity of intensity, and weak boundaries that limit the diagnostic potential of the MRI and PET brain images. In this context, a multimodal fusion process was proposed based on the fuzzy-genetic-possibilistic foundations to model uncertain and inaccurate data in medical images. It is composed of three stages, modeling, fusion and decision. We first derive fuzzy tissue maps by modeling the degree of relationship between a voxel and a given tissue. These maps are then combined into fused maps using a possibilistic conjunctive operator highlighting redundancies in fuzzy maps and managing ambiguous areas but relevant for diagnosis. The interest of the fusion is then demonstrated by a labeling process and by the synthesis of a new high resolution functional image which exploits the anatomical information for the precise detection of pathological zones.\nWe first adopt BCFCM to determine the initial partition of tissue classes. Afterwards, the problem of fuzzy clustering was posed as an optimization problem, applying the GA to obtain the most optimal initial partition. Then, a modeling based on the PFCM is carried out in order to model the degree of relationship between each tissue class and a given voxel. This hybrid possibilistic-fuzzy algorithm overcomes some weaknesses of its analogues, namely FCM, PCM and FPCM. It solves the FCM noise sensitivity deficit problem, overcomes the problem of coincident PCM clusters, and provides an improvement to the FPCM by eliminating the sum constraints of the FPCM lines.\nWe then propose as a second module, an automatic learning approach based on the one-class SVDD discriminative classifier, which allows distinguishing between the brain images belonging to patients with AD and those of patients in normal aging. The advantage of such a classifier is its robustness against outlier points. All the obtained experimental results show that this kind of classifier represents a promising approach in the presence of incomplete and imprecise training knowledge, allowing a flexible adaptation of the classification architecture to the available information.\nThe performance of the proposed CAD system has been validated on several sets of synthetic and real brain images. For the proposed tissue quantification approach, results of some slices chosen because of their tissue particularities, are given. In general, the hybrid fuzzy-genetic-possibilistic fusion process allowed segmentation of acceptable quality and superior performance to some state-of-the-art methods for a 20% noise level.\nTo ensure the superiority of the CAD system based on the SVDD classifier, a comparison has been made with other proposed systems. The higher classification percentage in the case of the proposed system compared to the performance of other proposed classifiers in the literature, demonstrates the interest of the SVDD classifier and the superior capabilities of the multimodal fusion approach in comparison to the consideration of a single modality in the segmentation of cerebral images.\nThe results of the CAD system obtained for patients suffering from AD were encouraging; however, many perspectives are expected for this prospective study. The application of approaches for T1-weighted anatomical images could be remedied using T2 weighting, proton density and other types of MRI images. It is also desirable to look for other larger databases that have noisy brain images and approximate to actual clinical images. It is also interesting to adapt the proposed approaches to detect other brain disorders such as Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, etc.\nOur current concern was to provide for the expert radiologist labeling images and a functional synthesis image which exploits the anatomical information for the precise detection of pathological zones. According to some studies, the hippocampus is probably the first of these pathological brain areas affected by the pathogenic mechanisms of AD. Our study touches on some of these aspects but unfortunately, the distribution of hippocampal cell loss in normal aging and in AD is not well understood at this time. In this context, an extended study will be developed in the near future.\nFurther work is needed to improve the quality of the CAD system. As a result, as a perspective of this work, other more robust hybrid algorithms will be desired for segmentation, and other classifier models with explanatory reasoning will be desired to model the complex and incomplete data."}]
