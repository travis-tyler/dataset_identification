HSCs are a group of unique cells: Not only do they have the ability to self-renew like other somatic cells, but they also possess the ability to differentiate into progenitor cells, and eventually into mature blood cells of various cell lineages (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . In previous studies (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) , HSCs from C57BL/6 (B6)-based mouse strains showed no signs of senescence, whereas HSCs from other strains showed decreased functionality with increasing age. These strain differences were the groundwork for genetic analyses that defined several quantitative trait loci that regulate HSC senescence (4, 8, 9) . HSC functional ability is usually studied in cell mixtures because of low HSC frequency and unpredictable associations between HSC phenotype and function (10) (11) (12) (13) . Thus, a significant decrease in HSC functionality with increasing age is a practical definition for HSC senescence.\nAn important pair of cytokine-receptor signaling molecules in the regulation of HSC function and senescence are stem cell factor (SCF) and its receptor, c-Kit (CD117), a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase expressed on primitive HSCs and progenitor cells (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . Expression of CD117 has been used as a marker to characterize HSCs in mice and in humans (15, 16, (19) (20) (21) . SCF and c-Kit interaction triggers a chain of signaling events which activate downstream pathways leading to cell proliferation and/or differentiation (14, 22) . Spontaneous mutations in mice of the c-Kit gene result in the characteristic white spotting with serious consequences, including functional failure in hematopoiesis (17, 18, (23) (24) (25) . Thus, c-Kit signaling plays a significant role in maintaining normal hematopoiesis.\nIn the current study, we specifically tested the effects of aging on c-Kit expression and c-Kit signaling in bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic cells. First, we found that the proportion and total number of c-Kit \u00fe cells are significantly increased in aged B6D2F1 mice in various BM cell fractions. We then sorted BM cells into Lin"}, {"section_title": "CD117", "text": "\u00c0 fractions and cultured them in vitro to test cell expansion with or without SCF stimulation. Our data support the view that HSCs from B6D2F1 mice have very high proliferative potentials and do not reach proliferative arrest even at an old age during a normal life span. Increasing age is associated with an enlarged HSC pool and an enhanced HSC response to SCF stimulation in B6D2F1 mice.\n\u00fe cells cultured with SCF ( Figure 4C ). Without SCF, old Lin\n\u00fe cells expanded 2.33 6 0.79-fold, slightly more (not significant) than the 1.52 6 0.61-fold expansion of young cells ( Figure 4C) .\nWe further analyzed cultured cells by flow cytometry for the expression of CD117 and Sca1 on Lin \u00c0 cells ( Figure 5 ). Essentially, there was no CD117 or Sca1 expression on Lin \u00c0 cells from cultured young ( Figure 5A ) and old ( Figure 5B ) total BM cells. This was also the case in Lin \u00c0 cells from cultured young ( Figure 5C ) and old ( Figure 5D ) Lin\ncells from young ( Figure 5E ) and old ( Figure 5F ) mice contained larger cell fractions expressing both CD117 and Sca1. However, the proportions of CD117\n\u00fe cells were much larger in cultured cells from old B6D2F1 mice ( Figure 5F ). \n\u00c0 cells (C) from young and old B6D2F1 mice were each cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium at 378C with 5% CO 2 with or without the presence of stem cell factor at 25 ng/mL. Three days later, cells were harvested and counted under a regular light microscope. Fold of cell expansion was calculated based on the number of cells harvested and the number of cells used to initiate the culture. Data are presented as means with standard error bars from triplicate measurements. \n\u00c0 cells (C and D), and sorted Lin\n\u00fe cells (E and F) from young (A, C, and E) and old (B, D, and F) B6D2F1 mice were shown as dot plots after 3 days culture in Dulbecco's modified essential medium at 378C with 5% CO 2 and stem cell factor at 25 ng/mL. Cells from triplicate culture wells of each sample were pooled for the staining.\n\u00fe cell fraction contains primitive HSCs, whereas the Lin \u00c0\n\u00c0 cell fraction does not. In the case of HSC senescence, Morrison and colleagues (28) found that old B6 mice had a 5-to 7-fold increase in cells with the HSC marker phenotype and a 2-fold increase in HSC engraftment in vivo. Results from our current study are consistent with these findings from earlier studies that the HSC-containing Lin\n\u00fe cells are highly responsive to SCF stimulation ( Figure 4B) .\nAs a key receptor, c-Kit plays a vital role in the regulation of HSC proliferation and differentiation. This protooncogene lies on mouse chromosome 5 at the Whitespotting locus. Mutations at the White-spotting locus affect proliferation and/or migration of cells during early embryogenesis and cause intrinsic defects in the HSC hierarchy (17, 29) . Mutations at different portions of the c-Kit gene result in various levels of functional loss, affecting embryonic survival and hematopoiesis (14, 18, 23, 24) . In our current study, increasing age caused significant increases in the proportion and total number of CD117 \u00fe cells in various cell fractions, especially the Lin\n\u00fe primitive HSCs (Figures 1 and 3) . Our result is consistent with observations in B6 mice, where increasing age is associated with an increased number and function of HSCs (4, 9, 28, 30) .\nTwo elements are to be considered in studying HSC senescence: HSC number and functional ability per HSC. In BALB mice, HSC frequency was unchanged and total HSCs per mouse was slightly higher in old mice as a result of the increased total BM cellularity. However, functional ability per HSC was significantly reduced in old BALB mice and accounted for the overall decline in HSC functionality (3, 4) . In the current study, sorted Lin \u00fe cells recover much faster than do animals transplanted with the same number of B6 cells. Data from early studies using B6-based strains showed that marrow or spleen grafts from aged mice produced antibody-forming cells as effectively as did grafts from younger donors in recipients. In addition, grafts from aged and younger donors gave similar responses when stimulated with various doses of antigens (6, 7) . Marrow cell lines from old donors also functioned as well as those from young donors after transplantation into either W/W v anemic or lethally-irradiated normal recipients (7). In the B6-D2 allophenic mice, D2 HSCs showed high functionality early in life, but were then eclipsed by HSCs of the B6 genotype (34) . When B6-D2 allophenic marrow cells were engrafted into lethally irradiated B6D2F1 recipients, D2 hematopoiesis was dominant early after transplantation but B6 hematopoiesis ascended over the subsequent months to become dominant later in life (35, 36) . Our data, which show a higher response of old Lin In a recent report, Chen and colleagues (37) found that freshly isolated CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe T cells from aged B6 mice expressed increased levels of chemokines such as interferonc-inducible protein 10 and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1a and -1b, and that the age-related difference in T-cell chemokine expression has an important functional consequence. In studying in vitro proliferative potential of human skin biopsies from members of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, Smith and colleagues (38) found a significant decline in proliferative potential with donor age in females, but not in males. In addition, the proliferative potential was significantly greater for donors under the age of 30 years when compared with all donors over the age of 30 years (38) . We speculate that HSCs from B6D2F1 and other B6-based strains may have higher proliferative potentials or lower proliferative rates. This might also be the case for the skin biopsies from some of the older men in the study by Smith and colleagues (38) . The larger HSC pool in old B6D2F1 mice is associated with insignificantly lower mature cell counts in the peripheral blood. It is possible that the enlarged HSC pool in old B6D2F1 mice is a response to the aged environment, in which up-regulation in HSC proliferation is necessary to maintain hematopoiesis at a normal level.\nWe studied the effect of aging on HSC number and functional response to SCF stimulation in vitro in B6D2F1 mice.\nIncreasing age is associated with a significant increase in the total number of HSCs and progenitor cells. Sorted HSCs from old B6D2F1 mice also showed significantly higher levels of response to SCF stimulation in vitro. Thus, not only the HSC pool size, but also the functional ability per HSC, are increased in aged B6D2F1 mice during a normal life span."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Mice and Cell Preparation", "text": "Hybrid B6D2F1 mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and were housed in the National Institutes of Health animal facility under standard care and nutrition conditions.
