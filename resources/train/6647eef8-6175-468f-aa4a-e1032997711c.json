[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The 2005 hurricane season was particularly damaging to the United States, contributing to significant losses to energy infrastructure -much of it a result of flooding from storm surges during hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Previous research suggests that these events are not isolated, but rather foreshadow a risk that is to continue and likely increase with a changing climate (17). Since extensive energy infrastructure exists along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf coasts, these facilities are exposed to an increasing risk of flooding. We study the combined impacts of anticipated sea level rise, hurricane activity, and subsidence on energy infrastructure in these regions with a first application to Galveston Bay. Using future climate conditions as projected by four different Global Circulation Models (GCMs), we model the change in hurricane activity from present day climate conditions in response to a climate projected in 2100 under the IPCC A l B emissions scenario using hurricane analysis developed by Emanuel (5). We apply the results from hurricane runs from each model to the SLOSH model (Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes) (19) to investigate the change in frequency and distribution of surge heights across climates. Further, we incorporate uncertainty surrounding the magnitude of sea level rise and subsidence, resulting in more detailed projections of risk levels for energy infrastructure over the next century. With a detailed understanding of energy facilities' changing risk exposure, we conclude with a dynamic programming cost-benefit analysis to optimize decision making over time as it pertains to adaptation. from these storms raises the question: Are these isolated events or are hurricanes becoming more destructive in a changing climate? This work aims to answer that question. More specifically, we focus on the damage that coastal energy infrastructure is exposed to under climate change. Further, we expand from these risk exposures to capture the expected benefit and optimal timeframe for adaptation. For coastal infrastructure at risk of flooding, adaptation involves protective levees built to retain ocean water. The cost of constructing and maintaining the levees is weighed against the expected damage costs of postponing precautionary adaptation measures. We present a time-dependent dynamic decision making process built to minimize the expected costs."}, {"section_title": "Climate Change", "text": "Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have lead to an increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, for instance, has increased by 3 1 % since preindustrial times (13). The presence of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere traps outgoing radiation. Without these gases, Earth would be inhabitable; however, an increased concentration of greenhouse gases over the past century has resulted in an increase in global temperatures and thus a changing climate. As anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase in concentration, we expect to see global average temperatures increase further. The rate of this increase is largely dependent on the rate of emissions as well as the feedback loops that occur (28). This past century, global average temperatures have risen by 0.8'C with about 0.6'C of that increase occurring since 1980 (23). The IPCC AR4 report predicts this trend of temperature increases to continue and to be another 0.3 to 6.4 'C higher by the year 2100 (28). This increase in temperature that we have seen over the past three decades has had a variety of effects on our global environmental system. Increases in atmospheric water vapor, increases in ocean temperatures, decreases in glacial snow cover and arctic sea ice, and changes in precipitation are among many of the changes that have been recorded over the past several decades (2). Most relevant to this project are the changes in tropical storm activity and sea level rise, which also happen to be the two areas of climate science with some of the greatest uncertainty. While a geographic location may see a wide range of storms every year, damage to infrastructure is generally all accounted for during the rare severe storms. Recently, studies have shown that 10% of storms cause 90% of damage, and I% of storms cause 58% of damage globally. Under climate change, the intensity of severe storms is anticipated to increase with estimates suggesting 10% of storms will cause 93% of damage and I % of storms will cause 64% of damages (3 1). Speculation about an increase in intensity of extreme storm events is based on the understanding that with an increase in sea surface temperature (SST), tropical storms will have more potential to grow in intensity and develop to be more destructive (18). Increased temperatures have also affected ocean levels and are anticipated to affect them further in the future. Cazenave and Llovel estimate that the mean sea level has risen about 17cm since 1900 as a result of increased global temperatures (3). Global temperatures affect ocean levels in two distinct ways. One is through thermal expansion: As ocean temperatures increase, water expands, taking up more space and increasing sea level. The second is through a decrease in land-ice cover leading to more water running off into the oceans. Scientists have a fairly good idea of the temperature effects on thermal expansion, temperature impacts on the melting rate of the great ice sheets is a less understood relationship. Understanding the physical processes that lead to the observed trends in sea level rise and hurricane frequency and intensity helps us to predict a future climate scenario."}, {"section_title": "Energy Facilities at Risk", "text": "The United States, as the third largest oil producer in the world, second largest producer of natural gas, and second largest producer of coal, necessarily has a large amount of energy infrastructure. With a changing climate, infrastructure is exposed to more extremes, most destructive being extreme wind and water damage. While wind has destructive potential for power lines and window damage, large scale energy infrastructure is most vulnerable to damage resulting from floods. This reduces the scope of facilities at risk under consideration here to those at risk of flooding. To further reduce our scope, we focus our analysis specifically on coastal flooding. In the United States, coastal energy infrastructure is largely a mix of oil refineries, oil import sites, and natural gas hubs (29). Much of this infrastructure is on the Atlantic Coast and Gulf Coast of the U.S., with the Gulf Coast being more densely populated with these facilities. The Eastern side of the U.S. also happens to be exposed to North Atlantic Tropical Cyclones. As an example of the facilities at risk, Figure   I-1 shows the distribution of electric generation in the U.S..

A hurricane is defined as 'an intense tropical weather system of strong thunderstorms with a well-defined surface circulation and maximum sustained winds of 74 mph or higher' (1). Hurricanes are on average 300 miles wide, and they generally survive for 2 weeks. In order to form, hurricanes require pre-existing weather disturbances, atmospheric moisture, warm ocean water (80\"F or higher), and light prevailing winds. Typically, under these conditions, a cluster of thunderstorms grows in the middle of the Atlantic, continually feeding off the warmth of the ocean water and the heat that is produced as water vapor condenses into drops. Strong prevailing winds can often tear these tropical depressions apart; however, with light prevailing winds the tropical depression will move and, with the Coriolis effect, begin the counterclockwise rotation and take on the typical spiral formation. At this point, what was originally a tropical depression has reached the classification of a tropical storm. If the storm continues to grow and become strong enough (winds 74 mph or higher), the storm is classified as a hurricane. If, however, the storm passes over cooler bodies of water or over land, it will lose energy and die off.  where V\" is the maximum wind speed and the interval is over the lifetime of the storm.  (1). They are formed by the external forcing of an approaching storm and are known to cause the most damage and deaths during a hurricane. The intensity of a storm is not the only factor governing the magnitude of the storm surge, as discussed below. We can study how these features influence the magnitude of storm surge using simplified models of the region. The SLOSH model (11), run by the National Hurricane Center, is a hydrodynamic model that applies hurricane simulations with a numerical grid of a coastal region to simulate the resulting storm surge. ADCIRC is a three dimensional finite volume coastal ocean model and is used to model the hydrodynamics around shelves (20). It has a higher resolution than SLOSH and so is computationally more expensive but, integrated vertically it can be used to validate SLOSH results. Due to limited time, we were unable to use ADCIRC for validation in this analysis."}, {"section_title": "Tides", "text": "When a storm makes landfall, the tidal period has an impact on the resulting surge height. Including tides in our assessment adds complications to our analysis. First, a changing sea level has the potential to change the tides in the region as it affects the resonance structure of the tidal systems. The coastal structure, latitude, and bathymetry all add to unique tidal patterns, thus the changes in tides will vary with each location as well. Tides have a nonlinear impact on storm surges, the tidal-surge interaction itself being influenced by shelf geometry. For shallow or more pronounced slopes in ocean floors, the nonlinear impacts of tides on surge heights is more pronounced. Nonlinearity is further pronounced for storm arrivals making landfall at low tide (26). has been attributed to the removal of ground water, and some, especially in the Gulf has been a result of the mining of natural gas or oil. As water or these large deposits of fuels are mined from deep wells, the integrity of the support structure is weakened and the land above has the potential to sink or collapse into the newly emptied geological structures. Infrastructure will inevitably be sinking closer to sea level in locations experiencing subsidence, and thus becoming more vulnerable to coastal flooding."}, {"section_title": "Subsidence", "text": "\nWe approach this portion of our analysis, again, with wide uncertainty. The rate of subsidence will depend on a few factors, namely what we draw from the ground (water, natural gas, oil). So the rate at which subsidence occurs can be altered as changes in policy and human activity occur. There is also possibility of technology advancement that could slow down subsidence. Given these unknown factors, predicting the rate of subsidence is a challenge. We run our analysis off of a distribution based roughly on the previous century's subsidence levels. The locations of our interest sit in a zone that has seen roughly between 3 and 4 feet of subsidence between 1906 and 2000. To estimate this coming century's subsidence, we use a triangular distribution. We assume that there will likely be a slower rate of subsidence given an increased understanding of the causes. We therefore assume a mean of 2 feet and use 4 feet as our upper bound. We use zero for our lower bound and construct a triangular distribution on these three parameters. (see Figure 3-11) With clearer policies and with appropriate models, we would derive a more realistic distribution. We use a triangular distribution to bring attention to the lack of understanding behind the extent and risks of subsidence. "}, {"section_title": "Sea Level Rise", "text": "'Three million years ago, during the Pliocene, the average climate was about 20 to 3 0 C warmer and sea level was 25 to 35 m higher than today's values.'(25) The rate at which ocean levels respond to a 2' to 3 0 C global warming, however, is still unclear. The IPCC AR4 cites that 80% of the heat added to the climate since 1961 has been absorbed by the oceans (28). In fact, ocean temperature increases have been recorded as deep as 3000m. This increase in temperature has lead to thermal expansion, contributing to the sea level rise seen thus far since 1900 (3).  and Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) also play a key role in contributing to sea level rise, although the rate and the extent of their impacts is far less understood. The uncertainty from these components has led to a wide range of sea level rise estimates. The estimates used to develop this analysis fall in the range 0.55m and 2m sea level rise by 2100. Another complication in studying sea level changes is that the changes are not uniform across the globe. Some places on Earth are anticipated to see a greater increase in sea level than others. This is a result of a number of factors. For one, as glaciers and ice sheets melt, the water contributed to the surrounding ocean is colder than the existing water. An influx of cooler water would therefore diminish the impacts of thermal expansion. Some models predict that the sea level change would not change immediately surrounding the ice sheets but that their contribution to a rising sea level would be felt closer to the equator (21). Also, as glaciers melt the pressure that was once on the land underneath is weakened, therefore, we see land masses rising in some locations as it rebounds from the lack of pressure. This is a slow process that takes centuries to reach equilibrium but is yet another contributing factor to an uneven sea level rise. In fact, some regions, such as the Baltics, have seen a decrease in sea level as a result of this phenomenon. Further factors influencing local changes in sea level include surface winds, ocean currents, variations in salinity, and changes in the Earths gravity field (as land ice melts, weight is redistributed across the globe, weakening the local gravitation impacts on water height). 14The wide range of estimates described here, and the complexity of sea level distribution, make it difficult to predict a future sea level with any confidence. We anticipate this component of climate change science to evolve rapidly in the coming years.\nWe model the addition of sea level using two analytical components. There is s stronger scientific basis for estimating sea level rise resulting from thermal expansion. This is one component of our analysis. The great ice sheets are still lacking sound scientific evidence and reasoning for how they will melt. We isolate this component from thermal expansion so that it can be easily modified as the science evolves."}, {"section_title": "Coastal Flood Risk Analysis", "text": "In the work that follows, we combine these contributing factors to risk of inundation in a case study to derive a probability distribution of the risk of flooding over the course of this century.

The focus is on provision of information on when and what to do to adapt to the rising risk. A significant amount of damage to energy infrastructure in recent years has been a result of flooding. We determine that a facility is 'at risk' of damage if it is at risk of being flooded. We compare across climates the probability of a facility being flooded. If a scenario indicates that water level has reached the facility, through the combined effects of our physical risk factors, then we consider the facility flooded. We report our results as an annual probability of flooding and use these estimates in the decision making framework in Chapter 4. With increasing threats of climate change, response decisions are needed for infrastructure in harm's way. We consider there to be three types of responses here. The first is to continue with business as usual and to face the increasing risks of damage. The second is to abandon a facility. If the expected costs of damage are so high that they offset the benefit of running the facility, then abandoning the facility may be the least costly option. And third, is the option to build protective levees. With this last option, the decision options continue to include the optimal height and length of the levees and the best time to construct the levees or to add extra height to the levees. Of course other options include a combination of these three.

As described in Chapter 1, hurricanes require pre-existing weather disturbances, atmospheric moisture, warm ocean water, and light prevailing winds. The capacity to which these ideal conditions are met change with a warming climate and a different potential is reached for these seeds to develop into storms. As discussed, each climate model and time period produces a different distribution of storm intensities. Being able to use these distributions to anticipate storm arrivals in a given year requires each climate model to be calibrated. This calibration is done using a single Without this calibration, we would only see the proportional increase in storms within a model and not the actual anticipated frequency. The calibrated annual frequencies are listed in Table 3.1. Hurricane Arrival Process. We assume that hurricane arrival times are independent of one another and therefore follow a poisson distribution with annual frequency as the parameter. Given AF, we can calculate the probability of k storms occurring in one year; The probability distributions thus far show the risk of flooding given a storm arrival. We seek, however, to find the distribution of the annual risk of flooding instead. To do this, we use a numerical approximation to derive the resulting distribution from the poisson arrival process with annual frequency, AFi, as the poisson parameter . Since this is a poisson process, more than one storm could arrive in a given year. Define Nk, as the number of storm arrivals in one year. Of these arrivals, we only keep the highest resulting surge for our distribution since any lower surge height will be surpassed by the highest surge in that year. For this approximation, we sample 100,000 times by first sampling the number of storms, Nh., from a poisson distribution, then drawing N,, times from the distribution of storm surges given an arrival. We record the highest of the Nk. storms for our yearly arrival height. The result is a new distribution of the annual probability of surge heights.

Thermal Expansion", "text": "Since some of the models in the IPCC AR4 include thermal expansion in their output, we run our analysis off of these predictions, however, the four climate models used to study hurricane arrivals do not all include a sea level component, although they do include temperature change. We therefore derive a relationship between temperature and sea level rise using six GCMs from the IPCC AR4 that do include sea level output in their forecasts. These models are listed in Table 2.2 and their temperature projections and sea level rise projections are shown in Figures 3-7 and 3-8. From the results in Table 2.2, we run a regression (see We sample from this distribution, where T is the corresponding temperature of the models used for hurricane analysis, and linearly add the sea level rise contributions to the corresponding surge heights. We lose some accuracy in assuming a linear addition; as the ocean level rises, the shape of the coast line and the coastal bathymetry changes and has the potential to alter the resonance of the system. This ultimately affects the ways that waves move onto shore meaning that storm surges could be amplified or diminished with an additional sea level rise. However, we don't expect that an increase of 1-2m would alter the system enough to observe a change much different from a linear addition. Therefore, we accept this to be a rough approximation. Some studies of coastal risk add a scenario value of the WAIS and GIS effects to other coastal risk (e.g. Ning et al. 2012) which gives an impression of the total risk. However, to support the decision analysis framework developed here, an expression of the uncertainty in this effect is needed. (Adding a scenario value involves the implicit assumption that the ice sheet contribution is certain at the scenario value applied.) To facilitate the decision making process, we create a risk distribution to reflect the studies completed to date.

(Note that the risk analysis to be carried out in this chapter includes only the results from the GFDL model.) More generally, in Chapter 3 we also derived risk profiles for maximum yearly surge heights for both 2000 and 2100 climates. These risk profiles assume that no adaptation has taken place to date. As Galveston furthers the extent of its adaptation, however, we expect these risks to decrease. In this analysis, adaptation in response to the risks of coastal flooding means the construction of levees or sea walls to retain ocean water. Levees are meant to minimize or eliminate the impacts of storm surges and sea level rise on infrastructure up to a certain height. Levees do have the potential to fail, as was observed in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina. Their effectiveness therefore relies on the integrity of the structures, which can be reinforced through time. In this analysis we assume no failure and further assume that once a levee is constructed, the maintenance of structure is maintained through time. A possible extension of this analysis would be to allow for the structure to degrade and/or fail and should be considered in future work. For the purposes of our analysis, we consider the major constraints in adaptation to be those imposed by the costs of building and the costs of maintaining the levee structure. There is the option to build a levee at any point in time or to add to an existing levee at any point in time. Here we build a dynamic programming model to identify the most economical adaptation strategy over time."}, {"section_title": "Adaptation Strategy: Dynamic Programming", "text": "As risks increase over time, there is a growing need for adaptation. The decision making process to adapt at any point in time depends on both the current risk a facility is exposed to and its expected future risk. Sequential decision making can add a complication to how we make decisions. Decisions made today will affect the future and therefore affect future decision making. Similarly, future possible decisions could affect what decisions we make today. Most crucial are the immediate decisions made so we construct our analysis to ultimately inform present day decisions. In dynamic programming, during each time period, we consider the state of a facility and all possible decisions available within that state. For our analysis, the 'state' is the level of protection in place (i.e., the height of the levee in feet) and the decision 'action' options consist of the number of additional feet to build, including the option not to add any feet to the levee. The expected losses at any point in time is a function of future states and actions. We therefore begin optimizing in the last state and work our way backwards to our initial state. To limit the decision options we only consider adaptation options between 2000 and 2100, and we allow decisions for additional structures to be made at each decade (this means that the last state under consideration for decision making is the 2090-2 100). Further, we allow for up to a 20 foot tall levee to be added, as low as 0 feet, and on a 2 foot increment for options in between. Define St and At(St) to be the state and best action respectively at time t, and let Vt(St) be defined as the lowest expected costs at time t in state St. Further, let Ct(St, A) be the expected costs at time t given state St and action At. Since we choose to look at decisions made every decade, each of these costs are accumulated over the decade, with the discount rate of r. We obtain probabilities of yearly inundation by interpolating between our two probability distributions shown in (1 + r)0 x D x Pt(( > ( + St + At), (4.4) where D is the damage incurred by a flooded facility. By iterating backwards over time, we are able to derive the optimal wall height for each state. We illustrate this method using a case of a Surge height (feet) The decision framework was also tested on a risk profile that remains constant over time, the profile identical to the 2000 climate. This means no changes in sea level or hur-ricane activity would occur over a century. Regardless of this, the results still suggest to build a wall, but only one that is 6 feet in height (see Figure 4-3), 2 feet less than what our decision would be with a different future set of risks.  (column 1, row 1). This framework also allows us to make sequential decisions in the situation where the optimal decision is infeasible at the given time period. If a wall is unaffordable today or if certain regulations restrict the construction of a wall now, we can still make near-optimal decisions in a subsequent decade in accordance with our analysis. For instance, if a sea wall can't be constructed in 2000 but is feasible in 2020, then the expected accumulated costs in 2020 will be $50 million (column 3, row 1).

For our decision analysis we choose a facility sitting at five feet above current mean sea levels in Galveston Bay and assume a similar damage potential as a 200,000 barrel per day refinery that was flooded during Hurricane Katrina. We consider the option to protect a facility by constructing sea walls, versus the option of leaving the facility unprotected. Through dynamic programming we derive the optimal decision making sequence for each decade in order to minimize total expected costs. We find under our assumptions that for a facility at five feet above mean sea level, the annual risk of flooding today is about I % and that this risk increases to somewhere between 38 and 47% by 2100. This method provides an integrated risk assessment for facilities in Galveston Bay and would be a useful tool in determining the extent of protection that an operating facility could benefit from. This method can be more broadly applied to any coastal region with vulnerable infrastructure, or vulnerable assets by adjusting the probability distributions from the contributing factors to better reflect the impacts specific to those regions. The expected costs must also be adjusted to reflect the value of the facility under consideration."}, {"section_title": "Applications to Public Policy", "text": "As the nature of our weather patterns and environmental systems change, the policies governing human activities should be adjusted to reflect that change. Through our analysis, we've concluded that coastal energy infrastructure will become more vulnerable to inundation with a changing climate and contributing impacts of subsidence. Flood-related policies should therefore be developed to reflect this changing risk. Further attention should be paid to the contributing factors to increased risk of inundation. We highlight two of contributing factors here, the first being climate change. There exists a large body of literature that addresses the policy options and challenges for mitigating against future climate change outcomes. The scale of these policy options are considered on national and international platforms and while it is a critical topic that should not be overlooked, it is beyond the scope of our more regional analysis. The second contributing factor to increased risk is subsidence, largely as a result of the removal of groundwater; the removal of minerals, oil or gas can also contribute to subsidence but groundwater removal has been noted to be the most crucial contributing factor in locations experiencing severe subsidence. If we look towards a favorable longterm outcome, we may be interested in developing policies to minimize the potential for subsidence. This could be restricting the rate of groundwater removal or replenishing the water table after the fact. The trouble with replenishing the water table is that a source of clean water is needed to replenish it with if we are to avoid contaminating the water supply. This would defeat the purpose, however, of removing water in the first place. Developing careful regulations for the amount and rate of ground-water removal is crucial to minimizing the subsidence rates in the United States. Research has shown that decision makers' perception of risk is based on their rationality assumptions whereas investor's perception of risk is driven by their perceived storm risk . As we look to develop policies appropriate for changing risks, it is important that decision makers are therefore well informed of the true changing risks. Further coastal analysis to the vulnerability to climate change would be needed to provide this insight."}, {"section_title": "Future Work", "text": "There are a number of components to this analysis that require improvements. The following are a few of the items that should be addressed in future work."}, {"section_title": "Modelling the changing environmental risks", "text": "-Expand emission scenarios to include more scenarios other than Al B which is under criticism for over-predicting short-term economic growth. * The sea level probability distributions used in this analysis were derived from the best predictions available to us at the time of the study. As the science behind sea level rise develops further, the probability distributions for sea level heights should be modified to better reflect these scientific developments. -We included a triangular distribution for subsidence to indicate the major uncertainties in these predictions. Future work should involve subsidence models that incorporate potential policies to limit ground water extraction and better reflect the true risks of future subsidence. . The analysis should be applied to different locations along the United States coast line. The features of Galveston make it specifically vulnerable and the severity of infrastructure vulnerability is anticipated to be less severe in different locations. Applying this methodology to different locations would give us a better idea of the degree to which other coastal infrastructure are exposed to increased threats of inundation. Given the complexity of this analysis, however, applications to different locations would be more feasible with the development of a reduced form model."}, {"section_title": "Infrastructure decision analysis", "text": ". In the dynamic decision making process, the options were to either continue with business as usual or adapt by constructing a sea wall. A third option would be to allow for abandonment in the decision making process. This option should be considered in future work. -We've assumed in this analysis that once a levee is constructed that it is adequately maintained through time, indefinitely. In reality, there is the option to build a levee and not maintain it. This option should be considered in our analysis and would also impact the risk of failure. This risk of failure should therefore also be incorporated into the model and into the decision making process. -Our analysis was based on existing infrastructure in Galveston Bay and neglected to incorporate potential future infrastructure in the region. To fully understand the true magnitude of future damage, we should better incorporate economic projections and future potential infrastructure into our analysis."}]
