[{"section_title": "!", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "In areas associated with high levels of urbanization, there is significant alteration of estuarine habitat by fragmentation resulting in a mosaic of habitat sizes and shapes, and variation in the abiotic environment (Lowe and Peterson, 2014). This anthropogenic habitat modification has resulted in positive, negative, or neutral changes in the diversity and population dynamics of free-living communities (Lotze et al., 2006;Aronson et al., 2014). For parasites, transmission from one host to another involves life stages external to the host along with life stages forming the durable within-host association. Consequently, the effect of urbanization on parasite populations and communities may then be twofold; either directly through changes to, and variation in, the abiotic environment (e.g., availability of contaminants and altered physicochemical parameters, e.g., Anderson and Sukhdeo, 2010;Blanar et al., 2011;Pietrock and Marcogliese, 2003;Morley et al., 2003); or indirectly through modification of host population dynamics (e.g., Hechinger et al., 2007;Anderson and Sukhdeo, 2013a). The mechanism by which regional urbanization affects local abiotic and biotic conditions, and potentially the transmission and establishment of parasites is likely mediated by the construction of impervious surfaces (Paul and Meyer, 2001). Impervious surfaces increase the volume and rate of terrestrial runoff following rain events, leading to more frequent introductions and higher concentrations of contaminants and freshwater into estuarine habitats, with a range of effects on free-living organisms (Sanger et al., 1999). For example, a regional landscape analysis by Lerberg et al. (2000) found that the watersheds that contained greater than 50% impervious surfaces were associated with higher concentrations of metals (Cu, Cr, Pb, Zn, Cd, and Hg) resulting in a decrease in the abundance and richness of crustaceans and bivalves. Hutchins et al. (2014) found a positive correlation between the amount of impervious surfaces in a regional .

In a study contrasting urban and undeveloped estuaries, Krebs et al. (2014) demonstrated that urban estuaries had lower, variable salinities, resulting in altered fish community structure. Additional studies have demonstrated how thermal effluent associated with industrial discharge in estuaries alters fish growth rate and the fish community (Jones et al., 1996), and how human development may alter pH, dissolved organic matter, and oxygen concentration affecting foraminiferal faunas (Hayward et al., 2004). A common theme among these studies is that the regional construction of impervious surfaces alters the local abiotic environment via increases in contaminant amounts and variation in physicochemical parameters, generally resulting in significant changes to the free-living community. The free-living community, and changes in its diversity and dynamics due to urbanization, is likely to affect the diversity and richness of parasites for two reasons. Firstly, the host is exploited as an energy source and critical habitat, and over evolutionary time this has resulted in parasite life strategies that are integrally coupled with host species dynamics. This essential interaction has been used to demonstrate how parasites can be indicators of free-living diversity (Hechinger et al., 2007), and it has been argued that a healthy ecosystem is one that is rich in parasites (Hudson et al., 2006). Further, complex life cycle parasites are largely dependent upon trophic interactions, which occur more frequently in locally stable communities (Anderson and Sukhdeo, 2013a). In increasingly urbanized salt marshes, host population dynamics may be less stable, resulting in reduced diversity or less predictable host dynamics, causing a concomitant decrease in the richness of parasites (Anderson and Sukhdeo, 2013b). Concurrently, a feature of increasingly urbanized salt marshes is habitat fragmentation, resulting in higher densities of hosts .

Higher host densities may lead to increased abundance of directly transmitted parasites, as the probability of a parasite transmission stage encountering a suitable host is increased (Arneberg et al., 1998). Many of the studies that examine the interaction between host and parasite in urbanized ecosystems have been conducted with human pathogens (Bradley and Altizer, 2007), on a local spatial scale (Anderson and Sukhdeo, 2010;Blanar et al., 2011), or consider a single host and a single parasite (Johnson et al., 2009). Further, linking the regional process of urbanization to local transmission and diversity of parasite communities has yet to reveal consistent patterns (Schotthoefer et al., 2011;Chapman et al., 2015;Blanar et al., 2016;Johnson et al., 2016). One potential explanation for the absence of consistent results is that urbanization differentially affects parasite species: the size and direction of effect is contingent upon parasite life history. For example, Blanar et al. (2016) demonstrated a correlation between parasite community structure and local contaminants and land use within 5 km. In this study, the relative abundance of the complex life-cycle digenean was positively associated with an increase in crude oil contaminants, whereas the opposite pattern was observed for the directly transmitted monogeneans. This observation follows results of an earlier meta-analysis, where parasite life history (>1 obligatory host in life cycle vs. 1 obligatory host in life cycle) and habitat (external vs. internal) informed whether aquatic pollution had a significant effect on parasite population dynamics (Blanar et al., 2009). In this study, we assessed the effect of regional urbanization and the local abiotic environment on the parasite community of the salt marsh fish, Fundulus heteroclitus, within 6 salt marshes. We asked whether local factors, such as host size and the immediate abiotic environment, or if regional landscape factors, such as land-use change and composition, were more important in .

We predicted that urban salt marshes would be characterized by a high degree of regional habitat fragmentation and poor local abiotic conditions (e.g., reduced water quality with nutrient enrichment and high contaminant concentrations).

Regional landscape composition and change were measured using ArcGIS (ArcGIS Version 10.3, Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands, California).

To extract chlorophyll a, we followed a standard acidification method (EPA 445.0), whereby a volume of 100 ml was filtered using Whatman GF/F filters (47 mm; 0.7 \u00b5m nominal pore size). Phytoplankton pigments were then extracted from the filters in 8 ml of 90 % acetone at 0 \u00b0C for 24 hours.

In addition, the home range estimates of killifish are in concordance with our measure of local urbanization (% impervious surface within a 250 m radius of each site) (Lotrich, 1975;Teo and Able, 2003). At each site, killifish were collected using 5 minnow traps baited with dry dog food. Traps were placed during the flood tide and collected during the ebb tide in March 2015, with subsequent collections in June 2015, September 2015, and February 2016. We randomly subsampled each collection to 30 killifish from each site on each collection date. The fish were housed in the animal facility at Georgia Southern University and necropsied within 1 week (IACUC #I14013).

All trace metal and nutrient concentration data were log transformed to meet the assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variances. If a significant difference was found (P < 0.05), a post-hoc multiple pairwise comparison using Tukey's honest significance test was performed. To test for differences in parasite component community species richness between sites, we conducted a Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA (our data did not meet the parametric assumptions of normality and equal variances). We followed this analysis with a post-hoc multiple pairwise comparison using the Steel-Dwass test (JMP Pro 12.0.0, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). To visualize the variation in parasite component community structure, we performed nonmetric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS). In the NMDS, average abundances of parasite species in each component community were calculated and square root transformed to control for the effect of high abundance parasite taxa. A resemblance matrix was constructed using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity distance, and stress was calculated using Kruskal's stress formula 1. To determine whether there were significant differences in parasite component community structure, we performed a permutational multivariate ANOVA (PerMANOVA). For this analysis, we used site as a factor and performed 999 permutations. As an overall significant difference was found (P < 0.05), we performed post-hoc pairwise PerMANOVA tests to identify differences among the factor levels, and used the Bonferroni correction to preserve the type I error rate. In addition to the posthoc pairwise PerMANOVA tests, we performed a two-way crossed similarity percentage (SIMPER) analysis to identify the parasite species that contributed to 5% or greater of the variation in component community structure between sites (PRIMER-E LTD., Plymouth, UK).

Prior to this analysis, we conducted a variable reduction process to simplify the 48 water and 65 sediment trace metal and nutrient concentration data (JMP Pro 12.0.0, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). This analysis generated a correlation matrix of the log transformed concentration data, placed all variables in one cluster, and then conducted binary splits based on the magnitude of the second eigenvalues. Variables were iteratively reassigned to clusters, and cluster membership was finalized when the squared correlation to the first principal component was highest. In each cluster, the variable that explained the most variation was used in the subsequent regression tree and random forest analysis. In the regression tree and random forest analyses the response variable was parasite species richness and the predictor variables were host characteristics such as size and sex, local abiotic measures determined through the PCA variable reduction process, and the complete set of regional abiotic metrics. To avoid overfitting, we used a cost-complexity algorithm to prune the regression tree: this algorithm removed auxiliary nodes that would result in no significant loss in the mean square error (De'ath and Fabricius, 2000).

The sites, selected on an urbanization gradient, had significantly different parasite component community composition and richness. Variation in the prevalence and intensity of infection by complex life cycle parasites, the digenean Lasiotocus minutus and the cestode Glossocercus caribaensis, were the primary cause for the differences in the parasite communities between sites. Although the prevalence of direct life cycle parasites differed among sites, this difference did not contribute to the overall variation in community composition. The best predictors of parasite infracommunity richness included local and regional measures: host size, % regional salt marsh, and patch density. The data do not support the prediction that regional urbanization is linearly associated with decreased parasite infracommunity richness; rather, our results suggest that habitat size, both local and regional, and landscape heterogeneity have differential effects on structuring the parasite community mediated by parasite life history. Complex life cycle parasites can be broadly classified as autogenic, where the parasite species completes its entire life cycle within the confines of an aquatic system, or allogenic where the parasite uses hosts that are outside the aquatic environment (Esch et al., 1988). The extension of this concept is that the local abiotic environment will have a greater effect on autogenic parasites, as the parasites and hosts are continuously exposed to the aquatic environment.

This pattern was expected, as this parasite and associated hosts are continuously exposed to the external aquatic environment, and would be exposed to any contaminants or deleterious physicochemical parameters. The second complex life cycle parasite, the metacestode of G. caribaensis, is allogenic, and did not follow the same pattern as L. minutus, and was prevalent in a site that had a high amount of impervious surface. This allogenic cestode has fish-eating birds as definitive hosts and infects a number of fish intermediate hosts (Scholz et al, 2004). This pattern was not expected, as there are still life stages where the parasite and hosts are exposed to the external aquatic environment. However, it is plausible to suggest that because the parasite spends less time in the aquatic environment the parasite has a lesser risk of exposure to contaminants or deleterious physicochemical parameters. Further, G. caribaensis has a vagile definitive host that may select habitat outside of urbanized salt marshes, lessening the impact of local and regional urbanization. Consequently, the difference in prevalence across sites may be due to the effect of the abiotic condition on parasite life stages external to the host, or through effects on critical aquatic life cycle hosts, such as the mollusc (Anderson and Sukhdeo, 2010). Local abiotic factors have the potential to adversely impact the environmental stages of parasites. For example, higher concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus result in greater mortality in Fasciola hepatica cercariae (Brglez and Wikerhauser, 1968), and experiments have demonstrated that survival of cercarial Philophtalmus sp. is reduced at lower salinities compared to survival at normal and high salinity (Lei and Poulin 2011). Similarly, Siddall and Des Clers (1994) demonstrated that exposure to sewage sludge in seawater lowered the viability of cercariae and miracidia of the digenean, Zoogonoides viviparus, due to trace concentrations of heavy metals such as Hg, Cu, Cd, and Pb. However, our data show that local abiotic parameters (e.g., pH, temperature, salinity, nitrogen, phosphorus) did not vary significantly across the sites, and the regression tree and random forest analyses did not associate any local abiotic factor with parasite species richness. Consequently, the dynamics we observe for the autogenic parasite, the digenean L. minutus, are more likely to be determined by changes to the host population rather than affects on life stages exposed to the environment. Areas with higher levels of impervious surface are likely associated with stressors that affect host populations. For example, King et al. (2004) demonstrated that the survival of the marine bivalve Tellina deltoidalis could decrease to less than 10% in low salinity waters, which is a common occurrence in urbanized watersheds following rain events. In a study germane to ours, Hattenrath et al. (2010) manipulated nutrient concentrations in a marine system and found that a toxin-producing dinoflagellate, Alexandrium fundyense, had a 4-fold increase in abundance and toxin densities increased 8-fold. The nutrient concentrations in this experiment were parameterized by field data collected during two harmful algal blooms in 2007 and 2008 that were associated with large-scale bivalve population declines (Hattenrath et al., 2010). One striking pattern in our data was an almost linear increase in chlorophyll a across the 6 sites, i.e., sites with more impervious surfaces had a higher concentration of chlorophyll a (Table 4). Chlorophyll a concentration is a proxy for phytoplankton abundance, and can be associated with eutrophication and harmful algal blooms (Anderson et al., 2002). Further, chlorophyll a is often elevated in estuaries nested in a developed landscape (Reed et al., 2016). The chlorophyll a values in our study are not indicative of harmful algal blooms, but the linear increase in concentration suggests that water quality is impacted. Though we did not measure mollusc abundance, it is plausible to suggest that the elevated chlorophyll a levels and the consequent reduction in water quality affect the molluscan first intermediate host and subsequently the observed parasite communities. Through regression tree and random forest analyses, we demonstrated that host size was the strongest determinant of parasite species richness in F. heteroclitus. Generally, larger hosts contain more area for a parasite to colonize, allowing for a greater number of niches and concurrent species (Guegan et al., 1992;Morand and Poulin, 1998). This species-area relationship is one of the more consistent patterns in ecology (Arrhenius, 1921;Macarthur and Wilson, 1963), and parasitologists have regularly found positive correlations between host size and infracommunity richness (Rigby and Lawton, 1981;Morand et al., 2000;Behnke et al., 2001;Timi and Poulin, 2003;Kamiya et al., 2014). Our data demonstrate the opposite; that the strongest predictor for a high infracommunity richness was a host with a smaller body size, which is in accordance with a growing body of literature that finds no relationship between size and parasite richness (Feliu et al., 1997;Krasnov et al., 2004;Korallo et al., 2007). Strona and Fattorini (2014) have argued that ecological processes (e.g., competition and coextinction avoidance) are the more important determinants of species richness, and the host size-species richness pattern is not a general phenomenon (Guegan and Kennedy, 1993;Strona and Lafferty, 2013). Further, Sukhdeo (2011, 2013a) found that the predictors of parasite species richness in F. heteroclitus were associated with ecological interactions and trophic generality. We suggest a similar explanation for our data: smaller F. heteroclitus have a wider diet breadth facilitating infection by complex life cycle parasites, and they also form higher density schools facilitating direct transmission parasite establishment. This proposition is supported by Thompson (2015) who found that F. heteroclitus displayed differential size-selective foraging where small individuals were more likely to consume a diverse diet, consequently increasing the opportunity for infection by multiple trophically transmitted parasite species. In addition, small F. heteroclitus individuals in Georgia are generally restricted to surface pools in intertidal zone habitats resulting in increased density which would likely increase direct parasite transmission (Kneib, 1987). Surface pools may also act as focal points for complex life cycle transmission as small individuals in these pools are vulnerable to predation by bird definitive hosts (Butner and Brattstrom, 1960;Kneib, 1982). Thus, in this system, the negative relationship between body size and parasite richness is most likely due to correlates with body size, such as trophic generality and other ecological interactions. The secondary predictors for parasite infracommunity richness in F. heteroclitus were associated with regional variables; the % regional salt marsh and patch density. Using a Daphnia model system with 16 parasite taxa, Ebert et al. (2001) determined that time since colonization, and pool volume -a proxy for host population size -were positively correlated with parasite richness. To explain an increase of within-habitat transmission rates, they invoked principles from general epidemiological models, arguing that the structure of the system allowed a lower persistence threshold size for the parasite (Anderson and May, 1978;1981;Gregory, 1990). A low threshold allows for more parasite species to overcome that host density threshold and persist (Dobson et al., 1992). The data from the present study similarly supports these models and the observations of Ebert et al. (2001): larger contiguous areas of salt marsh patches, i.e. a greater % salt marsh, likely contain a larger host population size, sustaining greater parasite species richness. This proposition is further supported by Rudershausen et al. (2016) who determined that F. heteroclitus population size was associated with creeks that had watersheds with high percentages of contiguous marsh. Thus, the sites with a large % regional salt marsh likely contain larger population sizes of F. heteroclitus, increasing the chances of a parasite encountering a suitable host and establishing in the host population. Coastal urbanization and anthropogenic disturbance are rapidly altering free-living and parasite community dynamics. Our results suggest that regional urbanization may not always negatively affect parasite species richness. The factors that influence the richness of the observed parasite community are both local and regional, and the degree to which individual parasite species respond to urbanization is determined by life-history strategy. Further, our data do not align with the relatively general pattern relating species richness and host (habitat) size; instead, we suggest that species richness in this system is determined by the interactions between free-living hosts and their environment which is then detected as variation in the parasite community.
