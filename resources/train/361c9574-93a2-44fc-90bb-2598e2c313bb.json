[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "To examine the potential contribution of severity of lumbopelvic pain (LPP) in well-functioning older adults to poorer walking efficiency, lack of endurance, slower gait speed, and decline in these mobility parameters over 1 to 5 years. DESIGN: Longitudinal analysis of Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging data. SETTING: National Institute on Aging, Clinical Research Unit, Baltimore, Maryland. PARTICIPANTS: Well-functioning men and women aged 60 to 89 (N5878). MEASUREMENTS: An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to ascertain reported presence and severity of back and hip pain in the preceding 12 months and reported walking ability, including ease of walking a mile. Certified examiners assessed usual gait speed, the energetic cost of walking (oxygen consumption, mL per kg/m), and time taken to walk 400 m as quickly as possible. Covariates included sex, age, age-squared, race, height, weight, exercise, and smoking. RESULTS: Overall, 31.4% had mild LPP, and 15.7% had moderate to severe LPP. In adjusted analyses, reported walking ability (p<.001), endurance walk performance (p5.007), and energetic cost of walking (p5.049) were worse with increasing LPP severity. Usual gait speed did not vary according to LPP (p5.31). Longitudinally, over an average 2.3 years, persons with new or sustained LPP had worse follow-up level, greater mean decline, and higher likelihood of meaningful decline in reported walking ability than persons free of LPP or whose LPP resolved. Walking performance did not differ according to LPP follow-up status. CONCLUSION: LPP was common in well-functioning older adults and was associated with greater energetic cost of walking and poorer perceived and observed walking endurance. The longitudinal effect of LPP is unclear, but worsening perception of walking ability and its contribution to future mobility loss warrants further attention.

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Over the past 15 years, a wealth of research has revealed the functional consequences of back pain, [1] [2] [3] [6] [7] [8] [9] yet there are important gaps with respect to well-functioning older adults; that is, persons with no walking limitations and whether back pain may serve as a catalyst for mobility decline through its potential contribution to poorer walking efficiency and related manifestations, including compromised walking endurance, slower gait speed, and faster decline in mobility parameters over time. 10 Most investigations of back pain in older adults have examined more general populations in which mobility limitations are highly prevalent 11, 12 or focused on lowerorder tasks and abilities, 12, 13 which may be insensitive indicators of mobility deficits in well-functioning older adults. 3, 8, 14, 15 The scant research on back pain and energetic efficiency has used small samples and has been largely inconclusive. 16 Additionally, persons reporting back pain often have low physical activity, 17, 18 raising the possibility that back pain's effect on mobility may be underappreciated because low activity may obscure the consequences of intermittent or lingering back pain. Lastly, pain severity 19 and persistence over time 20 have been largely overlooked with respect to mobility decline.\nThis study examined the relationship between lumbopelvic pain (LPP), operationalized as reported back or hip pain, within the preceding year and mobility, assessed as usual gait speed, endurance walk performance, energetic cost of walking, and reported walking ability, in wellfunctioning persons aged 60 to 89 participating in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). Because LPP is frequently chronic 21 and recurrent, 22 this study also investigated the association between LPP follow-up status and mobility change 1 to 5 years later."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Population", "text": "The study population consists of 878 well-functioning men and women (50.8%) aged 60 to 89 participating in the BLSA who reported on pain in the back, hips, and knees over the previous year, met eligibility for endurance walk testing (no major contraindications for fitness testing or exacerbation of cardiac symptoms in the preceding 3 months), completed a 400-m walk as quickly as possible, and had a measure of the energetic cost of walking (see below). The first visit in which all criteria were met was termed the index visit.\nThe longitudinal sample consisted of 667 participants who had at least 1 follow-up visit within 1 to 5 years after their index visit (mean 2.3 years) in which LPP and usual gait speed were both assessed. Those without an eligible follow-up were not due or overdue for a visit (n5101), were seen more than 5 years after their index visit (n518), had a telephone interview only (n515), or were missing back pain status (n54). Twenty-two had died, 15 developed dementia or became incapacitated, 3 withdrew, and 33 were lost to follow-up. Participants without eligible follow-up were younger (70.4 vs 72.1; p5.007) and had a lower energetic cost of walking (0.156 vs 0.165 oxygen consumption (VO 2 ; mL per kg/m; p<.001) but did not differ in any other key characteristics. An additional 161 participants were unavailable for longitudinal analyses on the energetic cost of walking because of missing data; 30 did not qualify for testing, and 131 did not have oxygen consumption assessed because the equipment was being serviced. All visits occurred between April 2007 and March 2017.\nThe BLSA began in 1958 as a continuous-enrollment cohort study of normative aging, with eligibility restricted to persons free of cognitive impairment, functional limitations, chronic diseases, and cancer within the previous 10 years. Once enrolled, participants are followed until death through comprehensive health, cognitive, and functional evaluations conducted during a 3-day visit to the National Institute on Aging Clinical Research Unit in Baltimore, Maryland. Visits occur every other year for persons aged 60 to 79 and annually for persons aged 80 and older. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences internal review board approved the BLSA protocol, and participants provided informed consent at all visits."}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Lumbopelvic Pain", "text": "Presence and severity of LPP was determined from interviewer-administered questions: \"In the past year, have you had any back pain?\" Participants responding \"yes\" were asked, \"Please rate your usual back pain over the past year from 0 to 10.\" Persons denying pain or endorsing a level of 0 were coded as having no back pain (0). Those endorsing a pain level from 1 to 5 were considered to have mild pain (1) , and those endorsing a pain level of 6 or greater were coded as having moderate to severe pain (2) . Persons ever having hip pain were asked, \"In the past 12 months, have you had hip pain lasting at least one month?\" Those responding \"yes\" were asked, for each affected hip, usual pain severity in the past 12 monthsmild, moderate, severe, or extreme. Those reporting no pain were coded 0, those with mild pain were coded 1, and those with moderate or worse pain were coded 2. If pain was reported for both hips, severity was the highest pain level endorsed for either hip. LPP score represents the sum of back and hip pain and can range from 0 to 4 but was truncated at 2 because scores of 3 (2.5%) and 4 (1.6%) were rare, yielding three pain levels (05none, 15mild, 25moderate to severe).\nThe same approach categorized LPP at follow-up. For the longitudinal analyses, LPP status at the index and follow-up visits were compared, yielding four categorizations. Participants with no pain at both visits were labeled absent, those with any pain at the index visit but not at follow-up were labeled resolved, those free of pain at the index visit but reporting pain at follow-up were labeled new onset, and those with pain at both visits were labeled persistent. Because LPP that developed or resolved between visits was not captured, it is best to consider these categories as gross summaries of LPP status over time."}, {"section_title": "Knee Pain", "text": "Because pain typically co-occurs in multiple locations in older adults, 2 and knee pain has been associated with higher energetic costs of walking, 23 we included knee pain as a covariate in separate analyses. Participants reporting ever having knee pain were asked whether they had had knee pain lasting at least 1 month within the last 12 months and the pain level in the affected knees within the past 30 days while walking on a flat surface. Those reporting no pain were coded 0, those endorsing mild pain were coded 1, and those experiencing moderate or worse pain were coded 2."}, {"section_title": "Reported Walking Ability", "text": "Perceived walking ability was determined by asking: \"Because of a health or physical problem, do you have any difficulty walking one-quarter of a mile, that is, about 2 or 3 blocks, without stopping?\" Those reporting difficulty were asked whether they had a little, some, or a lot of difficulty or were unable to walk. Persons denying difficulty were asked how easy it was for them to walk one-quarter of a mile-very, somewhat, or not so easyfollowed by whether they have any difficulty walking 1 mile and the ease of walking 1 mile if no difficulty was reported. Responses were combined to create a walking ability index ranging from 0 to 9, with 0 representing unable to walk one-quarter of a mile and 9 indicating that walking 1 mile is very easy. 24 Meaningful decline at follow-up was defined as a loss of 1 point. 24, 25 Usual Gait Speed Usual gait speed was assessed over 6 m, with participants asked to walk at their usual walking pace for 2 trials. Total time recorded to the hundredth of a second was divided by 6 to obtain usual gait speed in meters per second. The fastest trial was used in the analyses. Meaningful decline was defined as a loss of 0.05 m/s per year. 25, 26 Endurance Walk Performance Endurance walk performance is derived from the LongDistance Corridor Walk (LDCW), a 2-stage endurance walk test performed over a 20-m course 27 in a tiled corridor. The first stage consists of a 2.5-minute usual-pace walk, followed immediately by a 400-m walk done as quickly as possible. Seconds required to complete the 400-m walk was the measure of endurance walk performance.

An increase of 0.006 VO 2 , mL per kg/m per year was used to signify meaningful decline, which is analogous to a loss of 0.05 m/s per year for usual gait speed. 29 "}, {"section_title": "Covariates", "text": "Covariates include age, age-squared (to account for accelerated slowing with age), self-designated black or nonblack race, physical activity, and smoking status (current or quit within 10 years vs never or quit >10 years before).

Measured height and weight were also accounted for in the analyses."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analyses", "text": "In the cross-sectional analyses, mean values of the mobility measures-reported walking ability, usual gait speed, 400-m walk time, and energetic cost of walking-were compared across categories of LPP designated as none, mild, or moderate to severe using separate general linear models adjusted for age, age-squared, sex, race, height and weight, smoking, and activity level. A second set of separate models included knee pain.\nTo examine the longitudinal association between LPP and mobility, LPP status at the index and follow-up visits was compared to yield four categories-absent, resolved, new onset, and persistent (see above). Follow-up mobility was examined using raw follow-up value, change between index and follow-up visits, and percentage experiencing meaningful decline. Separate general linear models adjusted for age, age-squared, sex, race, height, weight, smoking, activity level, and length of follow-up were used to examine differences between the LPP follow-up categories and each mobility outcome. The index value was included in models examining change and percentage experiencing meaningful decline. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). Table 1 illustrates the joint prevalence and severity of back and hip pain at the index visit. Back pain was common, affecting 47%, whereas hip pain occurred in only 8%, the large majority of whom (76%) also reported back pain. Only 16 persons (< 2%) reported hip pain alone. Of those with back pain, 22% reported moderate to severe pain, whereas of those with hip pain, nearly 70% reported moderate or greater severity. Table 2 compares population characteristics according to LPP category; 52.9% had no LPP, 31.4% had mild LPP, and 15.7% had moderate to severe LPP. The average age of the study population was 71.7, 50.8% were female, and 24.0% were black. In this well-functioning population, fewer than 4% had smoked within the previous 10 years, and more than 40% met physical activity recommendations. Those with LPP were more likely to be sedentary and black and to report knee pain in the past year. LPP is the sum of back pain and hip pain, not to exceed 2. Thus, 464 persons had a LPP score of 0 (no shading), 276 had a score of 1 (light shading), and 138 had a score of 2 (darkest shading)."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Cross-Sectional", "text": "Adjusted cross-sectional associations between LPP and mobility are depicted in Figure 1 . Reported walking ability was worse with increasing LPP severity (p<.001), with the moderate to severe group having poorer walking ability than those with no or mild LPP (p<.001 for both). Differences between those with no pain and those with mild pain did not attain statistical significance (p5.10). Usual gait speed did not vary according to LPP status (p5.31). Endurance walk performance was worse with increasing LPP (p5.007), but only those with moderate to severe pain needed more time to walk 400 m than those with mild (p5.002) or no (p5.005) pain. Energetic cost of walking was slightly higher with increasing LPP (p5.049). Participants with any pain and those with moderate to severe LPP had higher energetic cost of walking than those with no pain (p<.03 for both).\nAccounting for knee pain in the past year did not materially affect the findings, with the exception of the energetic cost of walking.

Participants with new-onset LPP had greater mean decline and higher percentage with meaningful decline than persons in the resolved group. No differences emerged between follow-up LPP status and usual gait speed, 400-m walk time, or energetic cost of walking."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "In a well-functioning population aged 60 to 89, LPP commonly occurred, with more than 47% reporting pain within the preceding year and more than 62% having LPP at their index or follow-up visit, of whom two-fifths had moderate to severe pain. These rates are higher than found in some studies of older adults 1-3 but comparable with those found in others, 4, 5 which may reflect differences in pain assessment and participant characteristics. Although hip pain was included in the definition used here, hip pain alone accounted for fewer than 2% of LPP cases. The population examined here was not only well functioning, but also highly active, with more than 40% spending at least 150 minutes per week in exercise-related activities, in contrast to approximately 3% of the general population of older adults. 30 The higher activity levels may explain the high rates of LPP, but whether greater activity contributes to LPP or increases awareness of existing LPP cannot be distinguished. Nevertheless, this observation that LPP prevalence is high in a highly active population supports the concern noted previously that inactivity may obscure prevalent back pain and that the effect of back pain on walking endurance may be underappreciated.\nContemporaneous pain severity over the preceding year was associated with reported and observed endurance-related walking, including energetic cost but not usual gait speed over a short distance, which suggests that, in well-functioning older adults, simple gait speed is an insensitive marker of LPP-related debility and, more importantly, that LPP may initiate early-stage mobility loss, which first emerges as diminished endurance capacity and greater energetic costs of walking. 29, 31 Absence of any effect of knee pain on the observed associations between LPP severity and mobility may reflect that knee pain was rarer (<4%) in those with no LPP than in in those with moderate to severe LPP (15%) and that LPP severity largely drove the relationship with mobility.\nThe only associations between LPP status over time involved reported walking ability, with persons with new or persistent LPP reporting lower ability levels at follow-up and experiencing greater decline between visits than persons with no or resolved LPP. The differences were statistically robust in contrast to endurance walk performance and energetic cost of walking, which showed no hint of difference. Typically, performance-based measures are considered more Association adjusted for age, age squared, sex, race, height, weight, smoking, activity level, length of follow-up, and baseline mobility for change and meaningful decline only. P-values in the \"Resolved\" row compare resolved and absent groups. The first p-value in the \"New onset\" row compares new onset with absent and the second p-value compares new onset with resolved. The first p-value in the \"Persistent\" row compares persistent with absent and the second p-value compares persistent with resolved. Total N's available for follow-up and change analyses were 666 for walking ability, 667 for usual gait speed, 630 for 400-m walk time, and 506 for energetic cost of walking.\nsensitive than self-report, 31 but perhaps the target distance of 1 mile for the self-report assessment, versus 400 m, and 2.5 minutes for energetic cost of walking makes self-report the more sensitive early marker. Alternatively, LPP may be perceived as making walking less easy even with no evident decline in maximum speed or energetic efficiency in a testing situation. When participants reported moderate to severe pain of any type at their previsit screen, they were encouraged to reschedule for a later date. Thus, self-report may have more accurately captured perceived walking ability in the presence of intermittent or recurrent LPP, whereas performance tests conducted in a research setting may underestimate the functional effect of LPP.\nNevertheless, the lack of association between LPP over time and worsening endurance walk performance and energetic cost was unanticipated given evidence of a cumulative or long-term negative effect of LPP on mobility, 19, 20 especially in light of the observed decline in reported walking ability. The potential implications of worse perceived walking ability for walking endurance and efficiency may depend on how individuals respond to diminished ease of walking, and even then, the consequences of any activity restriction for sustained mobility decline may not emerge until much later.\nThis study has limitations typical of cohort-based investigations of pain and its manifestations, most notably that persons in acute pain were encouraged to postpone their clinic visit and the lack of interim pain assessment between clinic visits, which tend to obscure prevalence, severity, and recurrence of LPP. Nevertheless, the observed point prevalence of 47%, of which one-third complained of moderate to severe pain, was greater than typically observed. [1] [2] [3] Additionally, because of insufficient power, the longitudinal analyses did not differentiate pain severity, which may have diminished the ability to observe an association between LPP follow-up status and walking performance, especially because the moderate to severe group had the worst walking initially. This is supported in part by examining the 100 participants who developed (n527), progressed to (n533), or had sustained moderate to severe LPP (n540) at follow-up. This subgroup, as expected, had a lower level of and greater decline and a higher proportion with meaningful decline in reported walking ability than all other follow-up LPP status groups and also experienced a higher rate of meaningful decline in 400-m walk performance (33.6% vs 23.9%; p5.048) than persons with no LPP at either visit.\nIn summary, LPP in well-functioning older adults is associated with higher energetic cost of walking and poorer reported and observed endurance walking ability. Aside from a reduction in reported walking ability, the longer-term consequences of LPP are unclear and may depend on how individuals and their providers respond to and manage their back pain. Future work should address the potential functional benefits of early identification of LPP and response to restorative treatment strategies."}]
