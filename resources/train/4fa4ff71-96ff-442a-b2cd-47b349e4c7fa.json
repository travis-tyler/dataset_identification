[{"section_title": "Background", "text": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered to be a symptomatic prodromal phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD) [1, 2] . Diagnostic criteria for MCI include objective evidence for cognitive impairment typically involving memory and subjective memory complaints, in the context of preserved functional abilities [3, 4] . However, MCI is a heterogeneous and complex clinical entity [5] . Some form of working memory (WM) and executive function (EF) impairment may be evident in MCI, not only in the nonamnestic form of the disorder, but also in the most common amnestic presentation [6] [7] [8] . These cognitive functions generally refer to \"high-level\" processes that coordinate cognitive, emotional, and behavioral functions to optimize performance in the pursuit of goals [9, 10] . Processes subserving these functions include planning and problem solving, set shifting, information updating, simultaneous storage and manipulation of information, and inhibition of prepotent responses, as well as more basic short-term maintenance of information [11] [12] [13] [14] .\nBased on behavioral data, simple WM maintenance functions are relatively better preserved with age than various control and information manipulation processes [15] , including planning and inhibition, although it remains possible that executive processes may compensate to some degree for subtle declines in the former [16] . These executive processes are more severely compromised in AD both at late and early stages [17] [18] [19] [20] , as well as \"late\" MCI [21, 22] . In addition, it has been proposed that episodic memory deficits contribute to the observed WM/EF deficits [23] .\nImportantly, while the typological differentiation of MCI allows for WM/EF impairment (as does AD), to date only limited numbers and types of WM/EF tests have been used to characterize these processes [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Moreover, characterization of WM/EF impairments has been limited by the use of composite scores including measures of general cognitive ability (memory, executive function, language, and visuospatial) that might obscure specific WM/EF impairments [29] . Recent research using cluster analytic techniques has demonstrated that individuals with MCI, a so-called \"dysexecutive\" MCI subtype was more severely impaired than the classical amnestic subtype and associated with greater longitudinal decline [25] . However, the restricted range of WM/EF tests in ADNI used in this study (i.e., confined to trail making part B) may not thoroughly capture the larger range of WM/EF processes.\nThe present study aimed to investigate the breadth and depth of WM/EF impairments in elderly healthy control individuals (EHCs), individuals with MCI, and individuals with AD. We hypothesized that WM/EF would be impaired in MCI and in AD. In this adequately powered study conducted with a reasonable range of WM/EF tests, our goals were to investigate 1) how pervasive, i.e., frequent, are WM/EF impairments in MCI (and AD); 2) how severe are these impairments; 3) the subdomains of WM/EF impairment; 4) relationships between WM/EF and everyday functional competence; and 5) brain morphometric predictors of WM/EF performance.

The cutoff for impairment was derived using z scores with mean and standard deviation of the EHC group for each test. A z score lower than -1 was considered impaired. Multiple comparisons were adjusted by Bonferroni correction (alpha of 0.05/12 tests, P 5 .004); this corrected level of statistical significance was applied for all the analysis described below. 2) To examine the breadth of WM/EF impairments within each individual we contrasted subjects in each group with 0-3 tests impaired and 4 or more tests impaired by chi square. 3) Depth (i.e., severity) of WM/EF impairments were assessed using general linear models (GLM) fitted to quantify differences between groups on each dependent variable (WM/EF tests) adjusted for post hoc comparisons using Bonferroni correction as indicated previously; effect sizes (ESs) were also computed using a correction approach [39] . 4) To ascertain subdomains of WM and EF impairment we used a factor analytic approach using data from all subjects. All cognitive measures were subjected to an exploratory factor analysis using maximum absolute correlation as prior communality estimates. Factors were extracted using the principal component method followed by a VARI-MAX (orthogonal) rotation. 5) The relationship between WM/EF with memory and everyday function were assessed through Spearman correlation coefficients adjusting alpha level for significance by Bonferroni correction; in these correlations, the factors derived from factorial analysis plus UPSA functional scale score were used. Finally, 6) stepwise regression models, based on maximizing R 2 , were fitted to analyze the contribution of the variation in cognitive/functional factors that might be attributed to brain morphometry in the whole sample. Brain morphometry variables were fitted as independent predictors (See Section 2.5 for list of predictors) into a series of separate models using each one of the cognitive/functional factors as dependent variables.\nTo manage missing data only for cognitive variables, a within-group multiple imputation was performed in SAS 9.4 (PROC MI) software for missing data [40] (see Supplementary Data)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The sociodemographic and clinical status characteristics for the three groups are presented in Table 1 .

"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study of WM/EF to date in MCI. It is also the largest non-ADNI study on WM/EF in MCI and it offers complementary findings that usefully extend and refine the heavily mined ADNI database. Tasks included 1) assays of simple WM storage that engages the phonological loop (digits forward and letter-number repetition); 2) more complex measures involving simultaneous storage and manipulation of information involving such processes as multiple sequencing of items, fully mentalized planning, and updating of information (digits backward, letter-number manipulation, N back task, Tower of London, and Stroop test); and 3) set shifting in the context of speed demands and organized visual search (TMT-A and TMT-B). Severity of impairment in the latter two types of task was in the medium and large range, respectively, in MCI by z score analyses and these differences were highly significant when contrasted with the EHC group. Moreover, the modal MCI subject demonstrated impairment on five measures, while the modal EHC demonstrated no impairments. This is one of the few studies to include such a variety of WM/EF tests within the same MCI sample.\nThe factor structure of the sample suggested three primary subdomains of WM/EF. Trail making tests (TMT A, B, and B-A) loaded on a single factor. As these tests are timed, when impaired in MCI and AD, they indicate slowed speed of processing. These tests also demand controlled visual search that in turn might modulate speed. What we have termed the executive subdomain comprised verbal and nonverbal tests that appear to reflect demands for processes that involve information manipulation of information maintained in storage, including multiple resequencing (of letters and numbers), updating (One-back), and mentalized planning and hypothesis testing (Tower test). A third factor involved short-term maintenance of information with reduced demand for manipulation. It may reflect the socalled phonological working memory loop and was found to be relatively preserved in MCI. The presence of another non-WM/EF factor comprised episodic memory tasks was not unexpected and provides a referent for the validity of our findings.\nAnother study examined executive function in MCI and identified two factors [41] : one consisted of tests that involved generating novel responses and problem solving and the other involved speed of processing and inhibition. In the ADNI database, Park and Manly [42] identified a speed/executive TMT factor and a digit span factors. Neither of these studies examined associations of factors to brain morphometry nor to functional competence, nor did they include the broad range of tests that we used.\nImpressively, the WM/EF measures were generally robust predictors of a validated performance-based measure of functional competence (the UPSA) in MCI and AD. In MCI, both working memory and cognitive control factors correlated significantly with the UPSA, while in AD speed of processing/visual search, executive function, and episodic memory, all had significant correlations with the UPSA. In the whole sample, the three WM/EF subdomains accounted for nearly 60% of the variance in functional competency assessed by the UPSA. This suggests that WM/EF processes are engaged by real-world scenarios, and if they are compromised, real world function will likely demonstrate compromises.\nWith respect to the relationships between the identified WM/EF factors and brain morphometry, we found that global cortical thickness was a significant predictor for working memory maintenance, cognitive speed and visual search, and executive function. In keeping with what is known about dedicated circuitry, we found that superior prefrontal cortex, a region that includes the supplemental and frontal eye fields, was a predictor of speed, perhaps related to dynamic visual search. Indeed, it is now generally appreciated that directed efficient visual search drives TMT speed (or lack thereof), not psychomotor speed per se [43] . Superior frontal cortex is also thought to be an important node in the dorsal attention network and supports selection of visual information and shifting between visual stimuli [44] .\nOur finding that the middle frontal gyrus was associated with the executive factor is consistent with multiple models of executive control and problem-solving [45] . In these models, executive tasks that demand more than simple storage are supported by dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex. To reinforce the validity of our approach, we found that episodic memory performance was predicted by hippocampal volume. The associations between WM/EF factors and cortical measures that we found may be placed in this context of prior findings in that more specific prefrontal morphometric reductions and more global gray matter reductions both play roles in impairment [46, 47] . We acknowledge that our sample does not have biological confirmation of AD pathology. However our design included a meticulous procedure to dissect clinical, cognitive, and functional profiles for each participant in consensus meetings with neurologists, neuropsychologists, and psychiatrists.\nOur findings suggest that white matter abnormalities may also contribute to WM/EF impairments. In particular, white matter volume reductions and signal abnormalities have been associated with frontal executive function and processing speed compromises in aging and AD [48, 49] . Moreover, mixed brain pathologies are frequently present in MCI and AD cases and have usually been found to be additive to AD histopathology in contributing to the clinical phenotype [50] . We found that white matter volume reductions subjacent to the anterior cingulate were associated with reductions in executive function. These may reflect white matter shrinkage that interrupts connectivity or loss of projection fibers from that area of cortex. Perhaps more strikingly, we found that white matter hypointensity volume reductions were associated with attenuations in executive function and speed as have others [48, 51] . Such imaging findings are usually thought to be part of spectrum of small vessel disease and have been identified using other imaging techniques (i.e., FLAIR and T2) and at postmortem. In T1-weighted imaging, T1-weighted hypointensities tend to follow a periventricular and deep white matter distribution [52] .\nIn summary, we found that WM/EF impairments are far from rare, that they are based on specific compromises to frontal cerebral circuitry, and that these WM/EF impairments are associated with loss of everyday functional abilities. The results that we report thus suggest that circuitrybased WM/EF impairments even at this potentially prodromal stage of AD have clinically deleterious consequences.
