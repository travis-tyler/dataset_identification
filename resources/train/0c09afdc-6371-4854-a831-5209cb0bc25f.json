[{"section_title": "Part of your focus addresses how women of colour working in STEM professions are viewed and treated. Why did you decide to look at this area specifically?", "text": "The whole point of What Works for Women at Work is to identify strategies women can use to navigate gender bias successfully. Organisations simply aren't changing fast enough and this is particularly true in science; women need success strategies and that was my focus. After around 70 interviews, I realised only 11 participants were women of colour. I am very interested in studying how the experience of gender bias differs by race."}, {"section_title": "Can you briefly describe the four patterns of gender bias?", "text": "We call the first pattern Prove-It-Again! When asked to think of a brilliant neuroscientist, most people think of a man. As such, women have to provide more evidence of competence than men in order to be seen as equally competent and prove themselves over and over. Under the second pattern, the Tightrope, women have to behave in masculine ways in order to be seen as competent. But at the same time, women are expected to be feminine. As women navigate this tightrope, they have to be attentive that they're not too feminine (lest they become liked but not respected), or too masculine (lest they become respected but not liked). These first two patterns both relate to the glassceiling effect, but the third pattern of bias -the Maternal Wall -is an order of magnitude larger than glass-ceiling patterns. The gender bias triggered by motherhood manifests itself in very strong negative competence and commitment assumptions, and also judgements about whether a woman is a good mother. The final pattern is Tug of War. In this case, gender bias against women turns into conflict among women. If women sense there is only room for one woman in a prized committee position, they tend to undercut each other. This was the least common form of bias reported among our interviewees."}, {"section_title": "What impact does the Maternal Wall pattern of bias have on working mothers in STEM careers?", "text": "The Maternal Wall is the confluence of my work with that of Professor Mary Ann Mason. Her research is based on the Survey of Doctorate Recipients, a nationally representative panel survey of PhDs in the US, and her insights into structural discrimination are very important. Professor Joan C Williams has been studying family and work issues for several decades. Her latest book, What Works for Women at Work, highlights unique strategies to help women overcome gender bias in the workplace Allowing women to flourish My book adds the everyday experience of being a scientist and a mother. After having children, women often feel they have to prove themselves all over again: they have to reprove their commitment to continuing their careers, reprove their competence. Also, one experimental study has shown that mothers who work very long hours are often disliked and held to even higher performance standards because they are seen as bad mothers and therefore bad people. We have robust evidence of this in our book."}, {"section_title": "Is a step change needed in the structuring of institutions to allow women to flourish?", "text": "The track record of organisational change in the past 25 years has been extremely dismal. We have not had effective models for organisational change, which is why I wrote this book: to give women successful strategies in the workplace while organisational change is still being carried out. Mason is concerned with models for organisational change. She developed the single best set of family-friendly policies for the University of California system, which is huge, and led to their system-wide implementation. This had dramatic results in terms of retaining women and improving conditions for fathers as well. We have a long way to go, and most certainly have our work cut out for us, but I am more motivated than ever to continue the fight and work to enact meaningful, measurable change. IN THE US, research has shown that gender bias still exists in the workplace, with women having to overcome many institutional barriers in order to get ahead. There are various points at which women with PhDs working in STEM disciplines can fall out of the career pipeline, such as motherhood. While single women tend to perform almost as well as married men in advancing their science careers, married mothers experience hurdles that prevent them from progressing along the track to tenure. In addition, recent research suggests that women of colour experience gender bias in the workplace even more acutely than white women."}, {"section_title": "GENDER AND RACE", "text": "At the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, Professor Joan C Williams researches experience in gender bias and the way this manifests itself in everyday interactions in the workplace. Her latest book -What Works for Women at Work -defines four distinct patterns of gender bias experienced by women working in STEM (and other) fields. While carrying out interviews, Williams soon realised that only a small portion of the survey participants were women of colour. A US National Science Foundation (NSF) grant enabled Williams to focus on how women of colour pursuing careers in science experience gender bias."}, {"section_title": "Tackling gender bias", "text": "Despite big steps forward since the 1970s, gender bias still exists in STEM workplaces. Recent studies by researchers at the University of California have shown that women of colour experience these problems even more acutely than white women Professor Mary Ann Mason is co-Principal Investigator on the Tools for Change project. She is the former Dean of Graduate Faculties at the University of California, Berkeley, and has conducted groundbreaking studies on the impact of motherhood on women in academia for more than a decade. Her research sets out to uncover why so few women who embark on tenure track jobs in STEM disciplines fail to make it into top academic posts such as full professors and deans. The answer is shockingly simple: these women are exposed to a 'baby penalty', which puts them at a distinct disadvantage to male colleagues. Co-authored with Nicholas H Wolfinger and Marc Goulden, Mason's book -Do Babies Matter? Gender and Family in the Ivory Tower (2013) -offers a comprehensive examination of the effects of family over the career span of academics. It draws on over a decade of research, using such unprecedented data resources as the Survey of Doctorate Recipients and multiple surveys of faculty and graduate students at the 10-campus University of California system. Individual chapters consider graduate school, how recent PhD recipients become academics, the tenure process and life after tenure. The authors explore the family sacrifices women often have to make to get ahead in academia and discuss how gender and family interact to affect promotion, salaries and retirement. Concrete strategies are suggested for transforming the university into a family-friendly environment at every career stage.  2013Koster believes the attrition of top talent from the STEM workforce is severely hampering the US's ability to lead in innovation and remain globally competitive in scientific disciplines. Despite the fact that women make up 51 per cent of the overall US workforce, they account for only 25 per cent of STEM workers. There are numerous factors behind the low retention rate, but Koster's research has shown that implicit bias plays an important role."}, {"section_title": "BOOKLIST", "text": "The Association for Women in Science has defined the following best practices: \u2022 Inoculate against implicit bias by discussing it or showing an informational video before convening recruitment, tenure and selection committees "}, {"section_title": "Do Babies Matter?", "text": "Although women receive more than 50 per cent of PhDs, there are far fewer women than men in top academic positions and those who do succeed are much less likely to have families.

"}, {"section_title": "DOUBLE JEOPARDY", "text": "In What Works for Women at Work, Williams dedicates an entire chapter -'Double Jeopardy' -to women of colour and their experiences of gender bias in STEM careers. While some black women interviewed by Williams said they felt being dominant at work helped them to tackle gender bias, others reported experiencing serious pushback for being overly assertive. Latinas also experienced gender bias acutely: \"I found Latinas in particular expected to carry large loads of 'office housework' (a 'liked but not respected' Tightrope pattern) with a particularly administrative flavour,\" explains Williams. \"Office housework was a common experience for all women, yet, although they were PhD scientists, some women of colour reported being expected to perform tasks typically carried out by an administrative assistant -keeping everyone organised, scheduling meetings -and that's not something I heard from white women.\" Asian-American women gave some particularly interesting responses: \"One scientist stated, 'I just make sure I am perceived as an Asian and not a woman,' because as an Asian she was seen as competent and as a woman she was seen as incompetent. These women also reported they were seen as too 'passive', another common Asian stereotype,\" elucidates Williams."}, {"section_title": "CONTINUING THE FIGHT", "text": "Women of colour reported more gender bias in all of the four patterns defined by Williams: \"93 per cent of white women reported gender bias, while 100 per cent of women of colour did! When we described the results of the experimental studies, one woman burst into tears,\" recalls Williams. Rather than trying to change STEM research institutions, Williams provides strategies that allow women to cope with their workplaces as they find them, although she remains hopeful of institutional change. Her work highlights the need for continued energy in combating gender bias in STEM fields and has shown how women of colour are at even greater risk than white women of encountering major hurdles when pursuing scientific careers.
