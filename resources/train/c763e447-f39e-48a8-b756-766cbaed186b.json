The S protein, which decorates the virion surface, also induces neutralizing antibodies and it is therefore the key target for vaccine development (Tang et al, 2020; Walls et al, 2020; Du et al, 2020) . In this context, it is of upmost importance to track the genetic diversity and evolution of circulating SARS-CoV-2 at regional and global levels, with special focus on detecting the emergence and monitoring the spread of S variants.\nAlthough surveillance has been expectedly focused on genetic changes affecting the S receptor binding domain (RBD) within S1 subunit, as they may directly affect the binding to ACE2 and ultimately SARS-CoV-2 host range and infectivity/transmissibility (Tang et al, 2020; Wu et al, 2020; Zhou et al, 2020; Andersen et al, 2020) , changes in other S protein domains should also be closely surveyed, particularly when they are linked to variant frequency increase at local, regional or global levels (Korber et al, 2020; Li et al, 2020) . A variant carrying the Spike D614G mutation (affecting the S2 subunit) stands out as a remarkable example, as it became dominant worldwide during the first months of the pandemic (Nextstrain; GISAID; Korber et al, 2020) with recent studies suggesting that the G614 variant might be linked to an increased transmissibility but not pathogenicity (Korber et al, 2020) . Spike amino acid 614 (within S2 subunit) is pocketed adjacent to the fusion peptide (FP), which is the functional fusogenic element of the S protein (Tang et al, 2020) , and near the expected cleavage site, suggesting that G614 might have induced a conformational change in the Spike protein influencing the dynamics of the spatially proximal fusion peptide, thereby resulting in the altered infectivity (Korber et al, 2020) . Hence, other mutations of interest outside the S protein RBD have been highlighted (Korber et al, 2020) , particularly those falling within the Spike FP (predicted region 816-855) or fusion peptide proximal regions (Korber et al, 2020; Tang et al, 2020) , due to the critical role of these motifs in inserting SARS-CoV-2 into the membrane of human cells (Tang et al, 2020; Cai et al, 2020) . The fusion mechanism (governed by Spike S2 subunit) is also pointed out as an important target for the development of specific drugs against coronavirus, since it is expectedly less mutable than the surface-exposed and immunogenic S1 RBD, which, from an evolutionary point-of-view, is not an ideal target for broad-spectrum antiviral inhibitor development (Xia et al, 2019; Tang et al, 2020) .\nIn the present study, we evaluated the temporal and geographical spread of a SARS-CoV-2 variant carrying the Spike protein amino acid change D839Y (within the fusion peptide) and show that this variant was introduced early in the epidemics in Portugal, becoming highly prevalent in the Northern and Central regions of Portugal (representing 22% and 59% of the sampled genomes until the end of April 2020, respectively). The emergence and high frequency of Spike Y839 variant (a descendent variant of the globally spread G614 variant) in SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Portugal, as well as the detection of the D839Y mutation in 12 additional countries (representing around 5% of sampled genomes in three countries), sustain that continuous molecular surveillance is pivotal to detect and monitor SARS-CoV-2 variants with biological/epidemiological relevance."}, {"section_title": "Introduction and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Y839 variant in Portugal", "text": "Acting as the National Reference Laboratory for SARS-CoV-2, the Portuguese National Institute of Health (INSA) Doutor Ricardo Jorge rapidly established the genome-based molecular surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in Portugal.

In total, the highly prevalent Spike Y839 variant was already detected in 44 municipalities across 11 out of the 18 Districts of Portugal mainland, consolidating that this descendent variant of the globally spread G614 variant had a remarkable weight in the early COVID-19 epidemic in Portugal."}, {"section_title": "Detection and circulation of SARS-CoV-2 Spike 839 amino acid variants worldwide", "text": "To explore the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 D839Y mutation (and other mutations in 839 protein position) at worldwide level, we downloaded 66548 amino acid sequences (and associated metadata) of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein available at GISAID (as of 23 July 2020). From the 65367 sequences collected outside Portugal having data for the 839 position, 97 were found to display mutations in this amino acid of interest (Table 1, Table S2 ). Of those, 92 genomes revealed the same genetic signature to that found in the 290 genomes from Portugal, i.e., a G-to-T nucleotide substitution in 24077 genome position (leading to the D839Y amino acid replacement) in a SARS-CoV-2 with Spike G614 background. As previously noticed (Korber et al, 2020) , this data sustains that the global frequency of amino acid variants in this 839 site remains around 0.5% (similar estimates can be found in https://cov.lanl.gov/content/index and https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov/). After the first Spike Y839 variant was detected in Italy (Lombardy) on February 21 st , the mutation D839Y has been reported in 12 other countries from four continents (Europe, Oceania, Asia and America) ( Figure 5 ). Despite the highly unequal sequencing \"sampling\" (i.e., proportion of confirmed cases with SARS-CoV-2 genome data) between the different countries, it is noteworthy that, apart from Portugal, D839Y genomes represent >5% of all sequences made available at GISAID (as of July 23 rd , 2020) by three countries (Estonia, (2) Table S1 (Portugal) and S2 (abroad). is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint\nThe copyright holder for this this version posted August 12, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.10.20171884 doi: medRxiv preprint Georgia and New Zealand) ( Figure 5 ). Of note, the four genomes detected in Iceland on early March are also associated with travel history to Italy (Gudbjartsson et al, 2020; Nextstrain) (Table S2) additional SNPs (including G24077T). In this particular case, we cannot exclude the hypothesis that the G24077T nucleotide change might have been introduced in a clade \"20C\" SARS-CoV-2 by r ecombination, as \"20C\" and \"20A harboring Y839\" viruses co-circulated in Wales during the collection period (13 out of the 51 Spike 839Y genomes from UK were collected in Wales between April 10 th and\nMay 25 th ). The potential third independent emergence of a Spike Y839 variant is supported by the four genomes collected in India, as they cluster apart from other G614+Y839 genomes, forming a subbranch (supported by 6 SNPs, including G24077T) within a large cluster mostly enrolling genomes Table S2 ). The bar graph in the upper right corner displays the proportion of D839Y sequences in the total number of Spike amino acid sequences available per country.

Hence, when a given variant raises in frequency in the population and/or is potentially linked to more severe disease, there is an expected interest in assessing whether such variant is associated with lower or higher Ct values than its ancestral, as a possible indicator that the emergent mutation might have mediated modified transmissibility, infectivity or disease severity. Still, for SARS-CoV-2, increasing reports have been linking the globally dispersed Spike G614 variant to lower Ct values (Korber et al, 2020; Lorenzo-Redondo et al, 2020; Wagner et al, 2020) , suggestive of higher upper respiratory tract viral loads leading to increased G614 transmissibility, but not pathogenicity (Korber et al, 2020) .\nAs the National Reference Laboratory, INSA could gather Ct values associated with 940 out of the 1516 genomes analyzed in present study. Despite the expected bias associated with sample collection (e.g., momentum), sampling (e.g., selection) and testing (e.g., extraction, PCR protocol and equipment) within datasets enrolling multiple laboratories, we sought to verify whether the same trend is observed for the D614/G614 comparison and whether the Spike Y839 variant (Spike background G614+Y839) may also be potentially linked with changes in Ct values (viral loads). As previously seen (Korber et al, 2020; Lorenzo-Redondo et al, 2020; Wagner et al, 2020) , we observed that infected individuals with Spike G614 had Ct values (mean=22.2; n=844) lower than those infected with D614 viruses (mean=22.9; n=96), still without statistical significance by Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test ( Figure   S4 ). Considering the phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 in Portugal, we then compared Ct values according to D614/G614 status, phylogenetic group within G614 (i.e., 20B or non-20B) and Spike D839/Y839 status ( Figure S4 ; https://microreact.org/project/nDGsJKFv7gQTj1q8CQwwKR/f46f1fa4). Curiously, Nextstrain \"20B\" clade (marked by the GGA-to-AAC SNP triplet at genome position 28881-3) revealed the lowest Ct values (mean=21.7; n=413) among all groups, although no statistical significance was observed in pairwise comparisons. Regarding the D839/Y839 comparison, we observed that Y839 variant presented non-significant higher Ct values (mean=22.7; n=220) than the ancestral D839 (mean=22.1; n=720). However, considering that D839 includes both 20B and non-20B samples, contrarily to Y839, which is a sub-group within 20A ( Figure S4 ), we repeated the analysis by excluding 20B samples from the comparison and observed similar average Ct values in D839 (mean = 22.6; n=624) and Y839 (mean = 22.7; n=220) groups. When applying the same rationale (i.e., excluding 20B) to the D614/G614 comparison, the 0.7 difference observed in the mean Ct values using whole dataset decreased to less than 0.3. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint\nThe copyright holder for this this version posted August 12, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.10.20171884 doi: medRxiv preprint"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "One of the main objectives of conducting genome-based surveillance of circulating pathogens is to identify mutations potentially leading to fitness advantages and/or immunological / drug resistance. For SARS-CoV-2, special focus has been given to identify and monitor mutations affecting antigenic and other host-interacting regions, as well as mutations potentially associated with frequency sweeps at local, regional or global levels (Nextstrain; GISAID; Korber et al, 2020) . In this perspective, mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike D839 site, which is predicted to fall within the Spike fusion peptide (Tang et al, 2020; Korber et al, 2020) , are of particular interest given both its nonnegligible relative frequency worldwide and the pivotal role of this protein motif in inserting SARS-CoV-2 into human cell membranes Tang et al, 2020; Korber et al, 2020) . In the present study, by tracking the temporal and geographical spread of a SARS-CoV-2 variant with a Spike D839Y amino acid change in Portugal, we show that this variant, which was likely originated from a single introduction from Italy in mid-late February 2020, was responsible for the largest SARS-CoV-2 transmission chain during the early epidemics, likely causing 24.8% (20.8-29.7%, CI 95%) COVID-19 cases in Portugal during the same period. Our data shows that it was circulating in Portugal before the first COVID-19 confirmed case was detected on March 2 nd , becoming notably prevalent in the Northern and Central regions of the country, representing 22% and 59% of the sampled genomes until the end of April 2020, respectively (Figures 2 and 3) . The Spike Y839 variant was introduced in the Northern region (the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic during the first two months), it was strongly linked to a massive cluster of cases in a coastal municipality (Ovar) from the Central region (the only municipality subjected to strict local quarantine) and progressively disseminated to inland locations of the Central region (Figure 2 , S1 and S3).\nTwo major explanations can be drawn to justify the high prevalence of the Spike Y839 variant in Portugal. On the one hand, its high prevalence might be due to a populational/epidemiological effect (founder effect) as this variant was likely one of the first SARS-CoV-2 lineages introduced in Portugal.\nIn this hypothesis, the increasing frequency trajectory of Spike Y839 variant would not have been mitigated because this variant disseminated well before the first confirmed cases in Portugal, when contact tracing, broad testing, and strict lockdown measures were still not in place. For example, on\nMarch 9 th , case definition for a COVID-19 suspected case did not include individuals with acute respiratory infection, unless they required hospitalization, reported travel history or any contact with suspected or confirmed cases in the 14 days before symptoms onset (https://www.dgs.pt/directrizesda-dgs/orientacoes-e-circulares-informativas/orientacao-n-002a2020-de-25012020-atualizada-a-250220201.aspx). On the other hand, the high prevalence could have been driven by fitness increase mediated by D839Y mutation. In this hypothesis, this mutation would have posed \"advantageous\" structural changes in the Spike protein with potential impact on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and consequently, on its transmissibility, as suggested for D614G (Korber et al, 2020) .

Also, a recent preprint report (not peer reviewed) using computational modelling suggested that mutations in Spike D839 [in particular, to an aromatic tyrosine (Y)] may strengthen the interaction between the virus and human T cells, potentially influencing host inflammatory responses (Cheng et al, 2020) . Although these clues about the potential functional effects of D839Y require more evidence through experimental validation, they clearly point out that a more in-depth study of the potential impact of this mutation of interest on SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility/pathogenicity should be conducted. In the same perspective, although we did not observe any association between Y839 and Ct values (viral load) in our dataset, this assessment needs to be revisited as more data is acquired. Notwithstanding, we indirectly observed that samples from the 20B clade (marked by the GGA-to-AAC SNP triplet at genome positions 28881-3) had a lower Ct than non-20B groups in our dataset, supporting that it is worth performing this comparison with additional datasets. Our observations sustain that it is challenging to discern the significance of particular mutations alone from population genetics, and that the evaluation of (sub)clade effects should not be neglected in this kind of screenings.\nIt is plausible that both hypotheses raised above (founder effect versus selective advantage) might have concomitantly contributed to the high frequency of the Spike D839Y mutation in Portugal.\nIts detection in 13 countries from four continents, its probable independent emergence in distinct times and genetic clades (20A and 20C) in some of these countries and its considerable relative weight (~5%) in the sampled genomes of three countries (besides Portugal) seem to favor the selective advantage hypothesis.

To explore the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 Spike D839Y variant at worldwide level, we downloaded 66548 amino acid sequences (and associated metadata) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein available at GISAID (as of 23 July 2020) and aligned them using MAFFT (Kaoth et al, 2002) .\nA total of 65367 sequences collected outside Portugal had sequence data for amino acid position 839, giving a total of 66883 (65367 plus 1516) sequences screened in this study for the presence of mutations in this amino acid of interest. The 92 genomes sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike D839Y variant detected abroad were downloaded from GISAD (GISAID acknowledgments are in Table S2 ).\nTheir clade classification and integration into \"global\" and Portugal phylogeny was performed using Nextstrain (https://nextstrain.org/ncov) and Nextclade (https://clades.nextstrain.org/)."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "In order to assess the temporal variation in the proportion of D839Y mutation among sequenced samples, a binomial regression model with logarithmic link function was applied. The model was then applied to extrapolate the evolution of Y839 cases in the total case population (data presented in Figure 4 ). To increase the robustness of the analysis, the studied timeframe (from March 14 th to April 9 th was adjusted to ensure 3-days bins with at least 25 genome sequences. This period overlaps the exponential phase of the epidemic in Portugal. We assumed one day as the timeframe delay between sample collection and case notification. The Kruskal-Walls non-parametric test was used to assess the existence of statistically significant differences in Ct values between groups ( Figure   S4 ). Differences in Ct values for each pair of groups were assessed using the Wilcoxon test adjusted for multiple comparison tests."}, {"section_title": "Data availability", "text": "SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences generated in this study were uploaded to GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org/).

The graph shows the temporal distribution (by date of sample collection of the first case of the epicluster; black lines) of 41 potential \"epiclusters\" (covering a total of 420 confirmed cases) for which SARS-CoV-2 genome data is already available. 33 epiclusters (323 confirmed cases) (77%) are exclusively associated with the Spike Y839 variant. The two potential epiclusters where both D839 and Y839 variants were ambiguously detected are under close contact tracing investigation to disclose this incongruence. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint\nThe copyright holder for this this version posted August 12, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.10.20171884 doi: medRxiv preprint Figure S3 .
