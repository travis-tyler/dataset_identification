[{"section_title": "", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an unacceptable problem. It takes a catastrophic toll on patients and family caregivers, and it is projected to have a financially overwhelming effect around the world in our children's lifetime. In our opinion, the great est roadblock in the scientific fight against AD is not necessarily the discovery of new treatments, but the means to evaluate them presymptomati cally, when they may have their greatest impact, in a sufficiently rapid and rigorous way. It cur rently takes too many cognitively normal research subjects, too many years and too much money to evaluate more than a few presymptomatic AD treatments using clinical end points. Brain imag ing and other biomarkers of AD progression and pathology have the potential to accelerate the evaluation of presymptomatic AD treatments. However, regulatory agencies are unlikely to pro vide accelerated approval for a presymptomatic AD treatment based solely on biomarker end points, without additional evidence from rando mized clinical trials (RCTs) to conclude that a treatment's biomarker effects are reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit. In the mean time, sponsors are reluctant to conduct presymp tomatic AD trials without a regulatory approval pathway. This dilemma may at first seem like an insurmountable 'catch22', leading to a sense of nihilism and a lack of urgency, but inaction is not an option. Given both the extraordinary stakes and opportunity now at hand, we are convinced that now is the time to launch the public policy and scientific initiatives needed to accelerate the evaluation of presymptomatic AD treatments."}, {"section_title": "Anticipating the presymptomatic treatment & diagnosis of AD", "text": "To begin, we define 'presymptomatic AD treat ments' as \"those interventions that are initiated before apparent cognitive decline and intended to reduce the chance of developing ADrelated symptoms.\" The term is introduced for two reasons:\nTo help address uncertainties related to the use of the terms primary versus secondary preven tion, including their relationship to presymp tomatic or symptomatic evidence of AD at the time a treatment is started; We anticipate that regulatory agencies will find it easier to consider a 'presymptomatic AD treatment' indication than an 'AD prevention' indication (at least until there is compelling evidence that a treatment can avert sympto matic AD throughout a person's lifetime). The proposed term would be used whether a pre symptomatic treatment is started before or after biological evidence of the underlying disease (which may be hard to define), and whether it postpones the onset, partially reduces the risk of or completely prevents symptomatic AD.\nNow is the time to launch the era of Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevention research, establish the methods and infrastructure to rapidly evaluate presymptomatic AD treatments and evaluate them rigorously and rapidly in randomized clinical trials. This article is a call to arms. It contends that the evaluation of presymptomatic AD treatments must become an urgent priority, it identifies what is holding us back and proposes new public policies and scientific strategies to overcome these roadblocks. It defines the term 'presymptomatic AD treatment,' notes the best established biomarkers of AD progression and pathology and suggests how they could be used to rapidly evaluate presymptomatic AD treatments in the people at risk. It introduces an approach to evaluate presymptomatic AD treatments in asymptomatic people at the highest risk of imminent clinical onset and determines the extent to which the treatment's biomarker predicts a clinical outcome. We propose an Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative, which is now being reviewed and refined in partnership with leading academic and industry investigators. It is intended to evaluate the most promising presymptomatic AD treatments, help develop a regulatory pathway for their accelerated approval using reasonably likely surrogate end points and find demonstrably effective presymptomatic AD treatments as quickly as possible.\nWe further divide these presymptomatic AD treatments into those that exert their beneficial effects by compensating for the underlying dis ease and those that exert their beneficial effects by directly or indirectly reversing or slowing down the progression of the underlying disease. We anticipate the eventual need to specify whether a presymptomatic AD treatment is initiated before or after presymptomatic biomarker evidence of disease, since this subclassification may predict a differential response to treatment and it may or may not require the treatment to be associated with an accompaning diagnostic test. Although the diagnosis of AD currently requires sympto matic evidence of the disease, the concept of a presymptomatic ADmodifying treatment antici pates the time when AD is defined on the basis of biological criteria, and related to the presympto matic and progressively symptomatic stages of the disorder.\nWhile we would recommend using the term 'presymptomatic AD trial' in place of 'AD preven tion trial' in professional communications, the latter term may be more readily understood by the general public. It underscores the ultimate goal in the scientific fight against AD and it does not dismiss the possibility that some of the treatments now in development might have the chance to prevent symptomatic AD completely. For instance, if the amyloidb (Ab) peptide plays a critical role in the final common pathway associ ated with the predisposition to AD, and if a treat ment now in development targets the right form of Ab and is started sufficiently early, it may be possible to prevent symptomatic AD completely. For these reasons, we use the term 'Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative' to describe the scientific strategy and public policies described below, and which continues to be refined in partnership with leading academic and industry investigators and other stakeholders."}, {"section_title": "Presymptomatic AD trials: why now?", "text": "There are several compelling reasons to acceler ate the evaluation of presymptomatic AD treat ments starting now, as described in the following sections. n Demonstrably effective presymptomatic AD treatments are urgently needed to avert an overwhelming crisis Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of disabling cognitive impairment in older people, afflicting approximately one tenth of people older than 65 years of age and almost half of those older than 85 [1] . With the skyrocketing number of people living to older ages, the financial toll of AD is projected to become overwhelming by the time today's young adults become senior citizens [2, 3] . According to a recent report [101] , more than 35 million people are afflicted by AD and other dementias; this number is estimated to nearly double every 20 years, to more than 65 million in 2030 and more than 115 million in 2050, and there are likely to be an even greater number of people in the earlier symptomatic stages of AD. n Promising treatments to reduce the risk of symptomatic AD are ready to be evaluated in RCTs With the quickening pace of scientific discoveries, researchers continue to add to the list of currently available, sufficiently safe and welltolerated interventions, suggested but not yet proven to postpone the onset and reduce the risk of symp tomatic AD. Interventions proposed to reduce the risk of symptomatic AD include a variety of cur rently available healthy lifestyle [4, 5] and dietary interventions [6] , medications approved for other indications [7] [8] [9] and dietary supplements [10] . A treatment that delayed the onset of symptomatic AD by only 5 years without increasing longevity would potentially reduce the number of patients by half [2] , illustrating the impact that a sympto matic ADpostponing treatment could have on this rapidly growing public health problem. n A rapidly growing number of investigational AD-modifying treatments are now being studied in symptomatic AD RCTs The list includes numerous Abmodifying med ication and immunization treatments, a much smaller number of taumodifying and micro tubulestabilizing treatments, and treatments suggested to target other elements of the postu lated pathogenic cascade [11] . If any one of these treatments is targeting critical pathogenic events, is sufficiently safe and well tolerated, and is intro duced early enough, it could have an enormous public health benefit. There will soon be enough safety and tolerability data to permit the evalua tion of some of these treatments in asymptomatic people at increased risk for symptomatic AD. neurofibrillary neuropathology. There is a com pelling reason to evaluate promising treatments presymptomatically, whether or not they signifi cantly slow down the clinical course in symptom atic patients, as long as the treatment is consid ered sufficiently safe and well tolerated. While there is a growing concern that investigational ADmodifying treatments now in RCTs may offer too little help too late to exert a profound effect even in patients in the mildest symptomatic stages of AD, we and others hold onto the hope that symptomatic AD patients may still have at least some therapeutic response to these treatments, we postulate that symptomatic AD patients may ben efit from a combination of treatments that target early and late stages of the disease (e.g., a combi nation of Ab and taumodifying therapies), and we wish to emphasize the importance of doing everything in our power to address the needs of our symptomatic AD patients and families. To be clear, the accelerated evaluation of presymptom atic AD patients should not come at the expense of our patients. n Investigational treatments may not be ready for evaluation in most cognitively normal people until more safety & tolerability data are acquired in clinically affected patients, they may be ready sooner in those who for genetic or other reasons are at the highest imminent risk of symptomatic AD Cognitively normal people at unusually high imminent risk of symptomatic AD include car riers of relatively rare earlyonset ADcausing PS1 [12] , PS2 [13] and APP [14] mutations close to their family's estimated median age at clinical onset, people with two copies of the APOE e4 allele, a lateonset AD susceptibility gene [15] , close to their estimated median age at clinical onset and, according to initial studies, older people with a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) bio marker profile characterized by high total (t) or phospho (p)tau and low Ab 42 levels [16, 17] . n Researchers have developed several promising imaging & CSF biomarkers to detect or track the brain changes associated with the predisposition to AD While researchers continue to investigate a number of different brain imaging, biological fluid and other biomarker measurements for use in the early detection and tracking of AD (see references [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] , for example), to date the best established biomarkers of AD progression and pathology include reduced fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET measurements of the cerebral meta bolic rate for glucose (CMRgl) in brain regions preferentially affected by AD ( Figure 1A ) [23] [24] [25] ; structural MRI measurements of brain shrinkage (i.e., hippocampal, entorhinal cortex and whole brain volume loss, ventricular enlargement and gray matter loss and cortical thinning in regions preferentially affected by AD ( Figure 1B) ) [26] [27] [28] ; PET measurements of fibrillar Ab burden (using 11 Clabeled Pittsburgh CompoundB ( Figure 1C ) or 11 C or 18 Flabeled ligands now in develop ment) [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] and certain CSF analytes (i.e., low CSF Ab 42 levels, high t or ptau levels, or a combination of low Ab 42 and high ttau or ptau levels) [16, 17, 38, 39] .\nSeveral of these imaging and CSF biomarkers have shown value in the presymptomatic detec tion and tracking of AD. For instance, we and our colleagues have used imaging techniques in cognitively normal initially latemiddleaged APOE e4 homozygotes, heterozygotes and non carriers to detect or track CMRgl reductions These studies suggest how the imaging tech niques could be used to evaluate presymptom atic AD treatments in a few hundred cognitively normal latemiddleaged APOE e4 homozygotes or heterozygotes in 2year proofofconcept RCTs [26, 27, 31, [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] and complement the work of other researchers [30, [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] . Researchers have also used imaging techniques to show CMRgl declines, whole brain shrinkage and increased fibrillar Ab burden in cognitively normal carriers of early onset ADcausing mutations ( Figure 5 ) [35, [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] ], and to demonstrate that fibrillar Ab burden in cognitively normal older adults is associated with subsequent rates of progression to symptomatic AD [34] . Moreover, they have reported low Ab 42 levels and high ttau and ptau levels in cogni tively normal APOE e4 carriers [72, 73] , and that the combination of high ttau or ptau levels and low Ab 42 levels predicts subsequent rates of pro gression from cognitive normality to the early symptomatic stages of AD [16, 17, 74] . These pre symptomatic AD biomarkers could be used to rapidly evaluate presymptomatic AD treatments in APOE e4 carriers, earlyonset ADcausing mutation carriers or research participants with presymptomatic biomarker evidence of AD in proofofconcept RCTs."}, {"section_title": "what is holding us back?", "text": "Despite the urgent need to evaluate promising presymptomatic treatments for AD and the n It takes too many people, too much money & too many years to conduct adequately powered presymptomatic AD RCTs using clinical end points As noted previously, it takes too many cognitively normal people and too much time to find demon strably effective presymptomatic AD treatments using clinical end points, such that enough people develop the clinical end points needed to distin guish between active treatment and placebo groups with adequate statistical power. Although a small number of presymptomatic AD RCTs have been performed [75] [76] [77] [78] , they have required thousands of subjects, many years of treatment and restriction of the sample to older adults in order to achieve sufficient statistical power. If we continue to rely on the use of clinical end points in presymptom atic AD RCTs, we will not be able to evaluate the range of promising presymptomatic treatments or those treatments started in middle age, when several treatments (e.g., hormonereplacement, cholesterollowering and blood pressurelowering therapies) have been postulated to have their most significant therapeutic effects. Pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies are reluctant to sponsor prevention trials that take longer than their duration of marketing exclusivity, and the government may be reluctant to support many presymptomatic AD trials at the same time, given their extraordinary expense. Therefore, given the n Regulatory agencies will not approve a presymptomatic AD treatment based solely on biomarker end points Brain imaging and CSF biomarker methods could be used in APOE e4 carriers and other atrisk subjects to evaluate presymptomatic AD treatments in RCTs. Still, these studies will not provide a sufficient path for the accelerated regu latory agency approval of presymptomatic treat ments until RCTs provide sufficient evidence to conclude that a treatment's effect on these bio marker end points is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit [26, 79, 80] . In the next section, we propose a strategy to address this critical need. For now, some humility is needed when it comes to a reliance on these biomarkers in RCTs. It is not yet known how much a given biomarker will budge in response to different treatments. Similarly, it is not known whether the treatment might have a confounding effect on the biomarker unrelated to AD progression (e.g., a change in brain swelling, synaptic activity, glucose metabo lism or arborization or analyte turnover), as illus trated in the RCT of the first active Ab immuniza tion therapy [81] . Finally, researchers still do not know the extent to which the biomarker effects of different ADmodifying treatments, alone or in combination, will predict a clinical benefit. While the only way to answer these questions is to characterize and compare each of the promising biomarkers in clinical trials, this surrogate marker development effort introduces significant cost and complexity, and it is typically not the primary focus of sponsors seeking to evaluate a particular drug product in the most costeffective way. n We currently lack the public policies needed to accelerate the evaluation of presymptomatic AD treatments As previously noted, there has been little finan cial incentive for companies to conduct time consuming and expensive presymptomatic AD RCTs; there has been little financial incentive to investigate offpatent treatments, including health promoting lifestyle interventions, and there has been little shortterm financial incentive to include multiple expensive brain imaging and other bio marker measurements in RCTs to help determine which biomarker is mostly likely to predict a treat ment's therapeutic effect. It is time to make this effort an urgent priority. Given the stakes, it is time for federal governments to play a leadership role in this critically important endeavor.\nThe Alzheimer's Study Group Adapted with permission from [40] .\nwww.futuremedicine.com\nAlzheimer's Prevention Initiative, which con sists of new scientific strategies, public policies and the sense of urgency needed to launch an era of AD prevention research and find demon strably effective presymptomatic AD treatments as soon as possible [26] . In our opinion, it is not only important to launch an initiative like this, but to do so in a way that maximizes the chance for success. This will entail extensive collabora tion with scientific, industry and public partners, capitalizing on the successes and lessons of other collaborative efforts such as the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS), Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network (DIAN). Success will be measured, to some degree, by the extent to which a new initia tive such as this can leverage and complement the goals and aims of other related programs, as well as the strengths of individual investigators and advisors. Transparency and accountability will be critical, along with the imperative to assure that the many ethical issues that will arise are handled as thoughtfully as possible."}, {"section_title": "A new scientific paradigm", "text": "Despite the roadblocks discussed previously, we remain optimistic regarding the ability to evaluate presymptomatic AD treatments. These suggestions are discussed in the following sections. Board (DSMB) found no promising biomarker or clinical effects during the course of the study (i.e., no evidence that the active treatment was associated with the predicted effects on measure ments of Ab or tau pathology, regional CMRgl decline, brain shrinkage, longterm memory or clinical ratings), it could declare futility, thereby giving those people at the highest imminent risk for symptomatic AD access to other investiga tional treatments in presymptomatic therapeu tic trials while conserving precious resources. If instead, the DSMB found promising biomarker or clinical effects, the study would continue using biomarker, cognitive and clinical end points. This presymptomatic AD treatment trial/sur rogate marker development paradigm would make it possible to evaluate investigational presymp tomatic treatments trials sooner than otherwise possible (i.e., with safety and tolerability data from fewer patients), since it would provide the data needed to show the extent to which an estab lished treatment's effects on different biomarkers predicts a clinical benefit.
