Recent research shows that during every year of schooling, African American students continue to learn less than comparable White students (Jacobson et al., 2001; Phillips, Crouse, & Ralph, 1998) . Whereas African American children begin elementary school approximately 1 year behind Whites in vocabulary knowledge, they finish high school approximately 4 years behind Whites (Jacobson et al., 2001; Phillips, Crouse, et al., 1998) . Of course, learning requires prior skills, engagement, and opportunities to learn, and at each grade level, African Americans are disadvantaged (S\u00f8rensen & Hallinan, 1977) . They enter with lower academic skills compared to White students (Jacobson et al., 2001; Phillips, Brooks-Gunn, Duncan, Klebanov, & Crane, 1998) and generally occupy lower curricular tracks and take less demanding coursework compared to White students (Gamoran & Mare, 1989; Jones, Vanfossen, & Ensminger, 1995; Lucas, 1999; Mickelson, 2001) . Moreover, teachers rate them as less attached and engaged in their schoolwork compared to White students (Ainsworth-Darnell & Downey, 1998; Farkas, 1996) . Despite modest declines in Black-White residential segregation, African American students continue to be concentrated in racially segregated public schools within urban districts. And a growing body of research has found lower achievement gains in urban schools and schools where a higher percentage of the student body is African American (Bankston & Caldas, 1996; Entwisle & Alexander, 1992; Roscigno, 1998) .\nTo better understand the sources of the racial gap in educational performance and achievement, it is important to examine not only how African American and White students differ with respect to the overall learning process but also how these students interact with and are shaped by the larger organizational context and social environment of the school. Therefore, this study explicitly models the relationship among the three variables-opportunities to learn, academic engagement, and achievement-as the student's career evolves over time in either a Low or High Minority school. In addition, unlike prior studies that have examined the main effect of school characteristics on student learning, this study focuses on whether the influence of a student's race on the learning process actually varies by the characteristics of the schools the student attends-in particular, racial composition and school location. Specifically, this study addresses the following questions. First, what are the magnitudes of the effect of learning opportunities, academic engagement, and academic achievement on itself and the other two outcomes over time? Second, how do the relative magnitudes differ between Low and High Minority schools? Third, how much of the racial achievement gap is accounted for by these effects and their differential patterns and magnitudes across Low and High Minority schools?"}, {"section_title": "Lleras", "text": "Finally, does the learning process in Low and High Minority schools differ by school location (i.e., urban, suburban, rural) , and do any such differences help explain the racial gap in academic achievement?\n\n\nIn the slopes-as-outcomes HLM model, student-level outcomes are a function of the overall intercept: the main student-level predictors and the cross-level interactions between the student predictors and school characteristics. This model estimates the effect of race and other student-level predictors on the within-school differences in the outcomes, as well as the influence of the school-level characteristics on the relationship between race, the endogenous student predictors, and the student-level outcomes. The Level 1 or student-level model estimates the variance of the outcome that can be attributed to differences among students within schools, without regard to differences between schools, is in the following form:\nThe Level 2 or school-level model takes the following form:\nAll the models include controls for sex and family background, as well as the effects of the cross-level interactions between student-level predictors and all other school characteristics.\nTo ease the interpretation and presentation of the results, the endogenous student-level predictors in the models (i.e., student effort, math courses, math achievement) have been centered on their group means and allowed to vary nonrandomly as a function of the school-level predictors in the model. The intercept in each model represents the mean outcome for a White student in school j, adjusted for the mean of all the predictor variables. The Black coefficient represents the average racial gap or difference in the outcome for Black relative to White students. The other student-level predictors represent the average effect on the outcome across all schools. The school-level coefficients represent the effect of the school characteristics on the slopes of the student predictors.\nI begin by estimating an ordinal logistic model, regressing mathematics course taken in 8th grade on student's race. Next, I regressed students' academic engagement in 8th grade on race and 8th-grade math class. Finally, 8th-grade math class and academic engagement are added sequentially into models predicting the mathematics test score at the end of 8th grade. The majority of the analyses focus on the 10th-grade outcomes, estimating separate models for students attending Low and High Minority schools. I begin by estimating an ordinal logistic model using race, math class, student engagement, and mathematics test score in the 8th grade, as well as several schoollevel characteristics, to predict the student's math course sequence in the first 2 years of high school. Next, I regress 10th-grade student engagement on race,\n\nModel 3 presents the analysis of 10th-grade mathematics achievement. On average, the students in Low Minority schools have much higher academic achievement compared to students in High Minority schools. There are no significant effects of school location on average math achievement scores in Low Minority schools. However, mean math achievement is significantly lower in High Minority urban schools, even after controlling for prior math achievement, math course sequence, and academic engagement. As in the analysis of 8th-grade math achievement, African American students in High Minority urban schools have much lower achievement compared to African American students in Low Minority urban schools (more than 11 standard deviations). While the urban coefficient is not significant, the size and direction again suggests that students in predominantly Black, urban schools are particularly disadvantaged. In the average urban High Minority high school, African American students scored 2.097 points behind their White classmates. The Black-White achievement gap in the average suburban High Minority high school was only .260 points. By contrast, in Low Minority high schools, the Black-White gap continues to be significant in suburban high schools, even after controlling for prior achievement, engagement, and math course taking. In the average suburban Low Minority high school, African American students are 1.729 points behind their White classmates.\nThe causally prior endogenous variables are significant and in expected directions. That is, prior math class, academic engagement, and math achievement are all positively related to math achievement (except for the effect of engagement on achievement in High Minority schools). In looking at the effects of prior math achievement, the results again show that school location makes a difference. In urban and rural High Minority schools, the stability of math achievement over time is much lower, on average, compared to students attending suburban High Minority schools. This suggests that the average gains in mathematics made by students in urban and rural High Minority Lleras schools were significantly lower than those made by students in suburban High Minority schools. In looking at the effects of math course sequence on mathematics gains over the 2-year period, again there are significant differentiating effects by school location. In High Minority schools, the academic pay-off for taking higher level math classes is substantially greater if students are in urban or rural schools. Conversely, students who do not take more challenging math courses are particularly disadvantaged in terms of math achievement if they are in these kinds of schools. Again, the same pattern is true in Low Minority schools, but the effects are not nearly as large and striking as in High Minority schools. This supports Kerckhoff and Glennie's (1999) statement of the \"Matthew effect\" in schooling: As students progress through the grade levels, \"the rich get richer and the poor get poorer\" so that placement and performance gaps tend to increase. However, even with controls for prior achievement, math course-taking in 9th and 10th grades, and current engagement, the Black-White mathematics achievement gap is widening between 8th and 10th grades, particularly in High Minority urban schools (see Figure 1 ). Figure 1 shows the predicted achievement gaps between African American and White students between 8th and 10th grades, calculated from the predicted values in Model 3 of Table 3 (base and base + urban coefficients). The predicted gaps include controls for 8th-grade math achievement test score, 10th-grade engagement, math course sequence in 9th and 10th grades, family background, and other school characteristics."}, {"section_title": "Opportunities to Learn and Student Achievement", "text": "A great many empirical studies have examined the determinants and consequences of curriculum track placement in American schools. The results suggest that placement in higher tracks compared to lower tracks leads to greater achievement gains (Gamoran, 1992; Gamoran & Mare, 1989; Hallinan, 1987; Lucas & Gamoran, 2002; Oakes, Gamoran, & Page, 1992; Pallas, Entwisle, Alexander, & Stluka, 1994; Rosenbaum, 1980; Stevenson, Schiller, & Schneider, 1994) . The positive relationship between advanced coursework and academic achievement is typically attributed to more material being covered, at a more advanced level, and with higher instructional quality and higher teacher expectations in higher track courses (Alexander & Cook, 1982; Friedkin & Thomas, 1997; Gamoran, 1989 Gamoran, , 1992 Gamoran & Mare, 1989; Hallinan & Kubitschek, 1999; Lucas, 1999; Oakes, 1985) . Furthermore, placement in more advanced coursework results in more positive school-related attitudes, fewer behavioral problems, and higher educational expectations, even after controls for prior achievement and educational plans (Berends, 1994; Rosenbaum, 1980; Vanfossen, Jones, & Spade, 1987) .\nRegarding racial differences in track placement, the evidence is less clear. Overall, African American students are enrolled in fewer advanced courses than White students are. However, early national and regional studies, relying on student self-reports, found that, net of socioeconomic background and prior achievement, African American students were more likely than White students to be in college-preparatory programs in high school (Alexander & Cook, 1982; Alexander, Cook, & McDill, 1978; Gamoran & Mare, 1989; Rosenbaum, 1980) . Later researchers, using course-based tracking indicators from transcript data to construct track location, found that, net of social class background and prior performance, there are essentially no differences in the probability of academic track placement between African American and White students (Kelly, 2004; Lucas & Gamoran, 2002) .\nAs the tracking literature has become more sophisticated, a sharper focus on specific subjects (such as mathematics) and enrollment in specific course titles (e.g., Algebra I) and course sequences (e.g., Algebra I, followed by Algebra II) have emerged. This is partly due to the fact that high schools vary not only in the number but also in the kind of curriculum tracks they use, including the coursework offered to students within particular tracks and the amount of mobility or course taking allowed in classes across tracks (Garet & DeLany, 1988; Hallinan & Kubitschek, 1999; Lucas, 1999; Stevenson et al., 1994) . Similar to the findings regarding track location and achievement, research shows that enrollment in more academic and challenging coursework has a significant impact on achievement, regardless of parental education and income, prior grades, and test scores Educational Inequality in Urban and Suburban Schools (Gamoran, 1987; Gamoran & Mare, 1989; Hallinan, 1987; Jencks & Phillips, 1999; Pallas et al., 1994; Vanfossen et al., 1987) .\nResearch also suggests that a student's learning opportunities at one point in time strongly determines future opportunities to learn either directly or indirectly. For example, enrollment in a particular course may directly impact future course taking if the class is a prerequisite for taking future classes (Stevenson et al., 1994) . Current classes may also influence future course-taking patterns since students experiencing better learning opportunities typically learn more and thus secure a positional advantage over other students with poorer or fewer opportunities to learn. Indeed, prior coursework and achievement test scores, particularly in mathematics and English, are strongly related to track placement and course-taking patterns during high school (Gamoran, 1992; Gamoran & Mare, 1989; Hallinan, 1991; Lucas, 1999; Oakes, 1985; Rosenbaum, 1980; Stevenson et al., 1994) . If African American students are more likely to be enrolled in lower math classes during middle school, they could have fewer opportunities to take more advanced math classes directly or indirectly by influencing their skills and knowledge of math prior to entering high school."}, {"section_title": "Student Engagement, Opportunities to Learn, and Achievement", "text": "Learning requires not only the opportunity to learn but also student effort and engagement with the course material. Surprisingly, this has been somewhat neglected in recent studies of tracking and achievement (Carbonaro, 2005) . Thus, a principal contribution of the current study is to examine the role of school engagement, alongside course-taking patterns, in the determination of achievement for African American and White students in different school contexts.\nStudent effort may exert both direct and indirect effects on achievement. Students who try hard in school are likely to be rewarded with both increased achievement and higher curriculum placement. Empirical evidence shows that students who are more attentive in class, spend more time on and complete homework, and avoid disruptive behaviors have higher cognitive gains (Ainsworth-Darnell & Downey, 1998; Farkas, 1996; Farkas, Grove, Sheehan, & Shaun, 1990) and greater educational attainment (Rosenbaum, 2001; Lleras, 2008) . Student effort also typically increases the student's learning opportunities. This is because teacher judgments and course grades are based on effort and behavior as well as performance, and teachers use all of these to judge students and assign them to curricular tracks (Farkas, 1996; Farkas et al., 1990; Hallinan, 1996; Rosenbaum, 2001) . Student effort may also depend on whether the student has acquired the prior skills and knowledge needed to engage effectively in the material presented in the class. In other words, students who do not have the ability to do the work may not exert as much effort, particularly if they feel they are too far behind to catch up."}, {"section_title": "School Characteristics and the Learning Process", "text": "Research shows that track placement may depend on school as well as individual student characteristics (Alexander & McDill, 1976; Gamoran, 1987) . Thus, school racial composition, as well as geographic location, may influence learning outcomes in at least two ways: (a) via their impact on normative processes, teacher-student relations, and peer interactions; and (b) by influencing the overall organizational structure within the school that in turn affects the level and distribution of student learning opportunities. African American students in predominantly Black schools may be exposed to and experience a less demanding curriculum, both in advanced and general classes as a result of lower teacher quality and expectations, and reduced access to more academic coursework compared to students in predominantly White schools. Additionally, there is some evidence that teachers in predominantly White schools teach at a higher level compared to teachers in minority schools (Dreeben & Gamoran, 1986; Mahard & Crain, 1983) . Clearly, one reason this might be the case is that teachers often teach to the average level of students' ability in their classrooms. Since the class average is likely to be higher in predominantly White schools (Bankston & Caldas, 1996; Roscigno, 1998) , African American students may benefit more from taking more advanced classes in those schools compared to minority schools (Mahard & Crain, 1983) . On the other hand, African American students may have an increased chance of enrollment in the more advanced classes offered in minority schools, due to lower discrimination by teachers and reduced competition from other students.\nHowever, few studies have tested whether a student's race interacts with school characteristics to determine the student's track location or course-taking patterns in high school. Rather, studies that have considered racial composition and other school characteristics have typically included these characteristics as main effects in models predicting track assignment, controlling for student characteristics (Gamoran & Mare, 1989; Kilgore, 1991) . Only a few researchers have included the percentage of Black students in the school as a main effect predicting track enrollment, controlling for students' race and ethnicity, student achievement, and social background (Gamoran & Mare, 1989; Lucas & Gamoran, 2002; Mickelson, 2001) . Of these studies using nationally representative samples, researchers have generally found that as the proportion of Black students in high school increases, so does the likelihood that students will be placed in higher tracks, regardless of race and whether student self-report or transcript data are used to construct track location (Gamoran & Mare, 1989; Lucas & Gamoran, 2002) .\nIn one of the few empirical studies to examine the interaction between a student's race and the racial composition of the school in determining academic track, Kelly (2004) finds similar results. Using data from the transcript survey in the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS), Kelly (2004) shows that African American students are equally likely to take more advanced math coursework during the first 2 years of high school compared"}, {"section_title": "Educational Inequality in Urban and Suburban Schools", "text": "to White students, controlling for prior math grades and math test scores (8th grade). However, once an interaction term between the percentage of African American students in the high school and race is added to the model, the Black student coefficient becomes negative and statistically significant. These results suggest that African American students who attend predominantly White schools are less likely to be enrolled in higher math course sequences compared to similar Whites in the same kind of school.\nIn a recent study using internal data from the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School District, Mickelson (2001) reaches a different conclusion. She argues that racial segregation operates via a variety of mechanisms to offer African American students in racially isolated schools fewer opportunities to learn. These include the assignment of less credentialed and experienced teachers and students to lower track courses in predominantly Black schools. One of Mickelson's key findings is that students who attended racially isolated elementary schools are more likely when they are in higher grades to be enrolled in lower track courses and to show lower school achievement. These findings are consistent with other research we have reviewed: Students that fall behind early tend to fall further behind in later grade levels. These findings also highlight the role of school racial composition and curriculum placement in determining students' educational achievement.\nOver the past few decades, the U.S. population has also become more concentrated in suburban areas. Although racial and ethnic minorities continue to be underrepresented in the suburbs, the share of minorities among suburban populations has been increasing rapidly. As a result, the numbers of Black children attending middle-class suburban schools is also rising (Farley & Frey, 1994; Reardon & Yun, 2001 ). However, recent empirical evidence shows that racial segregation and increasing poverty have often accompanied minority suburbanization (Reardon & Yun, 2001) . Thus, despite declines in Black-White residential segregation and an increase in the proportion of African American families residing in the suburbs, the majority of African American students remain concentrated in public schools where a larger portion of the population is low income and from a racial or ethnic minority background, regardless of whether they attend urban or suburban schools (Farley & Frey, 1994) . Furthermore, relatively little is known about how patterns of racial segregation may influence racial gaps in achievement depending on the urbanicity of the school that the student attends. This study examines whether racial gaps in the learning process differ depending not only on the racial composition of the school but also the school's urban, suburban, or rural location.\nhalf of the students in the 12th grade sample were selected to have surveys administered to their teachers. Since the student engagement measure is based on teacher reports, this would have severely reduced the sample size and limited my ability to examine cross-level interactions between student and school characteristics. I simplify the racial comparison by restricting attention to non-Hispanic White and African American students. I also limited the sample to students who attended public middle and comprehensive public high schools. Unlike magnet schools, comprehensive public schools are meant to serve all students and typically have an academic or college preparatory course of specialization as well as more vocational courses. Only students with complete data were included in the analysis. These restrictions yield a final sample of 6,063 White and 650 African American students in 660 public middle schools and 667 comprehensive public high schools.\nI restricted the sample to public schools for several reasons. First, public high schools serve approximately 97% of African Americans and 92% of Whites. Second, a number of studies have demonstrated significant differences in the academic and social organization of private compared to public schools (Coleman & Hoffer, 1987) . Finally, public high schools, particularly those in urban areas, are differentiated into specialized or magnet schools (including school-within-a-school magnets) and comprehensive public high schools, with most public school students attending the latter type of school. Research shows important differences in the climate and curriculum between the two types of public schools (Gamoran, 1996) .\noperate differently in schools with higher and lower percentages of Black students and for urban and suburban schools. While prior research has often included the percentage of minority students or White (non-White) students as a continuous variable in analyses of achievement, this study seeks to examine whether the influence of individual and school-level predictors on the Black-White achievement gap differs for students in more highly segregated school systems. Thus, I use an item available from the restricted principal (school) survey on what percentage of the student body was composed of African American students. I then divided 8th-grade students into two groups: students who attended High Minority middle schools where more than 25% of the student body was Black and students who attended Low Minority middle schools where less than 25% of the student body was made up of Black students. This resulted in a sample of 131 High Minority and 529 Low Minority middle schools. The majority of students in the sample who attended a High Minority middle school also attended a High Minority high school. I also created two dummy variables for middle and high schools located in urban and rural areas and include them as predictors in the analysis.\nI also included four additional measures of 8th-grade and 10th-grade school characteristics derived from the principal (school) survey. To measure poverty concentration, I used an item in the principal survey that indicated the percentage of students receiving free or reduced-price lunch. I included total school enrollment and a dummy variable for middle and high schools located in the South. Since there is variation within both kinds of schools in the percentage of Black students (i.e., in the \"Low Black\" schools, students could attend schools with less than 1% Black students, up to 24%), I included a continuous variable for the percentage of Black students in the school.\n\nengagement) during 8th grade (Model 2). Note that math class has been recoded so that higher values correspond to a higher math class. On average, students in Low Minority schools are rated as having slightly better overall engagement. In contrast, students in High Minority schools have significantly lower engagement. Furthermore, African American students in High Minority urban schools have lower engagement (approximately one half a standard deviation) compared to African American students in Low Minority urban schools. The patterns of the Black-White gap in engagement look very similar to those for math class. The Black-White engagement gap is virtually zero in Low Minority suburban, urban, and rural schools, indicating that there are really no differences between African American and White students in their teacher reports of school-related behaviors across school location. However, the Black-White engagement gap is substantially greater in High Minority schools, particularly if the schools are located in urban and rural areas. The coefficient for Math Class indicates that taking higher level math courses is associated with better teacher reports of academic engagement in Low and High Minority schools. The effects of math class on teacher reports of engagement are also greater for students if they are in High Minority urban schools. Thus, although African American students are less likely than similar White students to take higher level math classes in High Minority urban schools, the benefits of taking a higher level math class on engagement are actually stronger in these kinds of schools.\n\n"}, {"section_title": "Current Study", "text": "Previous research shows that African American children enter elementary school with less knowledge and skills than White children and continue to show lower academic achievement (both in terms of scores on standardized tests and in course grades) in subsequent grade levels (Jacobson et al., Lleras 2001; Phillips, Crouse, et al., 1998) . Among older students, there is also evidence that Black students initially fall further behind similar White students (e.g., same prior scores, socioeconomic status) in math achievement, for example, during middle school and the first years of high school, compared to other grades (Phillips, Crouse, et al., 1998) . Of course, the amount learned in each of these grades depends on the skills, knowledge, and effort the student brings to school, as well as the opportunities to learn provided by the school (Carbonaro, 2005; S\u00f8rensen & Hallinan, 1977) . Thus, racial gaps at any point in this learning process may have substantial implications for African American students' educational performance and success. At the same time, and net of other variables, it has been found that high concentrations of minority students are associated with lower achievement among both White and African American students (Bankston & Caldas, 1996; Roscigno, 1998) . This is probably the result of a process in which lower performance, a less demanding curriculum, and lower student effort reinforce one another over time. However, this process has never been examined separately for Low and High Minority schools.\nLearning does not occur in a vacuum but takes place within the social and organizational context of the school. Since most African American students attend racially segregated schools, the racial gap in achievement may be partly due to different learning processes within Low and High Minority schools. Furthermore, each school's geographic location may influence the school's academic and social climate, thereby affecting student achievement. To examine the details of this process and its contribution to the Black-White achievement gap, I estimate a series of models of the learning process in which the student's race affects the student's skills, engagement, and learning opportunities, which in turn, affect one another over time, controlling for family background. Furthermore, I estimate how this process of learning differs by the racial composition of the school the student attends as well as school location."}, {"section_title": "Method Data and Sample", "text": "This study uses data from the restricted base year and first follow-up surveys of the NELS (1988) (1989) (1990) .

In other words, the effects of these exogenous predictors are constrained to have a constant effect on the outcomes across schools."}, {"section_title": "13", "text": "(1) (2) 8th-grade measures of academic engagement and math test score, and math course sequence in the first 2 years of high school. The mathematics test score in 10th grade is then regressed on race, 8th-grade mathematics test score, and 10th-grade student engagement and math course sequence in the first 2 years of high school. Table 1 shows the means and standard deviations of the variables, separately for Black and White students within Low and High Minority schools. The means shown are weighted by the sample weight provided in the second wave of the NELS. Both 8th-grade and 10th-grade course placements for Black students are similar across the two school types. By comparison, Whites have considerably higher course placement within each school type. The 8th-grade White distribution across math courses is similar across the two school types but somewhat higher in High Minority compared to Low Minority schools. However, this modest difference narrows and almost disappears in 10th grade, so that Whites get very little course taking advantage by being in High Minority rather than Low Minority schools. Thus, course taking is distinct by racial group, but for each group, similar across Low and High Minority schools."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Descriptive Statistics", "text": "In looking at school engagement, at both time periods and in both school types, White students are judged by their teachers to have better school engagement than African American students. The Black-White engagement gap grows in Low Minority schools between 8th and 10th grades and declines in High Minority schools. Mathematics test scores show a tendency to vary more by racial group than by school type. Thus, 8th-grade scores show Whites averaging 38.5 in Low Minority schools and 37.1 in High Minority schools, whereas African Americans average 30.3 in Low Minority schools and 28.7 in High Minority schools. By 10th grade, Whites have gained, on average, 9 points in each school type, and African Americans have gained, on average, 8 points in each school type. Thus, the Black-White achievement gap increases slightly within each school type between 8th and 10th grades. In addition, among African American students, the math gap across Low and High Minority schools increases over time. In 8th grade, African American students in High Minority schools scored 1.65 points below Black students in Low Minority schools, and by 10th grade, African American students in High Minority schools scored 2.21 points below African American students in Low Minority schools.\nThe control variables have characteristic distributions for each racial group, and these are generally similar across Low and High Minority schools. Thus, within each school type, African American students have a higher share of single mother and low socioeconomic households, whereas Whites average higher levels of mother's education. Similar patterns apply to average school-level characteristics for each race group across the two school Lleras 14 types. The exception is that both Black and White students who attend schools with a higher percentage of African American students are also much more likely to attend urban schools and schools with high concentrations of poverty. Table 2 presents the final intercept and slopes-as-outcome HLM models predicting 8th-grade math class, academic engagement, and math achievement test score. This table gives us a picture of where 8 school years of differential opportunities and experiences place students by the end of the 8th grade, and specifically, whether African American students in High Minority schools are particularly disadvantaged. All analyses include school-level controls for school size, region, and poverty composition, as well as individual-level controls for family socioeconomic background, single-mother household, maternal educational attainment, and sex. Since individual level predictors were centered on their group means, the intercept can be interpreted as the mean outcome (i.e., math class, academic engagement, math achievement) in school j. The Black coefficient essentially represents the Black-White gap in school j or the mean difference between Black and White students in math class, engagement, and achievement. The other predictors in the models (math class and academic engagement) represent the differentiating effect of these predictors on the outcome in school j or the degree to which differences in math class and engagement among students in school j relates to the outcome. The urban and rural coefficients represent the extent to which the intercept and slopes move up or down and represent the extent to which the effects of the predictors differ by school location."}, {"section_title": "HLM Regression Results for Eighth Grade Outcomes", "text": "The first endogenous outcome is 8th-grade math class estimated separately for students in Low and High Minority schools via an ordered logistic HLM model (Model 1). On average, students in both Low and High Minority schools are less likely to have taken higher math classes by the end of 8th grade. However, students in urban and rural High Minority schools have an even lower chance of completing higher level math courses by the end of 8th grade. In contrast, there are no effects of school location on math class taken in 8th grade in Low Minority schools. The Black-White gap indicates that without controls for prior achievement, African American students are significantly less likely to take higher math classes compared to White students, particularly in High Minority schools. While the effects of school location on the Black-White math class gap are not significant, it is interesting to note that the Black-White gap in 8th-grade math class is greatest in suburban High Minority schools, followed by urban High Minority schools. Overall, these results indicate that African American students are less likely to leave 8th grade having taken higher level math courses such as pre-Algebra compared to their White classmates, particularly if they are in High Minority schools.\nThe second columns show the results from the HLM slopes-as-outcomes model predicting teacher's judgments of students' effort in class (academic"}, {"section_title": "16", "text": "So far, the results from the first two models of 8th-grade math class and academic engagement indicate that racial gaps may operate differently in Low and High Minority schools, as well as across suburban and urban contexts. The third columns of this table show the results from the HLM model predicting 8th-grade mathematics achievement (Model 3). The intercept again shows that on average, students who attend High Minority schools are disadvantaged. Overall, the mean achievement at the end of 8th grade is substantially lower for students in High Minority compared to Low Minority suburban schools. In addition, within Low Minority schools, students in urban schools actually have significantly higher overall math achievement compared to students in suburban schools. However, the exact opposite is true within High Minority schools. On average, students in High Minority urban schools leave 8th grade having significantly lower mathematics test scores compared to students in High Minority suburban schools. The same is also true for rural schools, but the effect fails to reach significance.\nNet of the control variables, as well as the causally prior math class and academic engagement variables, African American students score significantly lower than Whites in both Low and High Minority schools. This racial mathematics test gap in 8th grade also appears to be substantially larger in High Minority compared to Low Minority suburban schools. As in the models of math class, the largest Black-White gap in achievement is in High Minority suburban schools, followed by High Minority rural and urban schools.\nAs for the effects of math class and academic engagement, they are positive and statistically significant. The effect of math class on achievement also appears to be larger in Low Minority than in High Minority suburban schools. That is, the learning pay-off for being in a more advanced mathematics class is larger in Low Minority suburban schools. However, the pay-off in terms of achievement for students who take higher math in High Minority urban schools is similar to students in Low Minority suburban schools. Academic engagement also seems to help boost academic achievement more in High Minority versus Low Minority schools, with the largest coefficient for students in High Minority urban schools. Table 3 shows the analysis of 10th-grade outcomes, again estimated separately for students in Low and High Minority schools. The first model (Model 1) shows the results from the HLM ordered logit model predicting math course sequence during the first 2 years of high school. As in the results for 8th-grade math class, on average, students are less likely to take higher math courses during their first 2 years of high school. In High Minority schools, there is a slight negative effect on course taking in urban and rural schools, but the coefficients fail to reach significance. African American students in both Low and High Minority schools are not significantly less likely than Whites to complete higher levels of math in 9th and 10th grades, net of causally prior variables: math class, academic engagement, and math achievement in 8th grade. This replicates previous findings that show that once prior achievement is controlled, no racial differences in track placement persist (Kelly, 2004; Lucas & Gamoran, 2002) . However, comparing African American students' coursetaking patterns across the two types of schools reveals some important differences. While African American students in Low Minority urban schools are actually more likely than Whites to take higher level math courses during the first 2 years of high school, just the opposite is true in High Minority, urban schools. Furthermore, African American students in rural High Minority schools are significantly less likely to take higher math courses compared to their White classmates. Within High Minority schools, the racial gap in math courses is virtually zero in suburban schools. This is different from the models predicting 8th-grade math class, where the gap was actually highest in suburban High Minority schools. This result suggests that much of the gap in suburban schools is accounted for by prior achievement, coursework, and engagement. Whereas, the racial gaps in High Minority urban and rural schools is still present and quite large, even after controlling for these variables. African American students attending these kinds of schools are much less likely to take higher math courses even after controlling for prior math achievement and math class in 8th grade."}, {"section_title": "HLM Regression Results for 10th-Grade Outcomes", "text": "As for the causally prior endogenous variables, they are significant and in expected directions. That is, prior math class, student effort or engagement, and math achievement are all positively related to 9th-grade and 10th-grade mathematics course taking. These effects are of similar magnitude across the two types of suburban schools, but prior academic engagement seems to be a more important predictor of high school math sequence for students from High Minority compared to Low Minority schools. Once again, the urbanicity of the school also makes a difference. Prior math class is more strongly related to math course-taking patterns in high school in High Minority schools located in urban areas. Thus, on average, students attending High Minority schools who take a higher math class in 8th grade are much more likely to enroll in higher math courses if they attend urban High Minority high schools. This demonstrates that the stability of course placement over time is much greater in High Minority urban schools and suggests that students who fail to take higher math courses early on in the schooling process may be at a particular disadvantage later on if they are in High Minority urban schools. Model 2 presents the results from the HLM model predicting 10th-grade academic engagement. On average, students in minority schools have significantly lower engagement, particularly if those schools are located in urban areas. There are no significant differences between African American and White students in levels of academic engagement. Prior engagement, math achievement, and math course sequence all have positive and significant effects on 10th-grade engagement in Low and High Minority schools. However, the effect of math course sequence on academic engagement differs between urban Low and High Minority schools. In Low Minority urban schools, students who take higher math courses during the first 2 years of high school are significantly more likely to have better engagement. However, just the opposite is true in High Minority urban schools. In these schools, taking more challenging math courses does not result in better ratings of academic engagement from teachers."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This study has sought to extend our understanding of the micro processes underlying Black-White differences in school achievement. In particular, this study has investigated whether the schooling feedback process among math placement, engagement, and achievement differs across predominantly Black (High Minority) and predominantly White (Low Minority) schools. Furthermore, I have examined how initial racial gaps in math course placement, engagement, and achievement played out over time in Low and High Minority urban, rural, and suburban schools. Overall, the results indicate that math course placement, engagement, and student achievement positively affect one another over time, and these effects occur within both Low and High Minority schools. That is, less desirable habits and lower skills in middle school translate into even greater gaps in skills, habits, and achievement in high school. In most schools, the lower achievement gains by African American students compared to White students are almost entirely accounted for by differences in prior achievement, math course sequence, and to a lesser extent, current engagement. However, substantial racial gaps in math achievement remain in suburban Low Minority schools as well as urban and rural High Minority schools, even after controlling for prior math score, math courses, and engagement.\nThe relative magnitudes of the effects of these three variables on one another over time and across Low and High Minority schools are summarized in Table 3 ) show the predominance of Matthew effects in the learning process as well as the need to take into account school location when looking at this process within Low and High Minority schools. In schooling, as in the scientific citations studied by Merton (1968) , individuals who attain an early lead tend to lengthen this lead over time, and those who fall behind early tend to fall further behind over time. For example, the biggest predictor of math course-taking patterns in the first 2 years of high school is prior math achievement, except in predominantly Black, urban high schools. In these schools, the strongest predictor of math course-taking patterns in high school is prior 8th-grade math class. Consistent with findings by Mickelson (2001) , the results suggests an even stronger Matthew effect for course enrollment over time in predominantly Black urban schools. In other words, students that do not enroll in higher math courses in 8th grade may be particularly disadvantaged in terms of the likelihood that they will be placed in higher math courses in high school particularly if they attend predominantly Black urban schools.\nThe standardized coefficients of the model predicting 10th-grade math achievement again demonstrate the depressing effect High Minority urban schools have on student achievement. For students in High Minority schools, the effect of prior math achievement is substantially lower if they are also in urban schools. In other words, the stability of achievement over time is weaker in urban High Minority schools. Furthermore, the effect of math course sequence on math achievement is much stronger in urban High Minority schools. This suggests that predominantly Black urban high schools may be particularly hard on students who are taking average or less challenging mathematics courses. Two other findings help complete the picture of how the Black-White 10th-grade gap in mathematics achievement is formed and relates to both racial segregation and school urbanicity. First, the results show that although the learning process looks similar in the two types of schools, racial segregation is detrimental to the overall learning process. Students in High Minority middle schools leave 8th grade with lower math achievement, lower student engagement, and having taken less demanding math classes compared to students in Low Minority middle schools. By the close of 10th grade, these initial disadvantages have cumulated into greater gaps in learning outcomes, particularly for students who attended predominantly Black urban high schools. Second, the largest Black-White gap in achievement exists in High Minority urban schools and the smallest in High Minority suburban schools (see Figure 1 ). Both results demonstrate the disadvantaged position of White and particularly African American students who attend predominantly Black urban schools compared to similar students in High Minority suburban or Low Minority schools. This study highlights the importance of addressing early gaps in skills, academic engagement, and opportunities for learning as a way of reducing the powerful feedback effects that foster incremental inequality throughout the schooling experience. However, since this study was restricted to the experiences of older students in middle and high school, we still do not know the magnitudes of these effects or how the details of the learning process impact students throughout the schooling experience. Therefore, one direction for future research is to examine the beginnings of the learning process in elementary school to see how initial inequalities are exacerbated or reduced by the learning environment provided by the school. The newly released Early Childhood Longitudinal Study offers the data needed to examine these processes within a national cohort of students beginning in elementary school. The results of this study also suggest that it is important to consider what role racial composition combined with school location may play in generating racial gaps in achievement. Indeed, future research should examine what aspects of suburban High Minority schools make them more conducive to academic achievement among African American students."}, {"section_title": "23", "text": "Overall, the empirical results suggest that increased access to more advanced and rigorous coursework could have a significant impact on African American math achievement directly and indirectly via improved student engagement and behavior, particularly in predominantly Black urban schools. Since many African American students attend High Minority schools where lower level courses predominate, they are less able to take advantage of the benefits of higher level coursework. Therefore, reforms that increase the academic rigor of mathematics courses within high minority schools as well as efforts aimed at desegregation are likely to reduce racial gaps in student achievement.\nWhile policy makers have spent decades developing programs aimed at reducing inequalities among students, these interventions, primarily focused on improving test scores, have been largely unsuccessful. Rather than focusing solely on improving test scores, this study shows that schools may also be able to impact educational trajectories by creating academic and social environments that foster both academic and behavioral development among students. Universal preschool and the expansion of Head Start may go a long way in reducing behavioral and learning disparities among children before the 1st grade. However, additional support, in the form of tutoring programs and improved access to challenging coursework are crucial to reducing the feedback effects from initial inequalities that foster racial differences in academic achievement throughout the schooling experience."}, {"section_title": "Note", "text": "The author's research examines the micro processes involved in educational and labor market stratification, with an emphasis on explaining race and class differences.
