[{"section_title": "", "text": "Let us acknowledge at the outset that it's not a perfect study. (We offer some thoughts as to how we and others might approach this thorny topic in the future.) Let us admit that its conclusions are more nuanced, even equivocal, than we're accustomed to. And let us recognize that, just as we were gathering and analyzing reams of data, multiple factors-economic difficulties, political shifts, court decisions, changing policy agendas, the arrival of many new players-conspired to produce enormous flux in precisely the realms that we were examining. Sometimes we found that a mere month could render part of our laboriously-assembled data obsolete; we adjusted where we could, but eventually had to cease collecting and start making sense of our data. In the end, we learned a ton-about individual states, about national patterns, Everyone knows that teacher unions matter in education politics and policies, but it's hard to determine just how much they matter-and whether they wield greater influence in some places than in others. There's plenty of conventional wisdom on this topic, mostly along the lines of, \"unions are most powerful where they represent most teachers and least consequential where their bargaining rights and revenues are restricted.\" But is that really true? And even if it is, does it oversimplify a much more complex and nuanced situation? Veterans of the ed-policy wars-including our own trustee Rod Paige, who is both a former U.S. Secretary of Education and a former local superintendent in the biggest district in the biggest state that bans collective bargaining-insisted to us that teacher unions exert influence in many ways at many levels, not just at the bargaining table. This deserved deeper investigation, particularly since union critics (many of them also ardent education reformers) generally assert that unions are the greatest obstacle to needed changes in K-12 schooling, while union defenders (and supporters of the education status quo) insist that these organizations are bulwarks of professionalism and safeguards against untested innovation. Here are a few highlights: \u2022 Teacher strikes, like the one recently concluded in Chicago, are legal in fourteen states and illegal in thirtyseven. \u2022 Thirty-two states require local school boards to bargain collectively with their teachers, fourteen states permit local boards to do this, and five states prohibit collective bargaining altogether (Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia). \u2022 Twenty-three states are \"right to work\" states, which prohibit unions from collecting agency fees from nonmembers.* Twenty-eight jurisdictions allow agency fees. \u2022 In the 2010 state election cycle, teacher unions in twenty-two states were among the top ten overall donors (excluding individual donations) to candidates for governor and other executive positions, legislature, high court, and elected education positions. In twenty-one states, they were among the top five highest-giving interest groups (including Colorado and Indiana, where they ranked first). \u2022 In just two states (Pennsylvania and New Jersey) did our survey of insiders unanimously deem teacher unions to be the most influential entities in shaping education policy over a recent three-year period. But informants in twenty states found the teacher unions to be generally more influential, on average, than all other entities (including the state school board, state superintendent, governor, legislators, business interests, and advocacy groups). \u2022 The unions' influence may be waning at the state level. For the three years prior to the 2011 legislative session, education policies in most states reflected union priorities. But in 2011, a growing number of legislatures were enacting policies that were less in line with union priorities. Note that we did not link our overall rankings to state-level student achievement. Of all the data included in our metric, only a few of them (like teacher employment policies) might affect student achievement. Others, like state spending on education, could \"touch\" students indirectly, but there's no strong evidence to support their link to student performance. We also have a timing problem since many state policies are in flux and don't align with point-in-time snapshots of achievement. Plus, we know that many other factors at both the state and local level could impact students, so theorizing that a relationship exists between state-level union activity and student achievement strikes us as short-sighted. Still, we can't resist eyeballing whether policies in a few high-performing states are more in line with the positions of reformers or traditional unions (without pointing fingers either way).

Two other high achievers, Virginia and Colorado, part ways: In the Old Dominion, policies are highly aligned to union interests, but that's not the case in the Centennial State. And education policies in California, with its dismal achievement record, largely do not reflect union interests, while those in Mississippi, another notorious low performer, are more aligned to them than nearly anywhere else.* All of that to say that no one on either side of the ed-reform divide should be glib about this topic. Plenty more is waiting to be learned about teacher unions, how to gauge their strength in the many venues and mechanisms by which they exert it, and their role in education policy.

On one hand, critics argue that these unions, using their powerful grip on education politics and policy to great effect, bear primary responsibility for blocking states' efforts to put into place overdue reforms that will drive major-league gains in our educational system. Such critics contend that the unions generally succeed at preserving teacher job security and other interests, and do so at the expense of improved opportunities for kids. On the other side, we find union defenders who stoutly maintain that these organizations are bulwarks of professionalism in education, that their power is greatly exaggerated, that their opposition to misguided reforms is warranted, and that they couldn't possibly account for achievement woes-considering that highly unionized states perform at least as well as any others (and better than many) on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and other indicators. Both sides agree that, for better or worse, teacher unions look out for teacher interests. This study sheds light on how they use politics to do this, by measuring teacher union strength, state by state, more comprehensively than any other study to date. It sought answers to three questions: 1. What elements are potential sources of a union's strength (i.e., inputs)? 2. How might unions wield power in terms of behavior and conduct (i.e., processes and activities)? 3. What are signs that they have gotten their way (i.e., outcomes)? We do not limit the answers to those questions to routinely-studied channels of union strength such as membership density and bargaining status, though we do include those. We also include such other measures as alignment between state policies and traditional union interests, union contributions to political campaigns, and the impressions of union influence held by knowledgeable participant-observers within the states. We chose to focus on state-level unions rather than local ones, because the state organizations are apt to affect education policy on a large scale.\nObviously there is nothing inherent to geography that dictates union strength. But it is correlated with factors that dothe history of collective bargaining, the rhetoric of unionism, and overall political or ideological orientation. Places where unions have long been regarded as necessary and valuable parts of the economy and polity are more apt to mandate bargaining and to allow the collection of agency fees. Employees are also more likely to join unions themselves in areas with long-standing favorable attitudes toward organized labor. And in places that are ideologically liberal, voters are more prone to hold favorable views of unions and to elect Democrat leaders, who in turn tend to be more receptive to union interests. The states with the strongest teacher unions (Tier 1, mapped in red) are in the Northeast and on the West Coast. All of these states have mandatory bargaining, allow agency fees, and have high membership rates. They are politically and ideologically liberal, and unions there rank highly in perceived influence. The Tier 2 states in light orange are mostly in the Midwest, which is also historically (and currently) pro-labor but politically more moderate. These states allow agency fees, and the unionization rate is high even though some permit rather than mandate bargaining. Unions there tend to be politically active, since elections and policy outcomes are less predictable than in the Tier 1 states. In contrast, the western and central states are largely rural and politically conservative, with little history of unionism. They generally rank in Tiers 3 and 4 (blue and green). Many of them bar agency fees and have low unionization rates, even where bargaining is mandated. But unions there, as well as most in New England, benefit from the value placed on local control over restrictive state mandates. As a result, the policy environment tends to be aligned with union interests because there aren't many statewide education policies as such. Finally, the South is home to the Tier 5 states with the weakest unions, mapped in brown. These jurisdictions are both ideologically conservative and historically anti-union. Here bargaining is either prohibited or permitted, but not mandatory; union membership is low, even where bargaining is allowed; and education policy is not aligned with union interests."}, {"section_title": "OUR APPROACH", "text": "To gauge union strength at the state level, we gathered and synthesized data for Internal union resources (members and revenue), plus K-12 education spending in the state, including the portion of such spending devoted to teacher salaries and benefits."}, {"section_title": "Area 2: Involvement in Politics", "text": "Teacher unions' share of financial contributions to state candidates and political parties, and their representation at the Republican and Democratic national conventions."}, {"section_title": "Area 3: Scope of Bargaining", "text": "Bargaining status (mandatory, permitted, or prohibited), scope of bargaining, right of unions to deduct agency fees from nonmembers, and legality of teacher strikes.\nThis area links union strength to state laws directly related to collective bargaining. Is such bargaining mandatory, permitted, or prohibited? How broad is the scope of that bargaining (i.e., which issues can or must be negotiated in a collective bargaining agreement? Which are barred from consideration?)? And do unions have legally protected revenue sources, like the right to collect agency fees from nonmembers, or do right-to-work laws stop them from doing so? Bargaining status and agency fees measure state union strength because both affect the resources, status, and leverage of unions at all levels. Not only can bargaining bring a union increased membership and revenue from those members, it also gives a union visibility and status. And with high membership, a state union can more credibly claim that it represents teachers as a constituency, which in turn lends weight to its lobbying and advocacy campaigns and increases state-leader receptivity to its efforts. Mandatory bargaining laws facilitate (and/or signal) a strong union presence, and with that presence unions can better use their political muscle to influence state policy. Agency fees allow unions to collect revenue from all teachers, not just union members, which in turn can be used to fund political (and other) activities. Many past observers have assumed that bargaining status and agency fees were the only important indicators of union strength, with strong unions in mandatory bargaining states and in places where they can collect agency fees. (These two ideas-bargaining status and right-to-work laws-are separate from one another but often conflated. See Getting the Terminology Straight, page 18.) While limited ability to secure funds from non-members (part of the right-to-work definition) might weaken a union, we also found that many teacher unions in such states are able to amass resources and exert authority using other channels of influence. Likewise, we found a number of unions in permitted-bargaining states that ranked higher (on our overall metric) than their counterparts in mandatory-bargaining states. That's because bargaining status alone did not determine their might. In addition to bargaining status and agency fees, we examine the scope of bargaining, the legality of teacher strikes, and whether or not unions can automatically deduct dues from the paychecks of their members. States that limit the scope of bargaining, prohibit strikes, and prevent automatic payroll deductions are limiting unions' financial resources and leverage."}, {"section_title": "Area 4: State Policies", "text": "Degree of alignment between teacher employment rules and charter school policies with traditional union interests.\nThis area measures teacher union strength by the degree of alignment between state education policies and certain traditional union priorities. The indicators examine two types of policies in which unions have shown considerable interest: teacher employment rules and charter school laws. The former policies include teacher evaluations, tenure, layoffs, class size, pensions, and performance pay. The latter include laws related to the number and variety of charter schools; the ease with which they are authorized; and whether or not charters are exempt from state laws (including teacher certification requirements), district regulations, and collective bargaining agreements. By including these policies in our metric, we do not assume that teacher unions shaped them. Even if \"union-preferred\" policies are not direct outcomes of union activity, a favorable policy climate nevertheless represents a status quo that protects the union. For example, to the degree that school choice is constrained within a state, teacher unions need not fear that district schools will lose market share or, by extension, that teachers will sever their union ties while working in the charter or private school sectors. Even if the unions did not influence the policy, they still benefit from the status quo-and preserving that is a lot easier than changing it. Note, though, that our indicators are neutral as to the policies and reforms themselves. In other words, rather than measure whether a union's support of a certain policy or reform is \"good\" or \"bad,\" the metric assumes that teacher unions will take a particular stance on each of the policies, and simply measures the extent to which existing policies align or do not align with that stance. Yes, it oversimplifies a bit to assume that all teacher unions share the same stance on a given policy. Across the nation, a handful of teacher unions have bucked national trends-and the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers differ somewhat in their policy positions. But while some state unions may take a more nuanced or multifaceted view toward certain policies, teacher unions do act in the interest of their members; hence, most will react similarly to the same policies. they do not, in and of themselves, impact state policy outcomes. Further, a unionfavorable policy environment may be the result of a strong, active union, or of longtime public allegiance to an establishmentfriendly culture-allowing labor to lay low rather than needlessly devoting financial or political capital to further an agenda that's already reasonably satisfactory. Or vice versa: The unions are major donors to campaigns-but the state is already predisposed against them or their interests. In such circumstances, a union that gives heavily to campaigns may be more desperate than powerful. Given these complexities, we use data from an original survey of key stakeholders within each state to capture perceived influence: How much sway do these insiders believe the teacher unions carry in their state and in what ways? The survey asks whether the positions of policymakers are aligned with those of teacher unions, how effective the unions have been in stopping policies with which they disagree, and how influential the unions are in comparison to other entities in the state, among other areas. Table 1 summarizes each area and indicator examined, as well as the percentage of the total score that each represents. We discuss the indicators (and data sources for each) and the weighting system broadly below, and with much greater detail in Appendix A."}, {"section_title": "Area 5: Perceived Influence", "text": "Results of an original survey of key stakeholders within each state, including how influential the unions are in comparison to other entities in the state, whether the positions of policymakers are aligned with those of teacher unions, and how effective the unions have been in stopping policies with which they disagree. Using these data, we rank the relative strength of state-level teacher unions in fifty-one jurisdictions as compared to one another (fifty states plus Washington, D.C.). To do this, we score the state separately on each of the five areas and rank the states according to those scores. We then average the five area scores and re-rank the states accordingly.  We divided the fifty-one jurisdictions into five tiers, from strongest to weakest. Table  ES-2 (page 11) shows the overall rank and tier for each state."}, {"section_title": "RANKINGS", "text": "Many of the states whose teacher unions rank in the strongest tier-such as California, New Jersey, and Washingtonare widely recognized for their powerful teacher unions. Likewise, in many of the weakest Tier 5 states, unions have suffered some major defeats (Louisiana and Arizona) or do not have much of a presence at all. To be sure, bargaining status and agency fees help define-but not completely determine-the rankings (see Table ES-3, which adds these variables). Mandatory bargaining states are shaded in tan, permitted-bargaining states are shaded in green, and bargaining-prohibited states in yellow. Red text indicates that the state does not allow agency fees. Most of the twenty strongest states (Tiers 1 and 2) require collective bargaining. But so does Florida (Tier 5), ranked next-tolast. Three of the twenty-strongest-Ohio, West Virginia, and Alabama-permit but do not require bargaining. Most of the twenty weakest states (Tiers 4 and 5) prohibit agency fees (red text), but three allow this practice (Washington, D.C., New Mexico, and Missouri). Nor do bargaining-prohibited states invariably land in the weakest tier; North Carolina, for instance, is in Tier 4.  "}, {"section_title": "GEOGRAPHY", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "FOUR KEY TAKEAWAYS", "text": "1. Mandatory bargaining appears to tilt the playing field in favor of stronger unions. At the very least, it is a sufficient (though not an essential) condition by which unions are made strong. Where bargaining is optional or prohibited, unions tend to score \"weaker\" on our overall metric. 2. Resources make a difference. Dollars and members are both important. With higher revenue, a state union can not only better finance its lobbying and advocacy efforts, but also increase its capacity to support the activities of its local affiliates. Greater membership means more union representation at the ballot box, more letters and calls to state leaders, and more boots on the ground during rallies and campaignsand in turn, more revenue from member dues. 3. The scope of bargaining matters a lot, too, as does the right (or not) to strike. Local unions can and do use collective bargaining to protect teacher interests, which can (among other things) result in iron-clad job protections for ineffective teachers. When a wide scope of bargaining combines with ill-defined, timid, or absent state policies, local unions have more room to negotiate contracts that serve their goals. And local bargaining isn't the only way to secure teachers interests; sometimes such protections are written directly into state law. 4. The fact that a state has mandatory, permissive, or broad bargaining laws-or its unions enjoy abundant resources-does not mean that state policies are union-favorable and viceversa. Many states in our top two tiers have education policies that are not particularly favorable to teacher unions. Conversely, states without strong collective bargaining rights nonetheless have union-friendly policies. That's because other factors matter, too, sometimes greatly-beginning with state leadership (both past and present), federal policy, the condition of the economy, the influence of other key stakeholders, and the state's own macro-politics."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In recent years, debates over school reform have increasingly focused on the role of teacher unions in the changing landscape of American K-12 education. On one hand, critics argue that these unions, using their powerful grip on education politics and policy to great effect, bear primary responsibility for blocking states' efforts at reforms that would otherwise drive majorleague gains in our educational system by preserving teacher job security at the expense of improved opportunities for kids. 1 Their defenders maintain that teacher unions are bulwarks of professionalism in education, that their power is greatly exaggerated, and that highly unionized states perform at least as well as any others-and better than many-on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and other indicators. 2 This debate has taken on an international aspect, too, as critics of U.S. reform initiatives (and defenders of unions) point out that teachers are unionized all over the world, including in nearly all the countries that surpass us on measures such as the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA).\nMuch ink is spilled over the influence that these organizations do or do not wield on the federal, state, and local levels. And there's little doubt that they do their utmost to influence policy on behalf of their members. In many a capital, the teacher union office building looms large on the streetscape within a block or two of the statehouse. In many a city, the first question asked of any proposed education change is \"will the teacher union be okay with it?\" Serious books have been written about the political power of teacher unions, of which the most prominent recent example is by Stanford political scientist Terry Moe. 4 Much of their focus is on the local collective bargaining process and its capacity to frustrate change (and raise costs) by writing requirements and prohibitions \"into the contract.\" Also typically meriting chapters in such books are the effects of contract provisions on teacher quality, the various ways that unions engage in political activity by running, endorsing, financing, supporting-and opposing-candidates for public office, and examples of clashes between union and education leaders over reform. Yet while we know that unions have multiple channels through which they can exert strength-including but not limited to bargaining, striking, lobbying, and participating in political campaignsmost research to date uses hazy or overly narrow definitions of such \"strength.\" What proportion of teachers are unionized? Is collective bargaining mandatory, permitted, or illegal? Can unions collect agency fees from teachers who choose not to be members?* It's a good start-but it's not enough. Answers to these questions alone don't accurately reflect a union's power; they merely frame the context in which it works. It is like trying to determine whether a runner is fast by measuring his shoe size. So when we (and our colleagues at Education Reform Now, an affiliate of Democrats for Education Reform) wanted to know which teacher unions are more (or less) influential in their respective states, we knew we had to do better. We asked ourselves: What data do we need to more accurately gauge union strength? What else, besides bargaining status, agency fees, and the ability to strike might make a union strong, and on what scale? (Veteran ex-superintendents from states that don't mandate bargaining tend to chortle when we ask whether their teacher unions are less \"powerful,\" almost instantly replying that \"what they can't get at the bargaining table they get at the statehouse,\" or words to that effect.) And once we devised a better measure of strength, how would the unions stack up? Is it possible that in some places they are indeed eight-hundredpound gorillas, but in others more like hamsters? We were aware going in, and are more aware today, that \"teacher union strength\" comes in many forms and can be wieldedand measured-in many ways. (That's true of strength in general, of course. Ask yourself: Who is stronger, the person who can lift one hundred pounds while standing still or the one who can run around the block while carrying fifty pounds?) Carrying out such measures in comparable, Introduction defensible ways is no small undertaking, however. On-point and contemporary data are extremely hard to come by and, while we wanted opinions and impressions from knowledgeable folks on the ground, as well as \"hard\" information, it's no simple thing to determine whom to ask, and what to ask them-much less to get them to respond. So we acknowledge at the outset that this is a pioneering study, fraught with methodological challenges, data difficulties, and judgment calls. We're wary of drawing simplistic conclusions from a large and complex body of data and loath to slice and dice the inter-state comparisons too finely. (You will find, for example, that Illinois is exactly one notch above New York in terms of the \"strength\" of its teacher unions, 8th versus 9th in the national rankings. One would, we think, be crazy to make a huge deal of such a difference.) Accordingly, we are humbler than usual in the conclusions that we distill from this investigation. We hope that this is a start to future work, and we look forward to feedback and commentary from others and for access to better and newer data that we can use to refine future analyses. But this research is a necessary step toward answering the Big Questions: How is union strength related to securing more funding for teachers and education? To the promulgation or obstruction of reform? To student achievement? We can't begin to answer such questions with accuracy until we have a better definition and index of \"strength.\" Nothing that we learned, however, changed the impression with which we began: Love 'em or hate 'em, teacher unions must be taken seriously by educators, reformers, and policymakers. Such folks may decide, whether out of expediency or earnest conviction, to woo or placate union leaders, to compromise with them, or to ride roughshod over them (insofar as that's possible to do), but they cannot avoid paying attention to them. Nor should they. Public education in the United States is an exercise in democratic decision making. Indeed, nearly every significant decision about the organization and operation of American schools is established through the political process. 5 Moreover, public education in the United States is governed by an intricate web of overlapping institutions and decisionmaking mechanisms spread over multiple levels of a federal political system. 6 Teacher unions-like other interest-based membership organizations-use power to try to influence decisions made within this policy-making maze, and they, like other stakeholders in the system, have every right to do so. Others entering that maze must contend with those who already inhabit it. The more new entrants know about the methods, strengths, and weaknesses of existing inhabitants, the better they are apt to fare.\n\n\n"}, {"section_title": "What to believe?", "text": "A few facts are indisputable, beginning with the fact that teacher unions are most definitely large and highly visible. (Consider recent goings-on in Chicago, for example.) Education employs more unionized staff than does any other profession in either the public or private sector.* Between them, the National Education Association (NEA) and American Federation of Teachers (AFT) have some 4.6 million members, a combination of active teachers and other public school employees, college faculty and staff, retirees, and students. 3 AFT President Randi Weingarten (much like the man who built her union, Albert Shanker) is among the most-quoted education commentators in the land. Washington watchers peer closely into the latest federal policy or proposal for evidence of changing relations between the Obama White House and the unions. And their activities are not just limited to the national level, with teacher unions receiving widespread attention for their battle to protect bargaining rights in Wisconsin and Ohio, their position as political and financial heavyweights in California, and their dogged struggle (and strike) against change in Chicago."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION HOW STRONG ARE U.S. TEACHER UNIONS? A STATE-BY-STATE COMPARISON", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ORGANIZATION", "text": "This study compares the strength of state teacher unions via a systematic examination of how these organizations wield power, examining them from multiple angles, including the obvious-such as alignment of state policies to traditional union interestsand some that are less obvious, such as the perceptions of local insiders.

The appendices include a full explanation of our scoring metric and data sources, as well as the rationale for each indicator, and a list of state-level NEA and AFT affiliates. Right-to-work status and agency fees vs. automatic payroll deductions of member dues Right-to-work refers to the union-employee relationship in states where unions are allowed (mandatory or permitted bargaining states). (Prohibited bargaining states are right-to-work by default, because they have no unions.) Right-to-work laws stipulate that no union can require membership as a condition for employment. They also dictate that, should employees choose not to be members (which they are free to do, in any state, at any time), the union cannot charge them involuntary agency fees in lieu of membership dues. In states where unions are allowed, right-to-work status is independent from (and often confused with) bargaining status. Bargaining status describes the district-employee organization relationship; right-to-work status describes the union-employee relationship. So a mandatory bargaining state can also be right-to-work (for example, Nevada, Iowa, Indiana, and Florida), and a permitted bargaining state does not have to be right-to-work (permitted bargaining states Missouri, Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio, and Colorado do not have right-to-work laws). Regardless of right-to-work status, employee organizations are allowed to charge membership dues to those teachers who want to be members. Most organizations collect these dues via automatic payroll deductions-they subtract member dues from each teacher's paycheck. In a handful of states, employee organizations are barred by state law from doing this if those deductions (or portions thereof) are used for political purposes."}, {"section_title": "GETTING THE TERMINOLOGY STRAIGHT", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "20", "text": "HOW STRO N G A R E U.

A STATE-BY-STAT E CO M PA R I S O N\n"}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "SUMMARY OF RESEARCH ON TEACHER UNION INFLUENCE", "text": "Scholars and education policy observers acknowledge that teacher unions are active players in education policymaking and decision making. Historically, research has focused on a few key questions: How do unions influence spending on education? How do they shape policies (and other political processes, like elections)? And how do they influence student achievement? The quest for a link between union strength and education spending-particularly on teacher wages-has received the most attention.* Studies have generally concluded that districts with strong unions pay their teachers more. 7 Other work explored the relationship between union strength and larger policy outcomes, like NCLB-style accountability, teacher merit pay, per-pupil expenditures, and the adoption of charter school laws. 8 Some research has focused not on policy outcomes but rather on the political activity of teacher unions as they lobby for congenial policies and work to elect candidates that are sympathetic toward union interests. One study found that most legislators rank teacher unions as the most active lobbying organization in the state capital, while another found that school board candidates who are endorsed by teacher unions win 76 percent of their elections, compared with just 31 percent of candidates who do not receive such endorsements. 9,10 A host of studies has looked beyond policy to probe for an association between teacher union strength and student achievement outcomes. These analyses are complicated by the fact that teacher unions cannot be randomly assigned to some students or districts in the same way that a new curriculum or instructional strategy can, and so it is difficult to assign causal credit or blame to teacher unions for student achievement outcomes. While some studies have found a generally positive correlation between the presence of a teacher union and student performance on standardized tests, unions are also associated with a widening gap between low-and high-achieving students. 11 Additional studies have linked unions with standardizing education practices and driving additional dollars into public education and classroom instruction. 12 The majority of existing studies rely on narrow measures of union strength, either the legality of collective bargaining or the percentage of teachers who belong to a union (also known as \"unionization density\" or the \"unionization rate\"). Neither, however, captures the nexus between union power and the processes and outcomes of policymaking. Worse, each is potentially misleading: union density is often simply a proxy for bargaining status (or geography and history-some areas of the country are simply more unionized than others). In turn, bargaining status (which applies at the local level) has not stopped many state-level unions from exerting substantial power in the capital. Given the narrow scope of these measures, some scholars have questioned the findings of studies that use them to define and gauge strength, while others have called for more robust, inclusive measures of union influence. 13 Luckily, a more recent wave of research on union influence has heeded that call, recognizing that existing (and limited) approaches have yielded an incomplete and inconclusive picture of how unions affect policymakers, education spending, and ultimately, students. One study measured union strength by combining bargaining status, union density, and union campaign contributions and found that higher rates of union political giving correlate with the adoption of fewer education reform policies. 14 A handful of researchers have quantified local union strength by measuring how much a district's collective bargaining agreement constrains the unilateral authority of its leaders; their findings suggest that restrictive labor agreements have a negative impact on student achievement (the most likely cause being a contract that limits the principal's authority to manage and allocate personnel for student benefit). 15 Still, a common dilemma pervades all of these recent studies. Resolving how teacher unions influence salaries, political outcomes, and student achievement is impossible without an accurate definition of what an \"influential\" union actually meansand that definition is currently lacking. Undaunted by this challenge (others might say na\u00efve!), we set out to bridge this gap, assuming up front that a single variable is a poor proxy for union strength. We posit that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and instead combine a number of variables-thirty-seven, to be exact-to rank the relative strength of state teacher unions. Some of these variables, like bargaining status and union density, are familiar from earlier analyses. But we've added many more-some publicly available information but also new data of our own design. (To our knowledge, this dataset comprises the most data points to date relative to the assets and activities of and perspectives on state-level unions.) In the end, we explain what this complex data quilt tells us. But we're getting ahead of ourselves. Let's turn to an explanation of those data next. Note that we do not attempt to separate inputs, such as membership, from outcomes, such as blocked legislation. We count them both. Our rationale is simple: It is nearly impossible to draw a line between the two. Union-friendly state education policies, for instance, are likely viewed as outcomes-yet they also infuse a union with additional strength (an input), whether or not the union had a strong hand in creating them. More revenue received by a union (frequently viewed as an input) may bolster its political giving (a process) and thus give it more allies among state leaders (an outcome of activities, but also now a source of union strength)-who in turn may favor policies that help the union gather more revenue. High membership gives a union a broader support base from which to fight for legislation, for example, that might limit the growth of charter schoolswhich in turn may help maintain those high membership numbers. The sources of union strength (inputs) and the effects of a strong union are simply inseparable. No single attribute of teacher unions defines their strength. Rather, strength results from a blend of resources, leadership, initiative, relationships, and earlier effectiveness. Each of these characteristics functions on a continuum; each affects and is affected by the others. Nor can one assume that the balance or mix of these characteristics is uniform across the country. The importance of a union's resources or relationships, its leadership and initiative, or its effectiveness in open versus behind-the-scenes political debates, is largely related to the context in which it operates. Teacher unions in states that allow agency fees, for example, may be able to amass greater financial resources than their counterparts in other states, and direct those resources toward campaigning openly-even confrontationally-for politicians and/or policies. A union without extensive revenue may instead work on building relationships through quiet conversations behind closed doors-but ultimately enjoy as much success, demonstrating equivalent power on the outcomes side. Likewise, a teacher union in a state where few stakeholders introduce reform initiatives, or even criticize the status quo, need not invest copious time and money rebuffing challenges, whether they have adequate resources or not; moreover, that lack of challengers itself may-or may not-indicate the union's influence. Thus, we've attempted in this study to capture both visible and invisible (some may say \"hard\" and \"soft\") elements petitions, vote in elections-and to bring in more money are, in many cases, an indicator of influence. Thus we examine teacher union membership and revenues relative to all public school teachers in the state, judging that a critical mass of membership and high revenue per teacher build a necessary foundation for strong unions. We also examine K-12 education spending, including allocations by the state, total per-pupil expenditures, and the percentage of spending that goes to teacher salaries and benefits. expenditures, revenue streams and taxes, pensions and benefits, public employee and education bargaining rules, charter school and voucher laws, and teacher employment policies. One way that unions work for policies aligned with their interests is by ensuring that elected officials favor those interests-or at least do not actively oppose them. Political giving is a key tactic that unions use to support candidates who champion their priorities, eliminate candidates who do not, and encourage incumbent office-holders to remain true to their campaign promises. If a significant proportion of donations to candidates and parties comes from teacher unions, those unions function as key political players and thereby possess significant sway. This category measures the extent to which unions are positioned to influence policymaking, including but not limited to K-12 schooling. The majority of data in this category represents teacher unions' political contributions to state candidates and political parties. Due to time and resource constraints, we could not investigate more nuanced data such as union contributions to winning candidates or union support of one candidate in an effort to remove his competitor. Rather, this category gauges giving to all candidates for state office, regardless of political party or election outcome. We examine giving both to candidates and to political parties, and we compare teacher union contributions to contributions from other politically active sectors and industries in the state. We also examine the percentage of delegates to national political conventions that were teacher union members; those data are another reasonable clue as to the union's influence on the political process."}, {"section_title": "M E T H O D O LO GY", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Designing the Metric", "text": "To develop a metric that measured potential sources, processes, and outcomes of union influence, we first examined the existing research on union activity, asking how others quantified \"strength\" and measured its manifestations. We paid special attention to researchers' reflections on future work needed, as many acknowledged the limitations of their methods and offered recommendations to others in the field. We also assembled an expert team of study advisors (see Acknowledgments, page 5), some of whom are prolific researchers on the topic, and solicited their input on recommended measures of union strength (and the data we might gather to measure it). Combining research, advisor input, and our own experience, we devised the five general areas described above. Next we examined potential data sources, and divided each area into \"indicators\" of strength. Each major indicator is comprised of one or more specific \"sub-indicators\" that represent individual data points. For example, Area 4 encompasses \"State Policies\"; major indicator 4.4 constitutes \"Employment Policies\"; and sub-indicators 4.4.1, 4.4.2, and 4.4.3 measure the degree to which state policies on teacher tenure, layoffs, and dismissal, respectively, align with traditional union interests. (More on the weighting of indicators below.) For the full rationale behind the inclusion of each indicator, see Appendix A. Second, to capture those unseen aspects of influence and power, we fielded a survey of key stakeholders in each state in Summer 2011. These data were used to calculate Area 5. Stakeholders were asked only to respond for the state in which they reside/are most knowledgeable. We reached out to state legislators, chief state school officers and school board members, governors' offices, statelevel charter-schooling organizations, education advocacy organizations, and education journalists in each state. These stakeholders are not meant to be representative of all state residents, but rather of a targeted group of nearly six hundred key policy movers and shakers with direct knowledge or experience with unions in their respective states; hence, they hold more informed perceptions than the general public. For each state, data are only included for those individual survey questions for which we received at least three responses (\"not applicable\" and \"don't know\" were counted as non-response). We acknowledge that this threshold response rate is low; but given that our survey targeted specific knowledgeable stakeholders in each state (and we asked only an average of eleven persons per state to participate), this small sample is not as problematic as it would be in a large-scale survey. Further, survey data comprise only 20 percent of our metric-and these stakeholder responses showed a high degree of alignment with the indicators used to compile the other 80 percent. Note that many of the survey questions asked respondents to characterize teacher union activity over the last three years or during the most recent legislative session. As with the state policies included in Area 4, we recognize that the education policy sector has undergone significant change Finally, while our measures are commonsensical, they nonetheless represent an inexact science. Further, sometimes only small numerical differences separate the states. Thus, after we ranked the states, we divided them into five broad \"tiers\" of union strength, from strongest to weakest. We report the tier in which each state falls, along with its overall ranking, area scores, and indicator scores. The use of tiers is meant to acknowledge the imprecision of the data. As with any exploratory analyses, we invite others to tweak our metric and weighting-and update our data sources-to craft potentially more accurate and robust methods."}, {"section_title": "METHODS HOUSEKEEPING", "text": "of late, particularly given the federal Race to the Top competition, applications for No Child Left Behind waivers, and state elections (in 2010 and 2011) that ushered in many new faces, often Republicans eager to overhaul particular policies (see Methods Housekeeping sidebar). We asked respondents to focus on teacher union strength in these more recent years, rather than historically, to capture current trends. (This is not to say that their responses were not shaped by their overall perspective on union strength, apt to have been formed over many years.) But given the pace of change in just the last year or two, policy over a three-year period is not as static as one would assume. Further, recent changes do in many ways reflect a new weakening of teacher union influence over education policy in some states; whether that waning of teacher union strength will last is another question entirely. As in any research study, our data reflect a moment in time-and the current national and state policy climate made that moment more temporal than most. That said, we note recent education policy changes in the state profile reportsand indicate whether our data were able to accommodate them as of press time. In addition to the data sources noted above, the state profiles (Part V) include brief essays about recent policy-related union activity (typically occurring in 2011-12). These narratives, which appear at the end of each profile, serve as additional context for the more static quantitative data. They are informed by both online and print media, and in a few cases we contacted state insiders when news reports were conflicting."}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis: Grading and Ranking", "text": "After we gathered data for each subindicator described in Table 1, we graded them on a 0 to 4 scale, much like a traditional college GPA scale, with \"0\" reflecting an attribute of a weak teacher union and \"4\" representing an attribute of a strong one. To score a sub-indicator that used continuous quantitative datafor example, unionization rate, per-pupil expenditures, or union donations to candidates-we put the states in rank order from greatest to least and divided that list into quintiles. The states in the highest quintile were scored \"4,\" in the next-highest \"3,\" in the middle \"2,\" near the bottom \"1,\" and in the lowest quintile \"0.\" For example, on sub-indicator 1.1.1: Membership, we ordered states based on the proportion of their teachers who are unionized. The highest quintile-the ten states that had the highest unionization rate-scored \"4.\" The ten with the lowest unionization rate scored \"0.\"* We translated qualitative information into categorical data by assigning a grade from 0 to 4 to particular outcomes. For example, sub-indicator 4.1.1: Performance Pay was drawn from the National Council on Teacher Quality's 2011 State Teacher Policy Yearbook. In response to NCTQ's question, \"Do states support performance pay?\" a state received \"0\" for \"performance included in salary schedule for all teachers\"; \"1\" for \"performance bonuses required to be available to all teachers\"; \"2\" for \"performance pay permitted/encouraged by the state\"; \"3\" for state-sponsored performance-pay initiatives offered in select districts\"; or \"4\" for \"does not support performance pay.\" In cases where there were not five possible outcomes, not all scale points were used. When no data were available for a state, or when a given indicator did not apply to a particular state, scores were coded as \"N/A.\" \u2020 To calculate the overall rank of each state, we first averaged the sub-indicators within a major indicator; then major indicators within the same area; and finally all five areas (with each area thus comprising 20 percent of the overall score), resulting in a final 0 to 4 score. States were then ranked according to their final score, and the list was again divided into quintiles. The ten states with the highest scoresthose closest to \"4\"-were those with the strongest unions. We call these \"Tier 1\" states. The ten states with the lowest scores-those closest to \"0\"-were those with the weakest unions, which we term \"Tier 5.\" Before finalizing the rankings, we used the data to conduct a preliminary evaluation of our measure: Did including multiple indicators truly give us a more robust definition of union strength? Or were they all so tightly correlated that any union that scored highly in one area was scoring highly in all of them? Our analysis indicated that it was the former. Unions that ranked highly in one area did not necessarily rank high (or low) in the others. The highest significant correlation (0.7) was between Area 1: Resources and Membership and Area 3: Scope of Bargaining. This is not surprising, because bargaining status is tied to membership and agency fees to union revenue. But the other significant correlations ranged from 0.2 to 0.5, and some areas were not significantly correlated at all.* This reinforced our contention that strong unions do not look the same everywhere and that it is therefore important to incorporate different measures when defining \"strength.\" This is also why the five areas are weighted equally: we could not justify any one of them determining more of the final score than another. *Of the ten possible pairings among areas 1-5, only six showed significant correlations.

The message for union opponents is fairly clear: If you want to weaken unions politically, focus on prohibiting agency fees and/or mandatory payroll deductions (via \"paycheck protection\" measures), not just on ending the right to bargain collectively. The problem, of course, is that in many states the scope of local bargaining is nearly boundless, often including relentless protection of the jobs of ineffective teachers. This is a matter within the purview of state policy, however. In fact, Lorraine McDonnell and Anthony Pascal concluded that the scope of provisions of a state law were \"significant predictors\" of what contracts included. 18 When permissive bargaining rules combine with ill-defined state policies, local unions have a lot of wiggle room to negotiate contracts that serve their goals more than those of their pupils. Moreover, some state laws protect union interests outright, making bargaining unnecessary. For example, when laying off teachers, only Idaho and Utah prohibit districts from considering seniority, and just eight states allow districts to impose their own layoff rules without negotiations. Contrast this to the sixteen states where the law protects teacher interests (seniority is the sole criteria for layoffs in five states and must be considered as one of several factors in eleven) and the remaining twentyfive, where the state sets no rules at all and layoffs are within the scope of local collective bargaining. that student growth be a \"significant factor\" in teacher evaluations, but does not specify further.* Districts are free to develop their own evaluation systems, or can opt-in to a system designed by the state (in which student achievement counts for half of a teacher's overall evaluation). State law also implicitly allows bargaining over evaluations, meaning that each district can decide whether it will negotiate over the issue, and Chicago Public Schools (CPS) agreed to do so. (Insiders assert that the Chicago Teachers Union, or CTU, refused to negotiate with the district over health care and other benefits unless CPS agreed to negotiate over evaluations.) \u2020"}, {"section_title": "Part II: Findings", "text": "OV E RA L L R A N KS Table 2 displays the overall rank and area scores of each state. We divided our fifty-one jurisdictions into five tiers, from Tier 1 (the strongest) to Tier 5 (the weakest). Table 3 shows the overall rank and tier for each state. Many of the states whose teacher unions fall into our top tier-such as California, New Jersey, and Washington-are widely recognized for having powerful teacher unions. But others-such as Oregon, Montana, and Rhode Island-may come as a surprise. Further, the rankings are only partially aligned to bargaining status (widely used as a proxy for union strength). All of the Tier 1 states mandate collective bargaining, but so does Florida, which ranked next-to-last. Restrictions on bargaining likewise do not automatically determine that a union is weak-not all five states that prohibit collective bargaining are in Tier 5 (North Carolina is in Tier 4), and bargaining is only permitted, not mandated, in three of the twenty strongest (Ohio, West Virginia, and Alabama). We saw this pattern of trends and exceptions across not just bargaining status but every variable we examined. This emphasizes our core assumption: bargaining status, agency fees, and unionization rate alone do not determine what makes a strong union. But a few key factors appear to have a heavy hand in how unions operate in each state. We expand on those factors in the text that follows.  Note: With fifty-one total jurisdictions, each tier comprises ten except Tier 3-the middle tier-which comprises eleven. What might be the cause of these trends? There is nothing inherent to geography that dictates union strength, whether we're talking about teaching or other lines of work. But geography is correlated with factors that do: the history of collective bargaining, the rhetoric of unionism, and overall political or ideological orientation. Places where unions have long been regarded as necessary and valuable parts of the economy will mandate bargaining, and allow unions to collect agency fees to do their work. The scope of bargaining will be wide, because at some point state leaders believed unions should have leeway to negotiate with their employers. Workers are more likely to be unionized if organized labor is part of the state culture, and as a result the unionization rate will be high. Places where the rhetoric and public opinion surrounding unionism is favorable are more likely to trust and value union positions rather than challenge them; these values in turn are reflected in state policies. And in places that are ideologically more liberal, voters are more apt to hold favorable views toward unions and to elect Democrat leaders, who in turn tend to be more receptive to the interests of organized labor.\nSimilarly, every state with teacher unions in the top tier has permissive bargaining laws (Area 3). Once again, none of these states ranks below 20th on this indicator. All ten are mandatory bargaining states and allow unions to collect agency fees, a key source of union revenue. California, which ranks first overall in this area, ranks second in terms of the number of items that fall within the scope of negotiations: wages, hours, transfers, layoffs, evaluations, fringe benefits, leave, class size, and class load are all mandatory subjects of bargaining (along with others). The state also allows teachers to strike. Illinois, Oregon, Montana, Pennsylvania, and Hawaii are also among the top ten most permissive bargaining states. A state's scope of bargaining is likely both an input and an outcome of union strength. The ability to bargain and collect agency fees is an input that confers greater resources and leverage to local unions. This is passed along to the state organizations, which in return infuse their local affiliates with additional strength by which to expand bargaining rights-or to use the other tools in their toolkit more effectively. (See Part II: Evaluating Teacher Union Strength.)\nBut keep in mind that state-level education policy is just one arena where unions can exert strength; equally, if not more important to them, are their local affiliates' capacity to affect district rules through involvement in school board elections, collective bargaining agreements, and such collective actions as rallies, marches, and lobby campaigns to pressure a district's board or superintendent. Unfortunately, measuring local union activity exceeded this project's scope (see Appendix A)and a lot of what state unions do is train their local affiliates on bargaining and organizing, and advocate on their behalf. Further, we're more mindful than ever that that influence and strength do not always get manifested in public. Often what happens behind the scenes can be more consequential. We're also aware that the absence of visible activity or influence can itself be an illustration of strong influence. In some places, the unions have been so influential for so long that they do not face challenges to their power; thus, they need not fork over sizeable contributions to parties or candidates in order to preserve a favorable status quo. This is most prevalent in states that have consistently had Democratic leadership, although we saw it elsewhere as well (see state profiles, Part V). Similarly, unions that enjoy wide collective bargaining rights already may not need to engage in state politics, inasmuch as their local affiliates can protect teacher interests at the district level instead. We're mindful, too, that it's impossible to tally everything that active unions do, even when they do it publicly. Some activities simply cannot be quantified. Unions encourage their members to write letters and make phone calls to legislators in support of (or opposition to) certain policies. They have \"lobby days\" where union leaders and members meet with state lawmakers, or rally at the state capitol-and will often provide transportation so that their numbers are large. During elections, state unions organize their members to volunteer for campaigns, walking precincts and staffing phone banks. Union members and their families represent a sizeable block of voters themselves. But our analyses in Area 2 also taught us a frustrating lessoncampaign finance law simply does not allow us to track every dollar that unions spend on politics. We can track their reported donations to candidates and political parties. But we can't account for what they spend on behalf of a candidate (or against another candidate)-for example, in advertising and mail campaigns, on member mobilization, or on general advocacy and lobbying. Yet, while some unions see favorable policies but don't visibly participate much in politics, others engage intensely, though state policies are not in their favor. Perhaps their activities are an indication of their attempts to reverse existing policies. Or perhaps they are spending sizable sums not in support of a candidate who will embrace their interests, but simply to defeat one whom they know will act against those interests.*\n"}, {"section_title": "PART II: FINDINGS", "text": "These factors are highly aligned with geography. Organized labor in America began with workers in the factories of the Northeast and the railroads of the West, and soon spread to manufacturing in the Midwest. (Compare the economies of these areas to the agrarian economy of the South, which did not have corporatist structures that facilitated organizing and employee participation.) These same areas tend to have long-standing favorable views toward organized labor as a necessary means to protect workers' rights. They are also the parts of the country that in recent years have been lumped together as \"blue states.\" The opposite is true in the South and central parts of the United States-the \"red states.\" Employers rejected organized labor in the South and in the rural central states there was not much need for it. Neither history nor rhetoric nor ideology favors unions in these parts of the country. Given this alignment of geography with factors that contribute to union strength in general, the correlation between location and our rankings shown in Figure 1 is not surprising. The Tier 1 states with the strongest teacher unions, mapped in red, are in the West and Northeast-areas with a history of organized labor, pro-union sentiment, and a liberal ideology. All of these states have mandatory bargaining and allow agency fees, and all ranked highly in Area 5 (Perceived Influence). The Tier 2 states in light orange are mostly in the Midwest, which is also historically (and currently) pro-labor but generally more moderate politically. These states also allow agency fees and, while some permit rather than mandate bargaining, the unionization rate is high regardless. Further, unions tend to be politically active there (Area 2), where political and policy outcomes are somewhat less predictable than in the Tier 1 states. The Tier 3 and Tier 4 states (blue and green) in the West and central parts of the country are largely rural, with little history of unionism, and often fairly conservative in ideology. As such, most of these states prohibit agency fees and have low membership rates, even where bargaining is mandated. On the other hand, in many such states local control is valued over restrictive state mandates, and as a result we see the policy environment (Area 4) aligned with union interests because there aren't many statewide education policies as such. Finally, the Tier 5 states with the weakest unions, mapped in brown, are in the South, where states are both ideologically conservative and historically anti-union. In these states, bargaining is either permitted or prohibited, membership is very low even in states where bargaining is allowed, and education policy is not aligned with union interests. In the pages that follow, we present the overall strongest and weakest of the bunch. Then we examine the strength of state unions by each of the five major areas that we analyzed: Resources and Membership, Involvement in Politics, Scope of Bargaining, State Policies, and Perceived Influence. Table 4 lists the ten states with the strongest teacher unions according to our analysis, both the state's overall rank and its rank within each of the five areas of our metric. As the table shows, even states with Tier 1 teacher unions vary widely across those areas. Hawaii's teacher unions, for example, can claim the greatest political involvement among the top ten states (though Hawaii is tied in that category with Alabama and South Dakota, which fall into Tiers 2 and 4, respectively); New Jersey and New York boast the most significant membership and resources; and California is home to the broadest scope of bargaining and the strongest perceived influence."}, {"section_title": "AMERICA'S STRONGEST TEACHER UNIONS", "text": "What do these strong teacher unions have in common?* The ability to amass people and money, and maneuver within wide legal rights It's unlikely that a teacher union would have much clout if it lacked a strong base in at least one of the following: money, members, or strong collective bargaining rights. Table 4 shows this to be true. Every state that falls into the top tier can claim teacher unions with strong resources and membership (Area 1); none of these states ranks below 20th in this area. In New Jersey and New York, for example, nearly all teachers are unionized (97.1 and Hawaii (Tier 1), Montana (Tier 1), and Alabama (Tier 2) are seeming outliers. Although Hawaii is now politically liberal, organized labor could not gain a foothold in the state until the 1950s (despite decades of trying). Yet it has some of the most permissive bargaining laws and union-favored education policies in the nation, and the state union has more resources-and is more politically active-than nearly anywhere else. Montana is a politically conservative, rural state surrounded by others in the midst of enacting anti-teacher-union legislation by the fistful-yet it mandates collective bargaining, gives it a wide scope, and allows agency fees. Unions are highly active in politics there, and state policies are highly aligned to union interests. Alabama prohibits agency fees and is firmly in the anti-labor, socially conservative south, yet its union is the most politically active in the nation, has one of the highest unionization rates in the permitted bargaining states, and generates a significant amount of revenue per teacher. What might explain the high ranking for these states? Hawaii has only one school district, Alabama only 133. Having fewer local affiliates may allow an otherwise weak state union to direct more of its resources up to the statehouse instead of down to the districts, to mobilize its members more efficiently, and to present a unified front. Hawaii and Montana unified early. The \"unification date\" is when local unions were required to affiliate with, and pay dues to, the state and national association. The three strongest state unions in this report-Hawaii, Oregon, and Montana-were among the first three NEA affiliates to unify, doing so between 1944 and 1946. Early unification gives state unions time to build infrastructure, develop leaders, amass resources, gain allies, and establish a position within the political culture. Alabama is socially conservative but politically liberal. While Alabama voters have supported Republican presidential candidates for 50 years, the Alabama legislature was dominated by Democrats for more than a century (2010 marked the first time in 136 years that Republicans were the majority in both houses). This, coupled with the Alabama Education Association's position as a storied cultural institution, led to a number of labor-friendly policies in what is generally perceived to be a \"red\" state.*"}, {"section_title": "THREE SURPRISING HEAVYWEIGHTS", "text": "98.4 percent, respectively). No other state spends more of its K-12 dollars on teacher salaries and benefits than New York, at 63.5 percent; and New Jersey's unions collect the third-highest yearly revenue per teacher, at $935.62. Washington State, meanwhile, claims both the tenth-largest yearly revenue per teacher ($633.59) and the tenth-largest proportion of its state budget spent on K-12 education (24.3 percent)."}, {"section_title": "A strong perception of influence among insiders", "text": "All of the states whose teacher unions fall into the strongest tier score relatively high in terms of perceived influence (Area 5). Six are perceived to be among the ten strongest in the nation, and only one (Illinois) falls below 25th in this area. With a strong foundation in people and dollars (Area 1), unions maintain a visible presence in the state; and even if they are not always successful in advocating for policies they favor, they are routinely at the table (or very close by). In eight of the Tier 1 states, for example, stakeholders unanimously agreed that teacher unions had fought hard to prevent any reductions in pay and benefits during the recent period of budgetary constraint, rather than conceding that reductions were inevitable. (Only in Illinois and Rhode Island did some stakeholders indicate otherwise.) This does not necessarily demonstrate that the unions were successful, but another set of survey responses suggests that Tier 1 unions do have a voice in the policy design process, even if they could not prevent policies from being introduced. We asked stakeholders whether the education policies proposed by the governor in the last legislative session were in line with union priorities, and also whether the outcomes of that session were in line with union priorities. The answers to both questions were mixed. In Montana and Washington, the proposed policies were fairly in line with union priorities, while in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York they were not. In Oregon and Illinois, the legislative outcomes aligned with union goals. But one thing most Tier 1 states had in common is that the legislative outcomes were more in line with union priorities than were the policies initially proposed. This was the case in Hawaii, California, New Jersey, Illinois, and New York. New Jersey stakeholders reported the biggest difference that we found anywhere (see New Jersey state profile for more), and the change in all five of those states was larger than the national average. In Washington, there was no change between the proposed and enacted policies. Further, when we asked stakeholders to select and rank the five most influential entities in education policy in their state, the national average put the teacher unions third. No Tier 1 state fell below that average, and all but Hawaii ranked their unions as one of the top two major players in education policy. So while unions might not be successful everywhere-and in many places, they were not-they still serve as visible and active authorities in the thick of policy debates."}, {"section_title": "A mixed state policy environment", "text": "Despite these perceptions of union influence, however, many of the states in the top tier have policies that are not particularly favorable to those unions (Area 4). Only three-Hawaii, Montana and New Jersey-rank in the top quintile in this area and four rank in the bottom half nationally. We learn from this that abundant resources, permissive bargaining laws, and a strong reputation do not necessarily yield a favorable state policy environment. For example, Pennsylvania's teacher unions are strong in every other area, ranking among the fifteen strongest on resources and membership, political activity, scope of bargaining, and perceived influence. Yet the state is 41st for its policy environment: It has in place many charter laws that teacher unions typically oppose. Similarly, Illinois's teacher unions, which enjoy permissive bargaining laws and a relatively high level of political involvement, reside in a state with several policies that unions typically spurn: student achievement must be the preponderant criterion in teacher evaluations, some evidence of student learning is considered in tenure decisions, and districts must consider performance when determining layoffs.*\nAs with the strongest teacher unions, the weakest unions are not necessarily found in states with the most unionunfavorable policy environments. Two of them-Mississippi and Virginia-are indeed in states with extremely unionfriendly policies.* In both places, teacher evaluations need not include student achievement data; evaluations need not inform dismissal policies; and tenure is conferred virtually automatically (after three years in Virginia, and after just one year in Mississippi). But other teacher unions in Tier 5 inhabit states with policies that don't align nearly so well with traditional union interests. In Oklahoma and Florida, student achievement must serve as the preponderant criterion in teacher evaluations; evidence of student learning must be the major consideration in tenure decisions; and administrators must consider performance in determining layoffs. Further, Oklahoma dismisses teachers at a higher rate due to poor performance than nearly every other state-3.7 percent annually, compared to Arkansas, which dismisses just 0.2 percent. The policy paradoxes we discussed above apply in these states as well."}, {"section_title": "A mixed level of political activity", "text": "The strongest teacher unions also vary in their generosity to political campaigns (Area 2). Some, such as those in Illinois and Oregon, contribute a great deal, with 3 percent or more of all contributions to state candidates coming from teacher unions. But others, such as those in New Jersey and California, donate less than 1 percent of all contributions to state candidates. This does not mean that the unions are not major players-in California, between 2003 and 2010, they donated $7.3 million dollars to candidates, the second-most in the nation (Illinois was first at $17.2 million). But in California, the total donations to candidates exceeded $1 billion, meaning that the union's dollars made up a very thin slice (just 0.7 percent) of that enormous pie. Compare California's Area 2 rank of 18th to Hawaii (1st), Rhode Island (4th), and Montana (10th), all of which gave less than $650,000 to candidates (in Montana, only $42,000). In those states, candidates simply do not receive that much campaign money, which gives the union dollars relatively greater heft. Perhaps the most impressive entry on this list is Illinois, where elections are among the most expensive in the nation ($474 million, third-most after California and Texas) and unions donated $17.2 million of that to state candidates-a percentage ranking them 1st on that particular sub-indicator.

South Carolina has the lowest membership rate-just 26.9 percent of the state's teachers are union members.* The Palmetto State union also collects the least revenue per teacher in the state-just $51.75 annually, versus a high of $1,370.77 in Alaska. Together, this lack of human and financial resources amounts to feeble power for the state's teacher unions. Table 6 groups states by bargaining status, and shows this to be the case: nine of the ten Tier 5 states either permit or prohibit-rather than require-collective bargaining. (Only Florida mandates it.) Further, all ten states in Tier 5 prohibit the automatic collection of agency fees.* These states are indicated in red. While this study demonstrates that many factors can affect-or reflect-the overall influence of a teacher union, residing in a state that allows unions to collect funds from non-members bodes well for that influence."}, {"section_title": "The perception of weak influence", "text": "With limited ability to collect resources and members, and restricted bargaining rights, it comes as no surprise that the weakest teacher unions carry little weight in the eyes of observers. Seven of the Tier 5 unions rank in the bottom ten states in perceived influence (Area 5). Stakeholders in all of these states routinely report that other entities-such as school boards, governors, and business roundtablesare more influential in shaping education policy. Many note that their state's teacher unions, particularly those in Mississippi, are not effective in protecting dollars for education, nor are they effective in * While states that prohibit collective bargaining are often casually referred to as \"right-to-work\" states, this is not a correct use of the term. \"Right-to-work\" specifically refers to laws prohibiting union membership as a condition of employment; under such legislation, unions cannot automatically collect \"agency fees\" in lieu of dues from non-members. Bargaining status and right-to-work are different, and independent, concepts. For example, Florida both requires bargaining and is a right-to-work state. Should employees wish to form a union, the district must recognize and bargain with that union, but that union cannot collect agency fees from teachers who choose not to join. Note, too, that barring agency fees is not the same as prohibiting automatic payroll deductions of members' dues; in the latter case, unions cannot automatically deduct dues from the paychecks of their own members.

"}, {"section_title": "Part III: Taking a Closer Look-Teacher Union Influence by Area", "text": "As we've already seen, teacher union influence varies greatly across the dimensions that we examined. Strong unions are not strong in the same ways, and weak unions are not necessarily weak on all fronts. This variation underscores the fact that teacher unions are rarely uniform in how they derive influence-and where they direct it. They also differ in their goals and the extent to which they strive to shape policy in public (and quantifiable) ways. In this section, we take a closer look at the teacher unions that ranked strong and weak in each of our five areas.\n(Compare this to Maine's teacher unions, which contributed just 0.02 percent of total contributions to state-office candidates, and Alaska's, which contributed no money at all to state political parties-both ranked in last place in those respective categories.) Most teacher unions targeted either political candidates or parties. For example, Hawaii's unions gave the 9th-largest percentage to candidates (1.5 percent) but the 26th-largest percentage to parties (1 percent); conversely, Michigan's teacher unions gave 0.9 percent to candidates (18th) but 4.2 percent to parties (3rd). The strongest state teacher unions all gave significant amounts to candidates vis-a-vis the highest-giving outside sources (grouped by economic sector) in their states, although their percentages varied. Teacher union contributions in Hawaii equaled 15.4 percent of the total contributed by the ten highest-giving sectors (7th), highest among the top states in Area 2. (Compare this to teacher union contributions in Colorado, which equaled 25.8 percent (1st); and to those in Maine, which only equaled 0.03 percent, the smallest.) It bears repeating, however, that strong unions sometimes have the luxury of not spending money on politics. The strongest unions in this area also sent lots of delegates to the national conventions. In Rhode Island, a full 33.3 percent of delegates were members of teacher unions (compare this to Kentucky, in which no delegates identified as teacher union members). Among the seven strong teacher unions in Area 2, only West Virginia fell below the top ten for this particular measure. (It ranked 19th with 15.2 percent of its delegates identifying as teacher union members.) Teacher unions ranking weakest in this category were not necessarily uninvolved in politics-sometimes they faced competition. This was the case in Virginia, where the union did give a substantial amount of money, but total campaign spending from all sources was high as well. Other unions faced a similar situationexpensive elections-and chose not to give much (Louisiana, Missouri, Arkansas). Then, there were those that stayed out of the game all together-unions in Vermont, Maine, and Arizona did not give much, even though elections in their respective states were not particularly expensive. Regardless of the context, however, donations from these unions amounted to a very small share of both total money and contributions from the sectors representing the ten highest-giving outside sources; nearly all of the weak teacher unions ranked in the bottom quintile in both of these categories.*"}, {"section_title": "A R E A 1 : R E S O U R C E S AND M E M B E R S H I P", "text": "This area measures the internal resources on which unions rely (members and revenue), and the financial resources dedicated to education in the state. While size and funds do not automatically make one union more powerful than another, the ability to amass people and money is, in many cases, an indicator of influence. Thus we examine teacher union membership in each state (relative to all public school teachers) and revenues of each statelevel teacher union, judging that a critical mass of membership and high revenue per teacher build a necessary foundation for strong unions. Though we have no way of knowing whether high spending in a state is the direct result of union influence, it is nonetheless a source of union strength, because unions-and the teachers they represent-certainly benefit from it. Thus we also examine K-12 education spending, by the state and by the districts in the state, and the percentage of that spending that goes toward teacher salaries and benefits. Table 7 shows the strongest and weakest states in this area. The strongest unions in this area uniformly boast high membership densities-all five rank in the top ten nationally on this single indicator, with the lowest-Minnesota-ranking 9th, with 95.7 percent of its teachers unionized. They also bring in substantial revenues per teacher in the state-all rank in the top twenty nationally here, with New Jersey collecting $935.62 per teacher (3rd-highest), and New York pulling in $536.38 per teacher (20th). (Compare that to Alaska with the highest revenue, $1370.77 per teacher, and South Carolina with the lowest, $51.75.) These states also boast high overall spending on education. Most see either high spending on education writ large or a large proportion of per-pupil expenditures going toward salaries and benefits. Few states, however, spend copious dollars on education and direct a large proportion of those funds toward salaries and benefits. For example, New Jersey only directs 52.5 percent of K-12 spending toward teacher salaries and budgets (just eleven jurisdictions direct less), yet overall K-12 spending in the Garden State is large: "}, {"section_title": "AREA 2: INVOLVEMENT IN POLITICS", "text": "This category measures ways in which a state union might influence laws, policies, and budgets. Because many forms of influence are impossible to quantify and compare, most of the data in this category represent the unions' financial donations to candidates and political parties (their share of total contributions, and how they stack up against other sectors like police and firefighter unions, farm bureaus, and major oil and gas producers). And we tally how many delegates to the Democratic and Republican National Conventions were themselves teacher union members. Two methodological notes warrant mention-the first regarding what we counted and the second what we compared-because our report of unions' share of financial contributions is apt to strike the reader as low. First, for the years examined, we combine direct contributions from any national, state, or local teacher union (and the political action committees connected to those unions) to candidates or parties in a particular state. This is not to say that unions did not spend money in other ways. However, campaign finance law does not require unions to tabulate every dollar they spend on politics and how it was spent. Reporting requirements are even more lax for corporations, so the only way to calculate unions' share of political spending is by comparing donations to candidates and political parties. We cannot report or compare spending on behalf of candidates (on advertising, for example, or electioneering communications), spending on member communications (meaning unions advertise to their own members, encouraging them to vote), and support not quantifiable by a dollar amount (such as providing volunteers to walk precincts or make telephone calls). For the same reasons, we must also omit union spending on lobbying and general advocacy.* Further, while we were able to link union-connected political action committees (PACs) with their associated union, we could not do so for single-issue/ideologically-oriented PACs that were only union-supported; these nonconnected PACs donate to candidates (or again, spend on their behalf) but we cannot tabulate those dollars. \u2020 Second, when we compared union contributions with total donations to candidates and parties, the \"total\" amount included both inside and outside money. \"Inside money\" for candidates are those funds provided by the candidate himself, donations from individuals to the candidate's political action committee (PAC), and contributions from political parties. \"Outside money\" refers to donations from external PACs, lobbyists, interest groups, and (depending on state election laws) labor unions and corporations. Between 2003 and 2010, inclusive, candidates for state office raised over $8 billion, with about 36 percent originating from \"outside money\" (from state to state, outside money ranged anywhere from 5 to 60 percent of candidates' total finances). \u2021 Likewise, political parties are funded by \"inside money\"-in this case, donations to parties' PACs from individuals-and \"outside money\" (see above). Between 2003 and 2010, parties raised $1.6 billion, nearly equally divided between inside and outside sources. Because inside money is such a large share of campaign funds, when we divide union contributions to candidates/parties by total dollars amassed by candidates/parties, the union's share (and that of any outside donor) will seem disproportionately small. For further details, see Appendix A. Table 8 shows the strongest and weakest teacher unions in this area. The seven unions that rank strongest in this area vary greatly. Alabama is the only one with teacher unions that donate large proportions to both political candidates and parties: they supplied 2.8 percent of all contributions to candidates (4th) and 9.7 percent of all contributions to parties (1st)."}, {"section_title": "A R E A 3 : S CO P E O F B A R G A I N I N G", "text": "Here we examine bargaining status (mandatory, permitted, or prohibited); the scope of subjects that can (or must) be addressed through bargaining; the union's legal right to collect agency fees automatically and/or to collect member dues via automatic payroll deductions; and the legality of teacher strikes. Table 9 shows the strongest and weakest states in this area. The teacher unions that rank among the strongest in this area all resideunsurprisingly-in states that require collective bargaining, permit agency fees to be collected automatically, and allow teachers to strike. Where they differ is in the range of items that can be negotiated under local collective bargaining. California's unions enjoy the secondbroadest scope of bargaining in the nation. Of the twenty-one items that we examined, eleven must be bargained in the Golden State: wages, hours, terms and conditions of employment, grievance procedures, transfers, layoffs, evaluations, fringe benefits, leave, class load, and class size. (Nevada had the broadest scope, requiring fourteen. \u2020) The remaining ten items may also be bargained, at the discretion of the districts. None of the provisions we examined is explicitly excluded from negotiations. Minnesota, with the next broadest scope, mandates that seven items be negotiated through collective bargaining, explicitly permits two, and does not address the remaining twelve (implicitly allowing their inclusion in the scope of bargaining as well). The four weakest unions in this area-North Carolina, Georgia, Texas, and Virginia-all prohibit collective bargaining, agency fees, and teacher strikes. Alabama, Arkansas, and Arizona-tied for second-to-last placedo not address collective bargaining in education in state law. Districts, then, may decide whether to negotiate with employee organizations, and what may be bargained. These three states do, however, prohibit agency fees.*"}, {"section_title": "A R E A 4 : STAT E P O L I CIES", "text": "This area gauges the extent of alignment between state-level education policies and traditional union interests. The indicators address policy issues largely considered to be important to unions, including teacher employment policies (performance pay, retirement benefits, evaluations, tenure, and dismissal), class size, and charter school policies (limits on the number and variety of charters, the range of authorizers, and collective bargaining exemptions from state laws, district policies, and local collective bargaining agreements). \u2020 Where state policies align with traditional teacher union interests, we rank those unions as strong; where policies are not aligned, they are rated weaker. (See Appendix A for rationale.) Table 10 shows the strongest and weakest states in this area. The strongest teacher unions in Area 4 reside in states with teacher policies that align well with traditional union interests. Teacher employment policies in West Virginia, North Dakota, and Vermont are very much in line with union priorities. In all three, the state does not support performance pay; does not require that Weak teacher unions in Area 4 are found in states where employment law does not offer blanket job security for teachers (that is, without consideration of their performance), and in states where charter law promotes the expansion and autonomy of the sector. In Florida and Michigan, the state requires that performance be factored into teacher pay; that student achievement be the preponderant criterion in evaluations; and that districts consider teacher performance when making layoff decisions. In Arizona, employees are required to contribute to their pension plans at a higher rate than employers (through 2011, just four other states did likewise). Further, Idaho and Minnesota both dismiss relatively high proportions of teachers due to poor performance relative to other states-3.5 and 3.7 percent annually, respectively. Finally, four of these five states have no class size restrictions (Florida does), four permit the widest variety of charter-school types (all but Michigan), and all five exempt charter schools from collective bargaining agreements."}, {"section_title": "AREA 5: PERCEIVED INFLUENCE", "text": "To capture the \"invisible\" side of teacher union strength, we surveyed key stakeholders in each state. We had them rank a number of influential entities in their state, teacher unions included, and asked them the degree to which unions affected policy (both education and financial), influenced elections, and had allies in the capital. We also asked whether existing policies, policies recently proposed by the governor, and policies recently enacted by the legislature, aligned with their state union's priorities. Table 11 shows the strongest and weakest states in this area. It is not surprising that California and New Jersey top the list; both states' teacher unions are famous for the extent of their political and policy influence. Four of the five strongest state unions (not Maryland) are also in the top ten strongest overall. According to stakeholders, in all five of these states teacher unions are either the most or second-most influential entities on education policies (more so than other key players such as superintendent associations, school boards, and governors). Unions in all five states fought hard to prevent cuts in pay and benefits during the recent period of budgetary constraint. And respondents in all five states agreed that the unions generally succeeded in preventing or minimizing cuts. In most of these states, the union benefitted from allies inside government: Respondents in every state but New Jersey indicated that the priorities of state education leaders tend to align with the positions held by teacher unions. And for every state but Montana, respondents noted that, more often than not, their unions need not compromise to ensure that their preferred policies are enacted at the state level. Finally, respondents in all five states agreed that Democrats often need teacher union support to get elected; in Maryland and Montana, Republicans sometimes do, too. One thing the top-five states have in common is that Democrats tend to be in charge. In California, Maryland, and Oregon, that party has a majority in the legislature and also controls the governorship. Montana has a Republican legislature and a Democrat governor, and in New Jersey it is the reverse. But this does not guarantee that the top-five unions in Area 5 have a strong command over recent education policies-which may reflect a wave of challenges to teacher union authority initiated by Race to the Top competitions and No Child Left Behind waiver applications. Stakeholders noted that existing policies in all five states largely aligned with union priorities. But stakeholders also said that the policies proposed by governors during the latest legislative session were less aligned with union priorities than the existing ones. New Jersey stood out among the five; there, stakeholders reported that education policies proposed by Governor Christie were not at all in line with the priorities held by teacher unions, although existing policies often were. Yet respondents went on to indicate that the outcome or fate of those proposals after legislative action were mostly in line with union priorities in that state. For those teacher unions with the weakest perceived influence, respondents uniformly rank the unions as the fourth-or fifthmost influential entity in the state when it came to education policy. In these states, neither proposals nor outcomes of the recent legislative session were in line with union priorities, nor were existing policies. In some states, however, this was not from lack of trying. South Dakota tied for first on its involvement in politics (Area 2), Arizona unions have been fighting tooth and nail against a spate of anti-union legislation (see Arizona's state profile, page 72), and stakeholders in Florida, Mississippi, and South Dakota noted that their unions have struggled forcefully to prevent cuts in teacher pay and benefits. Respondents in Florida and Arizona agreed that Democrats in their states need union support to get elected, but those states, as well as the other three, have Republican governors and legislative majorities. "}, {"section_title": "PART IV: CONCLUSIONS AND TAKEAWAYS", "text": "We conducted this analysis during a period of change, even turmoil, in education policies and politics. The Race to the Top (RTTT) competition, the advent of NCLB waivers, state elections (in 2010 and 2011) that ushered in Republican candidates eager to overhaul particular policies, antiunion sentiment-all of these drove reform in many of the states, even in jurisdictions (such as California and Michigan) where unions have traditionally enjoyed safe shelter. The arrival on the scene of proreform Democrats (most visibly in the form of Democrats for Education Reform and its many state-level affiliates, as well as Secretary of Education Arne Duncan's spirited leadership of federal policy in this realm) has half-erased the old truism that Democrats can be counted upon to do the unions' bidding. In response to these and other changes in the political landscape, the unions are compromising, trading, sometimes conceding on things that they wouldn't have before. For them, these are uncertain and unpredictable times, particularly in the face of epochal reforms such as the universalizing of school choice, the demand for resultsbased accountability, and the widening use of student achievement in teacher evaluations. In many cases, the unions cannot stop such developments, so instead they are mobilizing to shape (some might say weaken) them. We found this kind of behavior in many places, including New Jersey, Arkansas, Minnesota, Nevada, and Kentucky. Labor policy itself has also undergone massive change in the past few years. Wisconsin is the most visible case in point here, but other states have had similar battles. In Ohio, for example, voters repealed S.B. 5 in November 2011 after vigorous union campaigning against the bill. It would have prohibited public-sector strikes, eliminated binding arbitration for employee-management disputes, and narrowed the scope of bargaining. Across the state line in Indiana, Governor Mitch Daniels signed a 2011 bill that restricted the scope of bargaining to wages and benefits. A year later, the Hoosier State became the first right-to-work state in the rust belt (thus prohibiting unions there from collecting agency fees from non-members). The fiscal crunch of the past four years has also imperiled some long-standing assumptions and earlier teacher-union victories. Despite the cushion of federal \"stimulus\" money, states and districts have raised class sizes, closed schools, cut programs, laid off teachers, frozen salaries, reduced health benefits (or required teachers pay more for them), and propped up shaky pension systems by a combination of diminished benefits and increased employee contributions. Recognizing the fluidity of the present situation and acknowledging that our data are a snapshot in time-in some cases an earlier time-we nevertheless leave this analysis with four over-riding impressions. We make no causal claims, nor are any of 1. Mandatory bargaining appears to tilt the playing field in favor of stronger unions. Where bargaining is optional or prohibited, unions tend to rank \"weaker\" on our overall metric.* Consider organizations-regardless of whether they use it to donate to political campaigns, lobby policymakers, finance public relations and advertising campaigns, mobilize members to write letters and rally, or train their local affiliates to bargain and organize. (Indeed, the more money they have, the less they are forced to choose among such power-enhancing activities.) Likewise, membership is important, not only as a source of revenue but also because members themselves are key to boots-on-the-ground efforts. And agency fees allow unions to collect dollars from non-members, enabling them to continue their work (and gain visibility and policy victories, which in turn encourage more teachers to join). This iterative relationship between fees, membership, and revenues virtually guarantees the organizational health of unions in many states. The ability to collect agency fees is especially crucial for unions in states with a low percentage of dues-paying members. Permitted bargaining status can reduce the unionization rate because districts are not required to recognize employee organizations as unions (77 percent of all districts in mandatory bargaining states have unions, compared to 17 percent in permitted bargaining states). Bargaining status alone is not the only contributing factor to low unionization-recall that permitted bargaining states are mostly located in parts of the nation where organized labor is not particularly popular. In all states, regardless of bargaining status, teachers can choose not to organize, or opt to operate as an employee association rather than a union.* Further, in all states, individual teachers can opt out of union membership (and thus union dues). When states allow unions to collect agency fees from non-members, it lessens the effects of decreased membership (and member dues) owing to bargaining status or other factors. Unions in mandatory bargaining states collect an average of $581 annually per teacher in the state; in permitted bargaining states, $296. The nearly $300 difference isn't surprisingmandatory bargaining states have more unionized teachers (83 compared to 61 percent). But the average union revenue in mandatory bargaining states that allow agency fees is a whopping $650, compared to $405 in mandatory states that do not. 16 The fiscal advantage gained by unions in mandatory bargaining states is nearly completely lost if they cannot collect agency fees-especially if mandatory bargaining does not translate into higher unionization. \u2020 Now back to the four states that rank differently than their bargaining status seems to indicate that they should. Ohio, West Virginia, and Alabama do not mandate collective bargaining but do allow agency fees. Not all Tier 5 states prohibit bargaining (Florida requires it, and five others permit it), but they all forbid agency fees. And 18 of the 20 weakest states restrict union revenue in some way, either by prohibiting agency fees (sixteen of them) or barring unions from automatically collecting dues from members' paychecks (Colorado and New Mexico). That's"}, {"section_title": "The scope of bargaining matters a lot", "text": "During those negotiations, the CTU insisted that no more than 30 percent of a teacher's evaluation be based on student scores, while CPS wanted 45 percent. When labor and management could not come to an agreement on evaluations, the teachers went on strike, which is legal under Illinois law. (Ostensibly, the walkout was over salaries, since technically teachers cannot strike over evaluations.) Facing intense pressure to resolve the dispute, CPS leaders agreed on 30 percent. But had the state defined and mandated evaluation criteria (rather than suggested it), not included evaluations within the scope of bargaining, and/or not given teachers the right to strike, CPS would likely have been able to impose its own standards. (Of course, whether 0 percent, 10 percent, 30 percent, or some other percentage is the \"right\" proportion allocated to student results has been, and continues to be, open to vigorous debate.) Contrast the Illinois situation with the present state of play in Wisconsin, where Act 10 limited collective bargaining to wage increases only. Existing legislation also banned teacher strikes in the Badger State and barred teacher evaluations from the scope of bargaining. That meant Wisconsin districts had the power unilaterally to impose higher health premium shares on employees, to shift pension contributions to workers, and to cut other personnel costs. In fact, raising eligibility for retiree health benefits and redesigning health plans-changes made possible by Governor Walker's reforms-was estimated to save Milwaukee Public Schools $117 million in 2012 alone. 19 (Subsequently, a Wisconsin judge struck down the limitations on bargaining; Walker has vowed to appeal.)"}, {"section_title": "4.", "text": "The fact that a state has mandatory, permissive or broad bargaining laws-or its unions enjoy abundant resources-does not mean that state policies are unionfavorable, and vice-versa. Many of the states in our top two tiers are home to state-level policies that are not particularly favorable to teacher unions. Take California, Illinois, and Minnesota (overall ranks: 6th, 8th, and 14th). They have the widest scopes of bargaining in the country. Sundry areas must be bargained, spanning salary and benefits to teacher evaluations to working conditions. Agency fees are allowed, and teachers are permitted to strike. Nearly all teachers are union members, and state unions there see some of the highest revenue in the nation. Yet, education policies in those same three states are less aligned with traditional union positions than in many other states (37th, 39th, and 46th, respectively). All of which goes to say, collective bargaining is far from the whole story when it comes to shaping education policy at the state level and the role of unions therein. Other factors-and players-obviously matter, too, often greatly, beginning with state leadership (past and present), federal policy, the condition of the economy, the influence of other key education stakeholders, and the state's own macropolitics. Why do some state unions (Pennsylvania, Minnesota, and Michigan) have what look like vital elements of power-bargaining is mandatory, agency fees are allowed, and union membership is high-yet fail to enjoy policy environments aligned with their interests (at least in this study's current snapshot)? How is it that state policies are so union-friendly in states like West Virginia and Kentucky, despite the fact that bargaining is permitted or prohibited and/ or agency fees banned? A closer look reveals an unsurprising insight. What did most of the \"should-beweak-but-aren't\" unions have in common? Democratic governors and legislative majorities. What did most of the \"shouldbe-strong-but-aren't\" unions share? Republican state leadership. Indeed the political climate can do much to constrain the influence of resource-rich unions and magnify the strength of those without ample resources of their own. The bottom line? Unions do not have carte blanche at the statehouse even if they do wield enormous influence over pay and working conditions on the ground. Historically, they were dominant voices in state-level debates over education because particular issues of enormous interest to them and their members were not high priorities for most other interest groups. 20 On other issues, teacher unions could easily find allies among other sectors of organized labor, thus adding to their clout. Moreover, elected state education board members (and local board members, too) typically gain office in low turnout elections that can be swayed relatively easily by organized groups with keen interest in who wins them. With the recent explosion of education reform advocacy groups, however, teacher unions now have more adversaries and rivals, and fewer automatic allies, in statehouse politics and policy decisions. 21,22 The venue is changing, too, as hardfought policies move from statehouse to schoolhouse. One recent study actually found that states with strong unions appeared more likely to pass teacher evaluation measures with union support, because their unions were confident they could shape the terms by which such programs would actually function. 23 Another focused on teacher performance pay and found that unions have just as much influence in the implementation phase of reform as they did in the design of the bill that eventually became law. In some cases, unions shaped proposals for merit pay so drastically that the resulting law was impossible to implement, and in other cases they undermined implementation such that the laws were reduced to token reforms. 24 For the future: This kind of research is hard-but more of it needs to be done. We found previous efforts to gauge teacher union strength to be in the ballpark, but imprecise. Most of the states we ranked on the \"stronger\" side of the distribution will come as no surprise to veteran observers of the education-policy wars. Most are known to be strongholds of union influence. Many are in the old industrial Northeast, and several others would be termed \"deep blue\" by political analysts. Similarly, the \"weak\" side of the distribution displays a lot of predictable states. But there are surprises, too. For those who tackle this complicated topic in the future, we suggest three improvements.* First, include indicators of a state's political climate: What is the party affiliation of the governor, legislators, and education leaders (e.g., the state superintendent, the members of state board of education), and how many were endorsed by the union? Second, mindful of the complexity and inconsistency of state election laws, it would be enormously valuable to obtain a complete accounting of the union's share of all types of political spending-not just donations, but also advertising, member mobilization, lobbying, and advocacy. Finally, a revised measure would account for political brick wallsprovisions of state constitutions (although in theory these can be amended); longstanding labor-friendly policies that may be regarded as sacred (although such cattle may be slaughtered); and seemingly permanent elements of a state's political culture (although these, too, may turn out to be malleable). Surely there are other methodological and data improvements to be made. We trust that readers won't be shy in sharing them with us."}, {"section_title": "Introduction Part IV: Taking a Closer Look-Teacher Union Influence Area", "text": "\n\n\n\n\nNote: As of this writing, collective bargaining nationwide was experiencing a high degree of unpredictability and, in some cases, volatility.

Hubbert, along with second-in-command Joe Reed, spearheaded the unification of the white and African American state teacher unions, fought to protect education funding against cuts from segregationist Governor George Wallace, and secured a living wage for school employees. In the process, he created one of the best-organized and funded state unions in the nation. 6 During the 2010 gubernatorial election, however, Hubbert and the AEA might have taken the state motto Audemus Jura Nostra Defendere (\"We Dare Defend Our Rights\") a bit too far. The Republican primary run-off that year pitted Bradley Byrne against Robert Bentley. Byrne was a former senator, former Alabama State Board of Education member, and former Democrat. 7 Bentley was a relatively unassuming two-term legislator who defeated the third-place candidate by only 200 votes to force the run-off. 8 The AEA usually stayed out of Republican politics-Hubbert was vice chairman of the Alabama Democratic Party, Reed its chair for minority affairs. But not this time. Over his long career, Byrne had clashed with the union over mandatory background checks for teachers and tenure reform, among other things. He was also blunt about his opinion of the AEA: \"I don't think AEA stands for the best of their profession. AEA stands for the worst of it,\" he once said at a news conference. \"\u2026Over my time as a board member I learned more and more about their control not just over education issues, but over business taxation issues, economic development issues and even blocking certain types of ethics reform.\" 9 But during the primary campaign, Byrne went further than public criticism-he spent $8 million on an advertising campaign against the AEA. Hubbert pounced. \"If Bradley Byrne had left us alone, we would have been only slightly involved in the governor's race,\" he said, \"\u2026[but instead] he threatened to burn our house down.\" 10 Thus, the AEA spent $3 million on advertising against Byrne and gave hundreds of thousands of dollars more to PACs which supported Bentley. 11 But voters reacted against Byrne's attacks on the respected union by resoundingly electing Bentley, who went on to defeat Democrat Ron Sparks-who also received contributions from the AEA-in the general election. In total, the union spent $8.6 million on the 2010 campaign. 12 Outgoing GOP Governor Bob Riley, a Byrne supporter, was livid, and made sure to get in a parting shot. In an unusual December 2010 session, he enlisted the newly-elected Republican legislature and passed a bill barring any public-employee union from automatically collecting dues from its members via payroll deductions-teacher unions included. 13 Riley and his supporters said this measure would curtail undue lobbying influence. 14 The AEA described the statute, and the $2.4 million a year that it stood to lose, as a \"mortal threat to our schools, our profession, and our association.\" 15 Not surprisingly, it sued the state, where federal courts are now deciding the matter. 16 That law, however, was only the first of several passed by Republicans, who are clearly enjoying their first majority in decades. Despite the efforts of the AEA, teachers saw their pay cut and their generous deferred-retirement plan killed. 17 When Hubbert and Reed both retired in 2011, the AEA's future seemed even more uncertain. \"We were staring down the barrel of a loaded cannon,\" said Gregory Graves, the AEA's new second-in-command. 18 But financially savvy Executive Director Henry Mabry surprised everyone in 2012. He and the AEA vigorously opposed a bill to legalize charter schools, which the Senate subsequently voted down. This was the third such failed attempt since 1999, and Governor Bentley indicated he would not push for round four. 19,20 And with AEA support, lawmakers preserved teacher jobs (even though state revenue decreased), saved teacher tenure (against pressure to eliminate it), and blocked the use of student achievement data in layoff decisions (despite a host of similar bills in neighboring states). 21,22,23 Given these recent successes, and with Mabry at the helm and Bentley in the governor's office, it looks like 2011 was only a bump in the road for the AEA. b Where possible, we report a state's rank as compared to other states on a given metric.

Traditionally a Republican state, the Alaskan State Department of Education decided to opt out of the Race to the Top competition in 2010. Education Commissioner Larry LeDoux explained, \"Alaska has the right to be suspicious of an initiative where we hand over authority.\" 5 Alaska is also one of just five states that did not adopt the Common Core State Standards, preferring to let districts decide their own academic standards. 6 And in 2012, Alaska received a waiver from No Child Left Behind, which for one year will freeze the increasing proficiency levels required by federal law. Education leaders argued that the law is too rigid; applying its urban-centric philosophies to Alaska is \"just illogical\" said Les Morse, the Deputy Education Commissioner. 7 State leaders will use the breathing room to further exercise their autonomy: \"At the same time we're doing this freeze, we're also putting together an application for a comprehensive waiver in which the state would implement its own accountability system,\" said Eric Fry, spokesperson for the Alaska Department of Education, \"so it wouldn't make sense to run the schools and districts through another year of the old NCLB when we're going to be changing things pretty soon.\" 8 With state leaders not pushing very hard for controversial reforms, the teacher unions have little to argue about. And with an abundance of natural resources, Alaska has witnessed fewer of the recession-tinged budgetary issues plaguing most of the country. 9 (Still, NEA-Alaska president Barb Angaiak noted, \"The slight increase of just over 1 percent [in education funding for the 2012 fiscal year] is not acceptable in light of increased operational costs.\") 10 The state has witnessed significant conflict over just one issue: pensions. The mandatory shift in 2005 away from a defined-benefit to a defined-contribution pension plan for all state workers (including teachers) provoked six years of union efforts to reverse the law. 11 In April 2012, the union's push to let teachers choose between the two options was nearly successful, as SB 121 passed in the Senate before dying in the House. 12 NEA-Alaska may get another chance: a new appointee to the Alaska Retirement Management board announced in July 2012 that he supports a return to the defined-benefit system. 13 With little else to fight about, however, for now it's pretty quiet on the Last Frontier. b Where possible, we report a state's rank as compared to other states on a given metric.

For the Arizona Education Association (AEA), \"strength in numbers\" seems like an appropriate mantra. One example of joining forces: The AEA supported Republican Governor Jan Brewer's Proposition 100-a temporary increase in sales tax to help finance education-and put its money where its mouth was by donating to the campaign and raising additional funds on the initiative's behalf. The AEA acknowledged that it was \"quite unusual\" for it to support a Republican-led proposal, but its appetite for funding made for a temporary truce. 4 With the short-term tax increase about to expire, the union aligned with numerous other groups-including education advocates, business alliances, and state Democrats-to support an initiative on the November 2012 ballot to make Proposition 100 permanent (and the courts have twice-thwarted opponents' attempts to stop the initiative before the vote). 5,6 The tax increase isn't the only time other organizations, and the courts, gave the AEA a hand. The union couldn't stop lawmakers from increasing employee pension contributions, but it supported a lawsuit filed by the Arizona State Retirement System citing the state breached its contract with retirees. Before the suit went to court, the legislature not only passed a bill returning to the old rate but also refunded the money back to the teachers, and the AEA celebrated. 7 The union also won an injunction against a 2011 statute that would have stopped unions from deducting dues from members' paychecks without annual authorization, if that money were to be used for political purposes. Adamant that this law inhibited free speech, AEA President Andrew Morrill declared \"our voice for quality public schools will not be silenced.\" 8 But Brewer and fellow Republicans may do more than silence the union voice-they may well destroy it. If SB 1485, proposed in early 2012, passes, it will prohibit all public employees from unionizing with a law even more devastating than the one recently passed in Wisconsin (which only limited the scope of bargaining). 9 The bill is currently tabled until the Senate reopens in 2013.

But the AEA failed to advance legislation that would have added yet another way for teachers and staff to appeal disciplinary actions and performance reviews. 9 And despite union opposition, Arkansas increased the cap on the number of charter schools.

Noting that the first application was not endorsed by the unions in 74 percent of California districts (including six of the state's largest ten), one reviewer stated that \"the lack of union buy-in at this stage raises serious concerns about the ability of the State to implement the Race to the Top reforms.\" 8 The California Federation of Teachers president Marty Hittleman reacted positively: \"These ideas [in the new bills] will create more harm than good. Now at least California will not be the guinea pig for these misguided proposals.\" 9 Rather than try again, pro-labor Governor Jerry Brown shelved RTTT and turned his attention to the state's impending financial crisis. At first, union interests seemed safe: In June 2011, legislators passed a last-minute bill that prohibited teacher layoffs during the 2011-12 school year. 10 Then Brown announced the bad news: California had anticipated a 2011 revenue increase of $4 billion but might fall an astounding $3.7 billion short. If the projections became reality, public education would share in $2 billion of automatic cuts. State unions and their local affiliates rallied, and by year's end, K-12 districts (and their teachers) could breathe a sigh of relief-they would see only $330 million in cuts, most of which would come from transportation. 11 To the chagrin of education advocates, however, Brown now threatens to slash nearly $5 billion from K-12 education if voters don't pass his November 2012 initiative to increase sales tax and income tax for the wealthy.

Every day, Connecticut's teachers do far more than show up.\" 7 Despite his reversal, however, unions seized upon the gaffe to paint Malloy as out-of-touch and anti-teacher, and the education reform bill passed by the legislature in May 2012 lacked many of his original proposals, including provisions to make tenure rules more stringent, link teacher evaluations with pay and certification, and strip teachers in the lowest-performing schools of many rights guaranteed by collective bargaining. 8 On the other hand, the reform bill did redesign the teacher evaluation system: While evaluations will not have a significant impact on teacher job security (a major union victory), student performance will count for 45 percent of a teacher's ratingchanges also endorsed by the governor. 9 And teacher tenure must be \"informed by\" the results of the evaluations.

IMPACT was the first such system to be implemented in the country, and although the WTU grudgingly agreed to it, the union did not have much of a choice since evaluations are strictly within the purview of DCPS management. Union leaders contended that it was implemented prematurely and was unreliable, punitive, and based on a false premise: that student test scores accurately measure teacher ability and only teacher ability (as opposed to conditions outside the classroom). 6 \"The scores don't reflect the existing conditions that students bring into the classrooms, issues pertaining to family dysfunction, economic circumstance, poverty,\" said WTU president Nathan Saunders. 7 But the union had no actual say over evaluation and dismissal rules, and consequently, the results of IMPACT led to the termination of 542 teachers for poor performance between 2010 and 2012. 8,9 On the other hand, D.C. also ranked 988 of its approximately 4,100 teachers \"highly effective\" in 2012, making them eligible for bonuses of up to $25,000-which have so far been funded by outside donors but, as of 2013, will be paid for from the district's pocket. 10 Unlike teacher evaluations and dismissals, performance pay is a part of the collective-bargaining agreement-and was the subject of a high-profile and prolonged round of contract negotiations that was finally resolved in April 2010 with the help of AFT president Randi Weingarten. When Henderson took over from Rhee as chancellor of DCPS, WTU leaders pressed to de-emphasize the role of standardized testing in the IMPACT metric. 11 Beginning in 2013, student achievement will still be half of a teacher's evaluation, but standardized test scores will be just one part of that score (35 percent of the total evaluation, down from 50 percent); teacherdeveloped assessments of student learning will make up the rest (15 percent of the total). Henderson explained that the change was \"in response to feedback from teachers,\" and she clarified that \"while we believe strongly that value-added is the fairest and most accurate method of capturing a teacher's impact on student achievement, we recognize that this measure does not reflect everything your students have learned.\" 12 The WTU applauded the move. 13 In another successful campaign, the WTU ensured that the District made good on its obligations to teachers who had their positions eliminated due to budget cutbacks and declining enrollments. A provision in the 2010 collective bargaining agreement specified that those \"excessed\" teachers with good evaluations and twenty years of service were eligible for early retirement with full benefits. When first asked to hand over the funds to carry out this provision, the District said it lacked the money. 14 WTU then accused the District of questionable accounting; the District replied that the union had not filed the necessary paperwork; but by May 2012, they had come to agreement, announcing that the District will allocate $10.2 million over the next five years to fund these benefits. 15 Politics appear to be alive and well in the nation's capital.

Second, the NCES cautions against comparing the District of Columbia to other states because it has only one school district, and therefore per-pupil expenditures (and allocations for salaries and benefits as compared to other operating expenses) are not similar to those in other states. Third, per-pupil spending in urban districts tends to be considerably higher than non-urban districts in the same, but D.C. does not see its high expenditures averaged with lower ones from non-urban districts.

That law was overturned in circuit court in March 2012, but the FEA will have to wait until the end of the year, or beyond, for the state supreme court to make a final decision. 10 With no allies in the Republican-led governor's office and legislature, the FEA again turned to the courts.

Voters will decide on the issue in November 2012, but so far the union has limited its activities to issuing press releases and fundraising. 8 The charter conflict began in 2009 when the legislature established the Georgia Charter Schools Commission and granted it power to approve and fund new charters, just as local districts could. 9 In May 2011, however, the Georgia Supreme Court held that the Commission violated the constitutionally protected authority of local districts and revoked the charters of the seventeen Commission-authorized schools (out of a total of 127 charters in the state), affecting 16,000 students. 10 Proreform lawmakers responded with the pending constitutional amendment, which drove a rift between Governor Nathan Deal, who supports it, and State Superintendent John Barge, a former rural superintendent who broke with fellow Republicans to come out staunchly against it. Barge stated that the amendment is unnecessary, redundant, and would cost district schools $430 million over the next five years: \"Until all of our public school students are in school for a full 180-day school year, until essential services like student transportation and student support can return to effective levels, and until teachers regain jobs with full pay for a full school year, we should not redirect one more dollar away from Georgia's local school districts.\" 11 The GAE applauded Barge, stating, \"His announcement shows he fully understands the negative ramifications for our public school children.\" 12 September 2012 polls show voters are divided: half support the amendment, one-quarter oppose it, and one-quarter are undecided. To date, the GAE hasn't begun advertising or otherwise campaigning in earnest. 13 Given that Deal's endorsement helped two candidates narrowly win their tight primary races in August, and that teacher unions are embroiled in a publicrelations nightmare (despite negative public opinion statewide, the GAE and AFT publicly defended the rights of 178 Atlanta teachers caught in the biggest testing scandal in history), the union could find it has little support from voters come November. 14,15 WINNERS NEVER CHEAT, CHEATERS NEVER WIN b Where possible, we report a state's rank as compared to other states on a given metric.

In 2003, the state legislature created the Recovery School District, paving the way for rapid charter school growth. 5 Louisiana charters are automatically exempt from nearly every state education policy, and in 2010 the legislature passed Governor Bobby Jindal's Red Tape Reduction Act, which allowed traditional districts to ask for waivers from the laws as well. (The Louisiana Federation of Teachers tried, but failed, to stop the Act in the state supreme court.) 6 The state also recently enacted bills supporting home schooling, permitting (and paying for) students to take courses online if they are dissatisfied with what is offered at their local school, expanding the number of charter school authorizers, and creating a \"parent trigger\" mechanism. 7,8 But no choice policy has received as much attention as Louisiana's voucher programs. In 2008, the state offered vouchers for private school tuition to students in the Recovery School District, and also allowed individuals to claim private school tuition as a tax deduction (a rarity among the states). Two years later, lawmakers extended the voucher program to include special education students across the state, and in 2012 they enacted tax rebates for donors to school tuition organizations, which in turn provide private school scholarships. 9 But when in 2012 the legislature passed Jindal's proposal to expand the voucher program to students statewide, and not just those in low-income families, the already-infuriated unions had had enough. The Louisiana Association of Educators (LAE) and the Louisiana Federation of Teachers (LFT) sued, calling the program an unconstitutional use of taxpayer money to fund private institutions. LFT President Steve Monaghan accused Jindal of using the voucher program as a vehicle to further everyone's interests except the students': \"If this administration cared as much about children as it does about satisfying corporate donors and national political ambitions, it would concentrate on improving all our schools for all our children.\" 10 Jindal responded forcefully: \"The coalition of the status quo have fought reform every step of the way, so it is no surprise they are making this last ditch effort to convince the courts to overrule the vote of the people and the Legislature. Holding up these reforms in court will only deny parents and students the opportunity to escape failing schools. Our kids do not get a second chance to grow up.\" 11 In August 2012, the Louisiana Supreme Court denied an injunction to suspend the voucher program while awaiting a trial on its constitutionality, scheduled for October 2012 (post-press time for us, unfortunately). The LFT expressed disappointment and vowed it would keep fighting the law (and that it would rally to change the \"sham\" accountability standards for private schools in the meantime). 12 The LAE went further, threatening to sue any private school that accepted state voucher money. An angry Jindal declared that \"union leaders are stooping to new lows and trying to strong-arm schools to keep our kids from getting a quality education.\" 13 As yet, however, the state is going forward with the program and the LAE's threat remains empty.

Districts may decide their own standards for layoffs (with no requirement that teacher performance be included), and there are no articulated consequences for unsatisfactory evaluations. Further, when we calculated our metric, the state did not require that student achievement factor into teacher evaluations.

Nor does it exempt charter schools from state teacher certification requirements or district collective bargaining agreements.

The group wanted to replace seniority with teacher performance as the primary factor in layoff decisions; rather than wait for lawmakers to take the lead, it gathered enough signatures in late 2011 to place the issue on the November 2012 ballot. 6 The Massachusetts Teachers Association (MTA) reacted fiercely, basing its objections on the fact that the state's teacher evaluation system had not yet been implemented, let alone tested.

That 2011 statute gives the State Superintendent of Public Instruction and the governor the authority to intervene in governmental bodies facing bankruptcy, school districts included. In such districts, they can appoint an \"emergency district manager\" to control finances, which includes the right to eliminate or modify an existing union contract. 9 By early 2012, the Detroit and Highland Park school districts had emergency managers at the helm, and they did not shy away from making cuts. 10 For example, faced with an $86.3 million deficit, Roy Roberts, the emergency manager for Detroit, unilaterally imposed a 10 percent wage cut on employees and increased employee contributions to their health benefits plan to 20 percent. 11 He converted low-performing schools into charters, closed others, and placed some in a new state-wide district-saving $7.5 million in annual operating costs along the way. 12 Labor may yet have the last word, however.

But against heavy lobbying from the state's labor unions, the amendment never got off the ground (although the idea itself still has supporters in both the House and Senate). 8 When it comes to the budget, however, Dayton takes less of a pro-union hard line. In an attempt to pave the way for later bipartisan compromise on the 2011 budget, he signed a Republican-backed (and union-opposed) bill that authorized alternative licensure options for nontraditional and mid-career teachers. 9 But no such compromise resulted, and to break a budget deadlock and a twenty-day government shutdown, Dayton agreed to Republican demands and took tax increases for the wealthy and for corporations completely off the table (despite the contributions of Education Minnesota, the state's NEA-AFT affiliate, which helped fund a $1 million campaign in support of Dayton's original plan). 10,11 Without the revenue from tax increases, and to the immense frustration of education leaders, the state delayed already-overdue payments to school districts. 12 And it looks like lawmakers aren't done with licensure yet either; in 2012 they enacted a bill that requires more stringent testing for new teachers.

When the state passed legislation in 2010 guaranteeing that it would implement a statewide high-quality teacher evaluation system as part of its $700 million Race to the Top application, Governor Andrew Cuomo had no idea that it would take education leaders so long to work out the details. But after more than two years, and with millions of dollars at risk, the New York State United Teachers (NYSUT) and state education officials had yet to agree on what those evaluations would look like. So Cuomo gave them a deadline, and an ultimatum: Decide, or else he would decide for them. 5 After an all-night negotiating session, New York had new teacher evaluations: 40 percent of a teacher's score would be based on student achievement (measured at least in part by growth on state standardized tests), and 60 percent on classroom observations and other subjective measures. 6 Cuomo called the agreement \"a victory for all New Yorkers\" and NYSUT President Richard Iannuzzi conceded (or simply put on a brave face) when he said it is \"good for students and fair to teachers.\" 7 Iannuzzi's comments were a stark contrast to those he made less than a year earlier when the state board initially proposed increasing the role of state test scores from the previously-mandated 20 percent to up to 40 percent: \"[the Board] chose politics over sound educational policy and the cheap way over the right way, doubling down on high-stakes tests of dubious worth.\" 8 Perhaps Cuomo's ultimatum changed his mind, or perhaps Iannuzzi didn't want to be left holding the bag if the state, and its teachers, lost their RTTT award. Not a week after the agreement, New York City Mayor Bloomberg released the performance rankings of 18,000 individual teachers (the city had been using value-added evaluations for four years). NYC's United Federation of Teachers (UFT) had tried legal avenues to block the disclosure, but to no avail, and now everyone in the city, and the nation, could see teachers' names and ratings in the Wall Street Journal. 9 Outraged, the UFT turned to state lawmakers and Cuomo, pressing for legislation to protect its members' privacy. The NYSUT joined the fray, calling the release \"a betrayal of the essential purpose of evaluations\" and worrying that publicizing the ratings would undermine the new statewide system; 10 even Bill Gates wrote in a New York Times editorial that \"the surest way to weaken [evaluations] is to twist it into a capricious exercise in public shaming.\" 11 The result: Cuomo proposed a bill that allowed parents to see individual teachers' rankings but blocked districts from releasing that information to the public-although the measure would not stop parents from sharing the scores themselves. Bloomberg opposed the bill outright, while the NYSUT wanted even stricter privacy measures; in the end, each took what they could get as lawmakers overwhelmingly approved the measure. \"I'm glad it's over,\" said Iannuzzi. 12 Considering the amount of time state leaders and the union have spent debating the evaluations, so is everybody else. b Where possible, we report a state's rank as compared to other states on a given metric.

Jennifer Weiss denounced as a \"smackdown on teachers\"), which prevents the teacher association from collecting dues from its own members via automatic payroll deductions. 8 Democrat lawmakers and the NCAE called the bill revenge for their heavy criticism of GOP-initiated education-funding cuts. Perdue vetoed the measure. 9 But at 1:00 a.m. just a few days into 2012, Republicans overrode her veto. Despite the ensuing outcry from Democrats, who called the move \"vindictive\" and \"insane\"-and from the governor, who termed it an \"unprecedented, unconstitutional power grab\"-the law stood. 10 That fractious cycle portended further confrontation between Perdue on one side and the GOP-controlled legislature on the other, with the NCAE caught in the middle. Early in 2012, the legislature passed a budget that Perdue subsequently vetoed, worried that it did not provide sufficient funds for public education. 11 It was the second year in a row that the governor vetoed the state budget, and the second year in a row that the legislature overrode her veto. 12 In addition to cutting funding for education, the new budget contained another potential hit for teacher associations: a modified version of SB 795, the Excellent Public Schools Act. The original version would have introduced merit pay for teachers and an A-F rating system for schools, created a new K-3 literacy program, and overhauled tenure so that all teachers would be placed on one-year contracts and only after three or more of those could qualify for multi-year (but not more than four-year) contracts. 13 But while some of the less controversial components of the bill (such as the school rating guidelines and the literacy program) made it through to the final version, after intense NCAE lobbying, hot-button issues like merit pay and tenure reform did not. 14,15 Despite this partial victory, however, the momentum seems to be against the NCAE, and Perdue isn't seeking re-election (she cited concerns that she was politicizing education policy, although her unpopularity in the traditionally Republican state made re-election an unlikely possibility). 16 HIDING BEHIND THE APRON b Where possible, we report a state's rank as compared to other states on a given metric.

In June 2012, it helped defeat a ballot initiative that would have eliminated local property taxes (and the resulting dollars for education); the initiative was proposed by a conservative group that deemed such taxes unnecessary given the state's budget surpluses. With over 70 percent of voters siding with the coalition of unions and local interests that opposed the measure, it was easily voted down. 11 The following month, the NDEA lent its support to one of its local affiliates fighting for higher salaries and better housing opportunities for teachers in a district where an oil boom pushed average wages to $80,000 per year, but a starting teacher's salary can be as low as $31,000. 12 NDEA President Dakota Draper used the opportunity to call out lawmakers who have yet to decide \"how much [money to give education], where it will come from and who will pay for it.\" 13 But with no pressure from leaders to change the state's education policies, and no impending fights over state dollars, for the moment all is peaceful in the Peace Garden State. \"PEACE GARDEN STATE\" SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT b Where possible, we report a state's rank as compared to other states on a given metric.

Originally passed in the same month that Wisconsin stripped collective bargaining rights from its public-sector employees (March 2011), SB 5 prohibited public-sector strikes, eliminated binding arbitration for employee-management disputes, and drastically narrowed the scope of collective bargaining. 5 In one of the most expensive campaigns ever waged over a state ballot initiative, teacher unions (both state and national) joined forces with the influential police and fire fighter associations, and the highly organized (and well-funded) political action group We Are Ohio. The Ohio Education Association (OEA), Ohio Federation of Teachers (OFT), and National Education Association (NEA) contributed some $7 million to the successful campaign to repeal the law. 6,7 AFT President Randi Weingarten boasted after the vote, \"Those who would dare try to strip collective bargaining rights away from hard-working citizens will now think twice\"; OEA President Patricia Frost-Brooks chimed in, declaring that \"Ohioans refused to turn their backs on the people who guard our safety and teach our children.\" 8,9 But it's not the same when the OEA and OFT do not have their heavyweight interest group allies. For example, the biennial budget passed in 2011, as originally proposed by the governor (covering school years 2011-13) contained many provisions in the same spirit as SB 5. After three months of wrangling among the House, Senate, and governor, the version that passed omitted the language that would have barred collective bargaining over salaries and would have increased employee pension contributions. Still the OEA was not happy: \"Despite these victories in the substitute bill, a number of changes to the bill represent significant steps backwards,\" reported the union to its members. 10 Among other items, the OEA objected to provisions opening the door to performance pay, reducing tenure protections, and requiring that half of a teacher's evaluation be based on student growth as measured by standardized test scores. They were furious, too, when, a year later, lawmakers proposed that evaluations be removed from the scope of collective bargaining entirely. OEA Director of Education Policy Randy Flora argued to the House Education Committee that \"the best teacher evaluation systems are those created collaboratively through the [local] collective bargaining process.\" 11 But once again, it could not stop the bill from becoming law, and evaluations are now entirely off the bargaining table. Perhaps the OEA might learn from the OFT that resisting reform is not the best strategy in Ohio. During the budget debate, OFT staff did not object to the state's evaluation mandates: \"Those are things we pretty much agreed make a teacher a good, solid teacher,\" commented OFT leader Deb Tully. 12 The OFT even supported elements of Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson's reform plan, which, among other provisions, ties pay to teacher (and student) performance, eliminates seniority as a primary determinant for transfers and assignments, and allows the district to circumvent the union contract when intervening in failing schools. Its most vociferous objections pertained to \"the precedent of local levy money going to support charter schools,\" said OFT president Melissa Cropper. 13,14 It appears that Ohio unions must choose their battles carefully."}, {"section_title": "MONEY TALKS OVERALL 12TH", "text": "Ohio's teacher unions are fairly influential compared with those in all states, and are the most influential among the bargaining-permitted states.

Todd Thomsen, who then asked fellow representatives during the hearing for the bill, \"Can you name one thing the legislature has done for teachers' best interest?\" 8 Lawmakers may have been considering those teacher interests instead of the best interests of the students when SB 1530 died in House committee. One superintendent pointed out the negative consequences of the defeat: \"[My district] receives about $30,000 for textbooks...I would rather spend this money on technology and use online books that are a small fraction of the cost\"-a sensible solution that would have been possible under SB 1530. 9 In the wake of this fight, however, the OEA found its image tarnished (a problem made more urgent by the fact that it was losing membership due both to the new bargaining law and to net teacher job losses). 10,11 The union began a massive \"Stand Up for Public Education\" campaign, aimed at improving the unions' own public image, preserving the rights of teachers, and increasing funding for the traditional education system.

Osmond explained that his (as-yet unwritten) plan would eliminate tenure and make all employees \"at-will,\" limit the scope of bargaining to salaries and benefits (and force all negotiations to occur in public), eliminate due process protections from state law, and require that 25 percent of teachers' base salary be contingent on their performance. But Osmond then took an unprecedented step: he asked educators for feedback on his ideas. First, he toured schools around the state. Then, he sat down with the UEA, representatives of the state school boards and superintendents associations, and state education leaders to design the actual policy that he would propose to the legislature. 7 \"For the first time that I can remember, UEA was at the table and an integral partner in the creation of a major reform bill,\" said Gallagher-Fishbaugh, \"\u2026[and] being part of the process allowed us to focus on student learning while protecting teacher rights.\" 8 And protect those rights they did: teachers kept tenure, bargaining, due process, and their seniority-based salary schedule. As passed, the bill did require that evaluations include (yet-to-be-specified) measures of student growth but allowed districts to develop their own evaluation systems. Teachers would lose their automatic yearly pay increases if they received poor evaluations, but they would not be eligible for immediate dismissal either (instead they first go through remediation). Administrators, not teachers, would see their base salaries affected by poor evaluations. 9 And if that weren't enough, lawmakers' enthusiasm for this bill consigned other union-opposed bills-student-based \"backpack\" funding, vouchers, performance pay, the elimination of automatic payroll deductions, and more restrictions on collective bargaining-to failure. 10,11 The media heralded Osmond as a \"courageous lawmaker,\" the state superintendent called the bill \"a step forward,\" and Senate President Michael Waddoups heralded the compromise as \"a great kumbaya moment.\" 12,13 Others were skeptical-including Senator Stuart Adams, who worried that the union voice dominated discussions-but their criticism went unheard amidst the accolades showered on Osmond. 14 In the end, it was unclear whether Osmond had experienced a true change of heart or whether he determined that a political turnaround was in his best interests.

You don't have a teacher evaluation system that is tied into student outcomes, you lose points.\" 5 Rather than pass a charter law or change its evaluation system, Vermont did not apply (although in a letter to Duncan, Vilaseca attributed the choice to RTTT's seeming bias against rural states, critically noting that \"based on the culture and demographics of our communities, some states [like Vermont] may take a different approach to accomplishing the same goals of ensuring each student is given the education they need to thrive in the 21st century.\") 6 That same year, lawmakers and the Vermont-NEA agreed on a pension plan that saved the state $15 million per year-after considerable horse trading. \"What we've all produced is better: teachers working a bit longer, paying a bit more, but getting more when they retire,\" says Vermont-NEA president Martha Allen. 7 Vermont's \"thanks but no thanks\" attitude to RTTT persisted when, in June 2012, the state board rescinded its NCLB waiver application, citing heavy constraints-especially the requirement that teacher evaluations be tied to yearly test results. \"We feel it should be left up to districts as to how much they want to do that and make sure they have multiple indicators,\" said Allen. 8 John Fischer, deputy commissioner of the Vermont Department of Education, also expressed confidence in Vermont schools and the seeming irrelevance of waivers: \"Generally, in Vermont, we've got great schools. We [are] looking at a continuous improvement cycle, not turning around failing schools.\" 9 While it is true that student performance rankings consistently put Vermont near the top of the country, it's also true that their students are some of the more advantaged in the land. 10,11 IF IT AIN'T BROKE\u2026 To what extent, from totally in line to not at all in line, were state education policies proposed by the governor during your state's latest legislative session in line with teacher-union priorities?"}, {"section_title": "22", "text": "Overall Rank: 11th Tier 2 (Strong) VERMONT ENDNOTES 1 A state's overall rank is calculated as follows: First, we score it on multiple sub-indicators (sub-indicator data and scores for Vermont are shown in the table, Vermont Rankings by Area and Indicator).

In each area, we use that average to place the states in rank order: For example, in Area 1: Resources and Membership, Vermont is ranked 6th of 51 based on the weighted average of its sub-indicators.

Its weak charter laws are as union-friendly as its employment policies: While there is no cap on the number of charters, only local school boards may authorize them and-perhaps as a resultthere is little charter activity in the state.

Nor could it defeat a revised pension plan requiring all teachers to pay into the retirement system despite a recent reduction in benefits for new teachers (but the measure also required that teachers get raises to offset the increased contributions-and that local districts should foot the bill). 7 But the VEA claimed victory when a bill died in committee that would have allowed state funding to follow the child into virtual schools. Furthermore, Virginia's teacher evaluation guidelines are much less stringent than in other states: When initially passed in 2011, they recommended (but did not require) that only 40 percent of a teacher's rating be based on student achievement as determined by \"multiple measures,\" not necessarily just standardized test scores. 8 The 40 percent became mandatory only after the weak evaluations put the state's NCLB waiver request in danger, with the Department of Education expressing concern that \"because the weightings [for Student Academic Progress] are determined locally, it will likely produce a fragmented system that will have limited impact on student learning\u2026 [and] it can easily be watered down.\" 9 Finally, in early 2012, the VEA helped defeat HB 576, which threatened teacher job security. Proposed by Republican Governor Robert F. McDonnell as a way to root out ineffective teachers, that bill would have extended the probationary period for new teachers from three to five years, replaced permanent contracts with ones that administrators would decide whether to renew (or not) every three years, and removed the requirement for pre-dismissal improvement plans and appeal procedures for subpar teachers. 10 The VEA felt the bill gave administrators far too much power and left teachers defenseless against arbitrary firing. When the measure failed in the senate, VEA lobbyist Robley Jones breathed a little easier: \"We're very, very relieved. What was proposed was just overkill.\" 11 Governor McDonnell called the vote a \"disappointing\" rejection of a \"bipartisan, national movement underway to bring more accountability to our schools,\" foreshadowing, \"Today's vote is a delay. It is not a defeat.\" 12 As yet, McDonnell's hopes for improvements to the state's teacher employment policies remain unfulfilled.

Washington is one of twenty-one states that both require collective bargaining and allow unions to automatically collect agency fees, a key source of revenue, from non-members.

But public-safety unions such as those for police and firefighters were exempt, which ultimately proved to be the law's undoing. 5 The Wisconsin Education Association Council (WEAC) filed a lawsuit against the ban on payroll deductions and the recertification requirement, asserting that it violated workers' equal-protection rights and their First Amendment right to organize. In March 2012, a federal judge agreed that teachers were being unfairly singled out-noting that the unions receiving exemptions were those that had endorsed Walker in 2010-and removed both provisions from the law. 6 The ruling came just in time: twenty-eight local teacher unions were about to lose their bargaining status because they fell short of the required approval from the majority of bargaining-unit members. 7,8 In spite of the court's decision, however, in the fifteen months since Act 10 passed, the AFT-Wisconsin lost 6,000 of its 17,000 members; the NEAaffiliated WEAC refused to comment on its losses. 9 Organized labor also sued to stop Act 10's bargaining limitations, asserting that it unfairly singled out unionized publicsector workers and violated the \"home rule\" charter of the Wisconsin constitution that bans the state from imposing pension contribution rates on Milwaukee city workers.
