[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Small islands are likely to be disproportionately impacted by climate change-related stressors, as their high reef-to-land area and heavy dependence on shallow marine ecosystems increase their vulnerability to the decline and loss of these ecosystems. Many such islands have experienced gradual declines in health, diversity, and productivity in recent decades, principally from local anthropogenic stressors. However, recent climate change-related shifts in sea surface temperature have added a global stressor to this list, with sudden and devastating consequences in some areas. The U.S. Territory of Guam (13\u00b028 0 N, 144\u00b046 0 E), the southernmost island in the Mariana Archipelago, lies just outside the Indo-Pacific center of reef biodiversity (Roberts et al. 2002) and hosts approximately 350 species of shallow-water scleractinian corals (Randall 2003). Like many small islands in the tropical Pacific, the condition of Guam's coral reefs has gradually declined since the 1960s from repeated Acanthaster planci outbreaks, worsening water quality, and high fishing pressure from a growing population (Chesher 1969;Randall and Holloman 1974;Colgan 1987;Burdick et al. 2008;Caballes 2009;McNeil et al. 2015). The recent superimposition of warming sea surface temperatures and other unpredicted stressors onto these already stressed communities had devastating effects on Guam's reefs. These events triggered an evaluation of our current approach to reef management and conservation, and highlighted an urgent need to develop a strategy for coping with climate-related change. Our experiences, and the evaluation of our response strategy, provide important documentation of climate change impacts to small island ecosystems. Prior to 2013, coral reefs in Guam had been mildly affected by anomalous sea surface warming, relative to other sites in the Western Pacific. Paulay and Benayahu (1999) described the first recorded bleaching event in Guam in 1994 as affecting reefs island-wide but resulting in little mortality. While the authors did not believe the event was associated with unusually high sea surface temperatures at the time of the study, a later review of Pathfinder sea surface temperature measurements indicated that the bleaching threshold used for Guam for the period 1985-2003 (29.9\u00b0C) was exceeded in 1994 (Burdick et al. 2008). Birkeland et al. (2000) and Richmond et al. (2002) mentioned coral bleaching in association with the historic 1997-1998 El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event, but mortality was limited and the overall impact was considered mild compared to the significant impacts observed in nearby Palau (Bruno et al. 2001) and at other reef locations around world (Wilkinson 2000). Burdick et al. (2008) reported bleaching on Guam's reefs in 2006 and 2007, but mortality was limited primarily to Acropora along the reef margin. Although the frequency and severity of mass coral bleaching events on Guam's reefs has increased in recent decades, impacts were limited. However, a severe bleaching event in 2013, and subsequent events in 2014, 2016, and 2017, elevated concern among managers and researchers regarding the high potential for these events to drive a rapid and significant loss in coral cover, change in species composition, and decline in overall reef condition. Concern was also raised regarding the potential for the onset of near-annual frequency of heat stress events occurring earlier than had previously been predicted for the region (Donner et al. 2005;Donner 2009;van Hooidonk et al. 2016). In addition to the repeated heat stress events, a year-long ENSO-related period of extreme low tides began in late 2014 and extended into 2015, resulting in further coral mortality on Guam's shallow reef flat platforms. Here, we present summaries of these annual events, our assessment of the current state of reefs in Guam, and an analysis of the methods we utilized to respond to these events, which will be incorporated into future management protocols."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": "The severity, scale, and repetitive nature of these bleaching events necessitated the development of multiple survey approaches, to maximize the quality of data collected given limited time and resources. These surveys and our assessment of their utility are described in Table S1. An intensive, island-wide survey approach was formulated by the authors in 2013, based on qualitative reconnaissance assessments of a subset of sites where bleaching was first detected, and informed by a draft bleaching response plan previously developed by the Guam Bureau of Statistics and Plans (BSP) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries Guam Field Office, with support from the NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program. However, time and resources were not available to achieve the same scale of sampling effort for subsequent years, and thus, a scaleddown effort was adopted for a smaller number of sites during these events. Surveys were conducted by a team of managers and scientists from government agencies (BSP, NOAA Fisheries, Guam Environmental Protection Agency, National Parks Service) and academe (University of Guam). In addition, an existing reef flat long-term monitoring program tracked bleaching events at five monitored sites throughout the entire period. Shallow staghorn Acropora communities were particularly vulnerable and were initially spot surveyed for bleaching impacts in 2014, and later quantitatively surveyed for the extent of loss in 2014-2015 and again in 2017. In 2016, a rapid reef flat site assessment protocol was developed and tested for ''canary sites''-those sites intended to serve as part of an early warning system to guide decisions on further actions. Figure 1 provides the locations along the coast of Guam where these different surveys were conducted. Prevalence of bleaching and bleaching mortality were calculated for all species encountered in these surveys as: # of colonies or % of coral cover with bleaching or bleaching mortality # of colonies counted \u00c2 100 Coral Reefs"}, {"section_title": "123", "text": "Seaward slope surveys Shallow seaward slope surveys were undertaken in 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017 using generally the same protocols; details of modifications are described where appropriate. All sites were at approximately 5 m depth and included reef fronts of fringing platform reefs, shallow reaches of apron reefs, and shallow veneering communities at the cliff base along the northeastern coast; surveys did not include sheltered environments such as lagoons. Sites were located in the field using a handheld GPS receiver, and divers entered the water at a safe distance immediately seaward of the site and navigated to the target depth. Surveys were conducted along (n = 3) 25 m (2013 and 2015) or 30 m (2016 and 2017) transects placed along the target depth contour, clockwise around the island during all survey periods. Benthic photo-transect surveys were conducted using a compact point-and-shoot camera (Canon Pow-erShot SD940 IS in 2013, Canon PowerShot S120 in 2015, and Sony Cybershot RX100 in 2016 and 2017) to obtain an image every meter along each transect at 1 m above the substrate. Semiquantitative coral community bleaching assessments carried out in 2017 were conducted by one diver (either DB or LJR) swimming off-transect (in the general vicinity) for 20 min and recording the bleaching condition of each haphazardly encountered coral. Corals were identified to the lowest taxon possible and scored according to the following bleaching severity categories: normal (normal pigmentation), partial colony paling (such as on surfaces directly exposed to insolation), whole colony paling, partial bleaching (on surfaces directly exposed to insolation), whole colony bleaching, partial bleaching-associated mortality (on surfaces directly exposed to insolation), and whole colony bleaching-associated mortality. These in situ observations were augmented by photo-documentation of additional colonies not assessed on-site; bleaching condition was assessed from these photographs using the same categories presented above and combined with the in situ observations into a single database. In 2013, benthic photo-transect surveys were carried out between October and December at 46 sites around Guam in response to observations of bleaching at multiple sites around the island in August. Forty-one of these sites were among the 52 sites visited during a NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) reef fish community assessment in 2011 (see Williams et al. 2012). The NOAA PIFSC sites were generated using a depth-stratified random sampling design. We located these sites using waypoints provided by NOAA PIFSC, keeping our survey sites to 5 m depth. The locations of seven additional sites were randomly generated along the northeast coast using ArcGIS, as the NOAA PIFSC surveys underrepresented this portion of the coastline. In 2015, benthic photo-transect surveys were carried out between June and September at a randomized subset (n = 17) of the 2013 survey sites. The objective of these surveys was to assess cumulative impacts of 2013 and 2014, and to establish a new baseline of coral cover, species composition, and condition against which recovery or future impacts could be measured. Coral quadrat surveys were conducted along the same transects as the benthic photo-transect surveys, to assess the size and condition of coral colonies within (n = 6) 0.25 m 2 quadrats placed every 5 m along each transect. Colony size was visually estimated and binned (B 10 cm, 11-30 cm, 31-60 cm, 61-100 cm, 101-200 cm, [ 200 cm). Health impacts were recorded and the percentage of colony affected was estimated. Partial and full-colony mortality were assessed and ascribed to bleaching-associated mortality from the 2013 and 2014 events based on expert assessment of the pattern and estimated timing of the mortality. Partial mortality was characterized as low (B 10%), medium (10-50%), or high ([ 50%). Benthic photo-transects were carried out at 20 sites around the island between July 2016 and January 2017, including 17 of the sites surveyed in 2013 and four new sites, in conjunction with a NOAA Saltonstall-Kennedy Grant-funded reef resilience assessment led by Dr. Jeffrey Maynard and DB. The resilience assessment sites were selected from the 2013 bleaching assessment sites in a nonrandom manner to achieve an even distribution of sites around the island, with priority placed on those sites that had been surveyed in both 2013 and 2015. Persistent poor water conditions prevented surveys at five of the sites along the east coast. In 2017, benthic photo-transect surveys and semiquantitative coral community bleaching assessments were carried out at 12 sites in October in response to observations of bleaching at multiple sites around the island. Several sites, including most sites on the windward eastern coast, could not be accessed due to hazardous water conditions. Images from photo-transect surveys were color-corrected using Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 6.0 and analyzed for percent cover using CPCe 4.1. The benthic feature at each randomly generated point (16 points per image) was identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level. Points that fell on a portion of a coral colony that exhibited nonnormal pigmentation or exhibited bleaching-associated mortality were classified as pale, bleached, or recently dead in order to generate estimates of the percent of bleachingimpacted coral cover.\nof the previous bleaching event. Nearshore staghorn Acropora communities were particularly affected, with LR and VB observing bleaching and associated mortality of A. muricata, A. cf. intermedia, and A. cf. pulchra between May and July; 62% of tagged Acropora cf. pulchra and A. cf. intermedia colonies were affected.\nestimated live cover of 21.3 ha, a loss of 36%. Recovery, via resheeting over dead skeleton or larval recruitment onto dead skeleton by other species, was observed in seven populations with extensive thickets, though only one staghorn recruit was seen in one site. Populations with high mortality subjected to physical disturbance (high wave energy or high human use) were reduced to rubble and showed no recovery.\ndecline in coral cover as a result of the 2013 and 2014 events was greatest at the eastern windward sites (-45%, from 29 \u00b1 13 to 16 \u00b1 7%, t(16) = 3.57, p = 0.003), while no significant difference in coral cover was detected at the western leeward sites over the same time period (t(19.4) = 0.68, p = 0.51). The disparity observed in impacts to coral cover between eastern windward and western leeward sites between 2013 and 2017 was even greater than that observed between 2013 and 2015, with a 59% decline (from 29 \u00b1 13 to 12 \u00b1 1%, t(16.6) = 6.05, p \\ 0.001) at the eastern sites and no significant difference in coral cover observed at western sites (t(20.4) = 0.9, p = 0.377). However, it should be noted that the small sample size of eastern seaward slope sites surveyed in 2017 may not be representative of the full extent of the windward side of the island.\nevent itself triggered repeated extreme tide episodes that killed exposed corals, which were then subjected to further warming in the subsequent year.\nprogram of benthic cover and coral size/condition data at high priority reef flat sites, and four that were developed specifically to assess bleaching severity and bleaching-associated impacts to benthic cover during and after the events documented above. These survey methodologies were developed and implemented in succession, as the Guam Coral Reef Response Team adaptively allocated limited field survey capacity based on need, and as informed by personal observations and preliminary analysis of existing data. The implementation of different survey methods to document the extent and severity of coral bleaching events on Guam resulted from: (1) The need to take advantage of data produced by an existing survey effort though this program was not specifically designed to assess bleaching impacts as they are occurring; (2) The need for methods appropriate for particular reef zones or communities; (3) Limited personnel and resources available to carry out surveys; and (4) The timing of the surveys, also related to resource availability. Multiple sampling approaches and survey methods are often necessary to understand the impacts of acute disturbances, such as coral bleaching events, across distinct coral reef communities and at different spatial and temporal scales. However, the integration of multiple datasets into a single, comprehensive analysis requires an understanding of the limits of each methodology and the potential biases that manifest in the generated datasets. A critical analysis of these methods, and the datasets they generate, can inform changes to an approach to assessing the impacts of acute disturbances, with the aim of maximizing data accuracy and comparability. Here, we present a qualitative analysis of the sampling approaches and survey methods used in the present study, with recommendations for improving comparability of datasets generated by different methodologies across different reef communities, as well as suggestions for further evaluating the comparability of these data. Our rationale explaining the order of implementation of survey methods is as follows: 2013 The island-wide randomized approach targeting the seaward slope maximized overlap with randomly generated sites surveyed by NOAA PIRSC in 2011. Reconnaissance indicated this zone was most severely impacted by bleaching stress; significant mortality had not yet been observed at the reef flat/staghorn areas being monitored when this decision was made. 2014 The NOAA CRW automated system did not catch the warming event in time to allow for team mobilization; as stated above, the 2014 bleaching event occurred six months after the 2013 event. Documentation of 2014 events was thus limited to bleaching reconnaissance and limited personal observations. Subsequent improvements in the accuracy of the NOAA CRW early warning system in 2015 greatly increased our capacity to mobilize for future events. 2015 Resources were available for a subset of the islandwide seaward slope sites surveyed in 2013; these were prioritized to assess the cumulative impacts of the 2013 and 2014 events and to establish a new baseline against which recovery and future impacts could be evaluated. Observations of the rapid onset of bleaching mortality among a small number of staghorn communities in 2014 triggered the island-wide staghorn coral mortality assessment in 2015 to address this major knowledge gap. The geographic scale of the effort and limited staff availability necessitated the adoption of a rapid assessment protocol that took advantage of existing geospatial data developed by the Guam Long-Term Monitoring Program. 2016 As Co-PI on a NOAA Saltonstall-Kennedy reef resilience assessment project, DB helped develop a sampling strategy that maximized overlap between resilience assessment sites and seaward slope sites surveyed in 2013 and 2015. Resilience assessment field surveys conducted at the beginning of the bleaching season were fortuitous in that the data collected at both the seaward slope and lower depths provided a good record of the limited impact of the 2016 temperature anomaly on these communities. In contrast, significant bleaching and mortality was observed at rapid reef flat canary sites. Though semiquantitative, data generated allowed BMI values to be derived, BMI was not initially incorporated into our protocol but it provided a tractable and rapid post hoc assessment of genera at risk, and will be utilized as part of our standard protocol in the future. 2017 Significant bleaching had not been observed at the reef flat canary sites when Response Team members observed severe bleaching along the seaward slope. Those observations and NOAA CRW predictions informed the timing of the re-survey of sites previously visited in 2013, 2015, and 2016. Additional mortality observed at several staghorn sites as a result of extreme low tides in 2015, and bleaching and disease in 2016, necessitated the re-survey of all major staghorn communities around the island. A more quantitative approach to assessing staghorn condition was implemented at this time. We identify the following specific issues with our multiple survey bleaching response approach and highlight changes we are incorporating to address these issues. \u2022 Two metrics were used to assess bleaching prevalence from photo-quadrats: percentage of total colonies and percentage of total coral cover. A preliminary analysis of data collected using both methods in 2013 suggests that these values were significantly different for the same sites. These differences are likely related to the sensitivity of each measure to community composition and size structure. We intend to quantitatively evaluate these data sets to determine the nature and consistency of these differences across taxa and population size distributions, as they potentially influence our interpretation of the data and subsequent management decisions. \u2022 The two methods used to assess staghorn mortality in 2015 versus 2017 were not comparable quantitatively. The 2015 method allowed for a very rapid assessment of a large number of sites in a very short period, which was the intention of the surveys. However, the 2017 assessments provided a more quantitative reference point for future assessments of the condition of remaining staghorn beds. An effort to re-map the areal extent of these beds is planned, but because satellitebased photo-imagery cannot distinguish live versus dead coral cover, these surveys will require in-water ground-truthing. \u2022 The use of quasi-permanent transect locations based on GPS coordinates introduced additional variance into key parameters such as species composition, and undoubtedly lowered statistical power. \u2022 The ability of the canary sites to detect island-wide bleaching across reef zones was called into question in 2017. NOAA CRW products showed that thermal stress for Guam peaked in October, when mean bleaching prevalence at the canary sites was 29%. However, BMI calculated after the events revealed differential generic responses between 2016 and 2017, with three key genera, Acropora, Porites, and Sinularia, showing much more severe responses in 2017. Further, October seaward slope assessments estimated bleaching and bleaching mortality to be 48%, with observations of bleaching to 40 m. These widely varying responses between reef zones suggested that reef flat rapid assessments may not adequately inform bleaching response efforts for seaward slope sites. We plan to incorporate the use of the BMI as part of our rapid response protocol, as its utility as a means of identifying taxa at particular risk and comparing taxon performance between reef zones makes it a valuable addition to our toolbox. We also intend to establish permanent transects at these sites for future assessments and to add shore-accessible seaward slope sites to canary sites for rapid reconnaissance. \u2022 The Guam Coral Bleaching Response Plan (Hoot and Burdick 2017) was designed to leverage existing mechanisms, such as projections provided by NOAA CRW and temperature data from in situ loggers deployed in long-term monitoring programs. In general, in situ loggers recorded maximum temperatures of 1-2\u00b0C higher than satellite-derived SSTs. Thus, these loggers may provide an effective local early warning system at scales relevant to individual coral communities, in conjunction with CRW alerts. A schematic of our response protocol is presented in Fig. 6 as a decision tree to guide activities according to both event severity and resource availability. This protocol, the bleaching response plan, and the formation of an interagency Guam Coral Reef Response Team have allowed local managers and researchers to proactively plan for events before they occur and mobilize rapidly, thus increasing effective resource allocation and improving consistency among response efforts. However, maintaining flexibility is key to success, given limited resources. As overall improvements to our bleaching response, we will (a) align reef flat, canary, and staghorn sites where possible and appropriate; (b) align semiquantitative bleaching condition assessments for all surveys and zones, to the extent possible (i.e., standardize coral condition categories, survey area, and survey duration); (c) conduct power analyses prior to surveys to determine appropriate sample sizes; (d) conduct rapid calibration protocols between methods and among personnel and discuss calibration results, to better standardize surveys; and (d) coordinate data collection efforts for other projects to maximize site overlap and timing to extent possible. In summary, the use of multiple survey methods is often necessary in order to adequately sample different reef communities within distinct reef environments, and to take advantage of data that may not have been collected for the same purpose. Our results show that these different reef communities can respond to an acute disturbance in significantly different ways, and data collected for a single reef community type, however broadly distributed it may be within a biogeographic region, may not be representative of other reef communities and thus may not provide an adequate measure of the totality of impacts to the reef areas within that region. The results of Jokiel et al. (2015) indicate that estimates of broad-level parameters generated from different survey methods, such as coral cover, appear to be relatively consistent across most methods. However, their results also indicate that measures of diversity can differ significantly between methods. While the impacts of recent bleaching events on the diversity of corals on Guam's reefs were not assessed in this study, further analysis will include an examination of impacts to diversity, and thus should consider known biases in estimates generated by different sampling approaches.\namong Montipora species were likely greater than what we report here. The trajectory and character of change in Guam reef communities that has been initiated by the onset of repeated, severe coral bleaching events will be a focus of future analyses. For example, dead staghorn communities that have already been reduced to rubble at several sites may persist in this flattened state, as rubble is an unstable recruitment substrate (Raymundo et al. 2007;Birkeland et al. 2013a, b). The flattening of these stands may, in turn, reduce the ability of reef flat platforms to dissipate wave energy, particularly during storms (Ferrario et al. 2014;van Beukering et al. 2007), and will likely impact the populations of fish species that utilize staghorn Acropora thickets for one or more phases of their life history. Colonies that remained secured to existing \nsubstrate began resheeting within months after warming subsided, via an apparent ''phoenix effect'' (Dias-Pulido 2009;Roff et al. 2014). This phenomenon involves the survival of residual tissue deep in the skeleton, thus providing a tissue ''reservoir'' for regrowth. Observations suggest resheeting of dead skeleton was largely responsible for the increase in coral cover in the Tumon Bay and West Aga\u00f1a thickets from 2016 to 2017, despite the severe temperature anomaly in 2017 (Table 2). This effect was enhanced at sites that were well flushed, as increased water movement likely mitigated warming impacts by improving coral resilience to heat stress (Nakamura and van Woesik 2001;Fifer 2018). However, recruitment of other species onto dead staghorn skeleton was also common, suggesting that colonies that do not resheet may be replaced by developing communities comprised of Pavona, Pocillopora, and Porites. Coral diversity declines northward along the Mariana Arc, a pattern primarily driven by the general northward decrease in island size and differences in habitat type and availability between the older, primarily carbonate islands in the south and the younger, volcanically active islands in the north (Richmond et al. 2008, Brainard et al. 2012. A recent analysis of larval transport pathways in the region concluded that Guam populations of coral taxa with pelagic larval durations \\ 20 d are primarily self-seeding, and that there is a northward bias in larval transport within the archipelago (Kendall and Poti 2015). The implications of these findings, in light of recent coral bleaching-associated impacts to Guam's coral communities, are twofold: Recovery following mass coral mortality events via larval import for these taxa is likely to be negligible on Guam, and as vulnerable coral populations decline on the high diversity coral reefs of Guam, their ability to act as a larval source for the northern reefs of the Mariana Archipelago will decrease in the coming decades."}, {"section_title": "Reef flat long-term monitoring", "text": "A long-term monitoring program for reef flat platforms along Guam's western coastline was established in 2009. Five reef flats are monitored three to four times per year, along (n = 3) permanent 20 m 9 1 m belt transects per site. Two of these sites (Luminao and Piti Bomb Holes) are dominated by Porites; Tanguisson, Tumon Bay and West Aga\u00f1a are dominated by large staghorn Acropora thickets and Pavona spp. The line-intercept method was used to characterize benthic composition; live hard coral cover data from this data set were analyzed to examine changes over time between 2012 (prior to bleaching onset) and 2017. At one site (West Aga\u00f1a), transect markers were lost in a storm in 2013 and redeployed in approximately the same positions; thus, only data from 2014-2017 were used in this analysis."}, {"section_title": "Assessment of staghorn Acropora loss", "text": "The areal extent of all known staghorn Acropora populations (n = 21) around Guam was previously determined using ArcGIS heads-up digitization of a 2011 Worldview-2 satellite image mosaic, and ground-truthed by in-water surveys carried out between 2009 and 2013 (described in Raymundo et al. 2017). A rapid, semiquantitative assessment of the extent of mortality and condition of these communities was undertaken from November 2014 to February 2015, after anecdotal reports of severe bleaching in 2014 ( Fig. 1). Surveys were carried out while snorkeling, as these communities are primarily restricted to shallow reef flats and lagoonal patch reefs. Surveys involved visual estimation of percent and patterns of mortality for all populations, verification of species composition, and georeferenced photo-documentation to further develop the spatial data layer compiled prior to bleaching. Postbleaching areal extent was calculated by multiplying percent mortality estimates by pre-bleaching areal extent. Coral loss was then calculated as the difference between pre-and post-bleaching area values, with a margin of 10% variation from the mean to account for uncertainty that is inherent in visual estimates (Raymundo et al. 2017). An assessment of 13 individual staghorn Acropora colonies tagged for reproductive activity in Tumon Bay Marine Preserve was undertaken in July 2014, when bleaching was observed within this population. Colonies were individually inspected for percent of the colony affected and bleaching severity (pale, bleached, partially dead). Repeated mortality events following the completion of surveys in 2015 prompted a second set of surveys of the same 21 populations in 2017. All populations except those in Apra Harbor were assessed from February to May, prior to bleaching season. Surveys at Apra Harbor sites surveys took place in October, during the height of the bleaching event. These surveys scored coral condition as live or dead at 16 points within replicate 0.25 m 2 quadrats placed on staghorn thickets. Quadrats were placed every 1-2 m along a visually estimated transect that bisected the thicket; one or more additional transects perpendicular to the first were also assessed for larger thickets. Percent mortality was then calculated as: # of points of dead skeleton or rubble 16 \u00c2 100 and average mortality per thicket was then calculated from the replicate quadrats. Additional data on coral condition collected within quadrats included species composition, recovery via recruitment or resheeting, disease, predation, percent rubble (a sign that the thicket was breaking down), and recruitment of other species onto dead skeleton. As above, total coral loss per site was calculated as the prebleaching areal extent (assuming 100% coral cover within thickets) minus percent mortality per thicket, and expressed in ha."}, {"section_title": "Rapid reef flat site assessments", "text": "Eight shallow reef flat sites were selected in 2016 for rapid assessment of bleaching severity during the bleaching event ( Fig. 1). Sites were selected based on accessibility and species composition. The selected coral communities were predicted to respond quickly to bleaching and thus provide a rapid means of tracking the scope and severity of the bleaching event as it progressed. Reef flat sites were surveyed on multiple occasions between August and December 2016 and between September and November 2017, corresponding to warming events during each of these years. Snorkelers conducted 20-minute timed swims along (n = 3) parallel 1 m-wide belt transects, at 1-1.5 m depth. The start and end coordinates for each transect were recorded using a handheld Garmin GPS attached to a float. Survey area was calculated by multiplying the transect length by 1 m width. Transect length and the distance between transects were dependent on the spatial extent of target coral communities, and thus varied across sites. Re-surveys started at the same coordinate and compass heading. In 2016, two sites were surveyed twice and two were surveyed three times; the remaining four sites were each surveyed four times over the five-month period, for a total of 26 surveys. In 2017, all sites but one were surveyed twice, for a total of 15 surveys. The total reef area surveyed in 2016 was 791 m 2 , with a mean of 98 m 2 \u00b1 62 m 2 surveyed per site. In 2017, we surveyed a total reef area of 916 m 2 , with a mean of 116 m 2 \u00b1 54 m 2 per site. All coral colonies within each belt were identified to species, where possible, and characterized by the severity of bleaching (no bleaching, partial colony paling, partial colony bleaching, whole colony paling, whole colony bleaching, and partial or whole colony mortality). Bleaching prevalence was calculated as: # of points of dead skeleton or rubble 16 \u00c2 100 A bleaching mortality index (BMI) (McClanahan et al. 2004) was calculated for all genera with more than 5 colonies counted across all surveys accomplished in September for each year (2016 and 2017), using the formula: Bleaching severity categories used in our study were pooled to fit into the four bleaching categories used in the index: c1 = unbleached; c2 = moderate (partial colony paling; partial colony bleaching; whole colony paling); c3 = severe (whole colony bleaching; partial colony mortality); c4 = dead (whole colony mortality).\nA total of 9670 observations were made during 15 surveys at the eight sites, representing 18 coral genera and at least 35 species. Mean bleaching prevalence across surveyed reef flat sites for all surveys was 35 \u00b1 4%. Mean bleaching prevalence across sites for September was 40 \u00b1 7%, and for October to November was 29 \u00b1 5%. As in 2016, the most severe bleaching was observed in Agat; bleaching prevalence at this site was 74% in late September. BMIs were higher in Acropora, Heliopora, Porites, and Sinularia than those calculated for 2016, but lower in Psammocora, Goniastrea, and Isopora (Table 2).

Temperatures reached Alert Level 1 levels (4 B DHW B 8) on 13 August, and Alert Level 2 (C 8 DHW) on 3 September; Alert Level 2 status continued through most of October. A maximum SST of 31.5\u00b0C was recorded on 31 August (Fig. 2, 2013). Maximum recorded in situ temperatures of 31.5\u00b0C were recorded from the Ipan buoy (southeastern Guam; Fig. 1) in both August and September, 32.6\u00b0C from the Ritidian buoy (northwestern Guam; Fig. 1) in September, and 34\u00b0C from the Luminao (central western Guam; Fig. 1) reef flat logger in July. Accumulated heat stress reached a peak of 12 DHW in early October and did not fully dissipate until late December. Temperatures remained above 29\u00b0C through 19 December, with brief declines as low-pressure systems passed nearby. A pair of cyclones in mid-October caused southwest wave heights in excess of 5 m and resulted in a brief hiatus from high temperatures (Fig. 2, 2013). Wave heights on western exposures were variable; however, wave heights on eastern exposures stayed below 2 m through most of the bleaching period.\nThe onset of the sea surface temperature anomaly occurred early in the year, less than six months after dissipation of the previous event, with satellite-derived SST first exceeding the 30\u00b0C bleaching threshold on 25 May, and a maximum SST of 31\u00b0C recorded on 20 June (Fig. 2,  2014). Satellite-derived temperatures remained between 29\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C through December; however, temperatures recorded by in situ loggers exceeded 31\u00b0C periodically between June and September. Accumulated heat stress reached a peak of 9 DHW in mid-September and dissipated by mid-December. Periodic low-pressure systems were associated with increased wave heights and decreased temperatures in July, August, and October (Fig. 2, 2014). As the El Ni\u00f1o event developed in 2014, sea levels began to decrease around Guam, resulting in extreme low tides beginning in August ( Figure S1, 2014). Prior to 2015, the NOAA CRW automated operational Satellite Bleaching Alert email system was based on measurements obtained at a single stationary 50 km satellite grid cell. In 2014, this alert system issued a Bleaching Watch for Guam in mid-May, as SST first reached the maximum monthly mean within the grid cell. A Bleaching Warning was issued between mid-June and early July, corresponding to SST values between 30.0 and 30.6\u00b0C. Bleaching Watch conditions continued through late November, but accumulated heat stress never exceeded 3 DHW. NOAA CRW has since migrated to a higher resolution product that utilizes a grid of 5 km cells extending across a larger area around each jurisdiction. The retrospective SST measurements presented above and associated CRW alerts based on the 5 km product indicated that the 2014 temperature anomaly was of significantly greater magnitude and duration than that recorded by the 50 km product. The 5 km product signaled the onset of Bleaching Watch conditions in early April. Alert Level 1 conditions were reached on 29 June, and after brief declines in SST, Alert Level 2 conditions persisted from late August through September. Bleaching Watch conditions did not dissipate until the end of December.\nGuam experienced frequent weather disturbances in 2015, including close approaches by six cyclones. Three others passed close enough to affect weather conditions in Guam (Fig. 2, 2015). Decreased SST and high wave heights were associated with these events. Satellite-derived sea surface temperature reached 29\u00b0C in May and exceeded the 30\u00b0C bleaching threshold briefly in July and August, reaching a peak of 30.8\u00b0C on 31 July; conditions warranted Bleaching Warning status for a total of eleven days (Fig. 2, 2015). Data collection at the buoys was inconsistent in 2015 due to impacts from disturbances; data are not presented here for this year. With the onset of a strong ENSO event, sea level decreased by 0.35 m between late 2014 and 2015. Mean low water declined to -0.15 m in December 2015 (Fig. S1, 2015), and extreme low tide values in excess of -0.1 m were recorded every month in 2015, with peak values in excess of -0.3 m below mean sea level in October and November. These ENSO-associated extreme low tide events repeatedly subaerially exposed shallow reef flat coral communities throughout the year, causing mortality of the top several inches of exposed tissue. Partial mortality was particularly pronounced during the summer months, triggered by a combination of exposure for several afternoon hours on consecutive days and doldrum-like wind conditions resulting in reduced water circulation ( Fig. S2). Seaward slope surveys took place from mid-June to mid-September, when signs of heat stress would be expected. Coral quadrat and photo-transect surveys yielded similar bleaching prevalence values (pale and bleached colonies), with island-wide means of 3 \u00b1 3% and 3 \u00b1 2% (n = 3851 colonies censused), respectively. Bleaching was not reported by the authors or other observers (such as Guam's Eyes of The Reef participants) at other reef areas during the period coinciding with the temperature anomaly. The results of the quadrat surveys indicated that an average of 13 \u00b1 9% of observed colonies exhibited partial to full-colony mortality attributable to the 2013 and 2014 events. The prevalence of mortality attributed to the 2013 and 2014 events was similar for the eastern windward and western leeward sites (14 \u00b1 12% and 12 \u00b1 4%, respectively) ( Fig. 3).\nConditions around Guam warranted Bleaching Watch status by 18 May. Sea surface temperature reached 30\u00b0C, and a Bleaching Warning was issued on 19 July. A maximum SST of 30.9\u00b0C was recorded on 25 July (Fig. 2, 2016). In situ temperatures above 30\u00b0C were recorded at the Ipan buoy starting on 30 May, and the maximum reef flat temperature recorded was 35.6\u00b0C, in July, from Tumon Bay (West-central Guam). The Ritidian buoy was offline until 16 June but recorded in situ temperatures above 30\u00b0C beginning on 28 June and maximum temperatures above 32\u00b0C in July and August (Fig. 2, 2016). Conditions reached Alert Level 1 for seventeen days starting on 27 August, and accumulated heat stress peaked at 5.5 DHW between 9 September and 10 October. Sea surface temperature decreased after tropical disturbances and monsoons in August and September, but remained elevated through 19 December.\nSea surface temperature exceeded 29\u00b0C on 30 April and 30\u00b0C on 8 June. Water conditions were calm and no   Mean bleaching prevalence was calculated as the percentage of total observed colonies recorded as pale or bleached, averaged across all survey sites; colony assessments were pooled within sites.

Both satellite-derived and buoy temperatures exceeded 31\u00b0C in August. Maximum in situ reef flat temperatures of 34.4\u00b0C and 34.8\u00b0C were recorded from Tumon Bay in June and August, and 35\u00b0C in Agat in June. Conditions warranted Alert Level 1 on 6 August, Alert Level 2 on 22 August, and remained at Alert Level 2 status for 57 d. Temperatures remained above 29\u00b0C through the end of the year, and bleached corals were observed at depths in excess of 30 m in October. Accumulated heat stress reached a peak of 13 DHW in mid-October, exceeding the previous record high of 12 DHW in 2013 (Fig. 2, 2017)."}, {"section_title": "Seaward slope surveys", "text": "The island-wide mean percentage of shallow (5 m depth) seaward slope coral cover that was pale or bleached in 2013 was 20% \u00b1 16%; an additional 11% \u00b1 9% of coral cover exhibited bleaching-associated mortality, for a total of 32% \u00b1 19% of coral cover that was impacted by the bleaching event (Fig. 3).

Similar to the 2015 bleaching site re-surveys, the 2016 reef resilience surveys began prior to the onset of the temperature anomaly but continued into months during which bleaching would be expected.\nThe impacts of the 2017 bleaching event on shallow seaward slope communities exceeded those observed in 2013, with an island-wide mean of 33 \u00b1 12% pale or bleached coral cover and an additional 15 \u00b1 17% of coral cover exhibiting bleaching-associated mortality (Fig. 3). In total, 48 \u00b1 17% of coral cover was impacted by the 2017 bleaching event, compared to the 32 \u00b1 19% of coral cover impacted by the 2013 bleaching event (t(39.2) = 2.61, p = 0.013). In contrast to the pattern observed in 2013, percentages of pale, bleached, or recently killed coral cover at the seaward slope sites during the 2017 bleaching event were similar for both the eastern windward (52 \u00b1 21%) and western leeward coral communities (46 \u00b1 17; t(9) = 2.26, p = 0.66) (Fig. 3). We recognize, however, that the limited number of windward sites (n = 3; Fig. 1) likely affected this comparison. Observations from semiquantitative, off-transect surveys revealed prevalence of pale, bleached, and/or bleaching mortality was 61 \u00b1 12%, slightly greater than the severity calculated from phototransects (t(11.7) = 2.19, p \\ 0.001). Semiquantitative, off-transect surveys also revealed that 92% of all surveyed coral taxa and 98% of coral genera exhibited paling, bleaching, or bleaching-associated mortality (summarized in Table 1). The five coral genera with the highest percentages of normally pigmented colonies were as follows: Galaxea (94%, n = 322), Goniopora (92%, n = 92), Leptastrea (88%, n = 457), Diploastrea (81%, n = 80), and Cyphastrea (64%, n = 104).

In 2015, two species, A. aspera and A. virgata, were observed in one site each, and a third species, A. teres, was observed at two sites. Acropora vaughani was not observed in 2015 and has not been seen since, which suggests that it may be extirpated from Guam's waters. Of the remaining three staghorn species, A. cf. pulchra was the most common, found in 16 of the 21 sites surveyed (Raymundo et al. 2017). Surveys in 2015 documented cumulative mortality from both elevated SSTs and the onset of extreme low tides across 2013 and 2014; thus, it was not possible to attribute mortality within these populations to specific years or events. Cumulative mortality from the 2013-2015 events, which was first reported in Raymundo et al. (2017), was estimated at 53% \u00b1 10%.

All populations experienced bleaching-induced mortality in similar patterns. Large thickets (C 0.3 ha in size; 11 out of the 21 sites) showed high mortality in the center of the stands, with remaining live tissue limited to thicket margins. In sites that had experienced high storm-driven wave energy, thickets with high mortality were reduced to rubble, with no signs of recovery. Outbreaks of a rapidly progressing white syndrome were observed in Tumon in 2016 (18.7% prevalence), and in three sites in 2017 (Tumon, Tanguisson, and Apra Harbor; 13.4%, 10.2%, and 24% prevalence, respectively) during the bleaching season, which caused additional mortality. Resheeting over dead skeleton was observed by 2017 in thickets with large central dead patches, which accounted for lower total mortality estimated in 2017. However, three species, Acropora aspera, A. virgata, and A. teres, were all reduced to a single stand, with estimated mean mortalities of 62% \u00b1 37%, 92% \u00b1 10%, and 44% \u00b1 23%, respectively.

The level of heat stress associated with the 2013 sea surface temperature anomaly around the island was the highest since satellite measurements began, but this record was exceeded in 2017. Lower-magnitude, but still historically significant, heat stress events occurred in two of the three intervening years.

Coral cover on monitored reef flats along the western coast declined 37% by 2017. Staghorn Acropora communities were particularly devastated; three experienced complete mortality. Nearly a third of coral cover was lost islandwide along the shallow seaward slope between 2013 and 2017, with approximately 60% of coral cover lost along the eastern windward coast. An earlier analysis of 2013 data concluded that the difference in bleaching prevalence observed between windward and leeward sites was, in part, attributable to the greater proportion of bleaching-susceptible taxa (primarily acroporids) within shallow windward coral communities (Reynolds 2016). The decline in shallow seaward slope coral cover observed between 2015 and 2016 did not appear directly associated with thermal stress-driven mortality, as bleaching prevalence at seaward slope sites during this period was very low and no mortality was reported. The cause of this decline could not be determined from this preliminary analysis, but observations by LR, DB, and WH suggest that some of the mortality may have been attributed to elevated coral disease (white syndrome) and corallivorous snail (mainly Drupella) predation. The minimal bleaching prevalence at seaward slope sites in 2016 was in contrast to significant bleaching impacts recorded at reef flat sites that same year. Thus, our data suggest differential responses to heat stress between reef flat and seaward slope coral communities. Differences in environment (such as water circulation), species-specific responses of dominant taxa, and a latent effect of the 2015 extreme low tide events on the bleaching susceptibility of reef flat corals could have contributed to the mortality differences we observed between these distinct reef zones. No significant decline in coral cover was observed at shallow seaward slope sites between 2016 and 2017, despite the more severe thermal stress experienced in 2017. However, the 2017 bleaching response surveys were carried out while the event was ongoing; quantitative surveys were not conducted following the complete dissipation of thermal stress in late 2017. The higher percentage of bleaching-impacted coral cover recorded during the 2017 event, and qualitative observations of catastrophic mortality of shallow-water Acropora species at several seaward slope sites in 2018, suggest a loss in coral cover at shallow seaward slopes comparable to the 2013 event."}, {"section_title": "A critical methods analysis", "text": "This assessment of recent bleaching-associated impacts to Guam's coral reefs relied upon quantitative or semiquantitative datasets generated by five separate survey types that involved a total of seven individual survey methods (summarized in Table S1).

Wallace (1999) synonymized Acropora virgata with A. formosa (now A. muricata) but Guam colonies, which are identical to Dana's A. virgata, are morphologically distinct from A. muricata. This taxonomic quandary is illustrative of the difficulty in ascertaining scleractinian coral species boundaries, and the challenge this presents for coral species conservation. Our analyses and recent post-bleaching observations suggest that other species may also be at high risk. Three previously common species: Stylophora pistillata f. mordax and the caespitose Acropora cf. azurea and A. verweyi have been greatly reduced across multiple sites. Stylophora pistillata f. mordax declined precipitously in 2017, and few living colonies were observed during multiple visits to various sites in 2018. Acropora cf. azurea and A. verweyi, typically found at 1-4 m depth along exposed seaward slopes, were locally abundant prior to 2013 (refer to Fig. 7a, d, f). While bleaching impacts recorded during the event were not exceptional for these two species, observations in 2018 at previously surveyed sites, and at other reef areas where these species were locally abundant, suggest catastrophic ([ 95%) mortality. This apparent discrepancy may be a result of the relatively low number of colonies encountered during surveys, which were conducted at depths slightly greater than their preferred range, or a sharp increase in mortality following survey completion. Observations of significant mortality among colonies of the major structure-providing species, Acropora abrotanoides (Fig. 7d), as well as other species, such as Acropora monticulosa and Acropora palmerae, once common features of Guam's reef front and shallow slope zone, have also raised concern about the long-term viability of these species. Thus, ''safety in numbers'' (Birkeland et al. 2013a, b) may not be providing a refuge from extirpation for these key, highly susceptible species.

The variability in response to thermal stress between leeward and windward communities appeared driven in part by differences in the proportion of bleaching-susceptible taxa, while variation in the responses of reef flat and seaward slope communities may be driven by differences in community composition and the environmental regimes of these distinct reef zones. Other environmental drivers of bleaching patterns, such as cyclonic activity, wave height, the timing and severity of anomalous warming, have not yet been examined, but will be considered in future analyses. Other possible drivers of the declines we observed, such as disease, predation, and local stressors, must also be considered. The full impact to the diversity, structure, and function of Guam's coral reefs from the mortality documented in this study, and implications for the future of Guam's coral reef ecosystem, remains unresolved. However, projections of increasing bleaching frequency raise concern that coral recovery will not keep pace with mortality. Should this occur, the result will be a net loss in cover until a currently undefined threshold is reached, beyond which recovery may not be possible at timescales relevant to present human communities. Van Hooidonk et al. 2016predicted that annual severe bleaching in the Mariana Islands could begin by the early 2020s, but the events documented here suggest that even this alarming estimation may have overestimated the time that Guam's shallow-water corals have to acclimate and adapt to rapidly warming ocean temperatures. Detailed documentation of ongoing changes to community structure, key ecological processes, and the status of vulnerable reef taxa is critical to formulating effective management strategies for the conservation of remaining reef diversity and function. Guam is likely a sentinel for the type of near-future change that awaits other small islands throughout the global range of coral reefs. The lessons we learned from documenting and responding to this experience may thus provide guidance and insight for scientists and managers who are challenged by similar impacts."}]
