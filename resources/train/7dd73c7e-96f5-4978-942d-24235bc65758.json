[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Throughout the world, proposals to reduce carbon emissions include increased research and development (R&D) funding (de Coninck et al., 2008;Newell, 2007). Both a 1997 report from the President's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) and a 2004 report from the bipartisan National Commission on Energy Policy recommended doubling U.S. government energy R&D spending. Others advocate increases by a factor of five or ten, likening the need for new energy technologies to the Manhattan Project's efforts to create a nuclear weapon (Kammen and Nemet, 2005). Such proposals raise two concerns. First, R&D subsidies will likely have little effect unless accompanied by policies requiring significant emissions reductions. Second, dramatic increases in energy R&D may come at a high cost, as these research efforts may draw away research funding and scientists from other productive sectors (Popp, 2006a;Schneider and Goulder, 1997;Yang and Oppenheimer, 2007). This paper focuses on the second of these concerns, by asking whether new energy R&D efforts replace other types of R&D spending. Recent efforts to endogenize technological change in Integrated Assessment (IA) models of climate policy highlight the need to properly account for the opportunity cost of environmental R&D investments. Because the social returns to R&D investments are typically higher than the social returns to other types of investment, any new environmental R&D that comes at the expense of other R&D investment will dampen the cost-savings potential of induced technological change. Popp (2004) shows that assumptions about the magnitude of such crowding out explain much of the variation in results across IA models with induced technological change. For example, among models that use R&D expenditures as the means by which technology improves, Nordhaus (2002) assumes a fixed supply of R&D labor, so that new energy R&D completely crowds out other R&D. As a result, he finds induced technological change has little effect on welfare or climate policy. In contrast, Buonanno et al. (2003) model energy R&D and other R&D as complements, so that crowding out does not occur. Their model finds a stronger effect for policy-induced R&D than other models. Note that the question of crowding out is even more important for IA models than it is for energy R&D policy. In many IA models, such as those cited above, overall technological change is treated as exogenous. While we may observe that other R&D falls when energy R&D increases, crowding out due to supply-side constraints need not be the only cause. Rather, such a relationship may simply be a result of rational, profit maximizing firms switching R&D resources from opportunities that become less profitable as energy prices increase (e.g. designing larger, gas-guzzling vehicles) to opportunities that are more profitable (e.g. designing hybrid vehicles). In such a case, one might not be concerned about crowding out from the perspective of a policy maker increasing spending on energy R&D-in fact, such changes in the composition of R&D may be a desired policy effect. However, in terms of these models, whether or not it is profitable to reduce R&D on other projects is irrelevant. Since energy R&D is endogenous in these models, but other R&D is not, R&D resources switched from non-energy to energy projects will be double-counted unless the reduction in non-energy R&D is accounted for by reducing the level of autonomous technological change when more energy R&D is induced. That is, exogenous levels of autonomous technological change in these models should only include the effects of non-energy R&D. If energy R&D replaces other forms of R&D, the effects of autonomous technological change must fall. Thus, for IA models, the relationship between energy and non-energy R&D is important whether or not supply-side constraints exist. 1 Unfortunately, there has been little empirical work addressing the magnitude of potential crowding out effects. Related work includes Link (1982), who finds evidence that part of the measured decline in productivity R&D in the 1970s occurred because more R&D was directed toward environmental research, whose benefits (e.g. a cleaner environment) were not measured in traditional market outcomes. Using macroeconomic data, Nemet and Kammen (2007) find little evidence of crowding out from federal energy R&D spending. However, in a survey of Austrian firms, Roediger-Schluga (2003) finds most firms canceled or postponed other R&D projects in order to increase environmental R&D after passage of new volatile organic compound standards. 2 This paper looks at the tradeoffs resulting from increased energy R&D spending directly, focusing on both the private and social opportunity costs of energy R&D. Here, the key question is whether increases in energy R&D are likely to represent new R&D spending, or whether some (or all) of the additional climate R&D comes at the expense of, or crowds out, other R&D. To address the social opportunity costs of climate R&D, we ask whether the social value of energy R&D differs from other types of innovation. The paper also contributes to the literature on energy R&D by providing a detailed description of who performs this R&D. We explore the question of private R&D opportunity costs at several levels. First, we examine the effect of economy-wide increases in energy R&D on total R&D spending at the industry level in order to investigate whether investment dollars flowing to energy-related research are coming at the expense of overall R&D in specific sectors. While this first question addresses flows across sectors, it does not tell us whether and how research activity changes within individual firms as energy R&D activities increase. To address this second question, we use patent data to examine changes in the research portfolios of companies actively performing energy R&D. New energy R&D undertaken by firms will crowd out other R&D if firms are financially constrained. Several papers have examined factors determining firmlevel R&D financing and conclude that financial constraints are often present. These results vary by country (e.g., financial constraints appear more binding in the U.S. and U.K. than in France and Germany) and by firm size (financial constraints are more binding for smaller firms). 3 Moreover, Lach and Schankerman (1988) show that firms tend to smooth R&D investment over time, suggesting that there are large adjustment costs to changing the level of R&D within a firm. However, such studies have typically used aggregate industry or firmlevel R&D data. Thus, they are unable to distinguish between types of R&D performed. In this paper, we combine firm-level financial data taken from the Compustat database of publicly traded firms, with patent records for the same firms. We use patent classifications to separately identify the results of energy research projects from other research. Using these data, we can investigate whether increases in energy patents replace other patenting activity at the firm level. As we find some evidence of crowding out within sectors, we conclude by considering the social value of research by energy firms. Using patent citation data as a measure of the social value of innovations, we ask whether energy patents are more valuable than other innovations. While we do find evidence that energy R&D patents are more valuable, they do not appear to be more valuable than the patents most likely to be crowded out by an increase in energy R&D."}, {"section_title": "Crowding out across sectors", "text": "We begin by looking at the effect of energy R&D spending on overall R&D activity at the sectoral level. Here, we are interested in whether R&D flows across sectors when energy R&D levels change, so that there is a net draw on R&D away from specific sectors. For this, we use R&D data from the National Science Foundation Survey of Industrial Research and Development. One limitation to these data is that industry-level energy 1 Throughout the paper, the term \"crowding out\" is not meant to have normative implications, but simply to refer to a case where energy R&D replaces other types of energy R&D. While we explore whether this occurs due to financial constraints or changes in research composition due to profit-maximizing behavior, for expositional purposes we refer to both types of changes as crowding out. 2 In a related vein, several authors have asked whether increases in defense R&D spending crowds out other R&D. Examples include Morales-Ramos (2002), Buck et al. (1993), and Mueller and Atesoglu (1993). 3 Recent papers on R&D financing constraints include Brown et al. (2009), who find financial constraints for young, but not mature, firms, Hall et al. (1999), who find stronger financial constraints in the U.S. than in Japan and France; Harhoff (1998), who finds weaker constraints in Germany, with smaller firms most affected; Bloch (2005), who finds financial constraints for smaller firms in Denmark, and Bougheas, G\u00f6rg, & Strobl (2003), who find evidence of financial constraints in Irish firms. Hall (2002) provides a review of this literature on firm-level financing of R&D. R&D data are not available for all industries. Although published energy R&D data include industry-level breakdowns, there are many missing observations in these data. This is particularly true in industries that do not perform much energy R&D. Thus, we are only able to include economywide energy R&D financed and performed by industry. This allows us to focus on crowding out across sectors. That is, as the total level of energy R&D spending goes up, do R&D resources flow from non-energy sectors to those doing more energy R&D? Fig. 1 shows the trends in this variable, for both company-financed and federal-government financed energy R&D performed by industry. Defining IRD i,t as company-financed R&D performed in industry i at time t, ERD t as the level of total company-financed energy R&D spending in year t, FEDRD t as federally-funded R&D performed by industry, 4 and Y i,t as value added in industry i at time t, we propose the following relationship: All variables are in levels, rather than logs, to test whether a dollar of energy R&D crowds out a dollar of overall R&D. 5 We include the lagged dependent variable to allow for gradual adjustment of R&D in response to changing conditions. Allowing further for gradual adjustment, we estimate an alternative model using lagged values of value added and federal R&D. 6 Standard errors are corrected for heteroskedasticity using robust standard errors. Because we are using panel data, lagged industry-performed R&D may be endogenous. In short time series panels, lagged values of the dependent variable are likely correlated with the fixed effect. Thus, we use an instrumental variables approach, using one-and two-year lagged values of the other independent variables as instruments. Dynamic panel bias becomes insignificant as the number of time periods increases (Roodman, 2009). As such, we estimate alternative models treating lagged industryperformed R&D as either endogenous or exogenous. Our strategy for identifying crowding out across industries is to see how changes in the overall level of energy R&D spending affect company R&D performance at the industry-level. However, because we have total industry-level R&D on the left-hand side, but economy-wide energy R&D on the right-hand side, our dependent variable includes energy R&D financed by that industry. This limits the industries to which we can apply the model, since in some industries the dependent variable will include energy R&D for that industry. For an industry that does not perform energy R&D, such as the food industry, this is not a problem. A coefficient of 0 on the energy R&D variable in these industries suggests that R&D in that industry is not affected by increases in overall energy R&D, so that crowding out is not a problem. For these industries, we would be concerned about crowding out only if the coefficient on energy R&D was negative-implying that an economy-wide increase in energy R&D took R&D resources away from this industry. However, it is unclear how to interpret the energy R&D coefficient for industries that perform a significant amount of energy R&D. In these industries, as energy R&D increases, their overall R&D spending should increase, as some of the economy-wide energy R&D occurs within the industry. However, without knowing how much of the economy-wide energy R&D occurs within each industry, we do not know the magnitude by which overall R&D should increase. As a result, in this section we focus only on industries performing little energy R&D. We begin by looking at the percentage of R&D devoted to energy R&D in years for which data are available, and include only industries which spent, on average, less than 5% of overall R&D on energy R&D. 7 Because of data availability, we look at two samples. From 1983 to 1997, we have data for 16 industries, of which 11 spend less than 5% of their R&D budget on energy. However, this does not allow us to look at crowding out during the energy crisis of the 1970s, when energy R&D levels were highest. Thus, we also look at a subsample of 7 industries that have data available from 1973 to 1997. Of these, only 3 spend less than 5% of their R&D budget on energy. Tables 1 and 2 list the industries in the larger and smaller samples, respectively, along with descriptive data on the key industry variables. The tables also show the average percentage of R&D devoted to energy within each sector, for the years in which industrylevel detail is available. In each table, the industries are sorted by this percentage. Finally, note that the last two lines of each table present summary statistics for all industries with more than or less than five percent of R&D devoted to energy. In both samples, energy intensive industries are larger. These include industries such as petroleum refining 4 Unfortunately, there are several missing observations in the industry-level data for federally-funded R&D performed by industry, so that we can only include aggregate levels of government-funded R&D. 5 At the request of one reviewer, we have also run the model in log-log form. The main results do not change and are available from the authors by request. 6 In both cases, we use current energy R&D to test for crowding out, as this allows us to test for potential supply-side constraints. Such constraints suggest that the total supply of R&D is inelastic, so that contemporaneous increases in one type of R&D result in a loss of other types of R&D. 7 For sensitivity analysis, we also obtained results using cutoffs of 1% and 10% for energy-R&D intensive industries. These are available from the authors upon request. and transportation equipment. In the following section, we use firm level data to focus on activity within one energy intensive sectors. Table 3 presents our results. The top section shows results for the longer sample, which begins in 1974 but only includes three industries. The first two columns treat lagged industry R&D as endogenous, while the second two do not. Note that the results are generally similar whether the lagged value is endogenous or exogenous. When endogenous, the fit of the first stage is somewhat poor, with an F-stat slightly less than the \"rule of thumb\" of 10, suggesting weak instruments (Baum et al., 2007;Staiger and Stock, 1997). Moreover, the p-value for Hansen's J-statistic suggests the instruments are endogenous when using lagged values of all control variables. Given this, we get a slightly better fit of the model when lagged R&D is exogenous. Moreover, the key results don't change, so we consider this to be our preferred specification. In all specifications, the insignificant coefficient on economy-wide private energy R&D spending suggests that increases in energy R&D elsewhere in the economy have no Table 3 Industry-level crowding out results. 3 Industries: 1974Industries: -1998 Industry R&D endogenous Industry R&D exogenous  : 1984-1998 Industry R&D endogenous Industry R&D exogenous  effect on overall R&D spending in these specific industries. Thus, we find that increases in energy R&D spending do not appear to crowd out R&D in unrelated sectors. Results for other variables are generally as expected. The model suggests that R&D adjusts gradually, with the coefficient on lagged industry R&D between 0.75 and 0.85. Industry value added has a small impact on overall R&D, and is significant only when using current value added as the control. When significant, the coefficient on value added of about 0.03, which seems reasonable given that just over two percent of GDP is devoted to R&D. Finally, the coefficient on federal R&D is near 0 for all cases, suggesting little crowding out of overall private R&D spending from overall levels of government R&D. The bottom panel of Table 3 presents results for the shorter time series but with 11 industries. The results are similar here, but the fit of the model is poorer. Once again, the instruments perform poorly, so we focus on the results with the lagged dependent variable exogenous. We again see evidence of gradual adjustment, and a positive coefficient on value added. More importantly, there is once again no evidence of crowding out. The results of these regressions suggest that, during past spikes in energy research activity, research funding did not flow from non-energy R&D sectors to sectors performing R&D. We thus turn our attention to within sector R&D activity, to ascertain whether increases in energy R&D lead to reductions in other types of R&D within the same industry."}, {"section_title": "Crowding out within sectors", "text": "To address the question of crowding out within sectors, we look at the research decisions made by individual firms. In principle, we would like to know if increases in energy R&D at the firm level crowd out other types of R&D. Unfortunately, R&D data are not available at the firm level with this level of detail. Instead, we use patents as a proxy for energy and other R&D. 8 Using patent data, we classify firm research outcomes as energy-related or not. We then ask whether increases in energy-related research lead to decreases in other research. Our model specification is purposely sparse. Define OPAT i,t as nonenergy patents assigned to firm i, with an application year of t. Similarly, EPAT i,t represents energy patents from these same firms. X i,t represents a vector of firm-specific control variables, such as capital, sales, or debt, to control for firm size. To test whether firms face financial constraints, X i,t also includes profits. Crowding out is most likely to occur when firms face financial constraints, so that they are unable to take advantage of all profitable research opportunities. In the existing literature on R&D financing, tests of financial constraints are indirect (see, for example, Hall, 2002). Intuition about these tests can be gained by considering what firms choose to do with new cash flow. If firms choose to invest new cash flow in additional R&D, this suggests that the firm faced research opportunities that it had not taken advantage of due to financial constraints. We estimate an equation of the form: where a i and b t represent firm and year fixed-effects. Note that because we are using patents as a proxy for R&D spending, we do not include R&D spending as a control variable. While one would expect increases in R&D to increase patenting activity, it does not allow us to determine whether one type of R&D has replaced the other. We include year effects to allow for changes in patent policy that change the propensity to patent among all inventors, and to control for truncation problems in the last years of our data. Because not all patent applications are made public, we obtain the application years of our patents from the final granted patent publication. We have data on patents granted through 2002. Since some patent applications filed in the late 1990s and early 2000s would still have been pending in 2002, counts of patent applications in these years will be too low. As such, we restrict our analysis to patent applications filed between 1970 and 1999. Year dummies correct for any remaining truncation problem."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "Our focus is on patents for new energy technologies. These include renewable technologies such as wind and solar power, as well as new sources that may use fossil fuels, such as fuel cells and coal liquefaction. This sample includes firms from a broad cross-section of industries, including refineries, chemicals, and automobile manufacturers. Our patent data comes from two sources. First, we identify relevant energy patents using the Delphion patent database, using a combination of patent classification codes and, in the case of energy efficiency patents, appropriate keywords. 9 Appendix A shows the technologies included in our paper, along with the relevant search strategies for each. To identify all patents granted to firms working in these fields, we use the NBER patent database (Hall et al., 2001). Based on the firm information available in the NBER database, this leaves us with a sample of patents granted from 1971 to 2002. 10 From this, we calculated the total number of patents granted to each firm in our sample, along with the number of energy patents. We eliminated firms where nearly all patents are energy patents, such as International Fuel Cells or Ballard Power Systems (a fuel cell manufacturer). 11 We also eliminated firms with less than 1.5% of their patents in one of our energy categories. This eliminates large, diversified firms such as General Electric and some chemical companies. In both cases, the percentage of energy patents is so small that one would not expect to identify any reasonable relationship between energy and other patents. For the remaining firms, we searched Compustat to identify firm-specific variables. Our firm-specific variables, all measured in billions of 2000 dollars, are capital (Compustat item #8: Property, Plant, and Equipment-Total (Net)), net sales (Compustat item #12), profits (Compustat item #18), and debt (Compustat item #9). Using only firms with greater than 1.5% of their patents in either technology area, this leaves us with a sample of 13 firms for automotive technology and 31 firms for alternative energy. Table 4 displays, by firm, average values for each of the variables in our dataset. To get a sense of who patents in these technology areas, Tables 5 and 6 present the top patent assignees by field. Table 5 lists the top 20 assignees for each field. This list is dominated by large firms with just a few percent of their total patents falling in these categories. Only a few predominately energy companies, such as International Fuel Cells Corporation, appear in the top 20. Table 6 lists the top 20 firms having the greatest percentage of their patents falling in one of these categories. Here, we only include firms with 10 or more patents in these areas, as there are hundreds of firms that have only one relevant energy patent and no other patents. There are many companies specializing in the alternative energy field, as relevant energy patents comprise 70% or more of the total patent portfolio for each of the firms in the top 20. Overall, the distribution of assignees is highly skewed. Not counting patents assigned to individuals, there are 3059 unique patent assignees in the alternative energy field. Of these, 1935 have just one alternative energy patent. Only 17% of alternative energy patents are assigned to the top 20 assignees (not counting individually assigned patents). There are 18,107 total patents in this field. The companies included in our regression have 2011 of these, or 11%. For these 31 firms, energy patents represent 3.6% of their total patenting activity. 8 Griliches (1990) shows that patents, sorted by their year of application, are strongly correlated with R&D expenditures, and thus make a good proxy for R&D spending. For a discussion of other applications of patent data in environmental economics, see Popp (2005). 9 Available at www.delphion.com. 10 The NBER database limits us to patents granted from 1968, as firm identifiers are not available before that date. Similarly, the NBER data currently ends in 2002. However, we only use patents granted from 1971 because the Delphion database only includes abstracts for keyword searching on patents beginning in 1971. 11 Our initial cutoff for this was firms with more than 2/3 of their patents pertaining to energy. However, once we search for financial data on the remaining firms, no firm with more than 29% of their patents pertaining to energy remain in the dataset. Finally, Fig. 2 shows energy and non-energy patents for the firms in our regression. In the figure, patents are sorted by the year of application. The number of energy patent applications per year is on the left y-axis, and the number of non-energy patent applications per year is on the right yaxis. Note that alternative energy patents increase during the energy crises of the 1970s. Afterwards, energy patents decline, and non-energy patents increase, suggesting possible crowding out. Table 7 presents our results. The null hypothesis is that energy patents do not crowd out other patents, which we fail to reject unless the coefficient on energy patents is significantly different from zero. The table includes four specifications: two treating the lagged dependent variable as endogenous, and two treating it as exogenous. In all cases, energy patents are treated as endogenous. We use lagged values from t-1 to t-3 of the exogenous dependent variables (profits, sales, debt, and capital) as instruments, along with second-and third-year lagged values of energy patents. All regressions use GMM estimation with firm and year fixed effects. Robust standard errors are presented. The first two columns of Table 7 present results using current values of the control variables, while the second two columns present results using lagged values of the controls. 12 The fit of the model is generally good, with R 2 statistics near 0.6. This is slightly lower than is typically found in the financial constraints literature, where R 2 statistics typically approach 0.8 (see, for example, Bloch, 2005 andBougheas et al., 2003). The slightly worse performance of our regressions likely comes from the additional noise added by using patents, rather than having direct measures of R&D available to us. In both cases, regression diagnostics suggest that the instrumental variables for the lagged dependent variable are not sufficient. As shown by the p-value from Hansen's J statistic presented below the estimates, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the instruments are valid. However, in columns 1 and 3, the Wald F statistic based on the Kleibergen-Paap rk statistic is less than the \"rule of thumb\" of 10, suggesting weak instruments (Baum et al., 2007;Staiger and Stock, 1997). This is not a problem when only instrumenting for energy patents (columns 2 and 4). Fortunately, there is 12 In both cases we use current values of energy patents, as we are asking whether a contemporaneous increase in energy patents comes at the expense of other research.  little change in the results when treating the lagged dependent variable as exogenous, suggesting that dynamic panel bias is small given the large number of time series observations available to us (Roodman, 2009). The results show that other patenting activity at these firms does decrease when energy patenting increases, as the coefficient is negative and significant in all four regressions. In each case, the coefficient is less than negative 1, suggesting that a new energy patent fully crowds out a non-energy patent. 13 As expected, the coefficient on sales is significant, suggesting that larger firms patent more. The coefficient on debt is negative, as is typical, but is insignificant in all cases. The lagged dependent variable suggests gradual adjustment, with coefficients generally near 0.75."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The coefficient on profits is of particular interest, as it is insignificant each regression. That firms do not spend additional income on new research opportunities suggests that these firms are not financially constrained-they have already taken advantage of all profitable research opportunities. Thus, we have found that, after controlling for firm size and profits, other patenting activity does decrease when energy patents increase, but that firms do not otherwise appear financially constrained. 14 In combination, this suggests that decreases in other patenting activity are a result of changing opportunities, rather than crowding out. That is, the same market forces that make alternative energy research more profitable also make other types of research less profitable. We explore this possibility further below."}, {"section_title": "What is crowded out?", "text": "Given the evidence that alternative energy replaces other types of R&D, we take a closer look at innovations in a subset of our sample to see what might be lost when alternative energy innovation increases. To be able to categorize these other patents in greater detail, we limit our focus to the 12 firms from our alternative energy sample that are energy refinery companies. 15 To begin, Table 8 verifies that the results of the previous section hold for these 12 firms. We see that the signs and magnitudes generally remain similar. Because of the smaller sample size, the negative effect of energy patents is only significant at the 10% level, and only in three of the four regressions. In the unlagged model, weak instruments are a problem, resulting in higher standard errors on the energy patent coefficient. Profits remain insignificant, suggesting that any  Fig. 2.

Patents are sorted by the year of application. 13 Moreover, dividing the coefficient by one minus the coefficient on the lagged dependent variable suggests a long run decrease between 6 and 12 patents. 14 Indeed, profits remain insignificant in a regression of total patents on sales, profits, capital and debt. 15 These firms are Amoco, Atlantic Richfield, Chevron, Conoco, ExxonMobil, Gulf, Kerr-McGee, Mobil, Occidental, Standard Oil, Texaco, and Tosco.

Standard errors in parentheses. tradeoffs between energy and non-energy patents are not a result of financial constraints. 16 Using patent classifications, we categorize all of the patents from these 12 firms into one of 7 technology groups: alternative energy, coal-based fuels, environmental, refining, chemistry, drilling wells, and other technologies. Alternative energy patents include traditional renewable sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal. Coal-based fuels include coal gasification and coal liquefaction patents. In the regression analysis of the previous section, both of these are categorized as alternative energy patents. Among the refineries, these coal-based fuels are an important component of alternative energy innovation, comprising two-third of the alternative energy patents for these firms. Thus, we consider these separately from other alternative energy patents. Environmental patents pertain to pollution control, and include techniques for cleaning up oil spills, as well as isomerization refining techniques developed as part of the phase-out of lead from gasoline and reformulated fuels. Appendix B presents a complete list of the patent classifications in each technology group. Fig. 3 shows trends in these seven groups over time. Table 9 shows the correlation between patent applications per year in each category. 17 Because overall patent counts move together over time (for instance, as a result of changing firm revenues), we look at both correlations between counts of patents in each group, as well as correlations between the percentage of each year's patents belonging to each group. Using raw patent counts, all correlations are positive. However, the two smallest correlations are between alternative energy and refining, and coal-based fuels and refining. The correlations between either alternative fuels or coal-based fuels and environmental patents are also small. Using correlations between the percentage of patents in each category per year, we now see several negative correlations. This is expected, since the sum of percentages in each year must sum to 100. Here, the correlation between alternative energy patents and refining patents is strongly negative, at \u2212 0.70. The same holds true for the correlation between coal-based fuels and refining. The correlation between alternative energy and pollution control innovations is also negative, but its magnitude is much smaller, at \u22120.39. Finally, to focus on the period when alternative energy research is most active, panels C and D of Table 9 repeat the analysis for only those patents from 1973 to 1987. As shown in Fig. 3, this covers the period in which alternative energy innovation increased and then returned to pre-energy crisis levels. While refinery 16 Similarly, we ran regressions using only the non-refinery firms. Here, the coefficient on energy patents is negative, but slightly smaller (\u2212 0.69 to \u2212 1.04) and insignificant.

Unlike the overall model, debt is significantly negative.

The correlation between the number of alternative energy patents and wells patents is 0.30, and the correlation between the percentages of these patents is \u2212 0.65. While only suggestive, these correlations provide evidence that much of what is replaced by increased alternative energy research are innovations on refining and drilling wells, both of which would increase production of fossil fuels. Thus, while it is important for such crowding out to be accounted for in integrated assessment models, these results also suggest that one effect of policies designed to increase alternative energy R&D is to lower incentives for R&D on traditional fossil fuel energy sources."}, {"section_title": "The social value of energy innovations", "text": "While the analysis of the preceding section provides some evidence as to how the composition of research portfolios change as energy research increases, it does not tell us anything about the social value of this research. Economists consistently find that the social returns to research are higher than a firm's private returns. 18 This deviation results from knowledge spillovers due to the public-good nature of new knowledge. A successful innovator will capture some rewards, but those rewards will always be only a fractionand sometimes a very small fractionof the overall benefits to society of the innovation. Hence innovation creates positive externalities in the form of knowledge spillovers for other firms and consumers. If the social returns to new alternative energy R&D are no different from the social returns to the R&D that is crowded out, then simply measuring the magnitude of crowding out is sufficient. However, if these social returns differ, the ultimate economic effect of crowding out will be miscalculated unless these differences are accounted for. A priori, there are two reasons to expect that alternative energy research may have a greater social value than other research. First, comparatively less research has been done on alternative energy than other fields, particularly at the beginning of our sample. As a result, alternative energy starts from a lower knowledge base, leading to greater opportunities for big breakthroughs and positive spillovers than more mature technologies. Second, energy technologies may have influence in many sectors, raising the possibility that innovations will have the characteristics of General Purpose Technologies (GPT) (see, for example, Helpman, 1998). 19 We use two measures of social value. Both make use of patent citation data. Many researchers have used patent citations as an indicator of the value of a patent. 20 First, we consider the number of patent citations received by each patent in our sample. We assume more frequently cited patents have more value to society, as they provide the building blocks to a larger number of future innovations. Second, we use a measure of patent generality described in Hall et al. (2001). Generality asks whether a patent is cited by other patents from many different technological fields, or just by other similar patents. The index ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values representing more general patents. More formally, generality is a Herfindahl index defined as where s ij denotes the percentage of citations received by patent i from patents in patent class j, out of a total of n i patent classes. Our assumption is that more general patents provide more social value, as they provide building blocks to innovations in more sectors of the economy. Our analysis makes use of the patents from the previous section. Citation data come from the NBER patent database, which includes all citations made by patents granted between 1975 and 2002. Based on this, we restrict our analysis to patents with application years between 1975 and 1999. Table 10 provides descriptive data on generality and citations received by both energy and non-energy patents in our database. In addition, a more detailed breakdown is provided for the seven technology groups introduced for refineries in the previous section. The descriptive data suggests that alternative energy patents are cited more frequently, and are more general, than other patents. However, simply looking at descriptive data does not tell the whole story, as citation patterns vary over time, as well as across technologies. For example, the number of opportunities to be cited is important. Patents are likely to receive more citations if there are more patents in the years immediately following publication. Moreover, older patents, such as the bulk of alternative energy patents, have had more chances to be cited than more recent patents. In addition, more recently granted patents are more likely to cite previous patents, as a result of both computerized data bases making searching for relevant patents easier, as well as increasing legal pressure to include all relevant citations in the final patent. Regression analysis allows us to control for such features, using fixed effects for patent application year to control for the number of citing opportunities that follow. For both citations and generality, our regression takes the following form. Define y i as the variable of interest-either the subsequent citations received by patent i, or the generality index of patent i. Dummy variables indicate whether or not a patent is an alternative energy patent. For non-energy patents, we also include a dummy variable for the general technology type, based on the classification system used in the NBER patent database. Each patent is categorized as a chemistry, computer, medical, electronic, mechanical, or miscellaneous patent. This accounts for the finding that some fields are more active than others, and thus more likely to receive citations. Miscellaneous patents are the excluded category. Our regression becomes:  As many patents are never cited, we use a negative binomial regression for the citation analysis. Results are reported as e \u03b2 , so that they can be interpreted as the likelihood of citation relative to a base case patent, a non-energy patent belonging to an automotive firm. Because generality is bounded by 0 and 1, we use a Tobit regression to 18 See, for example, Mansfield (1977Mansfield ( , 1996, Pakes (1985), Jaffe (1986), Hall (1996), and Jones and Williams (1998). 19 In a related vein, both Hart (2008) and Gerlagh et al. (2009) raise the possibility that optimal carbon tax rates would be higher than the Pigouvian rate if spillovers from emissions-reducing technology were greater than for other technologies. For instance, in such a case, policies to address the general problem of knowledge spillovers in the economy would be insufficient for a technology with greater than average spillovers. 20 See, for example, Lanjouw and Schankerman (2004) Popp (2006b), and the papers cited in Jaffe and Trajtenberg (2002). examine whether energy patents are more general than other patents assigned to the firms in our sample. We do a similar analysis of refinery patents, using only dummies for the seven technology groups and year fixed effects. Because refinery patents are most likely to be crowded out, they are the excluded category. Table 11 presents our results. Panel A confirms that alternative energy patents are 6.5% more likely to be cited than other patents from these firms. Among various technology types, alternative energy patents are second most likely to be cited, with only computer patents cited more frequently. Similarly, as shown in the last column, alternative energy patents are more general than other patents from these firms, with computer patents again being the only category more general. Panel B shows the results using only patents from the 12 energy refineries, allowing us to compare the value of alternative energy patents to those most likely to be crowded out. Our excluded category is refining patents. While alternative energy patents are more general than refining patents, suggesting that they do impact more areas of the economy than the innovations they replace, their social value is not much higher. These patents are 8% more likely to be cited, but the result is not statistically significant. Thus, while the crowding out effect within the refining sector appears to have a positive environmental effect, by replacing research designed to enhance the production of fossil fuels, the value of these innovations to future researchers is no different than the value of the research that is replaced."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "As calls for increased energy R&D strengthen, it is important to know where funding for these efforts will come from. In particular, to the extent that new energy R&D funding crowds out other R&D efforts, the social benefits to new energy R&D will be dampened. Using both industry and firm-level data from the United States, this paper takes a first look at the source of energy R&D. Using industry data, we find no evidence of crowding out across sectors. Economy wide increases in energy R&D do not appear to draw R&D resources away from those industries that are not actively involved in energy research, mitigating the concern that new energy R&D programs will draw resources away from other innovative sectors of the economy. Looking within sectors, we use firm-level patent data to take a closer look at alternative energy research. Since we combine these patent data with financial data from Compustat, our sample is restricted to large, publicly traded firms. We find that increases in the number of alternative energy patents assigned to these firms do lead to decreases in other types of patents by these firms. However, we do not find evidence that these firms face financial constraints, suggesting that the reduction in other research is simply a response to changing market opportunities. Using more detailed patent data on refinery companies, we find that alternative energy research most likely crowded out innovations on refining and wells. This is consistent with the notion that any apparent crowding out reacts to market incentives-as opportunities for alternative energy research become more profitable, we would expect research opportunities for traditional fossil fuels to appear less appealing to firms. This suggests that any crowding out which has occurred in this industry had a positive environmental effect, by enhancing greener technologies at the expense of dirtier ones. Finally, we use patent citation data to compare the social value of energy research to other research by these firms. We find that alternative energy patents are cited more frequently, suggesting that they provide greater value to future inventors. They are also more general as they are cited by a larger range of other patents than nonenergy innovations. This is consistent with the notion that energy innovations can have a broad impact on the economy, because of the importance of energy use throughout the economy. This supports the notion of both Hart (2008) and Gerlagh et al. (2009) that optimal carbon tax rates could be higher than the Pigouvian rate because of higher than average spillovers, suggesting that simply \"getting the prices right\" is not enough to fully encourage alternative energy R&D. However, confining our analysis to refineries, we find no difference in the social value of alternative energy patents compared to the refining and wells patents most likely to be crowded out by alternative energy research, suggesting that once crowding out is properly modeled in integrated assessment models, additional adjustments for variations in the social value of energy research and the research that it replaces are not necessary. Our results have implications both for policy and for integrated assessment modelers. For policy, a key result is that any crowding out that may occur appears to affect dirty technologies. Thus, policies enhancing research incentives for green technologies have the additional desired effect of reducing incentives for research on dirty technologies such as fossil fuels. To illustrate the importance of this, consider the results of Gerlagh (2008), who presents a climate model allowing for a choice of carbon-energy producing R&D, carbon-energy saving R&D, and neutral R&D. Gerlagh simulates the effect of a carbon tax on his model, and finds that carbon-producing R&D, rather than neutral R&D, is crowded out by induced carbon-energy saving R&D. As a result, the impact of induced technological change is larger than in other models with crowding out, with optimal carbon taxes falling by a factor of 2. For integrated assessment modelers, the results highlight the importance of incorporating the costs of R&D in the model. Many integrated assessment models include detailed descriptions of alternative energy research, but treat other forms of technological change as exogenous. As this exogenous technological change includes research that may decline when alternative energy research increases, not adjusting this exogenous rate will double-count gains from induced technological change, even if the decrease in research results from profit-maximizing decisions of how to allocate research inputs, rather than crowding out from financial constraints."}]
