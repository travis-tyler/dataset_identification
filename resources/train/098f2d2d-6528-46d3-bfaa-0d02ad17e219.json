PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the relentless accumulation of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) inclusions known as Lewy bodies and neurites (LBs and LNs, respectively) manifested clinically by a broad clinical spectrum of motor and non-motor symptoms, presenting diverse PD subtypes with different clinical features and rates of progression [16] . For example, the DATATOP study explored the heterogeneity of PD clinical features, revealing heterogeneity of PD not only in motor phenotypes (i.e., tremor, rigidity, or postural instability and gait disturbance subtypes), but also in non-motor symptoms (e.g., cognitive decline, autonomic features), age of onset and pathologic features. Several clinicopathologic studies have revealed that LBs, LNs and neuronal loss in different areas in the brain are related to the motor subtypes (tremor vs. akinesia/rigidity) and other clinical features of PD patients [17, [30] [31] [32] . These data suggested different pathophysiological mechanisms of the clinical motor subtypes of PD and the disease heterogeneity that have important prognostic implications. Furthermore, the involvement of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, cortical LBs/LNs, and/or cerebral angiopathy is more prevalent in non-tremordominant (non-TD) phenotype than tremor-dominant (TD) phenotype [11, 14, 15, 33, 40] .\nIt is increasingly evident that cognitive impairment, including dementia, is a frequent and highly problematic non-motor manifestation in PD patients, and a risk factor for increased mortality [1, 12, 19] , with great variability in progression over time [2, 13, 41] . Clinical markers (e.g., motor phenotype) can be useful to predict disease progression, but, they have limitations. For instance, clinical markers are unstable in early-stage PD and are influenced by the introduction of PD pharmacotherapy. Conversely, biochemical biomarkers may provide insights into the pathogenesis and variable long-term course of PD, and could identify molecular subtypes that may have differential response to treatment.\nWe previously reported on the association between baseline cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and clinical features in the first 102 PPMI subjects including 63 drug-na\u00efve early PD patients [18] . Although the number of subjects was limited, we described several findings in this qualified cohort: (1) in PD patients, CSF \u03b1-syn, amyloidbeta1-42 (A\u03b2 ), total tau (t-tau), and tau phosphorylated at Thr181 (p-tau) concentrations were lower than those in healthy controls (HC). (2) The PD-associated lower levels of CSF biomarkers were more prominent in patients with the non-TD phenotype, particularly in patients with postural instability and gait-disturbance dominant motor phenotype (PIGD) compared with TD phenotype. (3) A significant correlation between the concentration of \u03b1-syn and t-tau or p-tau, but not A\u03b2 , was observed in both PD and HC. These results suggest the following hypotheses: (1) CSF concentrations of \u03b1-syn, A\u03b2 , t-tau, and p-tau in drug-na\u00efve early-stage PD patients are lower than those in HC. (2) In subgroup analysis according to the motor phenotype, and/or CSF biomarker levels, the measures of these CSF biomarkers may distinguish and help to explain brain changes that underlie clinical subgroups of PD, which may influence on progression and response to disease modifying therapies. (3) As multiple and dynamic processes might coexist in PD, the interaction between \u03b1-syn and tau or A\u03b2 could play a role in the development or progression of PD complexity and heterogeneity [15] .\nWhile our preliminary data were of great interest, they needed to be further explored in a larger cohort since these findings vary across prior studies [4, 22, 23, 28, 29, 34] . Other studies have suggested that lower CSF A\u03b2 1-42 levels predict more rapid cognitive decline in PD [5, 35] . In the large de novo PD cohort of PPMI we are able to investigate cross-sectional associations between CSF biomarkers and cognition which may herald future decline. PPMI is the largest ongoing, prospective, longitudinal, multinational study of drug-na\u00efve early PD and matched HC, and this cohort continues to mature [27] . To describe CSF biomarker levels in PD as compared to HC at baseline, and to test our preliminary study-driven hypotheses in the larger population including very early-stage PD enrolled in 21 qualified clinical sites, we analyzed baseline CSF biomarker levels, and the association with genotypic and clinical features in the full dataset of 660 PPMI subjects (189 HC, 412 PD and 59 scans without evidence of dopamine transporter deficit or SWEDD) in the present study."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants and sample size", "text": "As described previously, newly diagnosed, drug-na\u00efve PD patients (N = 423), age-and gender-matched HC subjects (N = 196) and SWEDD individuals (N = 60) were recruited between June 2010 and May 2013, from 21 PD centers in Europe and the United States according to the PPMI protocols (http://ppmi-info.org/study-design). The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of all participating sites, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants before inclusion in the study. Subjects underwent clinical (motor, neuropsychiatric and cognitive) and imaging assessments and donated biologic samples including CSFs. Of 679 enrolled individuals, 660 subjects (189 HC, 412 PD, and 59 SWEDD) who agreed to donate their CSF samples at baseline visit were included in this study. Detailed standardized protocols for patient selection, clinical assessments, biospecimen analysis, and data acquisition are described elsewhere. A diagnosis of PD in all patients was made within 2 years before the screening visit, and only patients with a Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) stage of I or II were included, except 2 PD subjects with H&Y III. The disease severity was assessed by use of MDS-UPDRS rating and H&Y stage. As described in our previous study [18] , we classified PD by their baseline motor symptoms as manifesting TD, PIGD, or IND using previously published formula [18, 36] , but we combined PIGD and IND groups into a non-TD group due to the observation of instability of these subgroups based on our preliminary data analysis. To compare the clinical parameters between groups with the relatively low versus high level of CSF biomarkers, we classified PD groups by quintile levels of CSF biomarker (i.e., biomarker level 0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80 and 80-100 percentile in PD groups) and compare PD groups with the lowest quintile (0-20 percentile) and the highest quintile (80-100 percentile) levels."}, {"section_title": "Analysis CSF biomarkers", "text": "CSF was collected by standardized lumbar puncture procedures.

The results for t-tau in 6 baseline samples (2 HC and 4 PD) and p-tau in 2 baseline samples of PD did not meet the SOP criterion requiring a bead count of at least 50; therefore, these values were excluded from statistical analysis. CSF \u03b1-syn and CSF hemoglobin levels were analyzed using appropriate commercially available sandwich type ELISA kits (Covance, Dedham, MA), as previously described.

The NeuroX array is an Illumina Infinium iSelect HD Custom Genotyping array containing Illumina standard content exonic variants and additional custom variants designed for neurological disease studies. Of the custom variants, approximately 12,000 are designed to study PD and are applicable to both large population studies of risk factors and to investigations of familial disease and known mutations.

Statistical analysis was performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), and values with p < 0.05 were regarded as statistically significant.

The comparison of various clinical parameters or CSF biomarkers between groups is exploratory in this observational study; therefore, analyses were done without correction for multiple comparison. The correlation between CSF biomarker levels were evaluated using Spearman's rank correlation. To examine the effects of the level of CSF biomarkers on the clinical variables, we divided PD patients by quintile of each CSF biomarkers or ratios, and compared the clinical parameters between the highest quintile and the lowest quintile (e.g., \u226420 vs. >80 percentile of \u03b1-syn). The effect of clinical variables on specific CSF biomarker levels were examined in univariate and multivariate linear regression models with adjustment for confounding factors. Any variables that had univariate associations with p values less than 0.15 were included in a multivariate model.

The severity and disability assessed by the Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) total score, cognitive performance [i.e., verbal memory assessed by Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-revised (HVLT-R), processing speed/attention assessed by Symbol Digit Modality Test (SDMT), executive function/working memory assessed by WMS-III Letter-Number Sequencing Test (LNS), visuospatial abilities assessed by Benton Judgment of Line Orientation test (BJLO), and global cognitive function assessed by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)], and neuropsychiatric symptoms in HC, PD and SWEDD are summarized in Table 1 . As expected, the test scores for motor symptoms (higher MDS-UPDRS III score), global cognitive function (lower MoCA score), neuropsychiatric symptoms (higher SCOPA-AUT and STAI score), verbal memory (lower HVLT-R score), semantic fluency (lower semantic fluency score), processing speed/attention (low SDMT score) and dopamine transporter ligand (DaT scan; DaTSCAN\u2122 or [\n123 I]\u03b2-CIT) uptake in the PD group were significantly different from those in the HC group. Clinical variables in the SWEDD group were similar to those of the PD subjects; however, the UPSIT score and DaT uptake in SWEDD subjects were significantly higher than in the PD group and more comparable to the HC group. The UPDRS-I (non-motor symptoms) and UPDRS-III (motor symptoms) scores of the SWEDD group were significantly higher and lower, respectively, than those scores of PD subjects.\nWhen PD subjects were classified by their motor phenotypes as previously described [18, 36] , 293 had a TD phenotype and the others were either PIGD (N = 73) or indeterminate (IND; N = 45).

The significantly lower level of \u03b1-syn in PD patients relative to HC subjects was still observed (p = 0.0005) when we excluded subjects with high CSF hemoglobin (Hb) levels (>200 ng/mL) to avoid potential impact of contaminant plasma Hb [18] . When we excluded the 102 subjects (63 PD and 39 HC) reported in our preliminary study [18] and tested this subset of the full PPMI population (349 PD and 150 HC) there was little change in the statistical significance of the results. Therefore, we report the findings in the full population that includes these 102 subjects in this manuscript. The CSF biomarker levels of SWEDD subjects indicated that they had values between the HC and PD groups, and the median concentrations of CSF \u03b1-syn and A\u03b2 in SWEDD subjects were significantly higher than in the PD group.\nTo test the hypothesis from our previous study that lower level CSF concentrations of \u03b1-syn, t-tau, and p-tau in PD patients may be significantly associated with the non-TD phenotype, we compared the levels of CSF biomarkers between TD and non-TD patients (Table 3 ). The level of CSF \u03b1-syn in the non-TD group was significantly lower than that in the TD group (p = 0.0271), and this was still observed after exclusion of subjects with high CSF Hb levels (p = 0.0376). However, none of the other CSF biomarkers were significantly different between the TD and non-TD groups.

However, genotype frequencies for SNCA allele rs356181 in PD patients were significantly different from those in HC subjects (p = 0.0075) consistent with previous GWAS findings [24] . To evaluate the effects of genotypes for alleles of APOE, MAPT or SNCA gene on the levels of CSF biomarkers, we compared the CSF biomarker levels according to the genotypes in the HC and PD groups. As the numbers of SWEDD subjects according to genotypes were limited, we excluded this group from these analyses. The level of CSF A\u03b2 1-42 in \u03b54 carriers was significantly lower and the p-tau/A\u03b2 1-42 ratio of \u03b54 carriers was higher than those of \u03b54 non-carriers in both HC and PD groups. The t-tau/A\u03b2 1-42 ratio in \u03b54 carriers in the HC group was significantly higher than that of \u03b54 non-carrier in the HC group.

Mostly consistent with these initial findings, analysis of our qualified full baseline dataset of 660 PPMI subjects here enable us to report several key findings: (1) CSF concentrations of \u03b1-syn, t-tau and p-tau, but not A\u03b2 , were lower in PD compared with HC, but with significant overlap between the groups; (2) the concentration of CSF \u03b1-syn in non-TD phenotype PD patients was lower than in TD PD patients; (3) the relatively lower level of CSF A\u03b2 or the higher CSF t-tau/A\u03b2 1-42 ratio was associated with more severe baseline cognition and motor symptoms of PD when we stratified PD patients into quintiles based on CSF biomarker levels; (4) there was a strong, significant correlation between the level of CSF \u03b1-syn and t-tau, less so for p-tau and A\u03b2 , and between A\u03b2 1-42 and tau species in both HC and PD. (5) APOE \u03b54 genotype was associated with low levels of CSF A\u03b2 in both the HC and PD subjects, but not with diagnosis of PD or clinical features.\nSeveral previous reports support our finding of lower levels of CSF tau proteins (t-tau and p-tau) in PD compared with HC [23, 34] , although other studies have not observed this finding [4, 22, 28, 29] . This discrepancy may be caused by one or more of several factors, including different characteristics of the control group (e.g., control with other neurologic symptoms but without neurodegeneration vs. healthy control), different time interval from initial diagnosis in the PD groups, or the different analytical methods used to measure the CSF tau species. It is likely that the levels of CSF \u03b1-syn and tau species in early-stage PD patients are lower, analogous to the finding of lower CSF A\u03b2 1-42 levels in patients with probable AD compared with HC. However, these biomarker findings in PD patients appear to have little diagnostic value. They may help to explain mechanisms of neurodegeneration that underlie disease heterogeneity in PD, including variation of clinical characteristics and prognosis.\nConceptually, \u03b1-syn aggregation in the CNS of PD patients may lower the release of \u03b1-syn into CSF similar to how amyloid plaque formation leads to lowered A\u03b2 release into the CSF in AD. Basic research and neuropathology studies have suggested interaction between \u03b1-syn and tau in the brain [7, 8, 10, 43] , which are further supported by our findings of a significant correlation between CSF \u03b1-syn and tau. However, the interactions between \u03b1-syn and tau proteins, if any, are not specific to PD and do not contribute to the pathogenesis of PD, since the strong correlation was also observed in the HC group (Fig. 2) . Rather, differences in the interaction between \u03b1-syn and tau species or A\u03b2 1-42 may contribute to the variable progression and/or differential clinical and pathological features of PD [38] . In some autopsy studies of PD, topographical distribution of amyloid pathology and tau pathology were significantly correlated with rapid development of PD dementia [6, 19, 38] . In fact, when we classified PD patients by quintile levels of CSF biomarkers, PD patients with low A\u03b2 1-42 and a high t-tau/A\u03b2 1-42 ratio, but not \u03b1-syn levels, showed more severe clinical symptoms compared with patients with high CSF A\u03b2 1-42 concentrations and low t-tau/A\u03b2 1-42 ratio values (Table 4 ). This suggested that the more severe non-motor symptoms may in part be driven by concurrent amyloid and tau rather than Lewy body pathology. The positive association between \u03b1-syn and tau species was observed not only in PPMI subjects but also in other disease cohorts, such as AD in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) subjects [37] , although the directions of alteration of CSF \u03b1-syn and tau species in PD are opposite to those in AD. However, in some cognitively impaired ADNI subjects with high CSF tau levels, there was a reduction in CSF \u03b1-syn raising the possibility that these individuals may have CNS LBs/LNs in addition to AD pathology, but more longitudinal studies of the ADNI cohort are needed to establish this with certainty.\nFuture long-term longitudinal observations in the PPMI cohort will be required to test the predictive performance of these biomarkers. The presence of AD pathology and interaction with LB pathology in the brain of PD patients (high CSF t-tau and low A\u03b2 , but low \u03b1-syn) may be a contributor to rapid progression of cognitive decline in PD patients as compared to PD patients who do not have AD pathology. In the PPMI dataset, we are able to explore whether these contributing pathological processes may already be contributing to early clinical phenotypes, even given the narrow range of variability in cognitive and motor measures in de novo PD. In the multivariate regression analysis with adjustment for confounders, \u03b1-syn, A\u03b2 1-42 , t-tau or t-tau/\u03b1-syn ratio was significantly associated with multiple clinical measures, while t-tau, p-tau, p-tau/\u03b1-syn or A\u03b2 1-42 /\u03b1-syn was associated with single measure. The lower levels of A\u03b2 were significantly associated with poor daily activity (low MSEADL score), executive functioning (low SDMT score) and lower DAT score in caudate, and lower levels of \u03b1-syn were significantly associated with poor semantic fluency, visuospatial cognition (low BJLO score), executive functioning and worse anxiety (high STAI score), while high level of t-tau/\u03b1-syn ratio was significantly associated with low SDMT and BJLO scores and high STAI score. It has been reported that scales for activity of daily living (e.g., UPDRS II or MSEADL score) were predictors of earlier need for symptomatic treatment (i.e., rapid progression) of PD [25, 26] . In addition, recent studies reported that lower levels of CSF A\u03b2 1-42 [5, 35] or higher amyloid plaque burden on PET imaging [9] in PD is a predictor of rapid cognitive decline. We anticipate that these cross-sectional changes in cognitive and functional measures, together with CSF biomarkers suggesting underlying AD pathology, will identify those PD patients likely to show more rapid decline in these non-motor measures. We observed a significant difference in CSF \u03b1-syn levels between TD and non-TD motor phenotype of PD, but not in CSF A\u03b2 1-42 , t-tau or p-tau levels. However, when we evaluated this in a subset population (TD = 250, non-TD = 98) that had removed subjects (N = 102) reported in our preliminary study [18] , the significant difference of \u03b1-SYN level between TD and non-TD disappeared, implying that the significant finding of \u03b1-SYN is mostly specific to the subset of patients included in our preliminary study. Several studies suggest that motor phenotype of PD could be a good predictor of PD progression [16, 41] . However, the motor phenotype in PD, particularly at a very early stage, might not be stable, and many patients with TD or IND phenotype can change to PIGD phenotype before the development of dementia [3] . Therefore, the motor phenotype at early-stage PD may have limited ability to predict disease progression. Although longitudinal data for the whole PPMI cohort is essential to evaluate the predictive performance of CSF biomarkers for PD progression, the baseline data in this large cohort suggest that CSF biomarkers in early PD subjects already distinguish subtle baseline differences and therefore may have predictive value for disease progression.\nA significant association of APOE genotypes with CSF level of A\u03b2 1-42 , but not other biomarkers was observed. Because the \u03b54 allele is well known to promote A\u03b2 pathology and plaque burden, but is not directly related to PD [39] , we would predict that amyloid pathology may be a mediator of cognitive performance in PD. In support of this, a recent longitudinal study in a large cohort reported that APOE \u03b54 allele was associated with lower performance over time of memory, attention, executive functioning and language processing in PD patients, whereas the MAPT and SNCA genetic variants were not [21] . In addition, a metaanalysis published in 2009 reported a significant association of APOE \u03b54 allele with dementia in PD patients [42] . However, it should be noted that the association of APOE genotypes with cognitive function in PD has to be carefully interpreted, since we found a significant association of APOE \u03b54 allele with lower levels of CSF A\u03b2 . The association of APOE genotype with cognitive, motor and other clinical indices in our PD patients was not significant. Therefore, our results suggest that lower level of CSF A\u03b2 1-42 is more directly mediating cognitive dysfunction in PD than APOE \u03b54 genotype. The frequency of SNPs in the SNCA rs356181 allele of the PD subjects was significantly different from that observed in HC, consistent with previous GWAS results [24] . However, we did not observe significant effects of individual SNPs or haplotypes of SNCA and MAPT genes on the CSF levels of \u03b1-syn and tau species, respectively.\nThere are a number of study limitations. Although the PPMI cohort is the largest ongoing, prospective, longitudinal, qualified cohort, the number of subjects in subgroup analysis (e.g., subgroup of motor phenotypes or genotypes) may be a limitation for the analysis. In addition, we tried to compare the CSF biomarker levels in PD patients according to their motor phenotypes. A major limitation of this analysis, however, is that the motor phenotypes of many patients are not yet fully determined (i.e., IND phenotype or possible change of phenotype over time) and the clinical assessments of non-motor symptoms were limited. More importantly, the current results are cross-sectional, and not longitudinal data analyses. Thus, we are limited at this time in our attempts to directly test for the predictive performance of CSF biomarkers for heterogeneous PD progression. However, in spite of the limited variability in cognitive, motor and clinical measures, our data suggest that CSF biomarkers could help dissect disease heterogeneity that may already be developing at this stage of early motor stages of PD. We anticipate that maturation of the PPMI study with long-term longitudinal follow-up observation will expand on these findings and resolve these limitations."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "2014009392 from the National Research Foundation of Korea, Minis"}]
