[{"section_title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "text": "The latest 2019-nCoV, now officially known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was established as the responsible pandemic. Infections of (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported in more than 200 countries including Pakistan [1] . The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 to be published from Pakistan and is now available on NCBI https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MT240479, GISAID and NEXTRAIN. Coronaviruses, a genus belonging to the Coronaviridae family, contain the largest genome (26.4 kb to 31.7 kb) of RNA viruses with a diameter of 120-160 nm, consisting of a single-stranded positive-sense RNA molecule [2] The broad genome has given this family of viruses extra plasticity in their adaptation and alteration of genes. The G + C content of coronavirus genomes ranges from 32% TO 43% The genome consists of seven genes arranged in sequence [5\u2032replicase ORF1ab, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapside (N)-3\u2032] with small untranslated regions in both termini and additional ORFs in each subgroup of coronavirus. [3, 4] 5 'Non-structural protein coding regions consisting of two-thirds genome replicase genes 1 and structural and non-essential gene. 2-7 regions consisting of structural and non-essential protein coding regions [5] . The genes are translated from genomic mRNA 2 -7. Subgenomic RNAs encode the main Surface Proteins (S), Envelope Protein (E), Membranes Protein (M), and Nucleocapside Protein [6] . Surface protein of SARS CoV-2 join ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme2) and to infect cells. After this initial process, Surface Protein must be produced with an enzyme known as protease to complete entry into the cell. SARS CoV-2 uses TMPRSS 2 in the same way as SARS-CoV is used to complete this process [8] Surface Glycoproteins are outside of the virion and give the typical shape to the virion. The S proteins form homotrimers that allow sun-like morphologies to be developed that give the name Coronaviruses via the Cterminal transmembrane regions, S proteins bind to the virion membrane and interact with M proteins. Virions can be attached through the N-terminus of the S proteins to different surface receptors in the host cell's plasma membrane. The S protein is the receptor-binder and viral input in host cells and is therefore a major therapeutic objective [9] . Membrane Glycoproteins proteins inside the Golgi system are glycosylated. The modification of the M protein is essential for the virion to attach into the cell and make antigenic protein [10] . The protein M plays a key role in the cell's regeneration of virions. N protein forms a complex by binding to In this paper, we tried to describe the four structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 by the use of bioinformatics tools II. MATERIALS AND METHODS Four structural proteins of SARS COV-2 included in this research named as surface glycoprotein (QIQ22760.1), envelop glycoprotein (QIQ22762.1), nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (QIQ22768.1), membrane glycoprotein (QIQ22763.1) available in the NCBI was retrieved. For further study of bioinformatics, the FASTA sequence was selected and used."}, {"section_title": "Protein statistics", "text": "Using the Protparam method, protein statistics were reviewed.

Depending on the Global Model Quality Estimation (GMQE) and QMEAN, the top-ranked models are further analyzed and sorted. GMQE is a quality estimate that combines the targettemplate alignment properties with the template search method. The corresponding GMQE value is given as 0 to 1. The QMEAN Z-score gives a global estimation of the \"degree of nativeness\" of the structural characteristics observed in the model and is described in Benkert et al. III.

CONCLUSIONS The physical parameters shows that Surface protein contain highest amino acids, negatively charged residues, positively charged residues, EC and molecular weight than other proteins. The chemical factors show in proteins phenyl alanine and serine is totally absent in all structural proteins, there is a lack of histidine and glutamic acid in the protein envelope and a lack of cysteine in the nucleocapside phosphoprotein. The envelope, surface and membrane glycoprotein is rich in Leucine so have more affinity to the host cell receptor surface as stated in Luo et al, 1999. Although glycine is more in nucleocapside phosphoprotein, researchers should be able to isolate the protein with little effort along with these data and iso-electric point value. Higher molecular weight of the surface glycoprotein suggests that its tertiary structure may contain strong amino acid side chains. Instability index surface, membrane and envelop glycoprotein is stable and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein is highly unstable Leaving the surface Glycoprotein and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein all other protein are hydrophobic in nature. The prediction of trans-membrane in all structural proteins except Nucleocapsid Phosphoprotein shows the virus ability to reach the host with ease. This fairly simple method may help us understand how antivirals and vaccines could be produced against it Furthermore, as a beginning for docking studies (small and large scale) we are now offering homology models, Diverse knowledge of the molecular biology of SARS COV_2 is required to learn more.\nDeveloping technologies will gain valuable insight into the structure of the protein in order to determine how protein disease induces, and understanding the relationship between protein-protein and protein RNA would greatly enhance our ability to develop vaccines. Meanwhile, methods of molecular simulation provide important solutions to the struggle "}]
