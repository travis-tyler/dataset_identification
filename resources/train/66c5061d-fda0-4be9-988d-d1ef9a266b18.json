Some infants start speaking before their first birthday, while others don't produce words until the end of the second year (Fenson, Marchman, Thal, Dale, Reznick, & Bates, 2007) . Although some late talkers catch up in vocabulary a few months later, others continue to show slower trajectories of language growth and achieve lower levels of language proficiency (Bates, Dale, & Thal, 1995; Fernald & Marchman, 2012) . Differences in socioeconomic status (SES) are strongly associated with variation in language outcomes. By the time they enter kindergarten, children from disadvantaged backgrounds differ substantially from their more advantaged peers in verbal and other cognitive abilities (Ramey & Ramey, 2004) , disparities that are predictive of later academic success or failure (Lee & Burkam, 2002) . In adults as well, SES differences in language proficiency are robust (Pakulak & Neville, 2010) , reflecting the cumulative influence of a wide range of endogenous and environmental factors over a lifetime.\nDespite such evidence for significant differences among children in early language learning, research on acquisition has tended to focus much more on elucidating common patterns of language growth than on understanding the causes and consequences of variability. This emphasis has been driven by several factors: First, the search for similarities rather than differences among children is grounded in a philosophy of science that underlies psychological research more broadlyone that gives priority to processes assumed to be universal rather than to endogenous and experiential factors that can lead to variability (Arnett, 2008) . Second, the use of controlled experimental methods in research on early language development favors betweengroup comparisons of infants at different ages, with limited attention to variability within age groups (Fernald, 2010) . Third, the vast majority of developmental studies in the US rely on 'convenience samples' of children from higher-SES families that are unrepresentative of the larger population and thus are inherently restricted in variability (Henrich, Heine, & Norenzayan, 2010) . Fourth, although educational researchers have documented robust differences in verbal abilities among school-age children varying in SES (e.g. Dickinson & Tabors, 2001; Lee & Burkam, 2002) , this literature is often viewed as 'applied' research with limited relevance to 'basic' research on language development. We argue here that understanding the extent and origins of variability among children in the emergence of early language proficiency should be central to any developmental theory that acknowledges, at whatever level, the influence of children's early experience on language growth.\nThis perspective motivates the current study of differences as well as similarities in early language proficiency among children from higher-and lower-SES families. In experimental studies using looking-time measures, we have shown that infants develop speed and efficiency in interpreting spoken language in real time (Fernald, Pinto, Swingley, Weinberg, & McRoberts, 1998) and that individual differences in early processing efficiency are strongly linked to variation in children's later language outcomes (e.g. Fernald, Perfors, & Marchman, 2006; . However, in these previous studies, as in many other university-based studies with English-learning children, most participants came from highly-educated and affluent families. The goal of the present study was to examine the development of language processing efficiency in relation to vocabulary learning in English-learning infants from families varying in SES. Using real-time processing measures, we followed children longitudinally from 18 to 24 months, focusing on two sets of questions: First, to what extent do infants across this broader SES range show parallel gains in processing efficiency and vocabulary between 18 and 24 months? And second, is there evidence that SES-related differences in processing skills critical to language development are already present in infancy?"}, {"section_title": "SES differences in verbal abilities and their long-term consequences", "text": "The finding that children from disadvantaged families start kindergarten with lower language and cognitive skills than those from more advantaged families is old news, emerging repeatedly in studies since the 1950s (e.g. Bereiter & Englemann, 1966; Deutsch, Katz, & Jensen, 1968) . The robustness of such differences is confirmed in more recent research such as the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K), a comprehensive analysis of young children's achievement scores in literacy and mathematics based on a large and nationally representative sample (Lee & Burkam, 2002) . Even before they entered kindergarten, children in the highest SES-quintile group had scores that were 60% above those in the lowest group. In terms of effect size, children in the highest SES-quintile scored .7 standard deviation (SD) units above middle-SES children in reading achievement, while children in the lowest SESquintile scored almost .5 SD units below the middle-SES mean. Moreover, the disparities in children's cognitive performance at kindergarten entry that were attributable to SES differences were significantly greater than those associated with race/ethnicity. Another recent study found that 65% of low-SES preschoolers in Head Start programs had clinically significant language delays (Nelson, Welsh, Vance Trup, & Greenberg, 2011) . This research revealed a systematic relation between degree of language delay and other weaknesses in academic and socio-emotional skills that were well established by 4 years of age. Socioeconomic gradients in language proficiency are also found within populations living in extreme poverty (L. Fernald, Weber, Galasso, & Ratsifandrihamanana, 2011) .\nA challenging and controversial question: when do SES differences begin to emerge?\nResults showing that SES differences in verbal abilities are already evident in the preschool years suggest that these disparities must start to develop in the first years of life, setting children on particular trajectories with farreaching consequences for later academic success. How early do such differences begin to emerge? Research on this important developmental question has been limited for a variety of reasons -ranging from methodological challenges in evaluating language proficiency in young children, to the complexities of engaging in debate about politically sensitive issues related to social stratification. The methodological problem is easy to characterize: Until recently, measures available for assessing language and cognitive proficiency in children younger than 3 years have not been high in predictive validity, limiting their effectiveness in linking characteristics in infancy to long-term outcomes. But with the refinement of more sensitive methods for evaluating early language, recent studies have revealed considerable variability in verbal skills among very young children -to be reviewed in the following section. Another set of issues that has discouraged research on early origins of cognitive differences among children from different backgrounds is more difficult to characterize. The legacy of a prolonged and bitter debate about the nature of racial and SES differences in the US has reinforced the reluctance of researchers to pursue the question of early origins of SES-related disparities in cognitive skills that are relevant to school success.\nA brief history of this complex debate is relevant to the issues raised in the current study. The scientific consensus in the early 20th century was that cognitive abilities were entirely genetically determined, a view that changed gradually with mounting evidence that experiential factors were also influential (see Fernald & Weisleder, 2011) . By the 1960s, when the Civil Rights movement focused national attention on inequities in educational opportunities for Black children, there was intense interest in eliminating achievement gaps that could no longer be ignored. Riessman (1962) argued that SES disparities in school success resulted from cultural differences in minority children's early experience with parents in the home, rather than from immutable genetic differences. This 'cultural deprivation' argument appeared to offer hope for solutions through appropriate intervention, although characterizing the home environment of minority children as deficient in cognitive stimulation clearly had negative implications. While this idea rallied political support for new programs such as Operation Head Start, what came to be known as the 'deficit model' also generated intense controversy among educators who objected that parents should not be blamed for their children's difficulties in school. By the 1970s, politically motivated backlash to the deficit model converged with the rise of nativist theories of language development, which focused on modal patterns of development presumed to be universal rather than on differences among children. Fernald and Weisleder (2011) argue that this convergence was influential in curtailing debate on questions that had generated extensive research over the previous two decadesnamely, whether SES differences in children's verbal abilities are rooted to some extent in differences in their early language experience at home, and if so, whether these experiential differences contribute to the substantial disparities observed among children in their later academic success.\nAlthough interest in variability in language learning had declined substantially by the 1980s, a few researchers began to explore in greater depth the potential contributions of early parent-child interaction to differences in language development (e.g. Hart & Risley, 1995; Hoff-Ginsberg, 1998; Huttenlocher, Haight, Bryk, & Seltzer, 1991) . Based on detailed analyses of mothers' speech to infants at home, these studies used longitudinal designs to identify features of maternal speech that predict language outcome measures. Hart and Risley found that by 36 months, the higher-SES children in their sample spoke twice as many words as the lower-SES children. But their most remarkable finding was the extreme variation in amounts of child-directed speech among families at different SES levels, differences that were correlated with children's early vocabulary and were also predictive of later school performance (Walker, Greenwood, Hart, & Carta, 1994) . According to Hoff (2003) , it was the quality of infants' early language environment that actually mediated the link between SES and children's vocabulary knowledge."}, {"section_title": "Assessing differences in language proficiency in very young children", "text": "These studies of variability in early language environments with small samples of families laid the foundation for research exploring the early emergence of cognitive disparities in much larger and more diverse samples of advantaged and disadvantaged children. Farkas and Beron (2004) examined the monthly growth trajectory of oral vocabulary knowledge in Black and White children from 36 months to 13 years of age, using a large, representative national data set. Their most striking finding was that most of the inequality in vocabulary growth attributable to race and SES differences developed prior to 36 months. Moreover, the magnitude of the Black-White vocabulary gap that was already evident by the age of school-entry remained unchanged through the age of 13 years. These authors concluded that by 36 months, SES differences in children's language experience have already led to significant vocabulary disparities, which then widen further in the preschool years and remain constant thereafter. Data from the NICHD Early Childhood Care Research Network also revealed that a substantial achievement gap between low-income Black and White children was already evident by 3 years, and that family as well as school characteristics contributed to maintaining this gap through elementary school (Burchinal, McCartney, Steinberg, Crosnoe, Friedman, McLoyd, Pianta, & NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 2011) . A third recent study with a large, representative sample from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (ECLS-B) showed that disparities between lower-and higher-SES infants on language and cognitive measures began to emerge by 9 months, and that by 24 months there was a mean difference of .5 SD units between SES groups on the Bayley Cognitive Assessment (Halle, Forry, Hair, Perper, Wandner, Wessel, & Vick, 2009) .\nThese large-sample studies of SES disparities in cognitive skills emerging early in life have all been based on standardized assessments of language abilities, using measures which require the child to follow instructions and execute an unambiguous response by speaking or pointing. But given these task demands, such assessments cannot be used effectively with toddlers younger than 2 years. While parent reports of a child's vocabulary can yield valuable data on early language development (Fenson et al., 2006) , they do not provide a direct measure of the child's response. Until recently, these methodological limitations made it difficult to investigate the origins of individual differences in language proficiency in infants younger than 24 months. However, refinements in experimental techniques now allow researchers to monitor the time course of language comprehension by very young language learners, providing direct measures of early efficiency in language processing in real time.\nRecent experimental studies on language processing in the second and third years have used real-time measures to assess how efficiently children identify the referent of a familiar word in real-time comprehension. In the looking-while-listening (LWL) procedure (Fernald, Zangl, Portillo, & Marchman, 2008) , children see pictures of two familiar objects as they listen to speech naming one of the objects, and their responses are coded with millisecond-level precision. Cross-sectional studies of both English-and Spanish-learning infants show dramatic gains in the speed and accuracy of language understanding across the second year (Fernald et al., 1998; Hurtado, Marchman, & Fernald, 2007) . Moreover, young children, like adults, are able to interpret incoming language incrementally, directing their attention to the appropriate picture as the speech signal unfolds in time (Fernald, Swingley, & Pinto, 2001; Swingley, Pinto, & Fernald, 1999) . In a longitudinal study with Englishlearning toddlers from 15 to 24 months, these online processing measures were found to be stable over time, and processing speed at 24 months was robustly correlated with vocabulary growth over this period (Fernald et al., 2006) . Moreover, a follow-up study with the same children 6 years later showed strong links between processing efficiency in infancy and performance on standardized tests of language and cognitive skills in elementary school . These real-time processing measures have revealed consistent concurrent and predictive relations to language outcomes across studies of typically developing children. They are also high in predictive validity in research with late-talkers, children at increased risk for persistent language delays (Fernald & Marchman, 2012) . For these reasons, the LWL task is well suited for investigating both similarities and differences in early language processing skill among infants from different socioeconomic backgrounds."}, {"section_title": "Research questions", "text": "The main goals in this research were to examine the early development of language processing efficiency in relation to vocabulary learning in English-learning infants from families across a broad demographic range, and to determine whether SES differences in processing efficiency are already evident in infancy, at a younger age than has been reported in previous research. Our previous studies with English-learning children were all conducted at a university laboratory in a prosperous urban area, where almost all the families who volunteer to participate in research are affluent and highly educated (Site 1). To extend beyond this convenience sample of high-SES families, we needed to establish an additional research site in an area where it is possible to recruit equivalent numbers of lower-and middle-SES English-speaking families. Site 2 is located in an urban area comparable in population size to Site 1. However, because these two areas differ substantially in terms of median family income, cost-of-living, and percentage of children living in poverty, as shown in Table 1 , we are able to include a much more diverse sample of Englishlearning children at Site 2 than is possible at the university lab."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Participants were 48 English-learning children (26 females), recruited through birth records and day care centers at Site 1 (n = 20) and Site 2 (n = 28).

Table 2 also shows scores on the Hollingshead Four Factor Index of Socioeconomic Status (HI; Hollingshead, 1975) .

The HI is divisible into five 'strata' of social status: unskilled worker, semi-skilled worker, skilled worker, semi-professional, and major professional. In this sample, parents' occupations spanned the full range from unskilled worker to major professional.

Interspersed among the critical trials were four filler trials (e.g. Do you like those pictures?).

Indeed, at 18 months, nearly half the children in the Lower-SES group (n = 12) had fewer than 50 words in their reported vocabulary, while only eight children in the Higher-SES group had scores of 50 words or less. A similar trend was evident at 24 months: Children from Higher-SES families produced nearly 450 words, on average, while children from Lower-SES families produced about 150 fewer words, consistent with previous reports of SES differences in reported vocabulary in this age range (e.g. Arriaga, Fenson, Cronan & Pethick, 1998 ).\nAn even more striking result was that the pattern of developmental change in vocabulary differed as a function of SES, reflected in a significant age by SES group interaction, F(1, 46) = 6.1, p < .02, g p 2 = .12.

These results echo the recurring finding that those children who are faster and more accurate in real-time interpretation of familiar words tend to be those who are also reported to produce more words (Fernald et al., 2006; Fernald & Marchman, 2012; Hurtado et al., 2007) ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This research revealed similarities but also striking differences in early language proficiency among infants from advantaged families and from less advantaged families.

Our second goal was to examine SES differences in these crucial aspects of early language development. The most important finding was that significant disparities in language proficiency between infants from higher-and lower-SES families were already evident at 18 months of age, and by 24 months there was a 6-month gap between the two groups.\nSimilarities and differences among children in early processing efficiency and vocabulary\nAlthough participants in this study came from very different backgrounds, they showed common patterns of change in the efficiency of real-time language processing from 18 to 24 months. Older children were more likely than younger children to interpret the incoming speech signal incrementally, fixating the target picture as soon as they had enough information to identify the referent. We also found reliable links between skill in early spoken language processing and vocabulary development, replicating results previously shown in children from affluent, highly educated families (Fernald et al., 2006; Fernald & Marchman, 2012) , but never before in English-learning children from a broader SES range. These results provide further evidence that real-time language processing is aligned with early vocabulary development.\nExtending earlier results showing consistent relations between early processing efficiency and vocabulary size to a more diverse group of English-learning children was an important starting point. However, the more surprising outcome of this study was that by the age of 18 months, there were already substantial differences among children as a function of SES. Children from lower-SES families had significantly lower vocabulary scores than children from higher-SES families at the same age, and they were also less efficient in real-time processing. As seen in Table 4 , mean accuracy for the lower-SES children increased from .59 to .69 between the ages of 18 and 24 months; however, mean accuracy for the higher-SES children was already .69 at 18 months, increasing to .77 by 24 months. Measures of processing speed showed a similar pattern: in the lower-SES children, the mean RT at 24 months (M = 802 ms) was still not as fast as the mean RT at 18 months in the higher-SES children (M = 746 ms). These differences were equivalent to a 6-month disparity between the higher-and lower-SES children, in vocabulary size and in both measures of language processing efficiency."}, {"section_title": "Exploring sources of variability in young children's early language proficiency", "text": "Where do these substantial differences come from? Variability among individuals in verbal abilities is influenced to some extent by genetic factors (Oliver & Plomin, 2007) , but the contributions of early experience to differences in language proficiency are also substantial. Research on language problems in twins has also shown that environmental factors are more powerful than genetic factors in accounting for similarities in language development in children in the same family (Oliver, Dale, & Plomin, 2004) . Other studies suggest that the contribution of environmental factors to variability in IQ has been underestimated in behavioral genetics studies, which tend to focus on children in middle-class families (Rowe, Jacobson, & Van den Oord, 1999; Turkheimer, Haley, Waldron, D'Onofrio, & Gottesman, 2003) . In a study of twins from families diverse in SES, Turkheimer et al. (2003) found that 60% of the variance in cognitive abilities was accounted for by shared environmental factors among children living in poverty, with the genetic contribution close to zero; however, for children in higher-SES families, the opposite pattern of findings emerged. While the power of SES to moderate the heritability of verbal and other cognitive abilities is under debate (Hanscombe, Trzaskowski, Haworth, Davis, Dale, & Plomin, 2012) , there is consensus that infants' genetic potentials in these domains can only be realized with appropriate environmental support. In families where adequate resources and support are consistently available, children are more likely to be buffered from adverse circumstances than are children in impoverished families, and so are more likely to be able to achieve their developmental potential.\nThere are many different experiential factors associated with living in poverty that could contribute to variability in language learning. For example, the physical conditions of everyday life related to safety, sanitation, noise level, and exposure to toxins and dangerous conditions differ dramatically for children in lower-and higher-SES families, as does the access to crucial resources such as adequate nutrition and medical care (Bradley & Corwyn, 2002) . Conditions of social and psychological support vary as well, with higher levels of stress and instability in disadvantaged families (Evans, Gonnella, Marcynyszyn, Gentile & Salpekar, 2005) . All of these environmental factors are known to have consequences for cognitive and social outcomes in young children (e.g. Evans, 2004) . There are also well-known differences in the quality of parent-child interaction among families differing in SES related to these circumstantial factors. For example, parents under greater stress tend to respond less sensitively to their children (Mesman, van IJzendoorn, & Bakermans-Kranenburg, 2011) , and provide less adequate social and cognitive stimulation. This is likely to be one important factor contributing to the well-documented SES differences in the amount and quality of child-directed speech (Hoff, 2003 (Hoff, , 2006 . Hart and Risley (1995) estimated that by 36 months, the children they observed from advantaged families had heard 30 million more words directed to them than those growing up in poverty, a stunning difference that predicted important long-term outcomes (Walker et al., 1994) .\nCould variation in early language experience also contribute to individual differences in infants' real-time processing efficiency, as well as in vocabulary learning? This question was explored in longitudinal research with Spanish-speaking families, examining links between maternal talk, children's processing efficiency, and lexical development (Hurtado, Marchman, & Fernald, 2008) . Those infants whose mothers talked with them more at 18 months were those who learned more vocabulary by 24 months. But the most noteworthy finding was that those infants who experienced more and richer language were also more efficient in real-time language processing 6 months later, compared to those who heard less maternal talk. One interpretation of these findings is that having the opportunity for rich and varied engagement with language from an attentive caretaker provides the infant not only with models for language learning, but also with valuable practice in interpreting language in real time. Thus, child-directed talk sharpens the processing skills used in online comprehension, enabling faster learning of new vocabulary."}, {"section_title": "Long-term consequences of early differences in language skills", "text": "How would an advantage in processing efficiency facilitate vocabulary learning? Studies with adults show that faster processing speed can free additional cognitive resources (e.g. Salthouse, 1996) , which may be particularly beneficial in the early stages of language learning. The infant who can interpret a familiar word more rapidly has more resources available for attending to subsequent words, with advantages for learning new words that come later in the sentence. A slight initial edge in the efficiency of familiar word interpretation could be strengthened through positive-feedback processes, leading to faster growth in vocabulary that in turn leads to further increases in receptive language competence. If rapid lexical access of familiar words facilitates learning new words, then greater efficiency in language processing at 18 and 24 months could have cascading advantages that result in further vocabulary growth.\nResults from several studies support the idea that variability in both processing speed and vocabulary could have long-term consequences. In research with adults and children, mean RT across various tasks predicted success on cognitive assessments at every age (Kail & Salthouse, 1994) . Because mean RT in adults correlates so consistently with measures of memory, reasoning, language, and fluid intelligence, Salthouse (1996) has argued that gradual increases in processing speed account fundamentally for developmental change with age in cognitive and language functioning. This association has been characterized as a developmental cascade by Fry and Hale (1996) , who proposed that increasing processing speed strengthens working memory, and that stronger working memory then leads to greater cognitive competence. Since vocabulary size also predicts IQ in both adults and children (Matarazzo, 1972; Vance, West, & Kutsick, 1989) , an early advantage in lexical development could have cascading benefits for other aspects of language learning as well (Bates, Bretherton, & Snyder, 1988) . Vocabulary knowledge also serves as a foundation for later literacy (Lonigan, Burgess, & Anthony, 2000) , and language proficiency in preschool is predictive of academic success (Alexander, Entwisle, & Horsey, 1997). It is clear from these findings that the early emerging differences we found in language proficiency between children from different SES backgrounds have serious implications for their long-term developmental trajectories."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In this research we found significant differences in both vocabulary learning and language processing efficiency that were already present by 18 months, with a 6-month gap emerging between higher-and lower-SES toddlers by 24 months. These results mirror findings from new analyses of the ECLS-B data set, which used more global measures to show that reliable differences in cognitive performance between children in lower-and higher-SES families were present by 24 months (Halle et al., 2009; Tucker-Drob, Rhemtulla, Harden, Turkheimer, & Fask, 2011) . What our findings add is the first evidence that SES-related disparities in language skills emerge at an even earlier age. Using high-precision measures of infants' real-time responses to familiar words, it was not until 24 months that the less advantaged children reached the same levels of speed and accuracy achieved by more advantaged children at 18 months, a 6-month gap in the development of processing efficiency. Such a large disparity cannot simply be dismissed as a transitory delay, given that differences among children in trajectories of language growth established by 3 years of age tend to persist and are predictive of later school success or failure (Burchinal et al., 2011; Farkas & Beron, 2004) .\nBecause this difference can be characterized as a lag in early processing efficiency with potentially important long-term consequences, it is important to frame this finding in light of scientific discoveries that reveal the weaknesses of the controversial 'deficit model' of the 1960s. The view that children from disadvantaged homes were inherently 'culturally deprived' (Riessman, 1962) was based on a vague notion of culture as embodied in middle-class practices, institutions, and values. At that time, little was known about the actual activities and practices of parents in different families, with even less scientific evidence on trajectories of cognitive and language development from infancy through childhood. Thus the term 'deficit' was used as a global indictment of parenting styles in impoverished families that were simply different from middle-class families -a wellintended but misguided attempt to help teachers understand the difficulties minority children were experiencing in the recently desegregated school system.\nThere was obfuscating vagueness on both sides of the debate. Advocates of the deficit model proposed a causal account of the effects of children's early life experience on later cognitive development in which both predictor and outcome variables were poorly specified. While many critics of the deficit model raised valid points urging greater respect for different cultural practices (e.g. Heath, 1983) , others countered with proposals that were simplistic and counterproductive, often reflecting a political agenda. These proposals ranged from calling a halt to research on parenting practices in minority families because it was inherently paternalistic and racist, to focusing on eliminating poverty rather than on 'blaming the victim' (Ryan, 1971 ). The deficit model was incoherent at the time, and the continuing debate on this construct has not led to greater precision or insight (Gorski, 2006) .\nIn an effort to reframe this argument, we end with an example from nutrition, where cognitive consequences can be linked to particular deficits without evoking the reflexive opposition associated with deficit models in social science. Children with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) are typically low in energy and have cognitive difficulties. For many years, the prevailing explanation for these symptoms was that parents treated lethargic children with IDA as if they were younger, which supposedly retarded their cognitive development (Pollitt, 1993) . Thus differences among children in global measures of cognitive ability were attributed to ill-defined problems in parenting behavior. However, recent research on IDA has led to a much more precise specification of both causes and consequences. Studies with animal models show that iron deficiency in pre-and postnatal development disrupts the optimal course of myelination, which then reduces efficiency of neural transmission (Beard, Wiesinger & Connor, 2003) . And longitudinal research measuring brain responses to auditory and visual stimuli shows that children with IDA have slower neural transmission, which is very likely to affect the efficiency of cognitive processing (Algar \u0131n, Peirano, Garrido, Pizarro, & Lozoff, 2003) .\nResting on a foundation of research showing solid relations between a specific causal factor and specific consequences, these discoveries of links between iron deficiency and long-term cognitive difficulties become valuable and highly relevant as public health information. If a mother was told that her child had a 'cultural deficit in nutrition', such a broad, vague claim could only be perceived as a perplexing insult. However, if she heard about new research showing that iron is absolutely critical for optimal brain development in infancy, and that healthy brain development is vital to her child's success in school and in later life, she might be more interested in learning about new ways to provide more iron in her child's diet.\nWhile recent research on nutrition focuses on biological factors that influence early cognitive development, there is increasing scientific evidence that experiential factors also play a critical role in infants' early language development -by nurturing vocabulary learning (Hart & Risley, 1995; Hoff, 2006) as well as strengthening skill in real-time language processing (Hurtado et al., 2008; Weisleder & Fernald, under review) . Although the present study was not designed to explore causes of the variability we found among children, our results add to this literature by showing the potential benefits of early processing efficiency for vocabulary growth, and also revealing the potential cost to children with less efficient processing skills, in terms of missed opportunities for learning. From the perspective of basic research and theory in language acquisition, it is essential to investigate not only the typical developmental trajectories of children from privileged families, but also the wide range of variability that becomes apparent when children from more diverse backgrounds are included. We address this goal here by documenting substantial differences between infants from lower-and higher-SES backgrounds that are already evident in the second year of life, using sensitive measures of early language proficiency known to be predictive of later outcomes. The next step is to explore the powerful sources of variability in early experience that contribute to such differences in infants' emerging language profi-ciency, and to examine the nature and timing of their influence in larger and more diverse samples of children. From a policy perspective, the ultimate challenge is to frame these discoveries as a public health message (Knudsen, Heckman, Cameron, & Shonkoff, 2006) , with the goal of helping caregivers understand the crucial role they can play in enabling infants to build and strengthen skills essential for optimal development."}]
