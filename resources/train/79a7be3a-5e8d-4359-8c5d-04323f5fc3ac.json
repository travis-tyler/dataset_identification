Those gains were achieved through the efforts of many in the science community to promote more diversity in physics, and they track the modern civil-rights movement for women that dates from the early 1970s. Intervention programs introduced girls and young women to the possibilities of nontraditional careers and encouraged them to take more mathematics and science courses. Underrepresented minorities (URMs), defined as African Americans, Hispanics, and American Indians, have received increasing numbers of bachelor's degrees in physics since the 1970s, except for a serious decrease in production for African Americans that began in the late 1990s and continues to this day, albeit with significant fluctuations. The statistics for PhDs paint a less optimistic picture: Both African Americans and Hispanics have earned stagnant or declining numbers of PhDs during the past decade. Physicists need to be aware that the figures I have quoted compare rather unfavorably with those for chemistry. Chemistry doctorates awarded to women by US institutions grew from 6.4% of the total in the 1960s to 10.4% of the total in the 1970s to nearly 20% of the total in the 1980s. In 2004, women received almost 32% of all US chemistry doctorates awarded, a proportion that has been relatively stable since the mid-1990s. At the bachelor's level, women and men receive an approximately equal number of chemistry degrees. Since the 1960s, URMs have increased their percentage of chemistry doctorates, albeit at a slower rate than women. In 2004, African American citizens and permanent residents received 2.3%, Hispanic citizens and permanent residents earned 2.2%, and American Indians received 0.2% of all doctorates awarded. Collectively, URMs accounted for 7.9%, or 93 of 1180 doctorates in chemistry awarded to US citizens and permanent residents.

The French school in Brussels had no real college advising. The best students were encouraged to apply to so-called preparatory schools, where they would suffer for two years while training for the entrance exams to the \"grandes \u00e9coles,\" the best French university programs. Every graduate was automatically eligible for a spot at one of the French public universities. Marcel signed up to attend a university in Paris, but was much more interested in returning to the U.S. Advice on how to get into an American college was almost non-existent. \"We had a few American friends who helped me figure out which tests to take, etc., but it was all very improvised. My teachers didn't speak English, and anyway French universities really don't care about recommendations, so they overstated my qualifications ('one of the ten best students I've ever had!') and had me translate their letters. I arranged to have at least one of my admission interviews in a bar... I could go on, but I don't want to have my B.A. taken away.\" Columbia was one of a handful of colleges that admitted Marcel, perhaps in part because he had very good test scores and perhaps in part because they thought more highly of the French educational system than he did. His first semester at Columbia, Marcel decided to take classes in the areas that interested him when he was 12: astronomy, archeology, and judo. A couple of research experiences helped him decide to major in astronomy, and an REU at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico made the prospect of a life in astronomy both concrete and attractive. \"I loved being at Arecibo. For one, it was only an hour or so (depending on how fast you drove) from my abuela's home in Quebradillas. For another, I really liked the research atmosphere and the astronomers there. I started being able to see myself living and working among these people, and I liked the idea.\" He also started developing an interest in (Continued on page 18) \" For a long time I was an aspiring astronomer because it was different career choice and I liked that, even as I wondered if I could really make it my profession. It's only fairly recently that I've become comfortable with calling myself an astronomer.\" Marcel Ag\u00fceros, a born-and-bred New Yorker, is now back in his hometown as an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellow at Columbia University (his alma mater), but his path from downtown to uptown Manhattan has been full of detours. The son of a Nuyorican father and French mother, Marcel went to French school first in Manhattan and then in Brussels, Belgium, where he moved in 1989, after his parents divorced. A good student in New York, Marcel found adjusting to life in Brussels very difficult, and stayed back his junior year before escaping with a Baccalaur\u00e9at (the French high school degree) in 1992. \"Ultimately I found the French educational system suffocating, and I just didn't deal with the authoritarian side of my high school very well, to say the least. My experiences there had some rather unforeseen consequences. It took me a couple of years of college before I believed that any professor actually was interested in my opinion; in high school the emphasis was on thesis antithesis synthesis, and no one asked what you thought.\" In 1992 there was no prom, no graduation ceremony, no yearbook-none of the fuss associated with senior year in an American high school. \"It's funny, actually. There's now an alumni association that is planning a special reunion for the school's 100th birthday next May. I guess Americanization is inevitable wherever you look!\" Marcel has yet to decide whether he will attend the reunion... \"I'd like to see my biology teacher again. On the first day of my second junior year, she did the roll-call, and then asked if any of us were repeating the year. I dutifully raised my hand, and she said: 'Ah... Ag\u00fceros! but for you it will be as though this is the first time!' I never did do very well in her class.\" If graduating from high school in the summer of 1992 was a small miracle, entering Columbia\nhe moved to Seattle. The transition was not the smoothest, but Marcel was lucky to find a great adviser, mentor, and friend in Scott Anderson, who eventually headed his thesis committee. He also relied on fellow graduate students to help him through the tough times, and credits classmates Anil Seth and Kevin Covey (both now at the CfA) in particular with making graduate school life easier. Marcel's research as a graduate student focused on using correlations of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with surveys at other wavelengths to characterize large numbers of \"ordinary\" objects, while simultaneously searching for rarer ones. His dissertation, titled \"Candidate Isolated Neutron Stars and Other Stellar X-ray Sources from the ROSAT All-Sky and Sloan Digital Sky Surveys,\" used SDSS and 2MASS, along with spectroscopy from the ARC 3.5-m telescope at Apache Point, New Mexico, to construct a catalog of X-rayemitting stars while looking for those much more elusive isolated neutron stars. \"My thesis title is unwieldy but does describe what happens when one works with large surveys. Typically one is more excited about the needles, but still has to spend lots of time describing the haystack...\" SDSS cannot identify isolated neutron stars directly, since these are typically much fainter than the survey's 22 or 23 mag limit, but it can be used to identify more common X-ray emitters (including main sequence stars) and thereby produce, by elimination, a list of possible neutron star candidates. Follow-up observations of these candidates are on-going, and Marcel is hopeful that these may turn out to be useful for constraining the neutron star equation of state. \"There are only seven isolated neutron stars currently known, and while in theory these objects represent one of our best opportunities to examine the neutron star EOS, in practice we really could use a few more to study.\" While at the U.W., Marcel also worked on addressing the historic underrepresentation of women and minorities in astronomy. Along with two other then graduate students, Andrew West and Kevin Covey, he wrote a diversity plan for the department, and later submitted a proposal to the university's administration to fund a new program for (Continued on page 19) the end points of stellar evolution, and in particular in neutron stars, the area of research he has spent most of his time exploring. Back from Puerto Rico, Marcel got to know David Helfand, who has been his most important mentor ever since. \"Joe Patterson, a great teacher, was my first Columbia adviser, and I didn't really meet David until my senior year. Nothing in our early interactions suggested how important David's friendship and advice would become to me, but as it turns out there hasn't been a professional decision I've made over the last ten years where I haven't consulted him. I'm incredibly grateful for everything he's done for me.\" While majoring in astronomy, Marcel also completed the requirements to be certified to teach high school physics, which included a semester student-teaching at Frederick Douglass Academy in Harlem. \"I love working with high school students, and I was planning to teach in the public school system for a couple of years after graduation, while I had the energy. Instead I went to England.\" Marcel had received the Euretta J. Kellett Fellowship, through which Columbia funds students for two years of study at either Cambridge or that other place. In the fall of 1996, Marcel moved to England to enter Emmanuel College, and was soon working on an M.Phil. at the Cavendish Laboratory under the supervision of Dave Green-a supervisor suggested by David Helfand. \"An M.Phil. is a research degree, and so I spent a year working with data taken with one of our observatory's radio interferometers to measure the expansion of supernova remnant Cassiopeia A. It was a very useful experience for gauging my interest in obtaining a Ph.D., and I loved working with Dave, but when I was done I decided I wasn't quite ready yet.\" It took a few years of wandering (including six months in South Asia and a year in Paris) before Marcel decided to come back to the U.S. for a Ph.D. \"David and I sat on a bench outside of the old Observatory in Cambridge and he listed the places he thought I'd be happy. The University of Washington was one of the places he mentioned, and if he hadn't, there's no way I would've thought of applying.\" A visit in 1999 to the U.W. was enough to convince Marcel, and in the fall of 2000 tures to better meet student, faculty and staff needs. Take a glimpse at a few special programming efforts, and get helpful hints about such things as the incentives, resources, and constraints involved with them. Chapter Eight: Summing Up: Diversity is at the Heart of Education Those who support the aims and principles of diversity, as well as those who decry them, agree that campuses face a variety of challenges in their ef-(Continued from page 7) forts to make education a truly inclusive option. But are these threats worth it? Reviewing the lessons learned through the university's experience and analysis, along with their general suggestions about how to begin, expand, or alter your institution's diversity program and policies, ultimately lend an urgency to transform our campuses into communities that welcome and support all our citizens in the education enterprise."}, {"section_title": "Institutions That Serve Minorities", "text": "Historically black colleges and universities and Hispanic-serving institutions have had a disproportionate impact in producing URM baccalaureate degree holders.   Report, 2003.) school preparation, science aptitude, and interest must be responsible for the low achievement and low persistence in these subgroups of undergraduate and graduate S&E students. Identifying these negative factors and retaining well-educated students with S&E interests would improve the United States' ability to compete in today's global scientific community. Factors that keep URMs from persisting with science include academic and cultural isolation, motivation and performance vulnerability in the face of low expectations, peers who are not supportive of academic success, and discrimination, whether perceived or actual (10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15). These factors can have a stronger effect at institutions with predominantly majority populations. Such institutions award about 75% of all bachelor's degrees earned by African Americans (16). To address these particular factors, we developed the Meyerhoff Scholars Program in 1989 at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). At that time, the university was graduating fewer than 18 African-American S&E majors per year (see graph below). Typically, fewer than five of these students graduated with a grade point average above 3.0 (on a 1 to 4 scale), consistent with achievement levels observed at other institutions (17,18). The Meyerhoff Scholars Program (named after Baltimore philanthropists Robert and Jane Meyerhoff) focuses on producing bachelor's degree recipients, particularly African Americans, who go on to doctoral programs in science and engineering. Since 2000, an average of 1900 candidates have been nominated each year by high school teachers and counselors. Of those nominated, the 80% who are from Maryland (~1500) represent about 2% of graduating high school students in Maryland. We typically invite about 180 students and their parents to UMBC for interviews, and offer 4-year scholarships to about 100 of them. About half accept. Most students who decline the Meyerhoff program accept other scholarships at UMBC or other institutions. Transfer students, typically not more than two per year, can join the program later. The program has supported 768 students, 260 of whom are currently undergraduates. Most of the Meyerhoff graduates (435 of 508 students, 86%) (Continued on page 14) suing scientific or engineering careers. In 2005, the same percentage (44%) of African-American and Caucasian college-bound high school students indicated their intent to major in S&E fields (8). Many students with strong SAT scores, impressive grades, and success in high school honors math and science courses leave the college science pipeline, but the loss is disproportionately among women and minorities (9,10).

U.S. Doctorates in the 20th Century reveals many factors about who is educated and where. It also describes the complex changes taking place in the pursuit of doctoral degrees, many in new interdisciplinary fields. For example, relatively small Oberlin College in Ohio provided the baccalaureate origins of more science and engineering doctorates over an 80-year period (nearly 2,800) than the University of Nebraska, Duke University, Johns Hopkins University, Virginia Tech and the University of Iowa. Another example is that five of the eight leading doctorate-granting universities from 1920-1999 were Midwest-based, Big Ten schools. Prior to that period, the majority of doctorate-granting institutions were East Coast institutions. \"The report shows how much has changed in doctoral education in just 25 years,\" says Susan T. Hill, director of the Doctorate Data Project in NSF's Division of Science Resources Statistics. \"For one thing, nearly two-thirds of all doctorates awarded in this country occurred in the last 25 years of the 20th century. Second, the United States has become an educator of the world, expanding its role in providing doctorates to foreign-born and U.S. students. Third, the U.S. system reveals a great flexibility in opening varied pathways for Ph.D. recipients into career opportunities both in and outside their fields. This has increased U.S. innovation, competitiveness and leadership in many fields.\" The report is based on the Survey of Earned Doctorates, which had a 95 percent response rate.

The interactions of all these elements are ultimately reflected in measures of the elapsed time it takes to complete the doctorate.

The rapid increase in the numbers of women earning doctorates, beginning in the 1960s, increased their share of doctorates from 15 percent in the early 1920s to 41 percent in the late 1990s. Citizenship Status. In the late 1980s about one in four Ph.D.s was a foreign national; by the 1990s this proportion had increased to almost one in three. Most foreign doctorate recipients were on temporary visas, most were men, and most studied S&E fields. Race/Ethnicity. Minorities accounted for nearly 14 percent of all S&E doctorates awarded to U.S. citizens in 1995-99, compared with about 6 percent in 1975-79, when data on race/ethnicity were first collected in the SED. Among U.S. citizens, minorities also increased their share of non-S&E doctorates from less than 10 percent in 1975-79 to more than 14 percent in 1995-99. Parents' Education. Rising educational attainment in the U.S. population as a whole is reflected in the Ph.D. population. Data on the educational attainment of the parents of Ph.D.s became available in 1965. On the whole, the level of educational attainment for families of doctorate recipients is higher than the national average. By 1995-99 more than one-third (nearly 35 percent) of new Ph.D.s came from families in which both the mother and the father had a college degree. Nearly half of doctorate recipients in 1999 had a parent who held a bachelor's or advanced degree, compared with less than one-fifth of parent equivalents (those 55 or older, the assumed age of Ph.D.s' parents) in the U.S. population. In contrast, 30 years earlier, almost half of new Ph.D.s came from families in which neither parent had attended college. Among doctorate recipients in general, the father's educational level was higher than the mother's. Path to the Doctorate: Time to Doctorate Many factors, including domestic and international conditions, influence the time it takes graduate students to earn the doctorate. Furthermore, fields differ in terms of the availability of financial support for full-time graduate study, and Maryland's innovative and comprehensive approach to educating the campus about multicultural issues. It \"explores and enhances common values that emphasize interdependence, equality, justice, human rights, and the sanctity of each individual's dignity.\" The goal is to make the university a more welcoming and inclusive community for all. Setting priorities and using the diversity planning principles maximize our efforts to achieve this success. D iversity Blueprint is a \"how-to\" planning resource for administrators, faculty and staff working to create campus diversity policies based on the following priorities:"}, {"section_title": "Chapters", "text": "\u2022 "}, {"section_title": "Concept", "text": "To create a diversity plan, each college or university must first define its culture and then use those findings to set the tone to conduct needed research, determine institutional priorities, and take action. For the University of Maryland, five diversity planning principles have provided the structure and process to guarantee that diversity would become and remain an institutional priority. The five principles -accountability, inclusiveness, shared responsibility, institutionalization, and evaluation -not only helped set the structural development for diversity planning, but enabled the university to successfully engage with the campus community, the Maryland community, and the nation in addressing issues of diversity. Setting priorities can also help an institution identify specific programs and actions needed to achieve change. The five priorities usually considered by an institution undergoing diversity reform are: leadership and systemic change; recruitment, retention and affirmative action; curriculum transformation; campus-community connections; and faculty, staff, and student involvement. Initial research at the University of Maryland revealed a comprehensive list of priority areas to include in the change process, and signaled the need for an institutionalized structure to address the priorities. Born out of the numerous internal struggles and external pressures to change with the times, the Diversity Initiative grew from this need. The Diversity Initiative is the University of forgets the historical (and continuing) struggles of people seeking equal opportunity in our society, which is still segregated by race, class, gender, disability, religion and sexual orientation.

Research-intensive institutions played a less prominent role in the undergraduate education of blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians/Alaskan Natives than in the undergraduate education of whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders. Location, on the other hand, seems to have played a significant role for underrepresented minorities.   3 It is not reasonable to expect growth in the URM PhD population without first addressing the small number of physics bachelor's degrees awarded. And perhaps it is not reasonable to expect an increased number of bachelor's degrees in light of experiences in K-12 schools, uneven career guidance, small numbers of visible role models, and few institutions with significant degree output. Those factors combine to decrease the pool of interested and well-prepared students who can consider advanced study in physics. Among those graduating high school in 2000, only 26% of African Americans and 26% of Hispanics took any physics classes. In comparison, 62% of African Americans and 56% of Hispanics took chemistry courses. 4 Behind those numbers is the issue of the nature and quality of science education at elementary-and middle-school levels, including the extent to which physics concepts are being taught. Research suggests that K-12 schools largely attended by minority students have higher proportions of instructors teaching subjects they were not trained to teach. 5 The problems related to the nation's overall scarcity of certified physics teachers are likely magnified for schools with significant African American, Hispanic, and American Indian enrollment. The gap between males and females taking at least some physics classes in high school is closing; 36% of males in the class of 2000 reported taking some physics, as did 32% of females. But both overall numbers remain unacceptably low. Compare them with the 58% of males and 67% of females who took chemistry. Clearly, most students graduate high school with no formal instruction in physics. That means low levels of physics literacy among the adult population. Or does it?

The problems that have led from physics as a part of what it means to be human to physics as a community lacking diversity can be fixed. But, I contend, the issue is a systems problem, and it can respond only to a thoughtful suite of interventions that begins at the earliest grade level and moves through the professional life span. Those interventions would include at least the following components: \u2022 Education and professional development so that those who teach physics are confident and comfortable teaching physics concepts. \u2022 High-quality, hands-on, inquiry-based science for the primary grades. \u2022 Development and dissemination of high-quality, research-based curricula for the middle grades. \u2022 Experimentation with curriculum and instructional models, including such strategies as \"physics first,\" to increase the number and diversity of students taking physics in high school (see ref. 6 "}, {"section_title": "Meet Marcel Ag\u00fceros, NSF Postdoctoral Fellow at Columbia University by Keivan G. Stassun", "text": "Some of the interventions are general and would have a positive impact on the study of physics for all students; ensuring that teachers are comfortable with physics concepts is one example. Other proposals, including focused attention on the needs of female URMs, are targeted. In many instances, people's ability or willingness to implement targeted programming has been dampened by concerns about legal challenges. 7 Rather than seek ways to legally and effectively serve populations most in need, institutions have tended to cancel their efforts or make them \"for all,\" a move that neither increases the number being served nor addresses the special needs faced by those in the minority. Legally responding to the concerns of women and URMs is an issue that deserves more discussion in the physics community. It is crucial that science educators work to maintain the early excitement, interest, and curiosity that children bring with them when they begin school. Nonexistent or poor early science instruction can affect students' attitudes toward science and their future willingness to take elective courses in science. Professional development that allows teachers to learn in the same way they should teach is demonstrably effective. Programs such as the Teachers Academy of Math and Science in Chicago and La Main \u00e0 la P\u00e2te, begun in France but now operating worldwide, focus on enhancing the interactions between scientists and educators and encourage the use of handson, inquiry-based strategies that move from phenomena to concepts. Many of the topics they recommend are from physics. Wherever the projects are in use, their results are universally engaging for children. Lederman's physics-first concept, in which physics is a required first course rather than an elective capstone course, changes how the student relates to the disciplines of physics, chemistry, and biology.

He found (Continued on page 16) physics experiences such as those offered in science and technology centers, after-school programs, and camps. \u2022 Support of physics programs in institutions that serve URMs. \u2022 Increased recruitment of bachelor's-level URM and women students for summer internships and research opportunities. \u2022 Transfer of effective models from highproduction to low-production institutions. \u2022 Exploration of the efficacy of mentoring or a community of colleagues to improve the retention of women and URMs in graduate school. \u2022 Understanding of the departmental climate as a factor in increasing student diversity. \u2022 Awards and recognition for individuals and departments that effectively mentor URMs. \u2022 Support, through professional organizations, for the professional development of women, URMs, and persons with disabilities as well as for those who teach and advise them. \u2022 Equal opportunities for employment and advancement. \u2022 Focused attention on the needs of female URMs in physics at all levels.  The program encourages students to pursue academic goals, earn top grades, and prepare for graduate school. Students participate in study groups and use university resources for tutoring and counseling. Students also mentor and tutor other students on campus as well as children in inner city schools. Group activities such as monthly focus groups to discuss class and research experiences, receptions with mentors and parents, competitive team building events, and group participation at scientific conferences encourage a sense of community among the students, faculty, and staff. As participation in the Meyerhoff program has grown, we have observed a simultaneous increase in S&E participation among UMBC minority students who are not in the Meyerhoff program. The number of African-American undergraduates majoring in science and engineering has increased The effectiveness of the Meyerhoff program is highlighted by comparing students who entered the Meyerhoff program with those who were invited but declined and attended other institutions (9,19,20). Both groups earned similar grades and graduated at similar rates. But students who entered the Meyerhoff program were twice as likely to earn a science or engineering bachelor's degree (9) and 5.3 times more likely to enroll in post-college graduate study (19,20). In addition, Meyerhoff students were about twice as likely to earn S&E B.S. degrees as Asian, Caucasian, and non-Meyerhoff African-American students with similar preparation and interests (9). The Meyerhoff model has four overarching objectives: (a) academic and social integration, (b) knowledge and skill development, (c) support and motivation, and (d) monitoring and advising (9,19,20). Our ongoing evaluation of outcomes leads us to identify five elements as most important for achieving these objectives: (i) recruiting a substantial pool of high-achieving minority students with interests in math and science who are most likely to be retained in the scientific pipeline, (ii) offering merit-based financial support, (iii) providing an orientation program for incoming freshmen, (iv) recruiting the most active research faculty to work with the students (our philosophy is that it takes a scientist to train a scientist), and (v) involving the students in scientific research projects as early as possible, so that they can engage in the excitement of discovery. Encouraging high academic performance in the first 2 years is critical. Students are encouraged to retake courses in which they earn a C in order to strengthen foundation knowledge before advancing to other courses. courses. Research faculty are usually eager to mentor minority students who are academically successful. At the graduate level, departmental leadership is critical, since this is where admissions, mentoring, and candidacy decisions are made. more than sevenfold since 1985 (see Figure 1) whereas overall African-American enrollment increased 1.4-fold. Overall and S&E enrollments among Latino students have also grown (three-and fivefold, respectively) since 1985. The number of Caucasian S&E majors also increased during this time period (from 710 to 1287 students, 1.8-fold) at a rate greater than that of total undergraduate enrollment (from 7914 to 9406 students, 1.2-fold). The average GPA of all African-American S&E graduates has increased from 2.70 in 1989 to 3.21 in 2005, due primarily to the high achievement of the Meyerhoff Scholars (average graduating GPA = 3.42 \u00b1 0.12). The average GPA of Caucasian S&E graduates has remained relatively unchanged (3.17 \u00b1 0.05) (see Figure 1). In the 1990s, participation of URMs in graduate studies at UMBC continued to reflect low national averages (Meyerhoff undergraduates are encouraged to pursue graduate studies elsewhere). To address this, we began the Meyerhoff Graduate Biomedical Fellows Program in 1996. The program includes (i) a prematriculation orientation program; (ii) group social activities, including annual weekend retreats and picnics (with white-water rafting and hiking); (iii) monthly student seminars; (iv) instruction on technical writing and grantsmanship; and (v) financial support for student travel and minority scientist seminars. Efforts to encourage student applications focused on predominantly minority serving campuses. Research opportunities for summer students and undergraduate research symposia were available. Applications from African-American and Latino students went from about 2 per year in 1998 to about 50 per year since 2002, and URM participation has increased by an average of 18% (see Figure 2). Sustaining interest in a scientific career is every bit as important in producing the scientific workforce as is generating the interest and knowledge in the first place. Retention of both undergraduate and graduate students can focus on specific populations. Success depends on addressing both academic and community issues. At the undergraduate level, administrative efforts and resources are needed to attract high-achieving minority S&E students and prepare them for the rigors of college "}, {"section_title": "Preparing Minority Scientists and Engineers (cont'd)", "text": "JANUARY 2007 PAGE 16 Diversity in Physics (cont'd) more students, and a more diverse group of students, were taking more science classes."}, {"section_title": "After the Degree", "text": "Why are some institutions effective in recruiting, retaining, and graduating physics students from diverse populations while others are not? Student potential, the reality of student capacity, the learning environment, the curriculum, and expectations all play a role. But the fact is URM baccalaureate degree recipients in physics come disproportionately from minority-serving institutions. A 2005 talk-back session with newly minted African American PhDs who participated in the Packard graduate scholars program provided insights into the success of minority-serving institutions. The program supported the graduate-level education of science and engineering students who had received their undergraduate degrees from HBCUs. In the talk-back session, scholars contrasted the communities of the black colleges with those of their graduate schools and noted that the HBCUs gave them confidence, encouragement, and tangible proof that African Americans could succeed in science. In a February 2006 Inside Higher Education editorial, Daryl Chubin, who moderated the talkback session, summarized the students' messages and their implications. 8 Gender and race bias, the students found, is a graduate-school reality that has to be managed, and even though successful students devise their own ways to cope, institutions need to consider formal systems to address discrimination. In particular, institutions need to reward outreach and work to develop student diversity. The Packard scholars also noted that they must stay focused on completing the requirements for their doctorate. One important comment Chubin made was that any institution of higher education can effectively serve minorities. A recent article by Michael Summers and Freeman Hrabowski in the journal Science gives an example of a predominantly majority institution, the University of Maryland, Balti- more County, that aspired to and became a minority-serving school. 9 I must note, though, that any prospect for success in increasing diversity is predicated on leadership-having it and nurturing it. In 1876 Edward Bouchet received the first PhD awarded to an African American from a US university. 10 His degree, from Yale University, was in physics. Little in Bouchet's background would have led one to predict that outcome. The son of former slaves, he was able to demonstrate his capacity to achieve in physics by being given the opportunities for education up to the highest levels. And yet, when he completed his doctorate, he found no employment opportunities appropriate to his level of preparation. Subsequent African American doctorates, at least through the civil-rights years of the 1960s, worked in HBCUs or in government. But until employment opportunities opened more broadly in the 1970s, one could not have reasonably expected a significant influx of African Americans into the study of physics. A feedback loop exists between the opportunities for employment and advancement in a field and the ability to attract and retain people. At least for women in physics, appointments to faculty positions seem to track with the number of women in the overall pool. That is not the case for women in chemistry, at least at the major research universities. Industry has done a better job at offering women with chemistry degrees employment in proportion to their numbers. It will not be easy to change the system of education and career opportunities in physics to one that is fully supportive of diversity. But failing to consider change is unacceptable to the health of the field.
