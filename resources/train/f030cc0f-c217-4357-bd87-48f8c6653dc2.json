These were followed by tests of verbal memory, which were in turn followed by Trail Making Tests, Boston Naming Test, and Mini-Mental State Examination.

However, cognition has only limited cross-sectional association with cerebral amyloid burden [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] , which marks the beginning of preclinical AD according to the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) criteria [12] .\nLongitudinal studies have consistently shown that amyloid levels are associated with greater rates of decline on tests of episodic memory [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] , suggesting that amyloid changes precede episodic memory declines. These findings indicate that despite the fifteen-year period prior to diagnosis for detecting cognitive change, currently used neuropsychological tests fall short of detecting changes in the earliest disease stages where therapeutic intervention is hypothesized to be most promising. Therefore, there is a need to develop cognitive tests and batteries that are more sensitive to changes in early preclinical AD and that correlate better with AD-related neuroimaging measures.\nCognitive measures that are dynamic in preclinical disease can facilitate clinical trials aimed at this early stage, as they can serve as outcome measures that are non-invasive and cheaper to administer than neuroimaging evaluations.\nIn order to develop such cognitive tests or batteries, it is necessary to study the neuroimaging correlates and temporal trajectories of currently used tests to identify earliest changing measures. Various studies have investigated correlations between cognitive measures and early AD-related neuroimaging markers [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . In this work, we focus on characterizing the trajectories of a collection of cognitive markers widely used in studies of aging and AD. The ideal study of preclinical AD markers would follow cognitively normal individuals until they are diagnosed with dementia due to AD, and retrospectively analyze the time courses of the markers of those who developed AD.\nHowever, currently available sample sizes do not allow for cross-validation nor yield adequate statistical power to conduct such a study. To overcome this limitation, several statistical analysis approaches have been developed [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . An important concept in a subset of these approaches is the time-alignment of individuals. Here, we used the Progression Score Model [36, 37] , a multivariate nonlinear mixed effects model, to construct cognitive marker trajectories spanning normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD stages by aligning individuals in time based on the similarity of their marker profiles. The method incorporates longitudinal information in performing this alignment and accounts for inter-individual differences in rate and baseline levels of progression. The main premise of the method is that rather than using age as a proxy for disease progression, we can obtain better disease progression indicators as well as temporal trajectories for the biomarkers by aligning individuals in time based on the similarity of their biomarker profiles. Time alignment of individuals allows us to study the long-term trajectories of cognitive measures despite the availability of only a small number of individuals who have traversed large extents of the cognitive trajectories. We conducted separate analyses on two well-characterized longitudinal studies, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging and the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention, in order to delineate the trajectories of measures of verbal memory, executive function, attention, processing speed, language, and mental state among individuals who are cognitively normal, have MCI, or have dementia due to AD.\nThe main aims of the analyses were to: 1) develop a standardized template of cognitive changes against which individuals can be quantified, 2) present evidence of the validity of the individualized scores obtained using the standardized cognitive template by exploring their associations with clinical diagnosis, 3) identify the order in which detectable changes begin to appear across cognitive tests, and 4) validate this identified ordering using an independent approach at the individual level."}, {"section_title": "2.METHODS", "text": "Statistical methods used in the following analyses were applied separately to two ongoing longitudinal cohort studies of human aging: the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) [38] , initiated in 1958 and conducted by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute on Aging, and the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP) [39] , initiated in 2001 and conducted by the University of Wisconsin Alzheimer's Institute."}, {"section_title": "2.1.Participants", "text": "BLSA participants.

We used the last visit for this analysis since diagnosis was available only at last visit in WRAP.\nTo provide further evidence for the temporal ordering of cognitive marker changes, we used an analysis based on a multi-state Markov model that was independent from the Cog-PS approach. In this analysis, we used the mean values of the cognitive markers within the MCI or CI ([M]CI) group at last visit (listed in Table 1 ) as thresholds for categorizing each cognitive measure at each visit as being normal or abnormal, with the exception of MMSE, where we defined abnormality using the conservative threshold \u2264 25 rather than using the sample mean since there is a strong ceiling effect in our samples. For Trails A and B, abnormality was defined as being equal to or exceeding the threshold, and for all other cognitive measures as being equal to or below the threshold.\nWe considered each pair of cognitive measures, denoted x and y, in separate Markov models. We categorized each visit into one of the following four states: x and y both normal (state 1), only x abnormal (state 2A), only y abnormal (state 2B), x and y both abnormal (state 3). If both x and y were missing, the visit was excluded from analysis. If only one was available, then the state of the visit was censored accordingly (i.e., if only x is available and is normal, then the state is either 1 or 2B). We assumed that individuals need to pass through one of the intermediate states 2A or 2B in order to transition between states 1 and 3. All other transitions, including backward transitions, were included in the model, which is summarized in Figure S2 . We fitted this multi-state Markov model using the msm [59] package in R (version 3.2.1) [60] . We are interested in comparing the transitions out of the first state where both measures are normal.

From this model, we obtained individualized scores, termed Cog-PS, which we validated by demonstrating their association with clinical diagnosis. Our analyses were conducted separately on data from two wellcharacterized longitudinal studies of aging, BLSA and WRAP, and revealed similar results.\nUsing the estimated trajectories, we showed that digit span tests exhibit their most extensive dynamic range while individuals are cognitively normal, and that these changes precede those observed on verbal memory tests, which in turn precede changes on Trails, Boston naming, and MMSE. The trajectory estimates we obtained using the progression score model along with their approximate confidence intervals as illustrated in Figure 2 demonstrated this temporal ordering of the cognitive measures. We also used an approach based on a threshold for each cognitive measure to quantify and complement the findings of the qualitative assessment.\nOur findings about ordering of cognitive changes were validated using a multistate However, it should be noted that this is a partial validation since there is a degree of circularity due to the fact that four out of the eight cognitive measures were used in diagnosis determination in BLSA, and eight were used in WRAP.\nWhile we used a calibration approach to render the progression scores computed on BLSA and WRAP comparable, it is important to note that due to differences in the composition of cognitively normal groups in the two data sets, Cog-PS values do not convey the same meaning across the studies. Despite this limitation of our methodology, we found similar temporal cognitive patterns in both studies. Cognitively normal as well as the [M]CI groups in BLSA had lower cognitive performance on all tests compared to WRAP. Our scaling procedure for establishing correspondences across cognitive markers is sensitive to the range of cognitive measurements present in the study. Since this scaling procedure is intended to identify normal and abnormal cognitive test values, it is important that the data set contain measurements spanning the entire normal-to-abnormal range for each cognitive test. This condition is not fully satisfied in either data set we considered in this work, particularly in WRAP since WRAP participants are about 18 years younger than BLSA participants on average. Therefore, the scaling procedure may be less accurate in WRAP than in BLSA, especially for later-changing measures such as Boston naming and MMSE.\nSeveral previous studies have reported that changes in digit span tests are detectable prior to a clinical diagnosis of cognitive impairment. For example, a study that evaluated nondemented individuals with subjective memory complaints found that those with normal digit span scores (as defined using age-and education-adjusted neuropsychological test scores) at baseline did not exhibit significant declines on verbal memory, visual memory, or executive function after a mean follow-up of 6.6 years, but had significant declines on the sum score of digit span forward and backward [61] . On the other hand, age-, sex-, and education-matched individuals with impaired digit span scores at baseline had significant declines on tests of verbal learning and animal fluency but not on any other cognitive test.\nThese findings are in agreement with our estimated ordering of cognitive trajectories on the path to cognitive impairment, with digit span measures declining first, followed by measures of verbal memory. Another study that investigated changes in cognition prior to autopsy in a sample of individuals who remained cognitively normal found that while longitudinal changes were not significant when assessed separately among individuals with and without AD neuropathology, longitudinal decline in the attention/working memory domain (assessed using digit span forward and backward tests) was greater among those with neuropathology compared to those without [62] . Other domains, including episodic memory, language, and executive function, did not show statistically significant longitudinal differences between the two groups [62] .\nA limitation of our method is that it does not indicate whether the detected cognitive changes are due to AD-related mechanisms, and further studies are needed to delineate normal aging versus disease. Therefore, our results cannot be interpreted as evidence for using digit span to predict individualized diagnoses. Digit span is not a good predictor of concurrent diagnosis; using cognitive measure thresholds based on our Cog-PS model to classify individuals as normal versus [M]CI/AD yields a large number of false positives.\nThis lack of specificity of digit span for dementia has been documented previously [63, 64] . What our results demonstrate is that changes in digit span are most evident early on in cognitively normal stages. Detectability of these changes and their associations with future outcomes at the individual-level, including AD diagnosis in following years or decades, remain to be fully elucidated; however, prior studies have reported that sensitivity to change on digit span is small [65] . Another limitation of our method is that it treats discrete cognitive measures such as digit span as continuous variables, and therefore may introduce bias into the characterization of their longitudinal trajectories.\nDespite these limitations, understanding the association of digit span tests with brain changes can be informative for designing novel cognitive tests or batteries that are more sensitive to changes in preclinical AD and that correlate with functional and structural brain changes over the course of disease.\nSeveral studies of a small number of healthy individuals found that higher performance on digit span backward is associated with activation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) [66] [67] [68] , bilateral inferior parietal lobule, anterior cingulate, left DLPFC, and Broca's area, with a subset of these regions also implicated in relation to digit span forward [67, 68] . DLPFC is one of the amyloid accumulating regions, and therefore it may be possible to demonstrate associations between digit span performance and DLPFC amyloid levels among cognitively normal individuals in studies with large sample sizes.\nAnalyses conducted in parallel in multiple data sets or in combined samples will accelerate efforts to further elucidate the relationships among cognitive measures implicated in preclinical AD. Identifying cognitive measures that are dynamic in preclinical AD can lead to the development of novel cognitive tests that are finely tuned to detecting earliest changes. Such measures will facilitate clinical trials aimed at this early stage by serving as outcome measures that are non-invasive and cheaper to administer than neuroimaging."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "We would like to thank the BLSA and WRAP participants and staff for their efforts and "}, {"section_title": "SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Progression Score Model", "text": "For clarity, vector-valued variables are in bold and matrices are capitalized.
