[{"section_title": "Why do we have to have both CRCTs and ITBS or Stanford 9?", "text": "The CRCT is the criterion-referenced competency test, and the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS) and Stanford 9 are norm-referenced tests. A criterion-referenced test measures how well students have learned a particular curriculum. \"Cut scores\" determine the intervals for the categories of scoring: exceeds the standard (350-450), meets the standard (300-349), and does not meet the standard (below 300). The CRCTs, writing assessments, end-of-course tests and graduation test are criterionreferenced tests. Norm-referenced tests measure how well students perform on questions of general knowledge compared to the national average. Scores are reported in percentiles of 1 to 99. The 50 th percentile is the median and is considered an average score. The 25 th percentile --meaning the student performed better than 25% of the students who took the test and worse than 75% --and below show significant weakness. The CRCT tests how well students have mastered the curriculum established by the State Board of Education. The norm-referenced test compares our students' mastery of general knowledge to other students in the nation."}, {"section_title": "What is the NAEP test?", "text": "The National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) is sometimes referred to as the nation's report card. The test is given in reading, math, science, and social studies. Results are provided only at the state level. Federal law requires states to participate in reading and math assessments in grades four and eight every other year. This is considered a check and balance to the state test results. Next, look at test scores for all the students at the state level."}, {"section_title": "Points to Ponder:", "text": "The percent exceeding the standard should be going up, and the percent not meeting the standard should be going down. This would mean that not only are more students at grade level but also more students are doing high level work.\nIf there is a decrease in the percent meeting the standard, is there an increase in the percent exceeding the standard or not meeting the standard? If there is an increase in the percent of students not meeting the standard, are more students below grade level? Look for changes in the number of students tested. The trend information is more important than comparing one year to another. Remember you are not comparing the same group of students. Has improvement been greater in one subject? Is there a reason? Changes in percentage points is not the same as changes in percents."}, {"section_title": "Exercise:", "text": "The percent of second grade students exceeding the standard in English/Language\nArts has increased by 7 percentage points in the last three years. The percent of students who did not meet the standard, however, was the same in the last three years. Is that a bad sign?\nNot necessarily, but the answer requires further analysis. First, this question compares trend information to a year-over-year comparison. Trend data is more important because we are not comparing the same group of students. Second, look at the number of students tested and how the disaggregated groups performed.\nIs there a difference in the number of students tested each year?\nThe number tested shows that 3718 more students were tested in 2008 than in 2007. Which students did we have more of? Disaggregate the number of additional students tested by looking at the number tested in each subgroup.\nThe number of white students tested increased by 148, so 96% of the additional students were minorities, particularly Black (1785) and Hispanic (918). 41% more were Limited English Proficient, and 98.6% more were Economically Disadvantaged.\nWe had an increasing number of students in the groups with a higher percentage English/Language Arts below grade level. How did the disaggregated groups perform?\nThere was steady improvement over three years in the Black, Hispanic, Not Economically Disadvantaged, and Limited English Proficient students' performance.\nThe fact that the overall percentage not meeting the standard remained the same is probably a positive sign. There were more students in groups that have a higher percentage scoring below grade level, there was improvement in four subgroups, and overall we lost no ground."}, {"section_title": "Now look for achievement gaps.", "text": "This can be done in two ways. Click on a subject under \"Achievement Gap Analysis\" on the Test Scores report to see the scores graphed by student group. This allows you to easily compare the subgroups. You can also determine the achievement gap by disaggregating the test score report. Click on the box labeled \"View Scores by Group\" and select a subgroup. These pages also show the trend in the scores of the subgroups.\nWhich groups of students have the highest proportion performing below grade level? Are some groups doing better than others? Which groups have more students not meeting the standard? Are the differences about the same in every subject?"}, {"section_title": "2.6", "text": "The state analysis is the big picture.

The last part of the puzzle is to see how your school compares to schools with similar demographics. The \"Similar Schools\" report will give you this information. First, select the test for which you want to compare scores. Because of the many different school configurations in Georgia, the search engine must look for all schools that gave a particular test then find the schools with a similar population to yours. The next page seen will list your school (the target school), Georgia, and all the similar schools. The demographics are shown also.\nSchools are listed in the order of their similarity to the selected school. Similarity is based on four factors: 1. Percentage of students eligible for Free and/or Reduced Lunch (FRL) 2. Percentage of students with Limited English Proficiency (LEP) 3. Highest ethnic/race percentage at the selected school 4. Second highest ethnic/race percentage at the selected school The similarity index shows how closely a school compares with the selected school on these four factors, with 1 indicating the most similar schools."}, {"section_title": "Next, click on \"Test Scores Comparisons\" to see the test scores of all the schools.

A lot of information has been gathered, but it has to be summarized to serve its purpose.\nWhat percent of the students exceeded the standard in each subject? What was the change over the previous year? Common issues. When analyzing test data, a few other points commonly come up. SAT scores have become the standard the public uses to rank states and high schools. When states are ranked according to the SAT, Georgia usually ranks in the bottom 5. The participation rate (70%+) is usually brought up as one explanation for the score. Georgia does have a high percentage of students taking the SAT. Yet Massachusetts and Connecticut have more than 10% more students taking the SAT and score more than 69 points higher. Delaware, Virginia and Maryland have about the same participation rate as Georgia, yet score significantly higher. The percentage of students awarded a diploma is also about the same as the percentage of students taking the SAT. Clearly, the participation rate is not the problem. The SAT is designed to measure how well prepared a student is for college. Our SAT scores reflect that too many of our students are not prepared for college. ACT scores are not as widely reported, but Georgia also ranks in the bottom 5 on that test.\nAnother issue that comes up in relation to test scores is mobility or transience -students who move during the school year. Principals can provide the number of students who have transferred in and out of the school. Any effect that has on test scores can only be estimated by comparing the AYP report and test scores on the \"report card.\" Test score reports show the results for all students who took the test no matter how long they were at the school. The Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) report provides a way to balance that. The AYP report includes the scores only of those students who were present for the full academic year (fall student count through the spring testing date). The Reading and English Language Arts score is combined, so it would take some calculations to separate that. Math, however, can be used as a quick gauge of mobility and the effect on test scores. Compare the number of students included in the math AYP score (www.gadoe.org) to the number reported on the test score report for all grades included in AYP. Remember that AYP is calculated by school, system, or state not by grade level. Test scores, however, are reported by grade. A higher number tested than shown on the AYP report is the number of students who arrived after the fall count. If there is a significant difference in the number of students, what is the difference in the score?\nTrend analysis of test scores can be affected by the implementation of a new curriculum and test. Consider the following state data for 2 nd grade."}, {"section_title": "2.12", "text": "There were significant changes in the years highlighted for each subject.

If a school's score increases from 62% to 66% and the standard deviation is 4, the increase is not significant in terms of gain.\nIf a student earns a percentile score of 65%, the student performed equal to or better than 65 percent of the students in the norm group.\nA fourth grade student takes a mathematics test designed for fourth graders and earns a grade equivalent of 6.6. This means that the student's score is about the same as what the typical score of sixth graders would have been if they had taken the fourth grade test in the sixth month of school. It does not mean that the student has mastered the sixth grade curriculum."}, {"section_title": "Raw score", "text": "Is the number of test items answered correctly by the student that is used to convert to various derived scores.
