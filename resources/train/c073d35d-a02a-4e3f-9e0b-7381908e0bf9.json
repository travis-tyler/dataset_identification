[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Introduction: Amyloid-related decline in semantic memory was recently shown to be observable in the preclinical period of Alzheimer's disease. Cognitive composites designed to be sensitive to cognitive change in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (e.g., preclinical Alzheimer's cognitive composite [PACC]) and currently used in secondary prevention trials do not currently integrate measures of semantic processing. Our objective was to determine whether a standard semantic measure (i.e., category fluency [CAT] to animals, fruits, and vegetables) adds independent information above and beyond Ab-related decline captured by the PACC. Methods: Clinically normal older adults from the Harvard Aging Brain Study were identified at baseline as Ab1 (n 5 70) or Ab2 (n 5 209) using Pittsburgh compound B-positron emission tomography imaging and followed annually with neuropsychological testing for 3.87 6 1.09 years. The relationships between PACC, CAT, and variations of the PACC including/excluding CAT were examined using linear mixed models controlling for age, sex, and education. We additionally examined decline on CAT by further grouping Ab1 participants into preclinical stage 1 and stage 2 on the basis of neurodegeneration markers. Results: CAT explained unique variance in amyloid-related decline, with Ab1's continuing to decline relative to Ab2's in CAT even after controlling for overall PACC decline. In addition, removal of CAT from the PACC resulted in a longitudinal Ab1/2 effect size reduction of 20% at 3-year follow-up and 12% at 5-year follow-up. Finally, both stage 1 and stage 2 participants declined on CAT in comparison with stage 0, suggesting CAT declines early within the preclinical trajectory. Conclusion: Addition of CAT to the PACC provides unique information about early cognitive decline not currently captured by the episodic memory, executive function, and global cognition components and may therefore improve detection of early Ab-related cognitive decline."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) has an extended preclinical phase whereby changes in the brain, including accumulation of amyloid b (Ab) plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles, are occurring many years before the clinical diagnosis of AD dementia [1, 2] . Current clinical trials are targeting this preclinical period [3, 4] by recruiting individuals with elevated amyloid with the hope of applying diseasemodifying therapies at a point before widespread pathological brain changes. Development of cognitive composites that can track the earliest cognitive changes associated with underlying AD pathology is vital for assessing the efficacy of these treatments [4] [5] [6] .\nCurrent cognitive composites focus on measures of episodic memory, executive function, and global cognition [7, 8] . For example, the preclinical Alzheimer's cognitive composite (PACC) was developed [7] using data from three observational cohort studies (AIBL, ADNI, and ADCS Prevention Instrument Study) and includes (1) the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [9] , (2) Logical Memory Delayed Story Recall [10] , (3) the Digit-Symbol Substitution Test [11] , and (4) recall from the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) [12] . The PACC was recently shown to capture decline in Ab1 versus Ab2 clinically normal older adults within an independent study sample, The Harvard Aging Brain Study [13] .\nSemantic memory decline, despite serving as a prototypical cognitive feature associated with plaque and tangle pathology [14] , has not yet been included in these composites. This may be in part because semantic memory remains understudied and underutilized compared with episodic memory and is not considered an early cognitive change in the AD trajectory [15] . Interestingly, a measure of semantic memory was the first indicator of cognitive decline 12 years before diagnosis of AD dementia in the large PAQUID cohort [16] . Furthermore, two measures of semantic memory (i.e., category fluency [CAT] and the Boston Naming Test) were recently shown to be among a total of seven test outcomes identified as the most statistically sensitive measures of progression from normal cognition to a clinical stage of AD [17] . In addition, we recently identified decline in semantic fluency among Ab1 clinically normal individuals, even after controlling for phonemic fluency [18] . Thus, recent evidence across multiple research groups has converged to suggest that semantic memory decline is occurring earlier in the AD trajectory than previously suspected [16, [18] [19] [20] .\nGiven this background, our goal was to determine whether inclusion of a standard semantic memory measure added unique amyloid-related cognitive signal not captured by the PACC. We hypothesized that semantic memory would provide relevant information above and beyond the current PACC if the following criteria were met: (1) CAT would explain some portion of amyloid-related decline even when controlling for PACC decline; (2) inclusion of CAT in the PACC would increase the difference in longitudinal decline across Ab groups; and (3) CAT showed evidence of early changes within individuals classified as preclinical stage 1 (positive for amyloidosis but negative for neurodegeneration [ND]) [21] ."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sample characteristics", "text": "Harvard Aging Brain Study participants (n 5 279) were recruited from the community.

Cognitive variables (MMSE, LMDR, DSC, FCSRT96, and CAT) were z-transformed using the baseline sample's mean and standard deviation. The PACC was computed by taking the mean of the z-scores across the four tests as previously described [13] . Linear mixed models (LMM) were used to assess the association between baseline Ab status and change in cognition. In the first model, CAT was the dependent variable. Effects of baseline Ab, age, sex and education, as well as their interactions with time were modeled as covariates. The PACC was added as a time-varying covariate to determine whether Ab was associated with CAT over time after controlling for PACC performance over time. In addition, we included a term for the interaction between time-varying PACC and Ab group, to establish whether Ab group remains significantly associated with change in CAT. The model included a random intercept and slope for each participant.\nWe computed the PACC5 and examined the effect sizes reflecting the Ab group difference in longitudinal cognitive trajectories by dividing the \"LMM b\" by its associated error term for the Ab ! time term. We then serially subtracted one component of the PACC5 individually to determine which cognitive measure resulted in a minimization of the Ab group difference. We computed the percent decrease in effect size from the PACC5 for each iteration of the four-component PACC to assess the contribution of CAT in comparison with other PACC components. We also examined each category from CAT separately and average performance for two categories combined (e.g., animals 1 vegetables).\nAnalyses were completed using (1) the entire follow-up period (using all available data), referred to as the 5-year follow-up period and (2) the short (3-year) follow-up (excluding all follow-up data after 3 years of follow-up). Both samples contained the same 279 participants; however, mean follow-up for the short period was 2.87 years with a minimum of 1 year and maximum of 3 year follow-up. The 5-year follow-up group had a mean follow-up of 3.87 years with a range of 1 to 5 years.\nFinally, we examined longitudinal cognitive changes on the individual components of the PACC by preclinical stages (0, 1, and 2) using LMMs [25] to determine whether CAT, in addition to individual PACC components, was changing in only those who were Ab1/ND1 or whether decline was observable in Ab1/ND2. Decline in stage 1 and stage 2 may represent a cognitive test sensitive earlier within the preclinical period compared with a test not exhibiting signal until both amyloidosis and ND are present (i.e., stage 2). We examined all pairwise contrasts (stage 0 vs. stage 1; stage 0 vs. stage 2; and stage 1 vs. stage 2) and quantified the relative magnitude of decline between groups using an effect size (b estimate/standard error) for each contrast."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "There were no differences in performance between Ab1/2 groups on CAT or any individual PACC components at study outset (Table 1) .

The relatively low correlation between CAT and other PACC components, especially when examined longitudinally, suggests that this metric may provide complementary information regarding Ab-related decline among clinically normal participants (Fig. 1).

Furthermore, the time by Ab group term remained significant despite inclusion of a term for the interaction between time-varying PACC and Ab group highlighting that even after controlling for PACC decline specifically within the Ab1 group, there was a significant effect of Ab group on CAT. Likewise, Ab1's exhibited greater decline over time compared with Ab2's on the PACC (t(1082) 5 24.21, P ,.001) as has been previously reported [13] , and this association remained significant after controlling for CAT. While Ab1's declined on all individual categories (i.e., animals, vegetables, and fruit), the amyloid effect size was between 26% and 40% larger when combining all three trials into CAT (Fig. 3 ) when using 5 years of follow-up. During the shorter follow-up of 3 years, the comparison between individual categories was more complex.

More specifically, we showed that CAT continued to explain some portion of amyloid-related cognitive decline even when controlling for overall PACC performance. Second, we showed that removal of CAT from the PACC resulted in a 20% reduction in amyloid-related decline at 3 years of follow-up and a 12% reduction at 5 years of follow-up. Finally, we showed that CAT is a measure that declines early within the preclinical trajectory, showing decline even among the stage 1 group.\nThese results add to a growing body of work indicating that semantic memory decline is observable in the preclinical stages of AD [18, 32, 33] . These findings also provide new information about the natural history of Ab-related semantic fluency decline. More specifically, the greater effect size drop at 3-versus 5-year follow-up when removing CAT from the PACC suggests that CAT declines are observable early within the preclinical period [13] . Furthermore, our finding that CAT was the only PACC component that differentiated stage 0 versus stage 1 suggests that CAT may be particularly useful in secondary prevention trials targeting individuals at the beginning stages of the preclinical AD trajectory (i.e., stage 1 vs. stage 2/3). However, in addition to this early signal, CAT continues to add information regarding Ab-related cognitive decline over the longer 5-year follow-up period.\nBoth CAT and the FCSRT were the greatest contributors to the PACC regardless of follow-up time. While the FCSRT falls under the umbrella of episodic or associative memory tests, a semantic element is involved. Specifically, the FCSRT is distinct from most list-learning paradigms in that this test includes a semantic cueing component to facilitate learning and recall. As such, the FCSRT may be more reliant on the integrity of semantic networks versus traditional episodic memory measures such as story learning and recall (i.e., Logical Memory). In line with this, the FCSRT showed similar correlation strengths with CAT (baseline r 5 0.48 and longitudinal r 5 0.41) as it did with LMDR (baseline r 5 0.43 and longitudinal r 5 0.53), highlighting that the FCSRT incorporates both semantic processing and memory domains. Importantly, despite similarities across the FCSRT and CAT, each measure was independently related to amyloidosis, highlighting the relevant signal encapsulated in each test.\nOur finding of sequentially larger effect sizes when examining three categories versus individual or two categories indicates that inclusion of more than one category is preferable for maximizing Ab1/2 group differentiation over time. The greater variability in effect sizes between different categories at 3-versus 5-year follow-up implies that use of individual categories (e.g., vegetables rather than animals) may have important implications for (1) whether an Ab effect is observed and (2) the magnitude of the Ab effect, particularly in shorter studies with unimpaired individuals. More specifically, vegetable fluency was nonsignificant (b/SE 5 21.03, P 5 .310), whereas fruit fluency (b/SE 5 23.33, P 5 .001) exhibited a longitudinal Ab effect comparable to that observed in the three-component CAT (b/SE 5 23.30, P 5 .001). Differential Ab effects combined with global differences in performance by category (e.g., participants reliably produce more animals compared with vegetables) suggest they may be measuring different aspects of semantic memory. For example, in a study of primarily MCI participants, vegetable fluency performance corresponded to atrophy in a more diffuse set of cortical regions compared with animal fluency concluding that different categories may be dependent on the cortical integrity of different regions [34] . If only two categories can be used, animals and fruits outperform animals and vegetables.\nWhile we chose CAT as our metric of global semantic decline, there are varying semantic measures, which may also exhibit sensitivity at a preclinical stage, such as measures of confrontation naming. However, on measures such as the Boston Naming Test, performance is often strongly linked with educational level, ceiling effects are present in normal older adults, and cultural specificity limits the production of valid alternate forms in global trials [35] . The lack of ceiling effects and normal distribution of scores produced by CAT are test properties, which facilitate its incorporation into a composite score. A caveat to consider in applying our findings to clinical trial design is the differences in statistical models employed. While our analyses centered on LMMs, future work may be necessary to examine PACC iterations with statistical models used in clinical trials such as mixed effect model of repeat measurement. In addition, our sample is American, English-speaking, and 82% Caucasian, and future work is required to determine the generalizability of the PACC5 to more ethnically, educationally, and culturally diverse communities. Another potential limitation of the current work is the diminishing returns of further optimizing a well-functioning composite. Multiple reports have shown efficacy of the PACC to detection of amyloid-related cognitive decline. These findings persist despite variations on the cohorts employed [13] , measures used [8] , and test weightings adjusted [36] . These converging findings suggest that the use of a cognitive composite that incorporates multiple domains is effective in detecting amyloid-related cognitive decline within the preclinical period. However, our finding that semantic memory provides unique information about amyloid-related cognitive decline not currently captured in measures of memory, executive functions, and global cognition suggests that future prevention trial designs should consider including category generation in their cognitive composites.
