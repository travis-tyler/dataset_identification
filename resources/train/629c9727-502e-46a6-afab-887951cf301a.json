The purpose of this research is to create a better understanding of the coastal environment of the United States; more specifically the social and physical landscapes of Atlantic coast barrier beaches in an attempt to move towards a science of U.S. coastal land cover change science. To understand resource management issues in the region it is important to understand history of land change that has occurred and to understand the spatial and temporal patterns and processes of land use and cover change. This is important because human land behaviors on the coast have important effects on both natural and cultural resources, terrestrial and marine environments, and regional sense of place. Explicitly coastal-themed research is needed to understand the patterns and drivers of coastal landscape change in ways that integrate the biophysical and social science domains. This research aims to integrate in this manner and will also examine the important role of role of policy as driving force impacting trajectory of land cover change focusing particularly on change from \"undeveloped\" to \"developed\" status. My dissertation is comprised of three main parts that examine different aspects of Atlantic barrier beach land change and coastal development. Each part will form the basis of a dissertation chapter and a stand-alone peer-reviewed manuscript submission. While the dissertation operates in a \"three article\" mode, the three chapters along with introductory and concluding chapters will also form a coherent whole analysis that represents the first Goal 3: Using results from prior goals to guide site selection perform a localized, place-based analysis of land change using quantitative and qualitative data, historical and newspaper data, and policy history for two or three selected units in order to construct narratives that account for the spatially and temporally contingent process of barrier beach place creation. The dissertation is organized as follows: chapter 2 provides an overview of barrier beaches as well as a literature review of land change science and coastal policy that informs and supports research objectives stated at the end of the chapter. Chapters 3, 4, and 5 describe elements of the proposed goals stated above dealing with Goal 1's descriptive analysis, Goal 2's statistical modeling, and Goal 3's place-based analysis."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 2: Importance and State of U.S. Barrier Beaches", "text": "The coast of the United States, like many other countries around the world, has a long history of human development pressure, especially on barrier beaches (Walker 1990). Barrier beaches are elongated bodies of sand bounded on either end by inlets that allow salt and fresh water to flow into and out of the estuary behind the system (Pilkey et al. 1998). These beaches comprise 13-15 percent of the world's coastline and approximately 4,350 km of the U.S. coastline from Maine to Texas (USDOI 1982), it is the \"longest and best evolved chain of barrier beaches in the world\" (Leatherman and Godfrey 1979 p.57). They provide the first line of defense to the mainland and adjacent wetlands, estuaries, inlets and near shore waters from the direct impact of wind waves and streams. Barrier beaches are also dynamic geomorphic features changing constantly by the actions of wind, waves, currents, and tides. Storms, including nor'easters and hurricanes, often impact the U.S. Atlantic Coast, which can cause drastic changes on barrier beaches through erosion, and even creation of inlets. Their low-lying topography makes them vulnerable to storm-surge flooding; many barrier beaches are only a few meters above sea level (Leatherman 1988). Barrier beaches and surrounding coastal region represents some of the highest anthropogenic development and human populations in the world (Weinstein et al. 2007). These beaches are some of the most valuable in terms of real estate, yet they are one of the most, if not the most, vulnerable ecosystems in the world (U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy 2004;Perez-Maqueo et. al. 2007). The affinity for the coastal setting from beaches to ocean views has drawn multitudes of people to barrier beaches taking vacations and even building homes (Zhang and Leatherman 2011). From 1945 to 1973 barrier beaches urbanized at a rate of 153 percent, which at the time was three to four times faster than the mainland (Dolan et al. 1973). In 1975 urban use in the entire U.S. was three percent while on the 282 barrier beaches urban use was more than four times greater, 14 percent (Stiffin 1981). Zhang and Leatherman (2011) found that according to 2000 census there are roughly 1.4 million people living on barrier beaches with an average population increase for census years 1990 to 2000 of 14 percent. Population densities of barrier beaches compared to coastal states are on average three times greater (Zhang and Leatherman 2011)."}, {"section_title": "The Importance of Barrier Beaches", "text": "Barrier beaches provide the first line of defense to the mainland and adjacent wetlands, estuaries, inlets and near shore waters from the direct impact of wind waves and streams. Barrier beaches have been found to be most common in coastal settings that have the a gentle sloping continental shelf bordering a low-relief coastal plain, an abundant supply of sediment, and moderate to low tidal ranges (Glaeser 1978). A prime example of a coastline with these characteristics is found along the U.S. Atlantic coast. Davis (1994) goes on to state that the barrier beaches are sandy beaches developed from a broadened barrier beach that is above high tide and parallel to the shore and extending from the beach it has dunes, vegetated zones and swampy terrains. Schwartz (1971) found that factors such as the sediment source, the sediment type and supply, the rate and direction of relative sea-level changes, the basin shape, the slope of the continental shelf, the direction and strength of currents and waves, and the magnitude of tides all affect barrier beach development. Barrier beaches development can be explained by one of three major theories: offshore bar theory, spit accretion theory and submergence theory ( Figure   2-1). Davis et al. (2004) stated that barriers can form by a number of different mechanisms and no single theory can explain the development of all barrier beaches. Offshore barrier theory was originally proposed by De Beaumont (1845) and supported by Johnson (1919) in which he believed waves moving into shallow water churned up sand, which was deposited in the form of a submarine bar when the waves broke and lost much of their energy. As the bars accreted vertically, they gradually built above sea level, forming barrier beaches. Spit accretion theory proposed by Gilbert in 1885 suggests that material for the bar is transported along the shore rather than coming from erosion of the sea floor. Submergence theory McGee (1890) described beach formation by the detachment of mainland beaches during sea-level rise. Barrier beaches are formed primarily of sand and generally include features such as a sandy beach, dunes (both primary and secondary), maritime forest, wetlands, and a backshore comprised mainly of marsh (Figure 2-2). Lagoons or sounds generally separate the barrier beach from the mainland. Beaches on barrier beaches are the areas where sediment transfer takes place as well as the initial disruption of wave energy. Dunes are vital yet extremely vulnerable component of the barrier beach because primary dunes act as buffers to salt spray. Dune creation and vegetation allows for stabilization of the barrier beach because many species of plant can exist in the mid barrier region along the barrier flats as well as the maritime forest at the back of the barrier beach. Barrier beaches are very dynamic geomorphic features and change constantly by the actions of wind, waves, currents, and tides. Storms, including nor'easters and hurricanes, often impact the U.S. Atlantic Coast during the winter and summer, causing drastic changes of barrier beaches through erosion and inlet breaching. Barrier beaches have an extremely dynamic nature whereby major changes in geomorphology and hydrology can occur over days, or even hours, in response to extreme episodic storm events (EESEs) such as tropical cyclones, hurricanes, and northeasters (Feagin et al. 2010). Barrier beach width, dune elevation, tidal prism, wave energy, and storm surge energy influence the likelihood of overwash (Leatherman et al. 1977;Claudino-Sales et al. 2008), transport of sediment offshore, and formation of new inlets during storms (Fitzgerald and Van Heteren 1999)."}, {"section_title": "Towards a Science of U.S. Coastal Land Change", "text": "The science of U.S. coastal land change is an area that has been explored, but there has yet to be a uniform understanding and exploration of the human and land use change process that occur within this spectrum (Klemas et al. 1993;Ramsey et al. 2001;Corssett et al. 2004;Ellis et al. 2011). These areas range from coastal development (Dolan et al. 1973;Stiffin 1981;Crawford 2007), coastal population (Bartlet et al. 2000;Zhang andLeatherman 2011), coastal hazards (Cutter et al. 2000;Boruff et al. 2005), and coastal land cover (Forman 2009). This research will attempt to take into context the concepts of land change science and move towards an understanding of land change within the coastal U.S. through creation of barrier beach data base as well as a localized place based analysis of landscape change over time. Land change science (also known as, land systems science or Land Use/Cover Change (LUCC)), is an interdisciplinary field of study, which seeks to comprehend, explain, and project land use and land-cover change (Turner 2002;Turner et al. 2007). Thirty to fifty percent of the land has been transformed by anthropogenic inputs on the surface (Vitousek et al. 1997), cultivation on the land has taken up an area nearly the size of South America (Raven 2002). No land can be considered unspoiled due to the fact that human induced climate change and pollution has impacted all landscapes (Meyer and Turner, 1994). Land change science has emerged as a cornerstone of global environmental change and attempts to understand the human and biophysical factors influencing land cover dynamics defined as the temporal variations in land cover and land use (Rindfuss et al. 2004). Within the context of coastal land change science major milestones reflect not only coastal specific advances in understanding, but overall land change science advances, (Figure 2-3). The most notable milestone for U.S. coastal land Change is the creation of the Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) in 1992. C-CAP created a nationally standardized database to observe land cover change for the coastal area of the United States (Thomas and Ferguson 1990;Thomas et al. 1991). The National Land Cover Database was created in 1993 as a multiagency attempt to map land cover for the entire United States as well as monitor land cover change."}, {"section_title": "Themes and Perspectives of Land Change Science", "text": "The key themes for land change science include identifying patterns of land cover change, processes of land use change, human responses to Land use/cover change, integrated global and regional models and development of databases on land surface, biophysical processes, and their socioeconomic and biophysical drivers (IGBP 1999) ( Figure 2-4). Land change science modeling has been largely focused on topics such as tropical deforestation (Lambin 1994;Kaimowitz and Angelsen 1998), economic models of land use (Irwin and Geohegan 2001;Plantinga 1999), land change science dynamics (Veldkamp and Lambin 2001;Agarwal, et al. 2002;Verburg et al. 2004), and ecological landscapes (Baker 1989;. Land change science modeling requires a mixture of approaches, which include the narrative, the agent based, and the systems approach perspectives (Lambin et.al. 2003). The narrative perspective, essentially a case study, looks for understanding through historical detail and analysis. It tells the land change science story through providing an empirical and interpretative history. Through this narrative history the validity and accuracy of the other visions can be tested as well as projected over time. Narrative is most beneficial when it comes to identifying chance events that considerably impact land-use/cover change, but are overlooked by approaches implementing temporal and spatially insufficient methods. Agent based as well as the systems approach are dependent on explicit model development and empirical testing (Briassoulis 2000). The agent based model of land-use/land-cover change consists of the cellular model representing the landscape and the agent based model representing human interaction and decisions. In the agent based model rules define the relationship between agents and their environment, and rules that determine sequencing of actions in the model (LUCC 2001). The systems perspective, in contrast, finds agents are constrained by the rules that society establishes creating in turn opportunities and constraints on decision making (Ostrom 1990). Systems perspective operates interactively at different spatial and temporal scales with the ability to link local conditions to global processes (Moran et al. 1998)."}, {"section_title": "Driving Forces", "text": "In land cover change science there is an understanding that underlying forces are changing the landscape. These forces (i.e. population change, erosion, housing density change) that that cause observed landscape changes, i.e. they influence the trajectories of landscape development are called driving forces (B\u00fcrgi et al. 2004). These forces have been described as keystone processes (Marcucci 2000), drivers (Wood and Handley 2001) or causal or causative factors (Geist et al. 2006). Driving forces of landscape change has long history within the discipline of geography (Wirth 1969;Wood and Handley 2001) and has been recognition that land use/cover change is one of the key factors affecting global environmental change (Dale et al. 1993;Meyer and Turner 1994). Driving forces recognize that society and the environment are interconnected in space and time and the cultural landscape reflects changes in these interconnections (Russell 1997). The importance of understating the interconnections of society and nature that make looking at the forces driving landscape change significant (B\u00fcrgi and Russell 2001). Many studies highlight the role of policies in driving land-use changes (Lambin et al. 2001), but it is due to a lack of spatially explicit data (socioeconomic and biophysical) and difficulties in methodology that make linking social and biophysical data difficult to operationalize in ways leading to direct linkages of policy to land change outcomes (Veldkamp and Lambin 2001). Political factors can be expressed spatially as social construct with implied boundaries over territory. They can also be measured in terms of efficiently and spatial area that it can span by observing change over time. More work examines the roles of population growth (i.e. population increase and migration) on land cover change. I=PAT is an important theoretical development involving population that seeks to explain land use/cover change. I=PAT defines land use/cover change as the product of total population (P); affluence (A); and all other human activities (T), or technology (Holdren and Ehrlich 1974). Over large temporal and spatial resolutions I=PAT explains change, however at lower spatial and temporal scales it overlooks many economic and biophysical factors impacting the landscape (Lambin et al. 2003). Driving forces can best be explained by a combination of factors, which are identified through a greater understanding of existing institutions, economy and culture explicate to the area being analyzed (Agarwal and Yadama 1997;Barbier and Burgess 2001;Lambin et al. 2001). Nagendra et al. (2004) found that through the use of a variety of driving forces interact dynamically to give rise to different scenarios and trajectories of change, based on the environmental, social, political and historical extent. To better understand dynamics and nature of changes in the coupled human-environment system social, economic, and political driver data can be used along with the land cover data to link drivers through exploratory analysis and regression approaches (Marsik et al. 2011). Exploratory and regression analysis methods are selected techniques from a wider set of methods used in the land change science community. These two general method types are reviewed below because they are the proposed methods to accomplish two of my research goals."}, {"section_title": "Regression Analysis", "text": "Regression analysis is used to investigate the association of a dependent variable with one or more independent variables. Regression techniques used in land change science include, but are not limited to linear regression, logistic regression, and multinomial regression. Linear regression is a method that estimates the coefficients of a linear equation, involving one or more independent variables, which best predict the value of the dependent variable. Logistic regression is used in situations where the dependent variable has binary outputs, which there are only two possible values for each digit. The method is useful to predict the probability that a case will be classified into one as opposed to the other of the two categories of the dependent variable. Multinomial regression models are used for the case of a dependent variable with more than two categories (Jobson 1992). This type of regression is similar to logistic regression, but it is more general because the dependent variable is not restricted to two categories. (1968 -1982) The history of U.S. coastal policy has evolved over time stemming from general policies, such as the National Flood Insurance Program and OBRA to policies specific to the coastal region such as CZMA Barrier Island Bill and the CBRA. U.S. coastal policy can best be understood as a unique process in which competing policy coalitions work together, though not always in agreement to produce a patchwork of policies, plans, programs, and actions that affect the conservation and development of coastal areas and resources (Godschalk 1992). This grouping of policies, plans, programs, and actions are highlighted in Figure 2-5 showing the major policies at the federal level that have directly influenced coastal land use from 1968 through 2005."}, {"section_title": "Federal Coastal Policy", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)", "text": "The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (NFIA) was motivated by a long history of property damage and loss of life due to flooding.

Specifically, it sought to unite development of nearshore coastal policy with state fishery management efforts. The bill aimed at creating an effective state-federal and local-federal relationship that would be promoted through coastal zone management programs (Hochberg 1981). The bill would work with the coastal zone management energy impact program, which grants and loans for mitigating the impact of offenergy development. The most important part of the Barrier Island Bill is that it supported the acquisition of undeveloped barrier beaches, which included many high hazard floodplain areas and estuarine sanctuaries. Under the barrier island acquisition bill undeveloped beaches would be overseen by the National Park Service (Hochberg 1981)."}, {"section_title": "Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA)", "text": "In an attempt to cut back on government spending Congress passed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (OBRA). OBRA contained a provision, Section 342, \"that will halt the availability of flood insurance for new development or major improvement of structures located on designated undeveloped barrier beaches starting on October 1, 1983\" (Gordon 1984). The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) was identified by Congress as a source of significant federal expenditure. In a report from Congress the monetary liability of the NFIP was second to the Social Security Program in government spending (Kuehn 1981). The OBRA cut spending on vulnerable barrier beaches and concentrated funds towards more appropriate areas."}, {"section_title": "Coastal Barrier Resources Act of 1982", "text": "In 1982, the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA) was signed into law, establishing a policy that protected coastal barrier in defined geographic locations along with their waterways inlets and wetlands through restricting Federal expenditures, which encourage development of these coastal barriers. An undeveloped coastal barrier, defined by the CBRA, is any landform composed of unconsolidated shifting sand or other sedimentary material which is generally long and narrow and entirely or almost entirely surrounded by water. These barriers are above normal tides and usually have terrestrial vegetation and dunes. These barriers were also fairly undeveloped with a density of less than on building per five acres and devout of infrastructure including roads, water, electricity, and wastewater removal. Another feature of these barriers is that they enclose and in so doing protect other features, such as estuaries, salt marshes, and the In these defined locations no new Federal expenditures or financial assistance are allowed, with the exception of specific exempted projects (mainly dredging for navigational purposes).The overall intention of the act was to reduce the loss of human life, wasteful The act also created digital maps for the remainder of the CBRS. Godschalk (1984) found that the CBRA had slowed the development rate on certain undeveloped barrier beaches. He based his study on the institutional framework that in response to the CBRA actors had directions to respond eventually giving the final impact ( Figure 2-6). The three main forms of information gathering methods were used included case studies of two coastal barriers, a mail survey of coastal government officials, developers and conservationists in three states, and finally mail, telephone and personal inquiries among insurance, financial, and related government agencies. In the case studies it was found that there was initial confusion by developers coupled by increased state legislation that heavily impacted the development trajectories of the two case studies. The mail survey as well as telephone and personal inquiries concluded that it was too early to give definitive answers about the impact of CBRA. While some barrier beaches' development slowed as a result of CBRA the study found that ultimately the overall impact of the CBRA would depend largely on the responses of stakeholders in the coastal barrier Beaches as well as future federal actions. While the CBRA was seen as a success, Jones (1991) found that there were other forces acting upon the system that allowed development to occur. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) (1992) (Wiley et al. 2007). When looking at local coastal policy it is the interest of the local stakeholders that plays a pivotal role in shaping the policies within an area. This is where the strict enforcement of specific policies occurs and it is based on this preference of policy that some are enforced more than others."}, {"section_title": "Objectives", "text": "The overall objective of this research is to characterize the patterns and drivers of land use/cover change on barrier beaches along with examining the role that development, spatial accessibility and policy have in determining land use/cover change. This will ultimately help in the contribution to knowledge of U.S. coastal land change science. The research will also describe and classify barrier beaches into a descriptive typology. In creating the barrier beach typology it will include data ranging from land cover, social attributes, anthropogenic inputs, as well as coastal hazard elements. Along with creating a barrier beach typology the research will seek to assess the relative strengths and drivers of development using statistical regression techniques. Through review of literature specific coastal drivers will be identified and measured to determine the degree to which the chosen factors affect the trajectory of developed land cover on barrier beaches. Finally, the research will seek to understand the influences and forces that cause outliers through detailed case studies of identified units. Through the use of attributed spatial data as well as historic documentation the research will seek to understand changes in barrier beaches at high spatial and temporal scale. \u2022 Produce a thematic GIS data layer containing the population Atlantic barrier beaches. \u2022 Develop a database characterizing biophysical, socio-economic, and policy attributes of \u2022 Develop theoretically informed expectations of factors that influence land conversion to developed use status for Atlantic barrier beaches. \u2022 Apply statistical regression analysis to test hypothesizes regarding drivers of coastal land change. Goal 3: Using results from prior goals to guide selection perform a localized, place-based analysis of land change using quantitative and qualitative data, historical and newspaper data, and policy history for two or three selected beaches in order to construct narratives that account for the spatially and temporally contingent process of barrier beach places. \u2022 Select a set of barrier beaches whose observed land change trajectory is substantially different from that predicted from the quantitative predictive model in order to explore more nuanced, localized, and place-based model of coastal land change. \u2022 Assemble a qualitative database for targeted beaches to include historical documentation, newspaper articles, and policy information. \u2022 Create a theoretically informed, narrative analysis of barrier beach land change.   Adopting a place-based approach provides a context in which problems to be addressed by coastal managers and planners can be identified and expressed, which different ideals can be understood (Potschin and Haines-Young 2012). An exploration and understanding of place, has been acknowledged as one way in linking the connections between people and the environment (Wilson and Bryant 1997;Bryant and Wilson 1998;Lackey 1998;Stringer et al. 2006;and Reed 2008). Albrechts (2006aAlbrechts ( , 2006bAlbrechts ( , 2010  economic indicators, and land use with geomorphic, biotic, and hydrological characteristics as input to cluster analysis that yields a set of \"homogenous environmental management units\". With the use of GIS, applied geodemographic classification involving cluster analysis techniques applied to spatial data has become a common approach to disentangle the complexities of multivariate datasets into more parsimonious regional typologies (Debenham et al. 2003;Singleton and Longley 2009). This place-based approach to classifying coastal regions is best exemplified in Tym and Partners (2011). Coastal typologies of coastal 10,057 community units along the entire coast of  (Godschalk 1984). A secondary goal of this analysis is therefore to compare the resulting place-based classification typology with CBRA status to determine if places in resulting place types experience higher rates of growth associated with CBRA status. The expectation is that the influence of CBRA status will act to dampen growth rates. To summarize objectives: First, I perform a quantitative descriptive analysis of the Atlantic barrier coast region to yield an integrative coastal place typology classification that incorporates both socio-economic and land cover data. Second, I evaluate the patterns and linkages amongst CBRA units and non-CBRA units with respect to the coastal barrier beach typology.\nThe central thesis of this chapter is that local scale histories, spatial contexts, environments, and policies contribute to differentiated trajectories on these barrier beaches. The main objective of this paper is to develop and implement a coastal restructuring framework that enables description, interpretation, and comparison of the historical trajectory of human land use development for any barrier beach community. The secondary objective is to apply the created model to two selected barrier beach units that exhibit contrasting characteristics. The research follows similar framework set forth by Light andDineen (1994), McCally (1999), and Solecki et al. (1999) which outlines the periodic nature of infrastructure and land use development in South Florida. This research will look at the societal influences inside the chosen locations without taking into account external forces that may exist at alternate scales. The research will address the issues of social history of interaction between people and place. It will chart the path of landscape conversion over time through quantitative and qualitative methods. Through the use of this data, the study will create an understanding of land change history that is reflective of localized events. The research will also address the role social history plays in the trajectory of land change of place. Landscape change is illustrated through creating a narrative that utilizes the historical parcel data, policy and historical documentation (Walker and Solecki 2004). This generates a perspective beyond data outputs of the key components that evaluate localized land change. It allows for an understanding of the interconnection between the region's social structure and environment, which creates a conversation of land cover change (Swyngedouw 1999). This discourse represents landscapes as a holistic manifestation of coupled human and natural elements; it follows that cultural processes can lead either to physical change or to change in the cultural system itself (Marcucci 2000). The linkages and relationship of these components has the propensity to fill the voids in understanding and evaluating the processes of LUCC of an individual unit as well as the application for all barrier beach units. The wider breath of this research can be applied to issues of coastal management, most notably issues pertaining to social interaction on the landscape. Understanding the past trajectories and patterns that occur on the landscape can help lead to greater understanding of the dynamics that exist within an area. This is especially important in understanding how to plan and manage landscapes based on past and present uses. The trajectories also have the potential to identify conflicting uses that exist within an area. Understating the current condition provides planners and managers a vision of the social landscape for that area. Based on the current condition they can assess if they need to shift the current use or maintain the existing use. An example of this is if a tourist landscape wants to shift to a conservation landscape they would want to move that use to a managed amity. This would allow them to keep their tourism industry as well as protect their valuable natural resources that are impeded upon by tourism."}, {"section_title": "Study Area", "text": "The study area encompasses the Atlantic coast seaboard spanning nine states and 2,000 km from Long Island, New York to Miami Florida (Figure 3-1 period with a more current end date. However, data availability limited the analysis to this period because required census data at the block or block group level for 2010 were not available at the time of analysis. Similarly, the most recent available land cover data temporally consistent with available census data were from 2001. Despite these temporal limitations, using these best available data enables one to characterize fairly recent patterns and dynamics across the entirety of the Atlantic barrier coast. The methodological process describe more fully below included: (1) creating a GIS layer defining barrier beach spatial units (i.e. coastal barrier beach places), characterizing land use/cover change, socio-economic patterns and change and CBRA status, performing cluster analysis to create a place-based coastal barrier beach typology, and 4comparing results of the classification results with the CBRA policy status.\nThe study area for this research encompasses barrier beaches along the Atlantic coast stretching approximately 2,000 km and nine states from Long Island, New York to Miami, Florida (Figure 4-2). Barrier beaches were identified through the use of ArcGIS Bing Maps imagery with varied dates ranging from 1993 to 2010. A total of 155 barrier beaches were digitized as vector GIS polygons to conform to land/ocean interface boundaries visually evident in the Bing Maps imagery at a constant viewing scale of 1:20,000. Barrier beaches as they pertain to this study are classified as barrier islands, spits, bay barriers, or any piece of land directly in contact with the Atlantic Ocean. Other coastal landform types present in other parts of the U.S. (i.e. rocky shores, marine terraces, etc.) were excluded in order to focus solely on coastal barrier environments. The digitized vector polygon data were then combined with a U.S. \nResults from related work reported in Chapter 3 typology found there to be three main types Units with varying degrees of characteristics were needed for this study to validate that the model could be applied across an array/variety of barrier beach unit. Units with contrasting development, social, and physical characteristics were selected based on data from Chapter 3 and 2000 census calculations (Table 5-1). The ideal units selected would be one unit whose characteristics are greater than the average for all barrier beach units and one unit whose characteristics are lower than the average. Additional factors would include differences in location, because if two units with proximate locations were measured there would be similar forces acting upon the landscapes. Along with location differences, uses of the typological classification in Chapter 3 were included in the criteria. Different classification typologies allow for landscapes with different types of use to be examined. These differences ultimately show the utility and versatility of the method. The first unit selected for the study was Long Beach, NY, which represents an Old Atlantic community where development has not been regulated by federal coastal policy ( Figure 5-3). Long Beach is located on the southern shore of Long Island in Nassau County New York. It is known for its surfing community that has been attracted by jetties placed along the shore creating the ideal surfing atmosphere. The area also has a large accessibility to population being less than fifty kilometers from New York City. The unit has approximately 11.6 km of oceanfront coastline with a total land area of 1128.36 ha. The population of the area in 2000 was 43,556 and the total housing units were 19,885 with 5.6% being seasonal housing. The second unit for this study is Currituck Banks, NC which is a New Atlantic community with development that has been influenced by federal and state coastal policy. Currituck Banks is located on the far northern end of North Carolina on the border of Virginia. The unit has approximately 10.8 km of oceanfront coastline with a total land area of 1928.78 ha. The unit is divided into two parts by the Currituck National Wildlife Refuge, which runs from shore to sound. The area is also known for its lack of access by paved roads and wild ponies that roam the landscape. The area is sparsely populated with only 134 permanent residents according to the 2000 census.

All measures of this data were performed at different processes to calculate the best available calculations for each barrier beach unit. This process attempts to create constancy with calculations. Barrier beaches present a challenge when analyzing areal units due to the mobility of these places to shift and move over time as well as the procedures to analyze the data. When looking at this data the dilemma of the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) noted by Openshaw (1984) must be taken into account. MAUP stresses that the areal units, which are used geographical studies are subjective, changeable, and subject to whoever is doing, or did, the data collection."}, {"section_title": "Barrier Beach Unit Identification", "text": "Barrier beach units are treated as individual \"places\" and were identified using methods adapted from Zhang and Leatherman (2011) using Bing Maps imagery (Figure 3-2) and GIS spatial data editing. The dates for the Bing Maps varied, ranging from 1993 to 2010 in concert with other GIS data products. Barrier beach landforms were digitized as vector GIS polygons to conform to land/ocean interface boundaries visually evident in the Bing Maps imagery at a constant viewing scale of 1:20,000. This initial boundary layer was then combined with the U.S. that are prevalent throughout much of the study area. For these mainland cemented units, only the 1990 census tract land areas adjacent to the ocean were included. A small number of other isolated cases were treated in an identical manner. In no cases did CBRA or OPA units span state boundaries. Non-CBRA units that crossed state boundaries were split to create two separate non-CBRA units. Some non-CBRA units were not spatially contiguous due to perforation by OPA or CBRA units so that they contained two or more distinct parts. Spatially disconnected parts no more than two miles in distance from one another on the same barrier beach landform were defined into a single common barrier beach unit. Finally, military installations were removed from the study due to their unique characteristics related to national defense. In total, 188 barrier beach units were identified. Off these units, 49 were CBRA, 58 were OPA, and 81 were non-CBRA (Table 3-1). The barrier beach units are treated as distinct coastal places where a place may be, for example, a settled coastal community not subject to CBRA (i.e. Asbury Park, NJ), a coastal community subject to CBRA (i.e. Currituck Banks, NC) or an OPA protected area (i.e. Cape Hatteras National Seashore)."}, {"section_title": "Land Cover Data", "text": "Land cover data were obtained from the Multi-Resolution Land Consortium (MRLC), a group of 11 federal agencies that coordinates and generates geospatial land cover products for the United States (Homer et al. 2007). The National Land Cover Database (NLCD) land cover classification provided by the MRLC is based on Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite imagery (NOAA 1995) and has a pixel resolution of 30 meters. The NLCD uses image processing and classification techniques to provide land use/cover and change information at the Anderson Level II classification scale (Anderson et al. 1976). The NLCD products were used to quantify for each barrier beach unit ( wetlands, and park land area from total land area (Figure 3-3). The logic is that development would be unlikely to occur for these land cover categories. Note that some pixels in the NLCD products contained small counts of water pixels (i.e. interior ponds, canals, etc.). Importantly, subtracting in this manner allows for a measure of the amount of land available for development as well as actual amounts of development and development change."}, {"section_title": "Socio-economic Data", "text": "Population and economic characteristics for each unit were assembled from 1990 and 2000 census data (Table 3-2). Various GIS overlay and aggregation methods using census blocks and block groups were necessary to derive the variables due to the fact that census units in many cases did not perfectly align the self-generated barrier beach unit boundaries. Count data (i.e. population, housing) were computed by selecting block centroids falling within the boundaries of identified barrier beach units and summing the associated values which were assigned to the appropriate respective units, (Figure 3-4). Population and housing unit density were calculated by dividing these respective counts by the amount of land area available for development. Percents of population by age categories were calculated by dividing these respective counts by total population. To determine median housing value and income, census block group data from 1990 and 2000 were used as higher resolution census block data do not contain these attributes due to confidentiality issues related to data release. Due to the larger size of block groups compare to blocks, the centroid method was not used, and instead the block group data were transformed into a 30 meter raster with each pixel being assigned the value of the block group within which it was located. For example, pixels were assigned median income values for their respective block groups. Zonal statistics were used to calculate the mean of all pixels in a barrier beach unit to yield the final variable. For example, a unit may have pixels located in three different block groups thereby having three different median income values represented by these pixels. Summing all pixel values and dividing by the total count of pixels yields an estimate, in this example, of median income for the barrier beach unit. This method is similar to vector areal interpolation but differs by operating in a raster environment.

The temporal logic for use of these variables is that it accounts for characteristics at the 1990 start date coupled with change over the 1990-2000 periods. Eight variables represented characteristics at the initial analysis technique was used to generate the place-based typology. In the clustering process, K-Means separates observations into distinct, relatively homogenous groups having the minimum within-cluster variation and the maximum between-cluster variation K-Means also requires numeric interval or ratio scaled variables with equal scale units (Bacher et al. 2004). The variables included in the typology are based on different scale units (i.e. some are counts and some are percentages). All variables were therefore standardized prior to analysis using SPSS statistical software. Within K-Means the value of k, or the total number of clusters, is not prescribed rather it is chosen by the user. To generate an appropriate value for k a hierarchical approach is taken; in this case Wards Linkage is used. It has been found that when combining both hierarchal approaches along with K-Means results better cluster creation (Chen et al. 2005, Li et al. 2007). The first part of process is all variables are placed into a Principle Components Analysis (PCA). The PCA converts the variables into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables otherwise known as principle components (PC). Of the sixteen variables placed into the PCA 7 PCs were created whose cumulative variance of 83.6% (Table 3- The second step in determining k is placing the seven generated PCs from the PCA into a Ward's Method. This method is used in succession with K-Means to create aggregate the appropriate number for k. This is done through finding the stage where the greatest variance between coefficients exists in the Wards Methods, otherwise referred to as the elbow (Figure 3 -5). Then the total number of stages is subtracted by the elbow, which determines the appropriate number of cluster for K-Means analysis (Thorndike 1953). Results revealed six clusters to be optimal as indicated by the number of stages subtracted by the elbow location (114 stages minus elbow at stage 108 = 6)."}, {"section_title": "K-Means Results", "text": "K-Means cluster analysis results yielded 6 clusters containing 2, 2, 6, 21, 37, and 46 barrier beach units respectively.

Small clusters (n=2) were not reported on because they were a third of the smallest cluster making them less meaningful compared to larger clusters. They also were identified as CBRA barrier beach units meaning that a degree of variability was created based on policy interaction that would be hard to explain in clusters. The mean, median, and standard deviation values were calculated to assess the general characteristics of each cluster (Table 3- "}, {"section_title": "Atlantic Coast Barrier Beach Communities", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Old Atlantic Communities", "text": "The results from the K-Means cluster analysis show that Old Atlantic Communities embody highly developed and established communities. During the study period, slow to no growth in population density as well as housing density portray these places as exhausted in terms of new development (i.e. built out) and population. While these places are highly developed and slow growing over the study period, they also exhibit larger working age populations as well as lower median incomes and median housing values. These units range from developed urbanized coasts to highly developed beach cottage communities. These places over the observed period exhibit the characteristics of places slowed by the availability of land as well as the existing population and housing pressures existent at the beginning of the study period. Beach Cottage communities represent the largest clustering of units (n=46), these units exhibit slow growth in developed density over the observed period. These areas can be seen as barrier beach communities that have slower paced change yet have been developed over a longer period of time then observed in this study. Communities such as Wildwood, NJ and Hatteras, NC are representative of these beach cottage communities. Over the observed period these places have lost a percent of seasonal housing yet have increased in population density as well as housing density. This reflects the idea that this area is a permanent coastal settlement instead of one that is based on seasonal tourist driven amenities. From the beginning of the observed period the changes in these beach cottage communities has been minimal. This is because there are other factors at play that are limiting the changing within these areas from becoming tourist and amenity driven destinations. Established Vacation communities embody an area that has been highly developed over time. These areas are ones that are not only highly developed, compared to beach cottage communities, but have high population and housing densities as well as high percentages of working age and retired age populations. These areas are representative of the urbanized coast such as north Myrtle Beach, SC and Miami Beach, FL. Over the observed period the home density was nearly equal to the population density. This ratio along with the high development density is consistent with the idea that this is a permanent barrier beach community that is fully developed yet still visited by tourist. The reason why these units are established is due in part to the high overall development of these places. With little room to grow these barrier beach communities are left to either knock down and rebuild or remain the way that they are."}, {"section_title": "New Atlantic Communities", "text": "The coupling of land availability and demand for vacation housing has likely contributed to the resulting set of New Atlantic places.

It was found that of the New Atlantic communities CBRS units had the highest rates of development change over time. This leads one to believe that there is more going on in these two categories than can be seen through this analysis. The forces driving new development or redevelopment that exist within the different units could explain the variation in land conversion as well as socioeconomic atmospheres among these different units. CBRS units also represent an opportunity to further understand how policy and policy implication reflect changes along different units. This can be due in part of the availability of land in these areas to be developed or for other reasons unknown. Further research is needed to truly understand the drivers that lead to development on these barrier beach units. The typology provides a way of clustering barrier beach units with similar socioeconomic and land cover characteristics. It is intended as a tool for coastal planners and researchers to better understand local socio-economic and land cover conditions and inform additional dialogues with local land-based planners and stakeholders. The typology names are intended to aid planners and searchers in using the typology. Like any clustering procedure there are clear limitations. First being the typology name will not directly correlate with those who live in the designated area because the naming convention is a social construct given to a generalized group of statistics. The second being the typology is merely a reflection at a given point and time and does not reflect the future, even though the future can be inferred from this research. Finally consistent data sources and interpretation measures on these areas limit the accuracy in which the data is reported and calculated. Where this research has its shortcomings is in the consistency and accuracy of data. Ideally coupling historic land cover and socio-economic data from years prior to 1990 would be ideal way to track these trends, but due to the nature of data availability accuracy and consistency becomes a problem when dealing with the scale and scope of this analysis. Along with constancy of land cover and census data is the overall accuracy and scale of land cover data. For barrier beach that represent narrow strips of ever evolving land the size and accuracy at which land cover is generated can have a profound influence on the calculations. With average width of barrier beach only being one mile in width the use of 90m, 60m, and even 30m land cover pixels, which was used in this analysis, are not ideal when measuring barrier beach island land cover. approach sets a template to organize places allowing for more detailed place-based accounts that investigate in more detail the historical trajectories and the local level policy can be performed. The product created through this research includes, in addition to class results, a data product that can be used to track all these places on in to the future. This will provide coastal policy managers a tool to track change of these places as time moves forward.       Barrier beaches are defined by Pilkey et al. (1998) as elongated bodies of sand bounded on either end by inlets that allow salt and fresh water to flow into and out of the estuary behind the system. These beaches comprise 13-15 percent of the world's coastline. The U.S. coastline from Maine to Texas contains approximately 4,350 linear kilometers of barrier beaches (USDOI 1982) and is identified by Godfrey and Leatherman as the \"longest and best evolved chain of barrier beaches in the world\" (Godfrey and Leatherman 1979). They provide the first line of defense to the mainland and adjacent wetlands, estuaries, inlets and near shore waters from the direct impact of wind waves and streams. Barrier beaches are also dynamic geomorphic features changing constantly by the actions of wind, waves, currents, and tides. Barrier beaches represent beachfront property that is highly attractive for many buyers seeking a home on the beach. As accessibility to coastal barriers increased due to improved and new roads as well as an increase in popularity of beaches as vacation destination sites, demand for development on these beaches is expected to increase. From 1945 to 1973, a total of 57,000 hectares of barrier-beach land was converted into developed land cover, which is representative of over 150% increase in developed land cover on coastal barriers (Dolan et al. 1973 increased federal spending in rescue and rebuilding efforts in these areas (Godschalk 1984;Salvesen 2005). In addition to research examining coastal population change, another important issue to investigate is the magnitudes and drivers or how human population pressure actually transforms land use and cover in barrier beach environments. Coastal Land Cover Change (CLCC) has been explored in past research (Klemas et al. 1993;Corssett et al. 2004;Ellis et al. 2011), but there has yet to be an accepted explanation of the processes that influence the conversion of land to become developed in coastal regions. CLCC is influenced by anthropogenic means (Dolan et al. 1973;Stiffin 1981;Crawford 2007) \nThe  (Pawlukiewicz 2007;Lambin et al. 2001;Rudel et al. 2005) illustrate that a central task facing the discipline is the understanding of forces that drive land cover change especially coastal land cover change. Secondly, this study adds to the coastal resource management literature on drivers of coastal development (Bartlett et al.2000 andCrossett et al. 2004). In particular, it provides an outlook into the multiple forces that contribute to development, compares, and contrasts them. Finally, the research builds on recent efforts to analyze driving forces, including the call to study landscape change in coastal regions.

The use of parcel data and historical documentation will also be used as a way to quantify patterns of development and to describe important events that inhibit or restrict developed land cover change from occurring. This research will extend research efforts in classifying and determining drivers of barrier beach communities. It draws on results from the prior quantitative chapters (3 and 4) and extends them to look in a more nuanced way at particular places with particular place-based histories. This approach disentangles the nuances that quantitative and statistical approaches cannot answer. As a result this research creates descriptive analysis techniques that can be applied to any and all coastal barriers using this model. While the details of the results will differ the overarching structural framework will create a consistent method to understanding place based coastal land cover change. Changes in the social structure during the late 19 th and continuing on to the 20 th century in the United States have shaped and reshaped the patterns, in which LUCC has occurred. Societal structure in terms of this research is referring to the organizational makeup of a society and their interactions and intention, within and on the landscape (Stinchcombe 1965). To assess societal structure, a historic approach is used because of its ability to explain the main groups of actors shaping the landscape change over time. Human behavior and its interaction with the landscape are cultivated by shifting of needs and the demands of society (Burgi et al. 2004). Land cover change occurs in both space as well as time, thus making the integration of LUCC practices and history a means for understanding processes (Burgi and Russell 2001). In LUCC research, people are seen as one piece amongst various others that change the region being studied. History uses land cover or setting of events as just one piece among many that are observed. Historians and landscape ecologists may view the same landscape, but draw different conclusions from the landscape making collaboration uncommon (Meine 1999). It is the collaboration between historical contexts and landscape research that allows greater detailed local land cover change to be explored and understood. It takes into account the nuances that are at many times lost through the observation of larger picture ideas or many of the times outside of the focus of the individual researcher.  (Dolan et al. 1973). This change represents a total of raw increase of 8.3% of all barrier beach land that developed over this time period (Dolan et al. 1973;Zhang and Leatherman 2011). Since 1973 developed land cover has continued to increase on barrier beaches in support of new residents and tourism industry. In 2007 about 85% of tourist-related revenues in coastal states are largely due to the popularity of beaches (Houston 2008). Based on estimation in 2007, approximately 180 million Americans make 2 billion visits to beaches each year (Houston 2008). It is projected that population density in coastal counties from 2010 to 2020 will grow to be more than three times (93 people per square kilometers) more than that of non-coastal counties (28 people per square kilometer) (Woods and Pole Economics Inc. 2011). Increasing populations pressures and dependence on these places to generate revenue (mainly from tourism) create need to study and understand the changing trends and patterns that emerge as a result of developed land cover conversion. Landscape dynamics and its effects on regions have been widely studied during the last two decades (Forman and Godron 1986;Lasanta, 1988;MacGarigal and Marks 1995;Poyatos et al. 2003;Lasanta et al. 2005;Farina 2006): there have been few that look at local scale. Furthermore, land cover change studies in coastal regions have occurred at different national and state and county scales (Crawford 2007). Local scale research in coastal areas is important because much of the research done is at large scales that many times include coastal and noncoastal regions but explicitly investigate differences in patterns and processes occurring for solely coastal areas. Local studies however provide the spatial and temporal resolution required to identify and account for major variations that may occur in land cover change (Turner II et al. 1994). There are few place based studies compared to larger scale studies because they require more time to investigate and demand high quality land cover data to observe change (Geist and Lambin 2002). The mass produced 30-meter raster data sets (i.e. National Land Cover Database and NOAA C-CAP) are used more readily and reported on because of availability, cost, and scale of many studies. Research at the local scale has the ability to identify different land cover indicators that are only observed at the local scale (Borak et al. 2000). Local research allows for an understanding of local processes, which can in turn be applied to larger scale research and processes (Vogelmann et al. 1998)."}, {"section_title": "Drivers of CLCC", "text": "This study will assess the CLCC drivers on barrier beaches that induce land use conversion to developed status. Traditionally Land Change Science (LCS) research seeks to comprehend, explain, and project land use and land-cover change (Turner 2002;Turner et al. 2007). The key themes of LCS include the identification of patterns of land cover change, processes of land use change, human responses to land use/cover change, integrated global and regional models, and development of databases on land surface, biophysical processes, and their drivers (IGBP 1999). Land change science modeling has developed or adopted a variety of approaches, which include the narrative, the agent based, and the systems approach perspectives (Lambin et al. 2003). categories can be used to assess the factors correlated with land cover change (Loveland et al. 1991;Turner et al. 1996;Wear et al. 1998;Mertens and Lambin 2000;Lu et al. 2005). Drivers are the thematic processes hypothesized to cause observed landscape changes. They are influential processes in the evolutionary trajectory of the landscape. When looking at drivers of landscape change, Ray and Gregg (1991) stated that development on coastal barriers has been made possible due in part to the exceptional recreational amenities, the proximity of urban centers, sophisticated engineering capabilities, and a growing number of corporate and individual investors. From and environmental perspective, development on coastal barriers is subject to the full brunt of winds, waves, and tides, which required increasing investments to protect the development and to repair damage from natural forces (USDI 1983). Adapted from Marcucci (2000), B\u00fcrgi and Hersperger (2004), Hersperger and B\u00fcrgi (2009), Forman et al. (2003 and2009), Berling-Wolff and Wu (2004), driving forces for coastal landscapes include factors from the spatial, social, natural, and policy drivers that changes to developed land cover. This research takes into account LCS studies that have determined drivers of LUCC and attempts to add to this knowledge by creating a set of CLCC drivers. There are many drivers that act on the coastal landscape from socioeconomic, spatial, and natural drivers interacting and changing the land cover change within the coastal region (Figure 4-1). Informed by the coastal literature, certain drivers overlooked in traditional LCS studies have been added to traditional findings to create a uniquely coastal set of LUCC drivers (Table 4-1) that will be empirically evaluated in statistical models aiming to explain variation in levels of Atlantic developed land cover change using a place-based quantitative approach where places, as opposed to pixels, are used as the unit of analysis. These drivers will be tested to see if they in fact play a role in change to developed land cover during the study period."}, {"section_title": "Natural Drivers", "text": "Natural drivers most relevant to coastal barriers according to the identified literature in Table 4-1 include a mix of both physical processes (i.e. coastal storms and coastal erosion) as well as landscape features (i.e. wetlands and elevations depicted in flood zones) of the U.S. east coast. This is important to note because barrier beaches are formed primarily of sand and generally include features such as a sandy beach, dunes (both primary and secondary), maritime forest, wetlands, and a backshore comprised mainly of marsh. Bodies of water (sounds and lagoons) generally separate the barrier beach from the mainland. Barrier beaches have an extremely dynamic nature whereby major changes in geomorphology and hydrology can occur over days, or even hours, in response to extreme episodic storm events (EESEs) such as tropical cyclones, hurricanes, and northeasters (Feagin et al. 2010). Several recent studies have addressed the vulnerability of U.S. coastal communities to contemporary natural hazards, especially extreme coastal storms (Clark et al. 1998;David et al. 1999;Mileti 1999;Morrow 1999;Cutter et al. 2000). Changes in the overall land cover change may be influenced by vulnerability of these settlements to coastal hazards, including the increasing risks due to climate change and sealevel rise, versus adaptation measures that could reduce risk (Smit et al. 2001). Natural hazard risks in the coastal zone include storms (hurricanes and nor'easters on the east coast), with associated flooding and wind damage, as well as erosion stemming from storms and sea level rise (Bin and Kruse 2006). Filatova and Veen van der (2006) looked land cover change in relation to flooding and found that humans were influenced by areas that flooded crating a negative correlation in development in those areas.

It has also been found that the age of population influences the amount of land cover change that occurs (Coressett et al. 2004;VanWey et al.2007). Millington et al. (2007) found that the mean farmer's age of a population explained for eleven percent of the variance for transition from agricultural land to scrubland. Income and housing value were also found to play influential roles in creation and curbing of developed land cover (Riebsame et al.1996;Irwin 2002;Evans and Kelley 2004).

Housing density like road density is a spatial driver that has been found to increase developed land cover change (Vitousek et al. 1997;Liu et al. 2003;Westervelt et al.2011). Proximity to populations is another spatial driver that has been found that a that land-cover change is inversely related to distance to populated areas tends where the further the population the less developed land cover change (Turner 1990;LaGro and DeGloria 1992;Bockstael 1996;Turner et al. 1996;Mertens 1997;Wear et al. 1998).

Due to the high complexity of local policy it makes creating an effective method to measure these policies hard (Lambin 1998;Geyer and Rihani 2010). State policies, similar to local, have a varying degree of impact on CLCC based on states individual motivation and ideologies. The varying degree of policy focus and enforcing amongst states creates unique coastal policies, which, like local policy is hard to effectively measure. While local as well as state policies pertaining to CLCC have varying degrees of implementation as well as effectiveness federal policies are easier to address in terms of implementation and enforcement (Godschalk 1992;Hershman et al. 2007). At the federal level policy with no alteration is applied to all areas with consistent focus and enforcement. This study will specifically look at the federal level policy specifically the Coastal Barrier Resources Act of 1982 (CBRA). The CBRA's stated purpose is to: (1) minimize loss of human life by discouraging development in high risk areas, (2) reduce wasteful expenditures of federal resources, and (3) protect the natural resources associated with coastal barriers. Research by Godschalk (1984) and Kuehn (1984) found that CBRA had slowed the development rate on certain undeveloped barriers where withdrawal of Federal flood insurance or infrastructure assistance coupled with local constraints.

NWI polygons will be imported and clipped to the Study area units. Erosion risk was calculated through the use of USGS transect data containing a linear erosion rate in meters per year for transects spaced approximately 50 meters apart spanning the entire extent of the study area (Himmelstoss et al. 2010). Erosion rates were extrapolated out 60 years from year 2000 to create eroded area polygons assuming a constant linear rate of erosion. Analysis was restricted to area only within 150 meters (500 feet) of the year 2000 shoreline. The final erosion risk measure was calculated as percent of the area within 150 meters (500 feet) of the shoreline (Crawford and Bennett 2012) that would be eroded assuming a linear extrapolation of historical rates into the future. Linear historical extrapolation can be critiqued due to the fact that is a simple statistical technique that does not incorporate coastal geophysical processes or human adaptive or mitigative behaviors. Despite this limitation, it relies on erosion data from a respected source (i.e. USGS) and arguably provides a first order characterization of erosion variability at the place-based level of analysis used in research."}, {"section_title": "Social Variables", "text": "Social data were assembled from the 1990 and 2000 U.S. Census block and block group data.

Population and population over 65 are determined through the centroid method, which creates a point in the center of the block group, which represents all the data for that block group. The data is then overlaid on top of the barrier beach unit boundaries and sums are calculated. To calculate population density, the population for 1990 was divided "}, {"section_title": "Spatial Variables", "text": "Spatial variables were quantified using Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing system (TIGER) road files; census identified urban centers 1990 and 2000, and 1990 and 2000 Census housing data. Seasonal housing data were assembled from the 1990 and 2000 U.S. Census block data. Using TIGER road files, road density of major roadways were quantified as the length of the road per acres within each unit. Taking the centroids of each block that fall within the prescribed unit, housing counts were calculated for each unit. The density of development and seasonal housing units will be calculated through using the census data and dividing them by the total available land per unit. Population accessibility will be measured using a gravitational distance decay measure to show the extent of population that has access to identified barrier beach units (Fotheringham 1981;Song 1996). Population accessibility is a quantitative metric that provides a relative measure of measures of population accessibility to a given barrier beach unit. A simple gravitational distance decay measure was applied using 1990 and 2000 census data. The formula is as follows: Where: is the potential number of attracted to barrier beach M is the population census tract D is the distance between barrier unit and place In the gravitational equation, i is identified as census-defined populated places from within the barrier beaches units. In cases where units did not contain a populated place, the barrier beach's centroid was used. Census tracts j were identified using radial distances of 25, 50, and 100 km from the populated place points and centroids of the barrier beach units to centroids of 1990 and 2000 census tracts. Units that had more than one populated place had their multiple values averaged to get a final accessibility measure for barrier beach unit.

While the control variable, available land is significant and has the largest influence compared to all other variables as would be expected ceteris paribus, the focus is to assess the influence of the other variables. Variables with at least a p = 0.05 significance or lower were considered here as statistically significant.

Although there are many variables in the models relative to the actual number of observations in the sample of barrier beach units, problems with multicollinearity are not evident. The highest variance inflation factor (VIF) for any variable is 4.39 (Table 4-6), which is clearly within generally acceptable guidelines (Allison, 1999). The potential for biased results due to spatial autocorrelation, or relative closeness of units, was assessed using the Moran's I statistic applied to standardized residuals for all models. The formula used to calculate autocorrelation was done through the use of ArcGIS' Moran's I statistics: Where: is the deviation of an attribute for feature from its mean ( \u2212 \ufffd ) , is the spatial weight between feature and is equal to the total number of features is the aggregate of all the spatial weights Results of Moran's I of the residuals revealed z-scores and p-values indicating the absence of spatially autocorrelated residuals thus justifying the use of OLS regression (Table 4-8).

Thus, these model diagnostics indicate that the use of OLS regression was acceptable and did not violate required assumptions."}, {"section_title": "Coastal Restructuring Theory", "text": "The notion of coastal restructuring is derived from current bodies of knowledge in rural landscape settings. Rural landscapes, much like coastal landscapes have become more valuable for the amenities they provide than the functionality of the landscape itself (Bell 1994;Deller et al. 2001;Whitson 2001;Fl\u00f8ysand and Jacobsen 2007). The change in value of land has led to the conversion of once productive farming land to developments for consumptive activities like tourism and new homes. From these changes new landscapes emerge, where through the creation of new amenities (seasonal and service-based economy) the social structure is altered and LUCC moves toward a new direction (Van Auken and Rye 2011). Coastal restructuring occurs at different temporal and spatial areas and because of this a model tailored to uniquely coastal areas is adapted from Holmes (2008 and (Figure 5-1). The model provides critical information that can be used by coastal planners and managers as to how landscape transitions over time. This would have the potential to aid in planning and predicting land use changes that have and may occur over time. The model follows the development path of each selected coastal landscape from its original use to its current use. The model evaluates the changing uses and social patterns that exist within the selected community. The model identifies three core uses of landscapes: production, consumption, and protection. Within these three uses of landscapes, there are seven unique phases in landscape transformation, that is extractive (production dominant), extractive amenity (production and consumption), amenity (consumption dominant), marginalized extractive (production and protection), conservation (protection emphasized), managed amenity (protection and consumption), and multidimensional (production, consumption and protection all existent). The phases are representative of potential social landscape uses at a singular time period. If these landscape uses are combined with other observed uses at different times for the same landscape, potentially a path of societal landscape use can be identified."}, {"section_title": "Conceptual Framework of Societal LUCC", "text": "To analyze the connection between societal structure and LUCC of barrier beaches, a conceptual framework is created to explain landscape change in context to the existing societal system. This framework requires a method that explains LUCC in context to the coupling of regulating forces along with socio-economic forces on landscape alteration. This aids in explanation of the modifications to the landscape as well as the spatial and temporal trends existing within a society. This framework creates an analysis that explains the variation and development changes on a landscape based on the social system that exists on the landscape. A societal framework was adapted from Solecki et al. (1999) who developed a historical interpretative approach for South Florida landscape trajectories to explain how coastal Florida evolved and change over time ( Figure 5-2). Regulating forces and socio-economic forces work within the societal system in relation to landscape conversion. Regulating forces are forces that can restrict or expand landscape change due to societal inputs. These regulating forces include government influence, market responses, and management of resources. All these regulating forces can both limit as well as inhibit landcover change from occurring. Similar to regulating forces, socio-economic forces are taken into account through the observation of population, economy, technology, and ideals that contribute to the changing barrier beach landscape. Analysis of the socio-economic forces are not intended to cover the entire scope of societal concerns, but have significant influence on society's interactions with the landscape (Solecki et al. 1999). These forces deviate from that of regulating forces because many times regulating forces can be part of larger systems while socio-economic forces isolate local structure of area of interest. Socio-economic forces act in conjunction with controlling forces to explain the land cover change. The second part of this framework is concerned with landcover interactions on the societal system. As land cover is converted over time due to societal system forces, the model responds back in the system. Every change within the framework responds and influences all factors within the system. Taking the societal LUCC framework along with the coastal restructuring model a visualized path of change can be expressed. Describing and accounting for observed factors over a given time period and inductively applying it to the societal LUCC framework provides a point identifying a particular landscape phase. Identifying and connecting multiple sequential points trace out a phase diagram summarizing a place's landscape evolution. The phase diagram created through this model is similar to the Tourism Life Cycle proposed by Butler (1980). The tourism life cycle found that a tourist area underwent 6 phases throughout its history. These stages included exploration, involvement, development, consolidation, stagnation, and the sixth and final phase an area range from being rejuvenated to going into decline. While the tourism lifecycle model is concerned with strictly tourism the coastal restructuring model goes beyond this because not all landscapes are used solely for tourism. An example of this is if there was a heavy concentration of fishing, farming, and hunting identified within the framework it can be implied that over that time period the landscape was extractive and productive in nature. If the societal influences were geared towards development and bringing people to the beach it would fall within amenity and consumption landscape phase for that period. By linking different time periods through both the coastal restructuring model and societal LUCC framework a path of overall societal influenced land cover change can be observed as well as explained."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "The research will use a descriptive analytical and interpretive approach to understand the historical trajectory of development in each unit at the local scale through the use of secondary data sources (i.e. books, newspaper articles, and land use plans). Secondary data sources are used to construct a historical narrative of land cover change spanning a period from the mid-1800s through 2000. Parcel data will be combined with the historical narratives to analyze the relative impact of historical occurrences using the conceptual framework of societal LUCC. The evolution of the regions has certain intangible traits that can influence the overall landscape and how people and policy have changed it. The historical narratives of LUCC on the selected units follow a three stage approach as where the areas' histories are broken up into distinct time periods (Solecki et al. 1999). These stages represent a physical change in development patterns as well as changes in social aspects and policy acting on the landscape. The results will then be applied to the coastal restructuring model to show the path of landscape change over the observed periods."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The historical narratives are created in part through the use of historical documents and parcel data that pertain to each selected unit. Due to the historical time frame and scale of this research, remotely sensed land cover data were insufficient to create a longitudinal picture of development on the selected barrier beach units. Residential parcel data were used for this local research because they allow for space and time; two necessary attributes for localized land cover change, to be identified. The residential parcel data show both historically (the year the parcel was developed) and spatially (parcel level scale) developed land cover change over time. Due to lack of population data for the observed period aggregated at the local place level, parcel data also act as an indicator of development over time. The parcel data for Long Beach were acquired from the Nassau County Tax Assessors office, and Currituck County Planning Department provided the data for Currituck Banks."}, {"section_title": "Historical Narrative Stages", "text": "In order to create a reputable method to determine stages, a numerical classification, in which numbers (i.e. parcels developed) are grouped according to some criteria of similarity, is used. This classification creates uniform groups so that numerical difference within groups is less than the differences between groups (Dent 1999). To achieve this, Jenks Natural Breaks Method was applied to the parcel data for both Long Beach and Currituck Banks. The parcels developed were totaled for each year by taking the last year's total with the current year giving a cumulative total of developed parcel for that given point in time. The data were then put into Jenks Natural Breaks or Optimization Method, which creates groups that are internally homogeneous while assuring heterogeneity among classes (Dent 1999). The measure created from this method is called the Goodness of Variance Fit (GVF), which is a minimizing procedure where the smallest sum of squared deviations is sought (Jenks and Coulson 1963). The Equation is as follows: Where: The completed results for the Jenks Method allows for the parcel data to be separated into distinct homogeneous stages. For this research three stages were chosen to express the simple progression of the landscape over time as seen in Solecki et al. (1999). The preferred number of stages can be adjusted and interpreted to the research parameters, keeping in mind that the larger number of stages would in turn intensify the research and focus of the study. The larger the number of stages requires increase in data to correctly identify the stage of the landscape. Names are given to each of the three stages to be reflective of the nature of the transitive landcover change occurring during each stage. The first stage is similar to Butler's (1980) 5.5.1 Frontier Stage 1879-1925 Long Beach is located on the southern shore of Long Island; three miles beyond the mainland ( Figure 5-4). It originally began as a \"resort\" of only fishermen and hunters of water fowl. Its favorable summer and winter temperatures and proximity to New York City made it an ideal place for a year-round resort (Hazelton 1925). The framework for transforming Long Beach into a year-round resort began in 1879 when the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) employed William Laffan, publisher of the New York Sun, to negotiate a deal with the Town of Hempstead for development rights (Kellard 2010a). Laffan was able to secure a lease for $300 with the Town of Hempstead allowing access for the LIRR along with an additional clause that forbid steamboat access. That same year the Town of Hempstead secured a 100-year lease with the \"Long Beach Improvement Company,\" developers of the Long Beach Hotel (Figure 5-5). The Hotel was 274 meters long and 152 meters wide with 27 cottages and a bathing house, which at the time was the world's largest seaside resort (Saccardi & Schiff Inc. 2007). The following year the LIRR began to bring city people to the Long Beach and Long Beach Hotel and over time the area continued to develop as a tourist resort. In 1905 access to the beach was in such high demand that a trolley line had to be run from the train station to the beach (Hazelton 1925). The Long Beach Improvement Company, the lease holding company at the time, was purchased early in 1906 by a group of investors (Hazelton 1925). Amongst these investors was William Reynolds, a 24-year old from Brooklyn credited with the creation in 1903 of Coney Island's largest amusement park, Dreamland (Jackson 2002). Reynolds and his associates announced that they would expend a development budget from eight million to ten million dollars in building another Atlantic City. They envisioned an eight-mile chain of modern hotels and cottages adapted for year-round occupancy (Hazelton 1925). This new vision for Long Beach was halted when in 1907 a massive fire destroyed the Long Beach Hotel leaving only the sixteen foot wide fireplace that ran through the center of the hotel. About eight hundred guests escaped the inferno during which only five persons were injured with no fatalities (Hazelton 1925). In the shadow of the fire, Reynolds continued with his new vision of an expansive boardwalk lined with lavish hotels ( Figure 5-6). In the fall of 1907 Reynolds brought his vision to reality when he brought several elephants from Coney Island to haul lumber. Not only was it a spectacle to see, the elephants were capable of hauling lumber more effectively than horses could. The completed boardwalk stretched a length of 3.5 kilometers long fifteen meters wide lined by electric lights and over 3,500 concrete piles and girders (Hazelton 1925). In 1908 Reynolds continued his vision for Long Beach when he plotted the first residential parcels of his designed community, \"The Estates\", built as part of the planned resort community phase (Kellard 2012). The community consisted of large villa-style formal homes regulated by strict building standards that dictated the property size and the esthetics of homes and streets (red tile roofs and white stucco walls and red brick streets) (Saccardi & Schiff Inc. 2007). Development continued in the winter of 1908 when three steam dredges were put to work, twenty-four hours a day, to dredge the channel eight kilometers long, four meters deep, and 335 meters wide (Hazelton 1925). This dredging converted hundreds of acres of swamp and meadows into solid land on the backside of Long Beach Island. Moving roughly 46,000 cubic meters of sand a day the dredging was regarded as the biggest sand moving undertaking (Hazelton 1925). The Nassau Hotel was built in 1909 designed for year-round occupancy it was known and publicized as the fireproof hotel (Kellard 2011a) ( Figure 5-7). The Hotel was built in the shape of an \"H\" and stretched 90 meters along the boardwalk and 15 meters back on each end (Hazelton 1925). Legal gambling came to a halt in 1910 when New York State banned all casinos and gambling. Change in regulations forced developers to shift focus from lavish resorts in favor of built seasonal communities. As neighborhoods began to develop, Long Beach became an incorporated village in 1912 and began its transition from summer to year-round community (Jackson 2002). With new year-round homes being developed along with a trolley system bringing residents and visitors around the newly developed neighborhoods, Long Beach entered into the development stage (Jackson 2002). Starting in 1918 the Walks neighborhood was created over a ten-block span using pre-fabricated housing meant as summer bungalows. The Walks homes were unique because they were designed having no direct street access, driveways, or garages (Kellard 2011b). As the permanent resident population increased, Reynolds finally got his wish in 1922 when Long Beach was granted status of city making it the city by the sea. That very year Reynolds was elected Mayor of Long Beach. The city used its new status to get at the time the largest reduction in Suburban Fire Insurance giving Long Beach residents the lowest base rate of anyone in Nassau County (Hazelton 1925). In 1922 the city replaced the wooden bridge with what was dubbed as the \"Million Dollar Bridge\" which cut through the dredged Reynolds channel . The \"Million Dollar Bridge\" was the first of three bridges to be built over an eight year period to be built connecting Long Beach to the mainland ( Figure 5-8). Stage 1926Stage -1950 After the Million Dollar Bridge was completed many other transportation projects became underway. These projects provided new access to Long Beach, which increased the desire of people to develop on the island. The Far Rockaway Bridge was one such project that connected Long Beach at the west end in 1927 as well as the Loop Parkway Bridge, a product of the Works Progress Administration (WPA), opened to the east in 1930 (Fiore et al. 2010). In 1935 the boardwalk was in a state of disrepair after harsh winter storms. As a way to protect the boardwalk and residents from the ocean's waves, jetties were built and the boardwalk was rebuilt by FDR's WPA (Kellard 2011a). New bridges, paved roads, hardened beach structures, and increased housing stock made Long Beach attractive to increasing numbers of year-round residents. Population change according to the US census showed that Long Beach grew from just a few hundred permanent residents in 1910 to 5,817 in 1930 and nearly doubling to 9,036 in 1940 reflecting growth due to increased access and housing availability."}, {"section_title": "Development", "text": "The growth of the population of Long Beach was brought to a halt when the island was appropriated by the US Navy in 1942. The Navy used the Lido Hotel as a barracks, whose 300 reservations for that season had to be canceled. After World War II the beach cottages that were once meant for summer residents began to evolve into year-round residences. There was also a large increase in housing growth similar to the pre World War II development. While yearround hotels began to fall out of favor, family-oriented hotels were constructed allowing the Long Beach to accommodate a summer population of more than 70,000 residents (Saccardi & Schiff, Inc. 2007)."}, {"section_title": "Post Development Stage 1951-2000", "text": "After World War II the appeal of Long Beach as a seasonal vacation destination began to decline in favor of more year-round communities. As more permanent residents moved into Long Beach so did the need for public facilities for them. In place of the year-round resorts, beachfront parks and clubs developed to facilitate the needs of the community. Along with increasing permanent population, new advances in technology began to sway vacation populations away from Long Beach in favor of more previously unreachable/undesirable destinations, like Florida and California. Technological advances such as air conditioning and air travel allowed populations to travel longer distances to destinations where climate is not an influencing factor (Saccardi & Schiff, Inc. 2007). These advances caused a decline in the tourist population that had once flocked to the boardwalk. This in turn has left the once lavish beachside hotels that had teemed with vacationers in the 1920s 30s and 40s vacant. The decline of Long Beach may have begun due to advances in technology, but changes in policy and population caused the landscape to transition away from an amenity-oriented place. Most if not all of these policies were put into place after much of the land in Long Beach had already become developed. At the federal level the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (CZMA) encouraged the responsible economic, cultural and recreational growth of the coastal zones through funding for states to create their own management plans (Owens 1992 5.6.1 Frontier Stage 1854-1970 Currituck Banks began as a remote, isolated region cut off from the outside surrounded by large bodies of water -\"an easier place to talk about than visit\" (Yucom 2000). Originally hunting clubs and farming dominated the relatively undeveloped landscape. Parcel development originally occurred on the sound side of the barrier beach ( Figure 5-9). The livelihood of the farmer residents along with the strong market-hunting industry created a high value for protecting any significant development occurring on the landscape (Figure 5-10). This in turn created a landscape that was focused on the production of goods through farming and hunting and the protection of the landscape. The Currituck Banks is a part of a larger barrier island spit much of the frontier history is directly connected to areas north and south of the unit. In 1857 Valentine Hicks, a New York businessman, and 14 of his associates purchased a large piece of land and constructed the Currituck Shooting Club (Austin et al. 2006). As a way to aid shippers through the night, the Currituck Beach Lighthouse was built in 1875 at a height of 162 feet and over a million bricks. The area continued to remain untouched until after the Civil War when many more hunting clubs like Currituck Shooting Club were created. This is evident in the parcel records when in 1914 there were a reported total of 31 parcels developed, all of which were located on the sound side for hunting related purposes. Due to lack of restrictions a record kill of 892 ruddy ducks in one day was made by Russell and Vann Griggs (Critcher 1949). Subsequent to 1918 the large increase in hunting clubs along with market hunting industry of waterfowl lead to laws limiting the amount of fowl that could be hunted (Austin et al. 2006). The Migratory Bird Act of 1918 made it illegal to hunt, take, capture, kill or sell birds identified as migratory for commercial hunting. It also regulated the amount of foul that could be hunted per day. In 1922 Edward and Marie-Louise LeBell Knight, avid hunters, began work on the Corolla Island hunting facility, a 2,100 square meter building located on the sound side just south of Currituck Banks in Corolla (later renamed as the Whalehead Club) (Austin et al. 2006) ( Figure 5-11). It was finished in 1925 and employed many of the local men as hunting guides for the many visitors the club entertained. In 1928 a group of citizens and county officials sponsored the construction of a toll bridge connecting the Currituck mainland with the Banks (Stick 1973 [5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12]. Even though bridges had the means of transporting people across the water, the roads were merely trails through the wooded areas and the beach was used as the major highway across the Island (Dunbar 1959). The inception of bridges and eventually roads to the banks began to change the landscape as well as the culture of the banks due to improved spatial accessibility. The improvements of roads allowed cars once delegated to drive in sand ruts along the beach to move freely up and down the barrier beach ( Figure 5-13). The creation and improvement of access brought a new culture to the Banks. The shifting needs of the barrier islands was representative of a new demand for land and changing ideals about the ways in which these barrier islands would be used (Lee 2008). Land originally seen as least valued by current residents due to its high vulnerability was prized by new tourist-driven development, in which closeness to the ocean as well as ocean views were highly valued (Birkemeier et al. 1984). Bankers, residents of the Outer Banks, saw the land as a common space where they plotted out individual gardens and used the remaining space as commons. The Bankers reacted to the harsh coastal conditions through living reactively to the landscape moving their homes as they became placed in danger while developers in contrast sought to draw lines in the sand that insisted to investors that the land would stay in place in the face of migrating dunes and storm surges (Lee 2008). With new development came a new shift in the economy where a Banker of many skills became a man focused on a singular occupation (Dunbar 1959). From 1870 to 1950 the leading occupation on the banks was fishing (Stick 1958). Government work programs such as the Civilian Conservation Corps, Works Progress Administration, and the National Youth Administration employed nearly a quarter of the banks population from 1920 to 1930 and in 1940 more than a third of the population (Dunbar 1959;Lee 2008). The project changed the geomorphic process of the barrier islands through the building of high dunes and plant stabilizing grasses along the oceanfront (Birkemeier et al. 1984;Senter 2003). This stabilization allowed for increased protection from storm surges in turn changing the location of new homes from the sound side to the coast. While the banks became stabilized the permanent population began to move to the mainland in search of jobs leaving many small villages and towns abandoned scattered across the northern Outer Banks (Austin et al. 2006). In the 1960s large tracts of land previously held by hunting clubs were sold off to developers who began to develop the area into subdivisions. In 1967 the first subdivision in Currituck Banks, Currituck Banks Beach, was plotted and canals were dug and bulkheads were put in to accommodate small boats. Following Currituck Banks subdivision was Swan Beach in 1969 and North Swan Beach in 1971 (Bennett 2010). The subdivisions were designed in grid patterns and the major developer of the time, Kabler and Riggs Reality, sold off thousands of lot to individual investors (Owens 1980 (Owens 1980). 5.6.2 Development Stage 1971-1985 The into place. The Currituck Plan was never adopted and development continued to occur, but there was a new effort to preserve some of the land that was so highly sought after (Owens 1980 (Owens 1980). In December of 1979 the draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) was issued for the Currituck National Wildlife Refuge (CNWLR). The USFWS wanted to control all of Currituck Banks and the Wetlands to the south of Corolla to the Dare County line (USFWS 1979). The USFWS estimated that the cost to purchase the area would have exceeded $100 million, which would at the time have made it the most expensive single refuge purchase (Owens 1980USFWS 1979. The high price of the land made purchasing all tracts unattainable.  5.6.3 Post Development Stage 1986 In the years following the extension of NC 12 to the boundary of Currituck Banks minimal improvements to infrastructure have occurred. Parcels are plotted and graded sand roads are the only physical indicators of where parcels begin and end. Today many people may identify the Currituck Banks based on the features of its landscape. These features include its lack of roads, massive beach mansions, and the wild ponies that roam the area. It is these features along with large expanse of undeveloped or natural barrier beach environment. These landscape features make the Currituck Banks a unique landscape onto itself, unlike as Orrin Pilkey and others state the New Jerseyization of the shoreline with its stabilized shoreline and boardwalk, like that of Long Beach (Pilkey et al. 1998). Even though there is limited accessibility, people still continue to develop on Currituck Banks at greater magnitudes than that seen in decades before. Part of this could be the connection to nature, but other forces including lack of available land in southern villages has allowed for steady housing development to occur. Advances in both home building and transportation have allowed people to both live and travel to this remote place and live in relative luxury, even though they are removed from any form of supporting infrastructure. Privatized flood insurance is another important factor allowing for development to occur because NFIP is removed from this area under the CBRA legislation. The availability of private insurance from coastal hazards makes these areas worth developing to those who have the means to pay to ensure. The advancements in technology along with creation of privatized flood insurance have allowed for these homes to exist like sandcastles in the dunes jutting out of the landscape surrounded by the natural barrier beach environment. There have been many attempts, including the Fruitville Beach Service District proposed, by developers and some land owners to create paved and improved access in Currituck Banks. To their dismay all of these attempts have been turned down in favor of preserving the area. Even with no road access there still remains a seemingly natural draw to the region and continued development in a place devoid of roads. Current Currituck County zoning regulations limit development to low-density housing with minimum lot sizes of 0.6 hectares."}, {"section_title": "Results and Discussion", "text": "Applying the historical narrative and conceptual framework on the coastal restructuring model creates a path of how the societal influences on the landscape have transitioned over time. As seen in More importantly this research can be transitive in its application to other barrier beach units. This is true because the study revealed that units with both above and below average characteristics, different proximities, and different classifications can be charted and observed successfully. This new discourse in understanding is reflective of the nature and change that has been seen in coastal regions social, political and physical make up. While researching in this manner is time consuming, the benefits of this research at the local scale explain variables many times overlooked in larger regional, national and especially global scales. Like all places these coastal units have an identity all to themselves that localized research not only explores, but explains the trends and patterns that emerge. The conceptual framework of societal LUCC provides a tool to underrating the social factors that act upon barrier beach landscape. These factors, many times, go unseen when looking at the physical features a landscape embodies. It is the unseen socio-economic as well as regulating forces interactions with one another as well as with landscape conversion that change occurs. This change is reactant upon all features as one connected unit. Taking the historical narratives created and applying the histories to this framework that an understanding of how the landscape is used and viewed by the society is created. This in turn helps to define the created stages land uses as it transitions from one stage to another.

The accuracy of this conceptual framework is largely dependent upon data input into it. The coastal restructuring model shows that a places societal constructed landscape preferences could be charted over time. The model and process can be used in the future to explore other coastal LUCC process in a similar manner. Social history and its interaction with the physical landscape can be seen as one where trends and practices at the local level that have an influence as to how a landscape will move throughout the coastal restructuring model. When policy is placed into the framework it reveals that it is not as much implementation of the policy, but rather timing of implementation. Comparing Long Beach and Currituck Banks reveals that when government interaction as far as controlling growth occurred Long Beach had already been heavily developed as opposed to Currituck Banks which had been sparsely developed. This makes policy implementation acutely related to the timing in regards to impacting societal notions of land conversion. When looking at the utility and practical application of the Coastal Restructuring Model one can look towards coastal planners and managers as key inputs into the model. Planners and managers who in their own right have vital local knowledge of the local landscape can be used in the coastal restructuring model in place of data inputs and detailed parcel data. They can take these models and sketch out paths instead of generating historical documentation and parcel data. This would in turn increase generation of models and potentially could create a complete picture for the entire coast to be done, instead of just two places. If these paths could be created for the whole coastline it would allow for planners and managers to evaluate their own paths as well as look at places with similar and different paths. They can also view places they feel who are ideal to them and see how their landscape transitioned over time. Viewing how other landscapes transitioned over time can allow planners and managers to see where they need to move towards in the future to get to their ideal landscape. The research expands upon the work of Solecki et al. (1999), Light and Dineen (1994), and McCally (1999) adding to the existing body of knowledge of the bridging of LUCC and historical narratives as a way to assess detailed spatial and temporal change over time. This detailed spatial and temporal change allows research to be done accurately at the unit level instead of at a regional one. The study improves the understanding of human intervention in the environment because it replaces generic forces, found at a regional scale, with the primary institutional actor's forces, found at the local scale, whose choices and pressures create the dynamic of the environment overlooked in many LUCC studies. Developed land does not change by itself over time; it is the interaction of the people with the land that changes it. Like development, policy does not act on a place without a reaction to changing. The landscape and people policy is connected will affect the overall change. If the proper degree of understanding between land use change people and policy is achieved, then these ideas and the process of change can be understood, which can ultimately be projected for future understating. The coastal restructuring model allows for this process of landscape evolution to be seen as well as predicted based on observing current and future trends ultimately charting the course for the future based on knowledge of place."}, {"section_title": "Epilogue", "text": "Hurricane Sandy hit Long Beach on October 30, 2012 creating mass destruction in its path. The Boardwalk and jetties put in place along the beach were destroyed along with thousands of homes having large amounts of damage or even being destroyed. In the wake of this disaster the City of Long Beach is left with new decisions as to how to rebuild as well as how to preserve the legacies of the past. While it is for now a year-round residence for many, only time will tell if it will remain so after the rebuilding and restructuring of the community occurs. Chapter 6: Conclusion Barrier beaches are ever evolving and moving narrow strips of land pushed back by nature and held in place by man becoming over time popular destinations to live and play. The convergence of people and place have transitioned and altered many of these places from what they once were to some form of developed coastline. Whether the development is representative of low density beach cottages or a completely urban coastline there will be an ongoing need to research the trends, influences, and histories that these places have. Understanding of the barrier beach environments is complex and multifaceted, yet many similar transitions and actions have occurred across different landscape gradients, scopes, and scales. The ability to adapt similar research practices to the coastal region, especially barrier beach environment, helps to enhance the understanding of coastal land cover change (CLCC). The prior three analytical chapters have created a new understanding of the ways in which these barrier beaches can be identified, understood, and studied. These research methods are not the only a means to look at this region, but a starting point to continue to build upon and to create better methods of analysis to further our understanding of these dynamic places. While the methods have been adapted from research on different landscapes, they reflect a truly coastal focus and understanding. Barrier beach typologies provides a synthesized understanding of a diverse composition of barrier beach communities involving social, spatial, natural environmental, and policy dimensions. The quantitative exploration of the factors that influence CLCC via regression modeling identifies the drivers that impact coastal developed change. The coastal restructuring model allows for more nuance and place-based interpretation of the trajectories transition of coastal land cover change that strictly quantitative approaches are not able to disentangle."}, {"section_title": "Barrier Beach Typology", "text": "The ever changing makeup of barrier beach communities reflects the convergence of human interaction along the coast. The linkages between demographic characteristics and land cover change are reflective of the shifting trends and patterns occurring on barrier beaches. Rooted in the idea of coastal getaways that is generated by society romanticized notion of the coastal region especially barrier beach communities. For the observed period (1990)(1991)(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000) this shifting trend of undeveloped barrier beaches evolving into amenity driven tourist destinations is reflective of occurrences occur in other regions such as the New West region in the U.S. which has experience similar change albeit in a different environmental context. While these amenity driven destinations appear in this research there is also the identification of the remnants of existing coastal communities that are not experience transitions to amenity oriented destinations. This The findings from this research reveal that there exists over the observed period a differentiation of barrier beach place types. It reveals that based on the variables explored that there is a difference between units. These differences change our understandings regarding barrier beaches communities and their homogeneity or heterogeneity in terms of socio-economic, environmental, and policy dimensions. The identified New and Old Atlantic place types are broad identifier names placed upon the two major barrier beach classifications within which subcategories are also identified via the typological classification methodology. These place types are indicative of varying shifts for these coupled natural human systems occurring over the observed time period. If the observed period were elongated back into history it is hypothesized that one would envision many of these New Atlantic units as undeveloped and many of the old Atlantic units being classified as New. The research starts the discourse into creating an understanding of the emerging trends with the time period. It is interesting to note that many of the same trends occurring at larger scales in the New West are happening at smaller scales along the Atlantic Coast. While these trends in land cover change to developed are occurring it leaves the question of how and what drives these changes on barrier beaches."}, {"section_title": "Drivers of Barrier Beach CLUCC", "text": "Understanding the influences of how barrier beaches developed land cover changes over time has challenged researchers due to the complex nature and multiple actors in the region. Approaches to understand the physical changes along the coast have been done by various researchers, but little has investigated the drivers of conversion to developed land use status explicitly for the narrow stretch of multiple places comprising the U.S. Atlantic barrier beach. Understanding people, nature and how the existing environment interacts, aids in explaining the process of conversion of barrier beach land cover to developed land use status. It is also noted that while each barrier beach is influenced individually by its surrounding forces there are a general set of forces that can explain change from undeveloped to developed land cover. While a holistic approach is necessary to account for all factors changing barrier beach land cover to developed it cannot be easily observed. It is in this understanding that drivers reflective of existing research that aids in forming a coastal understanding of actors of change. It is in this exploitation of the different drivers one would expect that socioeconomic drivers would play an important role in driving developed land cover change. This in fact was observed as false while many anthropogenic and natural drivers played a larger role in explaining change to developed land cover on barrier beaches. This reveals that at the regional scale, social indicators of change are not important factors in explaining change to developed land cover. This can be due in part to the cultural and political differences that exist across the region or for some factors unknown. This research evaluates selected drivers from research rooted in land cover change science as well as accepted theories about coastal research. The findings show that there is a strong connection between the selected drivers and change to developed land cover on these barrier beaches with an overall explanation of change from the full model being sixty seven percent. The largest contributor to this being total land area or overall size of the unit. This reveals that above all factors the larger the land area even if it is developed or not will have the largest influence on development change. This shows that there is a strong explanation from the selected drivers that exist when land changes to developed on barrier beaches. When working with the different individual regression models, both natural and spatial models provided a strong explanation of change to developed land cover. When looking at the spatial model, the roles of seasonal housing and spatial accessibility to population are the significant factors that explain change to developed land cover. The observed factors represented in this model suggest that conversion to developed land cover is driven to a large degree driven by tourist activities. The model incorporating only natural environmental variables reveals relative magnitude of areas in flood zones, erosion rate, and presence of wetlands to be significant. High levels of flood zone area and high erosion rate have positive significant influences on conversion to developed land use leading one to believe that development in coastal areas is being pushed into high risk regions. Wetlands represent a negative significance where the more wetlands existing in an area the less change to developed status exists. Interestingly, the social (Adjusted R-Square of 44.5%) and policy (Adjusted R-Square 1.7%) models , compared to other models, showed little overall influence on developed land cover change and had no statistically significant variables other than the control variable representing size of the beach places used as the unit of analysis. These results could be an issue of both scale and scope when observing the drivers that act upon barrier beaches. Scale could present a problem with this due in part to the fact that socioeconomic data is not exact based on the boundaries created by the research with some over accounting and undercounting of variables and there change over time. Scope could be factor that presents a problem with the research is present in the extent to which policy is analyzed within the research. Due to lack of method to provide better policy information across different levels of government as well as across states federal policy was the only examined variable for the research."}, {"section_title": "Coastal Restructuring Model for CLCC", "text": "History can provide us with an abundance of information about the past, but also has the propensity to provide glimpses into the future. The coastal restructuring model provides a theoretical framework tool for coastal planners and managers that allows for the transitional history of a barrier beach place to be interpreted in a way that accounts for more nuance place- it is really people that determine how much, how fast, and where development will occur."}, {"section_title": "Final Remarks", "text": "This research has created an understanding and characterization of the existing patterns and drivers of land use/cover change on barrier beaches. The knowledge gained from this research is focuses on aiding researches, planners, and policy makers in understanding the roles of development pressures, spatial accessibility, and policy on barrier beaches. The key to this is barrier beach component because many times scale and scope to which policies and plans are implemented overlook these narrow bars of sand. While pressures from both human and natural causes act upon these barrier beaches new information is created and new understandings of how these areas evolve and change over time are needed. With an increased understanding there can be more focus created on policy and plans that take into account these barrier beaches."}]
