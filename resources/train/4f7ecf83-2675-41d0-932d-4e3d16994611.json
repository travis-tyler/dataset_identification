[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Objectives: One of the hypothesized causes of the breakdown in sleep-wake consolidation often occurring in individuals with"}, {"section_title": "", "text": "N octurnal wakefulness and daytime napping often characterize the sleep-wake disturbance frequently associated with Alzheimer disease (AD). Previously, we longitudinally followed sleep-wake disturbances in AD participants and found significant nocturnal wake time after sleep onset (WASO). 1 We also found that sleep-wake deterioration in individuals with AD behaved as a \"trait\"; that is, decline was consistently manifested in some individuals, while others never manifested such decline over their illness course. 2 This led us to search for genetic variations to explain such \"traits.\" One hypothesized cause of this breakdown in sleep-wake consolidation is the degeneration of the circadian clock. 3 A limited number of genes likely underlie the core circadian oscillation found in neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the location of the circadian clock in mammals. 4 Variation within the small number of circadian genes could result in several relevant phenotypes becoming more prominent, as compensatory mechanisms are lost during the course of AD. The potential impact of human circadian genetic variation is suggested by recent studies showing that variation in the human CLOCK and per3 genes may be associated with differences in sleep-wake function. 5, 6 CLOCK and per3 proteins interact with other gene products in the basic circadian system (per1, per2, bmal-1, csnk1e, cry1, and cry2).\nUsing actigraphy, it is feasible to collect sleepwake phenotype data in large numbers of AD participants and to analyze their genotype data on candidate gene single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by using gene chip technology. This study reports actigraphy sleep-wake data collected from AD participants in relation to their circadian candidate gene polymorphisms."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "The analyses in this report were performed on two cohorts of AD participants. Cohort 1. Inclusion/exclusion criteria required a diagnosis of probable AD by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-AD and Related Disorders Association criteria 7 based on relevant neurologic, medical, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological assessments. Participants were excluded if they had active major medical conditions that would have precluded the collection of actigraphy data. The 124 participants in this cohort were from two sources: 1) 81 participants in an ongoing longitudinal study of AD at the Stanford/Veterans Affairs, National Institute on Aging (NIA) Alzheimer's Disease Core Center, and 2) 43 French participants from the Memory Disorders Clinic at the University of Nice School of Medicine that collaborated with our group on AD sleep studies. For this analysis, only white participants were selected from both sources, and participants in Cohort 1, as a whole, were 46% men. At the time of actigraphy, the average age of the 124 participants in ADNI was launched in 2003 by the NIA, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the Food and Drug Administration, private pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations, as a $60-million, 5-year public-private partnership. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, other biologic markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials.\nThe principal investigator of ADNI is Michael W. Weiner, M.D., VA Medical Center and University of California, San Francisco. ADNI is the result of efforts of many coinvestigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and participants have been recruited from more than 50 sites across the United States and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 adults, age 55-90 years, to participate in the research.\nThe ADNI participants were studied by using the same Illumina gene chip technology as that used for Cohort 1, described previously. They did not receive actigraphy but received the Neuropsychiatric Inventory questionnaire (NPI-Q), 9 which included sleep and other behavioral ratings.\nThe major reason for including the ADNI/NPI cohort was to provide additional data regarding the possibility that facets of behavior being described by the NPI-Q might be in any way affected by the selected SNPs in the same manner as the sleep data from Cohort 1. Thus, since both cohorts were measured on the same SNPs, we felt it worthwhile to provide all available data on behavioral correlates of these SNPs in one analysis.\nOnly white participants were selected from the ADNI database; the cohort was 55% men, and the average age was 75.6 years (SD: 7.6; range: 55-91 years). The mean Mini-Mental State Exam 8 score for the 176 participants in Cohort 2 at the time the NPI data were collected was 23.3 (SD: 2.0; range: 18 to 27).\nThe institutional review boards for human subjects research at all sites in the current analysis approved their respective research protocols. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant or legally authorized representative."}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": "Actigraphy. Rest/activity data were collected for Cohort 1 by means of a wrist-worn, watch-size ambulatory motion-detecting device, the actigraph (Ambulatory Monitoring Systems, Inc., Ardsley, NY). Participants were asked to wear an actigraph 24 hours a day on their nondominant wrists for seven consecutive days and were instructed to remove the device only for bathing or swimming. The actigraph was set to record motion in 30-second epochs.\nMeasures of nighttime sleep-wake behavior, in particular, WASO, were obtained by using the computer scoring program supplied by the manufacturer (ACTION software version 1.3, Ambulatory Monitoring Systems, Inc, Ardsley, NY). The ACTION software scores the actigraph recordings following the entry of participants' evening bedtimes and final morning out-of-bed times derived from daily sleep logs completed by the caregiver. The scores used in the data analyses were averages of the consecutive days of actigraphy; night-to-night variability was not examined in this article. Not all data were usable due to occasional technical failures of the device, and the amount of actigraph data collected varied across participants, depending on their compliance, but 84% of the participants had at least 4 or more days of data per recording session. The mean WASO for the 124 participants in Cohort 1 was 85 minutes (SD: 64; range: 5-414). The staff members in Nice, France, were trained for the use of actigraphy at Stanford, and they used the same device. Furthermore, all data collected in Nice were double checked by US staff, and both groups used the same diagnostic criteria for AD. An advantage of the actigraph as an outcome measure is that it is not language dependent.\nNeuropsychiatric Inventory. The NPI-Q is a brief, informant-completed questionnaire assessing the participant's neuropsychiatric symptoms and the caregiver's level of associated distress. The NPI-Q is designed to assess dementia patients' behaviors (delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, motor disturbance, nighttime behaviors, and appetite/eating) regarding their severity and distress to the caregiver during the past month.\nThe item relating to sleep-wake disturbance in nighttime behaviors on the NPI-Q was analyzed for the 176 AD participants in Cohort 2: \"Does the patient awaken you during the night, rise too early in the morning, or take excessive naps during the day? (Item K)\" On this item, 74% were scored as \"not a problem,\" 17% were \"mild,\" 7% were \"moderate\" and 2% were \"severe\" (see Table 1 , which shows the association tests between gene SNPs and NPI severity items). None of the measures used required translation (the NPI-Q reported here was administered to only the US-based ADNI cohort).

We utilized the Human 610 Quad gene chip (Illumina, Inc., Hayward, CA) that genotypes approximately 658,000 SNPs and has the same coverage as that used in ADNI. SNPs on all relevant circadian candidate genes were genotyped for both cohorts."}, {"section_title": "Additional Genotyping Procedures", "text": "The variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism in per3, where a 54-nucleotide coding region motif is repeated in four or five units, has been linked with multiple sleep phenotypic parameters. 6 This VNTR polymorphism could not be determined by using Illumina technology, so a separate procedure was performed in which the target hPer3 gene fragment was amplified by using sense "}, {"section_title": "Analytic Procedures", "text": "The analytic approach proceeded along the following steps. We first identified the SNPs available for analysis from the eight circadian candidate genes (CLOCK, per1, per2, per3, bmal-1, csnk1e, cry1, and Table 2 shows the association testing between the 122 candidate gene SNPs and the relevant sleepwake phenotype variable, WASO. None of the candidate gene SNPs or the VNTR polymorphism was significantly associated with WASO score after fullscan permutation. The full-scan permutation is a permutation test over the distribution of minima for the p values calculated in the full genome-wide scan for association provided by the Golden Helix Software. \"Full scan,\" as defined by Golden Helix, means that the software determines the minimal p value over the entire set of p values for the study, randomizing the phenotype with each resampling iteration. 11 The VNTR polymorphism appeared to be associated with one of the per3 SNPs in our sample (rs228729, see Table 3 ). This is a different SNP from that previously found (rs2640909) to be associated with the per3 VNTR in a Japanese sample. 12 These two SNPs are not well associated in white (r 2 = 0.117) or Japanese individuals (r 2 = 0.014) (SNP Annotation and Proxy Search, www.broadinstitute.org/ mpg/snap/ldsearch.php, based on HapMap release 22)."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "A similar analysis was also negative using the same SNPs in the 176 cases from the ADNI data set and their NPI measure of nighttime behavioral disturbance. Parenthetically, we found that there were no full-scan permutation-corrected significant correlations between the selected SNPs and any of the NPI severity measures (see Table 1 , which shows the association tests between gene SNPs and NPI severity items)."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The analysis conducted with 124 participants and 122 SNPs has greater than 80% power to detect a two-tailed correlation of 0.38 for any one of the 122 SNPs with WASO scores. Thus, we conclude that it is unlikely that a clinically relevant relationship (one with a \"medium\" effect size) 13 exists between these circadian rhythm-associated SNPs and WASO, our primary measure of nocturnal sleep disturbance, in individuals with AD, although this is based on a possible 20% false-negative rate. It is possible that there may be an association between these SNPs and sleep pathologies commonly found in this population (e.g., sleep-disordered breathing and restless legs syndrome), though this remains for future study. These results do not rule out the possibility that smaller correlations exist; however, correlations smaller than 0.38 would explain less than 14% of the variance of the clinical phenomena, hence may not be clinically relevant. The data in Table 2 may exist with some SNPs on cry1 or per3; however, none of these correlations at the level of less than 0.30 were significant after the full-scan permutation correction. Such smaller relationships may still be of theoretical interest to those examining basic physiologic relations of genetic measures and sleep-wake phenomena, even if they may not be clinically relevant. Exploratory analyses were also performed by using the ADNI data set and scores on other NPI items. In these analyses, no SNPs were significantly associated with any of the other NPI measures. We feel that it would be premature to draw any conclusions from these results other than to suggest the need for further examination of these relationships in other data sets to determine whether they are replicable.\nIn summary, we examined the genetic sources of variability in two independent samples of AD patients with different but complementary measures of sleep-wake disturbances. We did not find relationships that are likely to be of clinical relevance, even though the study was powered sufficiently to identify correlations of a moderate size. We conclude that sources of variation of neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD do not lie in simple relationships to specific SNPs associated with circadian rhythms but possibly depend on other physiologic mechanisms or interactions among a number of genetic markers."}]
