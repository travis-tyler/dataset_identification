[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS), and its contribution to sea level rise, are of high interest in the context of global warming. According to the latest IPCC report (2007), melting of the whole GrIS would contribute nearly 7m to sea level rise. Even a less substantial mass loss would have a strong impact on sea level rise. Over the last twenty years, observations of the GrIS show an acceleration of ice mass loss caused by rapid glacier flow on the southeast and northwest coasts (see Allison et al. (2009) and Zwally et al. (2011) for reviews), in response to the recent warming affecting both the atmosphere (Box and Cohen, 2006) and sea water (Hanna et al., 2009). Nevertheless, analysis of changes in the glaciers reveals a succession of periods of mass loss acceleration and deceleration. Since its launch in March 2002, the GRACE mission has demonstrated great potential for studying the ice sheet mass changes. The GRACE data have been increasingly used for assessing mass balance of Greenland and Antarctica. First studies revealed a significant mass loss of Greenland with an acceleration of melting starting in 2004 (Velicogna andWahr, 2005, 2006;Chen et al., 2006;Luthcke et al., 2006;Ramillien et al., 2006). Mass loss occurred mainly on the east coast of Greenland whereas the interior of the continent exhibited a small mass increase (Luthcke et al., 2006;Wouters et al., 2008). Recent studies showed acceleration of the mass loss during (Velicogna, 2009 and a deceleration during -2009(Chen et al., 2011. Nevertheless, the results obtained so far are highly dependent on the length of the GRACE time series, the chosen data set, the nature of the post-processing, and the method for computing linear trends (i.e., with or without adjusting the seasonal components). Results can vary by a factor \u223c3 depending on the data set (e.g. CSR, GFZ or JPL; Baur et al., 2009). From these previous GrIS mass balance estimates, linear trends were simply computed over the complete (or parts of the) period of availability of the GRACE data, assuming the ice melting to be constant in time. Only Velicogna (2009) and Rignot et al. (2011) estimated accelerations for 2004 and 2008-2009. In this study, we re-evaluate the Greenland mass balance over a longer time span (October 2002 -July 2010), using Level-2 GRACE data from the Science Data Centre 2 (UTCSR, GFZ and JPL) and different post-processing techniques (Gaussian and Independent Component Analysis-based approaches) at continental and ice field scales. We also analyze the interannual variability of the mass balance using the robust Seasonal Trend Decomposition by Loess (LOcally wEighted Scatterplot Smoothing) (STL) approach. The non-stationarity of the mass balance is then related to climate forcings from the atmosphere and the ocean through comparisons with snow depths (SD) and sea surface temperatures (SST)."}, {"section_title": "Data sets", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "GRACE-based water mass variations", "text": "Since its launch in March 2002, the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission, consisting of a pair of co-orbiting satellites at an altitude of 400-450 km, provides a systematic mapping of the spatio-temporal variations of the Earth's gravity field. These are estimated with an unprecedented precision of \u223c1cm in terms of geoid height (Tapley et al., 2004), or equivalently \u223c15-20 cm in equivalent-water thickness when averaged in regions of 300x300 of square kilometers (Ramillien et al., 2008;Schmidt et al., 2008). The Level-2 GRACE solutions consist of monthly Stokes coefficients (i.e., normalized spherical harmonics of the geo-potential) estimated by a leastsquares adjustment of GRACE orbit measurements -especially very accurate intersatellite K-Band Range (KBR) variations-made by different official providers [Ge-oForschungsZentrum (GFZ) in Potsdam Germany, Center of Space Research at University of Texas (UTCSR) in Austin, TX, Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, CA]. In this process, the Stokes coefficients are corrected for known atmospheric and oceanic gravitational contributions (Bettadpur , 2007), so that the residuals represent non-modeled phenomena, mainly variations in land water storage, glaciers, and ice sheet mass. These Level-2 GRACE solutions are available at: ftp://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/grace/ up to harmonic degree of 50-60 (i.e., spatial resolution of 333-400 km), and the corre- \u2022 grids of equivalent-water heights are also downloadable. In our study, we use monthly GFZ, UTCSR and JPL solutions from 04/2002 to 07/2010. The GRACE solutions suffer from the presence of an unrealistic high-frequency noise appearing as north-south striping, caused by orbit resonance during the Stokes coefficient determination and aliasing with short-term oceanic and atmospheric phenomena that are not well modeled. Several post-processing methods, such as low-pass Gaussian filtering, have been proposed to solve this problem (Jekeli, 1981;Swenson and Wahr, 2002). However most of them suffer from the risk of losing signal energy in the spectrum truncation (i.e., drastic loss of spatial resolution). This also needs arbitrary tuning of required parameters (e.g., a priori level of noise, cutting spatial frequencies,...) in absence of criteria. To get rid of the noise in the L-2 GRACE solutions, we preferred to use the global ICA estimates obtained by combination of GFZ/UTCSR/JPL solutions, to isolate statistically independent components of the observed gravity field, in particular the continental water storage contribution that we compared with continental water storage estimated from classical Gaussian-filtered solutions."}, {"section_title": "ICA solutions", "text": "A post-processing method based on ICA (Comon , 1994;De Lathauwer et al. , 2000) was applied to the Level-2 GRACE solutions prefiltered with Gaussian filters of 400 km and 500 km of radius. This so-called blind source separation (BSS) approach does not require a priori information, except the assumption of statistical independence of the elementary sources that compose the total measured signals. Taking into account the consideration that the GRACE Level-2 products from CSR, GFZ and JPL are different observations of the same monthly gravity anomaly, and that the land hydrology and the north-south stripes are the independent sources. Assuming that the observations y collected from N sensors are the combination of P (N \u2265 P ) independent sources represented by the source vector x, they can be written as a linear statistical model: where M is the mixing matrix whose elements dicate to what extent the jth source contributes to the ith observation. The columns {m j } are the mixing vectors. ICA aims at estimating the mixing matrix M and/or the corresponding realizations of the source vector x, only knowing the realizations of the observation vector y, under the following assumptions: i) the mixing vectors are linearly independent, and ii) the sources are statistically independent. The contributors to the observed gravity field are forced to be uncorrelated, numerically only considering completely objective constraints. The efficiency of ICA to separate gravity signals and noise from combined GRACE solutions has previously been demonstrated on Level-2 solutions over land (Frappart et al., 2010(Frappart et al., , 2011.

Because of its viscoelastic behavior, i.e. Post Glacial Rebound (PGR), the Earth's mantle is still continuing a non negligible isostatic re-adjustment (Peltier, 2004). As a consequence of this longterm deformation, the Earth's surface and gravity field are still affected by PGR at linear rates. For example, in the South of Hudson Bay in Canada, the uplift of the surface measured at GPS sites reaches 1.1 cm/yr (Sella et al., 2007). Knowledge of the deglaciation history and the Earth's mantle viscosity remains limited to uncertainties in PGR modeling. However, according to independent models, PGR geographicallyaveraged over Greenland shows negative trends weaker than 10 Gt/yr, and is considered by some authors to be weak compared to ice mass loss. Using different PGR models, comparable PGR estimates, from 7 or 8 Gt/yr were found (Velicogna and Wahr, 2006;Velicogna, 2009) considering the ICE-5G model of Peltier (2004), and up to 9 Gt/y (Ramillien et al., 2006) using the IJ-2005 model developed by Ivins and James (2005). As it is available at the GRACE Tellus website (http://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/data/pgr), we consider the Paulson et al. (2007)  Degree-one terms were omitted as they are not included in the GRACE solutions. The results were smoothed using a Gaussian averaging function of 400 and 500 km radius. Over the whole of Greenland, we found a PGR trend close to -8 Gt/yr, representing -4 mm/yr of equivalent-water height. For each time step the modeled PGR contribution has been removed from the filtered GRACE mass anomalies. When interpreting the PGR-corrected Greenland mass balance, we keep in mind that the PGR model uncertainty can represent an important source of error."}, {"section_title": "Seasonal-Trend Decomposition by Loess (STL) Method", "text": "The STL method, based on locally weighted regression (Cleveland et al., 1990), is a robust and computationally efficient approach commonly used to decompose time , and residual (R v ) components: The inner loop contains six steps.

In the third step the smoothed sub-cycle time series are processed using a low pass filter. The low pass filter is composed of three consecutive averaging means, followed by a locally weighted regression. The low . The estimated low pass filtered values of the seasonal sub-cycles are then removed from the smoothed sub-cycle time series of step 2 to receive the seasonal signal S k+1 v (step 4): In the next step (step 5), the original time series is reduced by the seasonal signal: In the last step (step 6) the reduced time serie from step 5 is smoothed by locally weighted regression with d = 1 to receive the updated trend signal T k+1 v . In the outer loop the trend and seasonal signal are used for computing the remaining signal R v : For each time step a robustness weight \u03c1 v is determined. Outliers will have a very small or zero weight. In the next run of the inner loop the robust weight will be multiplied to the weights \u03d1 v in the locally weighted regression in step 2 and 6. The Fortran-Code for the STL-Method has been provided at the following webpage: http://www.stat.purdue.edu/ wsc/localfitsoft.html. For an easy start into the method the function stlez.f has been used. In this function just the main necessary parameters have to be entered by the user: 1) The number of observations n p which are included in each period. We have time series with monthly resolution and an annual signal, choosing n p = 12 . 2) The number of iterations of the inner (n i ) and outer (n o ) loop. Because, that the convergence of estimating the different components of the signal is very fast, n i can be set to 1. If a robust estimation of the signals is preferred, the determination of the robust weight in the outer loop is done until the convergence criteria is reached, or with a maximum of n o = 15. 3) In step 2 the estimated seasonal signal is smoothed by Loess with the parameters d = 1 and q = n s . The seasonal signal becomes smoother with increasing n s . At minimum, n s has to be odd and greater than 6. Due to this fact n s = 7 has been chosen. 4) In step 3 the smoothing with Loess, with parameter d = 1 and q = n l , is applied. The weight factor n l has to been chosen as the least odd number equal to n p .

Figure 1 presents the six mean ice fields composing the Greenland ice sheet (acc. to Luthcke et al., 2006). The corresponding ICA-based time series were corrected for the seasonal signal by applying the STL decomposition (explained in paragraph 3.3). Velicogna (2009) proposed an additional filtering to cancel the long term and periodic contributions in the GRACE data, based on the least-square adjustment of annual, semi-annual, trend and constant terms using 13-month running windows. Instead of fitting empirical periodic variations, we preferred to apply the more robust STL method for extracting the long-term signals. To illustrate the benefit of using the STL decomposition, Fig. 2 "}, {"section_title": "compares the", "text": "Greenland mass balance based on the method developed here (STL, ICA), to classical Gaussian filtering. The decreasing behavior of these curves confirms the mass depletion of this ice sheet due to important melting during the GRACE period. Moreover, these GRACE-derived time series also contain annual and sub-annual signals that need to be isolated in order to extract the interannual ice mass variations. Differences between ICA and Gaussian filtered estimates are not always correlated for wavelengths less than 1 year, and they can reach 100 mm of equivalent-water height. These shortterm differences can be accounted for a reduction of the residual noise by ICA after the Gaussian low-pass filtering. Fig. 2b presents the STL-smoothed time series containing the interannual variations of GrIS ice mass, which are not a simple straight line, suggesting that GrIS ice mass loss cannot be represented by a constant slope. In the next sections, we attempt to explain the presence of such interannual variations by establishing correlations in time with climate forcings. Depending on the chosen period and time length, the linear trends computed along the time series are not constant. For example, there are obvious accelerations of ice melting (Velicogna and Wahr, 2006;Velicogna, 2009), and a relative deceleration in 2009-2010, in agreement with the results found by Rignot et al. (2011) for Greenland during the last years. The change of the GrIS mass balance for the complete GRACE period (i.e., between 2003 and 2010) still exhibits a huge mass loss, even before the constant negative rate of \u223c-8 Gt/yr for PGR is removed from the linear trend estimates. The amplitude of these trend estimates clearly varies with the GRACE solution provider (i.e., CSR, GFZ, JPL) and the post-processing (i.e., ICA or only Gaussian low-pass filtering). In terms of sensitivity relative to the GRACE solution source, the lowest values are systematically obtained with the JPL solutions. This is probably due to some specific pre-processings of the GRACE measurements made by this provider. Low linear trends were already found by Baur et al. (2009) using JPL solutions over Greenland while CSR solutions give values twice as large (see Table 1). Use of ICA instead of Gaussian filtering makes the GrIS ice mass time series smoother. Comparison with PGR-corrected GrIS ice mass loss estimates from previous studies leads to important differences (see Table 1 and Figure 3). These differences can be explained by the different time spans considered in this study and the high interannual variability of the GrIS ice mass change, as previously shown on the Fig.2a-b. We  2002-11/2009, 04/2002-03/2005, 04/2005-11/2009, using CSR solutions Gaussian filtered with a radius of 400 km, whereas Chen et al. (2011) found linear trends of respectively -219, -144, -248 Gt/yr over the same time periods using CSR solutions, after low-pass Gaussian filtering using a radius of 300 km and correcting of leakage and biases of GRACE. Our trend estimates using Gaussian-filtered solutions are slightly lower (i.e., around -80 Gt/yr), but remain consistent in amplitude with the results of previous works (e.g., Ramillien et al. (2006) "}, {"section_title": "Regional mass balances", "text": "Time series of the mass balance for different Greenland ice-field basins were computed using the geographical boundaries from Luthcke et al. (2006). They are presented on Fig. 5. If the whole GrIS exhibits a clear mass depletion over 2003-2010, the situation is more contrasted at regional scale. The highest mass loss occurs in the southeastern part of the continent with an average rate of -107 Gt/yr and -120 Gt/yr for ICA and Gaussian solutions respectively ( Fig. 3c, d, e). In general, mass depletion is larger in coastal regions than inside the continent due to a huge amount of ice lost by coastal glaciers along the south coast. Our regional estimates remain numerically comparable to the per-basin mascons values found by Luthcke et al. (2006) for the period 2003-2005, where the most significant mass loss occurs in the southeastern regions of Greenland (i.e., -71 Gt/yr). Once again, the difference with our estimates comes from the facts that: (i) the period of time we consider is longer (e.g., non-stationarity of the signals at inter-annual time-scales), and (ii) mascons solutions probably provides a smoother solution as it is based on spatial a priori constraints of a few hundreds of km (Rowlands et al., 2005)."}, {"section_title": "Comparison with simulated snow depth", "text": "To explain the interannual variations of the GrIS, comparisons between GRACEderived mass changes and simulated snow depth (SD) were achieved. Assuming that the horizontal displacements are low at the top of the ice fields (and then accelerate progressively down to the coast), and assuming that the mass balance depends only upon vertical mass fluxes (i.e. snow fall), we first computed correlation maps between the monthly mass anomalies from the different GRACE products and the monthly SD from ERA-interim over the period 2003-2010 ( Fig. 6). The results for CSR (ICA 400 km), CSR (GAUSS 400 km), GFZ (GAUSS 400 km), and JPL (GAUSS 400 km) are presented on Fig. 6a, b, c, and d respectively. We chose to only present the correlation map for that ICA CSR solution as the results obtained using GFZ and JPL solutions are very similar by construction (Frappart et al., 2010). High correlation coefficients (>0.7) are obtained over northern Greenland for the ICA, and CSR and GFZ Gaussian solutions, except in the northeastern part where ICA products exhibit negative correlation with snow depth. On the contrary, for the JPL Gaussian-filtered solutions high correlations are present only on the northwestern part of Greenland. For the southern part, CSR and JPL Gaussian solutions present medium to high correlation coefficients in the west, and negative correlations in the east, whereas GFZ Gaussian solutions exhibit negative correlations except over a small region in the center where correlations are low (0.3 to 0.4). The spatial pattern of the correlation between SD and for GRACE solutions is more consistent with other independent data sets for the ICA solutions. For these solutions, the greater correlations are found on the higher altitudes (>2000 or 2500 m) where the GrIS is nearly in balance due to small annual cycles and seasonal variations (Luthcke et al., 2006), and negative correlations are found at lower elevations where precipitation is increasingly rainfall rather than snowfall due to a rise of air temperatures (Krabill et al., 2000;Chylek et al., 2004;van den Broeke et al., 2009). In contrast, negative correlations are present mainly on the southwest coast, in the southeast, and in a small region in the northeast of Greenland. The time variations of the GrIS mass anomalies in these regions show that the mass decreases (2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008) or is balanced (2008)(2009)(2010), even when snow depth increases (see basin 3 to 5 in Fig. 7). These regions are covered with large glaciers, such as the Jacobshavn, Kangerlugssuaq and Helheim glaciers. The latter two have experienced an acceleration of their depletion rate in the recent years: acceleration in 2002-2003, deceleration in 2006, and acceleration in 2007(Howat et al., 2007Rignot et al., 2008). This spatial pattern is also in good accordance with modeled mass changes and discharge of the GrIS over 2003(van den Broeke et al., 2009, the anomalies of mean annual runoff (Hanna et al., 2005), air temperatures (Hanna et al., 2008), and melting days (Mote, 2007;Tedesco et al., 2011) during recent years: high correlations between SD and ICA solutions can be related to increasing mass, negative anomalies of temperatures and melting days, and vice versa. This result confirms that the mass balance of the GrIS is dominated by snowfall in regions of high elevation and by glacier discharge in regions of lower elevations."}, {"section_title": "Comparison with Sea Surface Temperature", "text": "The recently observed reduction of both extent and duration of winter sea-ice should cause an increase of snowmelt and glacier discharge due to an advection of warmer water from the ocean (Hanna et al., 2008). These observations coincide with a rapid succession of retreats and advances of the largest outlet glaciers (Luckman et al., 2006;Howat et al., 2007;Joughin et al., 2008;Moon and Joughin, 2008;Rignot et al., 2008) and suggest that Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and deeper ocean temperatures may have a strong impact on glacier dynamics (Hanna et al., 2009), especially when no strong correlation between air temperature and glacier dynamics was observed (Murray et al., 2010). We focus here on the largest glaciers, present in the south east of Greenland, in the region where snow depth change is not correlated with the mass change observations from GRACE (see Fig. 6 and basin 4 in Fig. 7). The mass variations derived from GRACE in this region were compared with SST along the south east coast of Greenland. Interannual trends of mass anomalies from GRACE and SST from NOAA are presented on Fig. 8 for several glaciers (further abbreviated with G1-G4, see Fig. 1) and locations in the Arctic Ocean (abbreviated with S1-S3). The interannual trends for south east Greenland present a decrease of the mass loss starting in 2006, consistent with the slow down and advance post-2005 of the glaciers' outlets, observed using multispectral and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images (Howat et al., 2008;Moon and Joughin, 2008;Murray et al., 2010). The mass loss over the 2003-2010 time period is larger for southern glaciers (-72\u00b11 mm/yr and -73\u00b12 mm/yr on average for ICA and Gaussian solutions respectively at point G4) than for northern ones (-41\u00b11 mm/yr and -44\u00b11 mm/yr in average for ICA and Gaussian solutions respectively at point G1). These results are in good agreement with estimates of surface mass balance models, which show that the largest variations of winter accumulation and runoff are located in the southeastern parts of Greenland (Murray et al., 2010). Comparisons of interannual mass changes and SST in the north show that an increase (respectively a decrease) of SST is followed by an acceleration (respectively a deceleration) of the mass change, whereas a decrease (respectively an increase) of SST in the south is followed by an deceleration (respectively an acceleration) of mass change. Larger correlations are found for northern ocean points. It seems that glacier mass variations are strongly influenced by seasonal northern SST changes (succession of positive and negative temperature events) with a time lag of 120 to 240 days and impact the SST in the south of Greenland, close to Fram Strait. This suggests that warming/cooling phases of coastal oceanic currents can cause dynamic glacier change, as a negative feedback between glaciers and the East Greenland Coastal Current (EGCC) evoked by Murray et al. (2010)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Our study presents a re-evaluation of the mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet using the Level-2 GRACE solutions over the period October 2002-July 2010 and using two post-processing methods to reduce noise and estimate trends. If our results corroborate what was found previously for shorter time spans, the most recent observations show, for the very first time since the launch of the GRACE mission, a decrease in mass loss of the GrIS for all the considered sources (UTCSR, GFZ, and JPL) and several filtering methods (Gaussian and Gaussian + ICA for averaging radii of 300, 400, and 500 km). The methodology, based on the combination of a Gaussian filter and an ICA approaches, reduces contamination by the spurious north-south stripes, and provides mass change rates more consistent with each other than classical filtering techniques. The decrease of GrIS ice mass is clearly not constant in time, but contains interannual variability suggesting that the ice mass melting is a transitional complex phenomenon. In terms of methodology, we therefore remain very critical about simply fitting a simple straight line to a set of points that contains different levels of noise. There are important implications in understanding the causes of an observed continuous sea level change. If the mass contribution of the ice sheets melting to sea level is not constant at interannual time scales, and less than previously expected, this means a larger steric (i.e., thermal) contribution in response of global warming.
