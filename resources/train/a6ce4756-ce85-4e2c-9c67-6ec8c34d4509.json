[{"section_title": "", "text": "The development of social and behavioral problems in children is often considered the result of complex interactions between a child and his or her caregivers within natural environments (i.e., school, home). Prior to school entry, children's socialization experiences occur primarily within the family. Within the familial context, behaviors become reinforced through reciprocal parent-child interactional patterns. Patterns that include negative parental behaviors-such as maternal negativity, harsh and inconsistent discipline, and lack of sensitivity and responsiveness-give rise to the early expression of behavior problems (Hill, 2002; Hinshaw & Lee, 2003; Loeber & Dishion, 1983; Patterson, 1982; Patterson, Reid, & Dishion, 1992; Shaw, Gilliom, Ingoldsby, & Nagin, 2003; Shaw & Winslow, 1997) . Additional family characteristics, including socioeconomic status (SES), are known to play a role in the development of behavior problems (Dodge, Pettit, & Bates, 1994; Hill, 2002; Miech, Essex, & Goldsmith, 2001 ) possibly because they may limit access to resources (such as high-quality early childhood education, pediatric care) that promote healthy child adjustment (Bradley & Corwyn, 2002) . However, the degree to which children's social-behavioral development and parenting practices are predicted by other contextual variables that may also limit access to health-promoting resources, such as community size or locale, has not been explored.\nCommunity settings within which children develop are characterized by a host of variables that may influence the demonstration of prosocial behaviors and their negative counterparts (e.g., disruptive, externalizing behaviors). Approximately 20% of the nation's children reside in rural communities (Strange, Johnson, Showalter, & Klein, 2012) , yielding a potentially significant effect on social-emotional development. On the one hand, close community networks and generally safe neighborhoods characteristic of rural settings may support stability in social relationships. On the other hand, agencies in rural communities (including schools) are often ill equipped with inadequate resources, underqualified staff, and poor facilities (Gamm, Stone, & Pittman, 2003; Holzer, Goldsmith, & Ciarlo, 1998; Jerald, 2002) . Isolation, small population bases, and limited revenue create barriers, including lack of availability of and access to specialized services and ongoing support (Fortney, Owen, & Clothier, 1999; Monk, 2007) , lack of anonymity and trust (Hartley, Korsen, Bird, & Agger, 1998; Owens, Richerson, Murphy, Jageleweski, & Rossi, 2007) , underidentification of problems (Girio-Herrera, Owens, & Langberg, 2013) , and fear of stigmatization (Susman, Crabtree, & Essink, 1995) . Schools and other agencies in rural communities tend to be hard to staff, with high turnover and a high percentage of inexperienced or poorly prepared teachers and mental health providers (Gamm et al., 2003; Monk, 2007) .\nSocial-behavioral problems and mental health needs of rural children often are overshadowed by discussions of problems in urban areas (Atav & Spencer, 2002; Herzog & Pittman, 1995) , likely because of the higher visibility of urban schools and communities as well as concentrated populations of schoolchildren in large cities. However, both internalizing and externalizing problems are prevalent among children in rural America. Using the National Survey of Children with Health Care Needs, Lenardson, Ziller, Lambert, Race, and Yousefian (2010) reported that a greater proportion of children living in rural areas have a mental health problem compared to children in urban settings. Furthermore, a greater proportion of rural children with mental health problems demonstrate behavioral difficulties relative to their urban counterparts. However, rural communities experience significant disparities in services equipped to treat children with social-behavioral problems (Lenardson et al., 2010) .\nCommunity context and its relationship to children's social-behavioral challenges has been the focus of a handful of studies. Research with young children entering kindergarten found that teachers in rural classrooms reported higher overall adjustment problems among their students relative to those in urban or suburban communities (Rimm-Kaufman, Pianta, & Cox, 2000) . Hope, Bierman, and The Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group (1998) found that compared to urban children, those in rural settings were significantly more likely to exhibit patterns of conduct problems at home only. In the school setting, differences in the nature of behavior problems surfaced: Rural children demonstrated essentially equal levels of externalizing, internalizing, and comorbid behavior patterns, whereas urban children experienced greater levels of externalizing behaviors than other problem types. 1 Although general descriptive information about social and behavioral patterns among children in rural and urban contexts is available, processes that may account for differences across rural and urban sites are unknown. The finding that rural children showed behavior problems at home only (Hope et al., 1998) suggests that different processes may be at play in the home but not school settings across these contexts. Similarly, Miller and VotrubaDrzal (2013) reported that children from rural areas entered kindergarten with less advanced academic skills than those from small urban and suburban settings, explained in part by less advantageous home environments (i.e., less warmth and responsive parenting, less parental knowledge about child development, and lower parental academic expectations).\nParents control the early home environments within which children develop, and interactions among children and adults in the immediate environment (i.e., microsystem) influence children's social and behavioral development in a significant way (Bronfenbrenner, 1979 ). Thus, it is possible that parent-child interactions unique to the rural setting are responsible in part for differences in the manifestation of behaviors across distinct geographic contexts. However, very little is known about parenting practices among families living in rural communities and whether or how they differ from those of parents in other geographic contexts (e.g., city, suburban, town). In addition, little is known about how parenting and parent-child interaction patterns influence the social-behavioral outcomes of children in rural versus city, suburban, and town settings. An understanding of the role of parenting within various geographic locales on children's development may go far in detecting risk factors in early parent-child interaction patterns. Because parenting practices are malleable, early parenting interventions can then become the focus of prevention efforts aimed at circumventing the development of social-behavioral difficulties and establishing positive adaptive outcomes for rural children."}, {"section_title": "Purpose of the Study and Research Questions", "text": "The purposes of the present study were multifold. First, we hoped to determine, with a large and nationally representative sample, whether geographic setting (rural vs. city, suburban, and town) influences the development of children's social-behavioral skills as manifested in kindergarten. Rural communities represent a significantly vast array of features that vary on a number of important dimensions, including cultural and economic diversity, density, remoteness, and stability, and studies with broad representation of rural communities are necessary.\nSecond, given the relevance of early home experiences for the development of social and behavioral skills, differences in parenting practices of parents in rural versus city, suburban, and town contexts was of interest. Finally, very little is known about how preschool parenting practices operate within various geographic settings to predict children's social and behavioral skills in kindergarten. Thus, the present study sought to determine whether parenting practices mediate the relationship between geographic setting and children's social-behavioral skills in kindergarten, as reported by both parents and teachers.\nOur research questions were as follows:\n1. Does living in a rural community context (vs. city, suburban, or town) influence children's social-behavioral skills (i.e., social skills, externalizing behaviors) in kindergarten?\n2. Does living in a rural community context (vs. city, suburban, or town) influence parents' affective behaviors (i.e., emotional supportiveness, negative regard, intrusiveness, detachment) during preschool? 3. Do parents' affective behaviors (i.e., emotional supportiveness, negative regard, intrusiveness, detachment) during preschool mediate the relationship between geographic setting (i.e., rural, city, suburban, town) and social-behavioral skills (i.e., social skills, externalizing behaviors) in kindergarten?"}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Source and Participant Characteristics", "text": "Data were drawn from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth cohort (ECLS-B) restricted datafile, which includes information about 10,700 children 2 born in the United States in 2001 and their parents, early child care providers, and kindergarten teachers. Data were collected across five waves: when the children were approximately 9 months of age (Wave 1), 2 years of age (Wave 2), preschool age (Wave 3), and kindergarten age (Waves 4 and 5; Snow et al., 2009) . The additional wave of kindergarten data collection was necessary to obtain information about children who were not yet in kindergarten in 2006 (approximately 24% of the total sample) or who repeated kindergarten in 2007 (approximately 3% of the total sample). All children were assessed at Wave 4, but only repeaters and children first entering kindergarten in 2007 were assessed at Wave 5.\nA stratified, clustered, systematic sampling method involving unequal selection probabilities was used to obtain a nationally representative sample of children born in the United States in 2001 (Snow et al., 2009) . Certain groups, including twins, Chinese, other Asians and Pacific Islanders, American Indians/Native Alaskans, and low birthweight children, were oversampled to ensure precision of parameter estimates. More information regarding the ECLS-B sampling design can be obtained from Bethel, Green, Nord, and Kalton (2005) .\nThe present study utilized data collected during the preschool (Wave 3) and kindergarten (Waves 4 and 5) waves (Snow et al., 2009) . Waves 4 and 5 were combined into a single kindergarten wave to allow for inferences about children's social-behavioral skills in kindergarten. Data were drawn from Wave 4 for children initially entering kindergarten in 2006 and from Wave 5 for children initially entering kindergarten in 2007. Taking into account the attrition that occurred during the data collection phase as well as sample restrictions made during the analytic phase, 3 the effective sample size for the present study was 6,550 children.

The\nTwo Bags Task consisted of a 10-min semistructured interaction between a parent and child in which the dyad was instructed to play with the contents of two bags. The first bag contained the book Corduroy (Freeman, 1968) and the second bag contained Play-Doh and related materials. All interactions were recorded, and the recordings were subsequently observed by trained certified coders who rated parents and children on several global scales originally developed by Fauth, Brady-Smith, and Brooks-Gunn (2003) for scoring the Three Bags Task and modifications of the task. Each scale was based on a 7-point coding system ranging from 1 = very low to 7 = very high.\nFour scales were used in the present study to define parents' affective behaviors directed toward their preschool child. The Parental Emotional Supportiveness rating scale evaluated the \"parent's emotional availability and physical and affective presence during the task\" (Snow et al., 2007, p. 71) . The Parental Negative Regard rating scale evaluated the \"parent's expression of discontent with, anger toward, disapproval of, or rejection of the child\" (p. 71). The Parental Intrusiveness rating scale evaluated the \"degree to which the parent controls the child rather than recognizes and respects the validity of the child's perspective\" (p. 71). Finally, the Parental Detachment rating scale evaluated the \"parent's\n[lack of] awareness of, attention to, and engagement with the child\" (p. 72). Based on the sample used in the present study, the weighted average scores were 4.42 (SD = 0.92, range = 1-7) for emotional supportiveness, 1.19 (SD = 0.51, range = 1-6) for negative regard, 1.53\n(SD = 0.87, range = 1-6) for intrusiveness, and 1.31 (SD = 0.69, range = 1-7) for detachment.\nHigher scores indicate more emotional supportiveness, negative regard, intrusiveness, and detachment.\nTo ensure the reliability of the Two Bags Task scores, field coders were first required to demonstrate 80% agreement (within 1 point) on five cases double coded by \"standard,\" or expert, coders (Najarian et al., 2010) . Then field coders were required to maintain 85% agreement on each parent/child scale for each 2-week period in which 20% of their tapes were double coded by a standard coder. Ratings of coders who did not meet this criterion were discarded, and the interactions were recoded by a new group of trained and certified coders.\nWeighted Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated among all Two Bags Task scale scores, which included ratings of both parent and child behaviors. Results provided validity evidence for the parent emotional supportiveness, negative regard, intrusiveness, and detachment scores. For the present sample, all correlations were in the expected directions (e.g., positive parent behaviors were positively associated with other positive parent and child behaviors and negatively associated with negative parent and child behaviors).\nAdditional information regarding the quality control, reliability, and validity of the Two Bags Task is provided in the ECLS-B preschool-kindergarten 2007 psychometric report (Najarian et al., 2010) ."}, {"section_title": "Child and Family Covariates", "text": "Parent-reported child race/ethnicity and gender, child exposure to outside care (parentonly vs. outside care) at the preschool wave, child age at the kindergarten wave, and family SES at the preschool wave were used as covariates in the study.

Our findings indicated that children's social skills (e.g., demonstrating their empathy for others, likability, expression of emotions) as measured by parent and teacher report were equivalent regardless of setting.\nHowever, parents in rural settings reported higher levels of externalizing behaviors (e.g., aggression, impulsivity) in their children than parents of children in city and suburban communities did for theirs. This finding was observed even after we controlled for children's race, ethnicity, age, gender, and exposure to outside care and family SES. No differences in behaviors across geographic context were reported by kindergarten teachers, suggesting that teachers view children as behaving similarly regardless of whether they reside in city, suburban, rural, or town settings. Understanding rural parents' perceptions is important given their role in providing structure, discipline, and reinforcement in response to children's behaviors. Relative to peers in other geographic contexts (i.e., city and suburban), parents of children living in rural settings report that their child may enter school lacking foundational behavioral skills necessary for early school success.\nExplanations for differences between rural parents' and teachers' ratings are not entirely clear. It is possible that parents have fewer opportunities than teachers to observe children other than their own and develop a notion of normative levels of externalizing behavior.\nOur research corroborates previous findings acknowledging that parents and teachers tend to rate behaviors differently (Achenbach, McConaughy, & Howell, 1987) , with parents generally perceiving their children's behaviors in a more negative light than teachers (Touliatos & Lindholm, 1981; Youngstrom, Loeber, & Stouthamer-Loeber, 2000) . Indeed, parents and teachers may rate similar behaviors differently based on their use of different vantage points and personal definitions of acceptability. However, it is possible that rural children's behaviors differ at home and at school. That is, the manifestation of behavior problems is often considered context and respondent specific (Achenbach et al., 1987; McCombs Thomas, Forehand, Armistead, Wierson, & Fauber, 1990) ; therefore, assessments that occur across settings and respondents yield more nuanced and comprehensive understandings of child behaviors. It is also worthy to note that the differences in children's externalizing behaviors and social skills as rated by parents and teachers may be related to differences in sample size or items measuring the outcomes. Specifically, teacherreport data were available only for a subset of cases used in the analyses, and fewer items were administered to teachers in the social-behavioral battery. Thus, the teacher-report items may have reflected a more limited representation of children's social skills and externalizing behaviors."}, {"section_title": "Rural Parents' Affective Behaviors", "text": "We also evaluated the impact of community context on parents' emotional supportiveness, negative regard, intrusiveness, and detachment when children were in preschool.

Specifically, rural parents exhibited less emotional support at the preschool assessment compared to city and suburban parents. These findings are consistent with those of Miller and VotrubaDrzal (2013) , who found contextual (i.e., setting) differences in parenting behavior: Specifically, rural parents displayed less positive parenting and cognitive stimulation at home compared to parents in other contexts. However, our findings did not indicate contextually based differences for parents' negative regard, intrusiveness, or detachment. It may be that rural parents, although not overtly negative, may exhibit less warm, sensitive, and supportive qualities that typically define certain constructions of positive parenting. It is possible, for instance, that rural parents focus more on fostering children's cognitive development or managing children's behaviors than the social-emotional component of parenting."}, {"section_title": "The Relationship Between Parents' Affective Behaviors and Children's Social-Behavioral Functioning", "text": "Although we did not see an overall difference in social skills between rural and city, suburban, and town settings, our analyses demonstrated that geographic setting indirectly affected children's parent-reported social skills through parents' emotional supportiveness. Specifically, rural parents demonstrated less emotional support than their city and suburban peers, and parents who provided less emotional support (i.e., appeared less available to their child or seemingly disengaged during parent-child interaction) reported that their children exhibited lower social skills in kindergarten, which resulted in indirect differences between rural and city and suburban children's reported social skills. Considering that interactions with parents may represent the most frequent and prevalent social exchanges available to rural children given the small community and sparse population base in rural settings, the importance of parental emotional support in children's developing social skills is evident.\nOur findings add to extant literature suggesting that parental emotional support impacts rural children's behaviors across different developmental stages. For instance, parental emotional support has also been shown to have an indirect, negative association with rural adolescents' aggressive behaviors (Larsen & Dehle, 2007) . Consistent with findings in the general population (e.g., Baker, Fenning, & Crnic, 2011; Berlin & Cassidy, 2003; Guralnick, Neville, Connor, & Hammond, 2003; Jones, Eisenberg, Fabes, & MacKinnon, 2002 ), it appears that greater emotional support displayed by rural parents serves as a protective factor for rural youth in early childhood and adolescence. Thus, social skills interventions designed and applied in rural communities may benefit from an emphasis on developing and promoting the use of parental emotional support, such as responding to children's emotional cues, following the child's lead, asking open-ended questions, and communicating positive regard (e.g., Knoche et al., 2012) .\nThe fact that there were no overall differences in social skills across settings despite rural children being indirectly disadvantaged by receiving less parent emotional support suggests that other factors in addition to parent emotional support should be considered in future research. More specifically, factors that serve to enhance children's social skill development in rural settings need to be considered, as they appear to buffer against the effects of lower emotional support in the home context. Again, these findings highlight the importance of examining children's social-behavioral development from an ecological perspective that considers systemic influences that may be unique to rural settings. For example, community connectedness or social organization has been shown to influence cognitive development differentially for children in rural and urban settings (Froiland, 2011) . Community connectedness may also play a unique role in the social development of young children in rural contexts and should be considered.\nWe also found that parental emotional support did not mediate the relationship between setting and child externalizing behaviors as measured in kindergarten. The observed mediating effect of parental emotional supportiveness on the relationship between setting and social skills only, and not externalizing behaviors, may be explained by social learning theory (Bandura, 1977) . Specifically, in providing emotional support, parents model positive social behaviors for children. Parents who display greater emotional support create opportunities for children to experience positive social interactions and practice social skills. Moreover, emotionally supportive parent-child interactions may be naturally reinforcing, leading children to engage with their parent more often using positive social skills.\nAlthough not identified as mediating factors in the associations between setting and child behavioral or social skill outcomes, certain parental affective behaviors were found to be predictive of child outcomes as reported by both parents and teachers. Parental intrusiveness in preschool was found to have a significant positive and predictive relationship with parent-and teacher-reported kindergarten externalizing behaviors and a significant negative relationship with teacher-reported social skills when children were in kindergarten. Furthermore, parental detachment and negative regard in preschool were also significant predictors of kindergarten teachers' reports of children's externalizing behaviors. These findings were not unique to rural children, and they collectively reinforce decades of research on the predictive relationship between negative styles of parenting and behavioral problems in children (Patterson et al., 1992) ."}, {"section_title": "Implications", "text": "Together, our findings highlight important differences in children's social-behavioral functioning in rural settings compared to other geographic settings. In particular, the increased prevalence of parents' perceptions of externalizing issues in children in rural communities compared to other contexts has implications for early school readiness. Externalizing issues such as aggression and impulsivity preclude children's engagement in the learning process and are associated with long-term deficits in academic achievement (Lane et al., 2008; Nelson et al., 2004; Reid et al., 2004) . Moreover, families living in rural communities often lack access to high-quality supports for managing behavioral issues (DeLeon, Wakefield, & Hagglund, 2003) . This compounded risk (i.e., parents' reports of increased externalizing issues and possible lack of behavioral supports) highlights the need to identify important variables impacting children's social-behavioral development in rural contexts and bolster both the quantity and quality of supports available to rural families in order to ameliorate these issues.\nThe relative differences in emotional support across geographic settings observed in our study are also of note. Although group comparisons did not reveal differences in children's social functioning, our findings suggested that rural parents exhibited less emotional supportiveness relative to parents in city and suburban settings. Pinderhughes, Nix, Foster, and Jones (2001) found some evidence to suggest that lower levels of child behavior problems were related to greater parental warmth in urban and rural families. It is possible that greater rates of externalizing issues reported for rural children in our study were evident by preschool and thereby had a negative effect on the amount of emotional support provided by rural parents. It is also possible that other factors in rural communities uniquely influence the social-behavioral functioning of children in rural settings, and these factors warrant further attention to support optimal functioning and development among young rural children."}, {"section_title": "Limitations and Future Directions", "text": "It is important to note study limitations in light of our findings. First, limited variability was evident for the parent negative regard, intrusiveness, and detachment scales. In general, low levels of negative parental affective behaviors were displayed by parents across the entire sample. This is often to be expected in direct observations of parent behaviors, as parents refrain from negative behaviors when observed. Second, global criteria were used to classify families as residing in city, suburban, town, or rural settings. Characteristics of rurality vary significantly from one rural community to another and across regions of the United States. Although the use of a nationally representative sample increased the generalizability of our results, the grouping of all families characterized as living in rural contexts prevented us from accounting for intragroup differences within rural communities across diverse regions in the nation. This limitation may also explain why no significant differences were seen in rural and town comparisons. It is possible that the global geographic definitions do not account for unique differences between these groups and that more sensitive qualifiers identifying phenomena unique to these communities may yield different results. Third, items across the parent and teacher social and behavioral scales were not identical, such that the ratings varied not only by source but also by content. Although our intent was not to compare ratings made by parents versus teachers, the differences across scales make conclusions regarding the parent and teacher ratings difficult to interpret in a collective sense.\nFuture investigation is necessary to identify other aspects of parenting and contextual influences that may explain the higher rates of externalizing behaviors reported for rural children in kindergarten compared to their city and suburban peers. Although we were unable to examine parents' disciplinary practices in natural contexts, this may be a direction worthy of future study (Bornstein et al., 2008) . Additional research is also warranted to investigate potential contextually based influences in children's internalizing behaviors.\nThough differences in internalizing behaviors across settings are plausible, our investiga-tion focused solely on externalizing behaviors because of the limited number of internalizing items included in ECLS-B parent and teacher interviews, as well as previous research demonstrating the low reliability and construct validity of these items (Rispoli et al., 2013; Roisman & Fraley, 2012) . Future research should also attempt to pinpoint reasons for which parental emotional supportiveness was lower in rural parents compared to other parents and whether this finding stands when one is accounting for other factors such as neighborhood safety and social support. Previous research suggests that contextual differences may be masked by the greater influence of these other factors in higher risk communities where lower levels of safety, support, and parental education prevail (Pinderhughes et al., 2001 ).\nAcknowledgments -This study was supported by Institute of Education Sciences Grant No. R305C090022, awarded to Susan M.

Children who were home schooled, who were in an ungraded program, who skipped kindergarten, or whose grade was unknown were omitted from the analyses. In addition, children reported as Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, non-Hispanic, were omitted from the analyses because of the group's small sample size, which resulted in nonconvergence when child race/ethnicity was included as a covariate.\n4. The weighted sequential hot deck method imputes data for missing responses by substituting information from similarly responding cases. Weighting ensures that the resulting means are equal to the expected value of the nonimputed data (Cox, 1980) . 5. Because the Research Question 2 pathways do not involve teacher-report outcomes, the pathways estimated via the teacher model are not discussed here (but all results are presented in table 5). Any differences in the Research Question 2 results between the parent and teacher models are merely due to differences in sample size."}]
