[{"section_title": "", "text": "lending is associated with farmland loss, such that the number of African American farmers in the United States has been falling at a much higher rate than that of White farmers. This community-based participatory research (CBPR) study sought to give voice to the experiences and perceptions of a small group of African American farmers in northeastern North Carolina. Researchers used Photovoice, a qualitative CBPR methodology, to identify strengths, concerns, and action steps in regards to farming and farmland loss in the community. This study revealed positive protective factors associated with farming, and long-lasting negative economic and psychological effects of discriminatory lending. Protective factors include increased self-reliance, strong work ethic, and hope for a new generation of African American farmers. Institutional discrimination remains a reported risk factor against maintaining generational family farming activities. Study participants reported a fear of further loss of the African American farming heritage as they perceive youth being deterred from the profession"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "African American farmers are historically important contributors to agriculture in the United States. In the era of slavery, White landowners sought the expertise of African slave farmers to improve crop cultivation, production, and animal husbandry (Hinson & Robinson, 2008) . After the Civil War the number of African American farmers proliferated, peaking in 1920, when nearly 926,000 individuals worked farms. In that era of small-scale farming there was approximately one African American farmer for every six White farmers in the country (Wood & Gilbert, 2000) . After 1920, the number of African American farmers decreased, and at a much faster rate than farmers in other demographic groups (Wood & Gilbert, 2000) . The 2007 Census of Agriculture counted 41,024 African American farmers, equivalent to 1 in 80 farmers (U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA], 2009a). Wood and Gilbert (2000) report that 15 southern states experienced the greatest decline in African American-owned farms, with a 45% reduction between 1982 and 1997. Among these, North Carolina experienced the greatest loss at 66%.\nOn average, approximately the same percentage of African American farmers and the national average of all farmers combined currently report farming as their primary occupation (44% and 45%, respectively), but African American farmers have less land (an average of 104 vs. 418 acres) and receive less in sales (US$21,340 vs. US$134,807) (USDA, 2009a) . African American farmers are older, on average, than farmers of other ethnic and racial groups. A greater proportion of African American farmers are 65 years or older compared to the national average for all farmers (37% and 30%, respectively), and the average age of the African American farmer (60.3 years) is higher than the overall average (57.1 years) (USDA, 2009a) .\nSpecifically in North Carolina, as of the 2007 Census of Agriculture, there were 1,837 African Americans farmers operating 1,595 farms, and 1,447 African American farm owners who owned an average of 60 acres (USDA-NASS, 2011a). Comparatively, there were 72,716 White farmers operating 50,897 farms, and 47,874 White farm owners who owned an average of 100 acres (USDA-NASS, 2011a) . From 1992 to 1997, African American farmers experienced a greater decline in the number of farmland owners (-19% vs. -3%) and a decrease in the amount of acreage owned (-9% vs. +4%) as compared to White farmers (USDA, 2009b) . This decrease in African American land ownership, whether reflecting outright loss of farms or loss in acreage, interferes with the viability of African American farmers. Land is a form of wealth that can be used for economic development, broader investment, and has been associated with higher educational achievement in children (Gilbert, Sharp, & Felin, 2002) .\nA number of factors contribute to the rapid and continual decline of farmland owned by African Americans. The initial decrease in African American-operated farms is attributed to increased farm mechanization and the end of the sharecropping system (Wood & Gilbert, 2000) . Recent factors associated with the decline in the number of African American farmers are argued to be not the result of economic trends alone, and to include: structural changes by U.S. agriculture favoring large farms, cumbersome tax laws, mortgage foreclosures, intestate death of landowners in the absence of a will and the resulting partition sales, and discrimination (Brown, Christy & Gebremedhin, 1994; Gilbert, Sharp, & Felin, 2002; Hinson & Robinson, 2008) . Discriminatory lending practices on the part of the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) included not providing African American farmers with access to credit, granting less credit to African American farmers than White farmers, and distributing loans to African American farmers too late in the farming season for maximized farming production (Gilbert, Sharp, & Felin, 2002; Hinson & Robinson, 2008) .\nThe negative effects of discrimination by race are broad and far-reaching. Racism negatively influences physical health, mental health, and socioeconomic opportunities (Jones, 2000; Paradies, 2006; Brondolo, Brady ver Halen, Pencille, Beatty, & Contrada, 2009 ). The association of race and socioeconomic factors is rooted in historic events that persist in contemporary institutional structures (Jones, 2000) . Institutional racism, defined as the organization and promotion of racial inequity through processes and structures, has a generational impact (Jones, 1997) . The historical discrimination practiced by the USDA is an example of institutional racism.\nIn response to discriminatory practices, African American farmers throughout the country filed grievances against the USDA. An eventual classaction lawsuit led by plaintiff Timothy Pigford of North Carolina reached the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia with then-U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman as the defendant. The court decided in favor of the farmers and the resulting multibillion dollar settlement from Pigford v. Glickman was the largest civil rights settlement in U.S. history (Hinson & Robinson, 2008) . A USDAcommissioned investigation into these discriminatory practices also led to the Civil Rights Task Force recommending 92 changes to address racial bias as a part of the USDA Civil Rights Action Plan (Cowan & Feder, 2010) . Since the Pigford v. Glickman ruling, the USDA has broadened outreach efforts to African American farmers through the establishment of the Office of Minority and Socially Disadvantaged Farmers Assistance, which includes the Minority Farm Register to promote equal access to USDA farm programs (USDA-FSA, 2007 ) and a grants program (USDA, 2003) . The USDA Small Farmers Outreach Training and Technical Assistance program in particular is a highlighted effort resulting in an increase in the number of African American farmers (Gilbert, Sharp, & Felin, 2002) . At the state level, the North Carolina Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services (NCDA&CS, 2011) instituted the Small Farms Ag Policy to provide outreach and education to minority and traditionally underserved farmers.\nIn the wake of the Pigford settlement, plaintiffs seeking restitution found the procedures overly burdensome, including the requirement to obtain records from a similarly situated White farmer to provide evidence of preferential treatment (Hinson & Robinson, 2008) . Many also found the time period allotted for claims submissions too short to produce the \"evidence of discrimination\" required. (Cowan & Feder, 2010) .\nDespite USDA discrimination on African American farmers cited in the literature above, and the resulting reparations and programs, a more recent study in Georgia found no evidence of discrimination on nonwhite borrowers based on the probability of a Farm Service Agency (FSA) loan application's approval (Escalante, Brooks, Epperson, & Stegelin, 2006) . Lending criteria has included subjective \"risk stereotypes,\" however, and the FSA loan review board comprises locally elected farmers who are generally White, with a few exceptions (Havard, 2001 ). This present preliminary study sought to give voice to the individual and community experiences of African American farmers in rural North Carolina, to shed light on their experiences and perceptions of discrimination, as well as their hopes for the future of African American farming in the region."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR) were used in this study (Israel, Schulz, Parker, & Becker, 1998) . One aspect of CBPR includes blurring the distinction between researcher and participant by creating a coresearcher relationship among all members, thereby minimizing power dynamics common in research and maximizing mutual engagement. For clarity, this report uses the word \"researcher\" to refer to graduate students and university mentors, and \"participant\" to refer to farmer collaborators."}, {"section_title": "Recruitment", "text": "Participants were recruited with a convenience sampling method. Efforts to secure a broader sample were stifled by the relatively small number of regional African American farmers, distance between farms, and declined participation in a couple instances. Participants were sought through personal, academic, and African American farmers' social networks. Researchers approached African American farmers at home, local farmers' markets, and farming meetings to seek participation. Two farmers who eventually agreed to participate were introduced to us at a land loss summit in North Carolina by an African American farmer activist attending the meeting. Additional participants were secured through the network of farmers attending that meeting.\nIn the three northeastern North Carolina counties that encapsulate this study's area, at the time of the 2007 Census of Agriculture there were 122 African American farmers with 104 farms and, comparatively, 1,473 White farmers with 1,027 farms (USDA-NASS, 2011b A site located conveniently within an approximately 20 miles radius of all participant farms, was selected as a central meeting place. Historically, this community has benefited from manufacturing industries such as textiles, tobacco, and cotton for economic growth.\n1 Recently the prevailing industries have changed to include retail, and educational, health, and social services. Agriculture makes up less than 1% of industry, and less than 1% of the population serves in farming, fishing, or forestry as a vocation."}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "The five individuals who agreed to participate in this study (four males and one female) had varied educational and professional experience. All five attended college. Among them, two had had careers as high school teachers in eastern North Carolina, one worked in city government in New Jersey, and another was a computer operator for large corporations. Two participants worked at a nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting minority-owned farmland, two were predominately hog farmers, and one was a vegetable farmer. All but one farmer supplemented her or his farm income with other forms of employment. All of the participants were exposed to farming as children, left their homes to seek alternative opportunities, and ultimately returned home to northeastern North Carolina for farm-related employment. For further participant demographics, see table 1."}, {"section_title": "Procedures", "text": "Photovoice, a CBPR method that uses participant photography to trigger discussion, was used to gather qualitative data. Photography is a tool used in recent history as a form of ethnography, to convey information and to document social change (Harper, 2003) . The use of photographs both to investigate and to create dialogue on competing and complementary meanings is well documented (Harper, 2003) . Photovoice combines and transforms the traditional purposes of photography and critical dialogue into participant and researcher dialectic. In this reference, dialectic is the process and discovery of understanding truth through mutually engaged conversation. Since its inception, Photovoice has been used in a growing number of projects to investigate a range of health and social issues, and has been effective in engaging hard-toreach populations, including those mistrustful or resistant to research (Catalani & Minkler, 2009 however, aims to reflect and act upon community concerns and strengths rather than make broad generalizations. According to a seminal article by Wang and Burris (1997) , Photovoice has three stated goals:\n(1) to enable people to record and reflect their community's strengths and concerns, (2) to Photovoice and qualitative data analysis are appropriate methodologies for an inductive discovery of lived experiences (Catalani & Minkler, 2009 ) and effects associated with land loss. Photovoice methods acknowledge that African American farmers are the experts of their individual and collective experience. Accordingly, an inductive discovery of their experience, the cumulative effects of land loss, and ways to address concerns in their words were sought rather than a deductive understanding of isolated concepts or indicators.\nFollowing the Photovoice process, participants were first asked to collectively develop a photography assignment relating to issues of farmland loss. Next, participants were asked to take photographs related to the topic through the week. At a follow-up meeting the group collectively selected one or two photographs they believed best represented the photo assignment. The selected photos served as triggers to generate discussions and probe for deeper meaning (Wang & RedwoodJones, 2001 ). This procedure was iterated through three distinct photography and discussion sessions. See figure 1 for a depiction of the procedure and timing of study activities.\nDiscussion sessions were facilitated using the SHOWED method, an empowerment educationbased facilitation technique, to: (1) engage participants in comparing and contrasting their individual and collective experiences, and (2) identify their strengths and concerns as farmers confronting the issue of land loss (Wang & RedwoodJones, 2001 ). Using photographs as triggers, SHOWED progressively leads participants from observational questions, through interpretation, to potential action steps for addressing concerns (figure 2). Through the dialectic, individual commentary was challenged by other participants and researchers alike to cross-check legitimacy of experiences in relation to the group, and to foster a new collective understanding. With the consent of the participants and Institutional Review Board approval from the University of North CarolinaChapel Hill, all sessions were audio recorded.\nStep-by-step qualitative analysis was conducted throughout the study including reading, coding, displaying, reducing, and interpreting data (Ulin, Robinson, & Tolley, 2005) . Between sessions, researchers transcribed audio recordings, reviewed content for preliminary themes, and identified gaps in understanding to be addressed at ensuing meetings. At the conclusion of the last Photovoice sessions, a final codebook with 15 codes was developed by researchers from preliminary codes and themes, including definitions and coding rules. A code is a label that is attached to a piece of text to better enable researchers to group and compare similarly labeled sections of information. For example, sections of text were coded \"protective factors\" when participants mentioned or referred to the benefits of farming as it relates to protecting individuals from poor health and social problems. The 15 codes were the result of iterative review of "}, {"section_title": "D", "text": "What can we do to address these issues?"}, {"section_title": "Potential Action Steps", "text": "Journal of Agriculture, Food Systems, and Community Development ISSN: 2152-0801 online www.AgDevJournal.com transcripts and researcher discussions to identify the most prevalent and rich preliminary themes.\nTranscripts were double coded to ensure internal reliability using Atlas.ti software, Version 6.1.8. All sections of labeled text within each code domain were then extracted using the software, and compared to reveal patterns of meanings, or themes. For example, a theme identified under the code \"protective factors\" is:\nParticipant farmers believe farming will create a strong work ethic in youth and prevent them from becoming involved in illegal or otherwise dangerous activities.\nFor some codes, the patterns of meaning were not strong enough to compose a theme. For themes identified in this study, representative quotes were extracted and are presented in the findings section.\nFinal themes were further arranged in three overarching categories. Post analysis, findings were presented to participants to check for accuracy."}, {"section_title": "Findings", "text": "Each Photovoice session provided rich qualitative data that included photo assignment selection, photography, and photo discussions. Through successive sessions, participants developed the following assignments to guide their photography and discussions:\n\u2022 Why we continue to farm despite the odds "}, {"section_title": "Historical and Current Discrimination", "text": "\u2022 Past discrimination resulted in participant African American farmers not trusting governmental organizations and some report continued discrimination on the farm.\n\u2022 The group believed lack of access to loans has led to an increase in the financial problems of African American farmers and has been a factor in the dwindling size of the African American-owned farm.\n\u2022 Discrimination increased the psychological stress of participant farmers, influencing sense of self-worth.\n\u2022 Participant farmers believe that lack of representation in governmental agencies hampers advancement of African American farmers.\nRace-related discriminatory lending practices on the part of the USDA remained a present and pressing concern for participants. Themes identified as related to discriminatory practices were both historical and current (see All participants agreed that disparities in lending during the previous decades strongly deterred African American farmers in their community from applying for needed loans from the USDA. Instead, farmers sought out local creditors for small loans, or managed with what they had, until they depleted personal savings. One participant who continues to farm the same tract of family land he helped with 50 years ago recalled the experience within his community:\nIn fact they [African American farmers] wouldn't deal with loan officers because they know it wouldn't come out in their favor. Instead, it's better just to do what you can, because once you start dealing with the loan officers, they're gonna make it difficult for you\u2026.And they'll use everything they can to prevent you from getting the loan, and then they'll get you in a situation where you've gone so far and then they start now giving you problems with taking your property. Beyond restricting economic advancement, discriminatory lending had the effect of making some of the participants feel as if they were incompetent farmers and, as a result, increased their experiences of stress. In addition to receiving less money from loans, one participant recalled waiting with other African American farmers in lending offices entire days while White farmers came and went. The psychological effect of this was often significant, as exemplified by the farmer who once believed the disparities in lending were a reflection of his abilities, despite later traveling widely to share his farming expertise. He explains the effect of discrimination this way:\nIt takes you to these places, places you don't even want to go [feelings of depression and lack of selfworth], when they treat you like this\u2026And, ah, you know, it's these types of things that we've experienced all our lives. I thought that I was the bad part: well, you know, I'm just no good. But when the lawsuit [Pigford v. Glickman] came to be, and I saw these hundreds and hundreds of people come in, I said, \"Well, I'm not gonna be by myself, and we all can't be bad farmers.\" So then it was the establishment that put us where we are.\nThroughout the discussion, participants agreed that discrimination endured by African Americans in their community deteriorated self-confidence, which prevented them from seeking new opportunities for economic advancement since they expected further rejection. According to the participants, many farming colleagues began to despair about their opportunities within agriculture. This is illustrated by the following quote:\nAnd if I tell you \"no\" long enough, you're going to believe \"no.\" And that's what has happened to a lot of the older folk in the neighborhood, you know, they've been told no, no, no, so much that they just accept a negative attitude.\nAmong African American farmers in the region that remain in the profession, many were noted to have withdrawn from participating both in educational and financial meetings, and the wider community of farmers. Participants attributed this absence to both historic discrimination causing distrust of government institutions, and competing time demands to earn a living. One participant offered his opinion:\nBlack farmers are very shy. We are in bad shape and we don't want anyone to know it-not anyone.\nFor another participant the distrust pointed to a need for yet further reform to deal with what he perceived to be the persisting underlying problem. He commented:\nThe nation needs to know that we haven't eradicated racism. It's been going on, and it needs to be eliminated.\nA couple participants lamented the lack of African American representation in government positions to influence reform, and reported continued experiences with discrimination today. Among One of the FSA loan officers told us in the past \"Use it up, fix it up, do anything, don't buy anything new.\" We couldn't go out and get this piece of equipment new.\nThe ingenuity participants mentioned as imperative for their survival as farmers in the past is seen to have an additive effect when eventually given more equal access to funds and opportunities. Farmers selected photo 2, a biodiesel machine, as a trigger to represent this innovation of African American farmers.

And he wants to get to the point where he can commercially sell it, you know. Right now he doesn't make that much, he just does enough for his farm and enough for demonstrations.\nAs evidenced by the biodiesel machine, the participants strive to be current with emerging agricultural innovations and the changing demands of the market. All participants have taken steps to become certified as organic, discussed at length sustainable practices, and one had recently started preparing free-range lots for livestock in lieu of confinement operations. During discussion on the same topic, participants also noted the success another African American farmer in the state has had in raising turkeys (photo 3), along with other animals and crops, for a decent profit. The creativity with which the farmer approached raising and marketing these turkeys demonstrates the entrepreneurial spirit that garnered a state award for farming excellence. The participant who took this picture interpreted the photo in the frame of justice:\nAnd this one I picked from when we went on a farm tour, and I picked that as justice -you know, showing where we [African American farmers] were able to do some things with some help from some grants and some other justice.\nTo me, that's instrumental changes.\nAll participants agreed that the positive opportunities provided by farming outweighed the difficulties faced. Farming increased their self-reliance and their ability to produce food and provide for their families, a heightened concern in light of the country's insecure economy at the time this study took place. Participants also felt that by farming one could maintain health through the physical activity of working in the fields and by eating the healthy food produced. A participant who raises livestock and vegetables reported on the security farming can provide:\nWe can feed ourselves, and no matter how bad the economy gets, regardless of what anybody else does. All farmers know how to provide enough food to feed their family. That's a necessity.\nThe farmers also shared the common excitement of watching growth-whether it be livestock, produce (shown in photo 4), or the burgeoning future of African American farmers in their community. All participants spoke positively about how farming fostered creativity, allowed them to work in the fresh air, and offered different challenges and opportunities with each new day. Such sentiments inspired one participant to invest in the community by developing a town market Many participants reported that they farmed primarily to ensure that they could pass on their land and profession to their children or grandchildren. A couple of the farmers discussed with regret how they had missed the opportunity to recruit their children to eventually take over the farm while they worked in other professions, or before they came to own the family farm outright. As a result, they see the need to mentor their grandchildren and other youth so as not to miss another generation. A participant who"}, {"section_title": "Photo 4.

Grandchild of a Study Participant Walking Off the Back of a Truck To Help on the Farm", "text": "Photo credit: Photovoice participant. All participants vocalized their concern about the loss of family land outright and the need to provide youth with healthy lifestyle options as reasons to continue farming. Getting youth involved in farming was viewed as a way to build a strong work ethic, to promote physical and mental development, and, as a protective factor, to keep children away from damaging activities like the use and sale of drugs. Concern that the next generation is being attracted to selling drugs and other crimes to make money prompted one participant to start a youth gardening program to cultivate interest in farming.\nIn commenting on the photo of the young boy in photo 5, this participant relayed hopes and fears for the younger generation in relation to farming:\nI see a little boy on a truck. That's what I want to see -more people off the streets and on the farm doing something constructive. That's what I hope to see -more kids off the street and it's hard.\nContinuing the legacy of farming family land was important to the participants and is currently a pressing concern because of the aging African American farmer population as a whole. A majority of participants are retired from their other jobs and are able to devote much of their time to farmrelated activities. An older participant who cultivates vegetables with his brother repeatedly commented on the need and benefit of involving young people in farming:\nAs I said, the young people are out there, and they got the great minds.\u2026I'm an old man, and they got the minds.\nThis participant recalled that a couple of decades ago it was commonplace for young African Americans in their community to seek work on the land. During that time, the children sought farm work to earn money to buy materials and new clothes for the first day of school. Farmers did not have to seek help from the youth; youth sought out the farmers. The trend of African American youth involvement on farms in the region has been decreasing, however, as he explained:\nWell my brother he was here for two generations; he was hiring young youth, but within the last [20 years] things were slowing. He hired a lot of youth. If we were to have a thriving produce business we could have brought some of the younger kids into this kind of operation. So for 20 years in this community we have had very little impact on a generation of youth. And previously we had a lot of impact.\nParticipants discussed how economic influences deter youth from going into farming as a profession. They highlighted two deterrents: (1) the effect of watching parents struggle financially with farming, and (2) the lure of fast money from selling drugs as an alternative to a lifetime of struggle on the farm. This is described in the following statements:\nI think young people my age and a little younger saw their parents work a lifetime, and then got to check-up at the end of the year [with the owner of the farm, usually White], \"you're almost paid up this time, John.\" Gotta work a whole year for that farmer [as a sharecropper], and when that White man paid [you] at the end of the year, you almost made out [paid off your expenses]. Means you got to work another year, you know, go buy shoes for your children, you have to go to that man to borrow money, because he [the African American farmer] don't got any of his own.\nWell like I said, they [children] see there's not any success in his father's farm, so why would he want to go down and be a farmer, and do the same thing his dad did and be a slave the whole time.\nAnd I can understand why I see children nowor boys on the corner selling drugs. Because they see the guy driving down the street, and that looks nice, all that gold around his neck, and got a roll full of money. He doesn't understand the consequences, but for work on that farm, ten dollars -no, five dollars an hour, you can't but make 50 dollars. Five days a week that's 250 dollars, and that boy can stand on the street corner, and in an hour have a wad big enough to choke a horse. And that's what they want, they want some of the finer things, and you aren't gonna get it from a farm.\nOne of the participants warned that the memory of discrimination believed to deter African American children from farming will have further negative ramifications for the nation as a whole:\nI think the nation, when the nation fails, I would hope that they would have enough foresight to realize the importance of the Black farmer before they fail miserable. Because they [the United States] are inevitably on a road of failure, because as I said, they have excluded -maybe not openly, but by not opening the doors of opportunity to young people they have cut off some of the most talented and great minds that could really shape agriculture and deal with the challenges there.\nAlthough the participants reflected that youth in the community are more inclined to pursue other jobs than work on a family farm, they also mentioned that African American farmers held onto their land, regardless, in the hopes of maintaining their heritage. Many had doubts as to whether the individual(s) who ultimately inherit the land will continue with the profession. One participant reported on the continuing trend of children not farming inherited land:\nWhen you deal with people holding on to their land.\u2026They pay taxes on this land and a lot of them will not sell it because they say they want to keep it in the family. And that's where I think this is going to. People are keeping land in the family because they have so many memories of it. But as to people getting out [in the fields] and growing stuff, it's a new day [not happening]."}, {"section_title": "Participant Recommendations to Address Land Loss", "text": "As noted above, the methods employed in this study include a process for participant-developed action steps to support African American farming in their communities. Collectively developed participant recommendations for addressing issues around farm or acreage loss are summarized in table 3.\nThe participants had already taken steps to retain their land and that of other minority farmers through individual initiative and participation in outreach through nongovernmental organizations. Farmers noted that the general public, however, is largely unaware of the history and issues surrounding the disproportionately high rate of farmland loss by African American farmers. One participant \u2022 Continue to raise awareness in public and among government officials about injustices that affect African American farmers.\n\u2022 Promote collective organization and cultivate leadership by engaging the community, including farmers and nonfarmers, through outreach activities.\n\u2022 Facilitate ongoing agricultural education in farming communities.\n\u2022 Pursue funds to develop infrastructure and enable greater benefit from farming education.\n\u2022 Enlist youth involvement in farming activities.\n\u2022 Provide greater access to Internet services to enhance communication efforts and accessibility to information resources.\nrecommended that the public and government officials be better informed:\nWe have to continue to bring about awareness about the injustice that goes on. We have talked to people all the way to Washington, DC. Even having no minority loan officers! Come on. People that are in authority that can do something about these injustices. But nobody applies, no one is qualified. The agencies treat them [African American employees] so bad and they won't go back. We have to make the people in authority aware.\nSeveral participants regularly engaged in outreach efforts to inform current African American farmers about financial and educational opportunities, and to educate nonfarmers about the potential in farming. Some participants recommended that African American churches serve as venues for these discussions because these churches are the primary social outlet for the African American community. Others, however, lamented the limited amount of time available for such a discussion during services and noted the importance of expanding outreach efforts and venues. One participant had already mobilized a group to meet regularly and discuss relevant issues within the community, at which he invited professionals from across the state to speak on specific agricultural topics. He recommended further education:\nI am back to education. People have become complacent. They are used to nothing, want nothing. Let the White man feed you. You can't live on Social Security. Instead of watching \"As the World Turns,\" watch them flowers grow. Give them an opportunity.\nMost of the participants have mobilized groups of children or adults to promote farming, either currently or in the past. All recognized that the progress they have made as farmers was bolstered by organization and teamwork. They recommended the implementation of collective initiatives to get other community members involved, as this quote illustrates:\nOne person being able to achieve is nothing. We have to organize and put our resources together. The loan thing [reparations] isn't about fixing things. I think opportunities, we have to grab opportunities. We need organization, leadership.\nParticipants also believed that widespread access to the Internet would facilitate better communication and access to resources. At present, Internet connectivity in the participants' communities is limited and is particularly poor for African American farmers. One farmer commented on the limited Internet service in the region:\nWhere I live, about a mile from me, another member, she has broadband. But when I try to get [it] they tell me we don't have a substation in your area, so we can't offer you broadband. So I have to pay like $69 a month for wireless, you know, and I really want [Internet access] to follow me wherever I go. So, they put a lot of money in the stimulus package for new technology in areas, but, ah, and that's politics. We don't know because we're cut off. And they say, oh you all don't have cable? Yeah, the one we pulled across the yard.\nFarmers agree that with affordable Internet access they could remain up to date on the latest agricultural regulations and funding opportunities, organize more people with less effort, and develop new markets for their products."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Significant changes have been made to reduce disparities in access to government support for African American farmers (Cowan & Feder, 2010; NCDA&CS, 2011; USDA, 2003; USDA-FSA, 2007) .

According to participants this has included increased access to funding, knowledge of new opportunities, and availability of education. The negative impacts of institutional racism, including discriminatory lending, are evident in this study and the literature (Brondolo, et al., 2009; Jones, 2000; Paradies, 2006) . These findings support prior studies showing that African American farmers who continue farming also continue to endure the negative economic repercussions of years without adequate loans to invest in their farms and the resulting accumulation of stress (Hinson & Robinson, 2008) . The cyclical effect of discriminatory lending in the past affects current investment capacity, and thus wealth of these farmers, and remains a threat for the viability of African American-owned farms today.\nDespite the obstacles, the participants reported continued commitment to the profession, noting that the health benefits of outdoor physical labor, producing nutritious food, and the pure enjoyment of facilitating growth enhance their quality of life. Their experiences have had the positive effect of fostering creativity and innovation on the farm as evidenced by the expansion into alternative fuel sources, the raising of free-range turkeys and other livestock, and the cultivation of new cash crops. Such innovations are seen as necessary for the survival of the African American-owned agribusiness and can contribute to the wealth and broader investment of the farmers (Gilbert, Sharp, & Felin, 2002; Grim, 1995) . Further, small-scale farm owners, like the participants in this study, contribute positively to agribusiness, and promote community vitality through the consumer industries created (Brown, Christy, & Gebremedhin, 1994) .\nThe participants in this study yearn to pass on their farmland and what they view as the \"good life\" to the next generation. To these farmers, the land represents their families' heritage and future opportunities, even with the complex challenges they have experienced as farmers. In addition to the personal pride and quality of life noted by participants, land ownership is associated with the positive educational achievement of children (Gilbert, Sharp, & Felin, 2002) , which is a primary goal for participants. It is critically important to participants that the next generation remain involved with the land to ensure survival of their heritage and to influence their well being. However, participants expressed deep concern that younger family members would choose to step away from farming and the family land because they have become disillusioned by watching their parents' financial struggles with farming and their experiences of discrimination. Participants fear that instead of farming, the African American youth who represent the next generation will succumb to the lure of risky or illegal ways to earn money that have a more immediate payout. These concerns suggest a need for innovative agricultural programs to engage African American youth.\nNumerous studies on the topic of African American farmers confronting land loss make recommendations to maintain the land (Gilbert, Sharp, & Felin, 2002; Grim, 1995; Wood & Gilbert, 2000 "}, {"section_title": "Lessons Learned", "text": "The procedure used to conduct this study led to numerous opportunities for lessons learned, particularly around recruitment and use of the Photovoice process. Recruiting farmers to participate in this study proved difficult. Having little experience initially with the African American farming community, we had no credentials to lend legitimacy to the project. At the outset, we enlisted the help of individuals and organizations who had connections with African American farmer networks in nearby communities and farmers' markets. Through discussions with farmers it became clear that experiences with discrimination, long distance between individual farms, overexposure to researchers, and the small numbers of African American farmers in the area would make recruitment challenging.\nDuring recruitment, we became aware of how our race and class, current and past race relations, and the history of studies done on African American communities worked against us-a team of one African American female, three White females, and one White male. We were graduate students, younger than the age of potential participants, and represented a large research-intensive institution.\nAs public health researchers, we were aware of the long-standing history of African American involvement in research, particularly the Tuskegee Public Health Service syphilis study. Recognizing this harmful history and the potential for distrust in the community necessitated the use of sensitivity on our part when approaching African American farmers and introducing the idea for this project. Access to participants was eventually gained through personal validation by a member of the African American farming community who was involved in efforts to maintain African Americanowned farms in the United States. Securing a foothold in the community through this gatekeeper proved essential for recruitment.\nIn addition to difficulties with recruitment, the demands of farming hampered the study's flow and required constant flexibility on the part of the research team. Participants were preoccupied with work and family responsibilities, preventing some from attending every meeting. Working around farm schedules proved especially difficult during the spring planting season. Following the SHOWED method directly also proved difficult: rather than following the sequential procedure leading from observation, to interpretation, relevance to the lives of the participants, and action steps, the conversations moved back and forth across these categories. Participants often combined observations and interpretations. Periodically the conversation would be brought back to the prescribed question, but, on some occasions, we thought it best not to adhere to the linear questioning in favor of allowing rich conversations to unfold."}, {"section_title": "Limitations and Strengths", "text": "The approach used in this study, including the Photovoice technique, has its weaknesses. The small sample sizes of qualitative analysis and convenience sampling do not support broad generalizations across the population. The aim of this project was to capture the strengths and concerns of African American farmers in a North\nCarolina community in light of historic discrimination and its effect on land ownership. While prior research reveals that discrimination and issues of farmland loss are widespread in the region and it is expected that other African American farmers in the American South may have similar experiences, the specific events and histories related here are unique to these participants.\nPhotovoice also has strengths. This method allowed us to gain input directly from individuals affected by discriminatory lending. Further, Photovoice taps into the rich traditions, history, and strengths of community members regardless of their educational background. Additionally, the use of Photovoice engaged all participants in finding connections between the lived experiences of each group member, and brought a strong sense of context and place to each discussion. The use of photographs as triggers aided participants' efforts to convey these experiences not only in their own words but also from their own perspectives.\nFinally, the iterative research process of Photovoice, with its series of meetings and opportunities for exchange and co-learning, allowed participants and researchers to build rapport and probe difficult issues. Participants were not shy about sharing personal trials, but as the collective level of comfort grew, the discussions and the topics explored deepened. Later conversations allowed all group members, participants and researchers alike, to gain deeper understanding of the challenges faced by African American farmers in this region. Moreover, the Photovoice method created the opportunity for the farmers to explore their experiences in a new light, share those experiences with influential advocates, and generate next steps to address their concerns."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This study illustrates the lived experiences of five African American farmers in North Carolina, their experiences with discrimination, and their farming successes despite that discrimination, in their own words. As the participants noted, this study sheds light not only on the hardships they face, but also draws attention to ongoing strategies and new directions for African American farmers to maintain their farm land. One participant commented that through this study he had gained specific insights into the hardships of people he had known for years. Another participant reflected with others that his problems obtaining loans were not a reflection of his abilities as a farmer, but a systematic history of discriminatory practices. All participants agreed that sharing their stories is one way to address this history of discrimination and to curtail potential future practices. In addition, these farmers, with others across the state and nation, are working together on ventures that will ensure their economic viability for the long term. Innovations include ways to capitalize on the upsurge of interest in local, sustainable farming.\nAfrican American farming continues to be threatened by the lack of interested family members to whom the land can be passed. Participants have begun intentional outreach to recruit younger African Americans into farming. The experiences and perspectives of young, rural African Americans in regard to farming, however, are largely unknown. Participants and researchers alike recommend focusing future research in this area, and view engaging younger African Americans in farming as imperative in reducing further loss of farms or acreage.\nThe Photovoice methodology used for this study proved effective in eliciting rich experiences and perceptions of a group of African American farmers, as well as collectively developed action steps to maintain land ownership in their community. While the small sample size prohibits generalizability, the results can provide methodological and content direction for future studies on this topic. Along with the other action steps developed in this project and described above, this suggests future directions for community research, practice, and policy."}]
